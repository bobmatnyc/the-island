Re: 3.3. v. JEFFREY EPSTE IN
OUR 080303

Dear Ms. Hackett,

As we discussed, I have agreed to cancel the deposition of ASA Daliah Weiss at this time.
Based on the conversations with Ms. Weiss and you. I do not foresee the need at this time to
reset this deposition, but 1 cannot completely foreclose the possibility of deposition in the 'tture
pending further discovery in the Epstein cases. As 1 mentiOned to you, if believe there is
additional information that develops in these cases that would require me to reset Mrs. Weiss for
deposition, I will provide you with notice prior resetting this deposition so that you will have an
opportunity to address the court in a timely manner.

Should you have any additional questions please do not hesitate to contact me at your
convenience.

MANAGED CARE ABUSE PERSONAL INILW WRONGFUL 

Dear Lanna Belohlavek,

 

I am at a lost for words, and trying to hold the tears back, after rea mg about 
sickening details of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's case. I have to say in this instance, your
of'ce along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not
adequately punishing a chronic child molester and rapist. This man of wealth and
prestige preyed on innocent, poor, GIRLS and systematically raped them at his will. He
lived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the
corrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be
facing the death penalty. How can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of
girls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and now be a free man'! How'!! Because he is
rich' Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these
girls makes me sick. Now, I understand the pressure of taking on a powerful person with
unlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any conviction is better than
none can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his cooperation nor
did you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the Victims, your
of'ce could have put this monster away for at least 20 years, if not life.

I'm sure you have read Conchitta Sarnoff' 3 piece on the Daily Beast detailing this
monsters actions. If your of'ce has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as
a cautionary tale on how not to prosecute a rich child abuser and human traf'cker. Now,
I do not know the side story' your investigation, legal technicalities, how much hush'
money was paid out, ect ect. But I do know that after people such as Jeffery Epstein have
raped the entire country of their retirement savings, he shouldn't be allowed to do the
same thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your of'ce did ALL you
legally could have to put this man in prison. However after researching the case, it seems
you failed to come down with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach 
of'ce and the US DA can 'nd further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good!
It would do our society much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the
justice system, especially child molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose
to defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your little sister
or daughterbring this to a full trial with no deals. The American
people deserve better, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the
anger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the
whole of'ce need to know this- that monster doesn't deserve freedom!

Concerned Patriot
