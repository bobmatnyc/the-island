RE: State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein
Case No. 20080F009381A

Dear Barbara,

Pursuant to ourtelephone conversation of November 30,2009 and your subsequent email
to me, I am providing the following information to you concerning Jeffrey Epstein's airtravel
from May 1, 2009 through November 30, 2009.

As you know, Mr. Epstein was in the custody of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office
until July 22, 2009. have confirmed that since Mr. Epstein's release from custody, he has
traveled twice by air. The first trip was on September 14, 2009 when he traveled by
helicopter to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach
County by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only
other passenger. Both the trip and the mode of transportation were pre-approved by
probation. On August 27, 2009 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to
Sikorsky Helicopters in northern Pa!rn Beach County. Larry Visoski and Nadia Marcinkova
accompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of
transportation were pro'approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights
taken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. I am told there are not flight logs kept for the
helicopter but I am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami helicopter trip as well as another
document confirming the September 14, 2009 Palm Beach Miami helicopter flight. I am
also enclosing documents for the August 27, 2009 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters.

On another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State
Attorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of
his probation. None ofthis is true and in fact Mr. Epstein has an unblemished record with
probation without any violations since his being placed on supervision. I note that many
of the false allegations against Mr. Epstein have been brought by the Scott Rothstein law

firm which has since filed bankruptcy as a result of massive fraud by one of its partners.
It is alleged that they used their civil cases filed against Mr. Epstein as one of their more
lucrative devices to perpetrate this fraud. Based on what I have learned and read, there
have been false filings, forged judge's signatures, and forged Eleventh Circuit Opinions.
It is also possible that other third parties have engaged in this conduct by falsely alleging
Mr. Epstein has violated the terms of his probation.

With this in mind, It appears that Mr. Epstein could be a victim of fabricated attacks
designed to do nothing more than question his compliance with his probation and
community control requirements. I truly want my client, as I am sure you do, to complete
his probation without continued false accusations being made against him. I would
suggest a meeting so we may discuss these problems. Given the fact that false
accusations are being made against my client, I would take the unusual step ofproducing
my client for such a meeting if you think it would be helpful.

Please give me a call with yourthoughts on this and whetherthose documents satisfy your
request.

truly yours

Goldberger
