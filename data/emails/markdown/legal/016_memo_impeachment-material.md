MEMORANDUM
DATE: December 20, 2006

FROM: Gerald B. Lefcourt
Sheryl E. Reich
Faith .A. Friedman

TO: Jeffrey Epstein
FILE

SUBJECT: Impeachment Material

 

Set forth below is some of the information that demonstrates that the Palm
Beach Police Department made a materially incomplete and materially
inaccurate presentation of the facts in both the probable cause affidavit and in its release
to the public of the Police Reports, and why the State Attomey's decision to proceed
as it did with respect to the bringing of any charges against Jeffrey Epstein ('Epstein')
was not inappropriate.1 Note, though the Police Reports are on various dates, since they
were released to the public with continuous pagination, we refer here simply to the
'Police Report' and use the numbering provided in the version disclosed to the public.

I. Inaccuracies and Material Omissions from the Police Reports

1. Polygraph Examination and Report. On May 2, 2006, Epstein submitted to
a polygraph examination in which he was asked whether he had '3
contact with Whether he 'in anyway threaten[ed]

whether he was told by 'that she was 18 years
old'; and whether he 'believed was 18 years old'. As set
forth in the Report of the examination, 6 term 'sexual contact' was given an

extremely broad meaning in order to capture any inappropriate conduct that
could have occurred.2 The results of the examination con'rmed that no
such conduct occurred; Epstein never threatened 
told Epstein she was 18 years old; and Epstein believed

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

was

 

 

1 This memo is not exhaustive of facts of which the defense is aware. Nor is it exhaustive of
Epstein's defenses to the accusations.

2 The de'nition included: 'sexual intercourse, oral sex acts (penis in mouth or mouth on vagina),
finger penetration of the vagina, 'nger penetration of the anus, touching of the vagina for sexual
grati'cation purposes, touching of the penis for sexual grati'cation purposes, masturbation by or
to another, touching or rubbing of the breasts, or any other physical contact involving sexual
thoughts and/or desires with another person'.

Public Records Request No. 19-372

years old. Though the results of the examination were given to the PBPD and
the PBPD was given an opportunity to meet with the polygraph examiner in
order to satisfy itself as to the bona'des of the exam, representatives of the
PBPD inexplicably declined to attend the meeting and no information
concerning the fact of the exam or the results appeared in the Police Report;
the probable cause af'davit; or the public release.

Meetings with the State Attornev's Of'ce. On multiple occasions, defense
counsel met with prosecutors and investigators in the State Attomey's Of'ce.
Though there is vague reference to one or more meetings with defense counsel
(see, pages 64 and 87 of the Police Report), virtually no information
provided or evidence from witnesses proffered is included in the Police
Report or probable cause af'davit. Instead, there are misleading or false
references to such meetings. So, for example, at page 64 of the Police Report,
Det. Recarey claims he attempted to reach ASA Dahlia Weiss on December
20, 2005, but she was unavailable that day and for the entire week. In fact, on
December 19, 2005, Det. Recarey met with ASA Weiss and Epstein defense
attorney Alan Dershowitz a meeting at which Dershowitz provided evidence
impeaching '(see below). This evidence included excerpts
from - MySpace.com webpage, which is not only unnoted in the Police
Report, but credited as having been found by Det. Recarey. (Police Report at
page 65.) In another example, the briefest reference is made to a conversation
Det. Recarey had on June 1, 2006, with ASA Belohlavek regarding a meeting
earlier that day between representatives of the State Attorney's Of'ce and
defense attorney Jack Goldberger (Police Report at page 87). Omitted are the
facts of the meeting (Report at 87): In addition to the presence of other
defense counsel, there was in attendance both the polygraph expert who
administered the examination and a who had performed a rigorous
evaluation of Epstein and who concluded that Epstein was
healthy. Both men were made available for questioning by the State Attorney
and the unfortunately, the PBPD failed to attend the meeting. Nor is
there any mention of the presentation made defense counsel in which the
claims being made with respect to*(by then, the sole focus of
any potential prosecution) were rebutted.

 
 

The Video Surveillance Equipment Located in Epstein's Of'ce and
Garaue. Both the Police Report (page 43) and the probable cause af'davit
(page 18) make particular mention of the PBPD having 'discovered' video
surveillance equipment, or 'covert (hidden) cameras' (as the PBPD refers to
them), at Epstein's Palm Beach residence, speci'cally in Epstein's garage and
library/of'ce. By its placement in the probable cause af'davit, it is clear that
the reader is intended to assume a link between this equipment and 'sex
objects' and that the cameras were used for an impr0per purpose. As the
probable cause af'davit states: Det. Recarey 'located a wood colored arrnoire
beside Epstein's bed that contained a bottle of 'joy elly', which is used to
provide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the
second 'oor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein's
bedroom. . Indeed, much is made of the presence of this equipment, noting

 

2 Public Records Request No. 19'372

that it captured images of -nd others. (See probable cause
af'davit at page 18). In particular, the probable cause af'davit notes that 'on

the 'rst 'oor of the Epstein residence . . . [was] found two covert cameras
hidden in clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the
library area behind Epstein's computer. . . . the computer's hard drive was
reviewed which showed several images of' and other witnesses
interviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera
positioned behind Epstein's desk'. (Id) Omitted from the Police Report and
the probable cause af'davit is the fact that the PBPD had known since 2003
about the presence of the cameras, and the speci'c reason for their installation.
The cameras were installed in 2003 after Epstein discovered that large sums of
cash were missing from his home. Indeed, not only were the cameras
installed at the suggestion of the PBPD, but the PBPD initially provided
equipment that did not work and thereafter assisted in the installation of the
equipment Epstein purchased. The cameras ultimately served their purpose
and captured the image of former employee Juan Alessi, removing cash from
Epstein's briefcase after unlawfully entering the house. The recording of
Alessi was turned over to the PBPD indeed, to Det. Recarey himself. The
characterization of the video equipment either as a surprise to the PBPD or as
playing a part in the alleged sexual activity in Epstein's home (even though
none of the complainants ever made any mention of such equipment, or ever
placed any activity in the locations of the cameras), is false and misleading
and suggests an intention to portray the facts to suit a particular goal.

Broken 'Sex Tors' in Epstein's Trash. The Police Report details police
'nding in Epstein's trash what is described as pieces of 'sex toys' and that
these 'discoveries' purportedly corroborate witness statements. Omitted from
both the Police Report and the probable cause af'davit is the fact that during
the course of executing the search warrant on Epstein's home, the police
realized that a key 'sex toy' was in fact the broken handle of a salad server.
Though the 'sex toys' play a prominent role in the Police Report and probable
cause af'davit, the Police Report was never amended to re'ect the discovery
of this new and highly relevant evidence.

Failure to Consider Exculpatorv or Imneaching Evidence. Other
exculpatory and impeaching evidence known by the PBPD was omitted from
the Police Report and probable cause af'davit by, in our view, manipulating
the date the investigation was allegedly closed. According to the Police
Report (at page 85), Det. Recarey 'explained [to ASA Belohlavek] that the
PBPD had concluded its case in December of 2005'. That assertion, which is
false, conveniently resulted in the omission of all information adduced
subsequent to that date. Thus, though the Police Report in fact contains
information obtained after December 2005, the PBPD escaped having to
consider, or even to include in the Police Report, the probable cause af'davit,
or what it released to the public, all the exculpatory and impeaching evidence
presented on behalf of Epstein, most of which was provided after December
2005. That evidence is listed below.

II.

Unreported Criminal Histories and Mental Health Problems of the Witnesses
Relied on in the Police Report and Probable Cause Af'davits.

Virtually every witness relied on to support the Police Report and the probable
cause af'davit has a background that casts signi'cant doubt on whether the
witness is suf'ciently credible to support a 'nding of probable cause, let alone to
sustain what would be the State's burden of proof at a trial. (Indeed, nearly all the
witnesses, and certainly those deemed complainants, were friends, which
undercuts any claim that one story corroborates another.) Though this evidence
was submitted to the PBPD, none of it was included in the Police Report, the
probable cause af'davit, or released to the public. Below we address solely the
omitted criminal histories. Following that, we list other factors that make each
witness unworthy of belief and incapable of withstanding cross-examination at
trial all of which was previously provided to the PBPD but omitted from the
Police Report, the probable cause af'davit and the public disclosure.

Juan Alessi: While the Police Report (at page 57) and the probable cause
af'davit (at page 21) contain assertions by Alessi which allegedly support the
bringing of criminal charges, omitted is the evidence revealing Alessi's
evident mental instability; prior criminal conduct against Epstein; and bias
towards Epstein. As the PBPD well knew, in 2003, Alessi was 'lmed taking
money from Epstein's home. After being caught on videotape unlaw'illy
entering Epstein's home and stealing cash from a briefcase, Alessi admitted to
the PBPD that he entered the house unlawfully on numerous occasions,
stealing cash and attempting to steal Epsteinis licensed handgun (which in fact
went missing). Of'cers assigned to the investigation prepared a report
detailing Alessi's confession. Also known to the PBPD, but omitted 'om the
Police Report, is that Alessi claimed he intended to steal the gun in order to
kill himself. Though this information is clearly material to any determination
of credibility, and was speci'cally known to Bet. Recarey at the time the
Police Report and probable cause af'davits were written, it was omitted.

 

While the Police Report and probable cause af'davit rely
on statements of the father of omitted is
evidence, known to the PBPD, that casts doubt on credibility and
sustainability as a witness. Omitted from the Police Report and probable
cause af'davit is _federal fraud conviction, which defense
investigators discovered and turned over to the PBPD during the course of the
investigation. erved 21 months in federal prison for his offense.

 
 

 

 
 

8. While the Police Report and probable cause af'davit rely on
statements of the step-mother of omitted is

evidence, known to the PBPD that casts doubt on her credibility. Omitted
from the Police Report and the probable cause af'davit is state
conviction for identity fraud criminal use of identi'cation information. This
information, uncovered by defense investigators, was also turned over to the
PBPD during the course of the investigation.

9. was the source of the vast majority of the
allegations made about Epstein. While the Police Report and probable cause
af'davit rely on- numerous assertions, all but omitted is any reference to
the facts known about her by the PBPD, speci'cally, that at the time was
making these assertions

 
 
 

10. 'While the Police Report and probable cause af'davit
contain numerous assertions of omitted is reference to her
long history of contacts with law en orcement. Among those are multiple
runaway complaints by her parents and her assignment to a special high
school for drug abusers.

In addition to the prior criminal history of each of these critical witnesses, all of
which was omitted from the Police Report and probable cause af'davit, signi'cant
additional material information concerning the credibility of these key witnesses was
provided to the PBPD but never included in the Police Report, the probable cause
af'davit or the public release.

11.

 

'came forward' (as the probable
cause af'davit characterizes it at pages 10-1 1), claiming she had knowledge
of 'sexual activity taking place' at Epstein's residence and misconduct by
Epstein. Thus, it becomes clear that-assertions of misconduct by
Epstein were likely motivated by a strong desire to avoid the repercussions of
her which should have been taken into account when
assessing her credibility as a witness.

12. 'Was 18 at the Time She Inaccuratelr Alleges to Have
En gaged in Sexual Conduct wit_h_Epstein. Epstein denies he ever had sex
with - However, even if he did, irrefutable evidence, in the form of a
credit card receipt, was presented to the PBPD and the State Attorney's Of'ce
which demonstrates that any such encounters occurred at a time when
was already 18 years of age. (Indeed, it is our understanding that it was this
information, combined with the character and credibility problems presented
by the facts noted herein, that led the State Attorney's Of'ce to conclude that
'as neither credible nor a proper complainant.) This information, though
own to the PBPD, was omitted from the Police Report, the probable cause
af'davit and the public release.

13. Steals From a An investigation by
private investigators working for the defense revealed that in late 2005-

some three days aftm was caught by a
empte to cave store w1t merc an ise in her urse,

the security tag still attached. (According to a report of the incidenthwas
found 'kneeling on the 'oor digging through her purse'. As the manager
approached, -'pulled out a pair of black SLT panties that had the sensor
on them'.) Seeing the manager, -claimed 'someone is trying to set me
up'. Following an internal investigation, which disclosed additional thefts
from both the store and a customer, she was 'red. (In addition to the theft
above, she was seen by co-workers with store merchandise in her car; she was
believed to have engaged in a fraudulent 'return scheme'; and she obtained a
pair of shoes from another store in the same mall by exchanging them for a
pair of just purchased men's shoes inadvertently left behind by a customer).
In a recorded interview by a Loss Prevention manager, -'admitted to
merchandise theft of $209 [and asserted] 'that her reason for stealing was that
she understood she was not getting paid enough and was struggling
'nancially'. This information and supporting documentation was duly
presented to the PBPD, but was never included in the Police Report or
probable cause af'davit, and never released to the public.

with the taped confession. This information and supporting documentation

Report or probable cause af'davit and never released to the publiclication. Additional

icers. During the course of the investigation by the PBPD and the State's

investigators had impersonated police of'cers in an effort to get her statement.
The defense subsequently concluded that these accusations were made by-
(A reference to this accusation was included in the Police Report (at page 67)
and the probable cause af'davit). Defense counsel immediately questioned
the investigators and learned the accusatiOn was baseless. The investigators'
notes, which describe the investigators' conversation with-efute any
claims of police impersonation. These notes, which were freely reproduced
for the PBPD, demonstrate that the investigators gave-a business card
clearly identifyng them as private investigators. The notes provide
contemporaneous evidence that - initially declined to speak to the
investigators because she said she 'does not speak to cops', to which the
investigators responded they were not 'cops'. Despite having this
information from defense counsel, the PBPD failed to include it in the Police

claims and that defense counsel was investigating a egations.

2006, well after commencement of the PBPD investigation_ was

This evidently false representation corroborates assertions

also contains hssertions that of all her body parts, she 'love[s] her

credibility, was provided by the defense to the PBPD but was never included

V. Juan Alessi

20. Juan Alessi Admitted Burglarizing Epstein's Home and Mental Health
Issues. As touched on above, in 2003, Epstein noticed that signi'cant
amounts of cash were missing from his Palm Beach residence. In an effort to
identify the thief, Epstein had video surveillance equipment installed in the
library/of'ce and garage. Caught on tape was former employee Juan Alessi
breaking in and stealing cash. The Video evidence was turned over to none
other than PBPD Det. Recarey. After being confronted, Alessi admitted to
that break-in and claimed he was suicidal and wanted to steal a gun (which
Epstein maintained a license and permit for) with which he could kill himself.
He took cash instead. However, Alessi also admitted that he had repeatedly
entered the home unlawfully in order to steal money. Although these facts
were known to the PBPD, and in particular by Det. Recarey, Alessi's criminal
history and evident mental instability were not included in the Police Report
or the probable cause af'davit or released to the public.

21. Juan Alessi Lied . Alessi is signi'cant, of course, because the Police Report
includes a statement by Alessi that 'the bed would almost always have to be
made after the massage[s]' (at page 57). The implication being that Epstein
(and presumably the masseuse) used the bed during the massages. Though the
Police Report is devoid of any accusation by any woman that any activity ever
occurred on the bed, no evidence concerning Alessi's motive to lie, his

3 Public Records Request No. 19-372

criminal history, his mental instability or the factual lapses appears in the
Police Report, the probable cause af'davit or the public disclosure.
