Hi Barry I just left. a voicemail for Claudette, but 'gured. Iwould send this to you, too. Our plea negotiations are
not going very well, and I have given the defense a deadline of tomorrow afternoon to provide me with a signed
agreement. If we cannot reach such an agreement, then I need to indict the case on Tuesday and I will not budge
from that date. During my last phone call with defense counsel, he told me. that they have changed their minds
again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not concurrent state and federal. I said that is 'ne, but we will
need a signed non-prosecution agreement (between. the defense and us) by tomorrow afternoon, and an agreement
at least verbally worked out with your of'ce by Monday. Ijust think that Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts
about spending time in jail and paying damages to the girls. I know you are out tomorrow, but if something comes
up, I will call Claudette and e-mail you. Thanks.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN

Je'rey Epstein is a person who, having been raised in modest, lower middle
class circumstances in New York City, parlayed an aptitude for Mathematics, a
teaching experience in a private school, and a chance referral to a Wall Street
executive into a unique, niche business to the wealthy which in turn has made him a
wealthy person. While this represents Je''rey's outward achievement in life, it is
hardly the measure of the man. To those who have known him long or intimately, he is
a loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the
scientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his
largesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himsel' Finally, and most
importantbi, to those who work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary
citizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding
person, mentor, and ''iend. 

Personal Historv

Jeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York in
1953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was
raised in modest lower middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish
neighborhood; efErey's father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City
Parks Department. e''rey's mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in
high school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during
his youth, the family often played a card game called 'Concennation' for entertainment
from which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a
normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.

Jeffrey attended public schools where his aptitude in mathematics became evident
early on. He skipped the third grade at PS. 188 and was subsequently placed in a special
program which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High
School. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayette High
School in 1969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey
attended Cooper Union in Manhattan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.
Je'rey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York
University. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for

spending money.

Public Records Request No. 19-372

Around 1974, Jeffrey decided to try his hand at teaching and obtained a teaching
position in mathematics with an armual salary of $12,000 at the Dalton School, a highly
respected private school in uptown Manhattan which caters to the wealthy. Children in
his classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of
wealthy 'nanciers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been
exposed. As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and
uniquely gi'ed in presenting the material in a way which challenged the students. As
matters would turn out, Jeffrey's experience at the Dalton School would become life-
altering on a number of different levels.

As Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to attend an art
gallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached
by a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially
talented mathematics teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working
on Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at. the time he did not even know where Wall Street
was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns-
During his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admitted that he did not
know what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea
change in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively
based valuation. Based on Jeffrey's mathematics aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a
job on the Spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the 'rm at the end of the school year.

Jef'ey utilized his mathematics expertise in becoming an adept options trader,
and came to know a number of successful investors. His success in the position is
re'ected in the fact that by 1980 he had become the youngest limited partner in the 'rm.
Believing, however, that he could do better on his own on the outside, he decided to
resign from Bear Stearns in 1981. Capitalizing on his knowledge of and experience
investing in esoteric 'nancial instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to
the unique family and 'nancial problems of the 'hyper-rich' gained from his experience
at both Bear Steams and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J. Epstein 
Company (now Financial Trust Company) wherein he acts as a family adviser to the
'hyper-ric The services he provides consist of a broad array of 'nancial advice (on

investment, trusts, estates, asset allocation, etc.) and organization and management of the

Public Records Request No. 19'372

client's family of'ce. The premise for the business is simple, if counter'intuitive:
extreme wealth brings a' host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,
family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied
families possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,
insulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members
affected by the decisions of the family head.l In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential
clients the scenario of 'no longer having to worry about their money.' Jeffrey continues
in 1this unique 'niche' business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey's
business and personal interests currently employ approxirnately 160 people. Of these,
however, he is the only income-producing person.

Jeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied
away from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allow him
the kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey
has had two long-term relationships: the 'rst with Eva Andersson from 1981 to 1990,
and the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from 1991 to 2000. (These will be treated in
greater detail below.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West
Palm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he
was enrolled as a visiting fellow at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

Jeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He
has preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy
and well-known people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2005, Jeffrey agreed to
accompany and 'y former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to
Africa. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that
it did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey's pro'le in the media and

otherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.

 

IJeffrey offered the following example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the
dif'culty of knowing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is
called for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the
implicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family adviser to the client,
however, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur
and absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.

Personal Characteristics

Friendships. Despite his success, Jeffrey has maintained close
relationships with several of his friends from his boyhood on Coney Island. Each of
these friends attest to the loyalty, generosity, and accessibility Jeffrey has always
accorded them.

Kathleen Lindman of New York City, for example, wrote as follows:

It's di'icult to express how much Je'i'ey's 'iendshio has meant to me
over the course of my hi'z, but he is nothing short of being my guardian
angel. I have been blessed with a lifelong 'iend who regardless of the
stresses of his own work and life, always makes time to listen and talk to
me with gentleness, wisdom and humor.

I 've watched Jejj'i'ey grow 'om boyhood into one of the hardest working,
responsible, and generous men I know. For instance, when the time came
to send my son to kindergarten, I wanted him to get the best possible
education but our local public school was a failure and my husband and I
couldn 't a'ord to send him to an independent school. Jej'ey understood
how much I valued education, and empathetically volunteered to cover the
costs of our son 19 education. This past June, our son graduated from
Columbia University with honors, and it would not have been possible
without Je'rey 's long term commitment and generosity.

Terry B. Ka'ca of Dallas, Texas, another friend who has known Jef''ey since
1958, wrote:

From the time we were junior high school students, when it seemed I was
always in need of math and science tutoring until today, when I 'equently
call upon him for business advise, Je'i'ey has always drapped what he
was doing to listen and help. . . .

I am aware of Jeffrey 's contributions to charitable causes and programs.
that he believes will make a difference to mankind and society many of
which are 'ankly over my head. On a personal level, I can attest that he
is also caring when it comes to his 'iends. I recall a few years ago when
he spent a good amount of on-on-one time with my 19 year old son Philip
to help him sort out academic problems he was having.

Warren Eisenstein, O.D., also of Dallas, Texas, another long-time friend from
Jeffrey's youth, recalled a number of ointly shared experiences from their younger days,

including the fact that they both drove New York City taxicabs during college summer

Public Records Request No. 19-372

breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which attests to the playful side of

effrey's nature:

In high school, although we both were excellent academically we were
jokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just
didn take the class seriously. One month before graduation, our phys'ed
teacher called us into his of'ce and informed us that even though we were
'two smart boys we would not graduate because we would get a failing
grade in phys'ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around he said it
was too late. A'er 10 minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jejf
convinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until
graduation. Well, Je'' managed to volunteer as to not only lead class
every day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the
class did including track. Our teacher gave as and we
graduated

Eisenstein surnmarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the

following words:

Over the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success
unattainable by anyone I've ever met. No matter how busy he ever is, no
matter where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Je'f
he was always there. As we 've gotten older, our lives have become more
complicated, 'but we have never missed calling each other on our
birthdays. It 's a small, silly thing, but how many childhood friends do you
know, who have never forgotten your birthday' The most important thing
to me is that as vast a dijference [as] our worlds are, our long'term, deep
seated 'iendship is the strongest lifelong ji'iendship one could ever have;
it's just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even
family. People who are fortunate to have these kind of ''iends are the only
ones who could comprehend this special relationship.

Jeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his
adulthood. In about 1981, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (now Andersson'Dubin), then 20,
who was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still
enduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.
During that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to ful'll her dream of becoming a doctor. He
encouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She
reported that he frequently 'ew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with
her studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to
cheer her on and pay her expenses. She success'illy completed medical school and

presently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.

Public Records Request No. 19-372

When it became clear, however, that the demands of Jeffrey's life could not
include staying in one place and having a family, Eva and he realized that they had no
future as a family unit. They parted amicably. Eva eventually married and has had three
children. This notwithstanding, they have continued to speak with each other nearly
every day (as does her oldest daughter, Celina), having missed only a dozen tirries or so
in the 26 years they have known each other. She described their current relationship as
follows:

Today [Je'i'ey] is a very close and important 'iend to my family. He is
the god'ither of my three children and is close ''iend of my husband as
well. Whenever Je''ey is in New York, he will always come over in the
evening and visit with us, help the children with their math homework, and
conduct science A at the dinner table. He will always remember the
children's birthdays and he is constantly on the lookout for educational
games for the kids. Four years ago when I had a cancer scare, Je'i'ey
was extremely supportive in visiting me everyday in the hospital. I could
not ask for a better friend or godfather to my children

Jeffrey has enjoyed an especially close relationship with Celina, 12. Celina wrote
glowingly of their weekly science lesson when 'Uncle Jeff,' as she calls him, takes time
from his personal and business schedule to go over to her apartment and discuss science
and mathematics lessons she is learning at school. They might talk about such things, for
example, as why the sky is blue or how fast light travels. After their lesson is over, they
then spend some time at the piano where 'Uncle Jeff' helps her work on her singing
voice (even though, as she knows, 'Uncle Jeff' does not have any real expertise in this
area). The closeness of their relationship is perhaps best suggested, however, by an

incident Celina related in her letter:

One of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me happened about 2
years ago when I was at ballroom dancing class. It was father-daughter
dance day and unfortunately my father was stuck in a business meeting. I
didn't know what would do because you had to bring your father to the
dance class. I got to the class alone, but then soon enough a quick phone
call to Uncle Je''didn't leave me standing there, alone for more than 10
minutes. Uncle Je'" substituted for my father that night, and the way he
rushed to the class felt exactly like having my father there.

After Eva and Jeffrey decided to put their relationship on a platonic basis, Jeffrey

entered into another signi'cant relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, then 29, beginning

Public Records Request No. 19-372

in 1991. Ghislaine reported that she had come to New York City at a very dark time of
her life. Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-known publisher, had been found dead
'oating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard ''om a yacht. Her two brothers
were involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they
were eventually acquitted. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.

Ghislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the friendship
immediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.
Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,
and he never allowed her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical
things he could do for her. He gave her books to read good novels, scienti'c studies 
containing issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the
process, take her outside of her personal concerns. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to
comedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her
depression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen
into a deep depression.

Jeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her
get a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey's way of helping friends
with his money is always with a view toward maintaining their dignity. He would never
just give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to
people he does not know, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to
give it back. These gifts are meant to allow the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey
'nds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which
she subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.

Over time, their relationship became intimate. However, as with Eva, it ended
amicably around 2000 upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,
the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,
precluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and ei'ey remain friends to this
day. She wrote of their relationship:

My experience of Je'ey, is of a thoughz''tl, kind generous loving man,
with a keen sense of humor and a ready smile - a man of principles and
values and a man of his word. If he made a promise, he would always
follow through. In fact, I never saw him break a promise. He is

Public Records Request No. 19-372

disciplined in business and conscientious. A man always quick to help
someone who is down, or to offer an opportunity to someone to pursue a
dream or a goal.

Generositv to Educational. Wellness, Civic and Scienti'c Organizations. Jeffrey
has been extraordinarily generous to a host of educational, wellness, civic, and scienti'c
organizations. Between 2000 and 2006 he donated personally, through his business and
interests, and through foundations he had established,2 a total exceeding $16,000,000.
The good generated by his largesse is suggested in the following examples.

Jeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps
none more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish
community at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and
religious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having dif'culties when
Henry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach

Jeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:

At this point I approached Jeffrey and Suggested that a $2 million g'
would allow him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a
tempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity
and the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,
but in essence this is what happened

Je'i'ey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly
did not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also
participate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had
decided by himself or jointly with Wexner that my name should be on
the building because I had been associated with the institution for such a
long time. I 'illy recognized the generosity and modesty of this suggestion
and greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor
but without the Epstein' Wexner participation there would have been no
building. In truth, without Je'i'ey's intervention there would have been no
new building and that would have been an enormous loss to the

community.

The building that now stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-
Radcliffe Hillel at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a
noteworthy aspect of Jeffrey's giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jef''ey wants his

 

2 The Jeffrey Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc. and the C.0.U.Q. Foundation.

Public Records Request No. 19-372

gifts to be anonymous. Where this is not possible, he nonetheless does not seek the
spotiight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected.

Jeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the
Institute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe
haven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such
places as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors
over the last several years of the 'Female Economist of the Year' award offered by the
Stockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were
the original sponsors and creators of 'The Prize for Promise,' a national award program
designed to 'identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance,
courage, dedication, and vision' to encourage them to pursue their chosen 'elds of
endeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey's
generosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former
President Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the
room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate
degree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton
Foundation, and the two students are cmrently enrolled at the City University of New
York where they are expected to graduate in 2008.

Jeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness
organizations. In particular, he has donated signi'cant sums to the Ovarian Cancer
Research Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the
Continuum Center for Health Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and
the Center for Health and Healing.

Jeffrey has also been a long time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in
both New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a
major contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in
New York City by 'nding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty
'ghting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money
to literally dozens of civic organizations in need. These have included educational,
sports, environmental, governmental, crisis intervention, children's advocacy and

women's groups. One noteworthy example is the Antilles School in St. Thomas which

Public Records Request No. 19-372

in 2005 recognized Jeffrey's generosity in assisting 27 students from 24 families to attend
the school who otherwise would not have been able to.

Perhaps the most unique area of Jeffrey's philanthropy is his no'strings attached
support of scientists and mathematicians who are conducting 'bleeding edge' research.
As previously noted, Jeffrey has always had a deep interest in mathematics and science,
and is particularly attracted to research which focuses on the mathematical foundation of
life. By his own admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of
such research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research
'nancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example
of this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist
who predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with Colleagues at
the institute on what has become known as Chaos Theory.

Another particular example is Martin A. Nowak, Director of the Program
for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nowak recently wrote:

Over the years Je'i-ey has taken a great interest in my research worls;
which deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I
have had many 'uitful discussions with him. O'en he would ask
questions, which are surprising for me. O'en I feel that none of my
scienti'c colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too
engaged in our own narrow perspective. Jejjrey's questions and
proposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his
questions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For
example, many years ago Je'rey asked me about group selection, which
led me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that
topic. A bit later Je'rey made me think about interaction nearer-ks
between people. The result was evolutionary graph theory', which is new
field of mathematical biology. Most recently, Je'iey discussed with me
complicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition 'om
chemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful
and completely new research project.

Je''rey has also 'nancially supported my research projects. He has
donated $5 00, 000 to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where
I have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from 1998 until 2003. In
2003, Jejji'ey donated 5 00, 000 to Harvard University, where I work as
Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Professor of
Mathematics and Biology. Both donations were meant to support my
basic research work without any strings attached.

Generosity to Employees and Others. While it might be commonplace to say that
a particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey's history clearly
re'ects this fact on both 'nancial and emotional levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is
quick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally
those who work for him and those he knows. Once he learns of and determines through
conversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,
treats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees
to it that, without strings attached, the solution happens. The issues may be
accommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family
problems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to better
himself or herself; or assistance, both 'nancial and professional, an employee needs to
address the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this
capacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.

Examples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.
Indyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:

Two years ago, a building workman approached Je'rey with news that the
workman 's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman 's sister-
in'law was a willing donor. Unfortunatehz, the sister-in'law was a citizen
of Colombia and the workman did not have the 'nancial resources or
know how to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Je'iey
arranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in'law
and sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law '5 visit
to the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients
recovered completely. The sister-in-law 'ew back to Colombia at Mr.
Epstein 's expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the
high school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education
is now being funded by Mr. Epstein.

There have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for
employees so that they could address signi'cant issues of their personal lives. Several

examples foilow:

A father of one of Jeffrey's employees in the Virgin Islands was recently
diagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for
the father's treatment and has given the employee 'nancial support and
complete 'exibility to take time off from work whenever required in order
to 'y to Florida to attend to the employee's father.

Public Records Request No. 19-372

Lesley Groff, a personal assistant to Jeffrey, reported a number of
accommodations Jeffrey has made, purchase of a vehicle for her
commute, extended maternity leave, a reduced work week and permission
to work from home, which have strengthened her family life.

Lauren Kwintner, another New York City-based employee, told of
accommodations from 2003 to 2005 that Jeffrey made for her to attend to
her father, who had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, at both
Sloane Kettering Memorial Hospital and subsequently the Hospital for
Joint Diseases, until his passing.

Bella Klein, also a New York City-based employee, was a single mother
whose son was accepted to Cornell University; Jeffrey has paid up to 70%
of his tuition expenses; the son now has his Master's Degree and is
working on his 

Harry Beller, a sixteen-year employee, is an orthodox Jew who is required
to be home prior 'to sundown on Fridays and on all Jevvish holidays.
Jeffrey has always accommodated his religious commitments, on occasion
permitting pressing Friday transactions to take place on the following
Monday. Mr. Beller also told of Jeffrey's assistance in making available
any of his contacts in the medical 'eld and to take any necessary time off
when one of his sons was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma.

Jef''ey has been especially generous in funding the educational pursuits of his
employees (and their family members) as a way of assisting them to better themSelves
and achieve their full potential. Mr. Indyke has written that over the last six years,
ef''ey has funded literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition assistance to many
individuals (some of whom Jeffrey has no connection with whatsoever) from the pre-
school to the post'graduate levels. Mr. Beller, mentioned above, for example, has been
the recipient of tuition assistance for all six of his children! Another employee, Emad
Hanna, who was hired by Jeffrey at a particularly trying time of his adult life, told of
Jeffrey's sponsorship of his son's AAU baseball team and of the tuition assistance for his

Je''i'ey Epstein has paid out of his pocket my son is high school tuition for
2 years now totaling around $20, 000 and has given him the opportunity to
get a top notch education at a private all boys catholic high school and my
son has thrived in that environment and averaged a grade of 9] in his
freshmen (gig) year and 'oor all the travel baseball experience he was
able to make the JV baseball team at one of the tap schools in New Jersey.
This has paved the way for my son to possibly have the opportunin/ to

attend a college of his choice when the time comes. I would not have been
able to do this if it wasn 't for Mr. Epstein.

Another example is that of a building worker named Philip Diaz whom Jeffrey is putting
through vocational school in heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Mr. Indyke
related that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and

mentor Mr. Diaz.
A 'nal education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:

While working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a
relationship with the cleaning man who details our of'ce space. Alfredo
and I re'ect life 's issues and family matters as best [as] a Colombian and
English speaking ''iend may, but it takes as deep and a look or gesture
speaks louder than words at times. One night our sign language, broken
English and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter attending
college. Alfredo told me how proud he is of her attending college. 'Me
daughter, she very, very happy. I could see the emotion in his eyes which
led to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically because,
Mister Jej''ey. A'er many such conversations with Al''edo it's clear to
me he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the
dream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such
consequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one
man. This is what my provider, Je'ey Epstein, does for people. If he is
aware of human sujfering he will act quickly, generously, and without
thought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a li'e 's
crisis avoided human suffering eliminated.

Jeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to
face and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings
the same virtues, empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and
generosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke

faced one such problem, and his recollection of it is Worth quoting at length:

Shortly a'er I began working for .Ie''rey, I experienced a personal and
unexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned
that I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional
manner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to
undergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we
could not a'ord and which were not then covered by the company 's
medical insurance.

I meekly approached Je''ey and asked him if it would be possible to drop
my wife and me 'om the company's medical policy in exchange for a

13

different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, .Ie'iey naturally
asked why. When I told him, he was visibly a'ected and without even a
moment's consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the
bills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his
generosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing
news.

In the days and weeks that followed, Je'i'ey personally researched
infertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He
identi'ed the experts in the 'eld to make sure that my wife and I were
seeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the
progress of our treatment cycle.

Unfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I
were hesitant to ask him, .Iejj'rey insisted that we undergo another cycle at
his expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be
terminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were
devastated and once again Je'i'ey offered emotional, as well as financial,
support and encouraged us to proceed. When the third cycle failed and
my wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jef'ey met with me
to go over my wife 's and my options, which now included in'vitro
fertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Je'ey did not
blink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we
were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private
adoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,
while we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jefj'i'ey 's expense.

At the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption
attempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to
continue. Without Jef'ey 's support and stubborn daily encouragement we
would not have. He even recruited his then girl''iend, Ghislaine Maxwell,
to meet with us to ojfer assistance with local adoption and overseas
adaption procedures and to encourage us to try again. hank'tlly, after
our fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters. Although
Je'rey was adamant that we owed him nothing, Je''hey honored us by
agreeing to be the godfather of our children.

The bottom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably
successfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous
human being. His generosity has taken many forms and has bene'ted many people, but
has been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,
educational institutions, 'bleeding edge' scienti'c researchers, wellness organizations,

and civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them

14

Public Records Request No. 19-372

address life problems and reach their potential; to enable educational, wellness, and civic
organizations to better achieve their respective purposes; and, to foster the kind of
scienti'c research which might potentially bene't all of mankind. Finally, in his
generosity, Jeffrey has sought nothing for himself. To the extent it is possible, his giving
has always been anonymous; when this has not been possible, it is clear that he does not

seek the spotlight for these acts.
