RE: Jeffrey Epstein 
DATE: 08/20/09

 

On 8/19/09, at approximately 1635 hours, was advised that Jeffrey Epstein was
walking northbound on South Ocean in the area of Brazilian Avenue. Based on
my prior conversations with Probation Supervisor Gladstone, I made contact with him to
discuss the possibility that this was a violation of Epstein?s order of community control.

I made contact with Gladstone who advised in his opinion that this was a violation and
that based on FSS 948.06, we should arrested Epstein. I advised Gladstone that I
needed a copy of his Order of Community Control in hand prior to making this arrest.
At 1642, this order was e-mailed to my office computer. I reviewed and printed the
order and responded to the area. At approximately 1653, I observed Epstein walking
southbound on South Ocean near the intersection of Barton Avenue. At 1655 I
requested a marked unit respond to Clarke Avenue and South Ocean as was
making contact with Epstein. Epstein was wearing dark sweat pants and a white t-shirt.
He was sweating profusely. As he approached, I identified myself and began my on-
scene investigation. This was documented in the CAD system, CAD #092310146,
a?ached.

At that time, Epstein advised that his probation officer, Carmen Sloan, had advised him
he was allowed to walk to and from work, and that he was now en?route to work. He
further advised that his work address was on Australian Avenue in West Palm Beach. I
questioned Epstein direct route to his work, and why he was
now walking south when he had just been walking north. He stated that he had walked
to the area of the North Bridge, but considered it too busy, therefore he was returning to
the Middle Bridge to cross into West Palm Beach.
