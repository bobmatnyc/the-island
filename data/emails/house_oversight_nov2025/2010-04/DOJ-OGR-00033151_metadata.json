  "body": "Barbara\nIt is obvious you have spent a lot of time on my request for my client and I sincerely\nappreciate the thoroughness and the attention. As my clients case seems to lend itself to\nmisunderstandings and miscommunications by others, I thought it important to clarify some\nfacts assumed in error.\nI have spoken to Mr. Gaines at probation and he confirmed the following: Yes termination\nof supervision on a sex offender is unusual, however a modification to probation from\nCommunity control is not uncommon when the probationer has been in compliance without\nviolation. In fact the department\u2019s current policy on re-entry to the community dictates\nthat an offender be stepped down as soon as possible. He was also under the\nmisimpression, as others might have been, that Epstein\u2019s charges called for sex offender\nprobation. They do not, he is eligible for normal probation. As with many of the issues\nin my clients case, sterile questions that may have been asked tend to lead to answers\nthat though well meaning are not applicable.\nAs for the timeliness of the police reports of the attempted breakins, I wanted you to be\naware that I confirmed with Wackenhut that they called the police each time and spoke to\nthe captain on duty, there should be a record. I said to you it was my advice to the\nclient that he not file a formal report.\n1\nPublic Records Request No. 19-372",
