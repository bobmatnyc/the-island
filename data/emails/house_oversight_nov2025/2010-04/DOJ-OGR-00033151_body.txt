It is obvious you have spent a lot of time on my request for my client and I sincerely
appreciate the thoroughness and the attention. As my clients case seems to lend itself to
misunderstandings and miscommunications by others, I thought it important to clarify some
facts assumed in error.
I have spoken to Mr. Gaines at probation and he confirmed the following: Yes termination
of supervision on a sex offender is unusual, however a modification to probation from
Community control is not uncommon when the probationer has been in compliance without
violation. In fact the department’s current policy on re-entry to the community dictates
that an offender be stepped down as soon as possible. He was also under the
misimpression, as others might have been, that Epstein’s charges called for sex offender
probation. They do not, he is eligible for normal probation. As with many of the issues
in my clients case, sterile questions that may have been asked tend to lead to answers
that though well meaning are not applicable.
As for the timeliness of the police reports of the attempted breakins, I wanted you to be
aware that I confirmed with Wackenhut that they called the police each time and spoke to
the captain on duty, there should be a record. I said to you it was my advice to the
client that he not file a formal report.
