  "subject": "Sally just received the zorro stuff thanks I am sending you this not for you deal w/it this w/e but for next week I need to know what if any list John is using and he needs to understand that he is doing a truly awful job. 1. There was no drinking water in the black Merc 2. There were no pens in the black Merc 3. The bulb on JE desk ws burnt out when we arrived 4. The pool deck was so filthy JE had to ask him to pressure wash it. Is this not the gardeners job and if so why does John not have it done 5. Even thought John sd that he changed the colour card in the computer - having done it could he not see that it was exactly the same as before ie no different and that obviously JE would not be happy w/it? 6.The massage creams etc in JE's bathroom were a mess no one had tidied up and arranged them so it was neat I am at a loss. Plse for a long as we have to work w/him there has to be a list - you need to figure out how to make sure he is doing it. How are we doing w/the PB manual - where do we stand w/t?
