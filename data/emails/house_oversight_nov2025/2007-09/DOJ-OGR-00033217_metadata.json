  "subject": "RE: Meeting with Epstein's attorneys Hi Barry \u2014 I just left a voicemail for Claudette, but figured I would send this to you, too. Our plea negotiations are not going very well, and  have given the defense a deadline of tomorrow afternoon to provide me with a signed agreement. If we cannot reach such an agreement, then I need to indict the case on Tuesday and  will not budge from that date. During my last phone call with defense counsel, he told me that they have changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not concurrent state and federal. I said that is fine, but we will need a signed non-prosecution agreement (between the defense and us) by tomorrow afternoon, and an agreement at least verbally worked out with your office by Monday. I just think that Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about spending time in jail and paying damages to the girls. I know you are out tomorrow, but if something comes up, I will call Claudette and e-mail you. Thanks. A. Marie Villafatia Assistant U.S. Attorney 500 S.
