Re: United States v. Ghislaine applicable policy that prohibits inmates being held
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) in the Courthouse cellblocks from possessing any
materials or items. The circumstances do not
warrant an exception to that policy.
Dear Judge Nathan: SO ORDERED.
I write to request that Court sign the attached proposed order directing the U.S. Marshal
to permit Ghislaine Maxwell to have access to her legal papers while in the cellblock at 500
Pearl Street awaiting the evidence review being conducted in the U.S. Attorney’s Office on the
5% floor. Today, she arrived at the courthouse at approximately 5:15 am and remained idle in the
cellblock until approximately 8:30 am when she was brought to the to the evidence review. Ms.
Maxwell will be attending the evidence review throughout this week.
Your consideration is greatly appreciated.
Very truly yours,
