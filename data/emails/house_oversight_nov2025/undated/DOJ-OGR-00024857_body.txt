Hi-

PRT hei the Washington Post here. We are in the process of working ona story about the cameras outside Jeffrey Epstein's cell on the morning of his death. 1
Can the BOP comment on that assertion? Is the functionality of cameras a larger issue at BOP or MCC? Are you able to say what other cameras might have captured that ni
Thank you,
