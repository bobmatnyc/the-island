Are you ok with this?\n\nBelow is the definition of Psychological Observation provided > | Chief Psychologist. He\n\nwill remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a\nserious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug\nintoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate\n\nHis case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\n\nhe requested Protective Custody.\n\nShirley Skipper-Scott\n\nAssociate Warden\n\nPage 1080",
