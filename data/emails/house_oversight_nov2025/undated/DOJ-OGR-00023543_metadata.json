We are in the process of working on a story about the\ncameras outside Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s cell on the morning of his death. The story will assert that the data in\nthose cameras was found to be corrupted/unreadable, though it is being sent to Quantico for further\nanalysis.\n\nCan the BOP comment on that assertion? Is the functionality of cameras a larger issue at BOP or MCC?\nAre you able to say what other cameras might have captured that night to support the assertion that\nMr. Epstein killed himself?\n\nThank you,\nSEM | The Washington Post\n\n(202) 629M (cell)\n\nPage 580",
