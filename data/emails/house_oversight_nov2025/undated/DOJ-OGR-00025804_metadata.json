  "subject": "Re: Suicide Watch/Psych Observation Update Attachments; TEXT.htm AW Skipper-Scott,  saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow before his Legal visit to see him again. He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night. >>> Shirley V.
