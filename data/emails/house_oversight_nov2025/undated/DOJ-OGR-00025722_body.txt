AW Skipper-Scott,
Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse ener Tews him.
He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He
also said he has numbness on his neck. | informed Nurse
He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is
going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another
cell.
Thanks,
