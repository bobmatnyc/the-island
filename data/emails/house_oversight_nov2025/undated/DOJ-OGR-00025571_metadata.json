  "body": "RS. hs discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will\nneed to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off\nguard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the\nWarden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this\nprobably should be some time after that interview.\nfT",
