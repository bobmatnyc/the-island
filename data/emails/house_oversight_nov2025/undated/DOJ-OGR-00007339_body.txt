It appears that the mail referenced in this letter was sent prior to the Court’s
memo endorsement of the Government’s November 8, 2021 letter. Dkt. Nos.
422, 425. In any event, as this matter is less than two weeks before trial, the
Government is ordered to send materials via FedEx and provide the tracking
number to defense counsel. SO ORDERED.
