Hi Jay -- Yes, I am. I have been spending some quality time with Title 18 looking for
misdemeanors. Oo you want to take a look at 18 USC 403, 18 USC 1512(d), and 47 USC
223(4)(1)(B) and we can talk about them tomorrow? I know that someone mentioned there being
ctivity on an airplane, I just want to make sure that there is factual basis tor the plea
@: the agents can confirm.
I'm not sure exactly where I will be tomorrow morning, so is it alright if I call you?
Have a good evening.
