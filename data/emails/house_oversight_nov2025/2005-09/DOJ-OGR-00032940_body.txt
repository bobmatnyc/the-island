Ed, ;
We're working with Merrill Lynch investment bank and Delta to raise $50
million by selling at a discount the first $600 million worth of jet
fuel from our production schedule. The $600 million will have an
opportunity to be re-invested for equity in the fuel facility to create
an opportunity for additional earnings at the investor's option.
Assuming we get a 3:1 multiplier in this second round, the $50 million
could conceievably net the investors $1.8 billion in less than 3 years. %
We're looking at 10 shares of $5 million each - its all spelled out in :
the enclosed literature.
Let me know if there is any interest by Jeffrey Epstein, or anyone you
know, Let me know what you need from me to help make this happen.
Where possible -and necessary- we have acreed to pay finders fees that
are convertible to share interest.
Once we have the $50 million we'll move the program past feasability to
the point where project financing is possible. The Delta contract is @
worth nearly $18 billion. The value of the jet fuel produced by the
instaliation once complete will be around $60 billion - assuming a 20
year life.
Thanks. *
