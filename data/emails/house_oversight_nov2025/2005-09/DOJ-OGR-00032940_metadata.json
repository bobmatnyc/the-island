The $600 million will have an opportunity to be re-invested for equity in the fuel facility to create an opportunity for additional earnings at the investor's option. Assuming we get a 3:1 multiplier in this second round, the $50 million could conceievably net the investors $1.8 billion in less than 3 years. % We're looking at 10 shares of $5 million each - its all spelled out in : the enclosed literature. Let me know if there is any interest by Jeffrey Epstein, or anyone you know, Let me know what you need from me to help make this happen. Where possible -and necessary- we have acreed to pay finders fees that are convertible to share interest. Once we have the $50 million we'll move the program past feasability to the point where project financing is possible. The Delta contract is @ worth nearly $18 billion. The value of the jet fuel produced by the instaliation once complete will be around $60 billion - assuming a 20 year life.
