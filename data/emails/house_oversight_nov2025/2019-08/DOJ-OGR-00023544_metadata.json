The story will assert that the data in those cameras was found to be\ncorrupted/unreadable, though it is being sent to Quantico for further analysis.\n\nCan the BOP comment on that assertion? Is the functionality of cameras a larger issue at BOP or MCC? Are you able to say what\nother cameras might have captured that night to support the assertion that Mr. Epstein killed himself?\nThank you,\n\nEVO | The Washington Post\n(202) 629-{8)@) (cell)",
