I’ll call you separately in a moment, but just in case email is faster, | just received a phone call from defense counsel that a person
close to Mr. Epstein received a phone call from an individual ee gl who claimed to be an investigator
with the MCC and told the individual that Mr. Epstein’s body was ready to be picked up at the hospital and that the individual
could make arrangements for retrieval of the body[pirc left his phone number as 616-8 |
Can you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is understandably concerned
that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate information through
phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is information like this that needs to
go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his counsel with confidence that it is true and
accurate.
(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein’s body, his defense counsel is extremely concerned
about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would want to confirm
that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that’s only if this is not a hoax, obviously.)
Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body.
thank you,
