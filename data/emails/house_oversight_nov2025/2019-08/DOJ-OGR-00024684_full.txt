Hi, | know you are busy. Following up on this. Also wondering about a few details | see out there:
was this already known? In addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed alone in a cell just two
weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail’s normal procedure, two officials said.

Thankg OO]
1. When was Epstein taken off suicide watch?
2. How long was he on suicide watch?
3. What unit in the jail was he housed?
4. Was he by himself?
5. What's protocol for watching him at 6:30 in the morning? And in general during a 24 hour period?
6. ls there an internal investigation? Are the guard(s) and/or supervisors placed on modified duty/or some sort of restricted duty while
there is an ongoing investigation?
7. Are there surveillance cameras? If so what do they show?
8. What did he use to hang himself?
