# Epstein Little Black Book (Business Insider Interactive)

## Metadata
- **Source**: Business Insider searchable database
- **Status**: Blocked from automated scraping
- **Alternative**: The data from this source likely overlaps with the Black Book CSV we already extracted

## Notes

The Business Insider interactive database is based on the same "Little Black Book"
that was leaked and is available in CSV format. The CSV we extracted contains 1,740
entries which appears to be the complete dataset.

### Extraction Options

1. **Manual Browser Extraction**: Use browser automation with Playwright/Selenium
2. **Alternative Source**: The CSV file appears to be the same data source
3. **Cross-Reference**: Compare CSV entries with any unique entries from BI

### Verification

The Black Book CSV contains comprehensive data including:
- Names (1,740 entries)
- Contact information
- Page numbers from original book
- Associated entities
- Flight log cross-references

This appears to be the same dataset as the Business Insider searchable version.

## Status

✅ Data already extracted from CSV source
❌ Direct web scraping blocked by Business Insider
📊 Consider this source as DUPLICATE of black_book.md
