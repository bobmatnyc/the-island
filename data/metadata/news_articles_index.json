      "content_excerpt": "Alexander Acosta faced bipartisan calls to resign as Labor Secretary over his role in Jeffrey Epstein's 2008 plea deal. The non-prosecution agreement allowed Epstein to plead guilty to state charges and serve 13 months in county jail with work release, while federal sex trafficking charges were dropped. Lawmakers questioned why Acosta's office negotiated directly with Epstein's defense team and kept victims in the dark. Documents showed Acosta personally approved keeping the deal secret from victims until after it was signed.",

The lawsuit, filed under Florida's extended statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse, names Sarah Kellen as a defendant and seeks unspecified damages. Kellen, who has been named in previous legal filings but never criminally charged, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
