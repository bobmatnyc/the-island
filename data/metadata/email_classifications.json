There was no drinking water in the black Merc 2. There were no pens in the black Merc 3. The bulb on JE desk ws burnt out when we arrived 4. The pool deck was so filthy JE had to ask him to pressure wash it. Is this not the gardeners job and if so why does John not have it done 5. Even thought John sd that he changed the colour card in the computer - having done it could he not see that it was exactly the same as before ie no different and that obviously JE would not be happy w/it? 6.The massage creams etc in JE's bathroom were a mess no one had tidied up and arranged them so it was neat I am at a loss. Plse for a long as we have to work w/him there has to be a list - you need to figure out how to make sure he is doing it. How are we doing w/the PB manual - where do we stand w/t?

I give him an additional sum of money specifically to work for us which includes going to JE's mothers hse every Saturday. I would like you to talk to John about this after we have left. If Jerome is not giving us extra hours I need to review what we do w/him or talk to him and give him an opportunity to do the extra time - probably you should take to him first. Thanks G PS The universal remote control for the big TV next to my desk has no batteries and the other romotes do not appear to be working. Worse the TV still is not mended, everything appears in double. I thought that this had been mended? and if not why not and when??? At 06:46 PM 5/25/2001 -0700, you wrote: Ms. Maxwell: I'm ALSO at a loss...!!! John and I specifically talked last week about how important these details are. About two weeks ago I faxed your check off lists to John in preparation for the manual. These are the lists you made and I'd say they are at least 3/4 complete. (This is the third time I've reviewed these lists with him since I've started.) He stated the lists are complete although I definitely want to add to them and edit them as your needs change. He also assured me that he checks the lists prior to each visit. He showed me a white notebook (maybe 6 weeks ago?) on the shelves in the kitchen where he keeps the lists that he checks off, signs and dates before each visit. FIVE of the six items you mentioned are on the list! I'm not sure about #5 (are you referring the changing the ink cartridge?) John CLEARLY understands he is to check Mr. E's computer prior to each arrival. I'm quite sure of this because we've discussed it several times and as recently as my visit last week. As for as your second email, the Band-Aids are on the list titled \"Supplies needed in the house at all times\" which is part of his check off list. Our Household Manual draft does indicate where to purchase \"cleaning supplies\u201d (Publix and Sam's Club-PB Gardens) and states \"use only Tide with bleach, downy softener(switch fragrance every 2-3 month), bounce dryer sheets\" We did edit and review this information last week however we have not completed an inventory list/check off list of supplies yet. SOVERNMENT I believe we have a GOOD start on the manual but it's certainly not up to 404 our standards and needs further work and detail. I'd really like to add aE SRN more detail prior to making a change in Management. If we had uninterrupted DOJ-OGR-00015681",

The $600 million will have an opportunity to be re-invested for equity in the fuel facility to create an opportunity for additional earnings at the investor's option. Assuming we get a 3:1 multiplier in this second round, the $50 million could conceievably net the investors $1.8 billion in less than 3 years. % We're looking at 10 shares of $5 million each - its all spelled out in : the enclosed literature. Let me know if there is any interest by Jeffrey Epstein, or anyone you know, Let me know what you need from me to help make this happen. Where possible -and necessary- we have acreed to pay finders fees that are convertible to share interest. Once we have the $50 million we'll move the program past feasability to the point where project financing is possible. The Delta contract is @ worth nearly $18 billion. The value of the jet fuel produced by the instaliation once complete will be around $60 billion - assuming a 20 year life.

Our plea negotiations are not going very well, and  have given the defense a deadline of tomorrow afternoon to provide me with a signed agreement. If we cannot reach such an agreement, then I need to indict the case on Tuesday and  will not budge from that date. During my last phone call with defense counsel, he told me that they have changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not concurrent state and federal. I said that is fine, but we will need a signed non-prosecution agreement (between the defense and us) by tomorrow afternoon, and an agreement at least verbally worked out with your office by Monday. I just think that Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts about spending time in jail and paying damages to the girls. I know you are out tomorrow, but if something comes up, I will call Claudette and e-mail you. Thanks. A. Marie Villafatia Assistant U.S. Attorney 500 S.

He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation. Sent from my iPhone <Charisma Edge. vcf> DOJ-OGR-00025323",

This is highly misleading. As you know (and AG Sessions and DAG Rosenstein were also acutely aware of), over the 5 years leading into this administration our prison population had dropped 40,000 inmates, but our staffing had gone up (and pop has continued to drop another almost 9,000 since the start of the Administration)! The drop in staffing that they are referring to also likely includes the 5156 unfunded vacant positions that were eliminated...positions we never could fill in the first place. > > We do not need more staff, we just need to fill the vacancies we have.  continue to point out to anyone that will listen (and have reiterated this in several Hill briefings), the problem is not our authorized staffing levels or funding, rather it is finding good candidates to come work for us in hard to fill areas.  have dozens of examples where we post jobs, get 30 applicants and only 10 end up actually coming on board. At that rate it will take a long time just to fill the vacancies we have. We are working on several new initiatives to try and make BOP more attractive to applicants (unfortunately news like this does not help). > > Anyway,  know you know this, but also want you to know that we are working to change this narrative, but right now we are getting drowned out by the media hysteria.
