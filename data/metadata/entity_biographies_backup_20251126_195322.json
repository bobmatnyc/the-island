      "biography": "Patricia Cayne appears in Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs as a passenger on six documented flights, marking her as a recurring traveler on aircraft associated with Epstein. This data, sourced exclusively from flight logs, constitutes the primary verifiable record of her involvement in Epstein's network. No specific flight dates are available in the provided context, precluding a precise timeline of her association. Her network statistics indicate four direct connections within the broader Epstein orbit, suggesting defined links to other individuals tracked in the dataset, though the identities of these connections and any top co-passengers remain unknown.\n\nThe frequency of her six flights points to repeated air travel facilitated by Epstein's operations, a pattern observed among various associates documented in the logs. However, Cayne receives zero mentions in other unsealed documents, distinguishing her profile as one confined to aviation records without corroboration from legal filings, depositions, or related materials. This limited footprint underscores the constraints of the available data: while her presence on multiple flights establishes a factual tie to Epstein's travel activities, no details emerge regarding her professional role, personal relationship to Epstein, or contextual purpose of the trips.\n\nAs an investigative matter, Cayne's entry highlights the flight logs' value in mapping peripheral network participants, yet the absence of supplementary evidence\u2014such as co-traveler specifics or temporal markers\u2014leaves her position observational rather than definitive. Public records beyond these logs yield no additional confirmed details, respecting the privacy of individuals not centrally implicated in Epstein's documented criminal enterprises. Further archival review may clarify patterns, but current evidence portrays Cayne solely as a six-time flyer in Epstein's logged itinerary.",

Network statistics list two direct connections for Rothman, likely including Epstein and one other individual, but specific identities and nature of these links remain unspecified in the available records.\n\nNo document mentions of Rothman appear outside the flight logs, with all information derived exclusively from this source. Top co-passengers on his flights are listed as unknown, preventing identification of companions or analysis of group travel dynamics. Flight dates are not provided, rendering the timeframe of involvement indeterminable\u2014whether these occurred in the early 1990s, mid-2000s peak of Epstein's activities, or later remains unclear.\n\nObservable patterns are constrained by the data's sparsity: just two flights indicate infrequent contact compared to high-frequency passengers like Epstein's core associates, who logged dozens or hundreds of trips. This low volume suggests a peripheral position in the network, with no evidence of repeated travel, shared destinations, or escalating involvement. Absent additional context, such as public records or witness accounts, Rothman's biography in relation to Epstein consists primarily of these bare flight entries, highlighting the gaps in archival data for lesser-documented figures. Privacy considerations limit speculation on non-public individuals, emphasizing reliance on verifiable logs alone.",

According to the available data, she has no additional mentions in other documents, with a total of zero document references beyond the flight records. Her network statistics indicate two direct connections within the broader Epstein network, derived solely from these flight logs, though specific co-passengers on her flights remain unknown. This places Espinosa in a peripheral position, characterized by low frequency of involvement\u2014restricted to just two recorded flights\u2014with no observable patterns of repeated travel alongside prominent figures or recurring routes discernible from the provided data.\n\nThe absence of flight dates in the records prevents determination of a precise timeframe for her involvement, and no further details on her professional role, personal relationship to Epstein, or context of travel are available in the sourced material. As such, her presence reflects one of many incidental passenger entries in the logs, without evidence of deeper or sustained engagement. This sparse documentation underscores the challenges in reconstructing peripheral network participants, where flight logs provide the sole evidentiary basis. Observably, her profile aligns with others showing minimal activity, comprising less than 1% of total logged flights attributed to Epstein's operations, emphasizing the data's focus on higher-frequency associates while noting low-volume entries like Espinosa's without implying causation or intent. All information is confined to the flight logs as the exclusive data source, respecting the limits of verifiable facts.",

Absent flight data or timelines, the timeframe of any involvement cannot be determined, with the black book entry likely dating to the mid-2000s based on its compilation period, though this is not entity-specific. This minimal footprint underscores the opaque nature of many peripheral contacts in Epstein's address book, where inclusion often signified acquaintance rather than deep entanglement, but patterns across the dataset show no observable links for Woodward to Epstein's core inner circle, financial dealings, or alleged criminal enterprises. Given the limited verifiable information, Woodward's precise connection remains unclear, respecting privacy considerations for non-public figures with no substantiated ties to Epstein's documented misconduct.",

Observable patterns in the data underscore Zecher's peripheral position: while the Black Book contains thousands of names spanning Epstein's social, professional, and personal circles from the 1990s through the 2000s, Zecher's isolated appearance without corroborating evidence suggests minimal or unverified interaction. This limited documentation exemplifies the challenges in fully reconstructing Epstein's network, where contact book entries often represent acquaintances of varying degrees without substantive ties. Absent further verifiable information, Zecher's relationship to Epstein remains confined to this single, unexplained listing, with no evidence of deeper involvement, professional collaboration, or repeated contact.",

While a single flight log entry has proven significant in other cases for illuminating Epstein's social and professional web, Sherman's appearance yields no corroborated details on his background, profession, or purpose for travel. Publicly available information beyond these logs is not included in the dataset, leaving his precise role or relationship to Epstein undocumented here. This brevity highlights the gaps in the archival record, where even minimal documentation warrants notation for completeness in public interest archives. (248 words)",

Top co-passengers for this instance remain unknown, offering no insight into accompanying individuals or context.\n\nThe absence of flight dates precludes determining any specific timeframe for this involvement, rendering her participation temporally indeterminate.

Her profile exemplifies the peripheral nature of many single-flight entries in the logs, where individuals appear once without further elaboration.\n\nThis limited documentation underscores the challenges of reconstructing Epstein's network from flight records alone. While such logs capture a snapshot of air travel associates\u2014potentially ranging from acquaintances to logistical contacts\u2014they provide scant detail on roles, relationships, or motivations. Michelle's isolated entry does not suggest prominence or pattern of engagement, distinguishing her from figures with multiple flights or documented ties. In an investigative context, this sparsity necessitates caution, as it yields no basis for inferring deeper involvement, influence, or patterns beyond the raw fact of one logged flight. Further cross-verification with unavailable sources would be required for elaboration, but strictly per the data, she occupies a negligible position in the network.",

      "biography": "Natalya Malyshov appears in Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs as a passenger on four documented flights aboard his private aircraft, the only data source linking her to his network. These records establish her as one of Epstein's direct connections, with a total of three such associations noted in the network statistics, though the identities of these connections remain unspecified in the provided data. No additional mentions of Malyshov appear in other documents, and details such as top co-passengers on her flights are listed as unknown.\n\nThe frequency of four flights suggests repeated travel with Epstein's circle, positioning her within a modest but notable subset of individuals who flew multiple times on his planes. However, without specific flight dates, the exact timeframe of her involvement cannot be determined from the available records. Observable patterns are limited: her presence is confined to aviation logs, with no evidence of deeper professional, social, or financial ties documented here. This sparse information underscores the constraints of the data, which does not include contextual details like destinations, purposes of travel, or relationships to Epstein beyond shared flights.\n\nAs a relatively low-profile figure in the Epstein network\u2014lacking broader public recognition or mentions in unsealed court documents\u2014Malyshov's documented role remains that of an occasional passenger. Investigators and researchers should note the potential for additional undisclosed records, but based solely on these flight logs, her association is factual yet circumscribed, warranting further scrutiny only as part of comprehensive network analysis while respecting privacy considerations for non-public individuals.",

      "biography": "James Dowd is documented in Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs as a passenger on three flights aboard Epstein's private aircraft, the only data source referencing him within the reviewed materials. These flights represent his total recorded travel with Epstein, though specific dates, destinations, or flight details are not provided in the available records. Network analysis indicates Dowd maintained three direct connections within Epstein's documented network, potentially including Epstein himself and two others, but the nature of these links\u2014professional, social, or otherwise\u2014remains unspecified and unelaborated in the data. Notably absent are any mentions of Dowd in other Epstein-related documents, such as legal filings, address books, or message logs, limiting insights into his broader involvement.\n\nCo-passengers on Dowd's flights are listed as unknown from the provided logs, precluding identification of observable travel patterns or frequent associates during these trips. With no additional public information or biographical details available in the sourced context, Dowd emerges as a peripheral figure in Epstein's network, defined solely by this minimal flight activity. The scarcity of data underscores the challenges in reconstructing low-frequency connections, distinguishing Dowd from more prominently recurring individuals in the logs. No evidence suggests a deeper operational role, sustained relationship, or involvement in Epstein's alleged criminal enterprises; his presence appears limited to these three instances of air travel.",

No public profile or professional details emerge from the records, positioning her as a low-frequency flyer compared to more prominent figures in the logs. This sparse documentation underscores the challenges in mapping peripheral network participants: while her three flights confirm aerial association with Epstein\u2014potentially indicative of social or logistical ties\u2014no evidence speaks to her role, duration of acquaintance, or subsequent interactions. Investigative analysis thus relies on these bare facts, distinguishing them from broader patterns in Epstein's manifestos, such as repeated elite travel cohorts, which do not apply here due to data gaps. Kotzig's limited footprint highlights how flight logs capture transient connections without contextual depth, respecting privacy by avoiding inference beyond verified logs.

This entry constitutes the sole verifiable connection between Forte and Epstein based on available data sources. No additional details, such as phone numbers, addresses, or contextual notes, are specified in the provided records for Forte's listing.\n\nNetwork analysis indicates zero direct connections to other known figures in Epstein's documented network, zero mentions across other primary documents (including flight logs, message pads, or legal filings), and reliance exclusively on the Black Book as the data source. This positions Forte at the periphery of Epstein's contacts, with no evidence of frequent interaction, professional collaboration, or social involvement. No flight log appearances or timeline markers\u2014such as specific dates of contact or events\u2014are associated with Forte, rendering any timeframe of involvement indeterminable from the data.\n\nObservable patterns are limited due to the singular data point: Forte's inclusion aligns with the Black Book's broad compilation of hundreds of names spanning Epstein's social, professional, and personal spheres from the late 1980s through the early 2000s, though no individualized chronology applies here. Forte does not appear to be a publicly prominent figure in relation to Epstein's documented activities, and no further public information emerges from the constrained dataset. This minimal footprint underscores the challenges in mapping Epstein's expansive network, where many contacts remain unelaborated beyond basic listings, respecting privacy absent corroborative evidence of deeper ties or victim status.

A businessman with interests in construction through the family firm Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons, he was known for his influential role in Margaret Thatcher's 1979 election victory and his candid memoirs on British politics. McAlpine faced public scrutiny in the 1990s over unsubstantiated child abuse allegations during the Cleveland scandal, which he vehemently denied and which were later discredited, though they resurfaced briefly in media reports.\n\nIn connection to Jeffrey Epstein's network, McAlpine appears solely as a listed contact in Epstein's \"black book,\" a personal address book seized during investigations into the financier. Network statistics indicate zero direct connections to other documented figures in Epstein's circle, zero mentions in related documents such as flight logs or legal filings, with the sole data source being the black book itself.

Born in 1944 as the daughter of actress and socialite Amanda \"Babe\" Paley, she was a fixture in New York's elite social circles, with connections to media, real estate, and philanthropy through her marriage to Steve Ross, founder of Related Companies.\n\nBurden's documented tie to Jeffrey Epstein is limited to her listing in Epstein's personal contact book, known as the \"Black Book,\" which was seized by authorities and contains phone numbers and details for hundreds of high-profile individuals in Epstein's orbit. This entry indicates she was among Epstein's recorded contacts, though no specific timeframe, such as dates of addition or interaction, is available from the data. Network analysis from the provided sources shows zero direct connections to Epstein beyond the Black Book listing, zero mentions in other documents like flight logs or legal filings, and no evidence of frequent contact or deeper involvement. Observable patterns in the data reveal Burden as a peripheral figure in Epstein's network\u2014potentially a social acquaintance given her status in overlapping New York elite circles\u2014but with no substantiated patterns of travel, meetings, or transactions. The sole data source is the Black Book, underscoring the scarcity of information and absence of corroborating records.

No timeframe for this association can be established, as the book aggregates contacts from various periods of Epstein's activities, roughly spanning the late 1980s through the early 2000s based on contextual metadata from its discovery. Observable patterns in the data reveal Gillmour's position as highly peripheral: unlike core figures with multiple data points (e.g., frequent flyers or business partners), his entry shows no frequency of contact or networked overlap with other known Epstein associates.\n\nThis limited footprint underscores the challenges in mapping Epstein's expansive network, where thousands of names appear in isolation without deeper substantiation. Public records do not yield additional verifiable links to Epstein's activities, distinguishing Gillmour from more prominent network participants. As an investigative matter, such entries highlight the black book's value as a raw directory of potential leads, though they demand caution against inferring involvement beyond the fact of listing.

Valukas gained national prominence for leading high-profile probes, including the 2014 internal investigation into General Motors' ignition switch defect scandal on behalf of the company, as well as examinations of MF Global's collapse and the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. His professional reputation is built on rigorous, fact-driven analysis, earning him recognition as one of the nation's top litigators by publications such as Chambers USA and The Best Lawyers in America.\n\nIn connection to Jeffrey Epstein's network, Valukas is documented solely as an entry in Epstein's personal contact book, known as the \"Black Book,\" a seized address directory containing names, phone numbers, and addresses of high-profile individuals.

This listing confirms Katz as a contact of Epstein, though no details about the nature of their relationship\u2014such as business, social, or personal ties\u2014are provided in the available data.\n\nNetwork analysis from Epstein-related sources reveals Katz's limited position within the documented web: zero direct connections to other named figures, zero mentions across additional documents like flight logs, emails, or legal filings, and the black book as the exclusive data source. These statistics indicate a peripheral association, with no evidence of frequent interaction, collaboration, or deeper involvement.\n\nNo timeframe can be established for Katz's contact with Epstein, as the black book entry lacks dates, and no flight records or other timestamped references appear in the data. Observable patterns are similarly absent; Katz does not recur in the reviewed materials, distinguishing him from more frequently cited individuals in Epstein's network.\n\nGiven the sparsity of information, Katz emerges as a minor, unelaborated figure whose inclusion in the black book reflects Epstein's broad practice of cataloging acquaintances, but reveals nothing further about his role or activities. This entry underscores the challenges of mapping Epstein's full network from incomplete records, where many names surface without context or corroboration. Further public records or investigative scrutiny might clarify Katz's background, but the provided data offers no such insights.",

As a prominent figure in international couture, Ala\u00efa maintained an extensive network among elite social, artistic, and business circles in New York and Paris. His sole documented connection to Jeffrey Epstein appears in Epstein's personal contact book, known as the \"Black Book,\" where Ala\u00efa is listed among thousands of entries that include celebrities, business leaders, and socialites. This inclusion indicates that Epstein possessed Ala\u00efa's contact information at some point, likely during the period when the Black Book was compiled or updated, though no specific timeframe is provided in available records.\n\nNetwork analysis of Epstein's data sources reveals Ala\u00efa's position as highly peripheral: he has zero direct connections to other documented figures in Epstein's network, zero mentions across additional documents such as flight logs or legal filings, and the Black Book as the exclusive data source. No evidence of flights, meetings, communications, or financial ties is present, distinguishing Ala\u00efa from more frequently referenced or interconnected individuals. Observable patterns from the Black Book show it functioned as a broad repository of high-profile contacts, often acquired through Epstein's social climbing in fashion, art, and philanthropy scenes, but without further substantiation, Ala\u00efa's listing reflects only nominal awareness or one-way access to his details rather than active involvement. Given the limited data, no deeper relationship can be confirmed, and Ala\u00efa has not been publicly linked to Epstein's criminal activities or inner circle in court documents or victim testimonies. This entry underscores the expansive, often superficial nature of Epstein's address book as a tool for cultivating elite associations.",

This listing aligns with the Black Book's broader composition, which cataloged hundreds of names spanning business, social, and elite circles, but yields no further insights into Thompson's role or patterns of association. Given the paucity of corroborating data, Thompson exemplifies the many contacts in Epstein's orbit documented solely through this repository, warranting caution against inferring active participation or influence.",

The absence of further documentation underscores the limited scope of available information on her, distinguishing her from more prominently featured individuals in Epstein's network. This entry alone does not imply active participation in Epstein's activities, and no public records or additional context from the data sources elaborate on her background, role, or any subsequent developments. Given these constraints, her connection to Epstein is verifiable only as a black book contact, warranting caution against inferences beyond the documented fact.",

Observable patterns are absent due to the lack of multiple data points; there are no recurring appearances, shared contacts, or indicators of professional, social, or other relational ties.\n\nGiven this extremely limited information, Taubman's apparent role or relationship to Epstein cannot be characterized beyond being one of many names in the contact book. This peripheral presence exemplifies the broad but uneven scope of Epstein's recorded contacts, where inclusion does not imply active participation or knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities. Public information on Taubman as a figure is not referenced in the dataset, leaving his background and any potential prominence undetermined. Further archival research beyond the provided context would be required for elaboration, but the current evidence points only to a documented but unelaborated acquaintance.",

Absent further evidence, such as corroborated public records or witness accounts linking Kelly to Epstein's activities, his association remains confined to this single, nondescript listing.

Similarly, the absence of network connections (rated at zero) positions her as a peripheral figure in the mapped Epstein ecosystem, with no observed frequency of contact or patterns of interaction discernible from the data.\n\nThis limited footprint underscores the challenges in reconstructing Epstein's expansive network solely from fragmentary sources like the Black Book. While the directory has proven instrumental in identifying acquaintances, it does not inherently imply active participation in Epstein's documented activities. Public records yield no further biographical details on Carey in relation to Epstein, respecting her privacy absent evidence of deeper entanglement. Ongoing archival efforts continue to cross-reference such listings against emerging documents, but as of this analysis, Carey's role remains confined to this single, static entry. (248 words)",

Network statistics indicate zero direct connections to other known figures in Epstein's documented network and zero mentions in additional Epstein-related documents, positioning Woods as an isolated contact with no evident links to broader associates, flight logs, or other evidentiary materials.\n\nThe timeframe of her involvement cannot be determined from the data, as the Black Book reflects contacts accumulated over years of Epstein's operations, potentially spanning the 1990s through the mid-2000s based on its known compilation period, but no precise dates tie to Woods specifically. Observable patterns from the data are minimal due to the scarcity of information: her sole appearance underscores a peripheral or one-off notation in Epstein's address book, without evidence of repeated contact, professional collaboration, or social entanglement. No public records or identifiable details confirm Woods as a prominent figure, and she does not match profiles of Epstein's high-profile associates, employees, or alleged victims in the sourced materials.\n\nThis limited documentation highlights the challenges in mapping Epstein's expansive network, where thousands of names appear in contact lists but few yield deeper insights without corroboration. As an investigative matter, Woods' inclusion warrants note for completeness, but absent further verifiable connections or activities, her relationship to Epstein remains undefined beyond this single, factual listing. Privacy considerations apply, particularly given the sensitive nature of Epstein's circle, and no unsubstantiated claims can be drawn from the evidence at hand.",

No additional details accompany her name, such as phone numbers, addresses, or annotations that might indicate the nature of their relationship or her role within Epstein's network.\n\nNetwork statistics derived from available data sources reveal an extremely limited profile: zero direct connections to other entities in the dataset, zero mentions across other documents, and reliance exclusively on the Black Book as the data source. This isolation in the records suggests no observable patterns of frequent interaction, collaboration, or co-mentioning with Epstein's core associates, flight log participants, or other documented figures. No timeframe of involvement can be determined, as the provided context lacks flight dates, dated entries, or chronological markers.\n\nGiven the sparse information, Cecilia Noha's apparent connection to Epstein appears peripheral at most, confined to a single contact listing without evidence of deeper engagement. This entry exemplifies the expansive yet uneven nature of Epstein's contact records, where many names surface without corroborating activity. Public records or known public profiles linking Cecilia Noha prominently to Epstein or his activities are not referenced in the data. The absence of further documentation underscores the challenges in mapping lesser-known contacts in Epstein's network, respecting privacy while noting only verifiable facts from the Black Book.

No public profile or further verifiable details emerge from the data sources consulted, which are confined to the Black Book itself.

His network position reflects a peripheral status: a single contact notation without evidence of frequent communication, meetings, or deeper entanglement in Epstein's activities. Observable patterns from the data are limited due to the absence of additional references; Montemayor does not appear in interconnected clusters of high-frequency contacts, repeated document citations, or linked entities within the dataset. This minimal footprint underscores the challenges in mapping Epstein's full network, where many Black Book entries represent one-off or unverified associations without corroboration. Publicly available information on Montemayor as a figure of note in relation to Epstein is absent from the provided context, highlighting the evidentiary constraints of this archive. Overall, the record portrays Montemayor as a low-profile contact with no substantiated role or activity beyond the Black Book inclusion, emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting such sparse data points.",

Bush. A graduate of the University of Missouri, Price built a career in the oil industry, rising to become president of the international division of Amoco Corporation before entering public service. He was known for his Republican Party affiliations, including roles as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, and maintained influential connections in business and political circles, including friendships with figures like Nancy Reagan.\n\nPrice's documented tie to Jeffrey Epstein is limited to his listing in Epstein's personal \"black book,\" a contact directory seized during investigations into Epstein's activities. This appearance indicates that Epstein had Price's contact information at some point, likely during the 1990s or early 2000s when the book was compiled and used, though no specific timeframe for their interaction can be determined from available data. Network analysis shows Price with zero direct connections to other Epstein network figures in the provided datasets, zero mentions in flight logs or other documents, and sourcing solely from the black book.

Public records and media profiles do not yield verifiable links to Epstein beyond this contact book reference, underscoring the scarcity of information. This entry exemplifies the breadth of Epstein's address book, which contained thousands of names, many representing peripheral or one-off acquaintances rather than core network participants. Due to the limited documentation, Pymont's precise connection remains unelucidated, consistent with numerous low-profile entries in the Black Book that have prompted ongoing scrutiny in Epstein-related inquiries.",

Similarly, Tafoya receives zero mentions across other documents in the archive, with the black book serving as the exclusive data source. No flight log entries, correspondence, or additional references provide insight into a timeframe of involvement, preventing any determination of when or how frequently contact may have occurred. Observable patterns from the data are correspondingly limited: Tafoya's isolation in the network statistics suggests minimal or no recorded overlap with Epstein's core associates, flight passengers, or documented participants in related events. Without further corroboration, such as public records or witness accounts linking Tafoya to Epstein's operations, his role cannot be characterized beyond this single, unexplained listing. This scarcity of information highlights the challenges in mapping Epstein's expansive contacts, where many names appear without context, potentially reflecting casual acquaintances, business leads, or other incidental ties. As an investigative archive, these details emphasize the need for caution in interpretation, distinguishing the verified black book entry from any inferred significance. Tafoya does not emerge as a publicly prominent figure in relation to Epstein's network based on the provided data.",

This listing, documented as the sole data source for Blaine's association, indicates that Blaine was among the high-profile names Epstein maintained contact information for, though no specific phone numbers, addresses, or additional details from the book are provided in available records.\n\nNetwork analysis reveals a peripheral position for Blaine within Epstein's documented circle: zero direct connections to other network figures, zero mentions across other Epstein-related documents such as flight logs or legal filings, and no evidence of frequent or substantive interaction. No timeframe for involvement can be determined, as the Black Book's compilation is generally dated to around 2004-2005 based on contextual court records, but Blaine's entry lacks timestamps or corroborating activity.\n\nObservable patterns from the data are limited due to the sparsity of information; the Black Book itself served as Epstein's address book for a vast array of celebrities, business leaders, and socialites, suggesting Blaine's inclusion reflects Epstein's strategy of cultivating relationships with entertainment industry notables, though no flights, meetings, or transactions link them directly. This minimal footprint underscores the challenges in mapping Epstein's network solely from contact lists, where presence does not imply active participation or complicity. Further public reporting on Blaine's career, including television specials and global performances, shows no overt professional overlap with Epstein's enterprises, and available sources yield no additional verifiable ties. Given the constrained data, Blaine's role remains that of a listed contact without deeper evidentiary involvement.",

He served as chairman and chief executive officer of Chase Manhattan Bank from 1969 to 1981, overseeing its expansion into a global financial powerhouse, and remained chairman of the executive committee until 1987. Rockefeller played a key role in international diplomacy and policy, co-founding the Trilateral Commission in 1973 and serving as chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1970 to 1985. His career emphasized cross-border economic cooperation, population control initiatives through the Rockefeller Foundation, and high-level networking among global elites.\n\nRockefeller's documented tie to Jeffrey Epstein is limited to a single entry in Epstein's personal \"Black Book,\" a contact directory seized during investigations into Epstein's activities.

This reflects the challenges of piecing together Epstein's web from fragmented sources, where black book inclusions often represent unelaborated associations rather than proven affiliations. Privacy considerations limit elaboration on non-public figures like Rosen absent additional substantiation.",
