## Notable Research Challenges

### Date Conflicts Identified
1. **Company Founding**: J. Epstein & Co. cited as both 1982 and 1988
2. **Prince Andrew Meeting**: Sources vary between "early 1990s" and 1999
3. **Sex Offender Registration**: July 2, 2008 (FDLE) vs July 22, 2009 (Sheriff)

**Resolution**: All conflicts documented in event descriptions with source attribution

### Information Gaps
1. **1990-2004 Activities**: Limited public documentation of this 14-year period
2. **Business Details**: Specific transactions and client relationships largely undocumented
3. **Daily Activities**: Flight logs end in 2002, leaving 17-year gap to 2019 arrest
4. **Full Associate List**: Only 150+ of potentially 1,000+ associates publicly named

### Verification Limitations
1. **Bloomberg Emails**: Analyzed but not publicly released (18,000 emails)
2. **Florida Grand Jury**: Sealed by court order (July 2025)
3. **Classified FBI Files**: Thousands of pages remain unreleased
4. **Private Island Records**: Logbooks referenced but not public

## Integration with Project Data

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Entity Timeline View**: Filter events by specific entity
2. **Interactive Timeline**: Web visualization with date slider
3. **Document Timeline**: Map released documents to investigation timeline
4. **Network Timeline**: Show relationship network evolution over time
