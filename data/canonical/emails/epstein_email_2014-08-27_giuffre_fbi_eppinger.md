## Email 1: Virginia Giuffre to Jason Richards

**To:** Richards, Jason R.
**Subject:** Hi There

G'day Jason,

I know I am a pain in your rear right now and I don't want to be but I am so close to wrapping up an era, just need a couple dates confirmed is all.

If you aren't sure about the dates which you have already said that's fine. I have turned the Wilton Manors police dept upside down looking through records and come up w nada. What was your acquaintance's name that took my statement about Ron Eppinger? Is it possible that it wasn't Wilton Manors and maybe it was somewhere else?

I'm really racking my brain about this!! It would be a personal favor to me and I am so very much appreciative of anything you might know!!

Thanks a lot mate!!

Hi Jenna,

My suggestion is for you to do a Freedom of Information Act request (www.foia.gov) for the information you are looking for because I am not able to release information (should there be any) from FBI records. You need to include as many details as possible so they can focus and narrow the search. Explain that you are looking for information related to your recovery as a victim of Ron Eppinger. The process may take some time but it is the appropriate method for you to obtain any possible records regarding your recovery. Hope this helps.

Best wishes,

Jason
