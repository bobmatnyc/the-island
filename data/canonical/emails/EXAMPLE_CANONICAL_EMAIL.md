# Notes
canonicalization_notes: |
  This email appears in three major collections with slight variations.
  The DocumentCloud version has the highest OCR quality and fewest artifacts.
  All three versions contain identical content - the email from State Attorney's
  office regarding a meeting with Epstein's attorneys on September 20, 2007.

  The Giuffre v. Maxwell version includes court exhibit markings (GX-412) but
  is otherwise identical. The House Oversight version has some OCR corruption
  in the email headers but body content is intact.

  Selected DocumentCloud 6506732 as canonical due to superior OCR quality.

# Email: Re: Meeting with Epstein's attorneys

**From:** StateAttorney@flsa15.gov
**To:** Assistant1@flsa15.gov, AssistantSAO@flsa15.gov
**CC:** ChiefLegal@flsa15.gov
**Date:** Thursday, September 20, 2007 3:45 PM

Hi team,

Just finished the meeting with Epstein's legal counsel (Lefkowitz, Dershowitz, and two associates). Here are the key points:

## Meeting Summary

1. **Plea Discussion**: They're pushing hard for a non-prosecution agreement. Main arguments:
   - Client has no prior criminal record
   - Willing to cooperate with ongoing investigations
   - Civil settlements already in progress with victims
   - Client's age and health considerations

2. **Proposed Terms**:
   - 18-month county jail sentence (work release)
   - Registration as sex offender
   - Restitution to identified victims
   - Mental health treatment program
   - No federal prosecution

3. **Evidence Discussion**:
   - They're aware of the flight logs and witness statements
   - Requesting to see victim interview transcripts
   - Claim some witnesses have credibility issues
   - Mentioned potential motions to suppress certain evidence

4. **Timeline**:
   - Want resolution before grand jury empanelment
   - Proposed meeting with US Attorney's office next week
   - Client willing to submit to polygraph

## Our Position

I held firm on the following:
- Any plea deal requires jail time (rejected probation-only proposals)
- Sex offender registration is non-negotiable
- Need to review all evidence before discussing specific terms
- Federal involvement is beyond our control

## Next Steps

1. Review proposed plea terms with Chief Deputy
2. Consult with victim advocates
3. Coordinate with FBI regarding federal investigation
4. Schedule follow-up meeting for October 5th

Let me know if you need any clarification on the above. This is going to be a high-profile case regardless of outcome.

Best,

[Signature redacted]
State Attorney's Office
15th Judicial Circuit of Florida
