# Motion to Unseal Documents - Giuffre v. Maxwell

**UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT**
**SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK**

---

**VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,**

Plaintiff,

v.

**GHISLAINE MAXWELL,**

Defendant.

---

**Case No.:** 1:15-cv-07433-LAP

**JUDGE:** Hon. Loretta A. Preska

**FILED:** December 18, 2023

## ORDER TO UNSEAL DOCUMENTS

The Court, having reviewed the submissions of the parties and interested non-parties, and having conducted an in camera review of the sealed materials, hereby ORDERS as follows:

### BACKGROUND

This case was filed on September 21, 2015, and settled on May 5, 2017. On August 9, 2018, the Miami Herald moved to intervene and unseal documents filed under seal. Following Jeffrey Epstein's arrest on July 6, 2019, and subsequent death on August 10, 2019, the Court ordered a comprehensive review of all sealed materials.

On August 23, 2019, the Second Circuit directed this Court to conduct a document-by-document review of the sealed materials to determine what should be unsealed. This Court has conducted that review.

### LEGAL STANDARD

The common law provides a general right of access to judicial documents. *Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga*, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006). The presumption of access may be overcome only by a showing of countervailing interests that "clearly outweigh" the public interest in access. *Id.* at 120.

The Court must balance:
1. The public's right to access court documents
2. Privacy interests of individuals named
3. Law enforcement interests
4. Fair trial concerns

### FINDINGS

The Court has reviewed submissions from 113 individuals referenced in the sealed documents. The Court finds:

1. **Public Interest**: There is substantial public interest in these materials given:
   - The nature of the allegations
   - The public profile of individuals involved
   - The significant media attention
   - Questions regarding the administration of justice

2. **Privacy Interests**: While privacy interests exist, they are diminished where:
   - Information is already public from other sources
   - Individuals were already publicly associated with Epstein
   - Information relates to conduct rather than private life
   - Individuals held positions of public trust

3. **Legal Objections**: Most objections to unsealing:
   - Assert generalized privacy concerns
   - Do not identify specific harm
   - Rely on information already in public domain
   - Are outweighed by public interest

### CATEGORIES OF UNSEALING

The Court divides the sealed materials into four categories:

#### Category 1: UNSEAL IMMEDIATELY
Documents containing:
- Information already public from other sources
- Testimony and statements from proceedings
- Communications already disclosed elsewhere
- Materials with strong public interest and minimal privacy concerns

#### Category 2: UNSEAL WITH REDACTIONS
Documents containing:
- Personal identifying information (addresses, phone numbers, SSNs)
- Information about minor children
- Medical or financial records not central to case
- Third-party information with legitimate privacy interests

#### Category 3: REMAIN SEALED
Limited materials containing:
- Ongoing law enforcement investigation details
- Information about cooperating witnesses
- Materials subject to grand jury secrecy rules
- Truly private information with no public interest

#### Category 4: DEFERRED
Materials requiring additional review or briefing

### INDIVIDUALS REFERENCED

The Court has reviewed objections from 113 individuals. Notable findings:

- **Does 1-50**: Most objections lack legal merit. Information largely public.
- **Does 51-75**: Some privacy interests recognized but outweighed.
- **Does 76-100**: Mixed findings, some sealed, some unsealed.
- **Does 101-113**: Primarily unsealed due to public interest.

### UNSEALING SCHEDULE

The Clerk of Court is directed to unseal documents according to the following schedule:

- **January 3, 2024**: Category 1 documents (Batch 1)
- **January 4-5, 2024**: Category 1 documents (Batches 2-6)
- **January 8-9, 2024**: Category 1 documents (Batches 7-8)
- **To be determined**: Category 2 documents (after redactions)

### SEALING RATIONALE REQUIRED

For materials remaining sealed, the Court finds:
1. Specific, substantial privacy interests exist
2. Interests clearly outweigh public access right
3. No less restrictive means available
4. Sealing narrowly tailored to privacy interest

### MEDIA ACCESS

The Court anticipates significant media interest and directs:
1. Documents to be posted on PACER immediately upon unsealing
2. Clerk to make documents available in public terminal
3. No preferential access for any media organization
4. Court will not provide summaries or compilations

### OBJECTIONS OVERRULED

The following objections are OVERRULED:
1. Generalized privacy claims without specific harm
2. Claims of reputational damage without privacy interest
3. Objections based on information already public
4. Claims of embarrassment or discomfort alone

### CONCLUSION

The Court finds that the public interest in access to these materials substantially outweighs the privacy interests asserted. The information contained in these documents relates to:
- Criminal conduct alleged in multiple jurisdictions
- Interactions with a convicted sex offender
- Questions about the administration of justice
- Matters of significant public concern

Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the motions to unseal and directs the Clerk to unseal the documents according to this Order.

**SO ORDERED.**
