di attached that to your July 21st letter, correct?
2 A. When we submitted the letter, as she had promised to do, we

4 Q. That was a fact that had come to light, correct?
Bi A. Yes, that's correct.
6 Q. She's telling the Court, we were not aware of them, clearly

9 A. I don't think that's what she meant to imply at all. I
10 think what she is saying is that we were going to submit a
11 letter and the plan was then to submit a letter laying it out,
12 which is what we did.
13 I don't believe Ms. Trzaskoma was trying to mislead
14 the Court. I think she was not as precise as she should have

23 that, correct?
24 A. I believe that it's true that our knowledge came after we
Vda received the letter. That's what the brief was intended to
