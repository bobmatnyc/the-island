eS 5
Since Ms. Maxwell’s own arrest in July 2020, the press attention has exploded. It
significantly dwarfs the media attention given to other recent high-profile defendants such
as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere.
As reflected in the graph below, in the 90-day period immediately following her arrest, Ms.
Maxwell was mentioned in more national media articles than in the analogous 90-day
periods for Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Cosby, Mr. Guzman Loera, and Mr. Raniere combined.
