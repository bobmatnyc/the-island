A staff member must observe all inmates confined in a continuous locked down status, such as nea
detention or disciplinary segregation, at least once in the first 30 minute period of the hour (example, 12:00
a.m. — 12:30 a.m.) followed by another round in the second 30 minutes period of the same hour (example,
12:30 am — 1:00 a.m.), thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per-hour. These rounds are to be
conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart. All observations must be
documented. (bila). (byT NC)
