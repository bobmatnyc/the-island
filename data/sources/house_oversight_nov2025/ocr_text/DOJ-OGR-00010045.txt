i A. There was no question that he did investigative work in the

3 But he did no work pertaining to Juror No. 1 until we received
4 the letter.

5 Q. Is it your claim that the Nardello firm's work was

6 identified in your brief?

7 A. I think so. I think what our brief says is we hired a

8 private investigator. It lays out the materials that we

9 gathered.

10 Q. You didn't see fit to tell Judge Pauley on the conference
11 call, by the way, we had this investigative firm?
1A A. Iwas involved. I really think it was in the brief. I

15 Schoeman and I were trying to respond to.
16 Q. The judge says he's trying to understand who was involved,
Xp He didn't say which jury consultants. He was trying to
18 understand who was involved. Natdello was involved, correct?

20 the question.
21 THE COURT: Sustained.
Za Q. You knew Nardello had done jury research, correct? It's a
23 very simple yes or no.
24 A. That is certainly so.
as Q. It's a very simple question.
