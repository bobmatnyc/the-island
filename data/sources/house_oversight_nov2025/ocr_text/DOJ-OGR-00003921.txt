Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Pursuant to the Court’s Opinion and Order, dated April 16, 2021 (Dkt. 207), we write to
inform the Court that the defense agrees that Ms. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the S1 superseding
indictment on the grounds that it was returned by a grand jury sitting at the White Plains
courthouse (Dkt. 125) is now moot in light of the fact that a grand jury sitting in Manhattan
returned the $2 superseding indictment.

— a Sincerely,

The motion to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment on

the grounds that it was returned by a grand jury sitting at

the White Plains courthouse (Dkt. No. 125) is DENIED /s/ Christian Everdell

as moot. SO ORDERED. Christian R. Everdell
