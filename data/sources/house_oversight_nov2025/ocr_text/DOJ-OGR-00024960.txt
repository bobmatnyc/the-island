It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we can

relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can pass along

to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone?

| understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the BOP

press release that was just put out | assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise.

Thank you.
