appeal concerns an unsealing order. Further, as the District Court correctly noted, Maxwell

“provide[s] no coherent explanation” connecting the discovery materials at issue in the criminal case

to the civil litigation.

CONCLUSION
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Defendant-Appellant Maxwell on appeal
and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED and the
motion to consolidate is DENIED as moot.
Any appeal in this criminal case shall be referred to another panel in the ordinary course.
