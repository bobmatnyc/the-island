1 The plaintiff has told me that they have now supplied
Z all the education and employment records that they have. I

3 think if there is any question about that, if the defense is

4 skeptical, I would ask the counsel for the plaintiffs to make
5 that statement on the record, not necessarily here, but by way
6 of a statement to the Court and principally to the defendant.

7 On the question of residences, that's, in my view, not
8 a contention interrogatory because of the nature of this case.
9 I think it's more like listing witnesses. So I would say that
ae) the plaintiff should supply all residences.

LE, The Dershowitz deposition will be produced under the
12 confidentiality provision. As I read what I've been given,

13 it's to be held in confidence and it will remain in confidence,
14 but it will be produced.

15 Yes, the tax returns should be produced. 15 years

16 seems like -- I see. Ok. 15 years.

cy The medical records of the period '99 to 2002 will be
1B produced and the plaintiff will indicate whether that

19 production is complete or, if it isn't complete, when it will
20 be complete.
il As for the pre-'99 medical records, based on where we
22. are at the moment, I do not believe that those are relevant.
23. Because the damage issue relates, in my view, solely to the
24 defamation. If that changes in any way, I will revisit that
25 issue.
