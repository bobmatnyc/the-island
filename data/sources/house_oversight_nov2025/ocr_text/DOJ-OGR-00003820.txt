1 things that happened prior to her time with them. Your Honor,
2 we do object to the production of that material.
3 THE COURT: The flashback allegation.
4 MS. McCAWLEY: I think what she may be referring to, I
5 have not heard that term used, I think what she may be
6 referring to was the fact that this is a defamation claim and
¥ the person who defamed my client was also an abuser, we allege.
8 So when she is defamed by the person who abused her and that
9 abuser is calling her a liar, that caused her significant
dS, emotional distress. It's different than if some other
vt individual that she had not had contact with called her a liar.
12 When she is talking about a flashback, maybe that's what she is
13 referring to, but we don't have the word flashback anywhere in
14 our complaint.
15 THE COURT: No. I made that up.
16 There will be no claim by the plaintiff that the
cy defamation caused her distress by making her aware or as a
18 result of the prior sexual abuse.
9 MS. McCAWLEY: The sexual abuse by the defendants?
Zk) THE COURT: No.
il MS. McCAWLEY: Sexual abuse by others.
Od THE COURT: Yes.
28 MS. McCAWLEY: No. Sexual abuse that relates to the
24 Epstein period, yes.
2D THE COURT: That I understand.
