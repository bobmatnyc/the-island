nue The filing of this nolle prosequi will dispose of
this case with respect to JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant.

2: On July 2, 2019, Indictment 19 Cr. 490 (the

' Indictment”) was returned, charging JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the
defendant, with one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking
of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and one count of sex
‘trhatficking of miners, in violation Of 18 U.S.C. § 1592.

3. On or about August 10, 2019, while the above-
captioned case was pending, but prior to any trial or other
disposition, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, died.

4, Because JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, died while
this case was pending, and therefore before a final judgment was
issued, the Indictment must be dismissed under the rule of
abatement. See United States v. Wright, 160 F.3d 905, 908 (2d Cir.

. 1998).
