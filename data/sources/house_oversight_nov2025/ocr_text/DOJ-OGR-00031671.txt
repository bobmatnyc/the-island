TO: Mr. Guy Lewis
RE: Mr. Epstein
FROM: Aileen Josephs, Esq.
Mr. Lewis:
Women in our County have been watching this case with great concern. I
strongly suggest you do not attack the victim(s). If you feel that your client has been
defamed, as you mentioned in the February 7, 2008 Palm Beach Post article, you can file
a libel suit- of course, the truth is an absolute defense to libel and please keep in mind
that not knowing the age of a child is no defense to statutory rape or any sexual crime
committed against a child.
Sincerely,
Aileen Josephs, Esq.
