full of 'vim and vigor’ and always just lovely to be with. she and I have seen our
relationship strengthen through shared common interests. In particular, Ghislaine's passion
for making a positive difference in the world, notably through her creation of the non-profit
TerraMar Project focusing on the protection of the world’s oceans, gave a

It is a joy to
be one of her best friends.
