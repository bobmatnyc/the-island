say that again) I can’t wait to buy some weed!!!. . . I also want to get a
vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because apparently there are ‘narcs’
everywhere”. [I also posted a photograph of a marijuana signature and
labeled it "what heaven looks like to me". This information and supporting
documentation was provided by the defense to the PBPD, was not included in

Attorneys Office, the defense was notified that a witness claimed that defense
investigators had impersonated police officers in an effort to get her statement.
The defense subsequently concluded that these accusations were made by I
(A reference to this accusation was included in the Police Report (at page 67)
and the probable cause affidavit). Defense counsel immediately questioned

investigators responded they were not “cops”. Despite having this

Report or probable cause affidavit, including only RE entastic, and false,
claims and that defense counsel was investigating the allegations.
