C2grdau2 Brune - direct

1 It's a simple question.

2 A. The standard under McDonough is actual knowledge. We

3 didn't know. I don't think it is material to the legal

4 analysis. That having been said, I think if had we to do it

5 over again, the equivalent of the July 21st letter should have
6 been submitted alongside the brief. I missed the issue of what
4 the government's position was going to be.

8 Q. You're familiar, are you not, Ms. Brune, with the cases

9 subsequent to McDonough that have held that full knowledge is
10 not required, that defense counsel has an obligation to bring
SEL potential misconduct to the Court's attention so that the court
LZ can deal with it, correct?

LZ A. I've certainly read a lot more of the waiver cases since

14 this whole issue has been joined. As an ethical matter,

Ls though, the standard is if the lawyer has actual knowledge of
16 juror misconduct. We did not have actual knowledge of juror

17 misconduct. Indeed, we believed, erroneously it now appears

18 for certain, there was no juror misconduct.

19 Q. I wasn't asking about the New York ethical rule that I
20 think you're referring to, Ms. Brune.
Zz A. I'm sorry, If you asked me about an ethical matter, that's
22 my understanding.
23 Q. I'll withdraw the question. You acknowledged in that July
24 22nd telephone call that you, your firm, or defendant Parse,
25 was differently situated than other defendants, correct?
