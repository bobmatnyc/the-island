Alberto, , 7 me
— received your short letter with-great disappointment. Unfortunately, today, I cannot . !
sccealh sony “resignation”. I’m sorry, but it is not that simple to abandon a “family member”, no
matter how frustrating or good-looking he may be. |
If my appreciation for both you and your talent has not been adequately expressed as you ‘&
and I have not spoken directly, I apologize. |
I am sure you have forgotten, but you had initially assvred me that the island project
would be done for /ast Christmas. I have always beén beth gracious and generous in forgiving *
the dates that have slipped by. You and I have, LU thoaght, a unique understanding.
Jean, who assured me the project would be complete dy the end of July, when in fact, for
example, till this day therg are still wooden packing crates for side tables in the living room, has 3
yet to contact me. Furpityure avag supposed to arrive, but even until today, I have not been told | .
what and when to expect the balance. r
Alberto, it is your right to take on only jobs you want. It is both unfair, unfriendly and
unprofesstoun! to gimpty leave a job undone in the middle. This is not your way. I don’t believe
that you would treat a sis friendly client with the same disregard. ;
I would hope that you will reconsider the big house Island project. As you know, we
have bought many things for the interior and have incurred great expense to get permits and
drawings in a Moroccan style, but if you choose not to move forward, I think at a minimum, my
. house should not be left in the state of disrepair in which it currently sits and should be brought
to completion as soon as possible. If Jean, who I have great respect for, does not want to :
| complete it as I believe he is only an employee and as I have my total relationship not with Jean, ; $ Be
but with Cabinet Pinto, the obligation falls on you personally. This is only right, you know it Tl i
As you are aware, I was told repeatedly that you would call me upon return from your vacation my,
and both visit and finish the project. You and I have more of a friendship than my receiving, in a
