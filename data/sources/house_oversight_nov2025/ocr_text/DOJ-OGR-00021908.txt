INTRODUCTION
1. On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL
THOMAS, the defendants, in dereliction of their duties as |
correctional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center |
(“MCC”), repeatedly failed to perform mandated counts of prisoners )
under their watch in the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”). |
Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS |
4
sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the
common area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their ,
duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications
attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in
. truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result
of those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU
were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, as
a result of the defendants’ conduct, no correctional officer
conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30
