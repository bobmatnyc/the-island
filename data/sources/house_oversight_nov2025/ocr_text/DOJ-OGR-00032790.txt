Hits From the BONG..
' ce ar Lyrics By: Cypress Hill
beer a Hits from the Bong
Hits from the Bong
Hits from the Bong
Hits from the Bong
Pick it
Pack it
Fire it up, come along
And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down
Just for a second
Don‘t get me wrong
It’s not a new method
Inhale
Exhale
Just got an ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my Double-Barrel Bong
Is gettin’ me stoned
I’m skill it
There's water inside don’t spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the Skunky, Phunky, Smelly Green Shit
Sing my song
Puff all night long
As I take hits from the Bong
Hits from the Bong y’all
Hits from the Bong
