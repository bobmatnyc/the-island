1 suggests that the agreements are privileged, as plaintiff

2 argues. She has refused to identify when these individuals

8 began their representations, the nature of the representations.
4 THE COURT: There is a little confusion here, at least
5 in my mind, as to what we are talking about. I certainly

6 understand the two gentlemen whose applications I have just

7 dealt with and the third person, who I take it is affiliated

8 with the Boies firm.

9 Obviously, over time the plaintiff has probably

dS conferred with other lawyers. But who cares? Let's assume she
it has talked to 20 more lawyers. You want all those retainers?
12 That doesn't make any sense. What is the universe we are

18 talking about?

14 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I certainly understand all
15 of the members of the Boies firm that currently represent her.
16 The third individual, if I understand correctly, is a gentleman
a by the name of Stan Pottinger. He is a lawyer of some renown.
1B He is also an author of best-selling books. He is listed quite
19 frequently on plaintiff's privilege log as being part and
20 parcel of advice being given to her on, quote/unquote, media
pa issues.
Od THE COURT: That is one.
28 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, there are other persons
24 listed on their privilege log. Many are listed as counsel for
25 plaintiff, but others are listed. Attorney giving advice to
