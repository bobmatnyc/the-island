determination that the Government’s case is strong.
IV. Conclusion
The defendant continues to represent a “plain[]” risk of flight. (Dec. Op. at 1). Even
assuming the Court has jurisdiction to grant this third bail motion, the two new bail conditions
offer insufficient protection against the “substantial and actual risk of flight” this Court has already
found that the defendant poses. (/d. at 21). The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.
Respectfully submitted,
