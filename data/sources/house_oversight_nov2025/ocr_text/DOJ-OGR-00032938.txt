NOTES /COMMENTS:; “is
Jeffrey,
Attached is a schedule comparing the valuc of the Managed Propertes as of 1/1/2002 anil
the estimated value as of 12/31/2004, inchiding the calculation of the Performance Fee.
Regarding your request for the value of the Exchaded Properties as of 1/1/2002, the E&'”
appraisal done in 2001 only inchided “Managed Properties”. Approximately 1,000 acres wes':
not inchided in the E & Y appraisal because they were identified before the appraisal 2:
Excluded Properties. In addition, a significant portion of the acres (approximately 100())
included in the appraisal were transferred to Excluded Properties before the Beginning Valu:
was finalized If you would like me to prepare an estimate the value of the Excindeii
Properties as of 1/1/2002 please let me know.
