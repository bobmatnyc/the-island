2 A. Now we're back to the conversation on Foley Square?

=| Q. I'm just asking a question, I'm not putting a date on it.

4 MR. SCHECTMAN: Judge, it would be helpful if we had a
5 date.

6 Q. I don't know the answer so I'm going to ask the broad

7 question.

8 A. Okay.

9 Q. At the time, around the time before the verdict came in --
10 A. Okay, that's helpful.

11 Q. Do you know whether Ms. Edelstein asked to see the

LA suspension opinion?

13 A. I don't think that she did, but I don't know one way or the
14 other. She certainly didn’t in the conversation on Foley
15 Square that we've been talking about,

16 Q. You do know, don't you, though, that on May 12th, Ms.

17 Trzaskoma told not the Court about the suspension issue but
18 Mr. Schoeman and Mr. Berke, correct?
me MR, SCHECTMAN; Judge, I object. I don't think the
20 date is accurate. I think it's leading. I mean, I don't
2h object to much leading, but the date's not accurate.
22 MS. DAVIS: Your Honor if I might, 611(c) allows us to
hes lead with a witness identified as an adverse party.
24 THE COURT: He's not objecting to leading. He's
25 objecting to leading with an erroneous assumption or statement
