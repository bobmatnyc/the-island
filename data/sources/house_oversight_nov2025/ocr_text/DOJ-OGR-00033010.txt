1 Ge You wrote that to your friend, didn't you? :
2 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Asked and :
3 answered, for the fourth time.
4 MR. TEIN: You are improperly objecting,
5 Mr. Leopold. You have no grounds to object. And |
| 6 that's not an objection. |
7 MR. LEOPOLD: It is an objection. :
8 MR. TEIN: Then terminate the deposition if |
9 you think it's been asked and answered.
10 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, I am not precluded
LL. from just making an objection to the form of the .
gj question. As the courts well know, and if you
13 practice here in West Palm Beach, many of the |
14 judges require you to set the objection with i
15 specificity. And I will do that. And if you
16 don't want me to, you can make the record. But I |
Ly? will do that. |
18 MR. TEIN: Here's what we'll do, Ted. You :
19 can -- I will allow you to reserve an objection to |
20 form for every single one of my questions.
zi Otherwise, all you're doing is obstructing.
2? MR. LEOPOLD: I won't do that. !
23 MR. TEIN: Of course; because you want to |
24 obstruct.
25 MR. LEOPOLD: All right.
