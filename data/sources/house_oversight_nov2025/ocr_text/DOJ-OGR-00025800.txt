Hi I'm not sure if you've already relocated but I'm hoping you can help or redirect me to
someone who can. | have a private investigator we have appointed under CJA coming to visit our client
from out of town next week Monday and Tuesday. What do we need to do to get him permission to
come in with us for a legal visit? Thank you.
