2. Legal Mail Packages:
Bureau of Prisons policy requires that incoming inmate property
packages be authorized in advance unless otherwise approved
under another Bureau policy. Packages containing only legal
material do not need to be pre-approved; however:

packages must be marked with words such as ‘Authorized

by Bureau Policy.’ This is to alert mail room staff

that enclosed materials contain matter which does not

require prior approval. .. . A package recelved

without an appropriately completed [authorization

form], or without markings indicating authorized

materials enclosed, is considered unauthorized and

Shall be returned to the sender.
PS 5800.10, Ch. 3, pp.8-S.
This additional marking, i.e., “Authorized by Bureau Policy,” is
only required on packages and should be in addition to the legal
mail markings explained above. Any legal mail that is delivered
in a box, a padded envelope or is wrapped in shipping paper is
considered a package and will be handied pursuant to the above
policy. An attorney who is unsure whether a iegal shipment will
be considered a package or an envelope should write “Authorized
by Bureau Policy” to ensure that the shipmert is not rejected.
(Note: An inmate who wishes to receive a non-legal material
package from anyone, including an attorney, must contact a
member of the Unit Team to complete the appropriate paperwork
and receive approval.)

3. FedEx:
Attorneys should not send packages via FedEx because no inmate
mall is received directly at MCC New York. Staff pick up all
inmate mail at the United States Post Office. FedEx will only
deliver to the actuai prison and staff are prohibited from
receiving a package for an inmate that is hand-delivered to MCC
New York. Attorneys who wish to expedite the delivery of
documents or materiais to their clients are advised to pass them
during a legal visit, place the materials in one of the
institution’s jlegal drop boxes or send the materials via the
Postal Service’s Express or Priority Mail services.

4, Stamps
Inmates may not receive stamps or stamped items other than
issuance from the institution or by purchase from the commissary.
28 C.F.R. §540.21(4). These items will be treated as contraband
