1 going to win. We're going to have a sentencing in January and

2 not a trial in the spring. But I don't think you can read that

3 much into it, and I don't think that in fairness to Mr, Parse

4 the record supports that. But I understand your Honor's views

5 of the matter. I can't say more.

6 THE COURT: Other than the alleged deficiencies by the

7 Brune firm regarding Juror No. 1, was Parse's counsel otherwise

8 constitutionally effective?

9 MR. SHECHTMAN: Look, I've never read a trial record
10 where I didn't say I wish they would have preserved that issue,
ibs I wish they would have made that argument, I think that
Lz cross-examination could have been stronger. I came away from
13 that trial thinking, boy, that Barry Berke is a great
14 cross-examiner.

15 If you asked me was it constitutionally adequate, you
16 bet. It was very solid defense by a group of very good
A} lawyers. So, that one's easy for me.
18 THE COURT: Can you think of any circumstance where a
19 Court could find both a waiver to an impartial jury and
20 effective assistance of counsel?
21 MR, SHECHTMAN; Yes. I think, The simplest one is if
22 it really was a strategic decision, take the most blatant case,
23 the lawyer said to themselves free bite at the apple, don't
24 tell the judge. If we get an acquittal the great thing about
25 the double jeopardy clause is it’s over. That is a waiver
