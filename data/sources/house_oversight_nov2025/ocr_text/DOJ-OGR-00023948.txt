With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last
night and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment
tomorrow. His attorney OOO as represented him in the past, and represents him in
connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the weekend. He went to MCC
today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but was just told he is not allowed in
because he is from out-of-state.

We’re concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment
(as we would be for any defendant) and so | wanted to reach out to you—is it at all possible to address
this issue so POC) | can meet with his client this evening? I’m available anytime at
(BOMo discuss, if that’s helpful, ° ae) can also be reached directly at if that’s
easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please just let me know afterward I’d be
grateful).

thanks very much,
