Questions & Proposed Responses:
Hello, I'm working ona story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges tee I've spoken to an AFGE union official and
The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues.
1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death?
eT
2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein’s suicide?
Anv chanaes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide?
4) Is it correct haf EITC) ere esponsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the niaht of the suicide?
(5) What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a person stays in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it's available.)
