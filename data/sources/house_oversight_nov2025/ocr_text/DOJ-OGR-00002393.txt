[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER
Upon a showing of good cause in support of the entry of a protective order to protect
the discovery and dissemination of confidential information, including sensitive personal
information relating to a victim of sexual abuse, copyright or trade secrets, commercially
sensitive information, or proprietary information.
Purposes And Limitations
The Parties acknowledge that this Order does not confer blanket protections on all
disclosures during discovery. Designations under this Order shall be made sparingly, with care,
and shall not be made absent a good faith belief that the designated material satisfies the criteria
set forth herein. If it comes to a Designating Party’s attention that designated material does not
qualify for protection at all, or does not qualify for the level of protection initially asserted, the
Designating Party must promptly notify all other parties that it is withdrawing or changing the
designation.
