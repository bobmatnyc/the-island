j A. Well, not necessarily all at once, but we certainly had
2 resources and I certainly did not ask that more be done
3 awaiting the answers from the prospective juror on voir dire.
4 Q. And you could have told the Court at that point, correct?
5 A. I certainly could have said to the Court that there is a
6 Google search out there that reveals that there's a suspended
a lawyer by the name of Catherine Conrad.
8 Q. And you didn't do that?
9 A. I did not do that.
10 Q. Now you appreciated, it sounds to me just from what you
44 said, pretty instantly, that this is potentially significant
12 information, correct?
13 A. If it's the same person, it's very significant information.
14 I certainly appreciated that.
LS Q, No one -= you didn't require anyone to have to explain that
16 to you, correct?
V7 A. No. I mean, we had a lot of Google-type information on a
18 lot of jurors and, you know, it's a big metropolitan area.
19 Some of that --
20 Q. Ms. Brune, I asked you a very specific question.
21 Ae, Can ==
22 Q. You did not require anybody else to explain to you the
Pfc Significance of that information. Is that true?
24 A. If that's your question, the answer is no, I did not ask
25 anyone to do any further research.
