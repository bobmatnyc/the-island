8 A. If it was the same person it was significant information,
3 that's correct.
10 Q. And you didn't need anyone to explain to you that it was
at potentially significant information?
12 A. No.
13 Q. And that it would be significant to Judge Pauley, correct?
14 A. I believe that it was certainly going to be significant to
15 Judge Pauley if it was the same person.
16 Q. And one way you find ovt if it's the same person is to ask
17 Judge Pauley to ask the potential juror, correct?
18 A. No. If the person has sworn under oath that her highest
13 level of education is college and has disclaimed any contact
20 with any disciplinary authority, I don't think that was the
21 reasonable course at all. What happened --
