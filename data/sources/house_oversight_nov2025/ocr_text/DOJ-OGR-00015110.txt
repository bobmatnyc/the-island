e The right to be heard at any public proceeding involving release, parole, or sentencing (§
3771 (a) (3);

e = The right to confer with the attorney for the Government (§ 3771 (a)(5)); and,

e The right to be treated with faimess and respect for dignity and privacy (§ 3771 (a)(8)).

See also Keuna v. U.S. Dist. Court, 435 F.3d 1011, 1016-17 (9th Cir. 2006) (fairness and dignity are
substantive, enforceable rights); Za re Dean, 527 F.3d 391, 394-95 (5th Cir. 2008) (government must
confer with victims before making consequential case decisions); Ju re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244 (11th
Cir. 2021) (en banc) (confirming that CVRA protections are fully attached post-conviction).
Crucially, the victims’ position regarding unsealing cannot be viewed m isolation as multiple
developments are occurring simultaneously:

e Maxwell’s New Platform and Public Legitimization: Despite being convicted on federal
sex trafficking charges, Maxwell has been given a public platform to speak with highly
influential individuals such as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, as though she
were a credible authority. That is particularly jarrmg given that she was charged with
multiple sex-trafficking offenses and two counts of perjury arising from civil depositions
on these very subjects. To be clear, we do not take issue with Mr. Blanche meeting with

; Ms. Maxwell, seemingly at Maxwell’s request, to obtain gratuitous information she wants
to provide. However, for survivors who bravely testified, the perception that Ms. Maxwell
is being legitimized in public discourse has already resulted in re-traumatization.

e Transfer to a Lower-Security Facility: Maxwell’s recent move to a lower-security prison
has further eroded the victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities. The
transfer was made without prior notice to the victims, without opportunity to object, and
without explanation—actions they see as extraordinarily msensitive and suggestive of
ulterior purposes.

e Lack of Consultation on Unsealing: The government sought the unsealing of grand jury
materials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a
step required by the CVRA and remforced by Doe v. United States, 08-80736 (S.D. Fla.).
That case, litigated pro bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose
precisely because the government previously violated the rights of many of these very
same victims. It is especially troubling that, despite the outcome of that litigation, the
government has once again proceeded in a mamner that disregards the victims’ rights—
suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken hold. This omission
reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the current
administration.

e Concrete Fear of Clemency: Survivors are acutely concerned that unsealing, coupled with
the transfer and Ms. Maxwell’s public platform, may be a prelude to clemency. The risk
of a pardon or commutation exacerbates safety concerns in derogation of § 3771 (a)(1),

; and threatens severe psychological harm, including triggering trauma responses. For
