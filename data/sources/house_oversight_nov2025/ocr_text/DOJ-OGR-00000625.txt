. Dear Warden N’ Diaye, |
Thank you for your letter of August 10, 2019 regarding the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. |
Epstein’s death is a tragedy to everyone involved in his case. |
One open question, among others, is whether the investigations referenced in your letter
will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epsiein on or about July 23, 2019. To my
knowledge, it has never been definitively explained whet the BOP concluded about that incident.
Sacerely, ry
