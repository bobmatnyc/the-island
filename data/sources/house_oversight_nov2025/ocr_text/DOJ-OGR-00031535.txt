Some people were beginning to complain about the heat. A good
sign. Beauty abounds.
| went to an early dinner over at Swifty’s with some old friends in from
out of town. The place was jammed on this early Monday night in New |
York.
At the table by the open windows was Lee Radziwill with friends. At
another table, Jim Kaufman was dining with Laura Codman, in from |
Texas on her way to London. Laura is directly descended from Ogden |
Codman, the gran-pappy of 20th century interior design. Ogden
Codman is now the god of interior design. Talk about influence, talk
about power in New York! Except he’s dead. Daid. And I'll bet at least
50% of the design community (sorry, but I'll bet I’m right) doesn’t have a
clue as to WHO Ogden Codman is/was. Or even his collaborator Edith
Wharton. That's okay, that’s show biz.
