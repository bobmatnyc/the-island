A couple of days ago,["""" fequested documents and | forwarded it to you in an e-mail] is
requesting a copy of the post orders (general orders) for suicide watch. He also asked for the sign-in sheets
for the suicide post orders for staff who were sitting on Epstein during his suicide watch. Do we have a copy
of this in the Lieutenant's office as well as the post orders? If there are not specific post orders, | think we
should get a copy of the quarterly post orders to demonstrate that the officers who sat on inmate Epstein
signed for the quarter."
Were these ever obtained by the Captain as | want to forward them. Thanks!
