Thank you.

Hi SEY |
Sounds good. I'll let the Court know about your facility placing the call to chambers. The number
for the Judge is (914) 390{9@9] If that changes, I’ll let you know.
Thanks for again your assistance with this.

It is easier for us to initiate the call here at MCC OREN will be ona phone that does not allow incoming
calls, so we prefer to call the court (or you) at the designated time and transfer the call down to him. Please
let us know if that is an issue. Assuming there's no problem with that, please let us know the appropriate
number to call at 11:00 AM on August 9.
Also, so you're aware, we make every effort to facilitate telephonic court appearances, but there may be
emergency circumstances that interfere. If we learn that we will not be able to facilitate the call for some
reason, we will let you know as soon as possible.
If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our office.
Thank you,
