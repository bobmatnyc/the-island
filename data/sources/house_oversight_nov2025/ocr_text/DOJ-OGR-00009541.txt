The Court approves the Defense's proposed redactions, which
are narrowly tailored to redact specific categories of questions
the Court may ask at the forthcoming hearing. Consistent with
this Court's prior order, such redactions help ensure the
integrity of the forthcoming hearing. See Dkt. No. 596. The
Court will docket the redacted Opinion & Order. As noted in
the prior order, the redactions will be promptly unsealed
following the hearing.
SO ORDERED.
