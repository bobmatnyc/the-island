Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we will be filing our Omnibus Memorandum
in Support of Ms. Maxwell’s Supplemental Pretrial Motions Relating to the S2 Superseding
Indictment with accompanying exhibits.

The memorandum and exhibits contain Confidential Information produced in discovery
that is governed by paragraph 15 of the Protective Order (Dkt. 36). Accordingly, pursuant to our
prior practice, we will not file the supplemental motions on the public docket until we are
instructed to do so by the Court. Instead, we will submit the supplemental motions by email to
the Court and the government under seal—pursuant to Rule 2(B) of the Court’s individual rules
of criminal practice—to give the government the opportunity to propose and justify any
redactions 1t deems necessary.

Please contact us with any questions. Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ Christian R. Everdell
