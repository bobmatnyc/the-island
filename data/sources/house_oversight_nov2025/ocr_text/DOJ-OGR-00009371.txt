C2grdau2 Brune - cross

1 would have been very distracting and would have not made her a
2 good juror, Second, I have a great deal of faith in our jury

3 consultant, and he told us that he did not think it was a good
4 idea to have a recovering alcoholic on the jury.

5 Third, the most important thing that any juror is

6 supposed to do is follow the judge's instructions. If I had

os known that a person was prepared to defy the Court by lying on
8 voir dire, I would never have had any confidence that the

9 person would follow the Court's instructions. So there's no

10 way that I wanted this person, if indeed she was a suspended

1 lawyer, to sit on this jury.

12 QO. Ms. Brune, would I be correct that your firm received Ms.
13 Conrad's letter to Mr. Okula approximately June 20th of 2011?
14 A. That's right. It was about three weeks after it was posted
15 to the government.

16 Q. At any time between the verdict in this case on May 24th

LY and the receipt of Ms. Conrad's letter on June 20th, had your
18 firm given any consideration to raising a juror misconduct

19 issue relating to Ms. Conrad as a basis for post-trial motions?
20 A. No.
21 Q. Why not?
22 A. I didn't think there had been juror misconduct.
23 Q. At any time during that same period did your firm give any
24 consideration to raising a juror misconduct issue as to Ms.
a! Conrad as an appellate issue?
