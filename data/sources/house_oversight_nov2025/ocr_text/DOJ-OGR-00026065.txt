Good morning,
In wake of the Epstein death, | understand that institutions across the bureau are designating specific
officers to regularly monitor surveillance video in segregated housing units and other locations where
inmates are at some risk for suicide.
Is there someone who may be able to elaborate on this effort?
Many thanks,
