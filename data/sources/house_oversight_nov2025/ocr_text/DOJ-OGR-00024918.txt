The Honorable Ron DeSantis
State of Florida
400 S. Monroe St.
Tallahassee, FL 32399-0001
Dear Governor DeSantis,
“For 48 years, I've dedicated my life to enforcing and upholding the law; as a patrol officer, detective,
chief of police and, since 2004, as the Sheriff of Palm Beach County.
My job now, as it has always been, is to not only maintain public safety but also the public’s trust.
Given the recent questions that have been raised around the Jeffrey Epstein case, | am formally
requesting that FOLE assume the existing criminal investigation and | pledge the cooperation and
participation of my agency. | believe the public interest would be best served by an FDLE-led
investigation examining every aspect of the Epstein case, from court sentencing to incarceration. My
agency will continue with the on-going internal affairs investigation.
As you know, Governor, I’m proud of this Department, and the men and women who devote their lives
every day to protecting others. Be rest assured as with any issue or concern that has crossed my desk
over the past 15 years A will strive for the truth, wherever that leads, to ensure justice is served and the
public trust in our layenforcement agency is maintained.”
Sincerely,
RieBradshaw, Sheriff
