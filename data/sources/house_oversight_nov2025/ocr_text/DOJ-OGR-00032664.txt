283 Ei It was, it was like, towards the middle and end of my school year.
29 But I remember that for the last like six or eight weeks of high
30 school, I didn’t have a car cause I gave it back to him. Because he,
31 he asked me to have sex with him and like, like suck him and stuff
32 [giggles], and I was just like, no. Definitely not. I was like, I’ll let
53 you touch me but I’m not gonna do that.
34
aS BE exo: This is 2005, right?
36
37 p Yeah, the car was a Dodge Neon 2005. He got it for me before the
38 New Year, because I remember I got it, it was an edition that was a
39 year before they were supposed to come out. So if I got it, I
40 obviously didn’t get a 2006 cause that’s this year. I got a 2005
41 Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it. That car was
42 awesome [giggles].

45
46 P| To and from school, just out with my friends.
