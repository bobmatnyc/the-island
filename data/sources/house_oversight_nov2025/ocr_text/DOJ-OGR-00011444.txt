Finally, Accuser-4 has widely publicized her account of being abused by Mr. Epstein, an
account that only very recently came to include Ms. Maxwell. Accuser-4 was first contacted by
the FBI in 2007. She was interviewed on August 7, 2007, by Special Agents Nesbitt Kuyrkendall
and Jason Richards and asked the alleged abuse. According to Accuser-4, during that interview,
she was recruited to perform sex acts with Mr. Epstein by Ms. Giuffre in the 2002-2003
timeframe. Accuser-4 did not identify Ms. Maxwell as someone who recruited her, groomed her,
or otherwise interacted with her in Palm Beach, Florida, or any other location. Accuser-4
identified Sarah Kellen as someone she interacted with and who took nude photographs of her at
Mr. Epstein’s direction. She advised the agents that she became pregnant in 2003 and moved to
Georgia.
