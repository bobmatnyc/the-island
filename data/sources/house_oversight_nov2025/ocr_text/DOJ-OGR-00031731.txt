Category: Goals, Plans, Hopes
So, I am officially a "college gal." The past two days
have been incredibly stressful. I've been so busy; all
I want to do is sleep. I moved into my dorm
yesterday but I still have alot of stuff to buy to make
it comfortable. My room is a suite, which is awesome. ;
There are only 4 suite buildings and I was lucky
enough to get one. I only have one roomate to deal
with and the room is a decent size so I can have
privacy too. I'm excited. Despite my excitement,
however, I am sad also. I don't know what's going
on,..... I miss Will,....1 guess he misses me, but who
knows,.... ::sigh:: I'm not used to falling asleep by
myself, I'm not used to him having pictures of naked
women on his wall. Everything's different. Maybe not,
