MACROSCOPIC EXAMINATION (PERFORMED BY" | WITH oN
ATTENDANCE, ON 8/20/2019): P
The unfixed brain weighs 1520g (expected, 1200-1500g). Examination of the fixed brain (minus
the left occipital pole, removed at the time of autopsy for possible toxicology) shows normal
leptomeninges. No contusions, stigmata of herniation, or other surface abnomnalities are seen.
External brainstem landmarks and cranial nerves are normal. Vessels at the base are distributed
normally, and have no atherosclerosis. The cerebellum is normal.
Coronal sections of the cerebral hemispheres reveal normal cortical ribbon, white matter, and deep
gray nuclei. There is no midline shift. Hippocampi are symmetrical and of normal volume.
Ventricles are normal in size and appearance.
Axial sections of the brainstem and cerebellum en bioc show the substantia nigra and locus
ceruleus to be well-pigmented. The aqueduct and fourth ventricle are normal. Cerebellar cortex,
white matter, and dentate are normal.
Cranial dura from the convexities, tentorium, and base shows falcine ossification (comment
common age-related finding}. The venous sinuses and tributary (bridging} veins are patent.
Spinal cord and dura from upper cervical! to cauda equina levels show no abnormality, externally
or on midsagittal section.
