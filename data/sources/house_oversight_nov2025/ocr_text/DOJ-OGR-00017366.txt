1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: I'll note I received a report from the

3 district executive office that, once again, today, everyone

4 who's appearing to watch the trial is being accommodated,

5 either in this court or in the overflow courtrooms. There are
6 empty seats available for everybody who wishes to observe the
7 public trial.

8 With that, anything else before we wait for the

9 jurors?

10 MS. COMEY: No, thank you, your Honor.

11 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.
