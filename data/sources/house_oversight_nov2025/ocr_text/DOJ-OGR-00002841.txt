Jatter point, it is undisputed that the alternate mailing address defect actually led to an increase of
representation of the very minority groups that Schulte contends were underrepresented, (Gov’t _
Opp. Br. at 17.) Thus empiricism precludes the notion that the violation was “substantial” in
nature. LaChance, 788 F.2d at 870 (explaining that the inquiry for whether a violation is |
substantial is the “extent of its effect on the wheels”); see also Allen, 2021 WL 431458, at *11 |

Court concludes that Schulte has not demonstrated a plausible violation of the JSSA. |
CONCLUSION :
For the forgoing reasons, the motion to dismiss is DENIED. |
