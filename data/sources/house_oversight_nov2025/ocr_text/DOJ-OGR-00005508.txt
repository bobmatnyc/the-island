Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 382 Filed 10/29/21 Page 53 of 69
government has provided "notice" tha ae :: a "victim" in this case, and has disclosed
a number of exhibits related to her — school records (GX 781-783); employment records (GX
821-22), photo (GX 332).?’ It is apparent that the government hopes to prove tha i
was a "victim" in the sense that she was underage when she had sex with Jeffrey Epstein, without
calling her as a witness in this case. Again, if the government offers evidence that the sexual
contact observed by ay between AE nd Mr. Epstein amounts to "sexual
abuse" because J was underage, then such testimony would open the door to the
mountains of evidence that tends to impeach that assertion.

Given the failure to specify the statements that will be elicited, the purposes for which
those statements qualify as non-hearsay, depriving the defense of an opportunity to brief whether
such statements open the door to credibility challenges of the accuser-declarants}illlland
HE. this Court should deny the motion.
27 Tellingly, the government failed to provide an exhibit for SE birth certificate, but did for yy
ME. See GX 11-15.
