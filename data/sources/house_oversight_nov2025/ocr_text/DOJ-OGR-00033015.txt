12 professional manner, and ask the question and once
13 you get the answer, to either follow up on it or
14 move on, but not continuously browbeat and ask the
15 same question over and over because you don't like
16 the answer.
rig MR. TEIN: Calm down, sir.
18 MR. LEOPOLD: Trust me, I'm very calm here.

21 allow you to continue to harass her in the
oe, demeanor that you're doing. Ask her a question ;
23 and move on.
