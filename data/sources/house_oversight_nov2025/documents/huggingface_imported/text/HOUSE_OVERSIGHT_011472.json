  "text": "﻿Night Flight\nThey say that you can read a person’s feelings on his face. But if so, either\nI’m a very good actor – the opposite of what anyone who has worked closely\nwith me would tell you – or the journalists clustered in front of me weren’t very\ngood face-readers. They said that I looked defeated. Distressed. Depressed.\nYet as I delivered my brief final statement outside an olive-green cabin at\nCamp David, the American presidential retreat in the forested Catoctin hills\nnorth of Washington, I felt none of those things.\nYes, I was disappointed. I realised that what had happened over the last 14\ndays, or more crucially what had not happened, was bound to have serious\nconsequences, both for me personally, as Prime Minister of Israel, and for my\ncountry.\nBut I had been a politician, at that point, for all of five years. By far most of\nmy life, I had spent in uniform. As a teenager, small and slight and not even\nshaving yet, I was one of the founding core of a unit called Sayeret Matkal,\nIsrael’s equivalent of America’s Delta Force, or Britain’s SAS. It may be that\nthe way I thought and acted, the way I dealt with danger or with crises, came\nfrom someplace inside me. Even as a young kid, I was always quiet, serious,\ncontemplative. But my 13 years as a part of Israel’s main special-forces unit,\nespecially once I became its commander, etched those qualities more deeply.\nAnd they added new ones: a sense that you could never plan a mission too\ncarefully or prepare too assiduously; an understanding that what you thought,\nand certainly what you said, mattered a lot less than what you did. And above\nall the realisation that, when one of our nighttime commando operations was\nover, whether it had succeeded or failed, you had to take a step back. Evaluate\nthings accurately, coolly, without illusions. Then, in the light of how the\nsituation had changed, you had to decide how best to move forward.\nThat approach, to the occasional frustration of the politicians and diplomats\nworking alongside me during this critical stage of Israel’s history, had guided\nme from the moment I became Prime Minister. In my very first discussions with\nPresident Clinton a year earlier – a long weekend, beginning at the White House\nand moving on to Camp David – I had mapped out at great length, in great\ndetail, every one of the steps I knew we would have to take to confront the\ncentral issue facing Israel: the need for peace.\n1\nIn choosing to return, now, to Camp David for two weeks of summit talks, I\nknew the risks. Of all the moments of truth in my life – and in the life of my\ncountry – few, if any, would carry higher stakes. Success would mean not just\none more stutter-step away from our century-long conflict with the Palestinians.\nIt would signal a real, final peace: in treaty-speak, end of conflict. Whatever the\ncomplexities of putting an agreement into practice, given all the suffering and\nbloodshed endured by both sides, we would have crossed a point of no return.\nThere would be two states, for two peoples.\nAnd if we failed? I knew, if only from months of increasingly stark\nintelligence reports, that an explosion of Palestinian violence – not just with\nstones or bottles this time, but with guns and explosives – would be only a\nmatter of time.\nI knew something else as well. This would be a moment of truth not just for\nme. Or for Bill Clinton, a man who understood our conflict more deeply, and\nwas more determined to help us end it, than any other president before him. It\nwas a moment of truth for the leader of the Palestinians, Yasir Arafat.\nThe Oslo Accords of 1993, groundbreaking though they were, had created a\npeace process, not peace. Over the past few years, that process had been\nlurching from crisis to crisis. Political support for negotiations was fraying. And\nyet the core issues of our conflict had not been resolved. In fact, they had hardly\nbeen talked about. The reason for this was no secret. For both sides, these\nquestions lay at the heart of everything we’d been saying for years, to the world\nand to ourselves, about the roots of the conflict and the minimum terms we\ncould accept in order to end it. At issue were rival claims on security, final\nborders, Israeli settlements, Palestinian refugees, and the future of ancient city\nof Jerusalem. None of these could be resolved without painful, and politically\nperilous, compromises.\nEntering the summit, despite the pressures ahead, I was confident that I, with\nmy team of aides and negotiators, would do our part to make such a final peace\nagreement possible. Nor did I doubt that President Clinton, whom I had come to\nview not just as a diplomatic partner but a friend, would rise to the occasion.\nBut as for Arafat? There was simply no way of knowing.\nThat was why I had pressed President Clinton so hard to convene the\nsummit. That was why, despite the misgivings of some of his closest advisers,\nhe had taken the plunge. We both knew that the so-called “final-status issues” –\n2\nthe substance of any real peace – could not simply be put off forever.\nUntangling them was getting harder, not easier. And we realised that only in an\nenvironment like Camp David – a “pressure cooker” was how I described it to\nClinton, and to US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright – would we ever\ndiscover whether a peace deal could in fact be done.\nNow, we knew.\n* * *\nIsrael’s equivalent of Air Force One, perhaps in a nod to our country’s\npioneering early years, was an almost prehistoric Boeing 707. It was waiting on\nthe runway at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington to ferry me and the\nrest of our negotiating team back home.\nIt contained a low-rent equivalent of the American version’s presidential\ncabin, and a few 1960s-vintage first-class seats, but consisted mostly of two\nlong lines of coach seats, three abreast, separated by an almost tightrope-narrow\naisle. I dare say I was alone in finding an odd sense of comfort in boarding the\nplane. This museum piece of an aircraft was part of my past. It was the same\nmodel of 707 for which I, with a couple of other young soldiers and engineers,\nhad come up with what we dubbed the “submarine door” system outside the\ncockpit – to protect El Al pilots from future attacks after one of its planes had\nbeen hijacked to Algiers in the summer of 1968. It was also the same kind of\nplane – a Sabena flight, hijacked to Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion Airport – which I\nstormed, before sunrise, four years later with a force of nearly two dozen\nMatkal commandos. The shooting was over within 90 seconds. One of my men\n– a junior officer named Bibi Netanyahu – was wounded. By one of our own\nbullets. But we managed to kill two of the heavily armed hijackers, capture the\nothers, and free all 90 passengers unharmed.\nStill, even I had to accept, it was no fun to fly on.\nAs we banked eastward after takeoff and headed out over the Atlantic, the\nmood on board was sober. Huddling with the inner core of my negotiating team\n– my policy co-ordinator Gilad Sher, security aide Danny Yatom and Foreign\nMinister Shlomo Ben-Ami – I could see that the way the summit ended had hit\nthem hard. It was probably true, as all three often reminded me, that the greatest\npressure fell on me. I was the one who ultimately decided what we could, or\n3\nshould, offer in search of a true peace with the Palestinians. I was the one who\nwould be blamed by the inevitable critics, whether for going too far or not far\nenough, or simply for the fact the deal had eluded us. I knew the drill: the same\nthing had happened when I had come tantalizingly close to finalizing a peace\ndeal with Syria’s then-dying dictator, Hafez al-Assad, a few months earlier. Yet\nthese three dedicated men – Gili, who was by training a lawyer; Shlomo, an\nacademic; and Danny, a former Mossad chief – had just been through dozens of\nhours of intricately detailed talks with each of Arafat’s top negotiators at Camp\nDavid, not to mention the dozens of other meetings before we had even got\nthere. Now they had to accept that, even with the lid of the pressure cooker\nbolted down tight, we had fallen short of getting the peace agreement which\neach of us knew had been within touching distance.\nI don’t think that even they could be described as depressed. On our side,\nafter all, we knew we had given ground on every issue we possibly could,\nwithout facing full-scale political rebellion at home. We had proposed an Israeli\npullout from nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza. A support mechanism for\nhelping compensate tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees from the serial\nArab-Israeli conflicts of the past half-century. And most painfully and\ncontroversially – my rivals and critics back home were already accusing me of\n“treachery” – we had agreed to let President Clinton present a proposal for the\nPalestinians to get sovereignty over the Arab neighbourhoods of Jerusalem as\nwell as “custodial sovereignty” over the Haram al-Sharif, the mosque complex\nperched above the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism.\nBut precisely because we had been ready to offer so much, only for Arafat to\nreject it all, even as a basis for talks on a final deal, I could sense how gutted my\nkey negotiators were feeling.\nStill, I’m sure none of them was surprised when my own old operational\ninstincts kicked in. In my statement to journalists, I had been careful to say that\nArafat was not ready at this time to make the historic compromises needed for\npeace. But before parting with President Clinton and Secretary Albright, I’d\nbeen more forthright. It was clear, without my saying so, that the chances of our\ngetting a peace agreement on Clinton’s watch were now pretty much over. He\nhad barely five months left in office. Yet my deeper fear was that with Arafat\nhaving brushed aside an offer that went far further than any other Israeli had\nproposed – far further than the Americans, themselves, had expected from Israel\n– the prospects for peace would be set back for years. Perhaps, I said, for two\ndecades.\n4\nThe challenge now, I told my exhausted team, was to make sure we were\nprepared for this new reality. Part of the spadework was already in place. Much\nas I’d hoped that Arafat and I could turn a new page in Middle East history, I\nhad directed our army chief-of-staff, nine months before the summit, to draw up\ncontingency plans for the likelihood of an unprecedentedly deadly eruption of\nPalestinian violence if we were to fail.\nNow, I felt we had to go even further, and to prepare a proactive alternative\nto the negotiated deal we’d been unable to secure. I proposed considering a\nunilateral Israeli pullout from the West Bank and Gaza. The territorial terms\nwould, necessarily, be less far-reaching than the proposal Arafat had rejected.\nBut I felt we should still withdraw from the great majority of the land we had\ncaptured in 1967, still leaving the Palestinians an area which the outside world\nwould recognize as wholly sufficient for them to establish a viable, successful\nstate.\nAnd crucially, this would finally give Israel, our country, a delineated, final\nborder with the territory captured in the Six-Day War.\nGili, clearly uneasy about accepting the idea that the chances for a negotiated\npeace were definitively gone, left to try to get some sleep on the long flight\nahead. Danny and Shlomo Ben-Ami as well. Within an hour or so, the plane\nwas full of irregularly slumped bodies, the silence broken only by the drone of\nthe 707’s engines and the occasional sound of snoring.\nI sat, wide awake, in one of the seats at the front.\nMy sleeping habits were another inheritance from Sayeret Matkal. During\nthose years, nearly everything of significance which I did had happened after\nsundown. The commando operations were, of course, set for darkness whenever\npossible. The element of surprise could mean the difference between success\nand failure, indeed life and death. But all of my planning, all my thinking,\ntended to happen at night as well. The quiet, and the lack of distractions, helped\nto discipline my mind. I found that it helped to free my mind as well, sometimes\nonly to discover that it went off in unexpected directions.\nIt did so now. Perhaps even I was still reluctant to accept that Camp David\nmeant that the opportunity for a transformative deal with Arafat was finished.\nYet whatever the reason, I began thinking back to the first time that my path and\nhis had crossed. It was in the spring of 1968, nearly a year after Israel had\ndefeated the armies of our three main Arab enemies – Egypt, Syria and Jordan.\nIsraeli forces were advancing on a Jordanian town called Karameh, across the\n5\nJordan River from the West Bank, from which a fledgling group called Fatah,\nunder the command of Arafat, had been staging a series of raids. In one of their\nmost recent attacks, they’d planted land mines, one of which destroyed an\nIsraeli schoolbus, killing the driver and one of the teachers and injuring nearly a\ndozen children. The so-called Battle of Karameh was our single most significant\noperation since the 1967 war. In pure military terms, it succeeded. But at a\nprice: more than two dozen Israeli soldiers dead. It also had a major political\nimpact. It caused shock among many Israelis, still wrapped in a sense of\ninvincibility from the Six-Day War, as well as a feeling in the Arab world,\nactively encouraged by Arafat and his comrades, that compared to the great\narmies Israel had defeated in 1967, Fatah had at least shown fight. Fatah had\ndrawn blood.\nI had just turned 26 years old. I was finishing my studies in math, physics\nand economics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and had joined my\nSayeret Matkal comrades the night before the assault. It was a huge operation:\nten battalions, including crack infantry units. Our own role was relatively minor.\nWe were to seal the southern entrance to the town. But it proved a tough slog\njust to get there. Our vehicles got bogged down in mud. By the time we arrived,\nFatah fighters, although many were in civilian clothes so we couldn’t be sure,\nwere racing past us in the other direction. One of them, we were later told, was\nYasir Arafat. On a motorcycle.\nIt would be nearly three decades before the two of us actually met – shortly\nafter the assassination of my longtime comrade and friend Yitzhak Rabin, when\nI had become Foreign Minister under Shimon Peres. But in the intervening\nyears, Arafat was rarely off of my radar. By the early 1970s, he and his fighters\nhad been expelled by King Hussein’s army from Jordan and were re-based in\nLebanon. Arafat was becoming a significant figure on the Arab and world\npolitical stage, and an increasingly uncomfortable thorn in Israel’s side. I was\nhead of Sayeret Matkal by then. Over a period of months, I drew up a carefully\nconstructed plan – a raid by helicopter into a Fatah-dominated area in\nsoutheastern Lebanon, during one of Arafat’s intermittent, morale-boosting\nvisits from Beirut – to assassinate him. My immediate superior, the army’s head\nof operations, was all for our doing it. But the chief of military intelligence said\nno. Arafat, he insisted when we met to discuss the plan, was no longer the lean,\nmean fighter we had encountered in Karameh. “He’s fat. He’s a politician. He is\nnot a target.”\n6\nA decade later, the idea would suddenly resurface. In my first meeting, as a\nnewly promoted Major General, with our then Defence Minister Ariel Sharon,\nSharon turned to me and the army’s Chief of Staff, Rafael Eitan, and said: “Tell\nme. Why the hell is Arafat still alive?” He looked first at Raful, then at me, and\nadded: “When I was 20 years younger than you are, I never waited for someone\nlike Ben-Gurion or Dayan to ask me to plan an operation. I would plan it! Then\nI’d take it to them and say, you’re the politicians, you decide, but if you say yes,\nwe’ll do it.” I smiled, telling him that I’d done exactly that, a decade earlier,\nonly to have one of his mates in the top brass say no. Sharon now said yes. But\nthe plan was overtaken: by his ill-fated plan to launch a full-scale invasion of\nLebanon in 1982, targeting not just Arafat, but with the aim of crushing the\nPLO militarily once and for all.\nI finally met Arafat face-to-face at the end of 1995. Although the Oslo peace\nprocess had dramatically changed things, it was clear that the real prize – real\npeace – was still far away. We were in Barcelona, for a Euro-Mediterranean\nmeeting under the auspices of King Juan Carlos, aimed at trying to re-invigorate\nnegotiations. The ceremonial centrepiece of the event was a dinner at one of the\nroyal palaces, and it was arranged for me and Arafat to meet for a few minutes\nbeforehand. I arrived first. I found myself in a breathtakingly opulent, but\notherwise empty, room. Empty, that is, except for a dark-brown Steinway piano.\nFrom childhood, I have loved music. And while I am never likely to threaten the\ncareer of anyone in the New York Philharmonic, I have, over the years,\ndeveloped some ability, and drawn huge enjoyment, as a classical pianist. I\npulled back the red-velvet bench and began to play. With my back to the\ndoorway, I was unaware that Arafat had arrived, and that he was soon standing\nonly a few feet away, watching as I played one of my favourite pieces, a Chopin\nwaltz. My old commando antennae must have been blunted. I may not have\nbecome “fat”. But, undeniably, I was now a politician.\nWhen I finally realised Arafat was behind me, I turned, embarrassed, stood\nup, and grasped his hand. “It’s a real pleasure to meet you,” I said. “I must say I\nhave spent many years watching you – by other means.” He smiled. We stood\ntalking for about 10 minutes. My hope was to establish simple, human contact;\nto signal respect; to begin to create the conditions not to try to kill Arafat, but to\nmake peace with him. “We carry a great responsibility,” I said. “Both of our\npeoples have paid a heavy price, and the time has come to find a way to solve\nthis.”\n7\nI sensed, at the time, at least the start of some connection. I suspected that\nArafat viewed me, as he had Rabin before me, as a “fellow fighter”. But if so, I\nnow wondered whether that might have been part of the problem in his ever\ntruly understanding my mission at Camp David. My motivations. Or my mind.\nEven in Israel, my reputation as a soldier has sometimes been as much a\nburden as an advantage. A whole body of stories has followed me from my 36\nyears in uniform – a career which, after Sayeret Matkal, led me up the military\nladder until I was head of operations, intelligence, and eventually of the entire\narmy as Chief of Staff. By the time I left the military, I was the single most\ndecorated soldier in our country’s history. Some of the stories were actually\ntrue: that when we burst onto the hijacked Sabena airliner, for instance, we were\ndressed as a maintenance crew; or that, in leading an assassination raid in Beirut\nagainst the PLO group that had murdered Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich\nOlympics, I was disguised as a woman. Not the most attractive young lady,\nperhaps, though I did, painfully, pluck my eyelashes, and, with the help of four\npairs of standard-issue Israeli Army socks, develop quite a comely bosom. I\nrejected the idea of wearing a long dress, in favour of stylishly flared trousers. I\nwas going on a commando operation, after all, not a prom date. But I did wear\nheels. So yes, a woman, of sorts.\nYet some of the stories were just plain myth. I had given up counting the\ntimes I’d heard about my alleged prowess in recording the fastest-ever time on\nthe most gruelling of the Israeli army’s obstacle courses. In fact, I was a lot\nmore like Goldie Hawn in Private Benjamin.\nThe main misunderstanding, however, went deeper. The assumption\nappeared to be that my military achievements, especially in Sayeret Matkal,\nwere down to a mix of brute force and raw courage. Courage, of course, was a\nrequirement: the willingness to take risks, if the rewards for success, or the costs\nof inaction, were great enough. Few of the operations I fought in or commanded\nwere without the real danger of not coming back alive. But whatever success I’d\nhad as a soldier, particularly in Matkal, was not only, nor even mainly, about\nbiceps. It was about brains. The ability to make decisions. To withstand the\npressure of often having to make the most crucial decisions within a matter of\nseconds. It was, above all, about thinking and analyzing – and always, always,\nlooking and planning ahead.\nAnd as our plane droned onward towards Israel, I knew that I would now\nneed all of those qualities more than ever.\n8\n* * *\nThis book is only in part the story of my life – a life that, from my\nbeginnings as a kibbutz boy in pre-state Palestine, has been intimately entwined\nwith the infancy and adolescence and, now, the increasingly troubled middle\nage of the State of Israel.\nStill less is it only a record of its, or my, achievements, although they are\ninevitably a part of the story.\nIn setting out to write it, I was also determined to document, from the inside,\nthe critical setbacks as well. Mistakes. Misjudgements. Missed opportunities.\nAnd the lessons that we can, and must, be prepared to learn from them.\nNo less so than I when I was planning a hijack rescue or a cross-border\ncommando operation in Sayeret Matkal, I remain convinced that Israel’s\nsecurity, Israel’s very identity, can be safeguarded only by evaluating\ndispassionately the situation in our country and the world. And by looking\nahead.\nEven when I was a soldier, I never stopped thinking this way, especially\nwhen, first as military intelligence chief and especially as Chief of Staff, I knew,\nin detail, every one of the security threats that faced Israel and was part of\ndiscussions and decisions to try to confront them. I still vividly remember as\nChief of Staff, every Friday before the arrival of the Jewish Sabbath, sitting\nwith Rabin, who was then Israel’s Defence Minister. Our offices were along the\nsame hallway of the kirya, the ministry’s headquarters in the heart of Tel Aviv.\nRabin had a very low table in his office, with two chairs. We would sit across\nfrom each other, each with a ready supply of coffee and Yitzhak smoking an\napparently endless supply of cigarettes, and we would just talk. Politics.\nStrategy. Israel. The PLO. The surrounding Arab states. And the wider world.\nMany years before I became Prime Minister, I gave a lecture at a memorial\nmeeting for an Israeli academic. Not many people were there. I doubt even they\nremember it. But I do, because what I said has, sadly, become more prophetic\nthan even I could have imagined. I talked about the imperative for peace as part\nof Israel’s security. There was a “window,” I said. We were militarily strong. In\nregional terms, we were a superpower. But politically, resolving the conflict\nwith our Arab enemies would almost certainly become more difficult with time.\n9\nIraq, perhaps Iran and other Middle Eastern states, might get nuclear weapons.\nA violent form of fundamentalist Islam could, over time, erode existing Arab\nand Muslim states, threatening Israel of course, but also the stability of our\nneighbourhood and of the world. In those circumstances, even if an Israeli\ngovernment was strong enough, wise enough, forward-looking enough to\npursue avenues for negotiated peace with its immediate neighbours, getting the\npopular support required would be all but impossible.\nThe window is still there. But it is only barely open.\nI fear that I was right, as well, in predicting that our failure to secure a final\npeace agreement with the Palestinians at Camp David might set back\npeacemaking not just for a few months, but for many years. I have persisted in\ntrying, very hard, to make that particular prediction prove wrong. That was why,\ndespite intense pressure from my own political allies not to do so, I decided to\nreturn to government in 2007 as Defence Minister. I remained in that role for\nsix years: mostly in the current, right-wing Likud government of my onetime\nSayeret Matkal charge, Bibi Netanyahu.\nMuch of what I say in this book about war and peace, security and Israel’s\nfuture challenges, will make uncomfortable reading for Bibi. But very little of it\nwill surprise him, or his own Likud rivals further to the right, like Foreign\nMinister Avigdor Lieberman and the Economy Minister, Naftali Bennett. I have\nsaid almost all of it to them behind closed doors in the past few years, more than\nonce. When I finally decided to leave the political arena last year, it was largely\nbecause I realized that they were guided by other imperatives. In the case of\nBibi, the most gifted politician with whom I’ve worked except for Clinton, the\npriority was to stay in power. For Avigdor and Naftali, it was to supplant Bibi,\nwhen the opportunity was ripe, as Likud leader and as Prime Minister. And\nmuch too often – as with their hugely ill-advised recent proposal to amend\nIsrael’s basic law to define it explicitly as a Jewish state, and deny “national\nrights” to non-Jews – the three of them have ended up competing for party\npolitical points rather than weighing the serious future implications for the\ncountry.\nPeacemaking, as I discovered first-hand, requires taking risks. Statesmanship\nrequires risks. Politics, especially if defined simply as staying in power, is\nalmost always about the avoidance of risk.\n10\nThe problem for Israel, no matter who or what party is in government, is that\nthere are risks everywhere one looks, and they show every sign of getting more,\nnot less, serious.\nThe “Arab Spring” has morphed into an Islamic winter. National frontiers\nthat were put in place by British and French diplomats after the fall of the\nOttoman Empire are vanishing. Centuries-old conflicts between tribes and rival\nreligious communities have reignited. The old Cold War system of nations has\ngiven way to a world without a single geopolitical centre of gravity. Perhaps\nmost seriously, Iran seems determined to get nuclear weapons, and, in my view,\nmay succeed in doing so.\nWhere Israel is concerned, relations with our indisputably most important\nally, the United States, are more strained than at any time in decades.\nDiplomatic ties with Europe, our single largest trading partner, have been\ngrowing steadily worse. And the only real certainty is that anyone who tells you\nthat they know absolutely where things are heading next is lying. Just ask Hosni\nMubarak, who, despite having nearly half-a-million soldiers and security\noperatives at his disposal, was utterly blindsided, and very soon toppled and\nimprisoned, by an uprising that began with a sudden show of popular anger in\nCairo’s Tahrir Square.\nInternally as well, Israel faces dangers. Chief among them is the alarming\nerosion of the standards of civil discourse, amid the increasingly shrill, often\nhateful, divisions between left and right, secular and religious, rich and poor\nand, most seriously of all, Jews and Arabs. While we remain economically\nsuccessful, the fruits of our wealth are being ever more unevenly shared, and the\nprospects for continued growth constrained by the lack of any visible prospect\nof long-term peace.\nBibi Netanyahu, of course, knows all of this. Indeed, he has repeatedly\nspoken of the multiple threats Israel faces, not only in somber terms, but at\ntimes almost apocalyptically.\nThat works, politically. Politicians, not just in Israel but everywhere, know\nthat it is a lot easier to win elections on fear than on hope.\nYet my own prescription – learned, as this book recounts, from years on the\nbattlefield, then reinforced by my years in government – is that Israel must\nresist being guided by either of those alternatives. Not fear, certainly. But\nneither by simple, untempered hope. Though the stakes have become much\nhigher since my night flight back from Camp David nearly 15 years ago, our\n11\nneed remains what I tried to impress on my negotiators then: realism. A\nmeticulously informed, utterly unvarnished, understanding of the threats we\nface, of each altered situation after every success or a failure, and an ability to\nset aside the background noise and political pressures and chart a way forward.\nSo what is that way? It begins with the mindset. On more than one occasion\nin the past few years, after Prime Minister Netanyahu had warned our country\nof a nuclear Iran or the spread of Al Qaeda-style hatred and violence, as if\nprophesying the coming of Armageddon, I would say to him: “Stop talking like\nthat. You’re not delivering a sermon in a synagogue. You’re Prime Minister.”\nHaving been privileged to live my own life along with the entire modern history\nof our country, I went further. Zionism, the founding architecture of Israel, was\nrooted in finding a way to supplant not just the life, but the way of thinking,\nwhich hard-pressed Jewish communities had internalised over centuries in the\ndiaspora: in Hebrew, the galut. We would instead take control of our own\ndestiny, building and developing and securing our own country.\nNow, I told Bibi, he was back in the mindset of the galut. Yes, al-Qaeda, and\nmore recently Islamic State, were real dangers. The prospect of a nuclear Iran\nwas even more so. “But the implication of the way you speak, not just to Barack\nObama or David Cameron, but to Israelis, is that these are existential threats.\nWhat do you imagine? That if, God forbid, we wake up and Iran is a nuclear\npower, we’ll pack up and go back to the shtetls of Europe?”\nOf course not. Israel, as my public life has taught me more than most,\nremains strong militarily. We are, still, fully capable of turning back any of the\nundeniable threats on our doorstep. Keeping that strength, developing it and\nmodernizng it, are obviously critically important. But as Israel’s founding Prime\nMinister, David Ben-Gurion, used to say, the success of Zionism, and of the\nIsraeli state, required two things: strength and “righteousness.” He didn’t mean\nthe word in purely religious terms. He meant that Israel, if it were to retain\ninternational backing and internal cohesion, must be guided by a core of moral\nassumptions as well.\nThat, in itself, would be reason enough to pursue every possible opportunity\nfor “end of conflict” with our neighbours. And, at home, to protect and reinforce\nour commitment to Israel as both a Jewish and a democratic state. But\nIsrael’s simple self-interest – its hope for prosperity, social cohesion, and\ngrowth in future – makes this nothing short of imperative.\n12\nBibi is right about one thing. The negotiating challenges have become more\ndifficult since Arafat’s refusal of our offer at Camp David. Arafat is no longer\nalive. Palestinian politics have become ever more fragmented and messy, not\nleast as a result of the Hamas takeover of Gaza.\nBut Churchill once said that the difference between a pessimist and an\noptimist was that the pessimist always saw difficulties in every opportunity. The\noptimist saw opportunities in the difficulties.\nI, of all people, do not look at such opportunities without hard-headed\nanalysis, even a dose of scepticism. But the opportunities are undeniably there,\nand never has Israel risked paying a higher price for failing to see and at least to\ntry to act on them.\nThe first port of call should still be the Palestinians. I have repeatedly asked\nBibi, and the right-wing rivals that seem often to loom large in his political\ncalculations: “If you’re so sure you don’t have a negotiating partner in the\nPalestinians, who not at least try? Seriously. What do you have to lose?”\nBut beyond this, there is a whole range of relatively moderate countries –\nand, as Sunni states, strongly anti-Iranian countries – which share with Israel a\nreal, practical interest in putting in place a new political arrangement in the\nMiddle East. So does the United States, Russia, even China. Each, in their own\nways, is threatened by a terror threat that will require international action, and\nmany years, finally to defeat.\nA Saudi “peace plan”, for instance, has been on the table for years. Formally\nendorsed by the Arab League, it proposes a swap: Israeli withdrawal for full and\nfinal peace and Arab recognition. Successive Israeli governments have\ndismissed it out of hand, arguing that the withdrawal which the Saudi proposal\ndemanded – every inch of territory, back to the borders before the Six-Day War\n– would be not only politically unacceptable, but practically impossible.\nIn the final days of the Camp David summit, as our failure was becoming\ninescapably clear, a disheartened Bill Clinton said to me that he could\nunderstand, just about, why Yasir Arafat had not accepted the unprecedentedly\nfar-reaching proposals I had presented. But what he couldn’t grasp was how the\nPalestinian leader could say no even to accepting them as a basis for the hard,\nfurther work which we all knew a final peace agreement would entail. Wasn’t\nArafat capable of looking beyond the political risks, of understanding the\ngreater risks of inaction. Of seeing the rewards? Of looking ahead?\n13\nMy fear – not just on issues like the Saudi peace plan, but in charting our\nplace in a dramatically changed world, and safeguarding our twin Jewish and\ndemocratic identities at home, pairing our physical strength with an equally\nstrong moral centre – is that we Israelis are now in danger of jettisoning the\nexample of David Ben-Gurion. For Yasir Arafat’s.\n14\nChapter One\nI am an Israeli, but also a Palestinian. I was born in February 1942 in Britishruled\nPalestine on a fledgling kibbutz: a cluster of wood-and-tarpaper huts amid\na few orange groves and vegetable fields and chicken coops. It was just across\nthe road from an Arab village named Wadi Khawaret, which disappeared, with\nthe establishment of the State of Israel, when I was six years old.\nAs Prime Minister half-a-century later, during my stubborn yet ultimately\nfruitless drive to secure a final peace treaty with Yasir Arafat, there were media\nsuggestions that my childhood years gave me a personal understanding of the\npasts of both our peoples, Jews and Arabs, in the land which each of us saw as\nour own. But that is in some ways misleading. Yes, I did know first-hand that\nwe were not alone in our ancestral homeland. At no point in my childhood was I\never taught to hate the Arabs. I never did, even when, in my years defending the\nsecurity of Israel, I had to fight, and defeat, them. But my conviction that they,\ntoo, needed the opportunity to establish a state came only later, after my many\nyears in uniform, and especially when, as deputy chief-of-staff under Yitzhak\nRabin, we were faced with the explosion of violence in the West Bank and Gaza\nthat became known as the first intifada. And while my determination as Prime\nMinister to find a negotiated resolution to our conflict was in part based on a\nrecognition of the Palestinian Arabs’ national aspirations, the main impulse was\nmy belief that such a compromise was profoundly in the interest of Israel: the\nJewish state whose birth I witnessed, whose existence I had spent decades\ndefending on the battlefield and which I was ultimately elected to lead.\nZionism, the political platform for the establishment of a Jewish state,\nemerged in the late 1800s in response to a brutal reality. And that, too, was a\npart of my own family’s story. Most of the world’s Jews, who lived in the\nRussian empire and Poland, were trapped at the time in a vise of poverty,\npowerlessness and anti-Semitic violence. Even in the democracies of Western\nEurope, Jews were not necessarily secure. Theodor Herzl, a thoroughly\nassimilated Jew in Vienna, published the foundation text of Zionism in 1896. It\nwas called Der Judenstaat. “Jews have sincerely tried everywhere to merge\nwith the national communities in which we live, seeking only to preserve the\nfaith of our fathers,” he wrote. “In vain are we loyal patriots, sometimes superloyal.\nIn vain do we make the same sacrifices of life and property as our fellow\ncitizens… In our native lands where we have lived for centuries, we are still\ndecried as aliens.” Zionism’s answer was the establishment of a state of our\n15\nown, in which we could achieve the self-determination and security denied to us\nelsewhere.\nDuring the 1890s and the early years of the new century, more than a million\nJews fled Eastern Europe, but mostly for America. It was only in the 1920s and\n1930s that significant numbers arrived in Palestine. Then, within a few years,\nHitler rose to power in Germany. The Jews of Europe faced not just\ndiscrimination or pogroms. They were systematically, industrially, murdered.\nFrom 1939 until early 1942 when I was born, nearly two million Jews were\nkilled. Six million would die by the end of the war. Almost the whole world,\nincluding the United States, rejected pleas to provide a haven for those who\nmight have been saved. Even after Hitler was defeated, the British shut the\ndoors of Palestine to those who had somehow survived.\n* * *\nI was three when the Holocaust ended, and it was three years later that Israel\nwas established in May 1948, and neighboring Arab states sent in their armies\nto try to snuff the state out in its infancy. It would, again, be some years before I\nfully realized that this first Arab-Israeli war was the start of an essential tension\nin my country’s life, and my own: between the Jewish ethical ideals at the core\nof Zionism and the reality of our having to fight, and sometimes even kill, in\norder to secure, establish and safeguard our state. Yet even as a small child, I\nwas keenly aware of the historic events swirling around me.\nMishmar Hasharon, the hamlet north of Tel Aviv where I spent the first 17\nyears of my life, was one of the early kibbutzim. These collective farming\nsettlements had their roots in Herzl’s view that an avant-garde of “pioneers”\nwould need to settle a homeland that was still economically undeveloped, and\nwhere even farming was difficult. Members of Jewish youth groups from\nEastern Europe, among them my mother, provided most of the pioneers,\ndrawing inspiration not just from Zionism but by the still untainted collectivist\nideals represented by the triumph of Communism over the czars in Russia.\nIt is hard for people who didn’t live through that time to understand the\nmindset of the kibbutzniks. They had higher aspirations than simply planting the\nseeds of a future state. They wanted to be part of transforming what it meant to\nbe a Jew. The act of first taming, and then farming, the soil of Palestine was not\n16\njust an economic imperative. It was seen as deeply symbolic, signifying Jews\nfinally taking control of their own destiny. It was a message that took on an\neven greater power and poignancy after the mass murder of the Jews of Europe\nduring the Holocaust.\nEven for many Israelis nowadays, the all-consuming collectivism of life on\nan early kibbutz, and the physical challenges, are hard to imagine. Among the\nfew dozen families in Mishmar Hasharon when I was born, there was no private\nproperty. Everything was communally owned and allocated. Every penny – or\nIsraeli pound – earned from what we produced went into a communal kitty,\nfrom which each one of the 150-or-so families in Mishmar Hasharon when I\nwas a child got a small weekly allowance. By “small”, I mean tiny. For my\nparents and others, even the idea of an ice cream cone for their children was a\nmatter of keen financial planning. More often, they would save each weekly\npittance with the aim of pooling them at birthday time, where they might stretch\nto the price of a picture book, or a small toy.\nDecisions on any issue of importance were taken at the aseifa, the weekly\nmeeting of kibbutz members held on Saturday nights in our dining hall. The\nagenda would be tacked up on the wall the day before, and the session would\nusually focus on one issue, ranging from major items like the kibbutz’s finances\nto the question, for instance, of whether our small platoon of delivery drivers\nshould be given pocket money to buy a sandwich or a coffee on their days\noutside the kibbutz or be limited to wrapping up bits of the modest fare on offer\nat breakfast time. That debate ended in a classic compromise: a bit of money,\nbut very little, so as to avoid violating the egalitarian ethos of the kibbutz.\nBut perhaps the aspect of life on the kibbutz most difficult for outsiders to\nunderstand, especially nowadays, is that we children were raised collectively.\nWe lived in dormitories, organized by age-group and overseen by a caregiver:\nin Hebrew, a metapelet, usually a woman in her 20s or 30s. For a few hours\neach afternoon and on the Jewish Sabbath, we were with our parents. But\notherwise, we lived and learned in a world consisting almost entirely of other\nchildren.\nEverything around us was geared towards making us feel like a band of\nbrothers and sisters, and as part of the guiding spirit of the kibbutz. Until our\nteenage years, we weren’t even graded in school. And though we didn’t actually\nstudy how to till the land, some of my fondest early memories are of our\n“children’s farm” – the vegetables we grew, the cows we milked, the hens and\nchickens that gave us our first experience of how life was created. And the\n17\naroma always wafting from the stone ovens in the bakery at the heart of the\nkibbutz, where we could see the bare-chested young men producing loaf after\nloaf of bread, not just for Mishmar Hasharon but villages and towns for miles\naround us.\nUntil our teenage years, we lived in narrow, oblong homes, four of us to a\nroom, unfurnished except for our beds, under which we placed our pair of shoes\nor sandals. At one end of the corridor was a set of shelves where we collected a\nclean set of underwear, pants and socks each week. At the other end were the\ntoilets – at that point, the only indoor toilets on the kibbutz, with real toiletseats,\nrather than just holes in the ground. All of us showered together until the\nage of twelve. I can’t think of a single one of us who went on to marry someone\nfrom our own age-group in the kibbutz. It would have seemed almost\nincestuous.\nMishmar Hasharon and other kibbutzim have long since abandoned the\npractice of collective child-rearing. Some in my generation look back on the\nway we were raised not only with regret, but pain: a sense of parental absence,\nabandonment or neglect. My own memories, and those of most of the children I\ngrew up with, are more positive. The irony is that we probably spent more\nwaking time with our parents than town or city children whose mothers and\nfathers worked nine-to-five jobs. The difference came at bedtime, or during the\nnight. If you woke up unsettled, or ill, the only immediate prospect of comfort\nwas from the metapeled, or another of the kibbutz grown-ups who might be on\novernight duty. Still, my childhood memories are overwhelmingly of feeling\nhappy, safe, protected. I do remember waking up once, late on a stormy winter\nnight when I was nine, in the grips of a terrible fever. I’d begun to hallucinate. I\ngot to my feet and, without the thought of looking anywhere else for help, made\nmy wobbly way through the rain to my parents’ room and fell into their bed.\nThey hugged me. They dabbed my forehead with water. The next morning, my\nfather wrapped me in a blanket and took me back to the children’s home.\nTo the extent that I was aware my childhood was different, I was given to\nunderstand it was special, that we were the beating heart of a Jewish state about\nto be born. I once asked my mother why other children got to live in their own\napartments in places like Tel Aviv. “They are ironim,” she said. City-dwellers.\nHer tone made it clear they were to be viewed as a slightly lesser species.\n* * *\n18\nThough both my parents were part of the pioneer generation, my mother,\nunlike my father, actually arrived as a pioneer, part of a Jewish youth group\nfrom Poland that came directly to the kibbutz. In addition to being more\nnaturally outgoing than my father, she came to see Mishmar Hasharon has her\nextended family and spent every one of her one hundred years there.\nEsther Godin, as the then was, grew up in Warsaw. Born in 1913, she was\nthe oldest of the six children of Samuel and Rachel Godin. Poland at the time\nwas home to the largest Jewish community in the world, more than 3 million by\nthe time of the Holocaust. While the Jews of Poland had a long history, the\nGodins did not. Before the First World War, my mother’s parents made their\nway from Smolensk in Russia to Warsaw, which was also under czarist rule.\nWhen the war was over, the Bolshevik Revolution had toppled the czars. Poland\nbecame independent, under the nationalist general Josef Pilsuldski. The Godins\nhad a decision to make: either return to now-Communist Russia or stay in the\nnew Polish state, though without citizenship because they had not been born\nthere. No doubt finding comfort, community and a sense of safety amid the\nhundreds of thousands of Jews in the Polish capital, they chose Pilsuldski over\nLenin. They lived in what would become the Warsaw Ghetto, on Nalewski\nStreet, where Samuel Godin eked out a living as a bookbinder.\nMy mother came to Zionism as a teenager, and it was easy to understand\nwhy she, like so many of the other young Jews around her, was drawn to it. She\nsaw how hard her parents were struggling economically, on the refugee fringes\nof a Jewish community itself precariously placed in a newly assertive Poland.\nShe saw no future for herself there. Though she attended a normal state-run high\nschool, she and her closest friends joined a Zionist youth group called Gordonia,\nwhich had been founded in Poland barely a decade earlier. She started studying\nHebrew. Each summer, from the age of 13, she and her Gordonia friends would\nspend deep in the Carpathian Mountains. They worked for local Polish\nlandowners, learning the rudiments of how to farm and the rigors of simple\nphysical labor. Late into the evening, they would learn not just about agriculture\nbut Jewish history, the land of Palestine, and how they hoped to put both their\nnew-found skills and the Zionist ideals into practice.\nShe had just turned 22 when she set off for Mishmar Hasharon with 60 other\nGordonia pioneers in the summer of 1935. It took them nearly a week to get\nthere. They travelled by train south through Poland, passing not far from the\nlittle town of Oświęcim which would later become infamous as the site of the\nAuschwitz concentration camp. Then, on through Hungary and across Romania\n19\nto the grand old Black Sea port of Constanța, and by ship through the\nBosphorus, past Istanbul, and on to Haifa on the Palestinian coast, from where\nthey were taken by truck to their bunk-bed rooms in one of a dozen prefab\nstructures on the recently established kibbutz. Though the water came from a\nwell, and it lacked even the basic creature comforts of the cramped Godin\napartment in Warsaw, that, to my mother, was just part of the challenge, and the\ndream, she’d embraced and had come to define her. I know that she felt, on\narriving in the kibbutz, that only now was her life truly beginning.\nIt was a feeling that never left her. Yet it was always clouded by the memory\nof the family she left behind. When the Second World War began in September\n1939, the Germans, and then the Soviets, invaded, overran and divided Poland.\nTwo of my mother’s three sisters fled to Moscow. Her teenage brother Avraham\nwent underground, joining the anti-Nazi partisans. All three would survive the\nwar. Yet in the autumn of 1940, the rest of her family found themselves inside\nthe Warsaw Ghetto with the city’s other 400,000 Jews. My mother’s parents\ndied there, along with her 13-year-old brother Itzik and her little sister Henya,\nwho was only 11.\nWhen my mother arrived in the kibbutz, her Gordonia friends assumed she\nwould marry a young man named Ya’akov Margalit, the leader of their group\nback in Warsaw. But the budding romance fell victim to the Zionist cause. As\nshe was embarking on her new life, he was frequently back in Poland training\nand arranging papers for further groups of pioneers. He continued to write her\nlong, heartfelt letters. But the letters had to be brought from the central post\noffice in Tel Aviv, and the kibbutznik who fetched the mail was a quiet,\ndimunitive 25-year-old named Yisrael Mendel Brog – my father. Known as\nSrulik, his Yiddish nickname, he had come to Palestine five years earlier. He\nwas an ordinary kibbutz worker. He drove a tractor.\nMy father’s initial impulse in coming to Palestine was more personal than\npolitical. He was born, in 1910, in the Jewish shtetl of Pushelat in Lithuania,\nnear the larger Jewish town of Ponovezh, a major seat of rabbinic learning and\nteaching. His own father, though the only member of the Pushelat community\nwith rabbinical training, made his living as the village pharmacist. Many of the\nroughly 10,000 Jews who lived there had left for America in the great exodus\nfrom Russian and Polish lands at the end of the 19 th century. By the time my\nfather was born, the community had shrunk to only about 1,000. When he was\ntwo years old, a fire broke out, destroying dozens of homes, as well as the\nshtetl’s only synagogue. Donations soon arrived from the US, and my paternal\n20\ngrandfather was put in charge of holding the money until rebuilding plans were\nworked out. The problem was that word spread quickly about the rebuilding\nfund. On the night of September 16, 1912, two burglars burst into my\ngrandfather’s home and stole the money. They beat him and my grandmother to\ndeath with an axle wrenched loose from a nearby carriage. Their four-year-old\nson Meir – my father’s older brother – suffered a deep wound from where the\nattackers drove the metal shaft into his head. He carried a golf-ball-sized\nindentation in his forehead for the rest of his life. My father had burrowed into a\ncorner, and the attackers didn’t see him.\nThe two orphaned boys were raised by their paternal grandmother, Itzila. Yet\nany return to normalcy they may have experienced was cut short by the\noutbreak of the First World War, forcing her to flee with them by train ahead of\nthe advancing German army. They ended up some 1,500 miles south, in the\nCrimean city of Simferopol. Initially under czarist rule, then the Bolsheviks and\nfrom late 1917 until the end of the war under the Germans, they had to deal with\ncold, damp and a chronic shortage of food. My Uncle Meir quickly learned how\nto survive. He later told me that he would run after German supply carriages\nand collect the odd potato that fell off the back. Realizing that the German\nsoldiers had been wrenched from their own families by the war, he began taking\nmy father with him on weekends to the neighborhood near their barracks, where\nthe soldiers would sometimes give them cookies, or even a loaf of bread. Yet\nthey were deprived of the basic ingredients of a healthy childhood: nutritious\nfood and a warm, dry room in which to sleep. By the time Itzila brought them\nback to settle in Ponovezh at the end of the war, my father was diagnosed with\nthe bone-development disease, rickets, caused by the lack of Vitamin D in their\ndiet.\nIn another way, however, my father was the more fortunate of the boys. The\nlost schooling of those wartime years came at a less formative time for him than\nfor his brother. Meir never fully made up the lost ground in school. My father\nsimply began his Jewish primary education, cheder, a couple of years later than\nusual. He thrived there. Still, when it was time for him to enter secondary\neducation, he decided against going on with his religious education. Meir was\npreparing to leave for Palestine, so my father enrolled in the Hebrew-language,\nZionist high school. When he graduated, one of the many Brog relatives who\nwere by now living in the United States, his Uncle Jacob, tried to persuade him\nto come to Pittsburgh for university studies. But with Meir signing on as his\nsponsor with the British Mandate authorities, he left for Palestine shortly before\n21\nhis twentieth birthday. Jacob did still insist on helping financially, which\nallowed my father to enroll at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\nHe did well in his studies – literature, history and philosophy – but\nabandoned them after two years. His explanation for not staying on, when I\nasked him years later, was that with the accelerating activity of the Zionist\npioneers, it felt wrong to him to spend his days going to lectures, reading books\nand writing essays. I am sure that he also felt isolated and alone, with Meir, the\nonly link to his life before Palestine, working in Haifa on the coast, four or five\nhours by bus from Jerusalem. When he began looking for a way to become part\nof the changes going on around him, Mishmar Hasharon didn’t yet exist. Its\nfounding core – a dozen Russian Jewish pioneers – was still working on\nargicultural settlements near Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, until they found a\nplace to start their kibbutz. But they had been joined by several young men and\nwomen who, though a year or two older than my father, had been with him at\nthe Hebrew High School in Ponovezh. He decided to join them.\nLate in 1932, the Jewish National Fund, supported financially by leading\nJewish figures in western Europe and the US, bought 2,000 acres from an Arab\nlandowner near Wadi Khawaret. The area was set aside for three Jewish\nsettlements: a moshav called Kfar Haim, where the land was divided into family\nplots, and two kibbutzim. One was called Ma’abarot. Next to it was Mishmar\nHasharon. My father was among the seventy youngsters who set off in three\ntrucks with everything they figured they would need to turn the hard, scrubby\nhill into a kibbutz. They built the core from pre-fab kits: wooden huts to sleep in\nand a slightly larger one for the dining hall. They dug a well and ordered a\npump from Tel Aviv, at first for drinking and washing, but soon allowing them\nto begin a vegetable garden, a dairy with a dozen cows, a chicken coop with a\nfew hundred hens, and to plant a first orange grove and a small vineyard.\nStill, by the time my mother arrived three years later, there were not enough\ncitrus trees, vines, cattle and chickens to occupy a membership which now\nnumbered more than 200. Along with some of the others, my father worked\noutside the kibbutz, earning a regular paycheck to help support the collective.\nOn his way back, he would stop at the post office in Tel Aviv to pick up letters\nand packages for the rest of the kibbutz – including Ya’akov Margalit’s love\nletters to my mother. That was how my parents’ friendship began, how a\nfriendly hello led to shared conversation at the end of my father’s working day,\nand how, a few years later, my mother decided to spurn her Gordonia suitor in\nfavor of Srulik Brog, the postman. It was not until 1939 that they moved in\n22\ntogether. They didn’t bother getting married until the summer of 1941. Perhaps\nbecause this was less than nine months before I was born, my mother always\nremained vague when asked their exact wedding date.\nMy parents were an unlikely pair. My mother – bright, lively and energetic –\nwas a doer, who believed passionately in the grand social experiment of kibbutz\nlife. Having helped her mother raise her siblings in Warsaw, and with a natural\naffinity from children, she became the main authority on issues related to\nchildbirth and early childcare. She actively partook in the kibbutz’s planning\nand politics, and reveled in its social life. My father was more detached both\npolitically and socially. He was more contemplative, less assertive, less selfconfident.\nThough he agreed broadly with the founding principles of the\nkibbutz, and wanted to play his role in making it a success, I could see, as I\ngrew older, that he was often impatient at what he saw as its intellectual\ninsularity and its ideological rigidities.\nThough it didn’t strike me at the time, he was not a large man. As a result of\nhis childhood illness, he never grew to more than five-foot-four. Still, he was a\npowerful presence, stocky and strong from his work on the kibbutz. He had a\ndeep, resonant voice and wise-looking, blue-gray eyes. It was only through\nUncle Meir that by the time I was born, he had moved on from driving a tractor\nto a more influential role on the kibbutz. Meir worked for the Palestine Electric\nCompany and when Mishmar Hasharon installed its own electricity system, the\nPEC was in charge of the work. Meir trained my father and put him forward as\nthe kibbutz contact for maintaining and repairing the equipment. He was well\nsuited for the work. He was a natural tinkerer, a problem-solver. He was good\nwith his hands, and his natural caution was an additional asset as the kibbutz got\nto grips with the potential, and the potential dangers, of electric power. Once the\nsystem was installed, he became responsible for managing any aspect of the\nsettlement that involved electricity: water pumps, the irrigation system, the\ncommunal laundry and our bakery.\nMy parents were courteous and polite with each other, but they never\nshowed any physical affection in our presence. None of the adults did. This was\npart of an unspoken kibbutz code. Not only for kibbutzniks, but for all the early\nZionists, outward displays of emotion were seen as a kind of selfishness that\nrisked undermining communal cohesion, tenacity and strength. Because I’d\nknown no other way, this did not strike me as odd. Besides, I was a quiet,\ncontemplative, bookish and self-contained child. Only in later years did I come to\nsee the lasting effect on me. It was be a long time before I became comfortable\n23\nshowing my feelings, beyond my immediate family and a few close friends.\nWhen I was in the army, this wasn’t an issue. Self-control, especially in highpressure\nsituations, was a highly valued asset. But in politics, I think that it did for a\nconsiderable time inhibit my ability to connect with the public, or at least with\nthe news media that played such a critical intermediary role. And it caused me\nto be seen not just as reserved or aloof, but sometimes as cold, or arrogant.\nI did get much that I value from my parents. From my mother, her\nboundless energy, activism, her attention to detail, and her focus on causes\nlarger than herself – her belief that politics mattered. Also her love for art and\nliterature. When I would come home from the children’s dormitory to my\nparents’ room – just nine feet by ten, with a wooden trundle bed to save space\nduring the day – there was always a novel or a book of verse sharing the small\ntable with my parents’ most single prized possession: their kibbutz-issue radio.\nAs a child, however, I spent much more time with my father. He was my\nguide, my protector and role model. Like my mother, he never mentioned the\ntrials which they and their families endured before arriving in Palestine. Nor did\nthey ever speak to me in any detail about the Holocaust. No one on the kibbutz\ndid. It was as if the memories were scabs they dared not pick at. Also, it\nseemed, because they were determined to avoid somehow passing on these\nremembered sadnesses to their sons and daughters. Still, when I was ten or\neleven, my father did – once, inadvertently – open a window on his childhood.\nEvery Saturday morning, we would listen to a classical music concert on my\nparents’ radio. One day, as the beautiful melodies of Tchaikovsky’s violin\nconcerto in D came through the radio, I was struck by the almost trancelike look\nthat came over my father’s face. He seemed to be in another, faraway, place.\nWhen the music ended, he turned and told me about the first time he’d heard it.\nIt was on the train ride into Crimean exile with Itzila and Meir in the early days\nof the First World War. The train took five days to reach the Crimea and\nsometimes halted for hours at a time. Every evening, a man at the far end of\ntheir carriage would take out his violin and play the second movement of the\nTchaikovsky concerto.\nI have heard the piece in concert halls many times since. When the orchestra\nbegins the second movement – with the violin notes climbing higher, trembling\never so subtly – it sends a shiver down my spine. I can’t help thinking of the\nrailway car in which my then four-year-old father and other Jews from\nPonovezh escaped the Great War of 1914. And of other trains, in another war 25\nyears later, carrying Jews not to safety but to death camps.\n24\nListening to the concert program in my parents’ room was something I\nalways looked forward to. It was my father who encouraged me, when I was\neight, to begin learning to play the piano. I took lessons once a week all during\nmy childhood along with several other of the kibbutz children. When we got old\nenough, we took turns playing a short piece – the secular, kibbutz equivalent of\nan opening prayer – at the Friday-night meal in the dining hall. I have always\ncherished being able to play. Sitting down at the piano and immersing myself in\nTchaikovsky, Beethoven, Schubert or Mozart never ceases to bring me a sense\nof calm, freedom and, especially nowadays, when I have finally worked to\nmaster a particularly intricate piece, a feeling of pure joy.\n* * *\nAs a young child, I spent most of my waking hours in the company of my\nseveral dozen kibbutz “siblings” in the children’s home, the dining hall, or\nrunning through the open spaces in the center of the kibbutz with our metapelet.\nShe would often take us through the orange groves in the afternoon, and\nsometimes across the main road to the Arab village.\nWadi Khawaret consisted of a few dozen concrete homes built back from a\nmain street bordered by shops and storehouses. She would buy us sweets in the\nlittle grocery store. The man behind the counter had a kindly, weathered face\nand a dark moustache. Dressed in a gray galabiya and a keffiyeh, he smiled\nwhen we came in. There was always a group of Palestinian women, in fulllength\nrobes, seated on stoops outside breastfeeding their babies. We saw cattle,\nbulls, even the odd buffalo, being led to or from the fields. I sensed no hostility,\nand certainly no hatred, toward us in the village. The people seemed warm, and\nbenignly indifferent to the dozen Jewish toddlers and their metapelet. My own\nattitude to Wadi Khawaret was of benign curiosity. I did not imagine that within\na couple of years we would be on opposite sides of a war. I enjoyed these visits,\nas I enjoyed every part of my early childhood. Each age-group on the kibbutz\nwas given a name. Ours was called dror. It was the Hebrew word for\n“freedom”.\nBut dror was also the name of one of the Jewish youth movements in the\nWarsaw Ghetto, heroes in their doomed uprising against the Nazis. Little by\nlittle, from about the age of five, I became more aware of the suffering the Jews\nhad so recently endured in the lands my parents had left behind, the growing\n25\ntension around us and the sense that something momentous was about to happen\nas the prospect of a state got closer.\nThe memories remain with me to this day, like a series of snapshots. It was\non a spring morning in 1947 that I got my first real sense that the Jewish state\nwas something which would have be fought for, and that youngsters not all that\nmuch older than me would have a critical role to play. I got a close-up look at\nthe elite of the Zionist militias, the Palmach. It numbered something like 6,000,\nfrom a pre-state force totaling around 40,000. The Palmachniks were highly\nmotivated, young political activists. They had no fixed base. Each platoon,\nalmost all of them teenagers, spent five or six months at a time on various\nkibbutzim. For the first two weeks of each month, they would earn their keep by\nworking in the fields. They spent the other weeks training. I had just turned five\nwhen I watched three dozen Palmach boys and girls, in their T-shirts and short\nkhaki pants, rappel confidently down the side of one of our few concrete\nbuildings. The building was only 25 or 30 feet high, but it looked like a\nskyscraper from my perch on the grass in front, and the feat of the young\nPalmachniks seemed to me nothing short of heroic.\nA few months later, on a Saturday afternoon in November 1947, I crowded\ninto my parents’ room as the Haganah radio station crackled out its account of a\nUnited Nations debate on the future of Palestine. The session was the outcome\nof a long train of events starting with Britain’s acknowledgement that its\nmandate to rule over Palestine was unsustainable. The British had proposed a\nseries of arrangements to accommodate both Arab and Jewish aspirations. Now,\nthe UN was meeting to consider the idea of splitting Palestine into two new\nstates, one Arab and the other Jewish.\nSince the partition was based on existing areas of Arab and Jewish\nsettlement, the proposed Jewish state looked like a boomerang, with a long,\nvery narrow center strip along the Mediterranean, broadening slightly into the\nGalilee in the north and the arid coastline in the south. Jerusalem, the site of the\nancient Jewish temple, was not part of it. It was to be placed under international\nrule. By no means all Zionist leaders were happy with partition. Many, on both\nthe political right and the left, wanted a Jewish state in all of Palestine, with\nJerusalem as its centerpiece. But Ben-Gurion and the pragmatic mainstream\nargued that UN endorsement of a Jewish state – no matter what its borders, even\nwith a new Palestinian Arab state alongside it – would represent a historic\nachievement. The proceedings went on for hours. At sundown, we had to return\nto the children’s home. But we were woken before dawn. The vote for partition\n26\n– for the Jewish state Herzl had first dreamed of 50 years before – had been\nwon. A huge bonfire blazed in front of the bakery. All around us the grown-ups\nwere singing and dancing in celebration.\nOn the Arab side, there was no rejoicing. Every one of the Arab delegations\nat the UN voted against partition, rejecting a Jewish state even if it was created\nalong with a Palestinian Arab one. Violence erupted the next day. An attack on\na bus near Lydda, near the road up to Jerusalem, left six Jews dead. Similar\nattacks occurred around the country. Shooting broke out in mixed Arab-and-\nJewish towns and cities: Jaffa on the southern edge of Tel Aviv. Safed, Tiberias\nand Haifa in the north, and in Jerusalem.\nI followed all this with curiosity and trepidation through my halting attempts\nto read Davar le Yeladim, the weekly children’s edition of the Labour Zionist\nnewspaper Davar. We children felt an additional connection with what was\ngoing on. One of our Dror housemates, a boy named Giora Ros, had left the\nyear before when his father took a job in Jerusalem. As the battle for the city\nraged through the end of 1947 and into 1948, its besieged Jewish residents\nfought for their lives. We sent our friend packages of clothing and food, which\nwe saved up by eating only half of an egg at breakfast and smaller portions at\ndinner.\nThe mood darkened further at the end of January 1948, four months before the\nBritish departed. A cluster of settlements known as Gush Etzion, south of\nJerusalem near the hills of Bethlehem, also came under siege. Around midnight\non January 15, a unit of Haganah youngsters set off on foot to try to break\nthrough. They became known as “The 35”. Marching through the night from\nJerusalem, they had made it only within a couple of miles of Gush Etzion when\nthey were surrounded and attacked by local Arabs. By late afternoon, all of\nthem were dead. When the British authorities recovered their bodies, they found\nthat the enemy had not simply killed them. All of the bodies had been battered\nand broken. Rumors spread that in some cases, the dead men’s genitals had\nbeen cut off and shoved into their mouths. Since I was still a few weeks short of\nmy sixth birthday, I was spared that particular detail. But not the sense of horror\nover what had happened, nor the central message: the lengths and depths to\nwhich the Arabs of Palestine seemed ready to go in their fight against us.\n“Hit’alelu bagufot!” was the only slightly sanitized account we children were\ngiven. “They mutilated the corpses!”\nEven after the partition vote, statehood was not a given. In the weeks before\nthe British left, two senior Americans –the ambassador to the UN and Secretary\n27\nof State George C. Marshall – recommended abandoning or at least delaying the\ndeclaration of an Israeli state. Yet Ben-Gurion feared that any delay risked the\nend of any early hope of statehood. After he managed to secure a one-vote\nmajority in his de facto cabinet, the state was declared on May 14, 1948.\nAnd hours later, the armies of five Arab states crossed into Palestine.\n28\nChapter Two\nThe 1948 war and the decade that followed remain vivid in my mind not just\nfor the obvious reason: they secured the survival of the infant state of Israel and\nsaw it into a more assured and independent young adulthood. It was also the\ntime when I grew from a young child –introspective and contemplative, aware\nof how quickly my mind seemed to grasp numbers and geometric shapes and\nmusical notes, but also small for my age and awkward at the sports we’d play\non the dusty field at the far edge of the kibbutz – into a sense of my own place\nin the family and community and the country around me. I did, along the way,\nbecome arguably the most effective left defensive back on our kibbutz soccer\nteam. But that was not because I suddenly discovered a buried talent for the\ngame. Physically, I was like my father. I had natural hand coordination which\nmade delicate tasks come easily – one reason I would soon discover a pastime\nthat lent itself to acts of kibbutz mischief bordering on juvenile delinquency.\nBut when it came to larger muscles, I was hapless, if not hopeless. My prowess\nas a soccer defenseman was because no opposing player in his right mind, once\nI’d inadvertently cut his knees from under him when aiming for the ball, felt it\nwas worth coming anywhere close to me.\nBut when the war broke out in earnest in the spring of 1948, my focus, like\nthat of all Israelis, was on the fighting, which even the youngest of us knew\nwould determine whether the state would survive at all. Day after day, my\nfather helped me to chart each major advance and setback on a little map.\nDozens of kibbutzim around the country were in the line of fire. Some had soon\nfallen, while others were barely managing to hang on. Just five miles inland\nfrom us, an Israeli settlement came under attack by an Iraqi force in the nearby\nArab village of Qaqun.\nBut inside Mishmar Hasharon, I had the almost surreal feeling that this great\nhistorical drama was something happening everywhere else but on our kibbutz.\nIf it hadn’t been for the radio, or the newsreels which we saw in weekly movie\nnights in the dining hall, and the little map on which I traced its course with my\nfather, I would barely have known a war was going on. One Arab army did get\nnear to us: the Iraqis, in Qaqun. If they had advanced a few miles further, they\ncould have overrun Mishmar Hasharon, reached the coast and cut the new\nJewish state in half. I can still remember the rumble of what sounded like\nthunder one morning in June 1948, as the Alexandronis, one of the twelve\nbrigades in the new Israeli army, launched their decisive attack on the Iraqis.\n29\n“No reason to be afraid,” our metapelet kept telling me. That only made me\nmore scared. Yet within a few hours, everything was quiet again, and never\nagain did the shellfire get near to us. A few weeks later, I heard the only gunfire\ninside the kibbutz itself. It came from the top of our water tower. The man on\nguard duty thought he saw movement on the road outside. But it turned out to\nbe nothing.\nIt wasn’t until well into 1949 that formal agreements were signed and\n“armistice line” borders drawn with the Arab states. By the measure that\nmattered most – survival – Israel had won and the Arab attackers had lost.\nJordan did end up in control of the West Bank, as well as the eastern half of a\ndivided city of Jerusalem, including the walled Old City and the site of the\nancient Jewish temple. The new Israel remained, at least geographically,\nvulnerable. It was just 11 miles wide around Tel Aviv and even narrower,\nbarely half that, near Mishmar Hasharon. Egyptian-held Gaza was seven miles\nfrom the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon and just 40 from the outskirts of Tel\nAviv.\nIsrael did secure control of the entire Galilee, up to the pre-war borders with\nLebanon and Syria, and of the Negev Desert in the south. The territory of our\nnew state was about a third larger than the area proposed under the UN partition\nplan rejected by the Arabs. Yet the victory came at a heavy price: more than\n6,000 dead, one per cent of the Jewish population of Palestine at the time. It was\nas if America had lost two million in the Vietnam War. One-third of the Israeli\ndead were Holocaust survivors.\nThe Arabs paid a heavy price too, and not just the roughly 7,000 people who\nlost their lives. Nearly 700,000 Palestinian Arabs had fled – or, in some cases,\nbeen forced to flee – towns and villages in what was now Israel. The full extent\nand circumstances of the Arabs’ flight became known to us at Mishmar\nHasharon only later. But it did not take long to notice the change around us.\nWadi Khawaret was physically still there, but all of the villagers were gone. As\nfar as I could discover, none had been killed. They left with a first wave of\nrefugees in April 1948, and eventually ended up near Tulkarem on the West\nBank. After the war, the Israeli government divided up their farmland among\nnearby kibbutzim including Mishmar Hasharon.\nThe absence of our former neighbors in Wadi Khawaret seemed to me at the\ntime simply a part of the war. From the moment the violence started, I\nunderstood there would be suffering on both sides. When we sent our care\npackages to Giora Ros in Jerusalem, I remember trying to imagine what “living\n30\nunder siege” would feel like, and what would happen to Giora if it succeeded.\nEspecially after the murder and the mutilation of The 35, I assumed the war\nwould come down to a simple calculus. If there was going to be an Israel – if\nthere was going to be a Mishmar Hasharon – we had to win and the Arabs had\nto lose. At first, even the fact our kibbutz had been given a share of the land of\nWadi Khawaret seemed just another product of the war. After all, Ben-Gurion\nhad accepted the plan for two states. The Arabs had said no, deciding to attack\nus instead. Someone had to farm the land. Why not us?\n* * *\nYet events after the war did lead me to begin to ask myself questions of\nbasic fairness, and whether we were being faithful to some of the high-sounding\nideals I heard spoken about with such pride on the kibbutz. The Palestinians\nwere not the only refugees. More than 600,000 Jews fled into Israel from Arab\ncountries where they had lived for generations. More than 100,000 arrived from\nIraq, and several hundred thousand from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria in north\nAfrica. Immediately after the war, about 50,000 were airlifted out of Yemen,\nwhere they had endured violent attacks ever since the UN partition vote.\nThe reality that greeted the Yemenis in Israel was more complex. Most were\ninitially settled in tented transit camps. I’m not sure how several dozen Yemeni\nfamilies made their way to Wadi Khawaret, but it made sense for them to move\ninto the village’s vacant homes. It was empty except for several deserted\nbuildings which we and other kibbutzim began using for storage and, later, for\nour transport co-operative. Yet a few nights after the Yemenis moved in, a\nposse of young men, including some from Mishmar Hasharon, descended on\nthem and, armed with clubs and wooden staves, drove them away.\nI was shocked. I’d seen the photos in Davar le Yeladim celebrating the\nairlift, with the Yemenis kissing the airport tarmac in relief, gratitude and joy at\nfinding refuge in the new Israeli state. Now, for the “crime” of moving into a\nrow of empty buildings in search of a decent place to live, they’d been beaten\nup and chased away. By us. I realized Wadi Khawaret no longer belonged to the\nArabs. But, surely, our kibbutz had no more right to the buildings than Jews\nwho had fled from Yemen and needed them a lot more than we did. For days, I\ntried to discover who had joined the vigilante attack. Though everyone seemed\nto know what had happened, no one talked about it. In the dining hall, I ran my\n31\neyes over all the boys in their late teens and early 20s. I was sure that after\nsomething like this there had to be some sign of who had done it. But they\nlooked the same as before, eating and talking as if nothing had happened.\nThe Yemenis also needed jobs. This led to a challenge for Mishmar\nHasharon. The core of the kibbutz ethos was that we would live from our own\nlabor. Yet Ben-Gurion insisted we and other kibbutzim provide work for the\nYemenis and other new arrivals from the Arab states. We began hiring Yemeni\nworkers when I was about ten, the age when we kids started working for an\nhour or so each day in the fields. We worked alongside several dozen Yemeni\nwomen who lived a few miles north in a maabarah, a transit settlement which\nlater evolved into a village called Elyakhin. Each morning, the Yemenis arrived\nin a bus, and they left at the end of their day’s work.\nI don’t know whether I expected to feel a Gordonian sense of joy at the\nredemptive value of physical labor when I began working in the fields. Our first\nassignment was to plant long rows of flower bulbs – gladioli – spaced at\nintervals of four inches or so. But as I joined the other children and the Yemeni\nwomen, what I felt was more mundane. Heat. Fatigue. Boredom. To make the\ntime pass, I thought of it as a competition. Each of us began together, planting\nthe bulbs in furrows stretching to the end of the field. The point was obviously\nto do it right. But I found it interesting to see who finished first, and how much\nlonger it took the rest of us.\nThe same worker always led the way. She was a Yemeni in her early thirties.\nHer name was Baddura. Short and stocky, with dark curly hair, she was nearly\nalways smiling, whether we were planting bulbs, sowing seeds or picking\noranges and grapefruit and lemons, potatoes or peppers and tomatoes. When I\nremarked to her how much better and faster she was than the rest of us, she\nlaughed. Still years away from growing into my adult body, I looked more like a\neight- or a nine-year-old. She took me under her wing. The next day, we were\npicking tomatoes. “Do the row next to mine,” she said. Watching the almost\nballetic grace with which she moved made it easier. I decided it was like\nmastering a new piece on the piano. The secret was to achieve a kind of\nunthinking fluidity, by focusing on the passage one or two ahead of the one you\nwere playing. Physically, Baddura was far stronger than me. Before long,\nhowever, I was finishing my sowing or reaping a good ten yards ahead of the\nother kids, and not too far behind her.\nThough the Yemenis worked in our fields, they were not members of the\nkibbutz. They were paid a day-rate. Though they were by far the most\n32\nproductive workers, they got no share of what we produced or possessed. A few\nyears later, I raised this at one of the separate aseifa meetings held by young\npeople on the kibbutz, only to be told we’d never wanted to employ outsiders in\nthe first place. It was only because of Ben-Gurion that we felt unable to refuse.\nI’m sure that was true, but it seemed to me an incomplete answer, and an\nevasion. It struck me as an exercise in finding a verbal rationale for a situation\nthat was obviously unjust.\nIt was an accidental glance up from picking carrots which focused in my\nmind the sense of unfairness I felt. We were working on a tract of about seven\nacres of rich, dark soil where we grew carrots, tomatoes and potatoes and\neggplants. I think I was 11 or 12. We had assembled in the early afternoon near\nthe kibbutz garage. We piled on to a flatbed trailer, a dozen kids and a dozen\nYemeni women. We were towed by a tractor driven by a man named Yankele.\nHe was in his mid-40s. Like my father, he was one of the original group at\nMishmar Hasharon. Before the Yemenis came, he had worked planting and\nharvesting. Now, he was responsible for “managing” the Yemenis, and us kids\nas well, during our fieldwork. He paced among us every half-hour or so to make\nsure the work was going smoothly. Though the area was ankle-deep in mud\nduring in the winter, it was hot and dusty in the summer. I’d been working for\nan hour or so, crouching alongside Baddura, when I looked up. On the edge of\nthe field, under the shade of a clump of banana trees, I saw Yankele. He had a\nset of keys on a metal chain. He was twirling them around his finger, first one\nway, then the other, as his eyes tracked us and our Yemeni co-workers. Like a\nkibbutznik-turned-plantation-owner.\n* * *\nAs a February baby, I was the youngest in our age group. In the tiny world of\nthe kibbutz, there were not enough children to organize separate school classes\nfor each year. When I started school, I was five-and-a-half. Most of the others\nwere six. A few had already turned seven. Maybe it was this age pressure, or\nmaybe something inside me, but from the outset, I had a thirst for knowledge. I\nwas aware early on that some of the schoolwork came easily, almost\nautomatically to me: numbers and math and reasoning most of all. I also began\nreading books, even if I could not fully understand them. By the time I was\neight or nine, I was burying myself in volumes of the children’s encyclopedia at\n33\nthe kibbutz library, trying to untangle the mysteries of airplanes and\nautomobiles, or the creation of worldly wonders, from the Hanging Gardens of\nBabylon to the Empire State Building and the Golden Gate Bridge.\nAt first, I got many of the answers from my father. On Saturdays, we would\nwalk around the kibbutz as I plied him with questions. In many ways, he always\nlacked self-confidence. I remember decades later, after he had passed away,\nasking my mother how come they had spent their entire lives on the kibbutz and\nnever moved away. She replied: “What would your father have done outside?”\nBut he had a quick mind and, despite having left Hebrew University early, had\nsecured enough credits to get his degree – one of a handful of men on the\nkibbutz to have done so. He delighted in acquiring, and sharing, knowedge.\nHow come the moon wasn’t always round, I remember asking him in one of\nour first educational strolls. How did anyone know that the sabertooth tigers I’d\nseen in the encyclopedia actually existed? And where were they now? There\nwas not a single question he did not try to help me answer. When I was nine or\nten, he took me to see the first water pump on the kibbutz. I watched as he\ndisassembled the casing, then the power unit, which had a big screw-like\nelement in the middle. I wanted to know how it worked, how it was designed.\nHow it was made. A few months later, he took me to the factory near Tel Aviv\nwhere the pumps were manufactured.\nI was an introverted child, not so much shy as self-contained, contemplative,\nat times dreamy. Our metapelet from when I was three until age eight was\nnamed Bina. She was the mother of twins a year younger than me. She was\nmore handsome than beautiful, with wavy dark hair. But she was full of\nwarmth. She was especially kind to me, which was no doubt one reason I felt\nthe effects of my collective upbringing less dramatically than some other\nkibbutz children. When we were both much older, she used tell a story about my\nslightly ethereal approach to life when I was in her charge. One winter\nafternoon when I was four, she took our group on to the gentle rise on the\nnorthern edge of the kibbutz, which at that time of year was full of wildflowers.\nWhen she got there, she realized I had gone missing. Retracing her steps, she\nfound me standing in front of a rock in the middle of the dirt path. “Ehud,” she\nsaid, “why didn’t you come with us?” I apparently replied: “I’m thinking: which\nside of the rock should I go around?”\nStill, important though Bina was as a presence in my life, it was the\ninfluence of another figure – another youngster – who mattered more and for\nlonger. His name was Yigal Garber. In first grade, every child got a mentor.\n34\nYigal was mine. Solidly built and self-confident, with a knowing smile, he\nwould go on to become one of the most respected members of the kibbutz.\nThough I was the only child he mentored, he was also in charge of our class’s\nextracurricular educational program. It began when I was ten, and Yigal was\nsixteen. It was a mix of ideological training – the kibbutz equivalent of what my\nmother had done with her Gordonia friends in Poland – and a scouting course.\nOne evening a week, he would spend several hours with us. He began by\nreading us a story or a poem. One which I remember with particular clarity\ninvolved a slave who had a nail driven into his ear in hopes of remaining in his\nmaster’s service forever. He had become enslaved not only in body, but in\nmind. Another night, Yigal read us an account of a Palmach unit stranded on a\nhill they had taken, with anti-personnel mines all around them. The readings\nwere gripping and they were always an entry-point for a discussion: how did we\nunderstand the story? What would we do if faced with a similar choice?\nWhen that part was over, he walked us into the fields outside the kibbutz.\nThe only sound we heard was the occasional screech of a jackal. Sometimes, he\nwould split us into twos and have each pair set off from a far edge of the field\nand find our way back. Yigal stationed himself at the center. We would have to\nsneak up and see which of us could get closest without his seeing or hearing us\napproach. In his last year with us before leaving for his army service, he gave\neach of us a narrow wooden stick and began drilling us in the teenage\nintroduction to martial arts. But I was less interested in that part of the training\nthan the scouting exercises. Not only was I the youngest in our group, and the\nsmallest, except for a couple of the girls. Notwithstanding my accidental\nprowess on the soccer field, I lacked the strength and coordination to hold my\nown in most physical contests at the time.\n* * *\nYet then, shortly after I turned thirteen, I overheard a conversation between a\ncouple of older kids in the dining hall. They said there was this guy in Gan\nShmuel, a kibbutz to the north of us, who had an “amazing” ability. Using a\nstrip of steel shaped to work like a key, he could open locks – even chunky Yale\npadlocks, the gold standard in those days – in less than a minute.\n35\nI was intrigued by the mechanical puzzle and managed to locate two slightly\nrusted locks. One was a Yale, the other an Israeli-made lookalike called a\nNabob. One evening after dinner, I searched the ground around the kibbutz\ngarage for shards of metal that looked like they might fit into the key slot, and\nspent the next half-hour or so propped against a tree, trying and failing to coax\neither lock to open. I realized I would need to discover how the locks worked.\nBut how to get inside to see?\nSaturday afternoons in Mishmar Hasharon were a quiet time, like the old\nJewish neighborhoods and shtetls back in Europe but minus the religious\ntrappings. The next day, I waited until mid-afternoon and walked past the\nbakery towards the garage. Its roll-down, corrugated door was locked. So was\nthe structure next to it, where the blacksmith and metalwork shop were. But\nattached to the blacksmith’s was a hut where our scrap metal was dumped. I\ndoubted it would be locked, and it wasn’t. Pausing to let my eyes get used to the\ndark, I made my way into the metalwork area. I crossed to the cabinet where the\ntools were kept. I took out a steel jigsaw used for cutting through metal and,\nhiding it under my shirt, made my way out again.\nFortunately, the saw was up to the task of cutting into the softer alloy that\nmade up the body of the locks. Once I’d cut inside them, I saw they shared the\nsame basic construction. There was a series of springs and shafts which, in\nresponse to the indentations of a key, aligned in such a way to allow the lock to\nopen. I sneaked back into the metalwork shop five or six times. By trial and\nerror, I managed to shape one of jigsaw blades into a pick tool that seemed like\nit should do the job. For days, I manipulated it into each of the padlocks. I knew\nI had the principle right, but I still couldn’t get it to work. Blisters formed on my\nthumb and fingers. Then, finally, the Yale sprung open! With each successive\ntry I got better at knowing how to put the blade in, when and where to rotate it\nand how much pressure to apply. After fashioning a half-dozen other tools, each\nslightly different in width and shape, I reached a point where I could get the\nmechanism to work on my first try. Other locks – doors, trunks, closets – were\neven easier after I made picks for them as well.\nI couldn’t resist sharing my newly acquired skill with a couple of the boys in\nmy class, and word gradually spread. There was a handful of slightly older boys\nwho we referred to as the “rogues”. They weren’t delinquents. They were free\nspirits, bridling at the uniform expectations and rules of kibbutz life. Over the\nnext few years, as co-conspirators more than close friends, I found myself\ndrawn to two of them. Ido and Moshe were 18 months older than me. Though\n36\nIdo was just a few inches over five feet, he was strong and athletic, a star even\non the basketball court. Moshe was taller, if a bit overweight. He was nowhere\nnear as strong as Ido, but still stronger than me, and had a streetwise intelligence\nand a sardonic sense of humor. Both had tested the patience of our teachers to\nbreaking point. Ido had been sent off to a vocational school in Netanya. Moshe\nwas moved to Mikveh Israel, a school which focused mostly on agriculture. On\nFriday evenings and Saturdays in the kibbutz, however, they filled their time\nwith a variety of minor misdeeds. My role – the cement in our budding\npartnership – was as designated lock-picker.\nOur first caper targeted the concrete security building near the dining hall. It\ncontained the kibbutz’s store of weapons, with a metal door secured by a\npadlock. Late one Friday night, with Ido and Moshe as lookouts, I crouched in\nfront of the lock and took out my tools. In less than a minute, I had it open. We\ndarted into the storeroom. There were about 80 rifles, along with a few machine\nguns, on racks along the walls. Ido took a rifle from the furthest end of the rack\nand wrapped it in a blanket. Moshe pocketed a box of ammunition. As the\nothers hurried back to our dormitory, I closed the lock, making sure it was in the\nsame position I’d found it, and joined them. The next afternoon, we stole away\nthrough the moshav of Kfar Hayim into a field on the far side. We test-fired the\nrifle until sunset, when we returned to the kibbutz and replaced it in the armory.\nIt felt like the perfect crime: foolproof, since no one was likely to notice\nanything. Essentially harmless. And repeatable, as we confirmed by returning\non Friday nights every month or two.\nThis modest pre-adolescent rebellion never extended to doubting the national\nmission of Israel. Growing up on a kibbutz in a country younger even than we\nwere, we all felt a part of its brief history, and its future. That was especially\ntrue after my kibbutz mentor, Yigal, left for his military service and joined one\nof the Israeli army’s elite units.\nThe 1948 war had been won. But it had not brought peace. Palestinian\nirregulars, fedayeen operating from Jordan and the Gaza Strip, mounted hit-andrun\nraids. In armed ambushes or by planting mines, they killed dozens of Israeli\ncivilians and injured hundreds more. The country was in no mood for another\nwar. The newly created Israeli armed forces – known as Tzahal, a Hebrew\nacronym for the Israeli Defense Force – also seemed to have lost the cutting\nedge, or perhaps the desperate motivation, of the pre-state militias. At first, Ben-\nGurion relied on young recruits in the new army’s infantry brigades to counter\nthe fedayeen attacks. Nearly 90 reprisal operations were launched in 1952 and\n37\nearly 1953. Nearly all ended with the soldiers failing to reach their target or\ntaking casualties. Sometimes both.\nBy mid-1953, the army decided to set up Israel’s first dedicated commando\nforce. It was called Unit 101. It was led by a 25-year-old named Ariel Sharon,\nwho had been a platoon commander in 1948. With Ben-Gurion and especially\nhis army chief-of-staff, Moshe Dayan, determined to hit back hard at the\nfedayeen attacks, Sharon took a few dozen hand-picked soldiers and began\nmounting a different kind of retaliatory attacks. The largest, in October 1953,\nwas in response to the murder of a woman and her two children in their home in\ncentral Israel. It was against the West Bank village of Qibya. Sharon and his\ncommandos surrounded and attacked the village, destroying homes and other\nbuildings – and killing at least 40 villagers sheltering inside them. Israel\nimmediately came under international condemnation, accused of allowing its\ntroops to unleash a massacre. Unit 101 was disbanded. It lasted just half a year.\nBut that was not because of Qibya. While realizing the importance of avoiding\ncivilian casualties, Dayan remained convinced that only units like 101 offered\nany realistic hope of taking the fight to the fedayeen. He made Unit 101 the core\nof a larger commando force merged into Battalion 890 of the paratroopers’\nbrigade, and he put Sharon in overall command.\nIt was this force that Yigal Garber joined. He became part of its elite\ncommando team, Company A and took part in a series of attacks on the West\nBank and in Gaza. While avoiding a repeat of Qibya, they inflicted heavy\ncasualties on Jordanian and Egyptian army and police units, and also suffered\ncasualties of their own. Battalion 890 was based just a couple of miles from\nMishmar Hasharon and Yigal returned to the kibbutz every few weeks. He\nnever talked about the commando operations. But every time there was a report\nof Israelis killed in a fedayeen attack, I knew there would be a retaliation raid,\nwith my Yigal almost certainly involved and, I hoped, returning unscathed.\nHe did. And in 1956, two years into his military service, he was part of\nIsrael’s second full-scale war. For a while, the reprisal attacks seemed to be\nworking. The fedayeen attacks decreased. But that didn’t last, especially in the\nsouth along the border with Gaza. Egypt’s pro-Western monarchy had been\ntoppled in a coup organized by a group of army officers led by a stridently pan-\nArabist – and anti-Israeli – lieutenant colonel named Gamal Abdel Nasser.\nEgypt began providing not just tacit support for the fedayeen in Gaza, but\narming and training them and helping organize cross-border attacks. Then, in\n38\nthe summer of 1956, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, which had been\nowned by the British and French.\nBen-Gurion was emboldened to go war by the fact that both Britain and\nFrance wanted to retake the canal. Under an agreement reached beforehand,\nIsrael was to begin the hostilities, after which the British and French would\nenter under the guise of separating Israeli and Egyptian forces. Ben-Gurion’s\nhope was to end the threat of fedayeen strikes, at least in the south, by taking\ncontrol both of Gaza and the enormous natural buffer afforded by the Sinai\nDesert. Militarily, it went to plan. On October 29, 1956, Yigal and other\nparatroopers from Battalion 890 were dropped deep into the Sinai. They landed\nnear the entrance to the Mitla Pass, a sinuous route between two lines of craggy\nhills 25 miles from the canal. British and French air strikes began three days\nlater. Nasser pulled most of his forces back across the canal. By early\nNovember, Israel was in control of Gaza and the whole of the Sinai.\nPolitically, however, Ben-Gurion and his European partners had\ncatastrophically miscalculated. Britain and France were fading imperial powers.\nThe balance of power after the Second World War rested with America and the\nSoviet Union. Both were furious over the obviously pre-arranged seizure of\nSinai, Gaza and the canal. It took a while for the message to sink in. In a speech\nto the Knesset after the conquest was complete, Ben-Gurion declared the post-\n1948 armistice null and void, and said Israel would never again allow “foreign\nforces” to control the territory it had captured.\nA few days later, however, he had no choice but to deliver a different\nmessage in a radio address to the country. He had at least managed to secure a\nconcession with the help of the Americans. The Sinai and Gaza would be placed\nunder supervision of a UN force. He also got a US assurance of Israel’s right of\npassage through the Straits of Tiran to the Red Sea, and an agreement that if the\nEgyptians blocked Israeli shipping we would have the right to respond. But he\nannounced that we would be leaving every inch of territory taken in the war. By\nearly 1957, we did so. The one lasting gain came in Gaza. On their way out,\nIsraeli troops destroyed the fedayeen’s military installations, and cross-border\nattacks from the south ceased.\nUnlike in 1948, the Sinai War touched me directly. I never felt Israel’s\nexistence was in danger. The fighting was brief and far away. But Mishmar\nHasharon had a small role in the war plan. Ben-Gurion and Dayan were\nconcerned that the co-ordinated attack might lead to a wider war, with the\npossibility that Egyptian warplanes might get involved as they had in 1948.\n39\nAmong the precautions they took was to base several hundred reservists from\nthe Alexandroni Brigade in a defensive position near the Mediterranean: the\neucalyptus grove at the top end of our kibbutz, where the cover was so dense\nthey were all but invisible from the air.\nWe kids seized on the chance to talk to the reservists. I can’t remember\nwhether it was Ido or Moshe who noticed an area at the back of their\nencampment, on the other side of the kibbutz cemetery, where neatly stacked\nboxes of munitions were being kept. But we spent the next several afternoons\non reconnaissance. A soldier was always on guard. But there were times the\narea was unwatched, either when one guard handed over to the next, or on their\ncigarette breaks.\nWe struck the following Friday. Nowadays, the cemetery consists of a halfdozen\nrows of headstones. Walking through it, as I still do at least once each\nyear, is like revisiting my past. Almost all the grown-ups I remember from my\nchildhood now rest there, including my parents. My father died in 2002, at the\nage of 92. My mother passed away only a few years ago, a few weeks after her\n100 th birthday. But in 1956, the cemetery was tiny. The chances of anyone being\nthere at midnight on a Friday were close to zero. Crouching in the shadow of the\nheadstones, we could see the guard. We waited until he left for his break. Each\nof us took a wooden box and one of the slightly larger metal boxes. Inside, we\nfound a treasure trove: thousands of bullets for all kinds of weapons. The metal\ncases held heavier firepower: grenades and mortars. We returned those. We\nwere mischievous, but not crazy. Yet each of us now had a crate full of\nammunition, even including belts for machine guns.\n* * *\nMy experience at school began to change in my early teenage years as well.\nShortly before my fourteen birthday, our age group was sent to a school outside\nMishmar Hasharon. The kibbutz had decided that since there were only a\ndozen-or-so children in each class, it wasn’t economically viable to provide a\nquality education. They sent us to the regional high school.\nIt was several hundred yards down the road in the direction of Tel Aviv. It\nwas far more rigorous. I was no longer the only kid in my class who liked to\nread or could do math problems in his head. It was there I first got truly\n40\ninterested in science. When I came across concepts I couldn’t understand, our\nteachers always seemed able to answer my questions or help me find the\nanswers myself. I liked the school enormously. I might well have gone on to\nfinish my secondary education there. I probably should have. But the next year,\nthe kibbutz brought us back again.\nOne of the considerations was financial. Like many kibbutzim, Mishmar\nHasharon concluded that in order to make its school more economically\nsustainable it would take in a number of “outside children” – yeldei chutz –\nfrom towns and settlements around Israel. Yet this latest policy change was also\ntriggered a debate over the kind of education kibbutzim should provide. Should\na kibbutz school offer a curriculum tailored to passing the bagrut, the\nmatriculation exam, and going on to university? Or should it limit itself to a\nfairly basic education geared to developing the talents needed for a productive\nlife on the kibbutz? In a series of heated debates in the dining hall, almost all of\nMishmar Hasharon supported the model of a basic, kibbutz-oriented education.\nMy father was the leading voice among the dissenters, and though it seemed\nobvious he was fighting an uphill battle, I remember feeling a sense of pride at\nwatching him – and an echo in my own impulse to reach my own judgment\nabout issues and to act on it as I was growing older. Not only was he opposed to\nthe new policy. He was aghast. In the only time I can recall his speaking out at\none of the weekly kibbutz meetings, he asked how Mishmar Hasharon could\ntake upon itself the right to constrain an individual child’s life potential. “We\nare Jews!” he said. “We are people who have left our impact on history through\nour scholars, not our peasants. I can’t understand how we, who came here to\nopen a new chapter in the history of our people, can choose to keep our sons\nand daughters from studying. We should encourage them to study!” He\naccepted that the interests of the kibbutz mattered. But what kind of “model\nsociety” would we be creating if we chose to “doom our own children to\nignorance, and cut them off from the great forward momentum of history in\nIsrael and the whole world?”\nEspecially in a kibbutz, however, the majority ruled. In this case, it was\nnearly unanimous, my mother included. I could see she felt torn, whether\nbecause she agreed with my father or because she realized how deeply he felt.\nBut she accepted the decision. For her, that was what was meant by being part\nof the larger kibbutz family. Still, my father didn’t give up. He couldn’t change\nthe kibbutz’s ruling. But he tried to get me to stay at the regional high school. A\ncouple of years earlier, examiners had fanned out across Israel to administer its\n41\nfirst aptitude tests. I finished among the top two dozen results in the country.\n“How can you throw your gifts away? For what,” he asked me. “If you leave\nthat school, and give up on going to university, it will be like betraying\nyourself.” At one point, he walked me out to the patch of hard-packed soil\nwhere we parked the tractors and farm machinery. “What do you want to do\nwith your life,” he asked. “Do you want to be a farmer?”\nI thought about it before answering. “I don’t know what will happen in the\nfuture,” I said. “But if you ask me now, I would say I want to drive one of the\nkibbutz trucks.”\nI could see the shock and disappointment in his eyes. But it was the truth. I\ndid imagine that at some point I might want to make a life outside the kibbutz.\nBut I’d never lived anywhere else. If I was going to remain a part of it, I could\nthink of no better way than to join our little corps of drivers. Though they lived\non the kibbutz, they spent most of their time delivering or picking up goods in\nplaces like Tel Aviv, Holon or Ashkelon. As the US Marines might have put it,\nI guess I figured I’d join the truck-drivers and see the world.\nThe deeper reason I said no to my father, as I am sure he suspected, was that\nI felt a need to take control of my own life. That was simply a part of growing\nup, a process which probably happened more quickly for 1950s kibbutz children\nthan for town or city kids. We loved and respected our parents. But we were\nliving with other teenagers. We weren’t just residents of the kibbutz. We were\npart of the economic collective, working in the fields or orchards, the garage\nand the metal shop. This bred a sense of independence. I listened to my father’s\narguments. But this was a decision about my future. I felt I had to make it for\nmyself. I cared about my education. But I’d reached a stage where my life\noutside the classroom, and my circle of friends, mattered more. I am sure that\nthe same impulse drove me in my continuing freelance forays into lockpicking\nand petty larceny with Ido and Moshe.\nSo I returned to the kibbutz school. The level of teaching was nowhere near\nthe regional school’s. But we did begin studying new subjects like economics\nand politics. There were two other welcome surprises as well. The first was the\narrival of a new history teacher. Knowledgable, enthusiastic and eloquent, he\nhad a rare gift for igniting excitement in his students. We studied the French\nRevolution. He brought it to life with insights into Montesquieu, Rousseau and\nJohn Locke, Louis XVI and Mary Antoinette, Robespierre and Napoleon. He\ntraced the dynamics that led to the revolution, and the way its ideals descended\ninto the bloodshed and terror that followed. He presented history as a human\n42\nprocess that raised as many questions as it answered, as something we could\nlearn from.\nThe second high-point was a couple named David and Leah Zimmerman.\nThough Mishmar Hasharon, like other kibbutzim, was secular, they introduced\nus to the Talmud, the ancient compendium of rabbinic discussion and debate on\nthe meaning of passages from the Bible. We focused on two tractates, Baba\nKama and Baba Metziah, in which the rabbis drew on verses from Exodus to\nargue out a system of rules for resolving civil disputes. It was the Talmud of\ntorts. The intricacy and the depth of the rabbinical debate fascinated me.\n* * *\nYigal returned from the army a few months after the 1956 war, when, like\nother teenagers, I was about to enter a pre-military program known as Gadna.\nThere were several options kids could choose. One was linked to the air force,\nanother to the navy. But most of us joined the reconnaissance and scouting\ngroup, Gadna Sayerim. It involved studying topography and navigation, as well\nas field exercises that were a lot like the ones Yigal had put us through a few\nyears earlier. At year’s end, we took part in a national exercise. It was called, a\nbit grandiosely, Miyam el Yam: from sea to sea. We had to find our way from\nthe Mediterranean, near Haifa, across northern Israel to a lake which was a sea\nonly in name, the Sea of Galilee. It lasted three days. We were placed in teams\nof four. We were each given a topographical map and a compass, with\nlandmarks marked along the way which we had to find and draw in a notebook\nto prove we’d been there.\nA couple of hours in, we faced our first challenge. We were making our way\nalong a shepherds’ trail, with brush and bramble on either side, when the path\nsplit in two. We had to decide which fork to take. The map didn’t help. Each\ninch covered the equivalent of a mile-and-a-half. The key was to be able to\nmatch it with what we were seeing around us. To use points we could identify\nfrom the map – Haifa and the sea in the receding distance, and a taller hill to our\nnortheast – and then figure out which path was more likely to take us in the\nright direction. I knew this mix of calculation and imagination was something I\nenjoyed. But it was more than that. Each of us had had the same preparation for\nthe exercise. As my trek-mates turned to me for this first decision, and then on\n43\neach successive stage as we crossed the Galilee, I realized that it was also\nsomething that I was naturally good at.\nStill, the closest thing to real military activity remained my excurions with\nIdo and Moshe. Our ammunition trunks were stowed under our beds. But the\nfinal piece of our arsenal fell into place in May 1958. For the tenth anniversary\nof Israel, there was a national exhibition celebrating the achievements of the\nstate. I paid a first visit on my own. I was curious to see what was on show. But\nas I walked through, I couldn’t help noticing the lack of security. Two days\nlater, I returned with Ido and Moshe. There was a stand devoted to the Israeli\nmilitary industry. We already had a supply of ammunition for an Uzi\nsubmachine gun, courtesy of our raid on the Alexandroni Brigade. Now, when\nthe guy in charge of the stand was chatting with other visitors, we came away\nwith an Uzi.\nIt was then the trouble began. Along with Ido, Moshe and the other older\nboys, I now lived in a larger dormitory under the cursory gaze of an older\nmetapelet. She was doing routine cleaning when she decided to dust around the\nboxes under our beds. She’d never given them much thought. But when she\ntried to move one of them, she was amazed by its weight. She got one her sonsin-law\nto help. I think the box he pried open first was Moshe’s. But within a few\nminutes he’d opened Ido’s and mine as well. Inside each were hundreds of\nbullets and the machine-gun belts. Inside mine was our prized Uzi. It would not\nexactly have taken the KGB to work out the rest. The kibbutz leaders ordered an\ninquiry. Ido was summoned first, and attempted a brief show of defiance.\n“What’s the big deal,” he asked. “It’s just stuff we collected. Why should you\ncare?” But separately questioning Moshe, then Ido again, the inquisitors worked\nout every detail. The fact that the ammunition had come from the Alexandroni\nBrigade, the reservists sent to defend us, was bad enough. But the Uzi had been\nstolen from the National Exhibition. That was even worse. It was left to the core\nof young men in their late 20s and 30s to figure out how to punish us. Everyone\nagreed we could not be reported to the police. That would risk a scandal for the\nkibbutz. They decided to beat some sense into the offenders, in front of all the\nrest of the teenagers in the dormitory.\nI wasn’t there. One afternoon each week, I now boarded a bus into Tel Aviv\nfor my piano lesson. But when I returned after sundown, I sensed immediately\nsomething was wrong. Yigal was waiting at the bus stop outside the kibbutz. He\ntold me that what I had done was terrible. Not just because it involved weapons,\nbut because it was a breach of trust. Did you really steal ammunition from the\n44\narmy, he asked, his voice rising. And from the National Exhibition? I didn’t\nbother denying it. I suppose I felt lucky they hadn’t found out about our raids on\nthe kibbutz armory. He did not administer my beating. That came a few weeks\nlater from one of the kibbutz elders. He simply took me by the shoulders and\nshouted: “You must never do this again.”\nIt was worse for my parents. At first, they believed I was an innocent party.\nThey were convinced I couldn’t have got involved in something like this\nwithout being dragged in by the others. My father even asked me whether the\nreason I’d been “drafted” by Ido and Moshe was because I was small, and able\nto squeeze through tight spaces in windows and doors. As it happened, that did\nsometimes come in handy. But I told them, no, I was not an unlucky bystander.\nI was as much a part of it as the others. My father was angrier than I had ever\nseen him. My mother, faced with what must have seemed like a betrayal of\nevery one of her Zionist principles, told me that if the kibbutz had decided to\nreport us to the police, she would not have objected.\nTheir mood lifted slightly when I began my final year of high school in\nSeptember 1958. After two years back in the kibbutz school, our age-group was\nsent out again in another shift in policy. This one was in response to signs of\ngrowing support in Mishmar Hasharon and other kibbutzim for the argument\nmy father had made against the quality of education we were offering. In order\nto go at least some way toward meeting that objection, Mishmar Hasharon was\nbanding together with two dozen other kibbutzim and sending all 12 th -graders to\none of two outside high schools. The first, called Beit Berl, was a Labor Zionist\ninstitution focusing on the humanities. In addition to a few of the less academic\nboys, most of the girls were sent there. The rest of us went to a place called\nRupin. It was a few hundred yards past the regional high school. It specialized\nin agriculturally related scientific research.\nA few of the teachers were enormously gifted, and they were in the areas\nthat most interested me: math, physics and biology. Yet the rest of the\ncurriculum was almost numbingly uninspiring. I did not miss a single math or\nscience class. But otherwise, I began setting my own schedule. Some days, I\nwould sleep late, or not go at all. When I did go, I’d often show up without\nhaving done the homework. Neither Ido nor Moshe was with me at Rupin. They\nwere starting their military service. But I assembled a new band of mischiefmakers,\nand it was not hard to entice them to go AWOL.\nI was warned several times by the school administrator. He said he could not\naccommodate a student who seemed oblivious to, or dismissive of, the rules. He\n45\nwas especially upset because my attitude seemed to be infecting others. A few\nmonths into the school year, he told the leaders of Mishmar Hasharon, and then\nmy parents, that I would have to leave. My father was especially upset. A\ncouple of years earlier, he’d had visions of my staying on in the regional high\nschool and going to university. Now, I’d been unable to hold my own in Rupin.\nStill, both he and my mother were relieved when Mishmar Hasharon and the\nschool worked out a compromise which did not end my studies altogether. The\nexpulsion stood, but I was allowed to continue attending math and science\nclasses.\nFor my mother, the blow was softened by the fact I began working almost\nfull-time on the kibbutz, alongside Yigal, driving a tractor. I woke up early and\naccompanied him into the fields of wheat, barley or rye. We also made a series\nof trips 130 miles south into the Negev to a moshav called Patish. It had been\nset up by newly arrived Moroccan Jews. Since they didn’t have the equipment\nor know-how to cultivate all their fields, they were renting out some of the land.\nMishmar Hasharon had contracted to farm a parcel of 450 acres.\nFor ten days at a time, Yigal and I would place a tractor on the back of a\npickup and head to Patish. We worked from four in the morning until sundown.\nAfter work, we ate at a tiny family-run restaurant a few miles away in Ofakim, a\nso-called “development town” populated by Moroccan Jews who had been\nmoved there as soon as they arrived in Israel. Far from regretting not being in\nschool, I drew satisfaction, and pride, from knowing that I was functioning as an\nindependent adult. But it also gave me time to think. My whole life had been\ncircumscribed by the struggle to create and secure the state. But I again found\nmyself pondering issues of basic fairness in our young country, and the\nchallenge of reconciling our words and principles with our deeds amid the\ndifficult realities of building the state.\nBack on the kibbutz, it was the example of the kindly and hard-working\nBaddura which had caused me to question how we were treating the Jews who\nhad arrived from Yemen. In the Negev, I met members of the even larger postwar\ninflux from Morocco. One image struck me above all. It was from the place\nYigal and I ate dinner. Ofakim was a development town that had yet to develop.\nIt had no visible means of support, and there was no sign the government was\ndoing much to remedy that or integrate the new immigrants economically and\nsocially. The “restaurant” was a side business a family had set up in the dining\nroom of their tiny home. The sixth or seventh time we went there, I was startled\nby sudden movement a couple of feet away from where we were sitting.\n46\nLooking more closely, I saw a wooden box, the kind we used in Mishmar\nHasharon to crate oranges. It was filled with hay. At first, I thought the stirring\ninside was a family pet. Then, I saw it was a baby. I said nothing until we had\nleft. “Was that really a child?” I asked Yigal. “A baby?” He replied, with a tinge\nof sadness but also a look that seemed to convey surprise at my naivety: “Yes.\nThey don’t have room for him.”\n* * *\nMy evolving feelings about the Arabs, the other people with dreams of what\nthey still saw as Palestine, would become more complex as my childhood drew\nto an end. As mentioned, I barely registered the fate of the absent villagers of\nWadi Khawaret.\nAnd yet as I got older – in my teens – I came to understand why the\nPalestinians were fighting us. Before the 1956 war, Dayan gave a brief speech\nthat had a powerful impact on me. It was a eulogy, but it was for someone\nDayan didn’t know personally. His intended audience was the rest of the\ncountry. He spoke in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza often\ntargeted by fedayeen. In April 1956, a group of Arabs crossed from Gaza and\nbegan cutting down the wheat in Nahal Oz’s fields. The kibbutz security officer,\na 21-year-old named Roi Rotberg, rode out on horseback to chase them away.\nThe intruders opened fire as soon as he got close. They beat him, shot him dead\nand took the body back over the armistice line. The corpse was returned,\nmutilated, after an Israeli protest through the UN.\nWith Israeli newspapers full of agonized accounts of what had happened,\nDayan’s message was that we should not blame the Arabs for Roi Rotberg’s\ndeath. We should look at ourselves, and the neighborhood in which we lived.\n“Why should we talk about their burning hatred for us?” he asked. “For eight\nyears, they have been sitting in the refugee camps of Gaza, while before their\neyes we have been transforming the lands and the villages where they and their\nfathers dwelt.” Of course, they hated us and the state we were building. Rotberg\nhad allowed his “yearning for peace to deafen his ears, and he did not hear the\nvoice of murder waiting in ambush.” Dayan said the danger was that other\nIsraelis had become similarly naive. “How did we shut our eyes, and refuse to\nsee, in all its brutality, the destiny of our generation?” A generation which was\n47\nsettling the land but which, “without the steel helmet and the barrel of the gun,\nwill not succeed in planting a tree or building a home.”\nStill, if I was part of a generation that understood the need for military\npreparedness, strength and a readiness to fight if we were to survive in the\nMiddle East, the 1956 war also brought home to me the need to consider how\nwe fought. This meant grappling with a contradiction wired into Zionism from\nthe start: the need to take up arms to defend our state, while recognizing the\nJewish moral code that was its foundation. When the Israeli armed forces were\nestablished in 1948, Tzahal’s doctrine included the principle of tohar haneshek\n– “purity of arms” – and an explicit requirement for our soldiers to use the\nminimum necessary force and do all they could to avoid civilian casualties.\nPutting “purity of arms” into practice was always going to be hard. All arms\nkill. In all wars, civilians die. But that did not make the principle, or the need to\nbe aware of it in combat, any less important.\nEven if the soldier called on the make that judgment was someone who had\nmentored me from the time I was six, and whose military prowess I had come to\nrespect. Even if it was Yigal Garber. His parachute jump on the first day of the\n1956 war went smoothly. But the battle for control of the Mitla Pass turned out\nto be the most deadly of the war. It was also unnecessary. Under Israel’s prewar\nchoreography with the British and French, the very fact of our landing near\nthe Mitla Pass was to be the trigger for an Anglo-French attack. In fact, Arik\nSharon, the commander of Battalion 890, received orders from Tel Aviv not to\ntake the pass. Only grudgingly, did they let him send in a reconnaissance force\nto establish whether it was safe to cross.\nThe reconnaissance company walked into a trap. Machine-gun and mortar\nfire rained down from Egyptian troops dug into the caves and other natural\ndefensive positions above the pass. It took hours to extricate the stranded men.\nYigal’s unit fought its way in from the eastern side of the pass. A small group\nfrom the reconnaissance force managed to get a foothold on the western side.\nAlmost 250 Egyptians were killed. But 38 Israeli paratroopers also died, the\nlargest single toll in any battle since 1948. Battered and bitter, the surviving\nmen from the reconnaissance force parachuted into the southernmost part of the\nSinai, near Et-Tur on the Red Sea. Yigal and the others headed overground to\njoin up with them. By the time they got there, Egyptian resistance had all but\nended. Yigal’s company had a brief exchange of fire with several dozen holdouts\nin the Egyptian force. The Egyptians surrendered. And then, apparently,\nYigal and his fellow paratroopers shot all of them dead.\n48\nAt least those were the rumors after the war. I asked friends what they were\nhearing. I asked some of the older men on the kibbutz, my father included. All\nof them responded with a slightly different version of events. But I knew what I\nwasn’t hearing. No one of them told me it was a lie. When I asked Yigal, he\naverted my glance, and then changed the subject. I knew it was true, at least\nbroadly.\nI realized that, before it happened, Yigal and the others had seen dozens of\nfriends gunned down in an Egyptian ambush in the Mitla Pass. But I didn’t need\na lesson tohar haneshek to know that the killing of captured Egyptian soldiers\nshould not have happened. Or that it was plainly, simply wrong.\nWhen Yigal and I made our final trip to Patish in 1959, I knew it would be\npointless to ask him about it. Whatever he said wouldn’t change anything. I still\nrespected his courage and his fighting spirit, and the part he’d played in\ndefending Israel. I appreciated what he’d done for me as I grew up. But what\nmattered now wasn’t what Yigal had done. It was what I would do, and how I\nwould live my life.\nEspecially since I, too, was about to begin my army service.\n49\nChapter Three\nI reported for induction on the second Sunday of November 1959, three\nmonths short of my eighteenth birthday. Military service was a near-universal\nrite of passage for Israeli teenagers. For children of the kibbutz, it held even\ngreater significance. Now that we had a country, the kibbutzniks’ role as the\navant-garde in taming and farming the land had ceased to be relevant. But the\nsense of mission we’d been raised with – what we were led to believe set us\napart from the mere “city-dwellers” – drove us to aspire, maybe even assume,\nwe would leave an imprint in other spheres of the new state’s life. I doubt it’s an\naccident that nearly every one of the boys with whom I grew up in Mishmar\nHasharon went on to become an officer during his time in the military.\nJudging from my own first few weeks in uniform, however, there was every\nreason to believe I would end up as an unfortunate, undistinguished exception.\nThis was not due to lack of ambition. In fact, I thought at first of joining the\nair force. But a question on the application form asked whether I ever suffered\nfrom any breathing discomfort. Like almost everyone on the kibbutz, I did get a\nbit clogged up when the weather turned cold and damp. So I naively answered\nyes, ending any chance of training as a pilot. My fallback choice was a tank\nunit. But when I joined the hundreds of other draftees at the processing center\nnear Tel Aviv, about a hundred of us were shunted, by alphabetical lottery, into\ntraining for armored personnel carriers instead. Known as battle taxis, the APCs\nwhich Israel had at the time were lumbering, World War Two-vintage\nhalftracks.\nOur training battalion was based, alongside the country’s main armored\nbrigade, in a huge, hillside army camp outside Beersheva in the Negev. I knew\nthat our tironut – basic training – would be tough. That was the whole point.\nBut we endured a seemingly endless array of inspections, under the watchful\neye of a corporal who meted out punishments for the tiniest scuff on a boot, a\nbelt, or a rifle. The rest of the time was spent in physical training, which I found\nespecially hard, at least at the beginning. I still weighed barely 130 pounds, and\nby no means all, or even most, of it was muscle. My military career, such as it\nwas, looked very likely to involve spending my required couple of years baking\ninside an APC in the Negev before moving on to something more useful, and\ncertainly more fulfilling, with the rest of my life.\n50\nBut a series of accidents, in Israel’s life and in mine, would soon point me in\na dramatically different direction. The first became known as the Rotem Crisis,\nand it delivered a jolting reminder of Israel’s vulnerability to a surprise attack\nfrom neighboring Arab states. Militarily, we were far stronger than in 1948. But\nwe were still a young country, at an early stage in our economic development.\nOur defense strategy rested on a recognition we could not afford to sustain a\nlarge standing army, relying instead on a pool of trained reservists. The problem\nwas that a full call-up of the reserves would require something like 48 hours.\nThat meant some form of early warning was critical.\nRotem erupted in February 1960, about halfway through my tironut, and\nbegan almost farcically. The Chief of Military Intelligence, Chaim Herzog, was\nat a diplomatic receiption in Tel Aviv when he began chatting with a guest he\nknew well: the head of the local CIA station. What, the American asked, did he\nmake of the fact that Egypt had moved its two main armored divisions into the\nSinai, toward the border with Israel? Herzog came up with a suitably woolly\nreply, about how it was obviously a situation which bore watching. But the truth\nwas that neither he nor anyone else in Israel had any idea about the Egyptian\nmobilization. He left the party as soon as he could, to tell Dayan and Ben-\nGurion. When a reconnaissance flight the next day confirmed that dozens of\nbattle-ready tanks had been rolled forward toward the Suez Canal, Ben-Gurion\nand the generals scrambled for a response.\nThey did not want a war. Ben-Gurion was particularly worried that in\nresponding to Nasser’s buildup, he might inadvertently escalate things further.\nHe vetoed the idea of a full mobilization. But he did order a more limited callup,\nof about 7,000 reservists. He placed the air force on alert. He directed the\nfour brigades responsible for the defense of southern Israel, including our\narmored brigade near Beersheva, to move within a few miles of the border –\nand gave us the additional role of sending several overnight munitions convoys\nto equip the hastily assembled border force.\nThe first sign I saw that anything extraordinary was going on was the sudden\nmovement of tanks and APCs inside our camp. At first, no one told us raw\nrecruits anything. We were left to look on, and stay out of the way. But with our\noperational units preparing to move forward, the problem was that there seemed\nno one else with the expertise, experience and local knowledge to lead the\nsupply columns. So our training battalion was summoned before the platoon\ncommander. “Any volunteers,” he asked. When none of us raised a hand, he\nsaid: “Come on. One of you must have grown up around here. That means the\n51\nfirst 25 miles will be familiar territory.” He left unspoken the obvious\npostscript: the need to negotiate the final five to ten miles, through open desert,\nand to find the right area, on our side of a border that wasn’t even marked.\n“Can’t any of you,” he barked, “lead a convoy of a few dozen trucks?”\nI’m not sure what possessed me. But I thought to myself: yes, I probably\ncan. I had been scouting and navigating in one way or another since those first\nevenings with Yigal in the kibbutz orchards. I’d trained with Gadna Sayerim.\nAnd while I’d never lived in the south, the farm settlement of Patish, where I’d\nworked along with Yigal after getting kicked out of high school, was not far\nfrom the route the conveys would have to take.\nSo I raised my hand.\n“Can you lead a convoy?” he asked.\n“Yes, sir,” I said. “Of course, I’ll need a map. And a compass.”\n“Why do you think you’re qualified?” he prodded. I’d been in Gadna\nSayerim, I said. I was good with maps. “Okay,” he replied, and he sent me,\nalong with two of the company’s junior officers, to the battalion commander.\nSomeone must have phoned ahead, because he was clearly expecting us.\nStill, I could see the surprise in his eyes when he looked at me: only just\neighteen, but looking closer to 15, my uniform sagging on my slender frame. He\ngazedat the officers, then back at me, then at the officers again, as if trying to\nfigure out whether he was about to approve something utterly crazy. But he had\nlittle choice. Three convoys had to be dispatched within the next couple of\nhours. So far, with me, he had a sum total of one guy to lead them. “Fine,” he\nsaid, and waved us out.\nThe column consisted of eight huge, American-made six-wheelers, each\npacked with ten tons of munitions and other supplies. I was in the lead truck.\nThe driver was a reservist in his mid-30s. So were most of the men in the rest of\nthe transport trucks, one driver and one soldier in each. A staff sergeant, in the\nsecond vehicle, was in theoretical command. But, surreal though it felt, I was\nactually in charge, since I was the only person who might, conceivably, get us\nto the right place.\nThe platoon commander was right. The first part, on paved roads, was fairly\neasy. But just before sunset, we reached open desert, the beginning of more than\nthree hours of picking and weaving, calibrating and recalibrating, our way\nacross a wide expanse on sand and occasional scrub bushes that, every mile or\n52\nso, would suddenly give way to a windswept series of dunes and wadis. The\nmap and compass helped. But I soon realized that it was almost impossible to\nget an accurate reading from inside the truck. Every few minutes, I waved the\nconvoy to stop, got out, and walked fifty or sixty yards into the sand and clumps\nof acacia trees and calibrated our progress from there. My fallback was the\nstars. From them, I could at least make sure we were headed in broadly the right\ndirection. But the need to navigate around the dunes meant we were never\nmoving in a perfectly straight line. The miles ticking by on the truck’s odometer\ncouldn’t tell me exactly how far we’d travelled. A couple of times, I realized we\nwere wandering off line – not by a much, but enough to risk leaving us either a\nmile or two south of where we were supposed to go or, worse, on the Egyptian\nside of an unmarked desert frontier that, especially at night, would look pretty\nmuch the same on either side.\nFinally, a few hours before dawn, I brought the convoy to a halt. I climbed\nout, walked back to the staff sergeant and told him, with more confidence than I\nfelt: “We’re here.” I had no way of knowing for sure. But I felt we were\ngenerally in the right place. Before we’d set off, I was briefed by the officer in\ncharge of one of the operational APC battalions. He had been to the area before,\non training exercises. Because of the emergency call-up, he was too senior to\nlead a supply convoy. But he told me that once we got there, we should stop and\nwait. He would follow our tracks the next morning and link up with us. An hour\nafter sunrise, we saw his jeep bobbing over the sand towards us. He pulled to a\nstop, shook hands with the staff sergeant, and then he turned to me.\n“Unbelievable,” he said. “We’re where we need to be.”\nOur role in the grand scheme of things, and certainly mine, was hardly\ndecisive. But the rest of the border mobilization also went to plan. That, along\nwith some frantic diplomatic activity and a healthy common sense on all sides,\nensured that a new war with Egypt was averted – at least for a further halfdozen\nyears, until 1967. By then, the lesson of Rotem would be learned: our\nneed to find a realiable way to tap into the battle plans of the hostile Arab states\naround us. And through another wholly unexpected turn of events starting just a\nfew weeks after the Rotem Crisis, I would turn out to play a personal role in\nmaking that happen.\n* * *\n53\nUnder army regulations, training recruits got a five-day leave every few\nmonths during tironut. My first one came a bit later than usual, due to Rotem.\nBut in April 1960, shortly before the Passover holiday, I headed back to\nMishmar Hasharon. Despite my minor triumph of desert navigation, I still had\nevery reason to believe I’d be spending the next couple of years in an APC unit\nin the Negev, and can’t pretend I was looking forward to it. Still, the idea of\nreturning home in my army uniform, at least a bit stronger and bulkier than\nbefore, did give me a sense of pride.\nIt was on my third day back, when I was in the dining hall with a half-dozen\nschoolmates-turned-soldiers, that Avraham Ramon sat down and joined us. He\nwas a yeled chutz, one of the “boys from outside” who had joined our class\nwhen we were taken out of the regional high school. He, too, was now in the\narmy. As we were finishing lunch, he asked me: “How’s tironut?”\n“Tough,” I said. “Boring.”\nSmiling, he said: “How would you feel about joining a sayeret?”\nThe question took me by surprise. In Hebrew, sayeret meant “reconnaissance\nunit”. It was the name given to special units that carried out missions behind\nenemy lines, or under particularly exacting conditions. In the early 1960s, there\nwere only two of note. One was Sayeret Golani, attached to the Golani Brigade\nnear the northern border. The truly elite one was Sayeret Tzanhanim, the\nparatroopers’ sayeret. It had been built from Company A of Battalion 890,\nwhere Yigal had served in the 1950s.\n“Which sayeret?” I asked.\n“It’s called Sayeret Matkal,” he replied.\nI’d never heard of it. When I asked what it did, he said: “I’m not allowed to\nsay. But are you interested?” The air of mystery made it seem only more\nenticing. And no matter what it did, it had to be a step up from what lay ahead\nof me in the Negev. “Yeah. Sure,” I replied.\nI heard nothing further in the days after I got back to Beersheva. But at the\nend of the month, I was ordered to report to a small hut in an army base near Tel\nAviv. It belonged to Maka Esser, the personnel department of military\nintelligence. I was greeted by two men in their late 20s. One of them, shorter\neven than me, introduced himself as Sami Nachmias. The other was tall and\nslim and said in a surprisingly quiet voice: “I’m Shmil Ben-Zvi.” They were\ntwo names which I, like most Israeli teenagers at the time, knew well. Ben-Zvi\n54\nhad been an officer in Arik Sharon’s original Unit 101, and Nachmias was one\nof the earliest recruits to Company A. They shook my hand and motioned me\ninto a Jeep. As we drove out of the base, they peppered me with questions about\nalmost anything except the army: the kibbutz, school, sports. Then, Ben-Zvi\npulled the Jeep to the side of the road, turned around to face me and asked: “Is it\ntrue you can pick locks?”\nYes, I said. “Do you want me to show you?” He said that wouldn’t be\nnecessary.\n“Is it true you can navigate? Read maps?” Nachmias asked. I said yes.\nThey drove me back to the base in silence. “OK,” Nachmias said. “You’ll\nprobably hear from us.”\nI didn’t. But as basic training was winding down, I got a further order: to\nreport to an address in Tzahala, a neighborhood in north Tel Aviv where a lot of\nmilitary officers lived. It was a small house with a metal gate outside. I was met\nat the door by a man about 30 in shorts and a T-shirt who introduced himself as\nAvraham Arnan. He led me inside. He unfurled a map of Jerusalem and the\nsurrounding hills. He pointed to a spot on the southwest of the city. He drew a\nwide, curving line through the hills to a second point. “You know how to read a\nmap?” he asked. When I nodded, he said: “I want you to describe to me – just as\nif you were walking on this line – exactly what you see, as you make your way\nto the place I marked.” I used the elevation lines on the map as a guide, and the\npositioning of the hills and woodland and villages on the map, and began\ndescribing how each stage would look. When I was finished, his only response\nwas the hint of a smile. When he spoke, it wasn’t about the map. It was, again,\nabout picking locks. “How did you learn?” he asked. I explained how I’d cut\ninto the locks, figured out how they worked and made a set of tools to open\nthem. “Thank you,” he said. “You can return to your unit.”\nThough he hadn’t said so, I got a feeling this was the Sayeret Matkal\nequivalent of a final job interview. When I got back to Beersheva, I dug around\nas discreetly as possible for details about Avraham Arnan. I learned he had\nserved in 1948 in the hills around Jerusalem, so he would have known first-hand\nthe terrain he asked me to describe. That, I guessed, explained the half-smile.\nBut I was entering my last week of tironut. I still had no idea whether I’d be\nspending the next couple of years inside an APC – or in a sayeret whose\nfunction was a mystery, beyond the fact it seemed less interested in whether my\nboots were shined than whether I could pick a lock.\n55\nThe day before the end of basic training, I was told to return to Maka Esser.\nA Jeep was waiting. A soldier was at the wheel. He mumbled hello and drove\nme to a sprawling military base about 15 minutes away, not too far from the\ninternational airport in Lod. It was built by the British in the Second World War\nfor the RAF. After 1948, the main part had been converted into Israel’s officertraining\nschool. But at the far end, set back from a criss-cross of runways, was a\npair of domed concrete shelters which had been used by the British for\nmunitions storage. Five tents. Two field toilets. And a single-story brick\nstructure with a tin roof. It contained offices for Avraham Arnan, a couple of\nother officers and a secretary, a kitchenette and a room for storing weapons.\nThis was the home of Sayeret Matkal, although the first thing I was told was\nthat no one, outside a handful of senior officers in military headquarters, knew\nwe existed.\n* * *\nThe heart and soul of Sayeret Matkal was Avraham Arnan. Even from my\nbrief first encounter with him in his living room in Tzahala, I was struck by his\nphysical presence, with almost movie-star looks and a face made even more\nintriguing by the fact he had different-colored eyes, one brown and one a\npiercing green. But what really set him apart, as I got to know him and come\nunder his spell in the sayeret, was his playful, almost bohemian disregard for the\nnormal strictures and structures, rules and regulations, of the armed forces.\nWhat mattered to him was what actually needed to get done, and how best to\naccomplish it despite all the bureaucratic obstacles, and he made me and his\nother teenage recruits feel we were equal partners with him in getting there.\nYears later, he confided that if his life had not led him into the military, he\nwould have probably chosen something in the arts or culture, maybe directing\nfilms. But he had volunteered for the Haganah at age 17, a year before the 1948\nwar. As the losses mounted in Jerusalem, he found himself in the Palmach’s\ncrack Harel Brigade, under the command of a future Israeli chief-of-staff, Dado\nElazar.\nHis vision for Sayeret Matkal became Israel’s answer to the dangers\nidentified by Rotem. But it had its origins in his experiences in the years after\n1948, when he joined a military intelligence group running a loose network of\nArab agents across Israel’s northern border. They provided occasional bits of\n56\ninformation. But in talking with his wartime friends, he realized this kind of\nlow-level intelligence could never address the real need for Israel: to ensure we\nhad early warning if Syria or Lebanon, Jordan or Egypt, were preparing to go to\nwar against us.\nHe began toying with the idea of training a small force of Israeli soldiers to\ngo on cross-border intelligence missions. The initial response from the kirya –\nmilitary headquarters in Tel Aviv – was so frustrating that anyone else would\nhave given up. None of the generals saw any reason to believe his scheme\nwould work. But the real obstacle was their continuing trauma over what had\nhappened the last time Israeli soldiers crossed the border on an intelligence\nmission. It had happened in 1954, and it ended in a failure even more serious\nthan Rotem. The target was the Golan Heights, inside Syria. The special\ntechnology unit attached to military intelligence had developed a bugging\ndevice designed to be placed on a telephone pole on the Golan. The task of\ninstalling it was given to the most decorated, and respected, commando unit in\nthe army: Company A in Sharon’s paratroop battalion, led by its commander,\nMeir Har-Zion.\nOn a spring night in 1954, Har-Zion led his team onto the Golan. They\nrigged the bugging unit to the telephone pole, buried the bulky transmitter and\nmade their way back. And it worked. Israeli intelligence could listen in to\nmilitary communications on the Heights. The hitch as that the batteries had to\nbe replaced every few weeks. Several more times, Meir and his men sneaked\nback into Syria to keep the bug working. But as commander of Company A,\nMeir was a key part of Israel’s anti-fedayeen operations. The last thing Moshe\nDayan wanted to risk was seeing him captured while trying to replace a few\nbatteries. So he shifted the task to a regular unit from the Golani Brigade.\nIn December 1954, a handover mission was organized. Three men from\nCompany A, including one of Meir’s sergeants, joined three from the Golani\nBrigade. But they didn’t even hold a joint exercise before setting off. There was\nalso a lack of clarity about who was in charge. Though the Golani commander\nwas nominally the senior officer, only the Company A men had any first-hand\nexperience of this kind of mission. A half-mile onto the Heights, they were\nintercepted by a Syrian soldiers. If this had been a Company A operation, the\nresponse would have been automatic. They would have wheeled, opened fire\nand attacked. But when the Syrians ordered the Golanis to drop their weapons,\none of them did, and the Company A men followed suit. They were all taken to\nDamascus, held in solitary confinement, beaten and tortured.\n57\nOne of the captured Golani soldiers was a 19-year-old named Uri Ilan, the\nson of a member of the Israeli Knesset whom Ben-Gurion and the whole of the\ngovernment knew well. The soldiers’ captivity dragged on until they were\nfinally returned to Israel in March 1956. By then, however, Uri Ilan had hanged\nhimself. He managed to hide a note into his uniform. It was found when the\nbody was being prepared for burial. It read: Lo bagadeti. Nekamah. “I did not\nbetray anything. Revenge.”\nEver since the Uri Ilan mission, there had been a de facto ban on crossborder\nintelligence operations by Israeli soldiers. Ben-Gurion and his military\ncommanders knew, of course, the importance of getting early warning of an\nenemy attack. But they decided the price of possible failure was simply too\nhigh.\nSayeret Matkal was born three years later. Avraham was still part of the unit\nrunning low-level agents in Syria and Lebanon, but his commander reluctantly\nagreed to allow him to set up his new intelligence group. His initial\n“headquarters” was a sparsely furnished Tel Aviv apartment. The first people he\nbrought in were veterans of the Palmach’s Arab Platoon, pre-state fighters who\ntrained themselves to pass as Arabs and gather intelligence, or stage raids,\nbehind enemy lines. Next, he invited friends who had served in Unit 101 and\nCompany A. Finally, he enlisted a core of them to help train recruits to his new\nsayeret. He hoped the involvement of these commando veterans would also give\nthe unit credibility inside the kirya. One of them, Micha Kapusta, had been part\nof 101, as had Itzhak Gibli, who had been a teenage Palmachnik in 1948. A\nthird was another Company A officer named Aharon Eshel, known as Errol, in\npart for his undeniably Errol Flynn-like swagger, but also an acronym of his\nHebrew name. But the crowing addition to the group had the distinction of\nhaving led the last successful Israeli bugging mission on the Golan, in addition\nto being the most respected commando in Israel, a man who Dayan would later\ncall the country’s greatest soldier. It was Meir Har-Zion himself.\n* * *\nI was part of the second group of recruits to Sayeret Matkal, in the early\nsummer of 1960. The unit had been given its own base barely a year earlier. Bu\nit had yet to carry out a single mission, and there was no sign of that happening.\nAvraham couldn’t be sure when, or if, the generals in the kirya might give him\n58\nthe go-ahead. Still, he was convinced that if we could demonstrate a toughness,\ncommitment and competence which offered an obvious addition to Israel’s\nintelligence capability, even they would recognize the folly of not using it.\nHe made every one of us feel a part of making this possible. I was one of ten\nnew recruits, bringing the size of the sayeret to twenty. We were almost all\nteenagers. In fact, the oldest of our officers was 21. Most of the men were\nSephardi Jews. For a unit like ours, with the aim of undertaking secret missions\nin Arab countries, Avraham believed that a background in Arabic culture and\nlanguage was an important asset. I was the sayeret’s only lock-picker. But all of\nus had been recruited in the much same way that I was. It was how the top\nPalmach units had been formed, and the way Sharon assembled Unit 101:\nfriends recommending friends, in my case, my old yeled chutz schoolmate from\nthe kibbutz.\nWe trained in the whole range of commando skills. We used not only Uzis,\nbut Soviet-made Kalashnikovs and Gurionov machine guns. We worked with\ndetonators and explosives. We staged raids on Israeli airfields. We conducted\nexercises using rubber dinghies to practice attacking from the sea. But mostly\nwe walked. For hundreds of miles, almost always at night the length and breadth\nof the country. We would study a map of each area, committing every town or\nvillage, hilltop or dry creek bed, to memory before we set off. I can still\nremember what Meir Har-Zion told us: to be truly prepared, you needed to\nspend “an hour for an hour” – an equal time mastering the lay of the land to the\namount you’d need to carry out an operation. It was a gruelling regime –\ndesigned to push us to the very limits of endurance. On one series of exercises,\nwe were limited to a single canteen of water as we trekked deep into the Negev\nDesert. It was gruelling, designed to push us to the very limits of endurance. I\nremember the first time Errol set eyes on me after I joined the unit. He turned to\nAvraham, laughed, and said: “Are we taking high school kids now?” But before\nlong, I was a “high school kid” no longer.\nMeir Har-Zion rarely took a direct part in our exercises. On his final\nCompany A mission, a month before the 1956 war, he had been shot in his\nthroat and arm. A medic saved his life by performing a tracheotomy. But his\nspeech was affected, and he still had almost no use of his right arm. Errol,\nMicha Kapusta and Yitzhak Gibli were more actively involved with us. They\nwere there not only to help train us, but to instill a commando attitude, a spirit\nof confidence bordering on bravado.\n59\nKapusta was our guide on our punishing five-day treks through the Negev.\nThough Avraham would see us off at the start, he stayed back at the base. In a\ncouple of the exercises, we relied on carrier pigeons to keep in touch with the\nbase, until Kapusta began killing them for dinner. Once, on a searingly hot\ndesert afternoon, hours from the nearest hospital, he spotted a poisonous snake.\nHe used pieces of wood to pry its head up from the sand, grabbed its neck and\nstrangled it.\nWe also studied some Arabic, though most of the Sephardi recruits already\nspoke the language. My tutor was a Cairo-born Jew named Amin. In part\nbecause he enjoyed mathematics and played the violin, we hit it off\nimmediately. He was also deaf in one ear. Languages have never been my forte.\nEven in Hebrew, I have a slight lisp. That made mastering Arabic even harder.\nStill, Amin would frequently compliment me on my accent, at which point the\nothers in the class would point out that I was lucky he was hard of hearing.\nA year in, we were given a classroom briefing on what to do if we fell into\nenemy hands. The gist was to tell them only our name, rank and serial number.\nBut we had a special session with Gibli, who told us about what captivity was\nreally like. He had been shot and wounded during a retaliation operation in 1954\nand was captured by the Jordanians. Until his release, he was kept in solitary\nconfinement and tortured. The details of his imprisonment, the beatings and the\ncigarette burns, were lurid. Partly because we were developing a bit of\ncommando self-confidence – but mostly to hide the discomfort of wondering\nhow each of us would react to being in enemy hands – we heckled him over an\naccount that seemed to get more heroic with each retelling. He wisely ignored\nus. He told us that survival would be down not just to physical strength. It\nrequired strength of mind, the kind of subtlety required to give your captors\nsomething to keep them at bay and to establish some form of human bond, to\nbut withhold anything of genuine value.\nA few weeks later, the whole sayeret held a four-day exercise in the Galilee.\nOn the second night, at about four in the morning, we shook off our backpacks\nand settled in for a few hours’ sleep. The first thing I heard was shouting in\nArabic. I saw a guy hovering over me, his face covered. He handcuffed me,\npulled a burlap sack over my head, yanked me to me feet and led me off. We\nwere piled into the back of a truck. From the whispered comments around me, I\nassumed all twenty of us had been taken. We drove for nearly four hours.\nTwice, I got an slap across the face, more painful because of the burlap. I kept\n60\ntelling myself this had to be part of our training. If it was for real, we’d have\nbeen more badly beaten, or killed. Still, I couldn’t be completely sure.\nThe truck lurched to a stop. We were led into a building, down a hallway and\ninto a large room. The walls were bare except for a series of iron rings. Our\ncaptors tore the sacks from our heads for a few moments, and tied our wrists to\nthe manacles. For the first six or seven hours we were kept together, arms\nshackled and raised. Then they took us away one by one. I was the last to be led\nout. I was taken to a room so small there was not even space for a cot. It wasn’t\nuntil the last shaft of light disappeared from the slit-like window near the top of\nwall that the first interrogator showed up. He unlocked the door, entered and\nunfolded a metal chair. He wanted answers: what unit was I from, what did our\nunit do, who were our commanders, what were our orders, and what was our\ndesignated role in the event of war.\nI told him my name, rank and serial number. After each question, I repeated\nthem, or shook my head in silence. “You will answer, sooner or later,” he\nshouted in heavily Arabic-accented Hebrew, hitting me across the face. “All of\nyou will.” For four days and nights, other interrogators shouted out the same\nquestions. I was slapped dozens of times. Punched in the stomach. One of the\ncaptors uncuffed me and bent my arm behind my back, wrenching it upward.\nThough I was determined not to cry out, I grunted in pain. Over and over, I told\nmyself: “This is not for real. They can hurt me. But they have limits. They can\ntwist my arm. They can hurt me. But there’s no way they can break my arm.”\nI was not allowed to sleep. I was never left alone for more than a half-hour.\nIf I was crouching on the stone floor, I would be yanked to my feet and punched\nor slapped. Twice a day, I was taken from my cell to a primitive toilet and given\na minute to relieve myself. There were only two changes to the routine. On a\nfew occasions, five or six of us were brought back into the large room and told\nwe wouldn’t be let go until we had given them more of what they wanted – the\nimplication being that some of us had already talked. And once or twice, the\ninterrogators sent in a good cop. “I can help you,” he told me. “But you have to\ngive me something.”\nBut when it was over, none of us had talked. We didn’t fool ourselves into\nthinking that meant we could hold up in genuine captivity. There, they could\nbreak your arm. They could burn your chest with cigarettes, rip out a fingernail\nor a tooth. They could kill you. The main value had been to give us some sense\nof what we might face. We might still be afraid, but at least it would no longer\nbe fear of the unknown.\n61\nChallenging though our training was, I found every bit of it enthralling and,\nwith each new test passed, somehow empowering and exhilirating. This was all\nthe more remarkable because we had still yet to carry out a single operation. If\nanyone other than Avraham had been in charge, I think the unit might have\nunraveled. The fact that it didn’t was mostly due to of the ethos he created, the\nfeeling that we were a special breed with a critically important common\npurpose, and that sooner or later we would be called on to do special things.\nWhen we were in uniform, it was camouflage dress. When we were on the base,\nwe mostly wore sandals and shorts. We called each other by our first names,\neven the officers.\nIn its first few years, the sayeret sometimes felt less like an army unit than a\ncollege fraternity. Every spring, we organized a feast in a cavernous hangar on\nthe edge of our compound. It was called Chag ha Pri, the Feast of the Fruit. For\ndays ahead of the event, we would mount night raids on kibbutzim, “liberating”\ncrates of every kind of fruit imaginable, and chicken and lamb if we got lucky.\nThe only rule was that none of us would steal from our own kibbutzim. Among\nthe guests at the Feast of the Fruit was an unsuspecting selection of senior\nofficers whom Avraham knew. A few of them got into the spirit, like Dado\nElazar, his Palmach commander from 1948. The Palmach had held similar\nfoodfests, with delicacies grabbed from nearby kibbutzim. Dado was by this\ntime commander of Israel’s armored corps. Since our sayeret was always short\nof gasoline for our exercises, he would divert surplus supplies to us. But other\nguests were less impressed with the pyramids of oranges and avocados and\nmangoes and watermelons. I could almost hear a voice screaming inside them:\nthese are Israeli soldiers. They’re stealing this stuff.\n* * *\nIt was not until the autumn of 1961, nearly eighteen months after I arrived,\nthat it seemed we might actually be given a real mission. This was largely due\nto a change at the top of the military. For much of the 1950s, when Dayan was\nchief-of-staff, his right-hand-man was a Haganah veteran named Meir Amit. In\n1961, the term of Dayan’s successor as chief of staff, Haim Laskov, was coming\nto an end and Amit was in the mix to get the top job. He was already Head of\nOperations. In practical terms, that made him the number-two man in the armed\nforces. But the job went to Tzvi Tzur, Laskov’s deputy. Amit decided to accept\n62\nthe post of Head of Military Intelligence. He knew the importance of\nintelligence, and the potential cost of Israel being taken by surprise in a future\nwar, having been part of the top military leadership during Rotem. He was\nenergetic, bright, and exuded an infectious sense of self-confidence and\nauthority. He also had clout at headquarters. If he decided the time had come to\nrevive cross-border intelligence operations, there was every chance it would\nhappen.\nStill, it was an agonizingly slow process. By the time my period of military\nservice was drawing to an end, it hadn’t happened. I did not seriously think of\nleaving. Though my two years in Sayeret Matkal had been the most physically\ndemanding of my life, they were also the most fulfilling. I did not want to\nforfeit the chance of being part of its finally becoming an operational unit. So I\ncommitted to at least a few more years in the military. I joined my closest friend\namong the recruits, Uri Zakay, for six months in officers’ school as we waited,\nor hoped, for approval to actually use the skills and qualities we had acquired in\nthe sayeret.\nAnd in the summer of 1962, shortly after I returned to the unit from officers’\nschool as a second-lieutenant, the green light finally came.\n63\nChapter Four\nAt first, it was only “approval in principle”. It’s impossible to overstate the\ntrepidation with which Israel’s military brass, and Ben-Gurion himself,\napproached the decision finally to send Sayeret Matkal into action. It was not\njust the fact that we were a unit uttterly untested in the field. The stakes in the\nmission we were contemplating were enormous. For the first time since Uri\nIlan’s deseperate act of suicide in a Damascus jail cell, Israeli soldiers would be\ncrossing into Arab territory on an intelligence mission. Amid continuing\ntensions with the increasingly militant rulers of Egypt and Syria, there seemed\nlittle doubt that at some stage we would again have to fight to defend our\nsecurity, perhaps even our existence as a state. The Rotem debacle had\nhighlighted the danger of a surprise attack, potentially leaving us in a scramble\nto call up reserve units as Syrian or Egyptian tanks advanced on our borders.\nBut the memory of Uri Ilan remained a haunting reminder of the risks of failure.\nMy role, again, came down partly to accident. The man initially chosen to\nlead the operation was someone I’d liked from my first days in the sayeret.\nYa’akov Tal, known as Tubul, was a year older than me. He came from Tiberias\nin the north of Israel. As a teenager, he’d worked for extra pocket money\nalongside shepherds in the hills above the Sea of Galilee, picking up a nearfluent\ncommand of Arabic. He was self-confident without a trace of arrogance,\nwith a natural talent for connecting with his soldiers. In my case, there was a\nfurther bond: a shared fascination with math and sciences.\nBut Tubul had applied to the leading technology institute in Israel, the\nTechnion near Haifa. As he began training his four-man team to cross onto\nSyria’s Golan Heights, he received word that he’d been accepted. The academic\nyear wouldn’t begin until September, and it had been assumed at first that the\noperation would happen before then. But even though Meir Amit was pressing\nthe rest of the military brass for a final go-ahead, it still hadn’t arrived by early\nAugust. Avraham decided he needed a fall-back plan. He called Tubul and me\ninto his office. He said he wanted me to join the team’s training as Tubul’s\ndeputy, and to be ready to step in as commander if that proved necessary. When\nwe next heard from Amit, a week later, it became clear the mission would not\nhappen in time for Tubul to lead it.\nWe would be setting out from the northeast corner of Israel, a patch of\nparkland near a kibbutz called Dan, only a mile or so from where Uri Ilan’s\ngroup had begun its mission. This time, however, the target was more\n64\nambitious. We intended to bug the communications line running east from\nBanias, the Syrians’ base in the north of the Golan, toward Quneitra, their main\nheadquarters. That meant taking a longer route, beginning with a climb onto a\nplateau about 200 feet high and crossing the Banias River toward the Syrian\nbase.\nWe had nearly three weeks for our final preparations. After two years of\nsayeret training, I was confident that, physically, we would be up to the task.\nBut even without the obvious jitters emanating from the kirya, I could not help\nbut be aware of the possibility, and the cost, of failure. Every evening, I would\nstake out time to go through everything that might conceivably go wrong. Years\nlater, when I went to do my graduate studies at Stanford, I was exposed to\nwords of wisdom from a non-kibbutznik – Benjamin Franklin – which probably\nbest summed up what drove my planning for the sayeret’s first operation, and\nthe others that would follow. “Failing to prepare,” he wrote, “is to preparing for\nfailure.”\nRunning into Syrian soldiers was, of course, top of the list of potential\npitfalls. But land mines were also a danger. I got a map of the area from military\nintelligence which, in theory at least, showed the location of mines all along the\nedge of the Golan. But it had been compiled over a period of nearly two decades\non the basis of information from shepherds, smugglers and the occasional Arab\nagent. Whenever they reported seeing the telltale combination of fencing and\nyellow danger triangles, the place was marked. Once it was marked, no one in\nintelligence headquarters dared erase it. The result was that the map now\nshowed an almost unbroken stretch of mines. And within the amount of time\nthat we had to get ready, there was no way of knowing which of the minefields\nwas still there.\nThe timing was chosen by the cycle of the moon. We wanted to cross into\nSyria in as near to total darkness as possible. That meant the final days of\nSeptember. Unlike Tubul, who had been commanding the team from the\nmoment they had joined the sayeret, I’d been working with them for only a\ncouple of months. My deputy for the operation, Avi Telem, was also a\nnewcomer. But he was smart, steady and he had served in the Golani Brigade,\nso he knew the terrain along the border.\nAvraham could not hide his own nervousness as the operation drew nearer.\nA week before we were due to set off, he asked whether we were planning a\nfurther, full-scale exercise. When I said the final run-through was set for the\nfollowing night, in the Negev, he told me he wanted Meir Har-Zion to attend.\n65\nDuring the exercise, Meir said nothing at all. I couldn’t help wondering\nwhether, despite our nearly daily exercises, and my nightly stock-taking, I’d\nsomehow missed an obvious detail in our planning. When we got back to the\nsayeret base, Avraham was waiting for us. “Well?” he asked Meir. “They don’t\nneed me,” he said. “They know what they’re doing.” It was not just a source of\nreassurance for me, but a huge relief for Avraham.\nThe team I’d inherited from Tubul included three gifted soldiers with\ndifferent backgrounds, and different skills. Motti Nagar was born in Cairo. He\nwas short but solidly built, smart, level-headed and almost always smiling. Kuti\nSharabi grew up in a Yemeni family in an impoverished neighborhood in Tel\nAviv. He had a self-deprecating sense of humor, a quick mind and sometimes\neven quicker tongue, but an extraordinary ability to focus on the task at hand.\nThe third member was a kibbutznik. His name was Moshe Elimelech. We called\nhim Moshiko. Utterly self-contained, a man who spoke only when absolutely\nnecessary, he also brought two different qualities to the mission. One was going\nto be indispensable: an almost squirrel-like ability to climb trees. Or telephone\npoles. The other, of which I was a bit more leery, was a total, deeply irrational,\nabsence of fear.\nThough none of us needed a further reminder of the weight being attached to\nour mission, the night before we headed north, Avraham got a call from the\nchief-of- staff’s office. Tzvi Tzur wanted to see me the next morning for a\npersonal briefing. I tried to get Avraham to say no. I pointed out that if we\ndidn’t get going by ten o’clock at the latest, we’d risk throwing everything off\nschedule. But “no” was not an option. After some further back-and-forth, it was\nagreed that I would meet the commander of Israel’s armed forces at nine the\nnext morning at a gas station north of Tel Aviv and join him for the 20-minute\ndrive along the coastal road to a speaking engagement he had in Netanya.\nI saw Avraham again before I set off. “We are beginning an extremely\ncritical 24 hours for our unit, the intelligence corps, in fact for the armed forces\nas a whole,” he told me. “I don’t know what might happen. No one does. Just\nremember two things. First, out there, in the field, you are the ramatkal” – the\nchief of staff. He told me that only I and my team could judge and respond to\nwhat we encountered once the operation started. “And second, this mission has\nto be accomplished.”\nI left see the real ramatkal. Before we began the drive to Netanya, he asked\nme to unfold the map I’d brought with me and talk him through, step by step,\nhow we planned to get onto the Golan, plant the bugging device, and get back\n66\nagain. The more I talked, however, the more I sensed that the details weren’t\nwhat General Tzur really wanted to know. I think what he actually wanted to\ngauge was whether I felt confident. He wanted to reassure himself he wasn’t\ntaking any more than the obvious risks in sending us, in Uri Ilan’s footsteps,\nback into Syria. Fortunately, he didn’t ask whether I was sure we’d succeed. If\nhe had, I would have said, yes, we were prepared. But there was no way we\ncould be certain. Still, he must have got what he wanted. When we reached the\nedge of Netanya, he shook my hand, wished me luck and went on his way.\nThe rest of the team was waiting at the crossroads for me to join them. Two\nteams, in fact: mine, with whom I’d be crossing into Syria in less than 10 hours’\ntime, and our hillutz, or back-up. A hillutz was always a part of sayeret\noperations. The back-up group would stay on the Israeli side of the border. If we\ngot into trouble, they’d come in after us.\nEven after my briefing for the chief of staff, we had one last stop to make on\nthe way north. It was at the headquarters of the army’s northern command. It\nwas in a Tegart fortress, one of dozens built by the British around the country,\nwith watchtowers on each corner of the outer walls. The northern commander\nwas an equally forbidding figure. Avraham Yoffe had served in the British\nartillery in the Second World War and the Golani Brigade in 1948. He used to\njoke with other officers that while they looked like a bunch of kids, he was the\nonly one with the true bearing of a general.\nHe must have been busy when we arrived, because we ended up hanging\naround in the courtyard for nearly 20 minutes. Just as I was beginning to worry\nthat the timetable for what really mattered – our climb up onto the Golan – was\nbeing put at risk, I noticed that off to the side was a beautifully polished jeep. I\nassumed it belonged to General Yoffe, who was known to be an avid hunter and\nwould later become the head of Israel’s National Parks Authority. It had a\npadlocked metal grill on the back which held two jerrycans of gasoline. Yori\nCohen, the commander of the back-up team, and I spotted the fuel containers at\nthe same time. We couldn’t help smiling. Yes, we were about to embark on an\noperation which, assuming we didn’t fail, would finally give Israel real-time\nintelligence from across our border for the first time since the 1950s. But we\nwere still Sayeret Matkal, still chronically short of gasoline for our field\nexercises. And I still hadn’t forgotten how to pick a lock. As Yori stood guard, I\nbroke into the grill and removed the jerrycans, one for each of us, and closed it\nagain. Then, after briefing the general, we headed to our setting-off point. Yoffe\nhimself left to join Avraham Arnan and Meir Amit’s intelligence deputy,\n67\nAhraleh Yariv, in the command post for our mission, atop a hill on the Israeli\nside of the northern border.\nThe sun set at around seven, but we waited for darkness. It was nearly eight\nwhen we set out. Twenty minutes later, we crossed the border. I led the way,\nwith Motti Nagar, Moshiko, Kuti Sharabi and, finally, Avi Telem behind. We\ncarried the bugging equipment and our tools in our backpacks. Avi and I had a\npair of binoculars. Mine were bulkier, but offered a slightly better view in the\ndarkness. Each of us had an Uzi and a pair of grenades. All our planning had\nbeen aimed at getting on to the Golan, installing the bug and getting out again. If\nall went well, no one would even know we’d been there. But we had practiced\nwhat to do if things went wrong. If challenged or ambushed by a Syrian patrol,\nwe would operate by old Company A rules. We would open fire.\nThe climb onto the plateau wasn’t too tough, not nearly as hard as our\nsayeret training treks. When we reached the top, there was no obvious sign of\nany Syrians. Still, we had to move slowly. Even with my binoculars, I could see\nbarely 30 yards into the moonless night, and I had to scan the route ahead, back\nand forth, to make sure there were none of the fences or warning signs to keep\nthe Syrians’ own soldiers, or unsuspecting shepherds, from a minefield. Soon,\nhowever, we found an obviously well-used footpath which I figured was very\nlikely to be safe.\nWhen we had walked a few minutes, we found ourselves going through a\ntangle of bushes and reeds, some of them up to two feet high, still dry and\ncrackly from the summer. Aside from the risk of tripping, I knew the noise we\nwere making might attract attention. I told the rest of the team to hang back 20\nyards behind me. I moved forward to make sure the route was clear before\nsignaling them to follow. I had been slightly nervous on the climb up, not so\nmuch because I expected trouble but because there was no way of knowing\nwhat to expect. Much as I tried to put the concerns of the generals from my\nmind, I also knew that this was no ordinary mission. But almost immediately,\nthe nerves had gone, and I was now focused only on getting us through the next\nminute, the next 20 or 30 yards of the Golan.\nBut as soon as we’d made it across the plateau, we ran into trouble. We\nneeded to cross the Banias River. On our map, I’d picked out what looked to be\na shallow ford. But the water was much higher than we expected. After\nspending 30 minutes scouting the bank for 150 yards in either direction, we\nsettled on what seemed to be the shallowest part. Yet we hadn’t anticipated the\nneed to cross a river in full flow. Worse, we’d never trained to do it. Not had we\n68\nbrought any special equipment. Unless we could figure out a way to cross – and\nquickly – we would be putting the timetable for the whole operation at risk.\nThe only remotely useful tool I could find was two 25-foot lengths of\nparachute wire. We spliced them together. I took the lead end and waded in. I\nsunk up to above my chest, but managed to get across. With Avi Telem on the\nother bank holding his end of the wire, the others used it to help them cross, so\nthey stayed a bit drier. They also kept the intercept equipment dry. Finally, Avi\nfollowed. But both he and I were now soaking wet. We were also behind\nschedule. We had covered less than half of the three-mile route to the telephone\npole. Even if we did manage to install the bugging device, the delay meant we\nmight be spotted on our way back to Israel. We were under strict orders to turn\nback by 1:15 in the morning even if that meant not getting the intercept in place.\nAnd it was already past midnight.\nWe began climbing into the heart of the Heights, planning to go around the\nsouthern edge of the Syrian base at Banias. The vegetation was sparser but we\nstill ran the risk of making noise from the stones and larger shards of rock as we\nweaved our way up. Within 10 minutes, I could see the vague outline of the\narmy camp: several large buildings for several hundred Syrian troops, ringed by\ntrenches with security outposts and a barbed-wire fence on the perimeter.\nFor a half-hour or so, we moved forward in a kind of rubber-band formation.\nI would advance as quietly as I could, listen for signs of Syrian troops, scan the\narea ahead with my binoculars and wave the others to follow. But as I prepared\nto move forward again, I suddenly felt a tug on my shoulder. It was Moshiko,\nand the very fact of his speaking was proof of his alarm. “Ehud,”we’ve got to\ngo faster,” he said. “We won’t get there in time.” I said I understood. But I told\nhim to wait for the others to catch up and stay behind with them as I scouted the\nway ahead. Still, by the time the outer fence of the base came into view, the\nothers had picked up their pace. They were only 15 feet behind me.\nIt was then I heard the sound of movement. I motioned the others down. At\nfirst, I thought it was a wild animal. But then I noticed, 20 feet in front of us and\na bit off to our right on a slight rise, a group of three Syrian soldiers. They were\nlying on rocky scrubland 40 yards outside the fence. One was tossing and\nturning. Another was snoring. I maneuvered my Uzi into firing position just in\ncase. We waited for a minute. Then two. But it seemed clear they really were\nsleeping.\n69\nThen, from directly behind me, came another sound: the hiss of Avi’s bulky\ntwo-way radio. I was worried we’d end up waking the Syrians. But just as I was\nfiguring out how to make sure we got past them before that happened, Avi drew\nup beside me.\n“Ehud,” he whispered. “It’s 1:15. The command post ordered us to turn\nback.”\n“Turn off the radio,” I said, my hand on his elbow, reassuringly I hoped, as I\nled him and the others back a full 100 feet from the Syrians. We took a wider\nroute around the camp. We moved much more quickly on the final mile to the\nroad that led toward Quneitra. We were now well clear of the camp, and I felt it\nwas unlikely we’d run into a patrol. I was also confident we’d have an easier\nreturn trip. I knew what had held us up on the way in: finding a path on the\nplateau clear of mines, figuring out how to cross the river, and the general\nunfamiliarity of the terrain. None of those applied now. I felt we could get the\nbugging job done and still be back before dawn. As we got nearer the road, Avi\nasked me a couple of more times whether he should turn the radio back on.\n“No,” I kept telling him. “It’s OK. I’ll tell you when.”\nIt was about two in the morning when we reached the road. We found a\ntelephone pole set back on the edge of a field. Moshiko hoisted himself onto\nKuti Sharabi’s shoulders, clambered up the pole and installed the bugging\ndevice. The entire operation took him less than 10 minutes. We moved more\nquickly on the way back. By around 3:30, we had crossed the river. “You can\nturn on the radio now,” I told Avi, who was obviously relieved. He handed it to\nme. Using our agreed code words, I reported our location, and added the phrase\nfor “mission accomplished.”\nWhen we began our final descent, it was starting to get light. I assumed we\nwere near enough to the border to make it unlikely we’d be shot at. Still, there\nwas a danger we’d be spotted by a patrol, so I was relieved when we reached the\nmound of boulders, more than ten feet high, that served as a tank barrier outside\nKibbutz Dan. When we stepped behind it, I saw that not only Avraham, but\nMeir Amit as well, were waiting. The Head of Military Intelligence said\nnothing. He didn’t have to. He just shook my hand, beaming. Avraham grabbed\neach of us, one by one, in a bear hug.\nThen, drawing me aside, Avraham said that I had only narrowly missed\nlanding in deep trouble. I assumed my transgression was shutting off the radio\nand disobeying the order to return. That was just part of the problem, however.\n70\nDespite General Yoffe’s angry protests in the command post, Avraham had told\nhim what he’d told me back at the base: that once an operation like this was\nunderway, only the commander on the spot could make life-or-death decisions.\nI was “the ramatkal in the field.” But Yoffe had also discovered that his\njerrycans of gasoline were missing. He insisted that if and when I returned\nsafely from the Golan, I be handed over to the military police.\nI don’t know what I would have told the general if he’d asked me directly\nwhether I broke into his jeep. But in the mix of celebration and relief that the\nSyrian operation had succeeded, I got away with what amounted to a pleabargain.\nI promised both Meir Amit and Avraham – at least one of whom\nbelieved me – that it would not happen again.\n71\nChapter Five\nAlmost no one in Israel knew what we had done. But the next morning, a\npackage arrived at the Sayeret Matkal base from one of the few people who did.\nWe opened it in Avraham’s office. It was a nearly full carton of champagne:\nreal, French champagne, since it would be years before Israel’s embryonic wine\nindustry produced anything similar. Inside was a note from the chief of staff.\n“For the success of the operation,” General Tzur had written. “Minus two\nbottles… to teach Ehud Brog not to shut off his field radio.”\nI assumed that his reprimand was tongue-in-cheek, for the same reason I’d\nescaped being locked up on General Yoffe’s orders as a gasoline thief. Had we\nbeen captured on the Golan, the very future of the sayeret as an operational\nintelligence unit would have been put at risk. Tzur, and Ben-Gurion as well,\nwould have faced a reopening of all the old wounds from the Uri Ilan mission.\nBut not only had we managed to get in and out of Syria in one piece. We had\ntaken at least a first step toward erasing the blind spot in our intelligence\ncapabilities shown up so dramatically by Rotem. A few days later, I received a\nletter from the chief of staff informing me that I was to receive my first tzalash,\nor operational decoration, in recognition of “a mission which contributed to the\nsecurity of the state of Israel.”\nMy own feelings were more mixed. I was proud of what I, and my team, had\naccomplished. On a personal level, too, I felt I’d reached an important landmark\non my unlikely journey from the winter morning when I’d arrived as physically\nfrail, awkward kibbutz teenager at APC boot camp in the Negev; through my\nyears of sayeret training under the strict, sometimes sardonic, but always\nsupportive gaze of Israel’s most storied commandos; to, now, having begun to\nmake a real contribution to Avraham’s vision of a new kind of Israeli military\nunit. But while Avraham, General Tzur and our other military and intelligence\nchiefs celebrated our mission, I felt not so much triumph as relief. I didn’t kid\nmyself: I knew that the operation could just as easily have gone wrong. In fact,\nit very nearly did, through errors or omissions I had made. I made that point, in\ngeneral terms, when we joined Avraham and the rest of the sayeret in a formal\ndebriefing. But that very night, just as I had in the days before we set off, I\nwrote down in detail some of the oversights I knew I’d have to correct if we\nwere to succeed in further missions.\nWhy hadn’t I chosen a route that took us further away from the Syrian base\nat Banias? How had I let us arrive so unprepared, untrained and unequipped for\n72\ncrossing the swollen river? Why hadn’t I taken the time to check the current\nseveral miles downriver inside Israel? And couldn’t we have moved more\nquickly on the way in, even with the delay in crossing the river?\nI was aware of, and grateful for, the confidence Avraham had shown in me.\nHe had taken a chance in choosing me to lead the sayeret’s first, critical\noperation. He must surely have had doubts about whether I could handle the\ntask. Years later, I asked him about it. He told me that he’d been relying on\nintuition. Yes, he realized I’d had no experience of a real cross-border mission.\nBut that was true of everyone else in the unit as well. He was convinced that the\ntools needed for success were self-confidence, attention to detail and an ability to\nthink and act in response to what happened on the ground – all qualities which\nhe was confident that I possessed.\nNow that we had provided Israel access to communications in the north of\nthe Golan, there was a demand for us to do the same in other parts of the\nHeights. I was involved in nearly all of the missions we were asked to undertake\nin the months that followed, either as commander of the main force or the\nhillutz. I was also soon training a new team of recruits for future operations. But\nperhaps the most important sign of Avraham’s confidence was to involve me in\nearly efforts to broaden Sayeret Matkal’s experience and reach beyond pure\nintelligence missions – to create a true special forces unit that could fight as\nwell.\nEarly in 1963, we hosted a visit to the unit by Colonel Albert Merglen, a\nveteran of France’s colonial wars in Indochina and Algeria, and commander of\nthe airborne commando force known as the 11 th Demi-brigade Parchutistes de\nChoc. As the colonel looked on, I led a sayeret team on a live-fire raid in a\ntraining area not far from Lod Airport. We attacked a position protected by\ntrenches and concrete barriers and stormed a two-story building. Eager to\nimpress Mergelen, Avraham even insisted on our wearing French-style berets in\nplace of helmets. I assume it was the attack more than the berets that did the\ntrick. But a couple of months later, Merglen proposed a series of exchanges. The\nfirst would involve an officer from Sayeret Matkal officer spending eight weeks\non a counter-guerrilla commanders’ course in the parachutistes’ training\nheadquarters.\nAvraham picked me to go. The French base was in a 17th-century fortress\nnear Mont Louis, in the Pyrenees along the Spanish border. I’d never been\noutside Israel, at least legally. I had no passport. I didn’t own a suit or a tie. But\nwithin days, I was kitted and fitted. I boarded an El Al flight to Paris and, on a\n73\nstorm-tossed Caravelle, flew to Perpignan in southeastern France. There were\neighteen “shock parachutists” on the course. I had just turned twenty-one. Not\nonly were most of them at least a decade older. They were the epitome of\ntoughness. The guy who taught us how to set booby-traps had parachuted\nbehind German lines in the Second World War. All of the men had fought in\nIndochina and Algeria. One had operated behind Vietminh lines, surviving for a\nyear-and-a-half on nuts, berries, tree bark and snakes. With the benefit of my\nsayeret training, I was at least their equal in fitness. I had also not spent years\nconsuming prodigious amounts of alcohol and smoking Gitanes. But I’d never\nexperienced anything nearly as demanding as some of the training we were put\nthrough.\nWith backpacks crammed with Alpine military gear and lead weights as\nwell, we hiked on to the peaks overlooking the fortress. They were covered with\nsnow and ice from about 6,500 feet upward. We trudged for hours, shifting to\nsnowshoes with cleats for the ice. We were taught how to dig caves in the snow\nand to use ice axes to keep from tumbling down the steeper inclines. We scaled\ncliff faces, without safety cables or nets. Our training inside the fortress always\nincluded a break for lunch. Since the parachutistes de choc were, after all,\nFrench, it was a Paris-restaurant-standard meal with copious quantities of wine.\nI didn’t drink at the time, but could hardly abstain altogether. The first exercise\nafter lunch was pistol marksmanship. The instructors kept well clear when it\nwas my turn.\nYet however impressed, even at times awestruck, I was by the toughness of\nthe French commandos, and the obvious closeness they had built during\ncombat, I began to sense a darker side in them as well. They didn’t talk much.\nEven if they had, my few words of French would not have been much help in\ndeciphering what made them tick. But every few nights, I would accompany\nthem when they walked into the small village down the road for a movie, or a\nfew drinks, and the locals would literally cross the street to avoid us. Later, I\ndiscovered that every one of my French comrades had been involved in the\nOAS, the far-right anti-De Gaulle opposition in the French army in the late\n1950s. In Algeria, they had mounted free-lance attacks on the insurgents, and on\ncivilians as well. Though Algeria had been granted independence the year\nbefore, these men were unreconciled to it. In fact, a few months after my time in\nMont Louis, the Demi-brigade was dismantled, when several of its top officers\nwere found to be involved in an assassination plot against President De Gaulle.\n74\nAfter my return in June 1963, Avraham asked me to share my experiences\nwith the other sayeret officers. I began with the positives. I singled out the sense\nof self-confidence, allied with individual strength and teamwork, that the French\ncommandos had developed from exposure to almost incredible extremes of\ndanger. I believed that their success depended not on eliminating risk. We all\nknew that was impossible. It was about professionalism developed over a period\nof years by men who had served together in the toughest of circumstances. But I\nalso mentioned their darker side, which seemed to me a reminder of the danger\nof the misapplication of the very qualities which made them a formidable\nmilitary force. “The ethos of a unit like theirs, and like ours, is essential to\nmaking us strong,” I said. “But what I saw in France was an entire ecosystem\nthat these guys had created, extremely patriotic in their own minds, reinforced\nby one another. But dangerous for society as a whole.”\n* * *\nIt would be nearly a decade before Sayeret Matkal became not just a military\nintelligence unit, but a fighting force, and I would turn out to have a central role\nin making that happen. But there was an almost equally daunting challenge we\nwere called on to tackle first – a critical one, if Israel was going to be truly\nprepared in the case of a further war. For while our bugging missions on the\nGolan had reduced our vulnerability to a surprise attack in the north, the real\nchallenge of Rotem had yet to be addressed. It was Egypt – with its hundreds of\nbattle tanks, and hundreds of thousands of men under arms – that was by far our\nmost powerful Arab enemy. President Nasser wasted no opportunity to flaunt\nhis determination to fight, defeat and ultimately erase the state of Israel. But we\nstill had no reliable, real-time intelligence on his forces.\nFixing that, if such an operation was even possible, would make our bugging\noperations on the Golan look like mere boy-scout missions. We could not\nsimply walk into Egypt with our backpacks, find a telephone pole on one of the\nfew roads crossing the vast expanse of desert, and attach a bugging device. The\nidea was to tap into the main military communications cable in the Sinai. That\nmeant using a vastly more powerful, and far bulkier, intercept apparatus,\nweighing more than half a ton. Even getting it into Egypt would be a problem.\nWe certainly couldn’t carry it our backpacks, or tow it across the sand. Even if\nwe figured a way to get it there, we would still have to dig up the Egyptian\n75\ncable, install the machinery, cover our tracks and get back into Israel again\nundetected. Even if we managed to avoid getting captured, without completely\ncamouflaging what we’d done, the Egyptians would discover what we had\ndone, almost certainly tipping off Syria as well to our bugging operations on the\nGolan Heights.\nThe difficulties with a Sinai operation weren’t just theoretical. Almost a year\nbefore leading the first mission on the Golan, I’d actually been involved in\npreliminary planning, and fairly detailed training, for such a mission in the\nSinai. We’d ended up abandoning the idea as obviously unworkable.\nBut Meir Amit, not just our unit’s overall commander in the kirya but Chief\nof Operations during Rotem, recognized that getting intelligence access to\nEgypt was central to Israeli security. He was intent on reviving the plan to tap\ninto Nasser’s communications in the Sinai. So was Avraham Arnan. He enlisted\nthe backing of an old friend, Uri Yarom, who was now commander of the Israeli\nAir Force and was eager to put our fleet of recently acquired Sikorsky S-58\nhelicopters to operational use. When Avraham called me in to tell me what he\nhad in mind, he began by saying it would be “by far the greatest challenge\nwe’ve contemplated” – typically disarming candor, but also a challenge which\nI’m pretty sure he knew would only increase my determination to at least try.\nThe flight in would be difficult enough. Israel had never before tried such a\nheliborne mission. But he told me that wasn’t my problem. “That will be Uri’s\njob.” The really testing part would be to carry out an mission, at night, deep\ninside Egypt, cover our tracks and get out again in one piece. “Still, I’m sure\nthat we can succeed,” he said. “And I want you and your team to do it.”\nEven now, more than half-a-century later, some of the details of how we\nplanned to tap into the Egyptians’ communications remain classified. But once\nI’d chosen my team of sayeret soldiers for the mission, we trained for nearly\nnine months. We drafted in geologists to identify areas of the Negev similar to\nthe terrain we’d find in the Sinai. We developed a series of methods to prevent\nEgyptian soldiers or scouts from discovering that we’d been there – assuming,\nof course, we managed to get in, attach the intercept, and return safely. It was a\nrelentless process of trial… and error.\nOne of the many reasons we’d abandoned the plan a couple of years earlier\nwas that, in a nighttime exercise to see whether we could avoid detection by\nIsrael’s own crack desert scouts, we’d failed utterly. Now, after many weeks of\ntraining in the Negev, we did, finally, succeed – in a test running for four\n76\nstraight nights which replicated, as nearly as we could, what we intended to do\nacross the border in the Sinai. It was as if we’d never been there at all.\nYet there were the errors, setbacks and frustrations as well. Many months\ninto our planning, we conducted a series of run-throughs in which we simulated\nattaching the intercept to Israel’s telephone network in the south, not far from\nthe camp where I’d done my tironut. Though it all seemed to go as planned, the\nnext morning in rained heavily. Within hours, the phone company was getting\nreports from all around southern Israel of phones malfunctioning. Even\nallowing for the fact it rained less in the Sinai, we had to address the risk. I went\nto see the people in Meir Amit’s technology unit, and they began developing a\nwaterproofing system for the equipment.\nThe main problem with the equipment, however, was its sheer weight. The\nhelicopter could get us, and it, into Egypt. But we couldn’t fly directly to the\ncable site in the Sinai. We might just as well tell the Egyptians we were on our\nway. At around 1,100 pounds, it was much too heavy for us to carry. And if we\nwere going to go ahead with the mission, time was running short. A date for the\noperation had been set by the kirya: February 1964. I was not alone in believing\nthat, unless we cracked the problem of getting the equipment to the cable site,\nthe operation was impossible.\nThe solution came from a staff officer in military intelligence. Meir Amit\nvisited our base once a month to hear how the preparations were going. With the\ndate getting closer, he brought along his entire staff. When I raised my concern\nabout the weight problem, a colonel from his personnel section said: “Why not\nbuild a lightweight rickshaw, small enough to get in the door of the helicopter,\nbut which can carry all or most of the equipment once you’re on the ground?”\nWithin days, they had a prototype, made of airline-standard tubing and designed\nto be pulled by two men. We held an exercise in the Negev. But it was almost\nimpossible for two men to pull through the sand. It also left deep zig-zag\nimprints in the sand, which would surely raise the suspicions of the Egyptians.\nBut prototype number-two was a four-wheel, chrome alloy cart. The\ntechnology experts had made the axles telescopic, so the vehicle would get\nthrough the door of the chopper but could be expanded to the width of an\nEgyptian army Jeep. They had borrowed nose wheels from a training jet. To\ncomplete their oeuvre, they glued on real tire tread from one of the Egyptian\nJeeps we had captured in the 1956 war.\n77\nWe were as ready as we were ever going to be. We got the final go-ahead\nfrom in mid-February. Our backpacks were crammed full with the whole array\nof equipment we’d designed, commandeered or purchased for the mission –\nincluding a metal detector we got from a hobby shop in Pennsylvania. All the\ncargo except our personal gear, our weapons and our communications\nequipment was loaded onto the cart. A command post was set up in a few\nwooden huts on Mount Keren in the Negev, complete with special antennas to\nreceive the intercept transmissions if we succeeded. Not since the first Golan\noperation had the attention of the kirya been so keen, or the stakes so high. In\naddition to Meir Amit, and of course Avraham, also flying down to Mount\nKeren would be General Tzur’s successor as armed forces chief of staff – a\ngruff Palmach veteran whom I’d met very briefly at the end of my officer’s\ncourse but who I would come to know well, and work closely with, in the years\nahead: Yitzhak Rabin.\n* * *\nThe helicopter lifted off at about six-thirty at night. Compared to special\noperations nowadays, the mission still had a somewhat improvised feel about it.\nCertainly, that was true of the equipment we were ferrying in, and the tools\nwe’d devised to make sure we could get it installed and working. But the men in\nmy team were soldiers I’d trained from the day they arrived in the sayeret.\nAchihud Madar was unfailingly surefooted, whether finding his way alone at\nnight on unfamiliar ground or in a firefight inside a building. He also had\nnatural dexterity. He and another of the soldiers who was also gifted with his\nhands, Nissim Jou’ari, would be performing the most technically delicate part of\nthe operation on the cable. The third member was Oded Rabinovitch. Tall, thin\nand quiet, he was absolutely reliable in whatever part of an operation he was\ngiven to execute. And as my deputy commander, I’d chosen a sayeret officer\nnamed Kobi Meron, who’d been with me on a number of Golan missions. Over\nsix feet tall, he was probably the strongest man in the unit, quick-thinking and\nutterly unflappable.\nWhen we landed, we telescoped out the axles on the cart. The roar of the\ndeparting chopper was replaced by silence. Under the soft light of hundreds of\nstars, I led the way deeper into the desert. It took nearly an hour to reach the\nroad leading to the cable site. Though traffic was light, I posted Oded and\n78\nNissim as lookouts. Kobi and I began digging a trench. The top layer of sand\nwas easy to remove. But then, just a few inches down, our shovels struck\nsomething hard. Maybe it was a sheet of rock. Maybe sand packed tight over the\nmillennia. But it resisted all our attempts to break through.\nWe had to find a way to get far enough beneath the surface to install the\nequipment. I called back Oded and Nissim from lookout duty. All four of us\nattacked the subsoil with every tool in our backpacks that could conceivably\nhelp. It took nearly three hours in all. But we finally managed to carve out a\ntrench that seemed as if it might just do the job. It wasn’t as deep or as wide as\nwe’d planned. But we were approaching a point where we would have to give\nup. We couldn’t risk any more time digging, and still leave time to attach the\nintercept unit, cover our tracks and make the rendezvous with the helicopter to\ntake us back into Israel.\nAchihud and Nissim cramped themselves into the hole and got to work, like\nsurgeons in an operating theater, silent except for the faint hum of the intercept\nequipment. Within a little less than an hour, they’d finished the main part of the\nwork. During our training exercises, we’d factored in a fall-back plan, a way of\nensuring we got the unit installed but without additional equipment to extend its\nbattery life. Since we were still behind schedule, I was tempted to stop while we\nwere ahead. But having come this far, and knowing the potential risks of a\nfurther mission to refresh the power unit and replace the batteries, I told them to\nkeep going, and also to take the extra few minutes needed to make sure the\nequipment was functioning.\nWe had to be out of Egypt by first light, and we were now left with more\nthan an hour’s less time than we had reckoned on to make it back to the\nrendezvous point. There was another problem, too, which I at first sensed more\nthan saw. A bank of fog was closing in. It had come in patches at first, but was\ngetting denser. We had the same radio we had taken on to the Golan. We’d\nworked out codewords for each part of the operation but otherwise agreed to\nbreak silence only if absolutely necessary. Now, I had no choice. If the fog\ncontinued to thicken, it would block any chance of the helicopter getting in. I\nradioed the command post and said as calmly as I could: “The milk is coming.”\nIt wasn’t elegant. But “milk” was our codeword for fog. The chopper would\nnow try to bring us out within 30 minutes.\nMoving more quickly now that the cart was nearly empty, we made our way\neastward. As conditions worsened, I radioed again with a short series of\nnumbers: directions for a new pickup point. Even that seemed like it might not\n79\nwork. The fog now enveloped us completely. I brought the team to a stop. I\nstayed with the cart while the other four outlined a landing area with kerosene\nflares in the hope that the pilot would see us. It was another five minutes when\nwe heard the thump of chopper blades. Though we couldn’t see more than a few\nfeet, I suddenly saw the outline of the landing gear and then the underbelly. But\nthe helicopter did not seem in control. It was drifting towards where I was\nstanding with the cart. It was just seconds away from hitting me when its nose\nwrenched upward. It landed with a judder a dozen yards away. Later, I learned\nthe navigator had realized the craft was drifting and, just before impact, shouted\na warning to the pilot.\nWe piled in, secured the cart and took off. Within a minute, the murky\nblanket of fog was below us. As we swooped back into Israel, I could see the\nfirst pink of sunrise. By the time we touched down at Tel Nof air force base,\nsoutheast of Tel Aviv, the command post in the Negev was receiving the first\nintercepts.\nA few days later, one of the sayeret soldiers gave me a first-hand insight into\nthe mood in the command post in the final stages of the operation. Avsha\nHoran’s role had been to act as security guard for the top brass in Mount Keren.\nHe occasionally took a peek inside. He described to me the atmosphere when I\nradioed my “milk is coming” message: solemn faces, hushed conversations\nbetween Avraham and Meir Amit. And off to the side, the recently elevated\nchief-of-staff, Rabin, chain-smoking and biting his nails. Finally, the audible\nsighs of relief when the pilot radioed in with his final message from the\nchopper: “Out of the fog. Heading home.”\n* * *\nWith the rest of the team, I was invited to see Yitzhak Rabin ten days later.\nWe were being given a further tzalash. This was the first time I’d met him since\nleaving officers’ school two years earlier, when, with a few terse words, the\nthen-deputy chief of staff congratulated me and several other cadets who\ngraduated with top honors. I had felt a bit overwhelmed in his presence. Now, I\nwas struck by how shy he seemed. He greeted each of us with a tentative\nhandshake, and seemed uncomfortable in making eye contact. Yet once he\nbegan asking me about the Sinai operation itself, it was as if he was\ntransformed. He was hungry for every detail, anxious to know the way we’d had\n80\nto adapt on the ground. And obviously pleased that we’d found a way to make\nthe operation work.\nThe Sinai mission marked a transition not just for me, but for others in\nSayeret Matkal as well. Avraham Aranan finally left the unit he’d imagined,\ncreated and built. He became the head of the technology unit in military\nintelligence. His deputy, Dovik Tamari, succeeded him, serving the first in what\nwould become two-year stints for each of his successors as the sayeret’s\ncommander. I, too, was given a wider role. Though I was still just a young\nlieutenant, and too junior for the job, Dovik made me his de facto deputy, with\nresponsibility for operational oversight of our missions. I returned to the Sinai a\nyear later, not in that capacity but because of my on-the-ground experience, to\naccompany a sayeret team which installed an intercept on a second Egyptian\ncommunications cable.\nThough the tzalash was gratifying, what gave me more satisfaction, and\npride, was the importance of the Sinai operations themselves. I was confident\nthat if we did have to go to war again, the equipment we installed, along with\nthe bugs on the Golan, would give us an essential edge. But in truth, I didn’t\nactually believe there would be another war. Sure, the threat was still there.\nEgypt, in particular, still seemed determined to find a way to hobble, and if\npossible eliminate, Israel. But especially since the 1956 war, the fedayeen\nattacks, and cross-border skirmishes, had been subsiding. Not long after the\nsecond Sinai intercept mission, I was chatting with other officers on the sayeret\nbase and remember turning to one of them and saying I was sure that by the\ntime I was married and had a teenage child, we’d be able to take a skiing\nholiday in Lebanon. We didn’t have peace yet. That might take time. But I felt\nthat things were getting more normal.\nI began thinking what that would mean not just for Sayeret Matkal or Israel,\nbut for my own future. By the autumn of 1964, I’d reached a decision: to end\nmy active service in the unit that had been central to my life since leaving the\nkibbutz. Dovik did persuade me to delay, for nearly a year. But at the end of the\nsummer of 1965, I left Sayeret Matkal. In fact, I left the army altogether. I went\nto study mathematics and physics at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. I would\nremain involved in the sayeret as a reservist. But I couldn’t see devoting my\nadult life to military service in a country which, fortunately, seemed on a\ntrajectory toward peace. I had spent five years in an extraordinary unit. It had\nbeen more fascinating and fulfilling than I could have dreamed of when I’d\n81\nfinished my tironut. Now I looked forward to pursuing a different path with\nequal eagerness and energy.\nThere was also something else which colored my thinking. For the first time\nin my life, I had fallen in love.\n82\nChapter Six\nThe French have an expression for love at first sight: coup de foudre. A\nthunderbolt. That was how it felt when I’d set eyes on nineteen-year-old Nili\nSonkin in mid-February 1963.\nIt was my first visit to the kirya in Tel Aviv. I’d been told to report to the\nadministrative section, to register my formal change of status from a mere\ndraftee to a staff officer, something I’d managed to overlook amid the demands\nof our first sayeret operations on the Golan. Since I didn’t know which office to\ngo to, I asked a girl sitting at a desk near the entrance. She looked up with a\nwide smile. When she directed me to the second floor, it wasn’t just her voice\nthat struck me: multi-timbered, almost like a musical composition. It was her\neyes. Bright, radiant, green. Full of playful, unapologetic self-confidence.\nIn the weeks that followed, I invented a series of excuses to return to the\nkirya. I introduced myself to her, with as much composure as I could muster,\nand on each further visit chatted to her a bit more. I told her about growing up in\nMishmar Hasharon, about math and music, about Israel, and how, as a soldier in\nthe past few years, I’d walked almost every inch of the land – in short, about\neverything except our still-secret sayeret and our nighttime forays across the\nborder. She, too, opened up about her home and her family and her friends.\nThough there was another girl I’d been going out with – the younger sister of\nmy old kibbutz co-conspirator, Moshe – she was more a friend than a girlfriend.\nI’d never before felt anything like the connection I sensed with Nili, nor\nanything like the race in my heartbeat as I set out to see her.\nI also found myself gripped by an unexpected, and unfamiliar, lack of selfassurance.\nI was now 22, three years older than Nili. I had the inbred confidence\nof a kibbutznik, the quiet sense of specialness which, at least for another decade\nor so, would give the children of the kibbutzim a disproportionate place in\nIsrael’s government and army, media and the arts. The same confidence which\nhad convinced me as a raw recruit back in boot camp that I could lead a supply\nconvoy to the edge of the Sinai. Since then, I’d begun to make a mark in Sayeret\nMatkal as well, leading its first clandestine operation and receiving a citation\nfrom the chief-of-staff. Yet with Nili, I couldn’t help feeling unmoored, totally\nout of my depth. She was part of a different Israel. She was a Tel Avivit, born\nand raised in the largest and brashest city in our young state, a place which was\neverything the kibbutz was not. She had graduated from Alliance, a high school\n83\nin north Tel Aviv set up with French backing and an accent on French language\nand culture. Unlike the girls on the kibbutz – proud of their plain, utilitarian\nclothes and sensible shoes – she wore make-up and perfume and, when she was\nout of uniform, bright print dresses. She never tried to make me feel out of place. Still,\nit was sometimes hard not to wonder whether she saw me as a country bumpkin – a\nnice, interesting, bright county bumpkin, perhaps, but still an interloper or a curiosity in\nher world.\nIt wasn’t until April, the day before I was due to leave for the French commando\nfortress in Mont Louis, that I plucked up the courage to ask her out. I needn’t have\nworried. She smiled. In fact, she proposed that since I was about to leave the country,\nshe should be the one doing the asking. She invited me to dinner that evening at\nthe apartment she shared with her parents and younger sister, about a half-mile\nfrom the kirya, a few blocks back from the Mediterranean. Dinner was less\nawkward than I feared, but I still felt nervous, until the dishes were cleared and\nNili and I went out to chat on the apartment balcony and, just before I left, to\nshare a first kiss.\nWe wrote each other almost every day while I was away in France. Once I\ngot back, we met whenever I wasn’t preparing for a sayeret operation. This was\nthe first girl I’d known whom I could talk to, and listen to, on almost any\nsubject with a feeling that it was natural and somehow meant to be. But in the\nsecond half of 1963, I was working almost non-stop on preparing for a sayeret\noperation. I still saw Nili when I could, sometimes at her apartment, but also\noccasionally going out to a movie, a meal or a concert in Tel Aviv. Yet what I\nmost wanted was an acknowledgment that we were not just dating: a\ncommitment that we intended the relationship to last. I didn’t say this to Nili.\nYears later, she would say this was down to pride. In fact, I was afraid she\nwould say no. And in the periods when we were apart, I couldn’t help asking\nmyself why she hadn’t raised the question of a deeper commitment.\nEven more frustrating, by the time I entered Hebrew University in\nSeptember 1965, our relationship was again being conducted by mail. After her\nmilitary service, she took a two-year posting at our embassy in Paris. I could\nunderstand the attraction, not just because of her taste for all things French. She\nwas working with the Mossad to help Moroccan Jews skirt an official\nemigration ban and get to Israel. Still, it meant that charting our future together,\nif we had one, was going to have to wait.\n84\n* * *\nThe intellectual experience at university everything I hoped. The challenge\nwas finding a way to juggle my studies with my military reserve duty. In other\nunits, most reservists could schedule their one month per year when classes\nweren’t in session. To be of use to Sayeret Matkal, I’d have to report when I\nwas most needed, and four weeks was unlikely to be enough. Near the end of\nmy first term, from late 1965 into the new year, I was called to participate in our\nlatest mission into the Sinai. The next winter, and through early 1967, I was\ncalled up for another mission and was away for nearly two months.\nThat operation was prompted by the fact the Egyptians had begun laying a\nnew communications cable, parallel to the one where we’d put our intercepts.\nWith the diggers getting closer to where I’d led the first Sinai mission, the\nkirya was worried that they might unearth the apparatus we’d installed. In\ntheory, at least, we’d planned for that. The bugging unit which we buried\nincluded a booby-trap explosive device. Still, nearly four years on, we couldn’t\nbe absolutely sure it would work. So the decision was taken to send the sayeret\nback on a further night crossing into the Sinai, defuse the explosives, and bring\nthe whole thing back to Israel. Since I was the one who’d installed it, I was\ngiven the job of removing it.\nThe officer in overall command of the mission was Nechemia Cohen. He\nwas a good friend, and one of the finest officers in the unit. Before I left for\nuniversity, I’d mentored him so that he could take over my role as the effective\nnumber-two officer in the sayeret, in charge of all our core operational\nactivities. He, too, was now about to leave, though not to for university. He was\nbecoming deputy commander of a paratroop company, under another former\nSayeret Matkal, named Yechiel Amsalem.\nI was meant to defuse the booby-trap remotely: with a 12-foot-long metal\ntool designed by the technology unit. I was fairly confident I’d manage. But\nwhen Chief-of-Staff Rabin heard about the operation, he summoned me, along\nwith Eliezer Gonn, the scientist working with us on the plan to defuse the\nbooby-trap. Rabin was with a half-dozen other officers when we arrived. Gonn\nhad brought along a mock-up of the explosive device, which he proceeded to\nplace on Rabin’s office table. But as I took out the extension tool and started to\nexplain how I was going to defuse the device, Rabin turned to Gonn and asked:\n“Could it blow up spontaneously?”\n85\n“Yes, it could,” he said.\n“What?” Rabin barked.\nGonn replied matter-of-factly: “It is a physical device. It obeys the laws of\nphysics. When, for instance, there’s a thunderstorm in Turkey, a flash of\nlightning could discharge at precisely the frequency needed, or one of its lower\nharmonies, with enough energy to activate the fuse in the detonator.”\nI was far junior to everyone else in the room. But as a physics student, I was\nprobably the only one who could fully follow the argument he was making.\nLooking at Rabin’s expression, it was clear that he was about to cancel the\noperation on the spot. “Excuse me, sir,” I said. “Could I ask Doctor Gonn\nanother question?”\nI pointed at an unopened bottle of orange soda on Rabin’s desk. “Tell me,” I\nasked the physicist, “is it possible that the fluid in that bottle is spontaneously\nleaking through the glass even as I’m speaking?”\n“Sure,” Gonn said. “It might take years before even a fraction of a centimeter\nof the soda goes missing. But glass is like a ‘frozen’ liquid, and liquid water, or\nthe molecules, are seeping into, and through, the more viscous ‘liquid’ of the\nglass. It’s just physics.”\nRabin looked at me, then at Gonn. But he had clearly got the message. “The\noperation is confirmed,” he said, in the deep, gravelly voice I would become\nmuch more familiar with in the years ahead. “Good luck.”\nThe device didn’t explode, but I couldn’t defuse it either. I did manage to get\nthe remote metal tool locked on the bolt on the booby trap. But it wouldn’t\nbudge – even when I waved back Nechamia and the others and took out an\nordinary wrench. Though this was the first of my sayeret missions that ended in\nfailure, that wasn’t what worried me as we boarded our helicopter back into\nIsrael a couple of hours before dawn. It was the real possibility that the\nEgyptians would inadvertently discover that we’d been intercepting their\ncommunications. Dovik Tamari, as sayeret commander, was especially upset.\nThis was one of the last operations during his period in command of the unit. He\nwas about to hand over to a veteran paratroop officer, Uzi Yairi.\nYet our aborted Sinai mission turned out not to matter. What saved our\neavesdropping network was the very thing which I was confident would not\nhappen when I left for university: another Arab-Israeli war.\n86\n* * *\nTension began building in the north in the spring of 1967, initially set off by\nSyrian efforts to divert water from the upper reaches of the Jordan River, an\nimportant water source for Israel was well. In a series of exchanges, Syrian\ntroops on the Golan fired on Israeli tractors in the demilitarized zone below, and\nbegan shelling our argicultural settlements in the Galilee, while we responded\nwith tank fire and then air power, scrambling our jets and shooting down six\nSyrian MiG-21s.\nThe first indication that we might be headed toward war came as I returned\nto university for the spring term, and trouble began brewing in the south. Ben-\nGurion had by now retired as prime minister. His successor was the undeniably\nthoughtful, if far less charismatic, Levi Eshkol. During Israel’s Independence\nDay parade on May 15, he received word that Egypt had moved thousands of\ntroops into the Sinai, nearer to the border with Israel. Then, with the Soviets\nwarned Nasser of what they said were Israeli plans for a preemptive strike\nagainst Syria, he went further expelling the United Nations force put in place\nafter the 1956 war. On May 23, he closed the Straits of Tiran, Israel’s trading\ngateway to the Red Sea and the source of virtually all our oil imports.\nI was told to report to Sayeret Matkal the following day, as part of the first\ngroup of reservists called up. When I reached the base, Uzi Yairi, who was now\nin charge of the unit, organized us into four teams. He put me in command of\none of them. We were told to prepare ourselves to helicopter into the Sinai,\nattack a series of Egyptian air bases and put the runways out of commission. My\nteam’s target was the base at Gebel Libni, not far from where I’d placed, and\nrecently failed to defuse, our first intelligence intercept.\nWith each passing day, war looked more likely, and there was no confidence\nwe would win without a costly struggle. In 1948, Arab attacks had killed about\n170 people in Tel Aviv. Now, word got out that a park in the center of the city\nhad been set aside to allow for the burial of as many as 5,000. With Israel’s\nmilitary commanders pressing Eshkol to take the initiative and launch a\npreemptive strike, he delivered a radio address at the end of May, intended to\nreassure the country the situation was under control. But due to last-minute,\nhandwritten changes to his typescript, he faltered while reading it. He sounded\n87\nanything but under control. Within days, he bowed to political pressure and\nbrought back Moshe Dayan, now a member of the Knesset, as Defense Minister.\nI still vividly remember a visitor to the sayeret the day after Eshkol’s\naddress. Colonel Eli Zeira was head of the “collection department” of the\nintelligence corps, the rough equivalent of America’s National Security Agency.\nFormally, Sayeret Matkal was part of his department. He called together all the\nofficers. He said that there had so far been three periods in the Zionist project.\nThe first was from the early settlements in Palestine at the end of the 19th\ncentury until the establishment of Israel in 1948. The second, from 1948 until\nthe 1956 War. The third from 1956 until now. Then he said: “There will soon be\na war. Three Arab countries will take part. Within a week, we will defeat all of\nthem. And a new chapter in the history of Zionism will begin.”\nThe Six-Day War began on June 5, 1967. As Eli Zeira so confidently\npredicted, not just Egypt and Syria, but Jordan, too, joined forces against us.\nAnd it was indeed all over within a week. The final outcome – Israel’s victory –\nwas sealed by noon on the first day, with wave after wave of pre-emptive\nbombing sorties destroying the entire air force of all three Arab countries. But\nthe fighting which followed was brutal in places: especially around Jerusalem,\nbut also in the south at the outset of the war, and later on the Golan Heights.\nThe first effect back in Israel of our air force attacks was to make our sayeret\nhelicopter missions into the Sinai suddenly superfluous. In fact, it left the entire\nunit at loose ends – especially veterans or reservists like me who had been part\nof our nearly decade-long development into Israel’s sole, dedicated cross-border\ninfiltration force. At this point, we were still just an intelligence unit, not an\nelite commando force like Britain’s SAS, Avraham Aranan’s ultimate vision for\nthe sayeret. The aim of our bugging missions into Syria and Egypt was not to\nfight. It was to get in and get out, unseen and undetected. But we were not only\nequipped to fight if necessary. From the unit’s earliest days under the sway of\nMeir Har-Zion, Kapusta and Gibli and Errol and the other grizzled vets from\nUnit 101 and Company A, we had been steeped in the spirit of commandos. Our\ntraining was the most rigorous in the Israeli armed forces, involving not just a\npunishing endurance régime but learning to assemble and disassemble, fire and\ndetonate, everything from handguns to machine guns, makeshift explosives to\ngrenades and landmines.\nThe frustration we felt on the first morning of the war was not because we\nwere itching to fight, for the hell of it. One hallmark of the sayeret’s ethos,\nespecially once the unit did start to evolve into a full-fledged commando unit,\n88\nwas always the principle of targeted force, the idea that we would take out\ntargets, or defeat enemies, out of military necessity. But even on the first day of\nthe war, it was clear that it would be by far the most consequential conflict in\nour country’s history. There was no mission for Sayeret Matkal, nor, it seemed,\nany prospect of our playing any significant part.\nThe fact that my own role was slightly less peripheral was due to Avraham\nArnan. He phoned me almost as soon as we’d got news of the Israeli air victory,\nand told me he had been told to take a few men from the sayeret across the\nsouthern border. Our assignment was to complete our failed attempt to defuse\nthe booby-trap on the intercept in the Sinai. I quickly drafted in two others from\nthe unit. One was Danny Michaelson, a friend from Hebrew University, where\nwe had been lab partners. The other was Rafi Friedman, our paramedic, who\nhad been with me on several of our missions on the Golan.\nAvraham arrived at the base around noon. I got a Jeep and we set off. We\ncrossed into Egypt around four o’clock in the afternoon and headed for the field\nheadquarters of Israel Tal. Known as Talik, he was the commander of Israel’s\narmored corps, and Avraham knew him well. His wartime division consisted of\nthe country’s premier tank unit, the Seventh Armored Brigade, and a reserve\nbrigade. We accompanied them the next day to an abandoned Egyptian camp\nnot far from El Arish, in the northern Sinai. At least, we’d assumed it was\nabandoned. As Talik and Avraham were talking in his command post, we heard a\nsudden burst of gunfire, which seemed to come from just a few dozen yards\noutside. As everyone inside the command post looked around, Avraham turned\nto me and said: “Ehud, don’t you think we ought to deal with it?” Then, to\nTalik: “Make sure none of your guys shoots him.”\nI got Danny and Rafi. We made our way toward an underground bunker,\nwhich seemed the most likely source of the gunfire. Hugging the wall as I led\nthe way down a series of concrete steps, I clicked off the safety on my Uzi just\nin case. But with the main Egyptian forces in obvious retreat, I figured that\nwhoever was doing the shooting would have to be shellshocked, or insanely\nbrave, to put up a fight. There were eight men crouched inside, soldiers and\nseveral staff officers cradling Kalashnikovs, and an Egyptian army general. In\nwhat was obviously at least serviceable Arabic, I told them all to raise their\nhands. I made a brief attempt to interrogate the general, but quickly reached the\nlimits of my linguistic proficiency. So we marched them away and handed them\nover to Talik’s intelligence officers.\n89\nThis interlude instantly conferred on us the desert equivalent of street cred.\nThe next morning, Talik agreed we could accompany the Seventh Brigade as it\nmoved deeper into the Sinai, and peel off when we got closer to Gebel Libni to\ncomplete our “sayeret mission.” Given the early course of the fighting, and our\nforces’ rapid advances in the Sinai, I couldn’t help wondering whether there\nwas any real need to defuse, much less remove, the bugging machinery. But the\nvery fact that the kirya, in the early hours of the war, had still wanted us to try\nwas a reflection of the deep sense of apprehension in Israel in the weeks before\nthe war. Even now, it appeared, there was a concern that the Egyptians might\nreclaim the parts of the Sinai which we had captured.\nWhen the armored column got close to Gebel Libni, I pulled our Jeep aside\nand headed for the stretch of communications cable where we’d planted the\nintercept. For several hours, I tried to accomplish in broad daylight what I’d\nfailed to do in the desert darkness four months earlier. But it was no use. I\nfinally told Avraham we’d be better off just blowing it up. I attached an\nexplosive charge and set a two-minute delay. We watched from a couple of\nhundred yards away as the whole assembly disintegrated. Then we rejoined the\nSeventh Brigade.\nBefore sunset on the third day of the war, we reached the Egyptian air base\nat Bir Gafgafa in the heart of the Sinai. Even had the war ended then, we would\nhave been in control of a large chunk of the desert buffer zone which Ben-\nGurion had hoped to retain after the 1956 war. But now, more quickly than even\nthe most optimistic planners in the kirya could have anticipated, Talik was\npoised to move on – toward the Suez Canal, and the main towns and cities of\nEgypt. As the Seventh Brigade billeted down in Bir Gafgafa, Talik sent his\nreserve brigade westward, in the direction of the canal.\nWe went with them. The battalion was more mobile than a pure tank force,\nbut also more vulnerable: lightly armored French AMX-13s and a collection of\nthe halftracks which I dimly, unfondly, remembered from my tironut. A few of\nthe AMXs led the way, then a line of halftracks, and more tanks at the rear. I\nnosed our Jeep into the middle, behind the battalion commander, a lieutenantcolonel\nnamed Ze’ev Eitan. There were scattered groups of Egyptian soldiers on\neither side of us, and they aimed an occasional burst of fire in our direction. But\nthere seemed little point in shooting back. We didn’t need to fight, and it was\nclear that the Egyptians didn’t really want to.\nShortly before dark, Lieutenant-Colonel Eitan brought our column to halt.\nThe road we were on cut through tall sandunes on either side. We knew there\n90\nwere still Egyptian soldiers around us, though I doubt any of us expected\ntrouble. Still, there were well-established rules for setting up a defensible\nposition when an armored force halts for the night. As Eitan briefed his officers,\nI stood a few feet off to the side and listened. Suddenly, the commander of his\nAMX company interrupted. “Sir,” he said, “why are we staying here – right on\nthe main road? There are Egyptians still out there. Behind us, for sure. And any\nforce ahead of us will run straight into us. Why not a few hundred yards off to\nthe side, in a place that gives us a view of any enemy movement, or allows us to\nambush an approaching force?” I could see that he was right. I expected Eitan to\nagree and alter the arrangements. But he didn’t. I think that, having ordered his\nmen to encamp on the road 20 minutes earlier, he was reluctant to get his tanks\nand halftracks moving again. No doubt, some of the exhausted crews were\nalready asleep.\nI parked our Jeep a few yards off the road. We organized a series of watches:\nAvraham, then Rafi and Danny, with me taking the pre-dawn stretch. A few\nhours later, Rafi nudged me awake. “I heard something,” he said, pointing west\ntoward the Suez Canal. “It was faint. But I think so.” I told him to keep\nlistening. For a while, everything seemed fine. Then, Danny woke me up. He\nsaid he was sure he heard a faint tremor, as if from tanks or APCs. I put my ear\nto the ground. I heard it too. I told him to go to Eitan’s command halftrack,\ninsist he be woken up, and tell him. When he got back, Danny said: “I told\nhim.”\n“And?”\n“Don’t know,” he replied. “He said I could go.” I tried to grab a bit more\nsleep before my watch. But barely 15 minutes later, Danny jostled me awake\nagain. “I’m sure now,” he said. “Whatever it is, it’s closer.” I went off to find\nEitan. But before I got there, a column of Egyptian T-55 tanks suddenly\nappeared on the road, 50 yards from the front of our column. I’m sure they were\nevery bit as surprised as we were to be face-to-face with enemy armor. But they\nknew what to do. They opened fire.\nHad we been deployed a few hundred yards off the road, we’d have seen\nthem coming. If the battalion commander had acted on Danny’s warning, we’d\nhave had an extra 20 minutes to prepare. But the shells jolted our crews awake.\nWithin 30 seconds, they were returning fire. But our tanks barely dented the\nheavily armored T- 55s. Nearly every one of theirs seemed to score a direct hit.\nWithin minutes, a number of our halftracks, and one of our tanks, were in\nflames.\n91\nNow that we were in a fight –the single fiercest battle in Israel’s advance\nacross the Sinai – Lieutenant-Colonel Eitan reacted swiftly. Standing tall amid the\nshellfire and the flames, he radioed for supporting fire, only to be told that none of\nour artillery batteries was within range. Realizing we couldn’t penetrate the\nfront armor of the Egyptian tanks, he ordered a platoon from the rear to leave\nthe road and fire on the Egyptians’ from their flank. When one T-55 was hit and\nstarted to burn, he ordered the rest of us to collect the dead and wounded and\nretreat toward Bir Gafgafa.\nAs we pulled back, we encountered a company of Centurion tanks from the\nSeventh Brigade, sent in to relieve us. We pulled off the road to let them pass.\nThe battle ended up raging for another hour. By the time it was over, the\nEgyptian tank unit was nearly destroyed. But almost two dozen of Eitan’s\nreservists had been killed. A few days later, I learned that the commander of the\nCenturions had also been killed. His name was Shamai Kaplan. Though I didn’t\nknow him personally, he was married to one of my kibbutz “sisters” from\nMishmar Hasharon.\n* * *\nThe pace of the war, its intensity, and the transformative capture of territory\nacross our 1948 borders had accelerated dramatically since we’d joined the\nreserve battalion’s ill-fated advance toward the canal. Back at Bir Gafgafa, we\nlearned that Israeli troops had broken through in fierce fighting with the\nJordanians and taken the whole of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and\nthe site of the remains of the ancient temple. The news sent a shiver down my\nspine. I was still only 25, a kibbutznik raised on the assertively secular creed of\nGordinian Zionism. But I was old enough to remember the war of 1948, the\nbitter struggle for the ancient city in which Judaism had been born, the packages\nof food we had sent to try to help break the siege there, and the division of\nJerusalem at the end of the war, leaving us with only its newer, western half.\nAnd while I may not have read the Torah in the same way as a religiously\nobservant Jew, the meaning of Jerusalem was no less powerful for me. It was\npart of our people’s history, of who we were, where we’d come from and how\nwe had ended up in the place where I’d been born, where I’d grown up, and\nwhich I’d spent the early part of my adult life defending. This was no less true\nof the biblical sites of Judaea and Samaria – the West Bank of the Jordan river.\n92\nPlaces like Bet El, Shiloh, or Hebron. They represented the historic wellspring\nnot just of the state we’d created, but of Jewish civilization, our heritage, our\nmoral and ethical foundation. As I drove back to Tel Aviv with Avraham and\nthe others on the morning of fourth day of the war, we heard Israeli ground\nforces were consolidating their hold there as well.\nAfter dropping Avraham at the kirya, we drove back to the sayeret base, but\nit was nearly empty. The main fighting was now with Syrian armored units on\nthe Golan Heights, and most of the men in the unit had gone north in the hope\nof joining what seemed likely to be the final stage of the war. Although the\nprecise outcome was not yet clear, there was a dawning certainty, almost\nsurreal, that\nIsrael was gaining control of all the areas across our 1948 borders from\nwhich the Arab states around us had shelled Israeli farming settlements, or\nfacilitated fedayeen attacks and ambushes against our citizens – the very border\nareas where I’d led intelligence operations in Sayeret Matkal.\nI, too, drove north. Not far from Kibbutz Dan, the staging point for our first\nGolan operation, I linked up with a group of other sayeret reservists. Israeli\ntanks had already broken the main resistance of the Syrians, but fighting was\ncontinuing in a few parts of the Golan. In the western corner of the Heights\nwhich bordered Lebanon, several villages still lay beyond the Israeli advance.\nWe got an order to see if we could take them. It took barely an hour, against no\nmore resistance than I’d met in “capturing” the Egyptians in the Sinai bunker.\nBy the time we had made our way back across the Golan to the now-abandoned\nSyrian headquarters in Quneitra, it was sunset. The war was drawing to a close.\nI gave my Jeep to a couple of paratroopers and hot-wired a more comfortable\nmode of transport back home: a big, black Mercedes which had obviously\nbelonged to a senior Syrian officer. If only because of the license plates, I\navoided the main road back into Israel. I found a dirt track running between\nSyrian positions on the southern edge of the Golan and descended toward the\nfruit groves of Kibbutz Ha’on, near the Sea of Galilee. I then headed for\nGivataim in north Tel Aviv, to a place I knew well. It was the home of\nMenachem Digli. He had been Avraham Arnan’s deputy in the sayeret when I\nleft for my stint in officers’ school. Before I returned to the unit, he had a\nmotorcycle accident, badly damaging his leg. He’d been temporarily reassigned\nto a post in intelligence. I figured a Syrian Mercedes would make a nice gift.\nNot wanting to wake him, I left it in front of his house. Sadly, he never got to\nuse it. The next day a couple of military policemen knocked on his door and\n93\nasked what he knew about the car outside. “Nothing,” he said. “It’s not mine.”\nThey took it away.\nAs insistently as I, and others in Sayeret Matkal, had wanted to play our part\non the battlefields of the Six-Day War – in the Sinai, on the Golan, in the bitter\nbattle to capture Jerusalem, or amid the olive-green hills and valleys of the West\nBank – we had to accept that, at most, we’d been freelance support troops. Or\nmere spectators. But while it would be many years before this was openly\nacknowedlged, we did play an important part in the outcome. Because Dayan\nhad been called back as Defense Minister only days before the war, he had\nwisely decided not to alter the plan for the preemptive air strikes. But he did\nadjust our ground advance. Just as with Eshkol’s knowledge of the initial\nEgyptian advance in the Sinai before the war, Dayan’s judgements were\ninformed by detailed, real-time intelligence on where enemy tanks and troops\nwere located, what they were doing, and what how and when they were\nplanning to advance.\nAs speculation mounted after the war about how Israel seemed to know so\nmuch the Arab forces, Meir Amit’s successor as Head of Military Intelligence,\nAhrahle Yariv, even engaged in some misdirection. He was anxious to avoid\njeopardizing future sayeret bugging operations. In a speech on how the war had\nbeen won, he included a reference to a “high-ranking spy” in the Egyptian army\nwho, he implied, had leaked critical information. The “spy” was the series of\nintercepts we’d attached to the Egyptians’ main military communications\nnetwork in the Sinai, and to the telephone poles on the Golan Heights.\nOn a deeply personal level, too, the war left its mark on Sayeret Matkal.\nThough the fighting had been brief, people did die. Thousands of Egyptians,\nSyrians and Jordanians. And about 650 Israelis. Some of were not just people\nwe knew. They included close friends. Nechemia Cohen, the officer I’d joined in\nour failed attempt to defuse the booby-trap in the Sinai before the war, entered\nGaza on the first day in his new role as deputy commander of Amsalem’s\nparatroop unit. Amsalem was killed early on, so Nechemia took command. He\nwas shot and killed fifteen minutes later. To this day, he and I share the\ndistinction of being the most decorated soldiers in Israel’s history. Had he lived,\nI have no doubt that it is an honor he would have held alone.\nThis was the first close friend from the unit we’d lost. We did not mourn him\nopenly. For young soldiers of my generation, especially but not only those raised\nwith the additional kibbutz ethos of stolid self-control, there was an embedded\nsense that such individual displays of emotion were an indulgence, and luxury\n94\neven, which the country we were building could not afford. In the early years of\nthe state, the model Israel mother or father were those who stood silent and strong\nas a soldier’s coffin was lowered into the ground.\nNechemia’s death hurt, of course. I was friends not just with him, but his older\nbrother, Eliezer. Known by his army nickname, Cheetah, he was in charge of the\nair force’s main helicopter squadron. He had flown both me and Nechemia on\nsayeret missions into the Sinai. Several days after the war was over, before\nreturning to university, I drove up to Jerusalem to see his family. Cheetah was at\nthe door when I arrived. Neither of us spoke. But as we embraced, I could feel\nmy eyes dampen, and there were tears in his eyes as well.\n“Our squadron was the one that got the call to bring out the casualties,” he\nsaid. “They ordered the pilot who brought out Nechemia not to tell me he was\ndead… until the war was over.”\n“He was a wonderful man,” I said. “There was no one better.”\n* * *\nWhen I returned to Hebrew University, the country felt completely different.\nIt was not just the sudden realization that, in military terms, Israel had\neliminated any realistic threat to its existence, important though that was. The\nmore profound change was physical. The country in which I’d grown up was a\nplace which felt not just small, but pinched, especially in its “narrow waist” near\nMishmar Hasharon. Pre-1967 Israel was about three-quarters the size of the\nstate of New Hampshire. Now, within the space of less than a week, the\nterritory Israel controlled had more than tripled. It included the whole Sinai\nDesert, up to the edge of the Suez Canal. The entire Golan. The ancient lands of\nJudaea and Samaria: the West Bank. And the reunited capital city of Jerusalem.\nSuddenly, we had a sense that we could breathe. Wander, explore. Few of\nmy classmates were religiously observant. But none of us could help feel the\nsense of connection as we walked through the Old City of Jerusalem, or parts of\nthe West Bank whose place-names resonated from the Bible. I felt especially\nmoved when I first visited the Old City with my friends, stopping and chatting\nand buying things at the colorful market stalls. And, religious or not, when I\nstood in front of the surviving Western Wall of the ancient Jewish temple.\n95\nThe personal interactions we had with Palestinians in the weeks after the war\nwere without obvious tension, much less hostility. They were often friendly.\nLooking back, I’m sure that was one reason – along with simple human nature,\na desire to enjoy Israel’s new sense of both security and size – that none of us\nwas inclined to look too deeply, or too far ahead, and contemplate the\nimplications for our country’s future. I was aware, of course, that the politeness\nwe exchanged with the Palestinians of Jerusalem or the West Bank were\nsuperficial: a few words across a market stall or a restaurant counter. I did not\npretend to myself that our Arab neighbors were now suddenly inclined to be our\nfriends.\nBut I did feel that, having come face-to-face with our overwhelming military\nsupremacy, the Arab states would, over time, grant Israel simple acceptance.\nFrom there, I believed that we could begin the process of building genuine,\nlasting, human relationships and, eventually, peace.\nThere was a brief period after the war when Eshkol cautioned his ministers\nabout the implications of holding on to the vast new area we had conquered.\nThe government formally agreed to treat most of it, with the exception of\nJerusalem, as a “deposit” to be traded for the opening of peace talks. Yet within\nweeks, the emphasis in the Israeli political debate shifted to which parts we\nwould keep: the Sinai and the Golan almost certainly, as well as the Jordan\nValley and a number of areas of past Jewish settlement on the West Bank. The\ndrift away from any serious talk of trading land for peace was accelerated by the\nArab states’ response to the war. Perhaps that, too, was simply a matter of\nhuman nature, a reluctance on their part to accept defeat. But they appeared no\nmore ready than before to contemplate peace. Throughout the summer, there\nwere clashes along our new “border” with Egypt: the Suez Canal. In September,\nall the Arab states adopted a platform which became known as the “three no’s”.\nThey rejected not just the idea of peace, but peace talks, or recognition of the\nState of Israel. And in October, Egyptian missile boats attacked and sunk Israel’s\nlargest warship, the destroyer Eilat, killing nearly 50 people on board.\nWithout this renewed violence, perhaps, we in Israel might have been able to\nconsider more deeply the future implications of our victory in the Six-Day War.\nThe gains on the battlefield, of course, were clear to everyone. We were no\nlonger a small, constricted country beset by a sense of vulnerability. We were\nnot only much bigger, but also stronger than the combined armies of the Arab\nstates. Still, very few people asked themselves at the time what kind of Israel\nthis implied. We failed to grasp the potential complications in holding on to all\n96\nthe land, and of controlling the daily lives, however benignly, of the hundreds of\nthousands of Arabs who lived there. Nor, crucially, did we ponder the\nlimitations of military strength, alone, in addressing these questions. We – and I,\ntoo, at the time – were too caught up in a sense of post-war relief, celebration\nand, as the months of ostensible normalcy in this new Israel, complacency as\nwell.\nBut within only a few years, we would face a dramatically different series of\nchallenges. First, a campaign of Palestinian terror. Then, another full-scale war,\nwhich began with a surprise attack by Arab armies which we had assumed\nwould not dare to fight us again.\n97\nChapter Seven\nIf you’d visited Tel Aviv in July 1967, you would have sensed a new spirit\nof confidence, not cockiness exactly, but a sort of spring in the collective step.\nThis was not just due to the Six-Day War. It was because the city, if not yet the\nrest of the country, had shed the economic austerity of Israel’s first two decades\nand was beginning to experience at least some of the consumer comforts which\nWestern Europe, or America, took for granted. But we were still a decade away\nfrom the first shopping malls, or the upscale cafés and restaurants which\nnowadays give places like Dizengoff Street, a few blocks back from the\nseafront, the feel of London or Paris on a summer’s day. Television had been\nintroduced only a year before the war. Color TV was still nearly a decade away.\nI can’t say I was surprised to learn, when the archives were opened a few years\nago, that a committee of moral arbiters in our Ministry of Education vetoed\nplans for the Beatles to perform in the city. “No intrinsic artistic value,” they\npronounced. “And their concerts provoke mass hysteria.”\nEven in Tel Aviv, and certainly the rest of Israel, a kind of cultural austerity\nstill prevailed, an emphasis on modesty and self-restraint. It was a legacy of\n1948, a reflection of the years of shared sacrifice, physical labor, and the lifeand-death\nstruggles which I, like most Israelis at the time, had experienced\nwithin our own lifetimes. That may help explain why I can remember no one\nremarking on an aspect of my character which, once I rose to public\nprominence, would attract attention, frequent comment, and sometimes\ncriticism as well: the fact that I seemed so self-contained, reluctant to engage\nemotionally with people beyond a circle of close friends or confidants. My lack\nof smalltalk, and the kind of gladhanding and schmoozing that are the currency\nof political life. At the time of the 1967 war, I was not yet a public figure. Yet to\nthe extent those around me would have taken note – family, university\nclassmates, sayeret comrades, or officers in the kirya – my slight emotional\naloofness, my focus on simply getting things done, and the way I internalized\nsetbacks, even tragedies like the death of Nechemia Cohen, was not exceptional.\nIt was, in many ways, simply Israeli.\nYet as Israel, Israeli society and my place in them changed, it would be\nsuggested to me more than once – not always kindly, when it was from critics or\nrivals – that I had a “touch of Aspbergers” in me, a reference to those on the\nmore benign reaches of the autism spectrum with a special facility for math,\n98\nabstract ideas, the theoretical sciences and, often, music as well. I would always\nsmile in response, suggesting that such diagnoses were probably best left to the\nprofessionals. I couldn’t pretend, however, that emotional engagement with new\nacquaintances, even with people I knew and liked but were not close friends,\nwas something that came naturally. And it is also true that from my first\nexperience of the world of numbers as a child on the kibbutz, and as I tackled\never more elaborate pieces on the piano, I did become aware of what might be\ncalled the upside of “a touch of Aspergers” – if that, indeed, is what it is. I was\nconscious of the ease with which my brain translated the complexities into\npictures in my mind. And the joy, at times, with which it allowed me to play\naround with, and develop, what I saw.\nBy the summer of 1967, I had experienced that feeling again, in my first real\nencounter with theoretical physics at Hebrew University. After the Six-Day\nWar, I began seriously contemplating a future as a research scientist, or perhaps\neventually a professor of physics. Two months after the war, I enrolled in a\nsummer program at the Weizmann Institute, Israel’s preeminent postgraduate\nresearch facility. Surrounded by some of the country’s, even the world’s,\nleading scientists, and by post-doctoral students determined to follow in their\nfootsteps, was intellectually enthralling. But it turned out to have another effect\non me as well. As I thought more and more about the prospect of joining their\nfraternity once I’d completed my undergraduate degree, I also heard them\ndescribe the way in which pure science sometimes got submerged in simple\nroutine, or, more discouragingly, in the politics and positioning and backbiting\nof the academic world.\nI think what finally changed my mind, however, was a feeling, nurtured on\nthe kibbutz but solidified by that many nights I’d spent leading sayeret\noperations across our borders, that I would find my true purpose in life trying to\nmake some special contribution to the future course of Israel. I did not for a\nmoment contemplate politics at that point. Instead, I thought of going back into\nthe military. I realized that in order to make a significant mark, if indeed I\ncould, would require me to serve in the regular army, not just an extraordinary\nunit like Sayeret Matkal. But I did hope that, at some stage, I’d be given the\nopportunity to finish my time in the sayeret as its commander, carrying on\nAvraham’s vision and, ideally, building and expanding on it as well. At least if\nthat part proved possible, I felt that, by comparison, a career in academia would\nbe somehow blinkered, and surely less fulfilling personally. My sayeret\nexperience had also taught me something else as well: that protecting Israel’s\nsecurity was not just a matter of muscle, or firepower, indispensible though they\n99\nsometime were. It called for mental application, an ability to assess risks, to find\nanswers under enormous pressure when, inevitably, things went wrong. It\nrequired not just brawn, but brains.\nA week before I began my final year at Hebrew University, I went to see Eli\nZeira, the senior intelligence officer who’d so brashly predicted the course of\nthe Six-Day War, in hopes of sounding out my prospects of picking up my\nmilitary career where I’d left off. Despite a yawning gap in rank and age – Eli\nwas nearly fifteen years older – I felt I could be open with him. Not only did I\nknow him from Sayeret Matkal, which came under his purview in the kirya. He\nwas a scientist manqué and was eager, as soon as I arrived in his office, to hear\nabout my physics studies. When I did manage to turn the conversation to the\narmy, I told him I was thinking of returning after I graduated. Yet before finally\ndeciding, I wanted his honest opinion about my chances, at some point, of being\ngiven command of the sayeret. He began with a series of caveats. The choice of\nfuture leaders of the sayeret was not be his to make. When the current\ncommander, Uzi Yairi, ended his term in roughly 18 months’ time, I’d still be\ntoo young to have a realistic chance. “Maybe even next time around,” he said.\nAnd in any case, I would first need to get some experience in the regular army.\n“But then,” he concluded, “my opinion is that you have a very good chance of\nbecoming commander of the unit.” That was more than enough. I figured that\nwhether it actually happened would now ultimately be down to me.\nMy last year at university was the closest thing I would have to a normal\nstudent existence. I was called away only once. But it was for a battle which\nwould turn out to have a lasting impact on the course of our conflict with the\nArabs, and on the prospects of eventually finding a way to make peace. It was\nIsrael’s largest military action since the war, across our new de facto border with\nJordan. And it was directed at a new enemy: a fledgling army of Palestinian\nfedayeen, called Fatah. It was led by a man that I, like almost all Israelis, had\nnever heard of at the time: Yasir Arafat. Born in Egypt, as a 19-year-old he had\nfought against the establishment of Israel in the 1948 war. Although Fatah had\nnominally existed for nearly a decade, it was only now emerging as a political\nforce, in large part because of the Arab armies’ humiliating defeat in the Six-\nDay War. A Palestinian political leadership already existed, in the shape of the\nPalestine Liberation Ogranization. But it was based in Cairo. Its chairman was,\nfor all practical purposes, an adjunct of President Nasser’s leadership role in the\nArab world. Though Arafat had not yet explicitly challenged this state of affairs,\nhis, and Fatah’s, rise after the war carried a powerful, message for the existing\nArab presidents and prime ministers: their brash promises of victory before the\n100\n1967 war had turned out to be hollow words. It was time for a new generation,\nand a new, more direct, form of confrontation with the “Zionist enemy.”\nArafat had set up camp with nearly a thousand men just across the Jordan\nRiver, in a town called Karameh. From early 1968, they had been launching hitand-run\nraids, not just on the West Bank but into the Negev. Eshkol’s cabinet\nwas initially divided on whether to attack his base in Jordan, in both an act of\nretaliation and a signal to King Hussein that if his army didn’t rein in Arafat’s\nmen, Israel would take whatever action necessary. But the decisive moment\ncame on the eighteenth of March. A school bus near Eilat, in the far south of\nIsrael, hit a Fatah landmine, killing the driver and a teacher, and injuring 10 of\nthe children.\nI was called up the night before the Israeli attack, as part of a small Sayeret\nMatkal contingent which was supposed to play a support role. An enormous\npincer operation was mounted around the Fatah camp and Karameh itself:\nincluding a full infantry brigade, the Seventh Armored Brigade and the\nparatroopers’ sayeret. But the resistance they met, both from Fatah and\nJordanian troops, was much fiercer than expected. One of the paratroop\ncommandos, Mookie Betzer, who would go on to join Sayeret Matkal, told me\nhow they landed by helicopter and immediately came under a hail of AK-47\nfire. Within minutes, several of his men had been killed. Mookie was wounded.\nThe tanks of the Seventh Brigade advanced from the south. Battling the\nJordanian army, they took losses as well. Amnon Lipkin, who would also later\nbecome a friend and colleague, in both the army and Israeli politics, was in\ncommand of a unit of lightly armored French tanks called AMLs. They, too,\nwere hopelessly outgunned.\nOur sayeret assignment was to block the southern entrance to Karameh as\nthe Israeli armored force advanced. But we got bogged down in mud as we\nmade our way from the Jordan River. By the time we arrived, hundreds of\nArafat’s men had already fled the area. Arafat, too, had escaped, on the back of a\nmotorcycle.\nBy the time the fighting was over, some two hundred Fatah fighters had been\nkilled. But nearly 30 Israeli soldiers lost their lives as well, and more than twice\nthat number were wounded. Politically, the outcome was even murkier. Most of\nIsrael was still basking in our victory in the Six-Day War. Now, we had\ndeployed many of the same units, only to fight to what looked like a costly\ndraw. Arafat and Fatah could claim – and soon did – that they had stood and\nfought, and inflicted losses on the victors of 1967.\n101\n* * *\nIn retrospect, given all the interruptions, I’m a little surprised that I managed\nto get through my university studies. My classmates helped. They were\nincredibly generous in going through with me what I’d missed, and sharing their\nnotes, whenever I returned for an extended stint of reserve duty. I’ve seen\ninterviews with university friends saying I was one of the top students in our\nclass. But that is more generous than true. It would be fairer to say I was a good\nstudent.Working hard in the final year, I did finish in the upper quarter of the\nclass, and several of my math and science professors strongly urged me to go on\nto graduate school.\nBut my mind was made up on returning to the army. And as I balanced my\nstudies with plans for the future during my final months, I still hadn’t given up\nhope that Nili would be there with me. When she returned from Paris, we had\nstarted seeing each other again. Whenever I could, I would take the bus down to\nTel Aviv and spend the weekend with her. Everything I’d loved about her since\nthat first meeting in the kirya, everything I valued in our relationship, was still\nthere. Yet so, too, were the doubts: whether she was ready to commit herself to\nsharing our lives together; and whether a kibbutznik like me could ever truly fit\nin to her Tel Avivi world. Shortly before Karameh, she’d invited me to a Fridaynight\nparty with a group of her friends. It was the first time she was including\nme, as part of a couple, in her social circle. But almost from the moment we got\nthere, I felt out of place. For her, it was just another party, one of dozens she\nmust have been to since she was a teenager. But I immediately felt out of place.\nI didn’t drink. I couldn’t dance. I couldn’t help feeling like a wallflower, or an\nalien presence.\nNow, I decided there was no point in waiting and wondering. I borrowed a\nJeep from an army friend, with the idea that Nili and I could spend three or four\ndays together, driving south from Jerusalem into the Negev and the Judean\ndesert: to be alone, to talk, to see whether we actually had a future. I wrote her a\nnote, took the bus to Tel Aviv while she was at work, and dropped it through the\nletterbox. “I am going on this trip, into the desert,” it said. “I’d love it if you\ncould come with me. I think it’s important for us.”\nI never heard back. I felt crushed, though I tried hard to tell myself it was\nbetter to know where we stood. Years later, she told me the envelope had ended\n102\nup under a pile of mail. She hadn’t seen it until a week afterwards. She said that\nof course she would have come with me. She felt angry with herself, and with\nme too, for not simply having phoned. But since I didn’t contact her in the\nweeks that followed, she figured this was just another one of our times apart. Or\n“stupid pride”. A few months later, I heard she was engaged to be married, to a\nyoung man she’d known since their high school days at the Alliance.\nI had first met Nava Cohen, the woman I would go on to marry, the previous\nyear. It was through another Cohen, though they were not related: Nechemia,\nmy sayeret friend who was killed in the 1967 war. He invited me to Tel Aviv\nfor a party in the spring, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, and introduced us.\nNava was just nineteen, five years younger than me. I was struck not just by the\nfact she was attractive, but by her poise, warm-heartedness, and her obvious\nintelligence. But she had her boyfriend with her, and I still saw myself and Nili\nas life partners. Now, she was beginning her studies at Hebrew University as\nwell, and, in a way, it was again Nechemia\nCohen who brought us together. Since his death, those of us who knew him\nfrom the sayeret had been looking for a fitting way to remember and to honor\nhim. We finally decided to set up a living memorial in his name: a Moadon\nSayarim, a center to train young people from all over Jerusalem in scouting and\nnavigation. We spent six months getting it up and running, and Nava pitched in\nwith the work.\nIt wasn’t until a few months after I heard of Nili’s engagement that I finally\nasked her on a date. We were in the university library, which had a space where\nyou could listen to tapes through headphones. I would go to hear classical\nmusic. Nava was studying English literature, and I’d sometimes see her there,\nengrossed in recordings of Shakespeare with the text of Hamlet or Macbeth in\nfront of her. Since I wasn’t shackled by the need to follow the alacks and\nalasses, I read the newspaper as the music washed over me. I turned to the\nmovie section. I circled three films, drew a question mark in the margin and\npassed it to her. She looked puzzled for a second. Then she smiled and put a\ncheckmark next to one of them.\nWhile we came from different backgrounds, the gap was narrower than it\nhad been with Nili. Her parental home was in Tiberias. Her parents were from\nold Sephardi families, with a centuries-long history in Palestine, and were also\nsolid Ben-Gurion Labor supporters. Her father had fought in the British army in\nthe Second World War. He now ran the branch of Bank Leumi in Tiberias. Her\nmother ran a shop in what was then the city’s best hotel, the Ginton.\n103\nWe were married there, in the spring of 1969. My parents and brothers came\nwith two busloads of friends from the kibbutz. Avraham Arnan was there, of\ncourse. But Ahraleh Yariv and Eli Zeira, two of the military intelligence heroes\nof the Six-Day War, also drove up for the wedding, which touched both Nava\nand me, not to mention her family and our guests. Years later, as I rose higher in\nthe ranks of the military, I would sometimes be invited to weddings by officers\nunder my command. Remembering how much we appreciated Ahraleh’s and Eli\nZeira’s gesture. I always said yes.\n* * *\nIt was only weeks after our wedding that I formally returned to Sayeret\nMatkal. Both Nava and I were aware of the additional pressures my military\ncommitments might place on our family life. But she understood why I’d\nchosen to go back, and was supportive. As for me, I was, if anything, more\ncertain that I’d made the right decision. Israel was clearly facing a whole new\nset of challenges to its security. Given the decisiveness, and speed, of our\nvictory in 1967, there seemed no immediate danger of Egypt’s risking another\nfull-scale war. In Israel, where Golda Meir had become Prime Minister after\nEshkol’s death from a heart attack, there was also little appetite for returning to\nthe battlefield. Yet the post-war skirmishes with the Egyptians along the Suez\nCanal had escalated into far more than that: what would become known as the\nWar of Attrition. Nor could there be any doubt, after Karameh, that Fatah’s\ninfluence, militancy and determination would only grow, not least because even\nmore radical factions within the PLO were ready to step into the breach if\nArafat faltered. Israel needed to find an answer for all these threats.\nUzi Yairi’s term as Sayeret Matkal commander had by now ended, but his\nsuccessor was someone I knew well. Menachem Digli was the officer on whom\nI’d bestowed my stolen Syrian Mercedes at the end of the war. His leg was now\nrecovered from the motorcycle accident, and I returned to the sayeret at his\ndeputy. He delegated full responsibility to me for operational issues. I believed\nthat the new kind of challenges we were confronting, particularly the prospect\nof intensified attacks from the new generation of Palestinian fedayeen, meant\nthat the sayeret would sooner or later have to broaden its reach, moving beyond\nthe kind of intelligence operations we’d done before the 1967 war to become\nthe SAS-like special forces unit Avraham ultimately envisaged. But that was not\n104\ngoing to happen soon, if only because the intelligence missions now required\nwere going to be a lot tougher. Israel now had control of the entire Sinai and the\nGolan. To tap into enemy communications, we would have to push deeper\ninside Egypt and Syria.\nSoon after my return, we began planning the sayeret’s most ambitious\nmission so far: targeting the main communications system between Suez City,\nat the southern end of the canal, and Egyptian military headquarters in Cairo.\nWe were obviously going to have to go in by helicopter. But we faced not just\nthe risk of being spotted on the way in. The buildup of Egyptian forces along\nthe canal now included Soviet-made anti-aircraft missile batteries. We might\neasily get shot down.\nThe mission struck the generals in the kirya as so risky as to border on the\ninsane. But I was confident that we could make it work. I began talking to the\nfew senior air force officers who seemed more receptive, as well as to officers\nin the helicopter units. Not only had I flown into the Sinai on earlier missions. I\nnow also had a physics degree. Together, we developed a plan – using the desert\nterrain, and drawing on the helicopters’ maneuverability – to calculate a flight\nroute that could avoid detection by Egyptian radar. As an extra fail-sale, I\nproposed using three helicopters, and three sayeret teams. Two would fly\nslightly higher, with the express aim of getting spotted, but still evading missile\nfire. They would land far away from the real target of the operation. The main\nteam, with me in command, would also stage a pair of diversionary attacks:\nplanting explosives on a high-voltage electricity cable, and on the main oil\npipeline from Suez City to Cairo.\nStill, for many weeks, the answer from the kirya was no. The man who had\nsucceeded Rabin as chief-of-staff after the war, Chaim Bar-Lev, dismissed it as\n“a plan built on chicken legs.” In the end, what got us the green light was a\nfurther escalation, on both sides, in the War of Attrition. In January 1970, Israeli\nwarplanes began a series of deep-penetration bombing raids, for the first time\nstriking targets dozens of miles, in some case hundreds of miles, back from the\ncanal. The Israeli bombing campaign reduced the chance we’d get shot down and\nprovided cover for our operation.\nOur helicopters took off after sunset, nearly skimming the water and peeling\noff in separate directions on the far shore. The other two aircraft headed 120\nmiles to the south. I led the main team of ten men. We set down a few miles\nsouth of the road from Suez City to Cairo. We unloaded a pair of Jeeps, drove\noff, and within an hour had placed our time-delay explosives on the electricity\n105\ntower and the pipeline. But when we reached the site of the underground\ncommunications cable, the mission literally ran into the ground. We dug for\nmore than two hours, but still hadn’t found the cable, and our mail-order metal\ndetector stubbornly refused to chirp out any sign of it.\nJust when I’d decided to call the helicopter back in to get us, it finally\npeeped a faint signal. I still wasn’t convinced, but as we manipulated it back and\nforth, it got louder. Still, my instinct was to abort. We’d placed the explosives\non the electricity tower and the pipeline. That would at least divert attention\nfrom our real mission, which meant we could return in a few months and have\nanother attempt. After all, the part of the operation that had been causing the\nmost concern in the kirya – our ability to get deep inside Egypt undetected –\nhad succeeded. We were nearly three hours behind schedule. Unless we worked\na lot more quickly than planned, by the time we installed the communications\nintercept and covered our tracks, it would be daybreak.\nDigli and several other sayeret officers were following the mission from\ntheir command post in the Sinai, part of the intelligence base our military\nengineers had built after the war into a 2,400-feet-high mountain called Gebel\nUm-Hashiba, 20 miles back from the Suez Canal. When I radioed in to tell him\nI’d decided to abandon the operation, I could hear the surprise in his voice, and\nwhat seemed reluctance as well. “If that’s your judgement…” he said. But\nbefore I could reply that, yes, I felt withdrawal was the wisest course, I heard\nhim speaking to someone whose voice I also recognized: Avsha Horan. He was\nthe soldier on guard duty in the command post for our first intercept operation\nin the Sinai, the one who’d told me of how Rabin was chain-smoking and biting\nhis nails when it appeared we might be in trouble. Now, he was a sayeret\nofficer. Digli came back on the radio. “We can see more from here,” he said.\nThen, pausing, he added: “Avsha says he thinks you can still do it.”\nI had grown to respect Avsha’s judgement. And while Digli hadn’t explained\nwhat “more” they saw from the command post, I assumed that, since they were\nalso following the other helicopter teams further south, they were concerned\nthat the Egyptians had figured out at least that Israeli units were involved. Both\nhe and I knew that it ultimately had to be my call. Whatever happened, I’d be\nresponsible. Yet I realized that discussing it further would change nothing, and\ntime was now what mattered most. “We’ll do it,” I told him, and signed off.\nWe’d planned for the cable work to take something like five hours, which I\nknew we couldn’t afford. With all of us pitching in, sweat drenching our\n“Egyptian” uniforms, we managed to finish in slightly less than four. But we\n106\nwere still behind schedule. Dawn was 25 minutes away. I radioed the helicopter\npilot with a new pickup point, closer to where we’d installed the equipment\nthough still far enough, I hoped, to avoid giving away what we’d done. Still, we\nbarely made it. The sun was rising as the chopper began weaving among the\ndunes and wadis on the flight back to Israel. Looking back, we could see flames\nleaping up from the oil pipeline in the dim, dawn light.\nThere could be no doubt the prize was worth it. By the time we returned, the\nreceiving equipment at Um-Hashiba was, for the first time, picking up real-time\ncommunications at the highest level of the Egyptian military. With the War of\nAttrition showing every sign of getting even fiercer, it was a criticial\nintelligence advantage. When we landed, not only Digli, but Ahrale Yariv were\nthere to meet us. Digli, smiling broadly, handed me a small cloth insignia.\n“You’ve earned it,” he said, adding that Bar-Lev himself had endorsed my\npromotion from captain to major.\n* * *\nWith the Cairo-Suez mission, and a series of other operations I helped run\nnearer to the canal, there now seemed every possibility that I would be chosen\nto succeed Digli as commander when his term expired. But that was still more\nthan a year away, in the spring of 1971. With his agreement, I decided to use the\ntime to do what Eli Zeira had advised me before I made my decision to return:\nto get experience in the regular army. The War of Attrition had created a\ndemand for qualified officers who could command tank units, since they were\nplaying a key role against the Egyptians along the canal. Along with about a\ndozen other middle-ranking officers who had volunteered to move into the\narmored corps, I embarked on a course covering every facet of tank warfare:\nhow each system on an individual tank worked, how to pilot one, load in the\nshells, and then calibrate its main gun, aim and fire. We studied\ncommunications protocols, even tank maintenance. We were taught how to\ncommand an armored platoon – a group of three tanks – and then an armored\ncompany of eleven tanks and APCs. Finally, in July 1970, we were given\ncommand of actual companies, with the aim of deploying us against the\nEgyptians.\nMy company was part of Brigade 401, in the Sinai. It was one of the several\narmored forces that were rotated, every three months, into action on the front\n107\nline. In a stroke of good fortune, the brigade commander was Dovik Tamari,\nAvraham Arnan’s first successor as commander of the sayeret. While we waited\nour forward deployment, due in September, he included me in his discussions\nwith his senior officers on tactics and planning. This inevitably included the\ncore of our existing strategy: a line of fixed fortifications which we had built on\nour side of the canal after the war. They were known as the Bar-Lev Line,\nbecause the chief of staff ultimately had to sign off on them. But the main\nimpetus had come from Avraham Adan. A former Palmachnik, known as Bren,\nhe was the overall head of the armored corps.\nThere were strong critics of the Bar-Lev line, but few more vocal than Arik\nSharon. The very qualities that had made him the perfect choice to lead Unit\n101 and its successor commando units – a natural instinct to favor bold,\npreemptive attacks, allied with an absolute confidence in his own judgment and\nlittle time for those who challenged it – had stalled his rise up the military\nladder for a few years. But now he was head of Israel’s southern command. He\nwas convinced that in the event of another full-scale war with Egypt, the Bar-\nLev line would be worse than useless. We’d find ourselves forced to defend a\nstring of fortifications that could serve no real purpose in repelling a concerted\nEgyptian attempt to retake the Sinai. Arik’s preferred strategy was to let the\nEgyptian troops cross the canal and then confront them on terms where Israeli\nforces had a proven advantage: a mobile battle in the open desert.\nWhen the debate came up in our brigade strategy discussions, I said I\nbelieved Arik was right. From our recent sayeret missions, I said there was no\nway the Bar-Lev fortifications could protect us. I knew how easy it had been for\nus to operate unseen between Egyptian positions across the canal, and they were\nonly a few hundred yards apart. On some parts of the Bar-Lev line, there were\nsix or seven miles between outposts. A whole Egyptian brigade could pass\nthrough.\nVery few in the kirya, however, seemed ready to recalibrate our strategy\nagainst the Egyptians. Only later, when the damage had already been done,\nwould it become clear that the navy was alone in acting on lessons learned from\nthe fighting since the 1967 war. Having lost its largest warship to a more mobile\nEgyptian missile boat at the outset of the War of Attrition, it began focusing on\ndeploying mobile missile boats of its own. But the air force was showing no\nsign of dealing with the implications of the Egyptians’ increased anti-aircraft\ncapability – even though we’d begun losing planes and pilots to the new\nsurface-to-air missile batteries Nasser had received from the Soviets. And I\n108\ncould see that a similar myopia, or denial, was affecting the armored corps. On\npatrol along the canal, I would sometimes see the hulk of an Israeli tank which\nhad been destroyed by Soviet-made AT-3s. Known as Saggers, they were\nportable, allowing a single soldier to fire wire-guided missiles. Their range was\nnearly a mile-and-a-half, which was more than the main guns on our tanks. Yet\nno one appeared to have addressed the question of what would happen if the\nEgyptians used Saggers on an even greater scale in a future war.\nI remained in the Sinai through early 1971, but never led my tank company\non combat operations. By the time we were due for our deployment, the War of\nAttrition was suddenly over. Neither we nor the Egyptians wanted a return to\nfull-scale war. With Washington taking the lead, a cease-fire was agreed. Both\nsides claimed victory. But both were exhausted. Certainly, most Israelis had\nceased to see a compelling reason for the 1,000 days of fighting. We had lost\nabout 900 dead: more than in the Six-Day War.\nBut in one respect, the Egyptians won. Under the terms of the truce, their\nanti-aircraft batteries were barred from a roughly 30-mile strip along the canal.\nWithin days of the truce, however, Nasser began moving his SAM batteries\nforward. Before long, there were nearly 100 missile sites in the “prohibited”\nzone, giving the Egyptians control of 20 miles or more of the airspace on our\nside of the canal. Golda was incensed. So was Bar-Lev. But there was no way,\nand no will, to reopen the fighting and force Nasser to move the missiles back.\nThe cease-fire took effect at midnight on August 7, 1970. I’ve never had\ntrouble recalling the date, because of a phone call almost exactly 24 hours later.\nIt was from my mother-in-law, to tell me Nava had gone into labor with our first\nchild. Since I was due for deployment on the front line, we had agreed weeks\nearlier that the best thing would be for her to have the baby in Tiberias, so her\nparents could be with her. Now, I got a Jeep and raced north. I reached Tiberias\nthe next morning. I opened the door to the hospital room and saw Nava,\nobviously tired but beaming, cradling our daughter Michal in her arms.\nI managed to stay with them for several days before returning to the Sinai.\nWith Nava and Michal soon settled back into our apartment in the north Tel\nAviv neighborhood of Ramat Aviv, I made weekend visits home whenever I\ncould. Still, I saw nowhere near as much of our daughter’s first few months as\nmost fathers. As Nava and I would discover even more jarringly over the next\nfew years, that was an inescapable part of being an army officer.\n109\nBut at least my next posting was closer to home. It was only 20 minutes from\nour apartment, on a former RAF base not far from Lod airport. On the First of\nApril 1971, I was promoted from major to lieutenant-colonel, and given the\nassignment which, more than any other, I’d hoped for when I returned to the\narmy.\nI became the commander of Sayeret Matkal.\n110\nChapter Eight\nIt was the same jumble of buildings in the same corner of the base where I’d\nreported a decade earlier, as a 19-year-old fresh from tironut, when the sayeret\nwas still a gleam in Avraham Arnan’s eye. Now, I was about to become the first\nof his successors to have been chosen from within the unit itself. As I called\ntogether the officers that first morning, I couldn’t be sure whether I would make\na success of my two years in command. But I did know what I hoped that I, and\nwe, would accomplish: to complete Avraham’s vision. To forge a true specialforces\nunit, at a time when the threats facing Israel seemed increasingly to\ndemand one.\nAvraham’s initial hopes and expectations for the unit had been more than\nmet. Sayeret Matkal had played the key role in erasing the traumas of Uri Ilan\nand Rotem, and restoring the morale and effectiveness of Israeli military\nintelligence. Time and again, operations which we said we could do – dismissed\nas too dangerous, or impossible, by others – proved achievable. Yet as I now\ntold the team leaders and our other officers, this was no longer enough.\nOur intelligence operations still mattered. In fact, we would have to “push\nfurther” across Arab borders, deeper into enemy communications systems. Our\nintercepts had given Israel an important edge in the Six-Day War. I assumed –\nthough naively, it would turn out – that they would be put to use in any future\nwar. But if the sayeret was to retain its unique role, we had to become a fighting\nforce as well. One reason, I didn’t even have to mention: we all remembered our\nfrustration in 1967, when we’d been little more than bit players in the most\nimportant conflict since the establishment of the state. But for me, the main\nargument for change was what had happened since the 1967 war: the fact that\nIsrael was facing a new range of security challenges which other army units,\ntrained to engage and defeat enemy troops on the battlefield, were not equipped\nto meet.\nIn the War of Attrition, we might not have lost a single inch of territory. But\nwe had lost tanks and planes. Israeli soldiers and pilots were being held prisoner\nin Egypt and Syria. Arafat’s Fatah and the other armed Palestinian groups might\nnot present a conventional threat. Yet while I’d been with my tank company in\nthe Sinai, they were fighting a full-scale civil war against King Hussein’s army\nin Jordan. The catalyst: a multiple hijacking in September 1970, a sign that they\nwere turning to non-conventional warfare, and to acts of terror.\n111\n“We’re not starting from scratch,” I assured the sayeret officers, and I could\nsee some of them nodding in agreement. We had a proven record of success,\nunder Avraham and the four other commanders before me. We would be able to\nrely on the qualities that had proved our doubters wrong in our first intelligence\nmissions. “We have to stay true to the spirit of Sayeret Matkal,” I said. Every\none of the officers knew what I meant: teamwork, the way we valued brains and\ncreativity, more than formal lines of authority. The rigor we applied to training\nfor, preparing for, and executing each mission. And, no less importantly, to\ncriticizing, and trying to fix, everything that had gone wrong on an operation, or\nwe’d failed to anticipate.\nThough I expected to be leading many of the operations myself, I knew that\nwe’d succeed or fail on the strengths of the officers around me. I was incredibly\nfortunate on that score. Some, I already knew well from my time as Digli’s\ndeputy. Smart, self-confident, self-starting officers like Amiram Levin, the\nstocky kibbutznik from the north with whom I’d worked most closely and most\noften as deputy. Avshalom Horan – Avsha – who’d convinced me to risk\ncompleting the mission on the road from Suez to Cairo. Giora Zorea, who, like\nme, had come up through the unit and was one of our most experienced team\nleaders. And Danny Yatom. Born not far from Mishmar Hasharon, but a city\nboy, from Netanya, he was smart, level-headed and a sure-handed organizer,\nand with whom I’d somehow clicked from time he arrived in the sayeret. I made\nhim my deputy for my first year in command.\nThere were two others as well, both related to Moshe Dayan, but with a selfassurance\nall their own: Uzi Dayan, the son of Moshe’s brother, who had been\nkilled in the 1948 war when Uzi was only months old; and Mookie Betzer, who\nwas married to Uzi’s cousin. I’m not sure which of the two joined the sayeret\nfirst. Mookie, I believe. But their family ties, far from extraordinary, were part\nof how Sayeret Matkal had developed from the start. It had been friends\nbringing friends. But also, not infrequently, a cousin bringing a cousin, or a\nbrother bringing a brother.\nThis was the case with two other officers, whom I knew less well at first but\nwho would become key members of my team. In their case, it was the younger\none who joined first. Binyamin Netanyahu – Bibi, as everyone called him – had\nbeen a member of Amiram Levin’s team when I was Digli’s deputy. He’d also\nbeen a part of one of our several – thankfully harmless – failures along the canal\nat the beginning of the War of Attrition. The plan was to cross in rubber boats\nheld together by nylon cord, with the assistance of Shayetet 13, Israel’s\n112\nequivalent of the American navy SEALs. But Bibi’s dinghy got tangled up, and\nhe found himself in the canal, being tugged down by the current. Only the\nSEALs, and Bibi’s mix of calm and endurance, averted disaster.\nWhen I returned as commander, Bibi had gone through officers’ school and\nwas given a team of his own, making him one of half-a-dozen core, operational\nofficers with whom I worked from the planning stages of every mission,\nthrough the training and the operation itself. Especially with Bibi, since he was\nnewest to the role. He was smart, tough and, even by sayeret standards,\nsupremely self-confident. It also was clear that he understood my determination\nto build the unit into a military strike force – which was one reason why he\nurged me to bring in his older brother. Bibi was 22 at the time. His brother –\nYonatan, or Yoni – was 25. He had led a company of paratroopers in the 1967\nwar, before going off to university. He’d taken a bullet in the elbow while\nhelping to rescue one of his soldiers behind Syrian lines on the Golan. “He\nwants to return to the army, and he’s exactly the kind of officer you want,” Bibi\nsaid.\nI brought Yoni in for a chat. Over the next several years, I would get to know\nhim much better, becoming not just friends but neighbors, when he bought a flat\na few floors up from ours. But even in this first meeting, I found him a contrast\nto his younger brother. Bibi was practical, detail-oriented. Yoni was a more\ncomplex character. He was interested in history, and philosophy. He wrote\npoetry. He would sometimes feel the need to get off by himself, and just think.\nHe was a man of action, too. Taller and trimmer than Bibi, with a thick thatch of\ndark hair swept back from a craggy face, he was the Central Casting image of a\nsoldier. He also had real, battlefield experience. Not only did I invite him to join\nSayeret Matkal. I put him in charge of our training teams. When Danny Yatom\nleft the following year to train as an armored officer, I made Yoni my deputy.\nHowever different in some ways, the Netanyahu brothers were close. They\nseemed almost driven, to excel and to succeed. As I got to know them both, I\nsensed that the drive did not come merely from within. It came from their\nupbringing, their family background, and in particular their father. Ben-Zion\nMiliekowsky, as he then was, studied at Hebrew University at the same time as\nmy father, in the early 1930s, and was an impassioned supporter of Ben-\nGurion’s main right-wing Zionist rival, Ze’ev Jabotinsky. My father\nremembered him gathering bemused groups of students during breaks from\nclasses, standing on an upturned wooden box, and proclaiming that the Arabs\nwould never willingly accept a Jewish state. Long before the 1948 war, and\n113\nnearly four decades before our capture of the West Bank in 1967, he insisted\nthat we needed to create a Jewish state in all of biblical Israel: from the\nMediterranean to the Jordan River.\nIt was through Bibi and Yoni that I got to know their father. After 1948, he\nhad led a frustrating existence. A specialist in medieval Jewish history, he could\nnot find a place on the faculty at Hebrew University. He was convinced,\nperhaps with some reason, that his outspoken advocacy for Jabotinsky’s\nZionism in a country defined by Ben-Gurion’s had frozen him out. He left to\npursue his academic career in America, where both Yoni and Bibi spent much\nof their youth. He always remained bitter about what he felt were unfair,\npolitically inspired, roadblocks to his academic advancement in Jerusalem.\nThough he would eventually return to Israel, he was teaching at Cornell\nwhen his sons became officers under my command in Sayeret Matkal. So there\nwas a physical distance between father and sons. But what struck me was how\nlarge the father loomed in both of their lives. There was an almost adolescent\nadmiration, bordering on worship. I remember once remarking to Nava that it\nwas as if, despite all their physical self-confidence, Bibi and Yoni were tethered\nto their father by some mental umbilical cord. They seemed weighted down by a\nstruggle to live up to his expectations, to right the “wrongs” done to him, and\nachieve the advancement and success which the young State of Israel had\ndenied him. In a poignant postscript, decades later when Bibi first was elected\nPrime Minister, Ben-Zion was asked by a journalist for his reaction. “He would\nmake a very good Minister of Hasbarah,” he replied, a Hebrew word which\ntranslates as something between public relations and propaganda. “Or Foreign\nMinister.” But how about Prime Minister, the reporter pressed. Ben-Zion\nreplied: “Time will tell.”\n* * *\nEven as we mounted intercept operations deeper into Egypt and Syria, I\nmade sure that we trained as if we were already the broader strike force I hoped\nSayeret Matkal would become. We mapped out plans for commando operations\nagainst the new kind of security challenges the country faced. We worked in\ndetail on how we’d carry them out. We prepared rigorously to make sure we’d\nbe ready. Yet no matter how proficient we got, there was no guarantee it would\nactually happen. A bit like Avraham in the unit’s infancy, I had to deal with the\n114\nfrustration of trying to convince the generals in the kirya to give us the goahead.\nSome of them agreed Israel needed a specially trained commando force.\nBut not everyone felt Sayeret Matkal could, or should, take on that role. Rafael\n“Raful” Eitan was perhaps the most strident. He had fought with the Palmach in\n1948. He was an officer in Unit 101 and a commander of the parachutists’\nBattalion 890. He was now katzhar, in overall charge of all infantry and\nparatroop forces. He insisted that such work required a real sayeret, by which\nhe meant the paratroopers.\nYet the need for a special-forces unit was becoming increasingly hard to\nignore. By the summer of 1971, a couple of months after I became sayeret\ncommander, King Hussein’s army had defeated the insurgency of Fatah and a\npair of even more militant partners, the Democratic Front and the Popular Front\nfor the Liberation of Palestine. That meant a quieter eastern frontier. But the\nPalestinian groups rebased across our northern border in Lebanon. When\nJordanian Prime Minister Wafsi al-Tal was assassinated, it proved to be the start\nof a series of killings and terror attacks by a new group within Fatah, called\nBlack September. There was at least some potentially encouraging news from\nEgypt. When Nasser died in September 1970, he was succeeded by a less\nflamboyantly militant vice-president, Anwar Sadat. Yet in both Egypt and\nSyria, a number of our air force pilots were still being held prisoner.\nI felt an especially strong motivation to help bring the pilots home. They had\nrisked their lives for us. It seemed to me we owed them the same. One of the\nmen being held in Syria, Pini Nachmani, had a personal connection to many of\nus in the unit. He had worked with us on sayeret missions. I came up with a plan\nthat, while undeniably risky, seemed to me to have every chance of success. It\nwas to abduct a number of Syrians from an officers’ club on the western edge of\nDamascus. We would land in transport helicopters a few miles away and unload\na pair of armored cars captured in 1967. But Raful’s view prevailed. I could not\nget the approval of the kirya. I did take heart from Avraham Arnan’s support.\nHe was now Golda Meir’s counter-terrorism adviser. Also from the fact that\nChaim Bar-Lev’s successor as chief of staff was an old friend of the sayeret:\nDado Elazar, Avraham’s Palmach comrade from 1948. Yet winning over the\nremaining doubters in the kirya was obviously going to take time.\nAs so often during my years in uniform, however, Sayeret Matkal’s birth as\na special-forces unit came by force of circumstance: not in an officers’ club near\nDamascus, but a few miles away from our base, on a runway at Lod Airport.\n115\n* * *\nI was sitting down to dinner with Nava a little before seven on May 8, 1972\nwhen the phone rang. We’d just fed Michael, who was almost two, full of\nenergy, and showed no sign of wanting to go to bed. “It’s Manno,” said the\nvoice on the line. Brigadier General Emanuel “Manno” Shaked was Dado’s\nchief of operations. “A plane has been hijacked,” he said. “It’s heading for Lod.\nIt will land in about 30 minutes. They’ve got hostages. Get to the airport. Dado\nand Dayan are on their way.”\nI called Danny Yatom and told him to get whoever was at the sayeret base to\nLod as soon as possible. But most of the men were on training exercises,\nincluding one team with Yoni deep in the Negev Desert. He immediately began\ncalling them back. When I got to the airport, I found Dayan and Dado huddling\nin a room below the control tower, unfurnished except for a small table in the\ncorner. Talik was there with them. He was now head of all military operations\nin the kirya. Rechavam Ze’evi as well, the head of the central command area,\nwhich included Tel Aviv. So was Ahrahle Yariv, who had succeeded Meir Amit\nas head of military intelligence, and nodded glumly as I joined them.\nThe plane had landed. A Sabena Boeing 707 bound from Brussels to Tel\nAviv, it had been hijacked after a stopover in Vienna. All we knew at this point\nwas that the hijackers were Palestinians and that there were about a hundred\npassengers on board. Dado said that, while we figured out how to respond, we\nhad to make sure, at all costs, the plane didn’t take off again. It would\npresumably go to an Arab country, where we’d be powerless to act. Though\nonly a handful of my men had arrived, I took the only officer who had, Shai\nAgmon, and an El Al engineer to see whether we could disable the hijacked jet.\nIt was parked well off from the main terminal area. With the El Al man leading\nthe way, we approached from the rear, crouching low, hoping the hijackers\nwouldn’t spot us. The engines were still running, but at least the deafening noise\nkept anyone from hearing us as we ducked under the fuselage and the engineer\nremoved a stabilizing pin from the front wheel. It was an eerie feeling,\nenvisaging the captive crew and passengers, and the terrorists, a few feet above\nour heads but knowing we were powerless to do anything more to help.\nManno had called me not because I’d won my argument to expand the role\nof the sayeret. It was the luck of the draw. With the growing threat of terrorism,\nthe kirya had drawn up a list of installations which might be targeted. Next to\n116\neach, they’d put the name of the military unit to be called up in an emergency.\nWe’d been allocated Lod Airport, because our base was just 15 minutes away.\nStill, as I accompanied the engineer back to the control tower, I tried to work\nout in my mind whether we could plan, prepare and train quickly enough to\nmount an operation to free the plane later that night.\nMore than a dozen members of the unit had now arrived, and more were\njoining us every half-hour or so. I arranged for El Al to give us a hangar and a\n707 identical to the Sabena plane. Shai, Danny Yatom and I took two airline\ntechnicians with us for a closer look at the Boeing. We studied up on it as\nquickly as we could, beginning with the cockpit and the front door, which we\nsaw was too high to reach without a large ladder. But making our way back, we\nrealized the wings were low enough to climb on to. When, with the help of\nDanny, I clambered onto one of them, I managed to get one of the emergency\ndoors to open by banging hard on the top end with my open fist. I asked the\ntechnicians whether we could expect the Sabena doors to give way as well. Yes,\nhe said, but he cautioned me that on some airlines, there were passenger seats\nnext to at least one of the two doors above each wing.\nWalking up into the cabin, I tried to work out how we might attack the\nhijackers before they were able to harm the passengers, or us. The risks were\nobvious. But I felt we had to be ready to act. With the rest of the sayeret still\nmaking its way to Lod, I put Danny in charge of briefing the new arrivals,\nfamiliarizing them with the 707 and preparing for the possibility of an assault\noperation. I also told him to get hold of a couple of dozen small, 22-caliber,\nBeretta pistols. I couldn’t see how we’d manage to make our way onto the plane\nwith Uzis. We knew we’d have to get up to speed quickly on using the Berettas.\nNone of us had trained on them. But many of the air marshals on board El Al\nflights were Sayeret Matkal reservists, and they did use Berettas. I told Danny\nto check for any sayeret marshals arriving on El Al flights and get them to join\nus.\nAs I headed back to see Dado, we were nowhere close to a detailed plan on\nhow to confront the hijackers. Nor did we have any orders. The people who\nwould give them – Dado, Dayan and ultimately Prime Minister Meir – were still\ndeciding how to respond. But when I reached the control tower, at about\n9:30pm, the order came, if not to mount an operation, at least to make sure the\nsayeret was ready. “Talk to Talik,” Dado told me. “See what the options are to\ntake over the plane if that’s the decision.” I sat down with Talik and ran through\nwhat I’d learned from my brief look at the hijacked plane and the work we’d\n117\nbeen doing on the Israeli 707. I told him I’d need another two hours to make\nsure my men had practiced climbing up on the wings and forcing open the\ndoors, and another hour for preparations and briefings for the teams who would\nbe participating in the operation. “By about half an hour after midnight, we’ll be\nready to deploy,” I said, though from his stoic, nearly silent response I couldn’t\nbe sure whether he was in favor of an assault. “By 0100, we’ll be ready to act.”\nBoth of us went back to see Dado. He seemed encouraged, especially when I\nsaid we’d be ready to move by one in the morning. He told me the pilot of the\nplane had been in contact with the control tower. He was an RAF veteran and,\nthough the terrorists seemed unaware of this, he was also Jewish. The hijackers\nwere demanding more than 300 Arab prisoners be released and flown to Cairo.\n“And they seem quite nervous.”\nReturning to the hangar, I sent Shai Agmon with four soldiers to set up a\nlookout and sniper post about 70 yards to the side of the Sabena jet. I told him\nnot to open fire unless they were sure there had been shooting inside the plane\nand could positively identify an armed hijacker. By now, we had three dozen\nsoldiers and officers, including Uzi Dayan and his full team. I took all those\nwho were already briefed and divided them into four groups, each with an\nofficer and five soldiers and assigned to deal with one of the wing doors. I left\nthe others to continue training.\nWhen midnight came, I was far from certain we could meet the 12:30 am\ndeployment target I’d given Talik. Incoming flights had stopped for the night,\nand we still hadn’t managed to bring in any air marshals. I believed they would\ngive us a crucial advantage. They knew Berettas. They also knew the inside of a\n707. But I was worried about losing Dado’s trust in a sayeret operation if we\nfailed to meet the timeline. From Shai’s lookout post to the side of the plane, I\nlearned that the front cabin door of the plane was open. He said he’d seen a\ncouple of hijackers walking by it, silhouetted by the dim cabin light. But\notherwise, there was no sign of activity inside. I called Talik and told him I was\ntaking my assault teams to the area behind the plane. About a half-hour later, I\nconfirmed we were ready to begin the operation. Although the plane’s engines\nwere off now, our approach had been masked by the drone of the generator\nbrought in to supply power to the cabin. We were lying face-down on the\ntarmac, directly behind the tail of the plane but well back. Two rows of 12 men,\nplus me and a soldier in charge of the communications. We’d brought along\nfour small ladders to help us onto the wings. “We want to exploit the darkness,\nand the sound of the generator, to cover us,” I said in my final briefing before\n118\nwe’d left the hangar. “If they realize we’re there, we get into the cabin as\nquickly as possible, any way we can. The first five seconds will ne critical. Act\ndecisively,” I told the men. “Assume that everyone else will be doing the same.\nTrust your instincts. You are trained for this.”\nBut more than an hour passed as we waited for the green light to storm the\nplane. My main concern wasn’t that the hijackers would see us. There seemed\nlittle reason to believe one of them would suddenly decide to take a walk in the\nmiddle of the night. But sunrise was around five in the morning, and there was\nno way I could see mounting our assault in broad daylight. If we didn’t get the\ngo-ahead soon, the chance would be lost. I called Talik several times, making\nthe point that if we were going to do it, we needed to use darkness as an ally.\nThe sayeret was a breed of night animals. Other people, even terrorists, would\nbe less alert and effective at night. But he kept saying he needed more time.\nFinally, an hour before sunrise, he called back. “The big boss is on his way,”\nhe said. I left the others and crept back to meet the Defense Minister, a good\neighty yards from the plane. Dayan greeted me with a whispered hello. In a\nway, his arrival reminded me of my first operation in the sayeret when, before\nheading north to the Golan, I’d been summoned to brief Tzvi Tzur, the chief of\nstaff. Tzur had seemed less interested in the details than in confirming that I was\nconfident the mission would work. Dayan, of course, had as much operational\nknowledge and experience as anyone in Israel. Yet it seemed to me that he, too,\nwanted to satisfy himself that I honestly felt we were in a position to succeed.\nEspecially, though he never so much as hinted at this, because two of the\nofficers I would be taking in with me, Uzi and Mookie Betzer, were members of\nhis family.\n“How do you plan to do it?” he asked. I explained how we would get into the\nplane simultaneously, in four teams, and confront the hijackers. I said I was\nconfident we’d succeed, especially since darkness gave us an element of\nsurprise, and the terrorists were bound to be tiring. “We can do it,” I said.\n“Better now than in daytime.” Dayan merely nodded. He stood there, silent, for\nanother few moments. “I’ll let you know,” he said, then shook my hand and\nreturned to the control tower. But fifteen minutes later he sent his reply, via\nTalik. It was brief and explicit: “Not tonight.”\nFor the first but not the last time in uniform, I felt the frustration of finding\nmy preparation and judgement trumped, without explanation, by a decision\nfrom above. When I got back to the control tower, I made no attempt to hide my\nview we should have moved against the hijackers while we had the chance. But\n119\nDado sat me down and filled me in on what was obviously a changing situation.\nHe said the terrorists had allowed the pilot, Reginald Levy, to come see Dayan\nand press their demands. He had brought with him a slab of light-yellow\nmaterial to demonstrate the seriousness of the risk of saying no. When tested, it\nturned out to be exactly what the hijackers said it was: plastic explosive.\nThe pilot said there were four terrorists: two men with pistols and two\nwomen with explosives and grenades. There were 95 passengers and seven\ncrew. He’d also confirmed that none of the exits above the wings was blocked\nby a passenger seat. He’d returned to the plane without any clear answer from\nDayan on the prisoner release. But before leaving, he revealed that his own wife\nwas among the passengers. He asked Dayan to promise that Israel would help\ncare for their daughter if the hijack ended tragically.\nBy the next morning, that was looking more and more likely. Though the\nhijackers were still in contact with the tower, the only visible movement was the\narrival of a representative of the Red Cross. The lead hijacker, who called\nhimself Captain Rifa’at, was making increasingly forceful demands for the\nprisoner release. Our negotiating team did its best to buy time by giving the\nappearance we were considering the demand. It was Dayan who came up with\nthe idea of going further. He told Rechavam Ze’evi, as the head of the central\ncommand area, to begin rounding up hundreds of young Israeli reserve soldiers.\nHe wanted them dressed them in prison uniforms, and then bused to the airport,\nwithin sight of the hijacked jet. Dayan also arranged for another Boeing 707,\nostensibly to take the “freed prisoners” on to Cairo.\n“What then?” Ze’evi asked Dayan. “We’re not really going to put them on a\nplane and take off!”\nIt was after he’d had no real reply that he in effect answered his own\nquestion, inadvertently leading us to the idea of attempting a daytime attack\nafter all. Talking to Dado and me, he said: “Since we’re going to such lengths to\ndeceive them, why not just add another layer? Why can’t Ehud’s people take the\nrole of the airport mechanics?” Looking at each other, Dado and I realized it\nwas a stroke of brilliance. Dado went to share the plan with Dayan, confident\nthat he would be no less enthusiastic, which he was. I remained with Ze’evi and\nhis deputy to work out the details. We agreed they would take care of the\npantomime with the prisoners, as well arranging for El Al to get us the ladder\ntrucks that airline maintenance crews used, which would allow us access to the\nSabena jet’s front and rear doors as well. That left me free to concentrate on\npreparation and training.\n120\nWe had just a few hours to adapt the original plan. Although we’d trained in\nclose-quarters fighting for my plan to attack the officers’ club near Damascus,\nwe’d never had to use that skill in a live mission. Nor had we ever used the\nBerettas. While we’d disguised ourselves as enemy soldiers or military police\non our intelligence operations, this would be the first time we were taking on\nthe persona of civilian engineers, with the need to fool armed terrorists on the\nlookout for any sign of danger or betrayal. And for the first time in any of our\nmajor operations, we would be operating in daytime.\nNow that nearly all our soldiers and officers had arrived, I began arranging\nthe final line-up of attack teams. We would need six rather than four, since the\nnew plan would give us access to the front and rear doors. Danny now also told\nme that a couple of the El Al technicians had shown him a way of climbing up\nfrom inside the nose wheel into the cockpit. One of the toughest and strongest\nof our soldiers, Uri Koren, had tried it successfully on the El Al 707. I told\nDanny, Uri and another officer that they would be assigned to attack through the\nfront door and the nose wheel. I put Uzi Dayan in charge of the tail door. The\nemergency doors above the wings, however, still gave us the quickest way in. I\nplanned to command the operation from the left of the aircraft, because both the\nfront and tail doors also faced that way. I entrusted Bibi Netanyahu and his team\nwith breaking in through the main wing door on the far side of the plane.\nBy noon, we got a further boost. With the resumption of incoming flights,\nwe began collecting air marshals. One in particular raised my confidence. I\nknew Mordechai Rachamim well from the sayeret. He was a Yemeni Jew from\nElyakhin, the moshav near Mishmar Hasharon where Baddura and the other\nYemeni workers lived. He was tall, strong and athletic, naturally agile and quick\nto respond in situations of danger. He was also no ordinary air marshal. In 1969,\nhe’d been posted on an El Al flight from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv. On a stopover\nin Zurich, four gunmen from Fatah’s main radical rival in the PLO, the Popular\nFront for the Liberation of Palestine, leapt out of a car, opened fire with AK-47s\nand began throwing grenades. The PFLP assault injured four of the crew and\nkilled the co-pilot. Armed with his Beretta, Mordechai rushed to the cockpit\nwindow and returned fire. Seeing the attackers were too far away, he slid down\nthe emergency chute. Once on the tarmac, he shot one of the terrorists in the\nhead and kept the rest of them at bay.\nAs additional air marshals arrived, I slotted each of them into an assault team\nin place of one of our sayeret soldiers. The next to arrive was Marco Ashkenazi,\na Cairo-born veteran with whom I’d worked on a mission inside Egypt. I put\n121\nMordechai on the main left-side wing door, critical for the opening moments of\nthe assault, and added Marco to Bibi’s team on the other side of the aircraft.\nIt was then that Yoni arrived back from Negev. He insisted on being added\nto one of the assault teams. In one respect, that made sense. He had more\nbattlefield experience than almost everyone in the unit. But there was an\nunwritten sayeret rule never to place two brothers together in the line of fire.\n“It’s too late,” I told him, with an arm on his shoulder. “Bibi has already been\ntraining his team.” He went off to find Bibi. I thought there was little chance of\nBibi standing down, but didn’t feel I could stop Yoni from trying. Five minutes\nlater, they came to talk to me. Bibi said: “Yoni wants to replace me. We want\nyou to decide.” I assumed both of them knew what I’d say. “Today, it’s Bibi,” I\nreplied. “But Yoni, this is not our last operation. I will make sure you are there\nthe next time.”\nThe last marshal to join us was a tall, thin redhead we always called Zur.\nHe’d had only 15 minutes to begin training when I got word that Dado – along\nwith Ze’evi and Ahrahle Yariv – were on their way to see a run-through. As\nthey filed into the hangar, I quickly explained the operational plan. I showed\nthem how we would push in the wing doors in, and then ushered them inside the\n707. Two minutes later, the emergency-door teams climbed on to the wings.\nWhen I gave the agreed two-finger whistle, they stormed the plane. “OK,\ngentlemen,” Dado told the team leaders when it was over. “We’ve seen what we\nneeded.” Before returning to the control tower, however, he took me aside.\n“You know they have explosives, right?” he said. When I said yes, his tone\nsoftened. “You don’t have much time, Ehud” he said. “Don’t waste it.\nBeHatzlakha.” Good luck.\nWe still had to outfit ourselves in mechanics’ overalls, and swap the\nsayeret’s paratroop-style red boots for black ones. I directed all the men to\nconceal the Berettas on a waist-belt inside their overalls. We got acquainted\nwith our mechanics’ toolboxes. Finally we organized our maintenance\nmotorcade: four electronic buggies in front, towing four ladders, two short ones\nfor the wings and taller ones for the front and rear doors. Waiting for the order\nto move, I said a final few words. Seeing the determination and nervous\nanticipation on the faces of the men around me, I began by reiterating that the\nfirst five seconds would be critical. “We all know that nothing ever happens\nexactly according to plan. Each and every one of us has to focus on speed,\nmomentum and precision. No one can wait for anyone else to act. From the\nmoment I give the signal, or if we come under fire, each team has to act as if\n122\nthey have to accomplish this all on their own. All of us must assume that. Keep\ncool. Stay focused. Rely on your instincts. We’re ready for this mission. And\nwe are going to achieve it.”\nOne minute after four in the afternoon, we got the word to go. I was in the\nlead buggy, consciously trying to look like a civilian, not a soldier. It was about\na mile-and-a-half to the aircraft. I glanced back at the others. Like me, many of\nthem had been awake for 30 hours or more, in some cases nearly 48 hours. The\nair marshals had been plucked off long-haul flights on which relaxation, much\nless sleep, was not an option. As before any mission, I knew everyone would be\nthinking about what was about to happen. They also realized that if we failed,\nthe passengers trapped inside the plane would be at the mercy of terrorists\narmed with AK-47s and explosives. But I was confident that any apprehension\nwould be overtaken by adrenalin when as the assault began.\nAs we got closer, Shai Agmon radioed me. He said two or three people, not\nthe terrorists, had come out of the plane. One seemed to be the Red Cross man.\nThey were about 120 yards away from the aircraft. As soon as he’d signed off, I\ngot word from the command post in the control tower that it was indeed the Red\nCross representative, along with two of the flight crew. They’d been chosen by\nthe terrorists to do security checks on the “maintenance” men.\nI brought the convoy to a halt. The Red Cross man gave each of us a fairly\ncursory body search before waving us on. Then, he got to Bibi. Though I had\nsomehow failed to notice, he had left on his red sayeret boots. In Israel, that was\nthe equivalent of a neon sign saying: “I am a paratrooper.” Although the Red\nCross man noticed the boots, he at first made no comment. Then, rolling up the\npants leg of Bibi’s overalls, he saw his Beretta – not inside his waistbelt, but\ninside the boot. The next thing I heard was an angry spurt of French as the man\ncalled the control tower. For a moment, I feared the mission was over, with\npotentially fatal repercussions for the hostages. But whatever explanation the\nRed Cross man was given – presumably by Dayan himself, who would not have\nheld back in conveying what was at stake – it dissuaded him from taking further\naction.\nAs we were returning to the buggies, the Red Cross man told me that\n“Captain Rifa’at” had ordered us to pull up to the generator on the side of the\nplane. Each of us would then have to walk forward and open the front of our\noveralls so he could make sure we weren’t armed. I passed back four orders to\nthe rest of the men. First, with no exceptions, move your pistol to the back of\nyour belt. Second: I’ll be the first to go through the inspection. Third: watch\n123\nwhat I do and do the same. Finally, if our cover is broken, or if you hear\ngunfire, we all storm the plane.\nI felt as I always did as an operation was about to begin. Along with the\ntension, I had a keen awareness of everything happening around me, almost as\nif I was watching things in slow motion, in high resolution. When our\nmotorcade approached the generator, Rifa’at leaned out from the co-pilot’s\nwindow. He was pointing a pistol at us. He seemed to be in his late 20s or early\n30s. He had dark hair and a moustache and the hint of a stubbly beard. We\nstopped beside the generator. I got out and walked toward the cockpit, halting\nabout 10 feet away. Looking up the hijacker, I made a conscious effort to appear\ncurious rather than worried. His eyes seemed a mix of intense focus and tension.\nI opened the front of my overalls. Because of the heat, I was wearing nothing\nelse on top. He nodded his head to signal he was satisfied. I refastened the\noveralls and moved off. One by one, the other men passed inspection. Then we\nwent back and brought the two smaller ladders to the side of each wing, and the\n“mechanics” set down to work. I delayed bringing in the large ladders so as to\nminimize any risk of arousing the terrorists’ suspicions.\nThe fact that at least so far they seemed to suspect nothing was in large part\ndown to Dayan’s misdirection plan. As we began working on the plane, the\n“Palestinian” prisoners were disembarking from buses about 300 yards away.\nAs Rifa’at watched, several hundred men formed long rows. A few of them\nwaved in his direction. The Boeing which was theoretically going to take them\non to Cairo, to be followed by the Sabena jet minus the hostages, was being\ntowed into position.\nOne by one, our assault teams were moving into place. All that remained\nwas for me to give a short, sharp whistle and the attack would begin. Yet just as\nI was raising my fingers to my mouth, I saw Bibi coming toward me from under\nthe fuselage. He motioned to me to wait. Zur, the last of our air marshals, had a\nproblem. Having spent 10 hours in the air on the way back to Israel, before\nbeing immediately plugged into an assault team, he had something to attend to.\n“He has to take a shit,” Bibi said. Can’t it wait, I asked. No, was the answer. So\nI said OK, leading to the most surreal “operational” moment I would witness\nduring all my years in the military.\nThe “prisoner release” was now in full flow. Dozens of military vehicles,\nand a small army of fire engines and ambulances, had also pulled to the far end\nof the runway, out of sight of the hijackers, in case our attack on the Sabena jet\nwent wrong. Tel Aviv hospitals were on alert. And Zur was crouching and\n124\nrelieving himself. He nodded in gratitude when he’d finished, and returned to\nBibi’s team on the far wing. I gave him a full minute to be certain he was in\nplace.\nThen I whistled. From my initial position beside the plane, I saw Danny\nYatom and his team begin to move one of the tall ladders toward the front door.\nShifting my eyes toward the wing doors as the “crucial first five seconds” ticked\nby, I saw both the ones on my side of the plane were still shut. I climbed up on\nthe wing. When I got to the smaller, rear door I saw the main one cave inward\nand Mordechai Rachamim rush in. But the soldier on the other door was\ntrembling and frozen in place. I slapped him, hard, on the back. “Move!” I\nshouted. Instantly, he pushed the door in and rushed inside. I then noticed Uzi\nand his team had still not entered from the rear. I jumped from the wing and ran\ntoward the ladder at the back, but by the time I got there, they had made it\ninside, and I followed them in.\nEverything was over within 90 seconds. As I’d expected, the planning and\ntraining turned out to matter less than instinct and initiative. Within seconds, Uri\nKoren managed to get into the nose-wheel assembly. Though he couldn’t\ndislodge a metal-mesh panel separating it from the cockpit, he spotted the\noutline of a man’s foot above him, fired, and wounded Captain Rifa’at. The\nother members of Danny’s team in front were less lucky. With the ladder, they\nhad no trouble getting to the passenger door, but they struggled to force it open.\nWhen they did nudge it open a crack, one of the hijackers opened fire, slightly\nwounding one of the men and forcing them to abandon the attempt.\nMordechai went in shooting, but immediately drew fire and had to retreat.\nBut Omer Wachman, another air marshal I’d posted on the far wing, was in a\ncouple of seconds later. Coming face-to-face with one of the hijackers, he shot\nhim in the head. That allowed Mordechai to get back inside. He quickly\nexchanged fire with the hobbled Captain Rifa’at, hitting the hijacker in the side.\nAs Mordechai ducked down to reload his pistol, Rifa’at managed to lock\nhimself inside one of the toilets near the cockpit. Mordechai ran after him. He\nfired through the bathroom door, then kicked it open and confirmed that he was\ndead. Rushing back toward the center of plane, he spotted the main woman\nhijacker, wearing a bulky explosive vest. Grabbing her hands, he reached inside\nthe vest and yanked out the battery pack. With two of the hijackers already\ndead, Mordechai had now subdued the third. But knowing that there was still\nanother woman unaccounted for, he handed her over to Bibi and Marco\nAshkenazi. Bibi grabbed her by the back of her hair, but it turned out to be a\n125\nwig, which came off in his hand. As she began screaming, Marco instinctively\nstruck her across the face, but he used the hand in which he had his Beretta. The\ngun went off, and the bullet grazed Bibi in his upper arm.\nWhen Uzi Dayan had finally got in through the rear door, he’d run up\nagainst a stocky, suntanned man blocking in his way, and fired – thankfully,\nonly into his midsection. He turned out to be one of the passengers, a filmmaker\nfrom Austria. Still, there was the other woman hijacker to deal with.\nSeveral of the passengers pointed to the floor just ahead of Uzi, where she lay\ncurled up, holding a grenade with the pin out. Ordering her loudly, sternly, not\nto move, Uzi wrapped his hand over hers, extracted the grenade from her grasp\nfinger by finger, replaced the pin, and had one of his men lead her out of the\nplane and down the stairs.\nAll the hijackers had been either killed or captured.\nTragically, in the initial crossfire, a 22-year-old passenger named Miriam\nHoltzberg, had been hit. Although the man whom Uzi had mistakenly shot\nrecovered, she did not. Yet all of the remaining passengers and crew were now\nfree and safe, alive and unharmed.\nI felt a mix of emotions when it was over: pride, a sense of achievement\nagainst all the odds. And huge relief at having succeeded in ending the ordeal of\nthe captives. Without my saying so, everyone in the unit understood that my\ninaugural comments as commander, about our need to become a full specialforces\nunit, were no longer a distant wish. Still, I knew this was only one step,\nand I wanted to make sure we kept our feet on the ground. The day after the\nSabena rescue, Israeli newspapers devoted acres of newsprint to how the\noperation had succeeded. Since Sayeret Matkal’s existence was still an official\nsecret, the headline writers called us, variously, a “special” unit, a “select” unit\nand even in one case, because of our El Al coveralls, “angels in white.” We did,\nbriefly, celebrate back at the sayeret base. But as with every other operation, we\nwent through a self-critical assessment of what we could have done better. How,\nif we had to do another hostage-rescue operation, could we make sure none of\nthe passengers was harmed? How could we improve co-ordination among the\nassault teams? And minimize the risk of shooting each other. Why had I, as\ncommander of the operation, had to wait for someone else to suggest the idea of\ndisguising ourselves as aircraft technicians? And why had we failed to train\nwith Berettas and other pistols as well as Uzis?\n126\nThey were not just academic issues. Even if we were never again called upon\nto free a hijacked airplane, I assumed we would face other operations which\nwere equally urgent, without the weeks or even months of preparation we’d\nalways insisted on in the past.\n* * *\nAfter the Sabena operation, I emphasized the need for us to be proactive. It\nwouldn’t be up to us to decide which operations to do. But it was up to us to\ntake the initiative in identifying and understanding specific threats and framing\nways in which we could provide a response. Even before Sabena, barely two\nweeks had gone by when I didn’t go to Eli Zeira, who was in charge of the\noperations department of military intelligence, with a mission which I felt\nconfident we were ready to carry out. Several of the most complex centered on\nthe new threat posed by Palestinian groups in Lebanon. Before the civil war in\nJordan, King Hussein had accused Fatah, the PFLP and the equally militant\nDemocratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine of trying to create “a state\nwithin a state” and deliberately weakening his government. Now, they were\ndoing much the same in Lebanon. Their headquarters buildings in southern\nBeirut were spawning hijackings or terror attacks. From bases in southern\nLebanon, the Palestinians were also firing Katyusha rockets into Israel.\nOne of the operations I planned targeted Arafat. From our intelligence\nintercepts, we knew that a day or two after a particularly intense clash with\nIsraeli artillery units on the Lebanese border, he would tour the area and meet\nwith his commanders. If we were going to go after him, however, we needed to\nknow exactly when he was coming. Fortunately, the Lebanese authorities\ntracked Arafat’s motorcade on these “review the troops” excursions, reporting\nhow many cars were involved, which one he was in, and their progress. Thanks\nto previous sayeret missions, we could listen in. In order to ensure the operation\nwould be on our terms, I proposed that a couple of days before we planned to\nmove, Israeli artillery target a Fatah rocket site in an isolated area about ten\nmiles from the border, where there was just a single road in from Beirut. I\nproposed landing several teams by helicopter the night before. We would lie in\nwait until the Lebanese army checkpoints reported that the Fatah convoy was on\nits way. Israeli helicopters and F-4 jets would then cut off the road on both\nsides, and we would ambush Arafat’s vehicle.\n127\nWhen I took the plan to Eli Zeira, he was reading an issue of the French\nnewsmagazine l’Express and snacking on salted almonds from a dish on his\ndesk. As I ran through the reason we’d come up with the plan – the bourgeoning\npower of Arafat and Fatah in Lebanon – he peered at me over his reading\nglasses and nodded. As I set out the details of the attack plan, he listened, with\nno obvious sign of approval or rejection. But after I’d finished, he dismissed it\nout of hand. He said that Arafat was no longer the battlefield commander whose\nforces had fought Israel in Karameh. “He’s fat. He’s political,” he said. “He is\nnot a target for this kind of operation.”\nAfter the Sabena hostage-rescue, Dado and the other senior officers in the\nkirya did seem more receptive to our trying to initiate operations, especially the\nplan to seize Syrian officers and trade them for the Israeli pilots. But such a\nmission required not just military or intelligence approval. Dayan, and possibly\nGolda as well, would have to sign off, and there was little immediate sign of\nthat. But, once again, events on the ground would force the issue. Early on the\nmorning of June 9, our intelligence intercepts gave us notice that the next day, a\ngroup of senior Syrian officers was going to make an inspection visit to the\neastern part of the Lebanese border area with Israel. We would have to move\nquickly. Within the space of 12 hours, we’d need to plan the attack, organize,\nequip and brief the assault teams, make the three-and-a-half-hour drive north,\nand cross into Lebanon.\nStill, I was determined to try, which marked the start of two of my most\nfrustrating weeks as Sayeret Matkal commander. The place where we planned\nto abduct the Syrians was an area I knew personally: the sparsely settled strip of\nland where Lebanon, Syria and Israel met, not far from where I’d helped\n“capture” several Syrian villages on the final day of the 1967 war. With the\nconvoy expected to pass through the next morning, we crossed the border a little\nbefore midnight on June 9. We lay in ambush in dense vegetation a few meters\noff a curve in the road, further reducing the time the Syrians would have to react\nonce they saw us. I stationed two other sayeret teams a few hundred yards away\nin either direction, so they could cut off the road once we attacked.\nBut as the convoy was approaching, I was suddenly contacted by the sayeret\nofficer we’d stationed in the command post back in Israel. He relayed a message\nfrom Motta Gur, the head of the northern command. Its intelligence unit said\nthere was a Lebanese Army checkpoint a quarter-mile from the ambush site.\nMotta himself was in the south, with Dado, watching a tank exercise. So I\nhad no way of talking to him. I replied through the officer in the command post.\n128\n“Tell Motta we know about it,” I said. “We’ve planned for it. It’s not a\nproblem.” I figured there were at most four or five Lebanese soldiers manning\nthe checkpoint. The last thing they’d want to do is get involved in a firefight\nbetween us and the Syrians. But Motta’s reply was unequivocal. The mission\nwas off.\nWhen we’d climbed through a bramble-filled ravine back into Israel, I left a\nmessage for Motta. I found it hard to disguise my frustration, and my anger, at\nbeing ordered to abort the attack, especially after my assurances that the\nLebanese roadblock was not a problem. Yet when we got back to the sayeret\nbase, I realized there was more to his veto than I’d thought. He and Dado had\nreceived intelligence saying the Syrians were likely to make a series of further\ninspection tours of the border area, so this would not be our last chance. The\nnext day, we received word they’d be touring the western part of the border on\nJune 13. On the Lebanese side, it was known as Ras Naqoura, on ours as Rosh\nHanirkra, where the Mediterranean coastline rose dramatically to a ridge and,\nonce into Israel, sloped steeply down again toward Haifa.\nI took in two main assault teams, one led by Mookie, the other by Uzi\nDayan. We hid in a tangle of bushes about halfway along the road which\nclimbed up toward the border ridge. I stationed Bibi and his team at the bottom\nof the road, equipped with Uzis and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. We\nwaited, knowing that we’d be able to see the convoy as it twisted its way up\ntoward us. Again, I had no direct link to Motta. Yet both he and Dado were\nfollowing the mission from a command post in northern Israel. We were in\nnearly real-time contact through a sayeret officer, named Amit Ben-Horn, right\nacross the border.\nA first vehicle appeared at around 10:30 in the morning. Bibi radioed us. It\nwas a Lebanese army armored car with a single machine-gun. It drove past and\nhalted 150 feet on, at the point where the road began to climb. The two guys\ninside took out a small table and a couple of chairs and began brewing up coffee\non the side of the road. “All OK,” I said when I radioed Amit to tell him. “Predeployment.”\nThe convoy arrived two hours later and began to climb. “We’re\ntaking it,” I radioed Amit.\n“Wait,” he replied. And as I kept pressing him for the final go-ahead, another\n30 seconds passed.\n“Not approved,” he finally barked back at me, clearly wanting to make sure I\ngot the message.\n129\n“What the hell is going on?” I replied, in a mix of a shout and a whisper,\nsince I knew the convoy was getting closer. But within a minute, we spotted the\nlead Land Rover, which was soon past us on the way up to the ridge. It was\nfollowed by two large American cars, with the Syrian officers, and then a\ntrailing security vehicle. It was too late. I was fuming. The convoy had passed\nwithin a couple of yards of us, moving slowly because of the incline. But,\nregaining my composure, I realized we’d get another opportunity, when the\nofficers returned from their inspection visit. We now knew exactly how the\nconvoy was deployed, and with any luck, the security men would be less alert\nby the end of the day. Even better, it would be beginning to get dark, perfect\nconditions for the ambush.\nBut as we were waiting, Amit radioed me with a question from from Dado\nand Motta. “Where’s the armored car?” It’s still there, at the bottom of the road,\nI told them. “But there’s nothing it can do.” Bibi and his team had it in their\nsights. I considered not telling Amit what happened a few minutes later: a\nLebanese shepherd, with a half-dozen sheep, stumbled on us. One of Uzi’s men,\nfluent in Arabic, tied the startled man’s arms behind his back, scattered the\nsheep, and told him: “It’s fine. Another hour or so, we’ll be gone, and we’ll let\nyou go.” It turned out to be less than an hour. Forty-five minutes. During which,\nnot once but twice, Amit told us that Dado and Motta were worried: about the\narmored car and now about the shepherd. I assured him everything was fine.\nWe’d do the operation. The guys in the armored car would be helpless. If all\nwent well, they might not even know we’d intercepted the convoy. The\nshepherd, like us, was just waiting for it to be over so we could all go home.\nMinutes later, Amit called again. He told us the convoy was on its way down.\nBut barely 60 seconds later, he said: “It’s off. Don’t do it. Dado told me to\nrepeat it twice so you’d understand: do not do the operation.”\nWhen we got back to the command post, not only were Dado and Motta\nthere. Since Motta was within days of leaving to become Israel’s military\nattaché in Washington, they’d been joined by his successor as head of the\nnorthern command, Yitzhak Hofi. Three times, I suggested to Dado that we\nspeak without my officers present. I did not feel it was right to have Uzi,\nMookie and Bibi hear me the generals how I felt. But Dado insisted there was\nno reason for them to leave.\n“This is a serious issue,” I said, trying to keep my emotions in check. “What\nhappened out there is unacceptable. An effective special-forces unit cannot\noperate this way. For the second time in a week, you’ve made us stop an\n130\noperation. Both times, it was an operation that we, the ones who have to do it,\nknew could succeed. An operation on which the fate of three Israeli pilots\ndepends. One of whom we know personally, and have worked with. Now, again,\nwith no real reason, you’ve stopped us. I see this as a breach of trust.” When\nneither Dado nor Motta replied, I went on: “I have to tell you openly. You can’t\npossibly judge the situation on the ground. Only we can. And you’re behaving\nas if you know. You can’t know from here. There was no reason for us not to\ngrab those officers. I don’t want to reach a point when I have to start thinking\nabout what to report back, or not report, just to make sure we’re free to\ncomplete a mission that you ordered, after agreeing it was necessary for Israel.”\nNo one said anything for a few moments. I could see that Uzi, Mookie and\nBibi were shocked at having heard me speak in this way to three of the top\ncommanders of the armed forces. But I meant every word. If Sayeret Matkal\nwas to function as a special-forces unit, it needed to have the trust of those\nwho’d authorized an operation in the first place. It was Dado who finally\nreplied. Sort of. Trying to defuse the tension, he told us a joke from his Palmach\ndays. “There are two bulls who come into a field full of cows. A young one and\nold one. The young one says to the old guy: let’s run over there to the far end of\nthe field, where the prettiest cow is, and we can fuck her. The old bull replies:\n“No need to rush. Let’s go slowly, and fuck them all.”\nI guess we were meant to be the young bulls.\nI doubt Dado knew whether we’d get a third chance at the Syrian officers,\nthough I’m sure he hoped so. A week later, we got word there would be a final\ninspection visit, to the central sector of the border area. Ordinarily, I would have\nled the operation. Now, I made an exception. To Dado’s obvious surprise, I\ndecided to remain behind, in the command post. “A commander has to be in the\nbest place to ensure a mission is successfully completed,” I told him. “I’ve\ncome to the conclusion the only way I can do that is to be here with you.\nBecause the real bottleneck isn’t out there in the field. It’s here.”\nI placed Yoni, who had just become my deputy, in overall command of the\ntwo main teams: Uzi Dayan’s and another led by one of our most impressive\nyoung officers, a kibbutznik named Danny Brunner. He reminded me a lot of\nNechemia Cohen: he spoke little, and softly, but once an operation began was\ncalm, clear minded and able to anticipate and avoid trouble before it\nmaterialized. Two other teams, one led by Mookie Betzer and the other by Shai\nAgmon, would act as blocking units, concealed half-a-mile on either side, once\nthe main force intercepted the convoy. We chose a spot across from the Israeli\n131\nmoshav of Za’arit. We equipped Yoni’s force with a pair of Land Rovers in\nLebanese army colors and had them hide overnight in the moshav’s orchards, a\nhundred yards from the road on the Lebanese side of the frontier. The next\nmorning, when we got confirmation the convoy was on its way, they crossed\nand stationed themselves on the road, lifted the hood of one of the vehicles and\nmade as if they were trying to repair engine trouble. Both the blocking forces\nwere in half-tracks with heavy machine-guns in case the convoy chose to stand\nand fight.\nWhat we didn’t count on was a Lebanese driver, in a VW Beetle as I recall,\nputtering along the road shortly after Yoni’s team crossed. The man waved at\nthem. Quite rightly, Yoni let him drive on. Along with the other obvious reasons\nnot to fire on a civilian VW, he didn’t want to alert the Syrians and their hosts\nthere was danger ahead. But the Lebanese motorist, as well as a group of nearby\nfarmers, were suspicious enough to deliver a warning that there were a couple\nof stalled Land Rovers on the side of the road. The convoy halted shortly after\npassing Mookie’s force, hidden in a field a few dozen yards away.\nHad I not been in the command post, I’m pretty sure what would have\nhappened next. The mission would have been called off. This time, I was the\none in direct contact with all three teams. Even before I gave the order, Yoni\nhad anticipated it. He and Uzi turned west to confront the convoy. In a brief\ninitial exchange of gunfire, one of Uzi’s men was wounded, not seriously, in the\nleg. But with Mookie’s team firing from behind and Yoni’s and Uzi’s men in\nfront, the convoy was trapped, and the Syrians captured.\nThe safest way back into Israel would have been the way the force had\nentered. But Yoni and Uzi realized the main imperative was to get the Syrians\nout as quickly as possible. At a not-inconsiderable cost to a pair of American\nlimousines, Uzi drove each of them, with a total of five Syrian officers, through\na boulder-strewn field across the border.\nThe Syrians included three senior members of the Operations Department of\nthe General Staff, and two from Air Force intelligence. Israel made an\nimmediate offer to swap them for our pilots, though how enthusiastically I’m\nnot sure. With this kind of leverage on our side, it seemed unlikely the Syrians\nwould do further harm to our pilots. Our intelligence officers were keen to get\nevery bit of information they could before sending the Syrians home. It would\nbe a year later before the exchange was done. Yoni received a well-deserved\ntzalash for his role in the mission.\n132\n* * *\nBarely two months after the ambush operation in south Lebanon, Black\nSeptember seized and murdered members of the Israeli team at the 1972\nOlympics in Munich.\nAs soon as the news broke on the morning of September 5, I phoned Ahrahle\nYariv as head of military intelligence. “You need to send us,” I said. I tried to\npersuade him that if it came down to an operation to free our hostages, Sayeret\nMatkal offered the best hope that it would not end in a bloodbath. We had the\nmind-set, the background, the training and now the experience. I also knew the\nGerman military had no special-forces unit. I’d have been even more worried if\nI had known that German law barred the army from operating in peacetime.\nThat meant any use of force would be left to the police. Ahrahle told me it was\ntoo early to say what involvement, if any, Israel might have. He’d get back in\ntouch with a decision when it came.\nI called my officers together to begin planning. I decided to use the men who\nhad been with me for the Sabena mission, including Mordechai Rachamim. We\ncollated information from the stream of media reports from Munich and\nassembled a rough idea of the layout of the building the terrorists had attacked.\nAs for the attackers, I said we had to assume there were at least half-a-dozen,\nthat they had not just AK-47s but grenades or other explosives. And that like the\nSabena hijackers, they would be prepared to die but hoping to live. All of that\nturned out to be true. None of it, however, could alter the reply I got from\nAhrahle a couple of hours later. “We decided to send Zvika,” he said. Zvika\nZamir was the head of Mossad, and he would be going only as an observer. Any\noperation against the terrorists would still be in the hands of German units.\nThe German police’s bungled attempt to end the ordeal was especially\npainful because it was so predictable. I believe that if we had been there, at least\nsome of the eleven Israelis killed might not have lost their lives. The Germans\nlaunched an ambush at a NATO airfield outside Munich, when the terrorists and\nhostages were ostensibly on their way to board a flight for Cairo. We know now\nthat there was no properly co-ordinated plan. Too few police were deployed for\nthe operation. They were insufficiently armed, and they lacked relevant training\nor experience. The result: a bloodbath. As a final insult to the memory of the\nmurdered Israelis, although the three surviving terrorists were jailed, the\n133\nGerman government released them to meet the demands of the hijackers of a\nLufthansa airliner the following month.\nAdded to Israeli public’s shock over the massacre, there was anger at having\nto watch the murderers go free. In the weeks afterwards, I got occasional hints\nthat a sustained Israeli response was underway, though I didn’t know the details.\nI was not aware that it was Ahrahle, at the direction of Golda herself, who was\nco-ordinating it. Nor that a special Mossad team was at the center of the\noperation. Yet from news reports of a series of attacks on suspected leaders of\nBlack September, I, and most Israelis, assumed we were determined to convey a\nmessage which the Germans had not: that terror killings of the sort perpetrated\nin Munich would not go unanswered.\nIt was not until late 1972 that I knew the full scale of the operation. We had\nno formal ties with the Mossad, but our intelligence work occasionally\noverlapped. In mid-December, the sayeret’s intelligence liaison was approached\nwith a “theoretical question” by a couple of guys from the Mossad. Did we have\nthe capability to attack three separate flats in a pair of apartment buildings in\nBeirut. I sent back my preliminary answer a few days later. I said it was\npossible. But there was no way I could say for sure without more information.\nWould the people in the apartments be armed? Were there guards outside? Was\nthere a caretaker or concierge? Was there only one way in to the buildings, or\nalso rear entrances? Would we be able to get a plan of the interior of the\napartments?\nIn another month, they came up with most of the answers. The buildings\nwere fairly new, with glassed-in lobby areas and concierges. The Mossad men\nalso gave us a fairly detailed layout of two of the three apartments. They did not\nknow whether there were back entrances. They thought it was likely there were\nbodyguards, or at least some security detail posted outside. As for the people\nliving in the apartments, all of them were likely to have at least small arms.\nOver the next week or so, we raised a series of other questions. Mainly, I\nwanted to know whether they were sure the people we’d be looking for would\nbe at home. The Mossad officers said they were working on that, but were\nconfident of being able to confirm this before any operation happened. Though\nthey didn’t identify the people they were targeting, I had now learned, through\nAhrahle and others, what had been pretty obvious since the Mossad’s initial\napproach. They were Palestinian leaders with ties to Black September. “I think\nit’s possible,” I finally told them. “We’ll put a plan in place. We can finalize the\narrangements if you come back and say you want us to do it.”\n134\nNothing happened for several months. By the early spring of 1973, with my\ntwo-year term as sayeret commander winding down, I assumed the operation\nhad been vetoed. I could understand why. As we worked on our plan, it had\nbecome clear that getting into the heart of the Lebanese capital, hitting the\napartments and getting out again without starting a minor war would be by far\nthe most difficult mission we had attempted. I did not doubt that Sayeret Matkal\noffered the best chance of success. But it wouldn’t be easy. I figured that\nwhoever was making the decision had come to the same conclusion.\nI was on a weekend away with Nava and Michal in the Red Sea resort of\nEilat when things suddenly began to move. At around noon on Saturday, I got a\ncall from Talik’s deputy in the kirya. “Ehud,” he said, “we need you back here\nas soon as possible.” When I asked why, he said: “You remember how you were\napproached by someone with some questions, and you went back to them with a\nlist of other questions for them to answer?”\nI told Nava I’d been summoned to a meeting at the chief-of-staff’s office –\nthe kind of call of duty that both of us were now used to – and grabbed the first\ncommercial flight north. It got the the kirya early in the evening, and joined a\nmeeting that was already well underway. Dado was in his usual seat on the\nright-hand side of the table he used for staff discussions, flanked by Talik.\nAcross from them was Manno Shaked, the officer who had phoned me to tell\nme about the Sabena hijacking and who had now succeeded Raful Eitan as\nkatzhar, overall chief of the infantry and paratroopers. Beside him were the two\nMossad officers with whom I’d had most of my dealings about Beirut. They\nwere all staring at an aerial photo of the Lebanese capital, with an area marked\nin blue pen around a street called Rue Verdun.\nI entered and took one of the remaining chairs. Gesturing toward the image\nof Beirut, Dado turned to me. “Do you know this place?” he asked. Yes, I said.\nI’d seen the photo. Nodding toward the Mossad men, I said: “These two officers\nshowed it to me.”\n“Do you have an idea how to do this operation?” I told him that we didn’t\nhave a fully detailed operational plan. But I said we’d looked into the problems\nwe’d face. “We believe we can do it.” When he asked how, I outlined the\napproach we’d settled on: a small force, thirteen men, plus two from Mossad to\nact as drivers. We would need the Mossad men to go to Beirut ahead of us, and\nrent a pair of nice American cars, the kind typical tourists would use. We’d land\non the waterfront, well south of the most built-up parts of the city coastline, and\nmeet up with the rental cars. When we reached the apartment blocks, three\n135\ngroups of three men each would take care of the apartments. Four more would\nremain outside to deal with the concierges or security guards or any other\ninterference, and to command and co-ordinate. We’d leave the same way we\ncame in, by sea.\nDado nodded. I found out later that he’d asked the same question of Manno,\nwho had proposed a classic regular-army raid. They would block the road with\nten armed paratroopers on each end with the aim of holding off resistance, while\nanother two dozen went in to the apartments and attacked. I could only assume\nDado concluded that this almost certainly wouldn’t work, at least not without\nmajor trouble. It would certainly forfeit any chance of surprise.\n“The mission is yours,” he said. “Manno will be in overall command,\noffshore. Because we’re also planning to hit several other targets.”\nThe reason for the urgent summons was that the Mossad had confirmed all\nthree Palestinians would be in their apartments in 10 days’ time. Everyone\ninvolved realized that – given its complexity, the obvious risks, and the\ninevitable unknowns – the operation could well go wrong. In fact, one reason\nfor Dado’s “other targets” was to ensure that if it did, there would be successes\nelsewhere to provide a credible justification for having sent Israeli forces into\nBeirut. As we received further intelligence, new obstacles had to be factored in.\nThe main one was the presence of a gendarmerie, a Lebanese police post, at the\nbottom end of the street, only 500 feet or so from the apartments. And we would\nbe operating in a crowded, up-market residential area. We could only hope that\nat the hour we struck, most people would be in bed. Or out partying. This was,\nafter all, pre-civil war Beirut, the “Paris of the Middle East”.\nIn the years since, an extraordinary array of stories has grown up around the\nsayeret’s final and best-known mission during my term as commander,\nculminating in the dramatic version in Stephen Spielberg’s movie Munich. I\nremember reading in one earlier book, otherwise surprisingly accurate, about\nour five weeks of intensive training. Even the full 10 days which I thought we’d\nbeen given would have been a bonus. In fact, we had half that as a full team,\nsince our Mossad drivers, European-born Israelis, had to make their way\nthrough Paris to Beirut as tourists, rent the cars and scout out our route from the\nseashore to Rue Verdun.\nThere were four other operations planned alongside ours: three by paratroop\nunits and one by the Shayetet 13 SEALs, against a series of Fatah and\nDemocratic Front installations. Though all of them, like ours, would need help\n136\nfrom the SEALs in getting ashore, only one required direct co-ordination with\nus. This was an attack on a DFLP building a mile or so away in southern Beirut,\nled by Amnon Lipkin, the friend whose unit had faced one of the toughest\nbattles at Karameh. Amnon’s paratroop force would land with us and also pile\ninto Mossad rental cars. Our attacks would begin at the same time, with the\nmaximum prospect of retaining the advantage of surprise. When and if we both\ncompleted the operations and got away safely, we would meet up again on the\nseafront.\nFrom our first meeting, the morning after Dado gave me the go-ahead, I\nrealized I would have to make at least one change to the plan to rely on the core\nSabena team. There was no way, after his exclusion from the hijack rescue\nmission, that I could refuse Yoni when he pressed to be included. I added him to\nMookie Betzer’s force. I put the other two attack teams under a pair of young\nofficers named Amitai Nachmani and Zvika Gilad. Both were self-confident,\nnatural leaders. Both had other qualities I also knew we’d need: focus, and\ncalm. I would take charge on the street outside the targeted apartments, along\nwith Amiram Levin. With us would be Dov Bar, a Shayetet 13 officer, and our\nmedic, Shmuel Katz.\nIn the hangar at the sayeret base, we made mock-ups of the layout of the\napartments, using bedsheets for the walls and adjusting the dimensions as\nfurther bits of intelligence came in from Mossad. But the real work involved\nsimulating the whole operation, from the moment of our landing on jet-black\nrubber dinghies piloted by the SEALs. We found a new building development\nin north Tel Aviv with a pair of apartment blocks under construction. For two\nnights, we ran through the whole thing: setting off in the dinghies from a missile\nboat off the Israeli coast before midnight, meeting up with our Mossad drivers\non shore, making our way through the center of Tel Aviv to the apartment\ncomplexes and simulating the attack. I wanted to ensure we could pull off the\nwhole thing without anyone raising an alarm. The one problem came during the\nsecond run-through. A policeman drove by as we were “attacking” the\napartments. Dado managed to convince him that reporting us to his superiors\nwould not be an especially good idea.\nIn our debriefing discussions after that exercise, Dado identified a major\nproblem I’d overlooked. We would be entering Beirut dressed as civilians. Once\nwe got to the top end of Rue Verdun, we planned to approach the apartments as\nif we were party-goers returning from a night on the town. “It doesn’t look\nright,” Dado said. “More than a dozen party people walking, all men?” Mookie\n137\ncame up with the solution, one that would have the unintended effect of\nelevating our mission further in Israeli lore. The three least burly-looking of us\nwould go in as women: a boyish looking guy named Lonny Rafael, Amiram\nLevin, and me.\nStill, there was another, potentially deeper concern that had yet to be\naddressed. In all sayeret missions, since the beginning, we knew we might end\nup having to fight, shoot and, if necessary, kill. Yet now we would be going in\nwith the expectation of killing three specific men. We had black-and-white\nphotos: Mohammed Youssef al-Najar, or Abu Youssef, an operations officer in\nBlack September; Kamal Adwan, one of Arafat’s top military planners; and\nKamal Nasser, a member of his leadership circle and his spokesman.\nNominally, it was understood we would seize them and bring them back to\nIsrael if possible. I had us exercise how we’d do that. But none of us really\nbelieved that once our teams made it into the apartments, the Palestinians would\nsurrender. We assumed we would have no option but to kill them.\nThe killing was not the main issue. After all, I had drawn up a plan a year\nearlier to target Arafat himself. Though no one in the sayeret took any pleasure\nin having to take a life, at the end of the day we were a part of the army. Black\nSeptember, and Arafat’s Fatah more broadly, were not only at war with the\nexistence of Israel. They were behind a campaign of terror. Certainly there was\nno significant public opposition, after the horror of Munich, to going after those\nwho were deemed to be part of the operational or political direction of Black\nSeptember. Our uneasiness inside the unit, however, revolved around what I’d\nextolled as its “spirit” when I became commander. Beyond all the specific\nqualities we needed to succeed in our operations, our image of ourselves was as\nthinking soldiers. We might sometimes find it necessary to kill, but we were not\nkillers.\nAs I explained to each of the men I’d be leading on the operation, the\nMossad, Dado, and ultimately Golda had concluded that these three men were\nappropriate targets in the wake of Munich. As a battalion-level commander, I\ndid not feel I was in a position to challenge their judgement, unless we had been\nordered to carry out an attack that was clearly improper or immoral. In that case,\nI would have no hesitation in refusing. I said I viewed what we were being\nasked to do in Beirut not as an act of revenge, but a deterrent. It was a way of\nleaving no doubt in the minds of potential future terrorists that massacres like\nMunich carried a heavy price.\n138\nThe more difficult question for some in the unit was how we were delivering\nthat message: breaking into apartments in the middle of the night. Yes, each of\nthe men was almost sure to be armed. But these flats were their homes. Very\nlikely, members of their families would be there. If the operation went as\nplanned, it was hard to imagine how any of the men would have a chance of\nsurviving. My answer was that ideally we would face them on a battlefield. Yet\ngiven the nature of Black September, that was not going to happen. Mossad was\nright to conclude this was the only way to isolate and attack them.\nFor Amitai Nachmani, who would be leading the attack on one of the\napartments, my words were not enough. Twice, he came to see me. It was not\nthat he didn’t trust or respect me as his commander, he said. But before leading\nhis team into Beirut, he needed to satisfy himself that the people we were\nattacking, and the way we were attacking them, had been properly thought\nthrough by the people giving the orders. I told him I understood. I did not tell\nhim that I was actually proud of him for asking – which, although I’m sure he\nsensed it, was an omission I regretted when he lost his life in the Sinai Desert a\nfew months later. But I did go see Dado. I told him what Amitai had said. He\nneeded no convincing when I urged him to address the entire Beirut team and\nanswer their questions at our final planning meeting. He did so, explaining how\nand why the decision to target these three Palestinians had been reached, to the\nsatisfaction of Amitai and the others.\nWe set off by missile boat from Haifa on the afternoon of April ninth. To my\nrelief, since I suffer from seasickness, the Mediterranean was calm as we\nheaded west towards Cyprus, before circling back in the direction of the\nLebanese coast after nightfall. I ran through the plan a final time with each\nmember of the team and then joined Amiram and Lonny in transforming\nourselves as best we could into credible dates for the evening. I’d vetoed dresses\nor high heels, in favor of flared slacks and flats. We used standard-issue army\nsocks to pad out our bras. The Mossad had recruited a volunteer from a Tel\nAviv beauty parlor to help us with our lipstick, blue eyeliner and eye shadow.\nThe final touch was our wigs. Amiram and Lonny were blondes. I went as a\nstylish brunette.\nI’m reluctant to take issue with the Spielberg version of events, if only\nbecause he had my part played by someone undeniably better looking than I\nwas, even as a 31-year-old. But in Munich, we are shown zooming into a\ncrowded harbor area on a line of motor boats, changing into drag only once\nwe’ve sprinted ashore, opening fire on a dockside kiosk and shooting our way\n139\ninto town like something out of the wild west. Had any of that happened, we\nwould have started a small-scale war, not to mention run the very real risk of\nnot getting out alive.\nIn fact, we left the missile boat, Manno’s offshore command post, in motor\ndinghies out of earshot of Beirut and cut the engines as we got closer to the\nshore. All of us, including the “women”, were wrapped in ponchos to avoid\nshowing up on Rue Verdun soaking wet. After getting out of the dinghies, we\nwere carried ashore by the SEALs to make sure we stayed dry. All of us had\nloose-fitting jackets. The attack teams used them to conceal Uzis, explosive\ncharges to blow the locks on the apartment doors if they couldn’t be forced\nopen, a hand grenade or two and flashlights for the dash up the stairs. One\nmember of each team had a large plastic bag, with orders to take away any\neasily accessible documents for Mossad analysts back home. As the mother of\nthe brood, I also had a large purse, in which I carried our radio to communicate\nwith the team leaders and with Manno on the missile boat if necessary.\nOur SEAL pilots steered us well away from the more built-up part of the\nseafront towards the Coral Beach, one of the private clubs on the southern end\nof the shoreline. Four rented station wagons were waiting, two of them for us\nand two for Amnon’s squad. Amnon set off toward the DFLP target. We headed\nnorth towards the center of town. In the Spielberg film, my speaking role\nconsisted of two words, my name, as I introduced myself to my driver. In fact,\nwe had already met: during the run-through exercises in Tel Aviv. After we got\ninto the cars, I asked him how his scouting of the route had gone. He said\nbasically OK, but that he’d noticed a couple of cops patrolling near the top of\nVerdun on one of his drive-bys. I assured him it would be fine. There would be\nno reason for a policeman to suspect what we were up to, or who we were. Still,\nI could tell he was nervous. “What’s wrong?” I asked. He hesitated before\nreplying. “I’ve never been in a place where there’s live fire,” he said. I told him\nnot to worry. He still wouldn’t be. “You’re going to be parked around the\ncorner, until it’s over. Then, it’s just about getting home.”\nWhen we reached the top of Verdun, it was about ten minutes after one in\nthe morning. Our cars pulled over. I took Mookie’s arm as we began walking\nthe 150 feet or so to the first of the apartment buildings. The others followed in\nknots of two or three. Both Mookie and I saw a policeman approaching on the\nsidewalk. “Ignore him,” I whispered. We weaved a few inches to the side to let\nhim pass. The buildings were as we’d expected, with their lobbies set back from\na covered terrace in front. As the other teams made their way to the second\n140\nbuilding, I stayed with Mookie. His job, along with Yoni in his expanded team,\nwas to deal with Abu Youssef, the Black September operations officer. The\nconcierge must have been on a coffee break. The lobby was empty. The door\nwas unlocked, so they sprinted toward the interior staircase and made their way\nup.\nAdwan, the Fatah military man, and Kamal Nasser lived next door. Adwan,\nAmitai’s target, was on the second floor. Nasser was on the third. As the teams\nraced into the other building, Amiram and I posted ourselves near one of the\nterrace pillars, occasionally exchanging a few words of what we hoped would\npass as girl talk. The SEAL officer and Dr Katz were near the top end of the\nstreet as lookouts. We seemed seconds away from what had all the makings of\nthe operation we’d rehearsed back in Tel Aviv. The one major problem I’d\nexpected – security guards posted outside – hadn’t materialized. We’d been told\nby the Mossad to look out for a grey Mercedes, but it wasn’t there.\nThe next stage was for each team leader to press the transmit button three\ntimes on his radio. When I’d heard from all of them, I would send a signal back.\nThen, at the count of five, each of them was supposed to start the attack.\nMookie’s signal came first. Yet before either of the other two teams checked in,\nthe trouble began. Suddenly, the door of a red Renault flew open almost directly\nacross the street from where Amiram and I were standing. A tall, sturdy, darkhaired\nman climbed out. He looked across at us. He opened his leather jacket.\nHe pulled out a pistol and started to approach us. “Ein breirah,” I whispered to\nAmiram. “No choice.” To this day, I remember the shock on the man’s face as\nhe watched us – a pair of 30something women – open our jackets and pull out\nUzis. Fortunately for him, we’d had to make allowances for concealment in\nchoosing our weapons. We’d left the Uzis’ stabilizing shoulder braces behind.\nAs our first shots hit, he had half-turned to run. Though wounded, he somehow\ngot back in the car. We kept shooting but he managed to drag himself out of the\nfar door and roll behind a waist-high wall on the other side of the street. One of\nour shots obviously hit the electrical innards of the Renault, because the car\nhorn began blaring full-blast, as if someone had set off a modern-day car alarm.\nSo much for the element of surprise.\nI saw three sets of lights suddenly come on in the otherwise dark apartment\nbuildings. They were in the flats that Mossad had identified. At least that part of\nthe plan was intact. These were the Palestinians we were after, and it seemed\nthey were at home. Seconds later, I heard an explosion. It was from Abu\n141\nYoussef’s apartment, the one Mookie and Yoni had been assigned. Then, bursts\nof gunfire from the other building.\nA Land Rover was approaching from the gendarmerie at the bottom of the\nroad. We waited until it was about 50 feet away. Amiram and I opened fire, then\nDov and Shmuel Katz as well. The driver lost control and crashed into the side\nof the Renault. There were at least four policemen inside. They, too, rolled\nbehind the wall on the far side of the street. Using the terrace columns for cover,\nwe kept shooting. Within a minute or so, only a couple of the cops fired back.\nThough the three Palestinians could not know the reason for the gunfire and\nthe wailing of the car horn, they were now on their guard. When Mookie had\nblown open the door to Abu Youssef’s flat – and he, Yoni and the other two\nmembers of his team ran into the apartment – he saw the Black September man\npeering out from the bedroom. Mookie raised his Uzi but the Palestinian ducked\ninside and shut the door. All four of them fired through through the door. When\nthey went in, they found not only Abu Youssef but his wife, both dead. When\nZvika’s team burst in on Kamal Nasser, he, too, was ready. Crouching behind a\ndesk, he raised an automatic pistol and fired, grazing one of the team on the leg.\nBut in a burst of Uzi bullets, he, too, was killed.\nI suspect that Amitai’s face-to-face meeting with Dado may have saved his\nlife. When he and his team cornered Kamal Adwan, he had an AK-47 raised and\nready to fire. Without even a split second’s unconscious hesitation, Amitai fired\nfirst. His only regret afterwards was that Adwan’s wife and children saw it\nhappen, and that when they’d blasted open the apartment door, the force blew\nopen the door of a nearby flat, killing an elderly Italian woman. She had been\none of the Mossad’s sources of information on the Beirut apartments.\nMookie’s team came down first. They joined us, crouching behind the\ncolumns, as sporadic shots continued from one of the policemen behind the wall\nacross the street. When a second police Land Rover approached, I at first\nsignaled the others to let it pass. But when it suddenly accelerated toward us, we\nopened fire. It swerved, crashing into the rear bumper of the other one.\nThe other teams were back down now. I shouted for Dov to have the drivers\nbring the station wagons from around the corner. When we began to pull away,\na third police Land Rover appeared. It sped up behind us. Mookie tossed back a\ngrenade. The last thing I saw as we made it to the end of the block and headed\ntoward the seafront was the front end of the vehicle exploding. We dropped\nhollow, needle-sharp spikes out the window of the car as we left, so I knew that\n142\nany other pursuing vehicle would be in no shape to follow for very long. But we\nstill had to avoid trouble on our way back out. I knew it would be a risk to go\nback to the Coral Beach, so we took the shortest route to the sea, straight out to\nthe Corniche, the city’s main avenue along the Mediterranean. As we got closer,\nwe could hear gunfire. Obviously, the police, and the Palestinian militias,\nrealized something was not right. The advantage we had was that they would\nhave no idea what had happened on Rue Verdun, who we were, or where we\nwere going.\nNo sooner had we joined the Corniche than I saw another police Land Rover\nabout 200 yards ahead of us. This one had a spotlight on the roof, panning both\nsides of the road. I told the driver to slow down. About 100 yards or so later,\nreaching the place where we’d arranged for the SEALs to meet us, he and the\nother station wagon pulled over to the side of the road. The Land Rover kept\ndriving. We slid down a steep embankment nearly 30 feet to the sea. Two of the\nthree assault teams had bags full of documents as well. We swam out to the\ndinghies. When we had hoisted ourselves in, we headed out at first by paddle,\nthen under engine power, to the missile boat. The whole operation had taken\nabout a half an hour, only 10 minutes on Rue Verdun.\nI radioed Manno on the way to the missile boat. A half-dozen words: the\nagreed code phrase for “mission accomplished, targets achieved.” I could hear\nrelief in his voice when he replied. At first, I assumed that was because they\nhadn’t heard from us during the operation. Our radio link to the missile boat had\ngone down when we entered the built-up area around the apartment blocks.\nGenuinely, despite Manno’s suspicion that I’d cut the connection. Yet he had\nother reasons to exhale when he heard we had got out safely. Amnon’s team had\nhad a much tougher time. They met resistance from the moment they arrived at\nthe DFLP building. Two of his men were killed, another wounded. They set off\ntheir explosive charges, but had to fight their way out. They only barely\nmanaged to escape, carrying their fallen comrades with them and linking up\nwith another team of SEALs near the Coral Beach.\nIt was a little before six in the morning when I got home. I was careful not to\nwake Nava. I’d changed out of my slacks and flats and surrendered my wig on\nthe missile boat. But I didn’t have the energy to deal with my makeup. The next\nthing I remember was my wife standing by our bed as I stirred awake around\nnoon the next day. She looked at my eye makeup and lipstick, shook her head,\nand smiled. She didn’t need to ask where I’d been. Israel radio had been full of\nnews about a major operation in Beirut.\n143\n* * *\nA few weeks later, my term as commander ended. The handover to my\nsuccessor, Giora Zorea, turned out to be more elaborate than my arrival, though\nnot at my instigation. With both Talik and Avraham in attendance, Dado\npresented me with my fifth tzalash. It was not for Beirut. Not for the operation\nagainst the Syrian officers, or the unprecedented access our intelligence\nmissions were providing into Egypt’s military communications. Dado said it\nwas for all of the above. And not just for leading the unit of which I’d been a\npart almost from the start. It was for my part in bringing it to maturity. When I\nreplied, I am sure everyone knew I was speaking from the heart in saying that\nmy every moment with Sayeret Matkal had been a privilege. And that this latest\ncommendation was an award for the achievements the whole sayeret.\nDado did me another good turn. As my stint as commander drew to an end, I\nknew what I hoped to do next in the army: to use my tank training to work my\nway up the command chain in the armored corps. But like past sayeret\ncommanders, it was assumed I would first spend time at the US Marine Corps\nstaff college in Quantico, Virginia. I had other ideas. I wanted to exercise other\nparts of my mind, by doing postgraduate work at a normal American university.\nDado agreed.\nI still had to get accepted. The first step was to take the post-graduate entry\nexam, the GRE. There were two parts to it. The first involved mathematics and\nabstract thinking, the second English language. If my fate had rested on my\nEnglish grade, I’d have ended up at Quantico. I finished in the 28 th percentile.\nBut in the other part, I was in the 99.6 th percentile. I applied to four universities:\nHarvard, Yale, MIT and Stanford. Amazingly, I got accepted by all of them. I\nchose Stanford, mainly because it allowed a far greater latitude in choosing my\nprogram of study. Also, the weather.\nIn early August 1973, Nava and I joined my parents and hers on a sunny\nafternoon in Mishmar Hasharon to celebrate Michal’s third birthday and say\ngoodbye. We were heading to Palo Alto, California, with every expectation of\ntwo years of intellectual stimulation, new friends, new experiences and\nsomething approximating a more normal family life. My “other” family, the\nIsraeli army, also had reason to believe a period of new possibilities lay ahead.\nThe threat of terror remained, of course. There had also been a brief bout of\n144\nnerves over military maneuvers by Anwar Sadat a few weeks earlier. But that\nhad come to nothing. In no small part due to the success of the raid on Rue\nVerdun, Israel’s generals believed the balance of strength and security was on\nour side and that, at least for a while, Israel could breathe a bit more easily.\nBut we were all about to be proven spectacularly wrong.\n145\nChapter Nine\nThe phone rang in our apartment in Palo Alto at 4:30 in the morning. We had\nbeen in the US for barely six weeks. It was the Sixth of October 1973: Yom\nKippur, the holiest date on the Jewish calendar. I was still a bit groggy from the\nnight before. We had been out at a get-to-know-you event for some of the\nseveral dozen Israelis, and several hundred American Jewish students, at\nStanford. While I only vaguely recognized the voice on the other end of the line,\nher words instantly jolted me awake: “The boss is busy,” she said. “But he\nwants you to know. A war has started back home.”\nHer boss was Motta Gur, who was by now Israel’s military attaché in\nWashington and was my nominal commander for my period in the United\nStates. “I need to talk to Motta,” I said. She passed him the phone. “I want you\nto know I’m going back,” I told him. Motta’s reply took my mind back 15\nmonths, to our on-again-off-again mission to abduct the Syrian officers, with\nMotta and Dado in the command post, intent on reining in the “young bulls” of\nthe sayeret. “Ehud,” he said, “from what I’m hearing, I don’t think we are\nmissing a major war.”\n“What’s this we?” I said. Motta was a general, at the upper reaches of the\narmed forces, officially posted to Washington. I was a young officer, just\nstarting to work my way up the chain of field command. “I can’t afford to miss\neven a non-major war,” I said. “I’ll check in with you when I get to New York.”\n“Major” would turn out to be, if anything, an understatement. Yet all I knew,\nas I kissed Nava and Michal goodbye and got a cab to San Francisco airport,\nwas that Israel was again at war. By the time I joined the swarm of Israelis\naround the El Al desk at Kennedy eight hours later, the picture was clearer, and\nmore worrying with each new report from back home. Surprise attacks by Syria\nand Egypt – armies we’d not just defeated, but humiliated, six years earlier –\nhad pinned down and pushed back our forces on the Golan Heights and in the\nSinai. Without any advance call-up, many reservists were only now reaching the\nfront lines.\nAs hundreds of people pressed for seats on the El Al flight, I was fortunate to\nreceive a boost up the pecking order from another man in line. Since the Sabena\noperation, the existence of Sayeret Matkal had become a bit less secret. Still, the\nidentity of the sayeret commander was known to just a few people outside the\nunit. So skittish were the army security people that before I’d left for Stanford,\n146\nthey even insisted I change my name. I was no longer Ehud Brog. I’d\nHebraicized it: to Barak, which seemed near enough to the original. Among the\nfew dozen outside the unit who did know about my role, however, were\nparatroopers who’d joined us on various missions. One of them now told the El\nAl people who I was. Not only was I given a seat on the first overnight plane\nback to Tel Aviv. I found myself helping the airline establish a priority for\nassigning seats to others: first, active officers in fighting units: armor, infantry,\nthe air force. Then, reservists, with the emphasis on those who’d seen active\nservice most recently.\nAs we were waiting to board, I phoned Uzi Dayan and asked him to meet me\nat Lod the next morning. Then I called Motta again. “Ehud,” he said, with no\ntrace of irony, “it is an extremely serious war. Syrian tanks are getting close to\nthe outer fences of Nafakh” – our main command post on the Golan. “Good\nluck.”\nUzi was waiting for me when we landed. Walking to his car, we ran into two\nreserve armored officers who had also just arrived home. They expected to be\nsent north, to help beat back the Syrian advance. When they asked me where I\nthought I’d be going, I said, truthfully, I had no idea. “Wherever I can help,” I\nsaid. Uzi drove us to the bor, the bunker built two floors underground in the\nkirya. Usually, it functioned as the day-to-day operations center. But it was\nwhere the commanders of the armed forces operated during times of war.\nAt officers’ school, we’d heard and read about the importance of throwing\nthe enemy “off balance”. Now, we were the ones off balance. The faces I saw\naround me were gray and drawn. There were dead looks in the eyes of the\ncommanders and their staff. Some 30 hours after the surprise attack, all the selfconfidence\nwe’d felt since 1967 seemed to have evaporated. I looked into\nseveral of the rooms where, months earlier, I’d run through operational plans as\nsayeret commander. Inside each, a large wall map traced the course of the\nfighting. Israeli forces were marked in blue, the Syrians and Egyptians in red,\nwith a timestamp for each position report scribbled at the side in black magic\nmarker. But I saw that the latest addition was from at least twelve hours earlier.\nIt was as if we’d lost track of what was happening, or were simply\noverwhelmed by the pace of events.\nI spoke briefly with Talik as he walked along the corridor. He looked 10\nyears older than when I’d last seen him. Then I spotted Ahrahle Yariv, who had\nbeen called back into military intelligence at the start of the war. Looking\nsurprised to see me back in Israel, he pulled me close to him. “It’s important\n147\nthat you came back,” he said. “We’ll need each and every one of you to get the\njob done.” Then he hugged me again. It was as if, knowing I would soon be\nheading for the front line, he wondered whether we’d see each other again.\nI made my way to the office that the chief of staff used in the bunker and\nasked Dado’s secretary if I could see him. As she was deciding whether to let\nme in, he emerged. Though obviously aware of the seriousness of the situation,\nDado radiated his usual calm and confidence. For the first time, I felt a bit more\nhopeful. “Ma nishmah, Ehud? he asked, in Israelis’ everyday greeting. “What’s\nup?” I told him I’d just come from the airport. “I can help in special forces,\ninfantry, armor. Whichever is most needed.”\n“Leading a tank unit,” he said. “They’ve suffered heavy losses. Go see\nTzipori.” Motke Tzipori was in charge of organizing the armored units. He sent\nme to Julis, the training base between Tel Aviv and Beersheva, where tanks\nfrom maintenance units around the country were being brought. Once they were\nreasonably operational, and as more reservists arrived from abroad, I would lead\na makeshift battalion to help reinforce our badly depleted forces in the Sinai.\n* * *\nI was just one of dozens of officers, in command of thousands of tireless and\ncourageous troops called on to try to turn the tide. Most were reservists. Many,\nlike me, had rushed home in the knowledge that for the first time since 1948,\nthere was the real risk Israel would be defeated. By the time I got my battle\norders – October 14, the ninth day of the war – Israeli forces on the Golan, at\nenormous cost, had managed to turn back the Syrian attack. In this war, the men\nfrom Sayeret Matkal were not bystanders. Most of the unit joined the fightback\nin the north, where, under Yoni Netanyahu’s command, they took on and\ndefeated a Syrian commando force in the heart of the Golan. Yoni himself\nrisked his life to rescue a wounded officer from another unit behind enemy\nlines.\nIn the Sinai, however, the situation remained dire. An initial counterattack,\nlaunched while I was on my way to Julis, ended up in tatters, with whole\nbattalions all but destroyed, as our tanks came under fire from rocket-propelled\ngrenades and, above all, the wire-guided Saggers. Israel’s main advantage in\n1967 – our command of the skies – was all but gone. By moving their surface-\n148\nto-air missiles to the bank of the Suez Canal after the truce in the War of\nAttrition, the Egyptians had created an effective no-fly zone a dozen miles into\nthe Sinai. After the failed counter-attack, with the commander of the air force\nwarning that we were nearing our minimum “red line” number of fighter jets,\nGolda contacted the Americans to propose a cease-fire in the south. But having\nretaken the Suez Canal and pushed into the Sinai, President Sadat was in no\nmood to call a halt to the fighting. The only way we were going to end the war\nwas to retake the canal and defeat the even larger Egyptian forces on the other\nside.\nTo the extent that my part in war was different from other junior officers, it\nwas because of my history in Sayeret Matkal. Other Israeli sayerets were\nattached to specific fighting forces. Sayeret Golan, for instance, was part of the\nGolani infantry brigade in the north; Sayeret Tzanhanim, was part of the\nparatroopers. But “matkal” is the Hebrew word for the general staff, since it was\nthe generals in military headquarters who had allowed Avraham Arnan to create\nthe unit. From the start, we had answered directly to the kirya, which ultimately\nhad to approve our operations. When I rushed back from Stanford at the start of\nthe war, I was still just a 31-year-old lieutenant-colonel. I had spent two years in\ncommand of the equivalent of an infantry battalion. But I knew, and in many\ncases had worked with, the men at the very top of the armed forces, including\nDado, the chief of staff. So while other young reservists were reporting to their\nformer units for assignment, my first port of call was the command bunker,\nwhere Dado himself, aware that I’d done intensive tank training before taking\ncommand of the sayeret, ensured that I would play my part in trying to turn\nback the Egyptian advances. I also knew, or at least had met, many of the\ngenerals plotting the counteroffensive in the command bunker in the south:\nShmuel Gonen, known as “Gorodish”, who was head of the southern command;\nArik Sharon, who had left the same job for politics a few months earlier, but\nwas now commanding a division near the canal; and Chaim Bar-Lev, the former\nchief-of-staff whom Golda had called back into emergency service. I even knew\nthe bunker. It was Um-Hashiba, the command and intelligence post from which\nwe had run Sayeret Matkal operations into Egypt after 1967.\nSo during the last, decisive 10 days of the war, I would witness first-hand the\ntension among our top commanders in the Sinai, especially between Sharon and\nGorodish, since Arik wasted few opportunities to suggest, rightly but not always\nhelpfully, that his successor was woefully out of his depth. I would lead my\ncompany back across the canal with one of the other main armored brigades in\nthe Sinai; take out Egyptian missile sites and help restore our jets’ command of\n149\nthe skies; strike out alone at night, with sayeret-issue night goggles, to bring\nback the surviving soldiers after we realized we’d lost one of our APCs in a\nbattle with Egyptians; and even, because I’d been there before on sayeret\nmissions, leading a joint armored force across the Egyptian desert to complete\nthe encirclement of Sadat’s Third Army and effectively end the war.\nStill, the memory which has stayed with me longest – summoning back all\nthe miscues and misjudgements of some of Israel’s top commanders, and the\nterrible price paid by the men on the ground to turn things around – was the\nfight for an experimental agricultural facility located just a few miles back from\nour side of the Suez Canal.\n* * *\nOn Israeli military maps, it was called the Chinese Farm. In fact, it was\nJapanese experts who helped set it up in the then-Egyptian Sinai before the Six-\nDay War. When we captured it in 1967, deciphering the characters on the\nequipment had evidently proven beyond our linguistic capabilities. Thus,\nChinese Farm. Now, it was back in Egyptian hands. The sprawling complex,\nwith its web of large irrigation ditches, controlled the main transport corridor\nfrom the Sinai to the bank of the canal.\nBefore dawn on October 16, one of the battalions in Arik Sharon’s brigade,\nunder a veteran paratroop commander named Danny Matt, had managed to\ncross the canal on rubber rafts with an advance force of some 750 men and a\nfew dozen tanks. But it was a precarious beachhead, vulnerable to Egyptian air\nstrikes, artillery and Sagger fire. Hopes for any large-scale Israeli counterattack\nrested on moving forward an enormous roller bridge, and hundreds more tanks,\nto complete the crossing – impossible without retaking the Chinese Farm.\nThe first I knew of the scale of Egyptian resistance there was about four in\nthe morning on the seventeenth. I got a radio call ordering me to get my\nbattalion ready to move, ASAP. We were attached the other main armored\nforce, along with Arik’s, assigned to lead the crossing. It was under the\ncommand of Avraham “Bren” Adnan, the former overall commander of Israeli\ntank forces. “You’re going north of Tirtur 42,” Bren’s operations officer told\nme. Even without checking our coded map, I knew it was the road running\nalong the upper edge of the Chinese Farm. He told me that the parachutists of\n150\nBattalion 890, under Yitzhik Mordechai, were in trouble. “Go. Find them. Help\nget them out.”\nI knew Yitzhik personally, from his years in the paratroopers’ elite Battalion\n890. I knew the man who was now in overall command of the paratroopers even\nbetter: Uzi Yairi, who was in charge of Sayeret Matkal during my final years of\nreserve duty at Hebrew University. Helicoptered into the Sinai just hours\nearlier, the paratroopers had been sent to the Chinese Farm shortly before\nmidnight. As I would soon learn, they had no more idea than I did about what\nthey were about to face. They were told they were going in simply to clear out\nbands of “tank-hunters”. They weren’t told of repeated attempts by some of\nArik’s top tank, paratroop and reconnaissance units to take the farm over the\nprevious 36 hours – attacks which had not only failed, but had cost dozens of\ntanks and hundreds of men. Without artillery, armor or air support, they\nimmediately came under rifle, machine-gun, mortar and heavy artillery fire.\nOur job was to get them out. Ordering my men to get ready for our first\ncombat mission of the war, I found myself face-to-face with a distraught and\ndetermined friend from military intelligence. Yishai Izhar had arrived at Bren’s\nheadquarters the day before. When he saw me, he’d asked to join my battalion.\nHe was a brilliant electronics engineer and was about to assume command of\nthe technology unit in military intelligence. I told him we already had our\ncomplement of tank crews, and I knew he’d never had any armored training. So\nI found him a place in one of our APCs. But before joining military intelligence,\nhe’d been a company commander in Battalion 890. Hearing that we were going\nto rescue his old unit, he insisted on joining me on the lead tank. I tried several\ntimes to refuse, but he said I had no moral authority to stash him in an APC\nwhen we were going in to rescue his friends and comrades. Aware that each\nwasted minute might cost more of the paratroopers’ lives, I relented. I told\nYishai he’d be sitting across from me on the turret, right above Yasha Kedmi,\nanother friend who, having served under me in my first tank company in the\nWar of Attrition, had asked to join back at Julis. Yasha was our loader and\nradio-operator. He got Yishai a machine gun, extra magazines for his Uzi and a\nbox of grenades.\nWe moved out through wave-like dunes in total darkness. After the first few\nmiles, the terrain leveled out a bit. Still, the sand was deep and the going slow.\nWhen we got within a couple of miles of where I assumed Yitzhik and his men\nwould be, I radioed him. His voice was chilling. “They’re very close to us,\nshooting,” he said. “I’ve got many wounded. Get here as quick as you can.”\n151\nAs we got closer, I could still see no sign of them. As dawn was about break,\nI radioed Yitzhik to suggest he fire off a flare, but he thought that would put\nthem at even greater mercy of the Egyptians. Instead, he tossed out a smoke\ngrenade. We spotted it, more than a half-a-mile away, slightly below us and to\nour right. I ordered us forward, leaving my second tank company behind for\ncovering fire. I led Company A, which included my most experienced tank\ncommander, Moshe Sukenik. Immediately behind us were our APCs, including\ntwo carrying our medical team. My aim was to engage the Egyptian fire while\nstarting to evacuate Yitzhik’s men to one of the long, dry, irrigation ditches, 600\nyards behind us.\nWe moved forward in a broad line with my command tank in the center. We\nheld our fire until we got closer. I still couldn’t see exactly where the men of\nBattalion 890 were and didn’t want to risk hitting them. Only when we got\nwithin about 70 yards did I spot the first of the paratroopers. They were in\ngroups of three or four in a thin line stretching 200 or 300 yards on either side\nof us. They were lying behind whatever cover they could find: a bush, a clump\nof debris, a small rise in the sand. Some were firing. Others were wounded.\nFrom just a few yards away, Egyptian infantrymen were raking them with rifle\nand machine-gun fire. They were now shooting at us as well, and we returned\nfire. But the Egyptians, far outnumbering Yitzhik’s men, were spread out in a\nnetwork of foxholes, in some places connected by trenches. As we moved\nforward, I ordered my APC commander to start evacuating the paratroopers\nback to the irrigation ditch, with the support of a further group of courageous\nreservists from another nearby APC unit.\nA shell suddenly exploded 20 yards ahead of me. Others rained in around\nour tanks. The source of the fire was straight ahead, about 1,300 yards away:\nthree SU-100s, Soviet-made World War Two “tank destroyers”. I trained the\nmain gun of my tank on one of the SU-100s and ordered the gunner to fire. I\nused the battalion-wide radio frequency so the others would hear the order. But\nwhen the dust and smoke had cleared, the SU-100s were still there. I ordered a\nsight correction and said, again: “Fire”. Still, we missed. It was only then that I\nrealized why. Almost none of the tanks brought brought into Julis from the\nmaintenance units had included their “commander’s notebook” with their\nchecklists for calibrating and firing – a major problem, since many of the\nreservists had last been in a tank years before. I ordered the gunners to use their\ntelescopes, parallel to the main gun, instead.\n152\nWe were being hit by small-arms and RPG fire from all sides. On the turret\nof our tank, Yishai and I were firing back, our Uzis on automatic, and throwing\ngrenades. I could hear bullets pinging off the turret and the body of the tank.\nThen, from our far right flank, came the shoulder-mounted Saggers, honing in\nwith their eerie blue-red glow, juddering towards us as the Egyptian soldiers\ncorrected their trajectories. One of the missiles barely missed us, and the silky\nwire from its guidance mechanism was tangled over our turret. I tried using my\nbinoculars to identify where they were coming from, but it was no use.\nTo my right, I could see that the APCs had completed their first evacuation\nrun and were coming back for more of Yitzhik’s men. There was a raggedness\nabout it all: one APC, then a couple of others, then a gap, then another one or\ntwo. They were doing whatever they could, whenever they could, as the\nEgyptian fire continued to intensify. A few of Yitzhik’s men, whether desperate\nor dazed, simply stood up and starting walking west, toward the canal, only to\nbe cut down by Egyptian gunfire.\nI directed Moshe Sukenik to take half the company and head toward the\nSaggers to try to take them out, even though we both knew that he’d have to\nrisk heavy fire before they got close enough. He had two-inch mortars on his\nturret, but their range was only 500 yards, far less than the Saggers. Every 45\nseconds or so, a salvo of Saggers zeroed in on our tanks and APCs. Within a\ncouple of minutes, two of the tanks were hit. One was on fire. The SU-100 tankdestroyers\nwere still there as well. Egyptian infantrymen were spraying us with\nsmall arms fire. The whole area was swathed in grayish smoke. Every minute or\ntwo, another tank or APC took a direct hit. There was a smell, too, which, once\nexperienced, never leaves your memory: the scent of burnt human flesh.\nThe fire from the foxholes was getting worse. “Run over them,” I ordered\nmy tank driver. “Start with the foxhole in front of us.” He jerked us forward and\nwe plowed over the first Egyptian position. “Reverse, get the one to the right,” I\nsaid. As he backed up, I was shocked to see a surviving Egyptian soldier,\nshrugging off a thick blanket of sand from his shoulders, raise an RPG launcher\nat us from just 15 feet away. We were close enough to look into each other’s\neyes. I raised my Uzi and shot him before he could fire. Rifle and grenade fire\ncontinued from along the line of foxholes. A second length of the Saggers’ silklike\nguidance wire tangled over our main gun. Yishai was firing at the\nEgyptians from the other side of the tank. We both tossed grenades in the\ndirection of the worst of the gunfire.\n153\nIt was then, suddenly, that I saw Yishai had taken a bullet in the side of his\nneck. Blood was spurting from the wound. His face was contorted in pain. He\nlooked at me, raising his hands upward, as if to say: “I did my best. It’s over\nnow.” I pressed hard on the wound, trying to stem the flow. But he slipped out\nof my grasp and collapsed into Yasha Kedmi’s arms. Yasha propped him up and\nkept trying to staunch the bleeding. I turned toward the Egyptian soldier who\nhad shot Yishai, less than 20 feet to my left. Keeping myself as low as possible\nabove the turret, I fired into his chest. He tumbled into the foxhole. As I kept\nshooting, Yasha told me Yishai was dead. “Are you sure?” I asked. When he\nsaid yes, I ordered the driver to back up. We drove a few dozen feet, to where a\ngroup of the paratroopers was taking cover. With their help, we lowered his\nbody from the tank, and then returned to the battle.\nBarely ten minutes had passed since it began. Two SU-100s were now\nspewing smoke and out of action. The third had withdrawn. But the Egyptians\nwere still firing. Five of our tanks had been hit. Two were on fire. One APC was\nsmoldering, its commander severely wounded. I knew that if we stayed much\nlonger, we would end up like other armored units during Israel’s first, failed\ncounterattack in the early days of the war. We would risk being wiped out. As\nfar as I could tell, all the surviving paratroopers had been brought out or had\nmanaged to hobble to the irrigation ditch. I ordered Sukenik to abandon his\nattempt to take out the Saggers, and we withdrew behind the irrigation ditch.\nIt was only then that I realized that alongside two of our crippled tanks there\nwas still a group of a dozen men: six crew members from my battalion and six\nof Yitzhik’s men. It took nearly two hours to get them out. We used our tank\nguns to try to reduce the intensity of the fire from the Egyptians around them. I\nordered one of our APCs to go get them. I rounded up all our smoke grenades,\nand the APC crew used them to create a smokescreen, the only way I could\nthink of to reduce the danger of being targeted by the Saggers. It worked, but it\nrequired incredible guts for the men in the APC to pull it off.\nThe battle had required guts of every man in the battalion. They had found a\nway to conquer the first and most powerful enemy on a battlefield: fear. I felt it,\ntoo. But it’s easier for a commander. When you’re leading people into combat,\nyou don’t have time to be afraid. You have to assess and evaluate, second by\nsecond, everything going on around you. You have to make instant decisions\nand ensure they’re being carried out. The people under your command are\nwaiting to hear your voice, and watching your actions, too. If you lose control at\nany point, not only is your life at stake. Theirs are too.\n154\nEarly that evening, we were ordered to rejoin Bren’s division to be ready for\nthe crossing. When I reported that three of my soldiers were still missing, I was\nordered to inform the commander of the battalion replacing us to find the\nmissing men. The fight for the Chinese Farm was still not over. It would be\nanother 12 hours before, in a co-ordinated push by a strengthened armor and\ninfantry force, Israeli forces finally drove most of the Egyptians out. What\ntenuous gains we’d made until then had come at an enormous price. Of\nYitzhik’s 300 men, nearly 40 were killed, and many others wounded. I’d led\naround 130 people into battle. More than 35 were injured. Eleven were dead,\nincluding Yishai Izhar and Motti Ben-Dror, our medical officer, killed while\ntreating the wounded. One of our missing soldiers was found alive. The other\ntwo could only be brought home for burial.\nAs I began to hear the details of the previous days’ fighting, I became more\nastonished, and angry. Israel’s tactics in the battle for the Chinese Farm had\ninvolved a series of piecemeal strikes by units obviously too small, and\ninadequately supported or co-ordinated, to succeed. The problem wasn’t the\nchoice of units. No one could doubt the record of Battalion 890, or of the men\nArik had sent in before Yitzhik arrived. But there was no way they were going\nto take the area on their own. I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t an attempt\nto assemble a force that might actually have been strong enough: parachutists,\ntanks, artillery. I felt I knew at least part of the answer from the two nights I had\nspent in the Um-Hashiba command post before joining Bren’s division. By\ndawn on October 16, the first of Arik’s men had crossed the canal. By the\nafternoon, although the big roller-bridge was still not ready, a smaller pontoon\nbridge was available. Everyone knew we needed to get control of the Chinese\nFarm. But all the field commanders were focused the real task, and the real\nprize: crossing the canal and defeating the Egyptians on the other side.\nNow, at least, the main crossing was underway. Bren had chanced the fact\nthat, with Yitzhik pinned down at the Chinese Farm and the Egyptians\nconcentrating their fire on his men and mine, he could get the pontoon bridge\nthrough. From late afternoon on October 17, his first units began to cross. On\nthe morning of October 18, my battalion joined them. There was still fighting\nahead, and we were part of it: taking out the SAM sites, engaging units of the\nThird Army and, with Sadat now pressing the Americans for a cease-fire and\nmany Egyptian units clearly losing the will to fight on, racing against the clock\nto encircle and defeat it five days later.\n155\nWhen the guns finally fell silent, I had time to give full rein to my thoughts.\nThere were obviously fundamental questions about how the war had happened,\nstarting with why we hadn’t known ahead of time that two neighboring states\nwere about to attack us – despite sayeret intercepts that could have given us\ntime to call up all our reserves. Disentangling the details would take months.\nBut we already knew the human cost of those failures. Hundreds of Israeli\nsoldiers had been killed. The final number would be around 2,800, nearly four\ntimes our losses in 1967. Thousands were wounded, some crippled for life.\nMany of the dead were men whom I’d grown up with or served with, including\nmore than 20 in my own battalion. Some of the dead in other units were close\nfriends.\nI felt exhausted. I also realized that Nava, thousands of miles away in Palo\nAlto, and my parents on the kibbutz could still not be sure I had escaped the fate\nof so many others. I learned later that my parents had been making daily calls to\nDigli, who was working in intelligence in the kirya. Though he had no way of\nknowing where I was, he kept assuring them that he had checked with my\ncommanders and that I was alive and well. Nava had been relying on American\nnews reports and the relayed assurances from my parents, which she was\nseasoned enough as an army wife to treat with skepticism.\nI missed her badly, and little Michal. I felt the need to hear their voices. I\ndrove to one of the brigade communications units. There was a long line in front\nof the radio telephone. But within a half-hour, I managed to get a crackly\nconnection to California. Nava burst into tears when she heard my voice. I told\nher I was fine, and that I couldn’t wait to see her and our little girl. Then, my\nown eyes dampening, I reeled off the names of friends who had died. In\naddition to the brave men I’d lost in my own battalion, there were more than a\ndozen others I already knew of. A pair of brothers from Mishmar Hasharon, a\ncouple of years younger than me, in separate units, but killed within hours of\neach other. Another childhood friend, from a nearby moshav, named Rafi\nMitzafon. And Shaul Shalev, a gifted philosophy postgraduate and a brave tank\ncommander whom I’d become friends with at officers’ school. He’d rescued\nthree dozen troops from one of the Bar-Lev fortifications in the first hours of the\nwar, only to be killed trying to get to a tank crew who had taken refuge a few\nmiles back from the canal.\nI’d lost two wonderful sayeret comrades, too: Amit Ben-Horn, the soldier\nwho’d relayed the order from Motta to abort our second attempt to abduct the\nSyrian officers in Lebanon, and Amitai Nachmani, the officer who had\n156\ndemanded a meeting with Dado before our attack in Rue Verdun. Amit died in\nthe fighting near Ismailia, at the northern end of the canal, as Arik Sharon’s\nunits pushed on after the crossing. The day before the end of the war, both\nAmitai and Amiram Levin were part of an operation to take over the Fayid Air\nBase across the canal. When an Egyptian RPG hit their Jeep, Amiram was\nwounded. Amitai was killed.\nI thought, too, of Yishai Izhar: the friend struck down beside me, who I’d\ncradled in my arms on the top of my tank, trying to stop the bleeding.\n“Oh Ehud,” Nava said. “It’s like 1967 all over again.”\n“No,” I said. “Worse. Much worse.”\nA few weeks later, I was coming out of the kirya when I ran into another\nfriend, whom I’d first met at Hebrew University. Like me, he had been a junior\nofficer in 1967. His name was Ron Ben-Ishai. He would go on to become a top\njournalist, covering the military for Israel’s best-selling newspaper, Yediot\nAchronot. In the early autumn of 1967, we were still transfixed by the idea of\nbeing able to visit areas of biblical Israel, which for years had been under\nJordanian rule. With a few other friends who were young officers, nine of us in\nall, Ron and I embarked on a trek from the southern edge of Jerusalem, weaving\nour way through the Judaean Desert toward Kumeran, on the Dead Sea.\nNow a very different war had come and gone. I’d fought in it. Ron, as what\nis now called an embedded journalist, had been with Danny Matt’s paratroopers\nwhen they’d crossed the canal. He was alongside another of Arik’s units\nfighting out of the bridgehead on the far bank of the canal. That both of us had\nseen terrible suffering over the past few weeks did not need saying. But Ron\nsaid he wanted to show me something. Fishing into his wallet, he took out a\ncarefully folded photograph. He had taken it in 1967, just six years earlier, to\nmark our Judaean trek. There we were. All nine of us. Young. Full of optimism.\nAnd probably a bit full of ourselves as well.\nRon and I were the only two left alive.\n* * *\nWe had won the war, and not just because our forces were now within 60\nmiles of Cairo, and only 25 from Damascus. We had been attacked by two huge\n157\narmies: one-and-a-half million soldiers. Thousands of tanks. Hundreds of\nfighter jets. Other, much larger nations had endured months, even years, of hell\nbefore prevailing in such circumstances: the Soviet Union, for instance, with its\nhuge strategic depth, or France, rescued by its American-led allies, during\nWorld War Two.\nBut any pride in having prevailed was outweighed by simple relief Israel had\nsurvived. Even that was nothing compared to the sadness felt over friends lost,\nand the resentment and sense of betrayal toward the generals and political\nleaders who had failed to prepare the country for the surprise attacks, or the\ninitial confusion and dissension in some of our commanders’ response to the\nearly setbacks on the ground. Dozens of meetings were held in military units\nafter the war to talk about what had gone wrong. I was not the only young\nofficer to notice that the higher up the command chain they went, the more\nunedifying they became. After we’d heard one too many senior officer finetuning\nhis account with each retelling, minimizing his share for the huge losses,\na new phrase entered Israeli army slang. Sipurei kravot – “battle stories” – were\nthe words usually used to describe a normal debriefing process. That expression\nwas now amended, to shipurei kravot. Battle improvements.\nI was assigned to convert my makeshift force into a regular armored training\nunit: Battalion 532, and that slightly delayed my reunion with Nava and Mikhal.\nBut in their absence, I found us a larger apartment in the Tel Aviv suburb of\nRamat Hasharon. Nava and I agreed that at the first opportunity, I’d return to\nCalifornia and we’d fly back together. I went at the end of the year. We bought\na refrigerator and a washing machine for the new flat – better models, and\ncheaper, than those available in Israel – and came home. Those few December\ndays in Palo Alto were a jumble of emotions. Happiness, at being back together.\nBut also a sobering sense, now that I was outside Israel for the first time since\nthe war, of the enormity of the threat we’d faced and the frustration and fear\nNava must have felt as we’d fought to defeat it. The year-end news\nretrospectives we watched on American TV were full of film clips from the first\nhours of the war, when it looked very possible we would lose. I remember being\nstruck by the thought that, if we had lost, if Israel had ceased to exist,\nceremonies of memorial and mourning would have been held across America,\nprobably in Stanford. But that once the shock and sadness had passed, Israel’s\ndisappearance would not have impinged on a single NFL Sunday, or delayed a\nsingle family shopping visit to J. C. Penny.\n158\nMy command of Battalion 532 lasted only a few more months. On April 1,\n1974, an official commission of inquiry published its initial report on the war. It\nwas scathing in its assessment of our intelligence failings, for which it placed\nthe main blame the officer who had been promoted the year before as head of\nmilitary intelligence: Eli Zeira, the man who had addressed us on the sayeret\nbase before the the 1967 and so confidently predicted the outcome. It also took\naim at two other commanders. Gorodish, as head of the southern command, was\none. The other was Dado. As chief-of-staff, he was held ultimately responsible\nfor the intelligence failings and for not having ordered at least a partial call-up\nof our reserves.\nIn Eli’s case, I recognized the very fact of our being caught by surprise made\nhis position untenable. In fact, as I learned more details about what had\nhappened, I realized the commission had, if anything, understated the\nseriousness of his errors. In the run-up to the war, Eli had resisted multiple\nrequests from other intelligence officers to activate what the commission called\nour “special sources” of intelligence: the communications intercepts we’d\nplanted deep inside Egypt. Worse, he had indicated to the few generals who\nwere aware of their existence that he had activated them, implying that his lack\nof concern about the possibility of an Egyptian was based on our intercepts.\nBecause Dado was one of the people misled, his fall struck me as profoundly\nunfair. He had devoted his whole adult life to the defense of our country. After\nthe inquiry report, he was never again the same person. He developed an\nobsession with fitness and exercise. Psychologists might have called it\ndisplacement activity. I wondered whether it was a kind of self-punishment.\nEither way, it may well have killed him. At age 50, less than three years after\nthe war, he died of a heart attack after a day of running and swimming.\nAlmost every level of command was thrown into flux after the inquiry\nreport. So was the political landscape. Both Golda and Dayan bowed to growing\npublic pressure and resigned. The premium was on finding replacements who\nwere sufficiently experienced, but did not bear responsibility for the errors of\nthe war. For Prime Minister, the choice fell on Yitzhak Rabin. He had strong\nmilitary credentials, of course. But he had left the army and entered politics, and\nhad been out of Israel for several years as Israel’s ambassador to Washington.\nHe had joined Golda’s government only weeks before the war, in the relatively\nminor role of Minister of Labor. Much the same thing happened in the army.\nOnly one of the generals who had been in the running to succeed Dado before\n159\nthe war was unscathed: Motta Gur. He, too, had been in Washington. Within\ndays of the inquiry report, he was called back to replace Dado as chief-of-staff.\nMy role changed, too. Not everyone emerged from the war with his\nreputation diminished. The lion’s share of the credit for Israel’s eventual victory\nwent to the rank and file of our citizen army. But in the officers’ corps, there\nwere also examples of coolheadedness in crisis, and leadership. One was\nMoussa Peled, who was now made head of the armored corps. My overall\nwartime commander, Bren, replaced Gorodish as head of the southern\ncommand. And Dan Shomron, whose 401 st armored brigade played a critical\npart in defeating the Egyptians, was another. Dan and I had first got to know\neach other well at Karameh, then during my period as sayeret commander. We\nwould go on in the years ahead to work more closely together than almost any\nsenior officers in the military. He was now promoted as well. He became\nkatzhar, overall head of infantry and paratroop forces, and he recommended me\nas his successor in Brigade 401.\nStill, I knew that the Motta would have the final word, with input from the\ntwo senior officers most directly affected: Peled and Bren. I don’t think either of\nthem had anything against me personally. But both were tank officers through\nand through. There were other candidates to succeed Dan who, unlike me, had\nspent their whole careers in the armored corps.\nI heard formally I was being considered as I was about to return to my\nbattalion from Ramat Hasharon one Sunday morning. I was ordered to report to\nMotta’s office. When I got there, he gestured toward the small table at the side.\nHe already had two other visitors: Moussa Peled and Bren. “You probably\nknow you’re a candidate for taking over 401,” he said. “These two gentlemen\nthink you’re not yet ready. What do you say?”\nIf I’d had more time to prepare, I might have answered more subtly. But I\ndid very much want to be given command of the 401st, and had no doubt I\nwould be a worthy and dedicated commander. “I don’t know exactly what the\ntwo gentlemen mean by whether I’m ready,” I replied. “So I have a proposal.\nFind a battle-tested officer whom you trust. Have him check who among the\nthree of us, me or these gentlemen, is more familiar with the tank and its\nsystems. Who of us knows better the terrain, in Syria or Egypt, day or night,\nwhere we have to fight? Who knows the operational requirements for an\narmored force, and the armored doctrine these gentlemen signed off on. Finally,\nwhich one of us has spent more time in a turret of a tank, on the battlefield,\nshooting at enemy forces and being shot at by the enemy?”\n160\nThere was silence, a grave look from Peled and Bren, the hint of a smile on\nMotta’s face, and the meeting was over. Several days later, I was notified of his\nverdict. I would indeed be named the commander of the 401st Armored Brigade\nin the Sinai, and promoted to full colonel.\nOur base was a 15 miles from the canal. It was a huge expanse of sand\nringed by metal fencing. We spent three months at a time in this forward\ndeployment and three months in our rear base, 50 miles from the canal. During\none of our forward deployments, Motta came on an inspection visit. He wanted\nto discuss how we planned defend the area near the canal in the event of a\nrepeat of the 1973 war. I told him everything we were doing in the brigade was\naimed at ensuring flexibility. I had also been thinking about some of the broader\nissues relating to our defenses in the south. “No matter how good our tactics or\nplans,” I said, “what worries me is that we’re still not looking at our overall\napproach to defense against Egypt. It’s as if we’ve forgotten that in 1967, when\nwe captured Sinai, it was in order to have a buffer zone. We had 150 miles of\nsand between southern Israel and the canal. But when the Egyptians attacked in\n1973, we defended the desert as if it was the walls of Jerusalem!”\nSince the 401st was one of two regular brigades on the Egyptian front, it was\nnot easy to make the four-hour drive home to Ramat Hasharon. When I got\nword Nava was going into labor with our second child, I was leading a training\nexercise five or six miles from our base. As she was on her way to the hospital,\nI grabbed my car and headed north. Unlike Michal’s birth, this one was not\neasy. When the baby emerged, she was struggling to breathe. The immediate\ndanger passed, but she was placed in an incubator. When I got to the hospital,\nNava was asleep. I was taken to see our tiny daughter, Yael. When the nurse\nleft, I noticed the baby’s pinkie trapped in the plastic cover of the incubator. I\nstarted banging on the window of the room. The nurse rushed back. With a look\nof sympathy mixed with world-weary experience of other fathers in similar\npanic, she raised the cover, folded Yael’s tiny hands onto her stomach, and all\nwas well.\nIt was another health crisis which hastened the end of my period as brigade\ncommander. But this time, I was the one in the hospital. I nearly collapsed from\nhigh fever and exhaustion. The initial suspicion was some kind of\ncontamination linked to the rudimentary sanitation in the Sinai. When the\nsymptoms persisted, the doctors suggested I probably had hepatitis B. Years\nlater, better diagnostic tools ruled all that out. I’ve never discovered what the\n161\nillness was. But for nearly six months, getting through the day, sometimes a\nsingle task, remained a struggle.\nI did not want to leave my command. I was still barely 18 months into the\nrole, and anxious to get further command experience. But just as I was feeling at\nmy weakest, there was another belated casualty from the 1973 war. This time, it\nwas Uzi Yairi. No one could reasonably have held him responsible for the\nlosses suffered by Battalion 890 at the Chinese Farm. I’m sure that if he’d\nknown what happened to the Israeli forces that had already tried to take it over,\nhe would never have allowed Yitzhik to go in without adequate armor and\nartillery support. Still, he blamed himself. In obvious distress after the war, he\nwas reassigned as an operational officer in military intelligence in the kirya.\nHe was still at his desk when Fatah terrorists landed on Tel Aviv’s seafront a\nlittle before midnight on March 4, 1975. They were spotted by a police patrol,\nwhich opened fire. The Fatah men ran from the beach, firing Kalashnikovs and\ntossing grenades. A block in from the sea, they burst into a modest, three-story\nbuilding: the old Savoy Hotel. They shot and killed three people in the lobby\nand took the rest of the staff and guests hostage.\nSayeret Matkal was called in. As the unit went through final preparations for\ntheir assault, Uzi showed up. He had a rifle. He was in his everyday officer’s\nuniform, unlike the sayeret team, which was weighted down by special-forces\ngear. As a former commander of the sayeret, he persuaded them he could help\ntake out the terrorists and locate the hostages. Shortly before dawn, led by\nAmiram Levin, they attacked. They killed three of the Fatah men within\nseconds. But another terrorist set off an explosion, collapsing most of the top\nfloor. Uzi joined a couple of the other sayeret men in search of the hostages. He\nwas shot in the head and neck. Seven of the eight terrorists were killed, the\nother captured. Though five hostages were freed, five lost their lives. Uzi died\non the operating table of Ichilov Hospital, a few hundred yards from the kirya.\n* * *\nThough I doubt Uzi’s family and friends would agree, my gut feeling was\nalways that his death was one more result, however indirect, of the shambolic\nway in which we’d organized our attacks on the Chinese Farm. That was part of\nthe reason for my reluctance when Motta told me he wanted me to take Uzi’s\n162\nplace in the kirya. I realized I was the only available replacement with a similar\nbackground, and sayeret experience. But I was still gaining brigade command\nexperience. And I couldn’t help feeling the role was intended as a kind of restand-recovery\ncure because of my illness, not too different from the reason Uzi\nhad been given the job. Still, I did need rest and recovery. Even if fully healthy,\nI’m not sure I could have convinced Motta to change his mind. In my weakened\nstate, I had no chance.\nSkeptical though I was about the job, it opened up a new world to me. The\nkirya itself was not new territory. But now, I became exposed to how how the\nhuge range of intelligence information we gathered was collated, evaluated,\nassessed and ultimately applied. Helping with this process was my new\nassignment. There were, in fact, two of us. We were both colonels and together\nwe provided the intelligence background for military operations. I had the post\non inside the military intelligence department. My opposite number was in the\noperations department – the more senior role, in a way, because he had a more\ndirect link to the people actually doing the operations. He was a friend from\nofficers’ school: Dovik Tamari’s younger brother, Shai. Once a week, Shai and\nI put together an assessment report. Then, we’d join Motta’s operations meeting\nwith the general staff, often attended by the man who’d followed Dayan as\ndefense minister, Shimon Peres.\nThe analysis of military intelligence included separate teams for Egypt and\nSyria, Jordan and Lebanon, Iraq and other neighboring states, as well as other\ncountries and superpower relations. It relied on all our raw intelligence material,\nfrom both military intelligence and Mossad, as well as academic and specialist\nliterature. Each desk dealt not just with military issues, but political and\neconomic developments. I was responsible, along with Shai and a few others,\nfor bringing all this together. This meant frequent meetings with members of the\nanalysis teams. For the first six months or so, I barely uttered a word in these\nsessions. I listened, not just absorbing the information but getting to understand\nthe way the analysts worked and thought.\nOur whole intelligence department was responsible for drafting an annual\nstrategic assessment for the army and the government. The final report was\nwritten by Shlomo Gazit, who had succeeded Eli Zeira as head of military\nintelligence. Before we sent it to print, he held a long meeting, inviting the\nviews of all the military intelligence officers. The focus in 1976, just three years\nafter the war, was on the risks of a new surprise attack. At the end of the\ndiscussion, however, he said: “We know we run a real danger for the country if\n163\nwe fail to spot the signs of a war. But has any of you asked yourselves\nsomething I find myself wondering from time to time? Is there not a similar risk\nif we miss the signs of an opportunity for peace?”\nHis words stuck with me for the rest of my time in public life. They also had\na strong impact on me at the time. One of the benefits of my job was that I\ncould read the full inquiry report from the 1973 war, including the portions that\nhad been kept classified. Some dealt with the political situation before the war.\nGolda had relied heavily on a “kitchen cabinet” of trusted ministers and a few\nclose advisers. The inquiry material described how Sadat had been extending\nnegotiating feelers before the war. And how Golda, Eli Zeira, Dado and Dayan\nhad responded. It was like an exercise in collective reinforcement. They agreed\nthe Arab countries would not simply go on living with the humiliation of their\ndefeat in 1967. At some stage, they would try to regain the initiative, on the\nbattlefield. But none appeared to think through the implications of this for our\npolitical approach. Perhaps, like Eli Zeira in 1967, they assumed a kind of\nhistorical inevitability of Israeli triumph. Though we’d ending up prevailing in\n1973, it was impossible not to wonder whether, as Shlomo suggested, we had\nmissed the signs of a possible peace beforehand.\nNow, however, we were facing an escalating challenge from an enemy with\nno interest in peace: the armed Palestinian groups. The Democratic Front took\nover a school in northern Israel a half-year after the war. In March 1975, Fatah\nhad seized the Savoy. And about a year into my posting in the kirya, the Popular\nFront for the Liberation of Palestine launched an even more audacious\noperation.\nIt became known by the name of the airport where the ordeal ended.\nEntebbe. And when it began I, like Uzi Yairi, was sitting at my desk.\n164\nChapter Ten\nSunday is an ordinary working day in Israel, and the first sign that June 27,\n1976 would be any different came shortly after noon. It was an urgent message\nfrom Lod Airport, now renamed in honor of David Ben-Gurion, who passed\naway after the 1973 war. Radio contact had been lost with Air France Flight 139\nfrom Tel Aviv to Paris, shortly after a stopover in Athens.\nWe couldn’t know for sure what had gone wrong. Maybe a mechanical\nmalfunction, a glitch in the electronics, a crash. Or a hijack. But we did know\nthere were roughly 300 passengers and a dozen crew on board. Many of the\npassengers were Israelis, and others were Jews from abroad. Ever since the\nSabena hijacking four years earlier, whenever a civilian airliner was thought to\nbe under attack within three hours of Israel, step-one in our response had been\nautomatic. Sayeret Matkal was ordered to the airport.\nBecause I’d commanded the Sabena operation – the first, and still the only,\ntime we had attacked and freed a hijacked plane – it was probably inevitable I\nwould take some part in figuring out how, or whether, to intervene if the Air\nFrance plane turned out to have been hijacked. But my pivotal role, as the crisis\nintensified, was down to a combination of factors: my broader experience as\nsayeret commander, the fact that I now worked in the kirya, just one floor up\nfrom the chief of staff, and, as so often, pure chance.\nAs the sayeret assembled at the airport, its current commander –Yoni\nNetanyahu, my former deputy – was hundreds of miles away in the Sinai,\npreparing for an operation across the canal. So it was Mookie Betzer, now\nYoni’s deputy, who began briefing the men for a possible hostage rescue in case\nthe jet returned to Israel. At the kirya, we were also without our commander:\nMotta was in the Negev observing a major military exercise. So it was his\ndeputy – the head of the operations branch, Kuti Adam – who buzzed me on the\nintercom at two in the afternoon and summoned me to his office.\nBy now, we knew the plane had been hijacked, but that it wasn’t heading\nback to Israel. The terrorists had renamed it “Arafat” and it was on its way to\nLibya. I took the stairs down to Kuti’s office, two floors below mine, and he\nimmediately handed me a large, black-and-white aerial photo. It showed the\ninternational airport in Benina, just outside Benghazi on the eastern edge of\nLibya. “Can we do anything, Ehud?” he asked me. I didn’t say no outright. But\nI told him that even if we had a treasure trove of intelligence about Benina –\n165\nwhich, I soon verified, we didn’t – the obstacles would be enormous. Unlike the\nSabena jet, this one was a wide-bodied Airbus, and El Al had none of those in\nits fleet. Even we could find a way to make sure a sayeret team got briefed on\nthe airliner, we’d be mounting an attack-and-rescue operation a thousand miles\naway. And even if we could take out the terrorists, we were almost certain to\nface opposition from the former army colonel who ruled Libya, Mummer\nGhaddafy. The chance of success seemed slim, the risks enormous.\nSoon, however, Kuti’s question ceased to matter. Later Sunday night, Flight\n139 took off again. Before leaving Libya, the hijackers freed a passenger: an\nIsraeli dual national, with a British passport as well, who managed to convince\nthem she was going into labor. We learned through her that there were four\nhijackers: two Arabs and two Europeans. It was a PFLP operation, but included\nmembers of the far-left West German Baader-Meinhof terror group. They\nforced the pilot to head for the east African state of Uganda. On Monday\nevening, it landed at Entebbe Airport, 20 miles outside the Ugandan capital of\nKampala and just a couple of hundred yards from the shore of Lake Victoria. It\nwas five times further away than Benghazi.\nYet with each passing hour, increasingly alarming radio and television\nreports focused on the obvious agony of the hundreds of captive passengers. To\nthis day, I’ve never been able to establish why it was a further 24 hours before\nwe started seriously to work out if there might be some way for us to free them.\nPrime Minister Rabin was clearly asking himself the same question, however,\nbecause on Tuesday afternoon, he called Motta in the Negev. It was now a full\n53 hours after the hijacking, he said. What the hell we were doing to try to come\nup with a plan? Motta was immediately summoned back to Jerusalem for an\nemergency meeting of the government. As he was on his way back from there\nto the kirya, Kuti called me back down to his office. “Motta just told them that\nthere is a military option,” he said, with a wry smile. Kuti had been a Haganah\nofficer in 1948, in charge of the Golani brigade, head of both the northern and\nthe southern command, and had known Motta for years. “That means we now\nhave to find one.”\nI had just begun briefing a few of the analysts in my office when Motta\nreturned. When I got to his office, Kuti waved both of us across the hallway to\nthe big, rectangular conference room where general staff meetings were held.\nOn the side of the room was a globe. Giving it a spin, he said: “Nu, Motta. Tell\nme, when you told the government we had a military option, did you even know\nwhere Entebbe is?” Motta didn’t so much as crack a smile. “We have to find a\n166\nresponse,” he said. “I’ve committed us. Ehud, I want you to check what can be\ndone. Take whatever you need, from wherever you want. Bring me suggestions\nby seven tomorrow morning.” Then, he said, we would go brief the Defense\nMinister, Shimon Peres.\nI assembled a team the same way we’d prepared for special-operations\nmissions in the sayeret: looking for information, intelligence and above all\nexperience and insight from whoever I thought was likely to make that alwaysnarrow\ndifference between failure and success. My first calls went to Mookie\nBetzer and another of my most trusted and experienced sayeret comrades,\nAmiram Levin. Then I brought in Ido Ambar, the personal aide to air force\ncommander Benny Peled, and Gadi Shefi, the commander of the Shayetet 13\nSEALs. Finally, two officers from Dan Shomron’s office. Since Dan was\nkatzhar, in overall command of paratroop and infantry forces, it was critical to\nkeep him in the picture. I told them all that we’d be working through the night,\nand that I had to be able to tell Motta and Shimon by the morning whether we\nreally could mount a rescue mission.\nI still thought I’d end up having to tell them no. However difficult the\nobstacles we’d faced with Sabena, they were almost child’s play compared to\ngetting a sayeret assault team 5,000 miles across the continent of Africa,\nsurprising the terrorists, freeing the hostages unharmed and getting them out.\nThat was even assuming, as I did at that point, that we wouldn’t face armed\nopposition from the troops of Uganda’s increasingly tyrannical president, Idi\nAmin. Amin had begun to align himself politically with the Palestinians in the\npast few years – one reason, no doubt, the terrorists had landed there. But he\nhad actually been on a paratroop course in Israel before taking power in 1971.\nWe had sent officers to help train his army in the early 1970s.\nNow, I discovered, Mookie himself had been on one of the training missions.\n“Their men aren’t great fighters, at least at night,” he said, an insight of obvious\nrelevance to planning a commando attack, if we could get that far. When\nAmbar, the air force aide, spoke up, I finally began to feel we might at least be\nable to put together the outline of a plan. He’d brought with him a copy of the\nstandard reference book on world airports, which gave us at least a general idea\nof the layout of Entebbe. He also said that the air force had run a training\nprogram for the Ugandans. In Entebbe. He’d contacted one of the reserve pilots\nwho had been on the training mission, and he was on his way to join us.\nStill, time was short we were nowhere near being able to recommend a\nspecific plan of action. The hijackers had set a deadline – noon on Thursday,\n167\nJuly 1, now less than 36 hours away. Having moved the passengers off the plane\nto one of the terminal buildings, they were threatening to start killing them\nunless we freed a list of 53 Palestinians and PLO supporters, forty of them held\nin Israel and the rest in a number of European countries, and paid a ransom of\nfive million dollars.\nWell past midnight, we started looking at our options. One which seemed –\nbriefly – to hold promise drew on suggestions from Ido Ambar and Mookie.\nIdo’s almost rhapsodic description of the capabilities of our C-130 Hercules\ntransport planes convinced us we could parachute in a Sayeret Matkal team, as\nwell as vehicles for them to use on the ground. Mookie and I agreed that to\nensure surprise, we would disguise the commandos as Ugandan troops, in\n“Ugandan” Jeeps. The final twist came with the arrival of the reserve air force\nofficer who had been on training duty in Entebbe. He brought a reel of 8mm\nfilm from an official ceremony at the airport. At the start, a Ugandan army\ngeneral could be seen arriving in a black Mercedes. “That’s it!” Mookie said.\n“The Mercedes. Every top Ugandan military officer has one.” We decided to\nswap one of our Jeeps for a jet-black limousine.\nYet by daybreak on Wednesday, when I went up to brief Motto, we’d set\naside the option of a parachute drop. Any initial surprise would be outweighed\nby the risk of exposure from the very start of the assault. We’d also gone cold\non a second option, to infiltrate sayeret teams along the shore of Lake Victoria\nfrom across the nearby border in Kenya. I doubted we had enough time to\nnavigate all the operational and diplomatic obstacles before the deadline\nexpired. That left option three: having the SEALs, along with a core team from\nthe sayeret, parachute onto Lake Victoria with rubber dinghies and attack the\nairport from on foot. We arranged to do a test parachute assault off the Israeli\ncoast in Haifa later in the day, but if that went well, it seemed the only practical\nalternative.\nMotta and I went met Peres around 8:30am. Shimon had no first-hand\nmilitary experience, having played a political role alongside Ben-Gurion from\nIsrael’s early years. So he was not really interested in the details. But he was\nkeen to hear our assurances that a military option did exist. He was even more\nintrigued when we were joined by the head of the air force, Benny Peled.\nUnaware of the airborne parachute drop we had been discussing overnight,\nPeled suggested something far more ambitious. Rather than using a single\nHercules, he proposed using four of the giant transport planes to ferry in a larger\nforce, some 200 men in all, land them on one of the runways and take over the\n168\nentire airport. Though I didn’t say so, I had my doubts it would work. It was a\nbit like the initial option for the Rue Verdun raid Dado had rejected: a classic\nground assault which, in addition to eliminating any chance of surprise,\nobviously ran the risk of igniting a small ground war. But I did think that some\ncombination of Peled’s idea and the surprise commando strike we’d been\nlooking at might provide an answer.\nA few hours later, the hostages’ ordeal took a chilling turn, which soon also\nprovided us with our first real detailed picture of the scale of the challenge we\nfaced. In a haunting echo of the Nazis’ “selection” process in the Holocaust, the\nterrorists separated all the passengers with Israeli passports or Jewish names.\nThey let the rest of them go, and allowed them to board a special Air France\nflight back to Paris. We immediately dispatched Amiram Levin to debrief the\nfreed passengers. On a scrambled teleprinter line Wednesday night, Amiram\ncame up with far more than we could have hoped for. One of released\npassengers was a French woman who had managed to hide the fact she was\nJewish. She confirmed reports we had been getting that the hostages were being\nheld in the airport’s former terminal building, about a mile from its newer\nterminal and the main runways. Other passengers revealed that the hijackers had\nplaced explosives around the old terminal building. And that, despite my hope\nthat Idi Amin would stand aside if we did decide to go in and rescue the\nhostages, his troops were helping to guard the area.\nSo in addition to taking on the hijackers, we’d have to find a way to deal\nwith Ugandan soldiers. In another round of discussions in my office through the\nlate hours of Wednesday night, we finally settled on our plan: Peled’s major\nairborne operation, but with a Sayeret Matkal strike force, with its “Ugandan”\nmotorcade, spearheading it. Minutes later, three other C-130s would fly in\nadditional troops to secure the rest of the airport, deal with any Ugandan army\nresistance, and fly out the Israeli soldiers and the hostages.\nAn operation on that scale naturally meant bringing in Dan Shomron. After\nI’d taken the plan to Kuti Adam, he briefed Dan on the full detail and called me\ndown to see him again. Dan had left to start preparations for the operation. He’d\nmade just one request, Kuti said: that I be in command of the sayeret force.\n* * *\n169\nI could see why Dan had said it. Working with Mookie and the rest of my\nteam, I’d been in charge of all the initial planning. I was in command of the\nSabena assault, the only remotely similar operation Israel had attempted.\nThough an attempt to rescue dozens of terrified hostages in Entebbe, with both\nthe terrorists and possibly Ugandan soldiers armed and ready, would be much\nharder. As Sayeret Matkal commander, I’d conceived and commanded other\nmissions that requiring us to break new ground. But – and it was a huge but – I\nknew from the moment I left Kuti’s office that I would have to find a way to\navoid undermining the current sayeret commander, Yoni. Dan had clearly been\naware of that as well. He’d stressed to Kuti that he meant no disrespect to Yoni.\n“But I know Ehud,” he said. “I’ve worked with him. I want him to lead it.”\nYoni was still in the Sinai. I’d phoned him before our first overnight\nplanning session to tell him I was bringing in Mookie and Amiram. Mookie had\nbeen giving him daily updates. But the clock was ticking. Under the initial\ndeadline, the hijackers had threatened to begin “executions” on Thursday.\nToday. The deadline had now been pushed back, but only until Sunday morning\n– and only after Rabin felt he had no option but to drop our public refusal to\nconsider negotiating with them.\nWhen Dan called our first operational briefing for Thursday night, Mookie\nsent a plane to bring Yoni back. Dan set out the plan with his customary\nconfidence. The four Hercules would take off on Saturday evening from Sharm\nel-Sheikh at the southernmost tip of the Sinai, to cut the flying distance at least\nslightly. The first plane would land on the runway near the new terminal. Inside\nwould be a small unit of paratroopers, the sayeret strike force, a pair of Jeeps\nand the Mercedes. The next Hercules wouldn’t arrive for another seven minutes:\nthe most critical minutes of the whole operation. That was when our “Ugandan\nmotorcade” would make its way to the old terminal, burst in and take care of the\nterrorists. The second Hercules would include another Sayeret Matkal team, to\nreinforce the attack unit and secure the perimeter of the old terminal. Hercules\nNumber Three, a minute later, would carry a joint force of sayeret fighters,\nparatroopers and a Golani team. Their job would be to take over the new\nterminal and the rest of the airport and deal with any Ugandan army resistance.\nThe final plane was a flying medical unit, to provide treatment for the hostages\nand carry them back to Israel.\nYoni arrived just as Dan was finishing his presentation. He looked focused,\nenergized, and eager to play his part. I realized it was important to explain to\nhim the decision to place me in command. Despite our close relationship, I\n170\nknew that would be a sensitive task. We spoke only briefly before he and\nMookie drove back to the sayeret base to begin more detailed preparations.\nYoni was insistent that he should be in charge. I told him I understood, and I\ndid. In his position, I would have felt exactly the same way. But for a variety of\nreasons, Dan wanted me in command. Still, I stressed my determination not to\ndetract from his authority. Yoni would lead in the main assault unit. He and\nMookie would choose the other officers and soldiers, decide their roles and take\ncharge of training, briefing and logistics. I could tell he was still not satisfied.\nBut I told him and Mookie I’d join them later that night. We could talk further,\nahead of the next full briefing, which Dan had set for nine o’clock on Friday\nmorning on the sayeret base.\nWhen they left, I joined Dan, Motta and Kuti to go see Rabin. Shimon Peres\nwas there too. He would later say that, as Defence Minister, he was a crucial\nvoice in pressing to go ahead with the rescue mission. He’s right, and had he\nbeen sceptical, or opposed the idea of a recuse, it would have made things much\nmore difficult. But his position was far easier than the Prime Minister’s. He\nlacked Rabin’s hands-on command experience, his grasp of the details of what\nwe were proposing to do and the obvious risks. All Israelis were aware of this. I\nthe operation failed, or if we decided in the end not to attempt it, it would be\nRabin who would bear the responsibility and get the blame.\nEven under the best of circumstances, Rabin was naturally cautious – the\nflipside of the meticulousness with which he ran through the fine detail of every\nmilitary mission. As I remembered from when he was chief of staff, in our\nslightly surreal conversation about the danger of a booby-trapped\ncommunications intercept exploding as I defused it, he would focus on\neverything that might conceivably go wrong with an operation before approving\nit. Now, he was also under huge additional pressure. From the start of the hijack\ncrisis, there had been calls from the hostages’ families to do something to end\nthe ordeal. But as I later discovered, one of the leading scientific engineers in\nIsrael, Yosef Tulipman, had a daughter among the passengers. Like Yitzhak, he\nhad been a Palmachnik. He’d come to see the Prime Minister and implored him\nnot to attempt an operation that might endager her or the others. “I demand one\nthing only,” he said. “Don’t go on any adventures. Do not play with the lives of\nthese people, with the life of my daughter.”\nAfter Entebbe, there would be suggestions that Rabin’s readiness to\nnegotiate with the terrorists had been a ploy, designed to buy time. Yet his\nmessage to us that night was that if there was a military option with a\n171\nreasonable chance of success, he would approve it. But otherwise, we could not\nlet dozens of hostages be murdered if by talking, even deal-making, we could\nhave saved them. He turned to Dan and asked whether there indeed was a\nmilitary option with a reasonable prospect of getting the hostages out. Dan said\nyes. Rabin turned to me next. I agreed: we had a plan, and we felt we could\nmake it work. Motta was a bit more hesitant. He suggested we couldn’t know\nfor sure until we’d finished testing key parts of the operation. But for Rabin, it\nseemed to me Dan’s was the key voice. So he told us that he was approving it.\nIn principle.\nHe said he still needed answers to two questions. The first was whether it\nwas physically possible to cross from the new terminal area, where we’d be\nlanding, to the old terminal buidling. He was right to press us. If a retaining wall\nor a drainage trench had been added druing the modernization work on the\nairport, any element of surprise could be lost. Rabin’s second condition was that\nwe find a way to make absolutely sure, by the time the first Hercules landed,\nthat the hostages were still in the old terminal building. I knew why that\ntroubled him, from a remark I’d heard him make a few years earlier when\ndescribing an American hostage-rescue raid behind enemy lines in North\nVietnam. That operation went exactly as planned. Except that the POWs had\nbeen moved.\nI drove to see Yoni and Mookie at the sayeret base. We spent most of the\nmeeting on the opening few minutes of the operation: the rolling out of the\nvehicles, the drive to the old terminal, and how to handle the possibility that we\nmight meet Ugandan resistance. Mookie remained adamant about the\nUgandans, from his time training them a few years earlier. Even if we did run\ninto a group of Amin’s troops, even if they were armed, even if they were\npointing their guns at us, even if they shout at us to stop, they “wouldn’t dare\nopen fire on a Mercedes.” I trusted his experience. I kept emphasizing that we\nhad to go in with the mindset of not engaging Ugandan troops unless there was\nno choice. If we did need to do so, we would use only small, silenced Berettas –\nsince I’d made sure the unit trained on the Berettas after Sabena.\nI also raised another critical condition for success. “There will definitely be\nan armed presence in the control tower,” I said. We needed to designate a\nspecial unit whose sole job would be to train machine guns, rifles and grenadelaunchers\non the tower as soon as we got off the Hercules. “The moment that we\nlose the element of surprise, they open fire.”\n172\nDan began the next morning’s briefing with a stage-by-stage review of how\nthe operation would unfold. But just as he was getting to the detail of the\nmotorcade attack, I felt a young sayeret officer tap me on the shoulder. Kuti had\nphoned to say I was to go see him at the kirya. “He said immediately,” the\nofficer added, “and not to discuss it with anyone. Just to tell Dan Shomron that\nyou’ve been taken out of the operation.”\n* * *\nTo say I was surprised would be an understatement. But I allowed myself to\nbelieve the decision to “take me out” could still be reversed. Not only was I\nready to command the critical first part of the operation. I believed I was best\nplaced to ensure it succeeded. I felt that was best for Yoni, too, due to tensions\ninside the sayeret of which both of us were aware.\nThere was no officer to whom I was closer than Yoni. He had extraordinary\nstrengths as a soldier: in the Six-Day War, in 1973, and afterwards when, with\nmy encouragement, he’d taken command of a tank battalion in the north left\nalmost in tatters from the Yom Kippur War. But there was more to him as well.\nI used to marvel how at the end of 16 hours of sayeret training, he could spend a\nfurther two or three reading history, or a novel or poetry. He always struggled\nbetween the impulse to devote his life to fighting for the State of Israel, and to\nstudying, reading and living as a more “normal” family man.\nHis drive to serve, and to excel, was stronger. Tuti Goodman, the young\nwoman he’d met as a teenager and married, understood what drew him to a life\nin uniform. But that wasn’t what she had signed up for. At one point, Yoni\nasked me to speak to Tuti. She asked me to speak to him. I did my best to\nexplain each to the other. But the gap between what each of them wanted for\ntheir lives was just too wide. Before the 1973 war, they’d separated. After the\nwar, professionally fulfilled but personally shattered, Yoni heard that I’d found\nan apartment in Ramat Hasharon, and he asked me if there were other flats in\nthe building. It turned out that the owner of the flat below ours was willing to\nrent it. Yoni snapped it up.\nOver the past year or so, with Yoni leading the sayeret and me in the kirya,\nwe’d seen more of each another. For the first time in years, he seemed to have\nfound a sense of peace, and fulfillment, in his personal life. That was in large\n173\npart because of Bruria Shaked, his girlfriend, whom he’d met while\ncommanding the tank unit after 1973. While he was a thinker and a brooder and\nin many ways a loner, Bruria was outgoing, playful, funny and full of life. She\nsensed his need for a shoulder to lean on, a hand to hold at the movies or on a\nSaturday stroll on the beach. They made their apartment a home. The shelves\ncreaked under the weight of Yoni’s books. Often on a Saturday, when Nava and\nI dropped in to see them, an old 33 rpm record would be playing on the stereo.\nYoni would be sitting puffing on his pipe, reading, and smiling.\nBut outside this domestic haven, he still struggled. He had looked forward to\ncommanding Sayeret Matkal. But there was a growing distance between him\nand those he led, a kind of dissonance between these more typically Israeli\nyoungsters and the aloof, reflective, intellectual side of their commander. There\nwas another tension as well. Sayeret training was notoriously tough. Yoni\nearned the admiration of his men by participating personally in the most\ndifficult of the exercises. But just as he pushed himself to his limits, he insisted\nrelentlessly on seeing the same drive in them. This was a challenge all sayeret\ncommanders faced to some extent. I had, too. But a number of the officers had\ngone to the kirya to urge that Yoni be replaced. He knew this. Though I tried to\nreassure him, telling him that every sayeret commander was different, with his\nown strengths and weaknesses, he became only more determined to push\nhimself and those around him harder.\nNo we were in the final countdown for Entebbe. It was a life-or-death\nmission not just for us, but the hostages, an operation in which even a second’s\nhesitation or tension or uncertainty could prove fatal. I was worried that the\nrumblings of uneasiness in the unit might prove an additional obstacle that\nwasn’t worth the risk.\nWhen I tried to persuade Kuti to stick with the original plan, however, he\nwas insistent. He told me to get ready to fly not into Uganda, but to Nairobi. I’d\nbeen re-assigned to accompany a Mossad team to Kenya. Our first task would\nbe to get the answers to the questions Rabin had asked us. Then, we would be in\ncharge of arranging for the Kenyans to allow us to refuel the C-130s on the way\nout, and to set up a medical facility for any injured soldiers or hostages. During\nthe attempted rescue, I would also be the channel of communications from the\nNairobi side of the operation to Kuti, tens of thousands of feet above Entebbe in\na command 707. Dan, as overall commander, would be in charge on the ground.\n174\n* * *\nThe Kenyans were not exactly allies of Israel. But relations between\nPresident Jomo Kenyatta’s security services and Mossad had been close for\nsome years. I flew in with three leading Mossad men. While one of them called\non the aging President Kenyatta, our main point of contact, was the head of\nKenya’s security services. Since the secrecy of the mission had to be preserved,\nwe couldn’t make advance preparations for refueling or the additional 707\nwhich we intended to fly in as a field hospital. But he smoothed the way for us\nto do both, without anyone asking too many questions.\nThe Mossad men took the lead in arranging to get Rabin’s questions\nanswered. They contacted a pilot they knew. The pilot flew to Entebbe early on\nSaturday morning, circled, and, after he was cleared to land, claimed\nmechanical difficulties and flew out again. I had his telephoto pictures by midmorning\nand phoned Rabin’s intelligence officer to let him know we’d\nconfirmed there was a clear path to the old terminal. We still had to make sure\nthe captive passengers were there, however. A nurse from Kampala who had\nbeen allowed to visit them made three further visits: late Saturday afternoon,\nthen shortly after the first Hercules had taken off from Sharm al-Sheikh, and\nfinally around nine at night. I was able to reassure Rabin that the question to his\nsecond question was also “yes”. Although all of the C-130s were already\nairborne, it was only then that he gave the mission the final go-ahead.\nAs commander of Sayeret Matkal, I’d always found running an operation\nfrom a command post hugely frustrating. This was even worse. Once we got\nword the Israeli force was on the way to Uganda, we put in place the\narrangements for refueling. If all went well, the first C-130, with Yoni’s assault\nteam and at least some of the hostages, was due to reach Entebbe and begin the\nassault at midnight Saturday. Assuming there were no major problems, it would\ntake an hour at most. All I could do now, from 300 miles away, was wait.\nShortly after midnight, Kuti radioed me with a terse message: the first of the\nHercules had left Entebbe for Nairobi, and the command plane was returning to\nIsrael. About quarter to one in the morning on July 4, the transport planes began\ntheir staggered arrival. When the first Hercules taxied to a halt, I went out to\nmeet it. As its giant rear door lowered, Dan was the first person I saw. I could\ntell from the awkward silence, the lack of any greeting, something must have\n175\ngone wrong. “Ehud,” he said finally, “Yoni’s dead. We got the hostages out.\nBut Yoni was killed.”\nI sought out two other friends: Mookie and Ephraim Sneh, the Battalion 890\ndoctor, who had been with us at the Chinese Farm. Both were obviously torn\nbetween a sense of accomplishment in having freed the hostages and the blow\nof losing Yoni. I asked Ephraim to take me to the front of the plane’s huge belly\nto see him. He was on a stretcher, covered with a blanket. I peeled it back.\nYoni’s face had lost all color. But when I touched his forehead, it seemed\nslighty warm, almost as if there was still a spark of life inside him.\nI couldn’t raise Kuti by radio, so I used the landline in the airport director’s\noffice to phone Motta.\n“Yoni is dead,” I told him.\n“Are you sure?” he asked. I said: “Yes. I’ve seen him.”\nBefore the transport planes began leaving for Israel, I made another call. It\nwas to Nava. She was asleep. I told her that the operation to free the hostages\nhad succeeded. “But Yoni has been killed.” I could hear her gasp. “Listen,” I\nsaid, “you have to go downstairs. Tell Bruria. Before some army officer shows\nup at her door. Or worse, because they’re not married, no one may come and\nshe’ll hear it on the radio. Go. Tell her. Stay with her.” At first, she seemed not\nso much unwilling as unable to do it. “What can I say?” I said I knew how hard\nit would be, but that she needed to make sure Bruria heard the news from a\nfriend. Later, Nava told me she’d waited until daybreak, not wanting to make\nthings worse by waking her. Then, she went downstairs. She told Bruria what\nhad happened, stayed with her, talked with her, and held her, during those first\nfew awful hours.\nI found Yoni’s death even more upsetting when I learned from Mookie and\nothers how it had happened. As the sayeret motorcade began making its way\nfrom the Hercules to the terminal, with Mookie and Yoni in the Mercedes, two\nUgandan soldiers had seen them. One of the Ugandans raised his rifle. Rather\nthan relying on Mookie’s assurances the soldier wouldn’t actually fire, Yoni and\nanother soldier shot him with their silenced Berettas. But they’d only wounded\nhim. In case he managed to fire back, another soldier in the Jeep behind them\nkilled him, with his un-silenced machine gun.\nNow that all surprise was gone, the commandos abandoned their vehicles\nand began sprinting towards the old terminal. Only seconds later, still 80 yards\n176\nor so from the terminal, Yoni was hit. He’d been shot from the control tower. I\nrealized that unexpected setbacks or slip-ups were inevitable in any operation.\nBut the crucial first stage of the attack had not only gone wrong. It had gone\nwrong in exacrly the way that we had first discussed back at the sayeret base,\nand now Yoni was dead because of it.\nI had to remain in Kenya for a few more days. Though we’d rescued 102\npassengers and crew, three of the hostages had been killed in the crossfire.\nWhile most of the injuries to the others were minor, we arranged to have several\nof the more seriously wounded taken to a Nairobi hospital. So I was unable to\njoin the gathering of hundreds on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem for Yoni’s funeral.\nOr to hear Shimon Peres praise him in terms I knew must have filled his parents\nand Bibi, too, with enormous pride. Shimon described him as “one of Israel’s\nfinest sons, one of its most courageous warriors, one of its most promising\ncommanders.”\nThe first evening I was back, however, I visited the Netanyahus at their\nfamily home in Jerusalem: Ben-Zion and Tzila, the parents; Ido, the youngest of\nthe three children, and Bibi, who was still at MIT. It was a few nights in the\nshivah, the seven days of mourning, and there were dozens of other wellwishers\nthere as well. I spoke to Bibi first, outwardly strong but I sensed still\noverwhelmed by their loss. Hugging him, I said the weeks ahead would be\ntough, not just because of Yoni’s death, but because much of the responsibility\nof providing emotional support for his parents, both in their sixties, would fall\non his 26-year-old shoulders. This was the first time I’d met the father, Ben-\nZion, face to face, but I was struck by how this balding, professorial figure\nseemed able to keep inside the pain and loss he must have been feeling. He did\nclearly know of me, both from Bibi and from the frequent letters always wrote\nto him at Cornell. Now, after I’d said what I could to comfort him, he asked\nwhether we could meet again. When we did, a few days later, he was clearly\nconscious of the his late, lost son’s bourgeoning place in Israel’s pantheon of\nnational heros. He asked me to be one of the speakers at Yoni’s shloshim, a\ncommemorative event in Jerusalem which, in Jewish religious tradition, would\nmark the end of the first month of mourning. “You knew him well,” he said, and\nproceeded to stress the importance of using my remarks to explain, and\nelaborate on, Yoni’s powerful accomplishments and personal legacy.\nI thought about what he wanted, and about Yoni himself, in the days ahead.\nAbout the tragedy of his death, but also the way in which all of us now had to\ndraw meaning, value, and ideally something of permanence from the feelings of\n177\nloss. As I prepared my notes, I also spent time working out how to square what I\nfelt I needed to say, with what many in the audience, and certainly Ben-Zion\nand Bibi, would expect me to say. Not only was Yoni being mourned across\nIsrael after Entebbe. He was being elevated – in the spirit of Shimon’s words at\nthe funeral –to something approaching sainthood. I did not want to detract from\nhis evolving status as national hero, or his importance as a symbol of a\ncommando success which had, for the first time since the 1973 war, restored a\nmeasure of Israeli sense of self-confidence. A victory, over all logic and all\nodds. But I also wanted to find a way of capturing Yoni as he really was: a\nbrave man, an extraordinary fighter and officer. But also a man sometimes\nfeeling torn inside, and alone.\nI began with words of ancient rabbinic wisdom about the path which all of us\ntravel from birth to death, and to whatever comes after. The quotation I chose –\nfrom the 2,000-year-old volume known as Pirkei Avot, the Ethics of our Fathers\n– seemed right to me. “Know where you came from: a putrid drop... Know\nwhere you are going: to a place of dust, maggots and worms... And know before\nwhom you are destined to give your final account, the King of Kings.” I spoke\nof the loss of Yoni, and said it was impossible not to think about the meaning of\nwhat lay between the “putrid drop” where each of us begins our life and our\nfinal reckoning. “I believe that life is not just a sum of the hours and days\nbetween the beginning and the end. It is the content we pour into the space in\nbetween,” I said. I’d known people who were given the gift of a long life but\nwho, by that definition, had hardly lived at all. There were also people like\nYoni. He’d lived only briefly. But he had learned and loved. Fought and trained\nothers to fight. Grappled with the most profound puzzles of existence, and yet\nremained open “to the wonders of a smile. A journey. A flower. A poem.” If\nthere was any consolation for a life ended cut off at age 30, I said, that was it.\nBut I wanted to give a more personal, nuanced picture of the life that he, and\nwe, and lost. “Our Yoni… We have seen him torn between his passion for\nknowledge on the one hand, and the sense of mission and of personal fulfillment\nthat he found in uniform. There was the Yoni of history and philosophy books:\nPlato and Marx. Who saw the history of Israel not just as a compendium of\nfacts, but a source of inspiration, and a call for action. The Yoni who rebuilt a\ntank battalion reduced to ashes and dust on the Golan. And there was the Yoni\nat peace. Tranquil. At home. With his pipe and his phonograph records, out of\nuniform. We saw him in his hours of supreme achievement and satisfaction. We\nsaw him, too, sometimes standing alone, with pain in his heart, biting his teeth,\n178\ncarrying the heavy, lonely burden of commanding the very fighters who he was\nleading when he fell.\n“We have seen him on the battlefield, engaging the enemy, heading into a\ntest of fire with courage and wisdom and his indomitable spirit – the very\nessence of the spirit that made possible the operation in which he would lose his\nlife.” Because, make no mistake, I said: beyond the weapons used, the people\nwho participated, the training and exercises before the fleet of Hercules had\ntaken off; beyond the fine balance required in the planning, execution, and\ndecision-making; it was “this spirit, this essence, that was tested at Entebbe.”\nWhen I saw Yoni’s family afterwards, though they thanked me for my\nremarks, I could see that they were still bleeding inside. I am sure that affected\nthey way they related to Bruria. Even before Yoni met her, he had told me how\nhard his parents were finding his separation from Tutti. Bruria attended the\nfuneral and the shloshim. But she didn’t sit with the family. I think that with the\nshock of his death, mixed with the pride they felt at his emergence as a national\nhero, they found it difficult to include her, a woman they hardly knew, in their\nmourning.\nA few weeks later, I go a call from the Netanyahu family’s lawyer, Erwin\nShimron. It was an odd, rambling conversation. He seemed to insinuate that, as\nher and Yoni’s neighbor and friend, I was encouraging the unwelcome idea that\nBruria was part of the immediate circle of the bereaved, that this mere girlfriend\nwas somehow his widow. He wanted me to withdraw whatever mantle I might\nbe providing, and help separate her from Yoni and his legacy. He went so far as\nto say that one reason he was calling me was because he didn’t want to have to\ntake “legal steps” to make that happen. I saw no point in getting into an\nargument. I sensed that, while it would take time for the grief felt by those\nclosest to Yoni to begin to heal, the issue would gradually resolve itself. But I\nsaw even less point in leading the lawyer to believe I would do what he was\nsuggesting.\n“Mr Shimron,” I told him. “I knew Yoni. I know Bruria. I do not know you.\nBut I have a musical ear. I don’t like the undertone I hear in what you’ve been\nsaying. I’ve seen them close up. Bruria gave Yoni, at a critical time in his life,\nprobably more warmth than he ever received from any other human being.”\n179\nChapter Eleven\nYet despite Entebbe, the trauma of the Yom Kippur War, and the cracks it\nhad shaken loose in Israeli society and politics, were yet to play themselves out.\nThe hostage rescue was like a sugar rush, an intoxicating reminder that the army\nstill had the capacity for initiative and precision, audacity and quick-fire victory\n– like our air strikes in the first hours of the 1967 War. But the real reckoning\nover 1973 was about to come. It would change Israel beyond recognition, with\nrepercussions still being felt today. It would dramatically alter the course of my\nlife as well.\nI still remember the moment it hit home, on the evening of May 17, 1977. As\nNava and I watched in our tiny living room in Ramat Hasharon, Chaim Yavin,\nthe anchorman on the country’s only TV channel, was handed an exit poll from\nIsrael’s latest national election. He began with three words: Gvirotai verabotai,\nMahapakh. “Ladies and Gentlemen, a revolution.” For the first time since the\nstate was declared, Israel’s government would not be in the hands of David\nBen-Gurion or his Labor Zionist heirs. Our next prime minister would be\nMenachem Begin, who had inherited the mantle of Jabotinsky’s Revisionist\nZionism. He’d headed its youth wing, Betar, in eastern Europe, and led the\nIrgun Zvai Leumi, the main right-wing militia force before 1948. Lacking the\nintellectual depth and subtlety of Jabotsinky –a liberal intellectual who, among\nother things, translated Dante into Hebrew – Begin drew his political strength\nfrom his powerful oratory, and a refusal to countenance any compromise in\nsecuring what he viewed as the ultimate goal: a Jewish state in all of biblical\nPalestine, from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River, with whatever military\nforce was necessary to secure and sustain it.\nBut perhaps Yavin should have used a different metaphor in his dramatic\nelection-night broadcast: reidat adamah, an earthquake. Begin’s victory, after\nthe loss of eight straight elections over three decades, was the culmination of\nseismic rumblings which had been building for years. The big, decisive, shock\nwas the 1973 war. Yet this was not just because of the colossal intelligence\nfailure, or the myriad errors of our military commanders and political leaders. It\nwas the fundamental loss of trust in the cosy, self-perpetuating establishment\nthat had dominated all aspects of Israeli politics, society and culture from the\nstart: Palmachniks like Rabin and Dado; political players like Golda and\nShimon Peres; Haganah veterans like Dayan and Bar-Lev; and, of course, the\nkibbutznik pioneers. Almost all were of East European background –\n180\nAshkenazim – and their prominence and privilege had stoked increasing\nresentment among Israel’s disadvantaged Sephardi majority, with their roots in\nthe Arab world and especially north Africa.\nBegin not only sensed this. While he’d never lost the formal bearing – or the\naccent – from his childhood in Poland, his long years in Israel’s political\nwilderness mirrored the wider exclusion felt by the Sephardim. The last election\nhe had lost, in December 1973, proved too soon for the earth to part. But he told\nhis supporters: “Even though Labour has won these elections, after something\nlike the Yom Kippur War happens to a country, and to a government, they must\nlose power. They will lose power.” He was right. Only twice in the four decades\nthat followed would a Labor leader defeat Begin’s Likud party: Rabin’s election\nvictory in 1992, and mine over Bibi Netanyahu in 1999.\nDuring the first two years of Begin’s rule, however, I was 7,000 miles away.\nTen days before the election, I’d gone to see Motta, and he’d agreed that I could\nreturn to Stanford, to finish what I’d barely begun when the 1973 war broke out.\nI had been in the army, with the one hiatus as a sayeret reservist at Hebrew\nUniversity, since the age of seventeen. I did not regret committing myself to a\nlife in uniform. But Stanford offered an extraordinary opportunity to broaden\nmy horizons. Even in the few weeks I’d spent there before the war, I’d felt\nreinvigorated. It engaged a different kind of intelligence, a different part of who\nI was: the books, the professors. A chance to listen to, and at least try to play,\nbeautiful music. And to spend more than a few stolen evenings or weekends\nwith my family.\nThe timing had nothing to do with the election. Like most other Labor\nIsraelis, and many of Begin’s own supporters, I hadn’t expected the Likud to\nwin. It was because I felt I’d reached a natural punctuation mark in my military\ncareer. I’d led Sayeret Matkal. I’d commanded a tank company, a battalion in\n1973, and, more briefly than I’d hoped, the 401 st Brigade after the war. I’d spent\nthe last two years in the kirya. The next step up the command chain would be to\nlead a full armored division. But at age 35, I was probably too young, and I\nfigured I’d have a far better chance in two years’ time. I also feared losing the\nchance to go to Stanford altogether. Motta’s term as chief of staff would end the\nfollowing year. Among those in the frame to succeed him was Raful Eitan.\nRecalling Raful’s dismissive, almost sneering, opposition to my making the\nSayeret Matkal into Israel’s SAS, I wasn’t exactly confident I could count on\nhis support.\n181\nReluctant though I’d been to leave the 401 st for the kirya, I had particularly\nenjoyed the last year. I was promoted to Shai Tamari’s job, in charge of the\nintelligence team for our military operations, when Shai left to command a tank\nbrigade. My office was no longer on the third floor, but in the underground\nbunker, the bor. I was part of nearly all high-level planning meetings, often with\nMotta, sometimes also including Peres. Almost everyone around the table was\nolder than me, and outranked me by some distance. Yet with my intelligence\nbrief, I was often the one with the most thorough command of the details.\nThough still just a colonel, I’d risen through Sayeret Matkal. I knew the\nplanning process from the other side as well, having attended the same sort of\nmeetings, from the early 1960s, to present our operations. So I was often asked,\nand always welcome, to weigh in on what would work, what wouldn’t, and\nwhy.\nMy final year in the kirya also further cemented my relationship with Motta.\nThough as chief of staff, he tended to keep a formal distance from all but his\nfellow generals, he did seem to enjoy having me around. He even put me in\ncharge of a new department of my own. Not officially. The “department” was\nstrictly ad hoc, as was the name which Motta gave it: Mishugas. The Yiddish\nword for craziness.\nAll army commanders, in all countries, receive their share of unsolicited\nadvice. But I can’t imagine any of them gets the number, or sheer range, of wild\nsuggestions which make their way to the kirya. Everything from levitation\nmachines, to ideas for making tanks fly. Motta didn’t have the time to read all\nthe letters, much less sit down with the self-styled inventors or sages who\nshowed up in person. Still, he couldn’t be sure that a jewel of an idea wasn’t\nlurking inside one of them. As an insurance policy, he began sending all the\nletters, and every supplicant, to me.\nI never found the jewel. The most vivid memory I have is of a visit from a\nformer soldier in Shaked, Israel’s Negev reconnaissance and tracking unit. He\nhad taken up meditation, and the study of ancient civilizations. Fresh from a\nperiod of contemplation in the desert, he arrived in my office with a pamphlet\nhe’d written. It was about special-forces strategy and training, as practiced eight\ncenturies earlier, in the time of Genghis Khan.\nI listened for nearly an hour, enjoying his enthusiasm, the history lesson, and\nthe simple weirdness of it all. I did check his facts afterwards. If nothing else, he\nproved an assiduous student of the Mongols. He explained to me that in their\nlargest battles, involving tens of thousands of troops, they would designate a\n182\ncommando unit of a couple of dozen men. Its sole task was to seek out and kill\nthe enemy force’s leader. The key to their success was mind-training. Over a\nperiod of months, sometimes years, the commandos’ self-perception was\naltered. They were taught to believe that they had already died. Since their lives\non earth were done, all that remained was a formal passage through the turnstile\ninto eternal happiness, and to go out in glory. My visitor not only suggested that\nIsrael establish exactly this kind of death-cum-suicide unit. He volunteered to\ntrain the men himself, and lead the first mission. With as straight a face as I\ncould muster, I thanked him for taking the time to see me. But I told him his\nidea was probably not for us. Little did I know that a whole new kind of enemy,\nepitomized by Al-Qaeda and the self-styled Islamic State, would build a\nterrorist death cult around it.\n* * *\nNava and I, with three-year-old Yael, and Michal just turning seven, left for\nCalifornia in the late summer of 1977. The two years that followed were\nuplifting and reinvigorating – not just because of Stanford, but a further, utterly\nunexpected transformation back home soon after we’d left.\nIt, too had its roots in the 1973 war, but on the Arab side. Before the war,\nEgypt’s Anwar Sadat had extended feelers about the possibility of peace\nnegotiations, only to see them ignored. Israel won the war in the end. But the\nEgyptians’ surprise attack across the canal – and the panic and huge Israeli\nlosses in the early days of the war – had shattered our aura of invincibility.\nPolitically, Sadat had gone a long way to erasing the humiliation of 1967. That\nfreed him to do something which – after decades of Arab-Israeli conflict – was\nastonishing. He travelled to Jerusalem, the capital of a country which neither\nEgypt nor any other Arab country even recognized. He met Begin, and he\naddressed the Knesset with a call for peace.\nIt is impossible to convey to Israelis who did not live through the birth of the\nstate, and our tumultuous early decades, the power of the emotions stirred by\nSadat’s visit. It was on November 19, 1977. With my arm around Nava, I\nwatched the live American television coverage as Sadat’s plane touched down\nat Ben-Gurion airport. Begin was at the center of the throng of dignitaries on\nhand to greet him: a who’s who of political and military leaders not just from\nhis administration, but who had led Israel in 1967 and 1973. Golda was there.\n183\nRabin, too, puffing furiously on his cigarette. When the erect figure of Sadat\nemerged, there was spontaneous applause, and a serenade from Israeli army\ntrumpeters.\nEven before Sadat’s Knesset address the next day, I understood that his visit,\nhis willingness to make the first, bold move toward a possible peace, marked\njust the beginning of a difficult negotiating road. But there was one passage in\nhis speech that touched me especially. He ran through the history of how Egypt\nand other Arab states had not just fought Israel, but denied our right to exist as a\nstate. “We used to brand you as so-called Israel,” he said. Now, the leader of\nour most important Arab enemy declared: “You want to live with us in this part\nof the world. In all sincerity, I tell you that we welcome you among us, with full\nsecurity and safety.”\nThe formula he proposed was straightforward. Egypt would agree to a full\npeace, accepting and formally recognizing the state of Israel. But Israel would\nhave to withdraw from all Arab land captured in 1967, including “Arab\nJerusalem.” We would also have to accept the “rights of the Palestinian people\nto self-determination, including their right to establish their own state.” Begin’s\nreply was more sensitive than I’d expected from a leader who, through my\nLabor kibbutnzik eyes, I’d always seen as an extremist, unwaveringly\ncommitted to a “greater Israel”. Though he did make it clear his views on the\nshape of an eventual peace differed from Sadat’s, he proposed further talks with\nthe aim of finding an agreement both sides could live with. Still, like all Israelis,\nI knew he would never accept at least two of the Egyptian president’s demands:\na retreat from our control of a united Jerusalem or the creation of a Palestinian\nstate on the West Bank of the Jordan: for Begin, biblical Judaea and Samaria.\nOn our territorial dispute with Egypt, I did believe a deal was possible. I\ndidn’t expect us to return all of the Sinai, if only because I couldn’t see Begin\nagreeing to it. For security reasons, I also felt we should try to hold on to a pair\nof air force bases built after 1967, with American help, just a few miles over the\nNegev border. But as for the rest, I saw no reason not to give it back. As I’d told\nMotta after the 1973 war, I’d long believed Israel had lost sight of the original\nreason we’d held onto the Sinai after 1967. It was supposed to be a huge, sandy\nsecurity buffer. If we did manage to make peace with Egypt, there was surely no\nreason to hold on to it.\nThe moment of truth came almost exactly 10 months later, in September\n1978. American President Jimmy Carter hosted a summit with Begin and Sadat\nat Camp David, in search of a “framework agreement” for final negotiations on\n184\na peace treaty. Again, I was watching closely, via American TV. But as the\nsummit was winding down, our phone suddenly rang in Palo Alto.\n“Ehud, how’s it going? Are you following what’s happening here? What do\nyou think?”\nI recognized the voice immediately: Ezer Weizman, the former fighter pilot\nBegin had chosen as his defense minister. I’d known Ezer since the early 1960s,\nwhen he’d been commander of the air force and Sayeret Matkal was planning\nits first operations. Still, even though he had a reputation for batting ideas back\nand forth outside the bounds of hierarchy or chain of command, I was startled to\nhear from him.\n“What do I think about what?” I said.\n“The solution we’ve arrived at here. We found there was no way but to give\nback everything.” The only exception was Taba, a sliver of land where the\nNegev met the eastern edge of the Sinai, across from the Jordanian town of\nAqaba.\n“Was there no way to convince them, even with some kind of a land swap, to\nkeep the two air bases?” I asked.\n“Believe me, we wanted to,” Ezer replied. “But no way. Not if we were\ngoing to get a peace treaty.”\nSo I said the obvious: if that’s what was necessary for peace, there was no\nother choice.\nWe were now well into our final year at Stanford. Our home was in a leafy\n“student village” off campus, called Escondito, for married students from\nabroad. Our two-storey flat was one of a row of cabin-like structures: a bit like a\nkibbutz, only smaller, American-style, a lot more upmarket. It had a fenced-off\nplay area for the children and, in a common room for all the village residents, an\nupright piano.\nI found the richness of the academic environment – and the time to explore\nand savor it – enthralling. I’d chosen my master’s program at Stanford because\nit offered the chance to learn across a range of different schools and disciplines.\nThe official home for my degree courses was the School of Engineering, in a\ndepartment called “Engineering-Economic Systems”. Its focus was on applying\nmathematical modelling and analysis to decision-making in “large and complex\n185\norganizations” such as private companies or government departments. Or the\narmed forces of Israel. The theorists at Stanford were leaders in the field.\nBut from the start, I was drawn to other disciplines as well: business,\neconomics, political science, history, sociology, psychology. I studied game\ntheory at the business school, and the evolution of political systems under the\nsociologist Seymour Martin Lipset. I also went to lectures by James G. March,\non how psychological, social and other factors influenced decision-making. I\nparticularly enjoyed learning from Professor Amos Tversky. Born in Haifa, he\nwas half of an academic partnership with the psychologist Daniel Kahneman,\nwho was also Israeli. They were investigating the effect of human bias and other\nsubjective factors on how we perceive reality, and thus make decisions.\nTversky’s work especially fascinated me, because it questioned a basic\nassumption in the kind of predictive formulas my own department was\nadvancing: that we make choices rationally, calculating the outcomes of\ncompeting alternatives. Tversky had found that the human brain didn’t always\nwork that way. For choices with a fairly obvious outcome – 90 percent of cases,\nsay – the assumption did hold. But at the margins, the brain didn’t, or couldn’t,\nalways gauge the implications of a decision accurately. A couple of decades\nlater, he would also show that an individual’s choice could vary significantly\ndepending on the way the options were presented.\nThese behavioural and psychological approaches were at odds with what was\nbeing taught in my home faculty. Its prevailing orthodoxy was that by using\nspecifically designed interview techniques, alongside mathematical modelling\nof the predicted outcomes, we could isolate the effect of human agency on how,\nand what, decisions were made. Yet the wider my studies had ranged, the more\nsceptical I became that the complexities of human decision-making could be\naccommodated by such models. I also saw problems in the methodology we\nwere using. Since it was based partly on interviews with participants in the\ndecision-making process, it seemed to me that this introduced a subjective\nelement into our ostensibly objective conclusions.\nMy department wasn’t enamored with my views on our modeling approach.\nBut one of the things I most valued about my time in Stanford was that, far from\ndiscouraging my excursions into other departments, my professors combined a\nconfidence in their own approach with a genuine open-mindedness to other\nideas: the hallmark of true intellectuals, and of great universities.\nI got something else from my studies at Stanford, although I didn’t speak\nabout it at the time, not even to Nava. I became aware that I had a particular\n186\naptitude for focusing on the minute details of a problem, yet never losing sight\nof the larger picture, the wider issues. From my experience as commander of\nthe sayeret and during the 1973 war, and from watching other officers whom I\nrespected, it struck me that this was an essential part of effective leadership.\nBy “leadership”, at that stage in my life, I did not mean political leadership. I\nwas thinking in terms of the army. But I’d now finished my masters degree, and\nit was impossible to be unaware of the political context in which I’d be\nreturning to uniform. Since Camp David, our negotiators and the Egyptians had\nbeen trying to thrash out a formal deal. Sadat was being denounced as a traitor\nin the Arab world. Begin was seen by most in the outside world, and many\nIsraelis, as dragging his feet on the negotiations and risking the chance for peace\naltogether. If we did manabge to sign a peace treaty, however, we would be\nwithdrawing for the first time from land captured in 1967. That would mean\nfinding a new approach to security in the south, as well as a new focus on the\nmajority of our Arab neighbors who were railing against Sadat and seemed less\ninterested than ever in making peace.\nIn some ways, it was hard to leave our mini-kibbutz in Palo Alto. Michal,\nnow nearly nine, had thrived, quickly learning English and ending up with a\nperfectly American accent which has never left her. Yael has less vivid\nmemories of our time there. But we’d had the nearest thing to a normal family\nlife since our first, war-truncated, time at Stanford. During the university\nholidays, we’d also travelled: to Canada. Mexico. Lake Tahoe. Even Las Vegas,\nwhere, thankfully, we lacked the money to chance our luck, but where my years\nin the sayeret suddenly came in handy. We spent the day at Circus Circus, a\njoint casino-and-theme park tailored for families with kids. At a shooting\ngallery in the amusement area, I had no trouble landing dead-center hits on a\npassing procession of metal geese, to the consternation of the guy behind the\ncounter but the delight of my two young daughters. In probably the single\ngreatest moment of parental accomplishment I’d experienced since their birth, I\nbagged a huge fluffy teddy bear for each of them.\n* * *\nI returned to Israel not just with the hope, but a reasonable expectation, that I\nwould get command of one of Israel’s two regular armored divisions: the 252 nd ,\nwhich was responsible for defending the south and, at least for now, was based\n187\nin the Sinai. Dan Shomron was now head of the southern command and had told\nme, before we headed back from California, that he’d recommended me for the\npost. It was an especially exciting prospect because the US-backed negotiations\nwith Egypt did finally appear to be nearing an agreement. As commander of\nDivision 252, I’d be coordinating and implementing Israel’s Sinai withdrawal.\nBut I didn’t get the job, at least not on my return. Raful Eitan had indeed\nsucceeded Motta as chief of staff, and he had the final say. I’d evidently been\nright to assume I would figure no higher in his estimation than I had as sayeret\ncommander. To be fair, however, he did agree to my becoming commander of\nDan’s reserve division in the south: the same 611 th that Arik Sharon had led\nacross the canal in 1973. When I took up that post in April 1979 – just days\nafter the formal Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty was indeed signed – I was also\npromoted. I became a one-star general. And eighteen months later, when the\nregular division post came open again, I did get the nod to command the 252 nd .\nEven then, it was a close-run thing. Raful called me in to see him and said he\nwanted me to return to the kirya instead, in the one-star general’s post inside\nmilitary intelligence. He said he had more than enough candidates for division\ncommander, but that my previous experience meant I was the best choice for the\nintelligence post. I was determined to remain in the field, especially with signs\nthat Begin, and certainly his more right-wing supports in the Likud, were\nalready having second thoughts about the peace deal we’d struck with Egypt. In\npart, they feared that a withdrawal from any of the land taken in the 1967 war\nmight create a precedent, and invite pressure, for more withdrawals. But the real\nbuyers’ remorse centered on the fact that, as part of the initial agreement at\nCamp David, Begin had needed to accept a parallel framework for negotiations\ntoward a broader peace that would include the West Bank and Gaza\nPalestinians.\nIn any case, with Raful balking a second time at giving me the division\ncommand, I figured I had little to lose by fightinhg my corner, and telling him\nexactly what I felt. “Look, I realize that you’re chief of staff,” I said. “But don’t\nforget we’re both just temporarily in whatever role we hold. I’m not here as a\ndraftee. I’m in the army by choice. It’s your decision to tell me what position\nyou want me to take. But you can’t impose anything. I can always leave. Or I\ncan bide my time until you leave.” Raful apparently concluded he couldn’t\nactually force me to take the intelligence job. With Dan having made his\npreference clear, he didn’t press the point.\n188\nMy main responsibility as commander of the 252 nd was to implement the\nwithdrawal from the Sinai. Israel had committed itself to bring all of our forces\nbehind the 1967 border within next two years, and, along with Dan, I threw my\nenergy into planning and implementing the terms of the treaty. But especially\nwith Begin soon facing a reelection campaign against Labor, now led by\nShimon Peres, he was keen to play to the opponents of any further negotiating\nconcessions. He was positioning himself as the voice of military strength, and\npainting Peres as someone who would risk our security by going further than\nthe separate peace with Sadat.\nBegin had no more experience or knowledge of military details than Shimon.\nBut from his days in the pre-state Irgun, he’d been an unapologetic admirer of\nmen of military action. After his victory in the 1977 election, he’d formed a\ngovernment stocked with some of Israel’s best-known former generals. Not just\nEzer Weizman. He’d brought back Moshe Dayan, as foreign minister. And as\nagriculture minister, the country’s most swashbuckingly self-confident, and\ncontroversial, battlefield commander: Arik Sharon. Begin had recently lost both\nEzer and Dayan, who accused him of deliberatedly torpedoing chances of\nbuilding on the peace with Egypt. But Arik was still there, four-square behind a\nmore forceful military posture on Israel’s other fronts. As agriculture minister,\nhe had also been the driving force in a plan for settlement “blocs” designed to\nencircle the main Arab towns and cities on the West Bank and foreclose any\nrealistic prospect of a Palestinian state.\nAfter Begin’s second election victory, in June 1981, some commentators,\nand many in Labor, insisted that he’d won because of a dramatic surprise air\nstrike, a few weeks before election day, against a French-built nuclear reactor\noutside Baghdad. I never believed that, in part because I knew from intelligence\nfriends that the attack had been set for earlier, and was put back because of fears\nthe plan might become public. But mostly because of what I witnessed in the\nheart of Tel Aviv the night before the election, when I joined one of my top\nofficers, a Likudnik, at Begin’s final campaign rally.\nShimon still had a narrow lead in the polls. I hadn’t been at his closing rally,\nthe previous evening. But like the rest of Israel, I’d heard and read about it, in\nparticular the warm-up act: a popular, solidly pro-Labor comedian and actor\nnamed Dudu Topaz. Greeting the crowd, he’d said what a pleasure it was that it\nwas not full of chachachim. The word was sneering Israeli slang: for uncouth,\nuncultured Sephardim, not far from the equivalent of using the “n” word in\nAmerica. In a single sentence, he’d managed to sum up everything the\n189\nSephardim resented about the Ashkenazi, Labor Zionist establishment. Begin, at\nhis rally, played it like a virtuoso. “Did you hear what they called you?” he\ncried. Chachachim. He slightly mispronounced the word, as if he’d never heard,\nmuch less used, it before, and that even having to repeat it made his blood\ncurdle. “Is that what you are?” There was pandemonium. Maybe Begin would\nhave won anyway. But it was close, just one Knesset seat between the two\nmajor parties. And win, he did.\nI became increasingly convinced in the weeks that followed that Begin’s\nsecond government, with Arik now moved to defense minister, would further\nput the brakes on any follow-up negotiations for a deal with the Palestinians. I\ndid not yet know that Arik, in particular, had a far more ambitious, military plan\nto try to bury the possibility of a Palestinian state once and for all. But I did\nknow he had his eyes on a possible thrust across our northern border into\nLebanon, where Arafat and the PLO were based.\nThere was no public mention of any of this. But several times in 1981, I was\nordered to move a large part of my division onto the Golan Heights for weeks at\na time: two brigades, 200 tanks and dozens of APCs in a massive motorcade\nfrom the bottom to the top of the country and back again. We dubbed it\nCinerama, from the Hebrew words for Sinai and the Heights, Ramah. If there\nwas an escalation of hostilities, the northern command’s regular division would\ncross into Lebanon. Our role would be to take their place in defending the\nGolan, and possibly follow them in.\nWhen I returned from my final episode of Cinerama in the late summer of\n1981, the Sinai withdrawal was entering its final stage. I organized a full-scale\nmilitary exercise on the roughly one-third of the Egyptian desert we still held,\nknowing that we’d no longer have the room to do so after the final withdrawal.\nIt was the largest exercise I’d ever commanded. The advances and tactical\nretreats, the flanking maneuvers and ambushes and fighter jet attacks were like\na very big war in a very small place.\nBut a war game was not a real war. The Sinai was not like the Golan, or the\ncramped, hilly confines of Lebanon. And it was in Lebanon, the following year,\nthat the war came. It was different from any in Israel’s history. Arik was in\ncharge. And I would become involved in ways which began to change the way I\nsaw not only Arik, but the political and military direction of our country.\n190\nChapter Twelve\nMy own part in the Lebanon war would change dramatically as a result of\nthat last military exercise in the Sinai. Arik Sharon was now Minister of\nDefense, and he came for the final afternoon. From his experience as a frontline\ncommander – in 1956, 1967 and 1973 – he knew the dunes and wadis and\nsprawling expanses of sand as well as any general in Israel. Watching our\nintricate mini-war draw to its close, he made no effort to hide his enthusiasm for\nthe kind of quick, assertive battlefield maneuvers he’d long championed. But\nmore than that, his closest aide soon began sounding me out on my views about\nthe long-term organization, force balance and funding for the Israeli military. A\nfew weeks later, Arik offered me a promotion: a return to the kirya, as a twostar\ngeneral, to become head of planning for the armed forces.\nI don’t know why he chose me: the Sinai exercise perhaps, the fact he knew\nI’d studied “large and complex organizations” at Stanford, or maybe just the\nfact our paths had first crossed two decades earlier when I was in Sayeret\nMatkal. But even though it meant leaving my division command, especially\ntough since the final Sinai withdrawal was approaching, it was an offer I never\ncontemplated turning down. Not just because of the second star on my uniform.\nEver since the 1973 war, along with a few other senior officers including Dan\nShomron, I had been making the case for a shift to more mobile and less\nvulnerable forces and weapons systems. I saw the new role as a chance to help\nencourage that critically important change.\nThere was just one hitch: all senior military assignments required the formal\napproval of the chief-of-staff, my old friend Raful Eitan. Raful did manage to\ndelay things for several weeks. At one point, he even brought to bear a quality\nI’d never suspected he had: a sense of humor. “OK, I’ll agree to promote\nBarak,” he told Arik. The next day, he said he’d meant Eitan Barak – a very\ngood commander, by the way, who had been one of my instructors in officers’\nschool. Arik insisted, however. My appointment went through.\nAnd one, unanticipated result was that I didn’t just play the field command\nrole I’d anticipated, from our Cinerama deployments, in Arik’s toweringly\nambitious, ill-planned and ultimately disastrous war in Lebanon. I became part\nof months of planning discussions in the kirya before our tanks finally rumbled\nacross the northern border on the morning of June 6, 1982.\n191\nMy new posting came not just as momentum was building toward an\ninvasion. It followed on the heels of a major new crisis in our peace with Egypt.\nOnly weeks before I gave up my Sinai command, President Anwar Sadat was\nshot and killed by an extremist Muslim officer at the annual Cairo military\nparade to mark the anniversary of the 1973 war.\nLike many Israelis, I felt an almost familial sense of bereavement. Sadat was\nnot just the first Arab leader to make peace with Israel. He seemed to\nunderstand us: people who were ready, willing and able to fight, but wanted\nabove all to live unmolested and accepted by our neighbors. Yet for Begin and\nthe Likud, I knew the assassination would cast the whole peace process into\ndoubt. Sadat’s successor, Vice-President Hosni Mubarak, did make it clear he\nwould abide by the peace treaty, defusing calls on the Israeli right for us to\ncancel our final withdrawal from the Sinai. But after Sadat’s killing, Begin and\nthose around him seemed more determined than ever to hold the line against the\nwider peace negotiations agreed with President Carter and Sadat at Camp\nDavid. At Begin’s insistence, Camp David had not proposed giving the\nPalestinians a state, but instead “autonomy” and a locally elected “selfgoverning\nauthority”. Yet that was defined as a transitional period. The elected\nPalestinians were to be included in negotiations for a yet-unspecified “final\nstatus” arrangement for the West Bank and Gaza. That, Begin feared, left the\ndoor ajar for something more than autonomy. Shutting that door, I would soon\ndiscover, was a big part of Arik’s ornate reasoning for invading Lebanon.\nBeyond the fact that my new job was a promotion, I had a personal reason\nfor welcoming the move back to Tel Aviv. Ten days after Sadat’s assassination,\nI had endured a frightening few days surrounding the birth of our third daughter,\nAnat. The crisis was another reminder that the demands of frontline command\nrested not just on my shoulders, but my family’s. We had moved house again\nearly in Nava’s pregnancy, to the suburb of Ra’anana, about 10 miles north of\nTel Aviv and a few miles in from the coast. We bought one of a newly built row\nof small, semi-detached townhouses which, best of all, had a backyard. It was\ntiny by American standards, but was still a place for the girls to play. Once\nagain, however, I wasn’t there when my daughter was born. I was rushing north\nas Nava went into labor.\nThe birth itself went smoothly. By the time I got to the hospital, both baby\nand mother seemed happy and healthy. A few days later, however, when they\nwere back in the townhouse and I’d returned to my division, Nava felt suddenly,\ndesperately unwell. I shudder to think what might have happened were it not for\n192\nthe fact that one of our new neighbors was a friend from my first military\nintelligence stint in the kirya. In almost paralyzing pain, Nava phoned him, and\nhe rushed her to the hospital. It turned out that the doctor who delivered Anat\nhad left part of the placenta inside. Once the mistake was discovered – as I was\nagain speeding north – he went back in and rectified it. When I arrived, I was\nrelieved, to put it mildly, to find Nava smiling bravely, and on her way back to\nfull health. Still, doctor friends of mine told me that if the problem not been\ndiagnosed and addressed quickly, she could have suffered shock, serious\ninfection, even death.\n* * *\nIn my new role, I was nominally responsible to both the defense minister and\nthe chief of staff, but Arik made it clear to both me and Raful that he was boss.\nAnd though my official brief was longer-term planning, almost from day-one\nthe issue of Lebanon overshadowed all others. I knew, from Cinerama, that\npreparations for a possible military operation in Lebanon were underway. Yet\nfrom my first meeting with Arik and Raful, it became clear it was more than just\na possibility. “Why the hell is Arafat still alive,” Arik snapped at us. He said\nthat when he’d been commander of Unit 101, he’d never waited for the\ngovernment to ask him to plan an operation. He’d plan it himself, and go to\nministers for approval. When I told him that I’d done just that when I was\ncommander of the sayeret, only to be told Arafat was “not a target,” Arik\nreplied: well, he is now. The PLO leader’s current residence was on the\nsouthern edge of Beirut, and in the weeks ahead Arik left no doubt that he\nmeant to go after him there.\nTo anyone looking from the outside, there was no pressing reason to expect a\nwar. It is true that the potential for conflict was always there. The PLO had\nnearly 20,000 fighters in Lebanon and hundreds of rockets capable of reaching\nour northern towns and settlements. The Syrians were there, too. As part of an\nArab League agreement in 1976 to quell two years of terrible civil war between\nLebanon’s traditionally dominant Maronite Christians and an alliance of PLO\nand Lebanese Muslim forces, some 30,000 Syrian troops had been brought in as\nthe core of a peacekeeping force. But in the summer of 1981, new US President\nRonald Reagan’s Mideast envoy, Undersecretary of State Philip Habib, had\n193\nbrokered a cease-fire to halt Palestinian Katyusha rocket fire into Israel. It was\ngenerally holding.\nBut fundamentally, Arik’s war plan was not a response to the Katyushas. It\nwas a way of using military force to achieve Prime Minister Begin’s political\naim: stopping the Camp David peace process in its tracks, and ensuring it did\nnot go beyond the peace treaty with Egypt. And even that message was not\nprincipally intended for the Palestinians, I suspect, but for the Americans.\nIsrael’s Labor-led governments had always calculated that we needed at least\nsome measure of support from foreign allies, especially the US. Under Begin,\nwe’d already bombed Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor without telling the\nAmericans beforehand. Shortly after I returned to the kirya, he provoked further\nanger in Washington by announcing the de facto annexation of the Golan – in\neffect “balancing” our Sinai withdrawal with a dramatic reassertion of Israeli\ncontrol over other land captured in the 1967 war. Part of Arik’s plan in Lebanon\nwas to deliver an even more forceful riposte to any suggestion that we would\ngive up control of the West Bank and Gaza.\nYet these political aims, which I was gradually beginning to grasp in their\nfull form through my discussions with Arik, were only part of the reason I was\ndeeply uneasy about the plans for our Lebanon invasion. Having now spent\nnearly two decades in the military, I recognized that the security challenge north\nof the border was real. I did not believe it was inherently wrong for Begin’s\ngovernment to order a pre-emptive military operation with the aim of ending it.\nMy view, as an army officer, was that the decision on how, when and whether\nto go to war was for our elected government. But for that principle to work, I\nalso believed that government ministers had to know what they were deciding.\nThe more we geared up for an invasion, the less certain I became that Begin’s\ncabinet understood what we were planning to do.\nArik’s original plan was codenamed Oranim: Hebrew for “pine trees”. It\ninvolved pushing deep into Lebanon, all the way up to the strategically critical\nroad that ran between Beirut and Damascus. We would link up in Beirut with\nthe main Maronite Christian force, the Phalangists, whom we had been\nsupporting and training for several years. When that plan was presented to\nBegin’s cabinet at the end of 1981, however, most ministers opposed it. Thus\nwas born Arik’s Plan B, so-called “Little Pines”. Its stated aim was a lot more\nmodest. We would create a “security zone” – a 40-kilometer, or 25-mile, strip\nrunning north of the border with Lebanon.\n194\nI could see that Little Pines was a kind of fiction. All you had to do was take\na map and draw in the 40-kilometer line. In the areas nearer the Mediterranean,\nin the western and central parts of the border area, it indeed covered territory\ncontrolled by armed PLO groups. But in the eastern sector, there were Syrian\npositions a mere 10 to 12 kilometers up from the border, well inside the\n“security zone”. Not much further north were two full Syrian divisions. That\nmeant we’d be fighting not just the Palestinians, which was the ostensible aim\nof Little Pines. We would have to take on Syria. As soon as those hostilities\nbegan, we would have to destroy radar and SAM sites in the Syrian-controlled\nBeka’a Valley further north into Lebanon. After the first costly days of the 1973\nwar in the Sinai, we were not about to enter a major conflict without ensuring\nair superiority. Unless the Syrians retreated or surrendered, the inevitable result\nwould be a wider conflict, not limited to dealing with Palestinian fighters in\nsouth Lebanon but paving the way for Arik to go ahead with his original plan\nand push all the way to Beirut.\nThis wasn’t mere supposition on my part. In February 1982, we ran a\nsimulation exercise in the kirya based on Plan B. The result: Little Pines became\nBig Pines. A clash with the Syrians proved inevitable, if only because one target\neven under Little Pines was the main road between Beirut and Damascus. It lay\nwell beyond the 40-kilometer line. As the main supply route for their forces in\nthe interior of Lebanon, it was also of critical importance for the Syrians. So any\nidea of a quick, limited strike to establish a security zone was fantasy. A few\ndays later, Raful chaired a wide-ranging discussion on Lebanon. Near the end of\nthe session, I asked him directly whether government ministers were aware that\nour war plan “will inevitably lead to a clash with the Syrians”. Raful hesitated\nfor a second, but then answered briskly: “Yes.”\nThat assurance would turn out to be untrue. But my wider concern, as the\nweeks passed, was Arik’s political plan, of which I was getting an ever clearer\nidea from him. It struck me as not just grand, but grandiose. Part of it was to\nobliterate Arafat as a political force, if not by killing him then by forcing him\nand every one of his fighters from Lebanon, a country Arik wanted to place\nunder the unchallenged control of the most prominent of the younger generation\nof Christian Phalangist politicians, Bashir Gemayel. I felt all that would be\nchallenging enough. But in Arik’s eyes, this was only part of a complete\nreordering of our conflict with the Arabs. He expected Gemayel’s Lebanon to\nopenly align itself with Israel and expel all Syrian troops. As for the expelled\nPalestinians, they would go back to Jordan where they would resume – and, this\ntime, win – their civil war with King Hussein. The result, with Hussein deposed,\n195\nwould be a “Palestinian state” in Jordan, which would free Israel to retain openended,\nunchallenged, control of the West Bank.\nEven the Labor party, fifteen years into Israel’s occupation of the West\nBank, was still speaking about a “Jordanian option” for an eventual political\nsettlement with the Palestinians who lived there – though this meant a kind of\nconfederation with Jordan under Hussein’s rule. Very few Israelis began\nseriously to engage with the Palestinians own separate identity or national\naspirations until later in the 1980s – when I, too, would do so, amid the\nwidespread Palestinian unrest known as the intifada. But even without a fully\nthought-out view on these issues, I was taken aback by Arik’s almost godlike\nsupposition that he could use fire and brimstone, or the modern military\nequivalent, to remake the Middle East as he and Begin wished to see it. If only\nbecause of the tacit assumption that the outside world, and especially the\nAmericans, would sit by and let the whole drama play out as scripted, it struck\nme as an exercise in self-delusion.\nThere was also the matter of Arik’s vision of a “new” Lebanon under Bashir\nGemayel’s Phalangists. Unlike the other generals in the kirya, I’d never actually\nmet any of our “Lebanese Christian allies”. Yet a few weeks after taking up my\nnew post, I was invited to a lunchtime discussion with a group of Phalangist\nofficers on a training course in Israel. I emerged both unsettled and\nunderwhelmed. They were obviously politically astute. They bandied around\nmilitary vocabulary proficiently enough. But they were a bit like teenagers\nplaying with guns: full of macho, and too much after-shave. Hardly the kind of\n“army” I could see as a lynchpin in Arik’s plan to redraw the geopolitical map\nof the Middle East.\n* * *\nBy June 1982, Arik’s invasion was a war simply waiting for a credible\ntrigger. On the evening of June 3, Palestinian terrorists shot and critically\nwounded Israel’s ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov. Appalling though the\nattack was, as a catalyst for a full-scale invasion, it seemed unlikely to be\nenough for the Reagan Administration. Habib’s cease-fire terms did not include\nterror attacks like the one in London. It was meant to keep the PLO from firing\nacross our northern border. Even to some Israelis, the attack on Ambassador\nArgov seemed more a rationale than a reason for war. But Begin summoned an\n196\nemergency cabinet meeting the next day. His adviser on terrorism, Gideon\nMachanaimi, was someone I knew well. When the cabinet convened, he pointed\nout to the ministers that the London terrorists were from a fringe Palestinian\ngroup led by Abu Nidal. Far from being an ally of Arafat, he had been\nsentenced to death by Fatah. According to Gideon, Begin wasn’t interested in\nthe distinction. Even less so were the two leading military figures in attendance:\nArik and Raful. They said all Palestinian terror was the responsibility of Arafat,\nand that now was the time to hit back hard. The cabinet was informed that our\ninitial response would be limited: aerial and artillery bombardment of PLO\ntargets throughout Lebanon. Yet Raful told the cabinet that the Palestinians\nwould almost certainly respond with shell and rocket fire into Israel. Then, he\nsaid, we could strike more forcefully. In other words, the invasion would begin.\nIt did. Dubbed “Operation Peace for Galilee” to convey the aim of protecting\nnorthern Israel from shell and rocket fire, it got underway at around 11 a.m. on\nSunday June 6. The publicly declared aim was Little Pines: the establishment of\nour 40-kilometer security zone. Both Israelis and the Americans were led to\nbelieve it would be a relatively short operation aimed at destroying the PLO’s\nmilitary capacity in the border area. We also said that we wouldn’t attack Syrian\nforces as long as they didn’t attack us.\nThat last public pledge had particular relevance to my role on the ground. I\nwas deputy commander of the largest of Israel’s three invasion forces, under\nYanoush Ben-Gal, head of the northern command until shortly before the war.\nWe had 30,000 troops and 600 tanks and were responsible for the “eastern\nsector” – from the edge of the Golan Heights, north through the Bekaa Valley\nalong Lebanon’s border with Syria. At first, we deliberately stopped short of\nSyrian forces. We deployed our main reserve division just 10 kilometers across\nthe border, below the first Syrian positions at the bottom of the Bekaa. But\ndespite the public assurances we were in Lebanon to establish our security zone,\nwe had no orders to halt at the 40-kilometer line. From day one, our part of the\ninvasion force began a pincer movement around the area of eastern Lebanon\nwhere large numbers of Syrian soldiers were based. My former Sinai division,\nthe 252 nd , came down from the Golan and started making its way up alongside\nthe Syrian border. Our other units, further inland, also began pushing\nnorthward.\nFor the first couple of days, we did avoid a confrontation with the Syrians.\nYet on June 8, day three of the war, the morphing of Little Pines into Big Pines\nbegan.\n197\nThe two other Israeli invasion forces had crossed the border parallel to us,\none pushing up through the steep hills and twisting valleys of central Lebanon,\nand the other along the Mediterranean coast. The central force was now ordered\nto mount an attack that would bring them within striking distance of the Beirut-\nDamasus road. The first skirmish came in the hilltop town of Jezzin, still barely\nwithin the 40-kilometer zone. The Syrians had a commando force and tanks in\nthe town. An Israeli battalion was ordered in, and it took Jezzin by the evening\nof June 8. But it came under assault from Syrian units with grenades, RPGs and\nSaggers, as well as shellfire from a nearby ridge. Shortly before midnight,\nanother unit of Israeli tanks and infantry passed through the central Lebanese\nvillage of Ayn Zhalta, to the north of Jezzin and beyond the 40-kilometer line,\nand began winding its way through a valley toward the Beirut-Damascus road.\nThey waded into a Syrian ambush, and for hours found themselves in a fierce\nbattle with Syrian units.\nI don’t believe Arik specifically planned to confront the Syrians in Jezzin\nand Ayn Zhalta. But he could not have doubted that, given the enormous scale\nand range of our invasion, a clash with Syrian forces would happen at some\npoint. Now that it had, all that remained was for him to tell the cabinet that\nIsraeli forces had come under Syrian fire and insist, as defense minister, that the\nimperative for our forces on the ground was to strike back.\nOn the afternoon of June 9, the fourth day of the war, we got the order to go\non the offensive against the Syrians in the Bekaa. As our artillery pounded the\nsouthernmost SAM sites, nearly 100 Israeli jets swarmed into the Bekaa Valley\nand attacked Syria’s air defenses in eastern Lebanon. When a second wave\nscreamed in an hour later, the Syrians sent up their Soviet-made MiGs to\nintercept them. Forty-one Syrian planes were shot down. Seventeen of the 19\nSAM batteries were destroyed by the end of the day. The other two were taken\nout the next morning, and another 43 Syrian jets shot down.\nThere was no longer any pretence about our war aim: to fight our way\nthrough any resistance and reach the Beirut-Damascus road. But after the Bekaa\nair battle, and the most serious air losses for an Arab state since 1967, Yanoush\nand I knew that international pressure for a cease-fire would quickly escalate.\nAware we were racing against the clock, we began a co-ordinated push\ntowards the Beirut-Damascus road. The left arm of our “pincer” was ordered to\nmake its way toward a town called Jobb Janine. It was still some distance from\nthe Damascus road, but an important way-station: Syrian headquarters on the\nwestern side of the Bekaa Valley. The eastern part of our pincer, the 252 nd\n198\nDivision, advanced up the Bekaa, alongside the Syrian border, toward the town\nof Yanta, across from Jobb Jannine.\nBut as it was making its way there, we got word a cease-fire had been\nagreed. It was set for noon the next day, Friday, June 11. The main focus of our\nadvance shifted to a crossroads a few miles east of Jobb Janine. It was a flat,\nopen area surrounded by hills, codenamed the Tovlano Triangle on our maps.\nWe knew we would meet some Syrian resistance. On the way up the valley,\nwe’d seen signs of reinforcements from inside Syria. But we had overwhelming\nsuperiority in tanks, artillery and infantry in the area, as well as full control of\nthe air. In our command post, about five miles back from our frontline forces,\nYanoush set in motion the plan for a pre-cease-fire advance to take the hills\noverlooking the Tovlano Triangle. It was still about eight miles short of the\nBeirut-Damascus road. But the idea was to establish a more secure defensive\nposition by the time the truce took effect, and to put us in position to advance\nfurther if the cease-fire collapsed or was delayed.\nShortly before sunset, Yanoush left by helicopter for a field commanders’\nmeeting with Raful in northern Israel. That left me in charge, alongside\nYanoush’s de facto chief-of-staff, Amram Mitzna. A decorated veteran of 1967\nand 1973 whom I knew well, Amram had the added distinction of being disliked\nby Raful almost as much as I was. Our main reserve division had been ordered\nto take control over the hills south of the Tovlano Triangle. One of its brigades,\nled by a former Sayeret Matkal soldier named Nachman Rifkind, was sent to\ntake up a position immediately south of the triangle. Soon after nightfall,\nRifkind radioed in that he was there, and that the area seemed clear of enemy\nforces. The divisional command post then ordered a second brigade to move\ntoward the hills dominating the crossroads.\nThe first sign of trouble came around midnight. From our overall command\npost, we were listening in on all radio traffic, and heard the second brigade\nreport that it had come under fire while moving toward the crossroads. At first,\nwe assumed it must be from the remnants of a retreating Syrian unit. But\nRifkind, who had reported the area was clear, now said that he could see flashes\nof shellfire two or three miles to his north. Only the following morning did it\nbecome clear that he had not deployed immediately south of the triangle as\nplanned. He had mistakenly halted at a hill about two miles short of there.\nBy the time Yanoush returned to the command post a little after midnight,\nwe were facing another problem. The battalion nearest to the south of the\ntriangle had spotted a dozen large vehicles armed with missiles a few hundred\n199\nyards ahead. The missiles seemed to be pointed north, away from them. But the\nbattalion commander was asking us for permission to open fire.\n“Do not open fire,” I was saying as Yanoush arrived. “I repeat: do not open\nfire.” When Yanoush asked me what was going on, I told him the lead unit had\nreported unknown vehicles with missiles and wanted to know whether it could\nattack. “Tell them yes,” Yanoush said. I looked first at him, then at Mitzna. “We\ncan’t,” I said. “It’s dark. The situation is confused. We don’t know whose\nmissiles these are. It doesn’t make sense they’d be Syrian, just sitting there,\npointed north. At least give it a few minutes.” I think Yanoush would have\ngrabbed the microphone and told the unit to fire had not Amram been there as\nwell. Together, we convinced him to hold off. I ordered the brigade commander\nto get one of the battalion’s APC crews to go out on foot and get as near as\npossible to the missiles. It was nearly 15 minutes later when they returned. They\nsaid they’d never seen this kind of missile vehicle, but that the soldiers manning\nthem seemed to be speaking Hebrew. It turned out to be a new ground-toground\nmissile, not yet formally in service, which had been sent into Lebanon\nwithout our knowledge by the northern command.\nWhile that trouble was averted, much worse lay ahead. Yanoush asked to be\nbrought up to date on our progress in taking control of the area around the\nTovlano Triangle. We briefed him on the situation as we understood it: that\nRifkind had reported the triangle was clear, but that the second brigade had still\nnot reached it. Yanoush tried to radio the divisional commanders. When he\ncouldn’t raise them, he ordered the brigade and battalion commanders to pick\nup their pace and move forward.\nWith Yanoush back and the advance resumed, I tried to grab at least a few\nhours’ sleep. But around 3:45 am, a junior officer shook me awake. When I\nrejoined Yanoush and Amram, they told me the lead battalion was now in deep\ntrouble. It was led by Ira Ephron, one of Dan Shomron’s best company\ncommanders during the 1973 war. For reasons I’ve never been able to establish,\nIra’s orders were not to take the hills south of the triangle as we’d planned, but\nto go through it to a point two miles or so north. Minutes after crossing the\ntriangle, his tanks came under heavy fire. Hoping to escape, he kept going, only\nto find himself surrounded by a Syrian armored force. They were trapped near a\nvillage called Sultan Yacoub, nearly three miles north of Tovlano. Since it was\nearly June, it would be light soon, and his predicament could only get worse.\nAt dawn, he reported he was under heavy artillery, anti-tank missile, RPG\nand close-range rifle fire. The only realistic hope was to retreat. We were unable\n200\nto get air support, but the commander of our artillery force called in all available\nunits, and they drew a kind of protective box of shellfire around Ira’s men as\nthey moved back. We sent our other reserve division towards the crossroads to\nprovide support, and Amram went with them to co-ordinate the operation. But\nIra still had to fight his way out. It was 15 minutes of hell. By the time he\nreached safety at around nine in the morning, he’d lost ten tanks and nearly 20\nmen, four of them during the final, frantic retreat. Five more were missing. The\nreserve division also found itself in a fierce firefight with the Syrians, and lost\neleven men.\nWe were now just three hours from the cease-fire. We did advance nearer to\nthe Beirut-Damascus road. An hour before noon, our dedicated anti-tank unit\ndestroyed 20 of Assad’s top-tier tanks, Soviet-made T-72s. Under different\ncircumstances, those successes might have been a cause for consolation. Yet it\nwas hard to dwell on them given what had happened north of Tovlano. After the\nwar, Sultan Yacoub created fertile ground for conspiracy theories, half-truths\nand finger-pointing. That there had been many oversights and errors was clear,\nthough there was never a full and formal debriefing process to identify in detail\nwhat had gone wrong. I found it deeply frustrating that, unlike in 1973 when I’d\nbeen in a battlefield command role, I was now at several steps removed from\nwhat was happening on the ground. But everyone involved shared responsibility\nfor the failures – including the overall commanders: Yanoush, and me as well.\nThat weight felt even heavier because the tragedy occurred only hours before\nour own force’s involvement in the Lebanon War was over.\n* * *\nIt was not, however, the end of the war. The cease-fire held only\nintermittently in the rest of Lebanon, barely at all in some areas. Freed from\nfighting in our sector, Yanoush, Amram and I began spending time with units\nelsewhere. A couple of days after the cease-fire, I found myself alongside a pair\nof generals, Uri Simchoni and Yossi Ben-Hannan, south of Beirut. In front of\nus, troops from the Golani Brigade were completing their takeover of Beirut\nairport. “You were right,” I told Uri and Yossi. They had been in charge of the\nsimulation exercise in the kirya, predicting how Arik’s ostensibly more limited\ninvasion plan would inevitably develop into Big Pines. Even as we were talking,\n201\nanother Israeli unit broke through to the Beirut-Damascus road. On the far side\nof Lebanon’s capital city, they linked up with Bashir Gemayel’s Phalangists.\nI remember a mix of feelings at the time. Partly, amazement that through\nsheer determination and political maneuvering, Arik seemed to have pulled off\nhis grand plan – or at least the Lebanon part of it. Yes, we’d ended up fighting a\nkind of half-war against the Syrians which, though we’d won it, still left 30,000\nof Assad’s men in Lebanon. And they showed no signs of leaving. Our main\nstrategic threat north of the border was not, in fact, the Palestinians. Syria was\nin military control of Lebanon and, after the peace with Egypt, our most\npowerful adversary. And no matter what Big Pines might have achieved, it\nseemed to clear to me that the Syrians would be free simply to replace the\nweaponry we’d destroyed and fight another day.\nIn Arik’s mind, Bashir Gemayel would soon be in a position to fix that. But\nbeyond my skepticism from having met some of his boy officers in Tel Aviv, I\ncouldn’t see how that would work. I strained to imagine Gemayel daring to\nform what would amount to a formal alliance with Israel and ordering the\nSyrian troops to leave. And given what would be at stake for Damascus, I\ncertainly couldn’t see the Phalangists being able to drive them out by force.\nThe more immediate, open question involved Arafat and the Palestinians.\nOur other two invasion forces had driven almost all the PLO fighters out of\nsouth Lebanon, though not without costs and casualties. Most of the\nPalestinians, however, had retreated north to their de facto capital, the\nsouthwestern neighborhoods of Beirut. The idea of a ground assault – street-tostreet\nbattles in an area packed with fighters, weapons and tens of thousands of\ncivilians – didn’t bear thinking about. After the war, some of the officers around\nBeirut said Arik seemed to hoping that the Phalangist milita would go into the\noverwhelmingly Muslim western side of Beirut. At one point, he was even\nconsidering an Israeli attack. Fortunately, given the Phalangists’ record of\nviolence bordering on savagery during the Lebanese civil war, Bashir Gemayel\nwasn’t willing to send them in. As for an Israeli assault, Begin’s ministers\nweren’t ready to sign off on it, and the Americans let it be know, repeatedly,\nthat they were vehemently opposed to the idea.\nArik again turned to a fallback plan. He knew that Begin did share his\ndetermination to get Arafat and the PLO out of Lebanon. Even the Americans\nwere ready to support such an arrangement, assuming it could be negotiated and\nimplemented in a way that would bring the fighting to an end. Whether by\nintent or political fortune, the mere prospect of Arik further expanding the\n202\ninvasion had the effect of persuading Washington to send Philip Habib back\ninto the diplomatic fray. With no early sign, however, of Arafat agreeing to\nleave, Arik now steadily tightened what amounted to a siege on west Beirut. For\nseven weeks in July and August, our forces pounded the PLO-controlled\nneighborhoods from land, air and sea; intermittently cut water and electricity\nsupplies; and hoped that the accumulated pressure, and casualties, would force\nArafat and his men to agree to Habib’s terms for a wholesale evacuation.\nBy this point, I was spending most of my time in the kirya, with periodic\nvisits north, sometimes with Arik or Raful, to our positions on the eastern,\nPhalangist-controlled, side of Beirut. On several occasions, I helicoptered back\nwith Habib or his deputy, Morris Draper. In one instance, I accompanied Draper\ninto a meeting with Arik. In what I imagine had become a familiar, and\nfrustrating, part of the US mediation mission, he pressed Arik to rein in our\nbombardments, arguing that we were in danger of ruining the chances of getting\na negotiated deal on Arafat’s leaving. Arik argued straight back. His view was\nthat unless the PLO felt squeezed into submission, they would stay put.\nOn that, I thought Arik was probably right. Other Israeli generals with far\nmore experience, and weight, also seemed to agree. Notably, Yitzhak Rabin. He\nwas no longer in government, nor even in charge of Labor. But he had always\nhad a soft spot for Arik, as did Sharon for him. With uneasiness, questions and\noutright criticism of the siege building both internationally and inside Israel,\nArik got Rabin to helicopter north with him to Beirut. Yitzhak spent six or\nseven hours there. His verdict on the siege, at least as reported in the Israeli\npress, was more than Arik could have hoped for. Lehadek, he said. “Tighten it.”\nIn the end, I’m convinced the siege did have a critical effect on getting the\nevacuation deal. But unleashing our single most relentless series of air attacks,\non August 12, when the deal was basically done, seemed both perverse and\nexcessive, and not just to me. Habib, and President Reagan himself, fumed. So\ndid a lot of Begin’s own ministers, with the result, unprecedented in Israeli\nmilitary annals, that they formally removed Arik’s authority to decide on future\nair force missions. That turned out not to matter, however, because August 12\neffectively marked the end of the siege.\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, August 21, the first shipload of an eventual\ntotal of nearly 10,000 Palestinian fighters left Beirut harbor for Cyprus, and then\nfor a variety of new host countries. On this score at least, Arik’s grand design\nhad proven beyond him: the Palestinians were not bound for Jordan. By far\nmost of them headed for the PLO’s new political base, the north African state of\n203\nTunisia. Arafat himself left on August 30.\nStill, as the evacuation proceeded, another one of Arik’s central aims in Big\nPines was also achieved. On August 23, the Lebanese parliament elected Bashir\nGemayel as the country’s new president.\n* * *\nDuring the several weeks that followed, there was a confident feeling among\nArik and his inner circle in the kirya. To the extent that Arik and Raful saw any\ncloud on the horizon, it was their concern about “several thousand” Palestinian\nfighters who they were certain had stayed on in Beirut despite the evacuation.\nTrue, Bashir Gemayel hadn’t been formally inaugurated as president. There had\nbeen reports that he was privately assuring Lebanese Muslim leaders that he\nwould be conciliatory once he took office, and that he was not about to consider\na formal peace with Israel. He had also been resisting Israeli efforts to make an\nearly, public show of friendship, such as an official visit to meet Prime Minister\nBegin. But there was an undisguised hope that this was just a brief political\nhiatus, for appearance’s sake, and that before too long Lebanon would become\nthe second Arab country to make peace with Israel. Not just peace, but\nsomething more nearly like an alliance.\nThough I still looked through the eyes of an army officer, not a politician\nand certainly not an experienced diplomat, I had serious doubts this would\nhappen. Simple logic seemed to suggest that, since Gemayel knew we had no\nrealistic option of turning our back on him, his political interests were best\nserved by keeping his distance and trying to build bridges at home. But on the\nearly evening of September 14, nine days before his scheduled inauguration, not\njust that question but the whole new political edifice Arik had envisaged in\nlaunching the invasion, became suddenly, irretrievably, irrelevant.\nI was at my desk on the third floor of the kirya, getting ready to go home,\nwhen the news broke: a huge bomb had exploded at the Phalangist Party\nheadquarters in east Beirut as Gemayel was beginning to address hundreds of\nsupporters. For a while, the reports from Beirut suggested that Gemayel had\nsurvived the blast, but shortly before eleven at night the confirmation came: the\npresident-elect was dead.\n204\nThough no one claimed responsibility, there was no shortage of suspects.\nDuring and since the civil war, Gemayel had at various times been at odds with\na whole array of enemies or rivals: Muslim militias, the PLO, other Maronite\nfactions and, of course, the Syrians. But I think for all of us, even Arik, the issue\nof who was behind the bombing was hardly the most urgent concern. The\nimmediate danger was a revival of the kind of rampant bloodletting Lebanon\nhad endured in the civil war. The day after the assassination, I joined a halfdozen\nother members of the general staff and helicoptered up to the Lebanese\ncapital. Arik, ignoring weeks of US pressure not to do so, had already ordered\nIsraeli troops into west Beirut – not to fight, but to take control of key junctions\nand vantage points and keep basic order.\nBut the question obviously on everyone’s mind was how to make sure the\nsituation remained under control. It was early afternoon when we reached an\nIsraeli command post in the largely Palestinian southwest part of the city. It was\nset up by Amos Yaron, the former paratroop commander whose division had\nlanded by sea at the start of the invasion and was part of the push north to the\ncapital. At his side was Amir Drori, the head of the northern command. They\nhad set up a rooftop observation post just a few hundred yards in from where I\nhad landed with my Sayeret Matkal team a decade earlier for the Rue Verdun\noperation. It overlooked a pair of Palestinian refugee camps: Sabra and, a\ncouple of hundred yards closer to us, Shatila.\nRaful was with us as well. So was Moshe Levy, the deputy chief-of-staff,\nand Uri Saguy, the head of the operations branch in the kirya. I listened rather\nthan spoke. All I could gather from the other generals’ conversation was that\nthey were trying to figure out how to handle the Palestinian camps. No one\nexplicitly mentioned the idea of Israeli troops going in, presumably because\nthey realized that, far from helping ensure order, that might well inflame things\nfurther. Even Raful, at least in my earshot, made no reference to the “several\nthousand” PLO fighters that he and Arik still wanted out of Beirut. The only\nnote that struck me as odd was a general agreement that the Phalangists had not\nbeen carrying their load of the fighting during the war. One comment in\nparticular stuck with me, though I didn’t take it as referring to the Palestinian\ncamps in particular. I can’t remember which general said it, only that everyone\nseemed to agree: “Why the hell do we have to do their fighting for them?”\nIt was not until the next morning, back in Tel Aviv, that the alarm bells rang\nfor me, and by then it turned out to be too late. It was Friday, the eve of the\nJewish New Year. Yet in the wake of Gemayel’s assassination, the kirya was\n205\ncrowded. I heard the first rumors from a staff officer in military intelligence,\nthough neither he nor anyone else I asked was sure if they were true. But it\nseemed that the Phalangists had been sent into Sabra and Shatila. And that they\nhad begun killing people.\nI’d like to think that, in Amos Yaron’s or Amir Dori’s place, I’d have been\nsufficiently wise not to have allowed the Phalangists into the camps in the first\nplace. But the truth is that I’m not sure. If the decision was to send someone in, I\ncertainly wouldn’t have sent in Israeli troops. But unlike other Israeli generals,\nmy first-hand knowledge of the Phalangists was limited to a single lunchtime\nencounter in Tel Aviv. My impression from that meeting was that they were\noverblown, post-adolescent thugs, not murders. I did, of course, know the\nmilita’s reputation for untrammelled violence in the Lebanese civil war. Still, I\nmight conceivably agreed to have the Phalangists go in – under strict orders to\nlimit themselves to keeping order – in the knowledge that our own troops were\nstationed in the area immediately around the camps.\nYet from the moment of the first rumors – as soon as I heard even the hint\nthat killings were underway – I had not a second’s doubt about what had to be\ndone next: get the Phalangists out. Immediately. I felt a particular urgency\nbecause of the rooftop gripe I’d heard the day before, about our troops having to\ndo their fighting for them. That made me pretty certain that, at the very least, we\nhad indeed sent the Phalangists into the camps.\nI tried to reach Arik, but couldn’t get through to him. I contacted Oded\nShamir, the former intelligence officer who was his main liaison with the army.\nI told him that if the Phalangists were inside the camps, he had to urge Arik to\nget them out. Then I called Tsila Drori, Amir’s wife. I asked whether she’d\nspoken to him that morning. She said no. He’d called her the day before,\nhowever, and she was sure he’d be in touch before the New Year. “Please,\nswear to me, Tsila, you’ll give him a message,” I said. “I was there yesterday.\nTell him please do whatever he can to stop this action. It will end very, very\nbadly.” I told her he would know what I meant.\nIt was too late to stop it altogether. The slaughter – the round-ups and the\nbeatings and the killings of Palestinians in the two camps – had indeed begun\nthe night before. Amir found out about it late on Friday morning. Not from me,\nI believe, but from his staff officers. He ordered the Phalangists to stop. But\nthey didn’t. No one in command acted, at least successfully, to make sure that\nthe militiamen got out of the camps. The atrocities went on. It was another 24\nhours before the militamen finally withdrew.\n206\nOne night’s massacre would have been enough to produce the outcry that\nresulted once the first news reports, photos and TV pictures were sent around\nthe world. That the bloodletting was allowed to continue after we knew what\nwas going on, beyond the cost in innocent lives, made the fallout even worse. In\nIsrael, the response was unlike anything in the past. There had been some\nopposition to the war: from parts of Labor, from political groups further to the\nleft and particularly the pressure group Peace Now, formed in 1978 to protest\nthe Begin government’s obvious desire to use the peace with Egypt as a means\nto limit, rather than actively explore, prospects for a wider agreement with the\nPalestinians.\nAfter Sabra and Shatila, Peace Now was the driving force behind demands\nfor an inquiry into the Israeli role into what had happened. But the trauma went\ndeeper. Israelis of all political stripes jammed shoulder-to-shoulder into the\nKings of Israeli Square in the heart of Tel Aviv a week after the massacre.\nThere were soldiers, too: 20somethings back from the fighting and reservists a\ndecade or more older. Some estimates put the size of the crowd at as many as\n400,000, almost ten percent of the population of Israel at the time. The protest\nwas nominally aimed at forcing the government to empower a commission of\ninquiry, which it did a couple of days later. But the mood in the square was\nmore like an outpouring of shock and shame. While the catalyst was the\nmassacre in the camps, it tapped into a rumble of growing questions, and\ndoubts, about the war itself, which had been building ever since the prolonged\nsiege of west Beirut: what the invasion was for, how it had been planned and\nprosecuted, and what it said about our country, our government and our armed\nforces.\nI was at home with Nava, watching the coverage of the demonstration on\ntelevision. I shared the protesters’ view that an inquiry was needed. In the days\nsince my phone call to Tsila Drori, I’d remained troubled not just by our failure\nto stop the killings once we knew what was going on, but by the response from\nBegin, Arik and some other ministers to the massacre. Determined to shift the\nblame and responsibility elsewhere, they kept driving home the point that it was\nPhalangists, not Israelis, who had carried out the killings. That was true. But it\ncould not erase the failures of judgment and control on our part. We were the\nones who had allowed them into the camps. Our forces were deployed around\nthe perimeter. And the killers were our “Lebanese Christian allies”.\nThe formal picking-apart of Israel’s share of responsibility would be the job\nof the inquiry commission. I did take some heart from the very fact such large\n207\nnumbers of Israelis, and ultimately the government, had ensured a truly\nindependent probe would now go ahead.\nBut other ways in which the war had gone wrong were already glaringly\napparent. Some were operational. It is true we ended up overcoming Palestinian\nand Syrian resistance. Given the numerical balance of forces, that was a\nforegone conclusion. But with all the attention paid to the political aims of the\ninvasion, we’d never sufficiently planned for operating against a wholly\ndifferent kind of enemy than in our previous wars, and on a wholly different\nkind of terrain. Huge columns of Israeli armor had found themselves stuck on\nthe winding roads of central Lebanon, running low on gasoline, vulnerable to\nrelatively small ambush squads. In some instances, a dozen Palestinian fighters\nor Syrian commandos had halted the best-armed, best-trained, tank forces in the\nMiddle East for hours on end. Overall, the pattern of past wars had been broken.\nEven in 1973, once the surprise attacks had been turned back, Israeli forces had\nadvanced, attacked and broken enemy resistance. That hadn’t happened here.\nThere was a deeper problem as well. At the start of the conflict, Begin had\ndeclared, boastfully almost, that this was Israel’s first “war of choice.” That\nwasn’t true. Both 1956 and 1967 were wars of choice. Yet those preemptive\nattacks, especially in the Six-Day War, were in response to a sense of strategic\nthreat that was commonly understood by almost all Israelis. There was a sense\nnot just of consensus, but national unity. This war was different. It had been\nlaunched in pursuit of a specific political vision: a marriage of Begin’s political\ncredo and Arik’s determination to use overwhelming force to bulldoze a new\npolitical reality in Lebanon.\nThe findings of the inquiry commission were published in February 1983.\nThey were all the more powerful for the forensic language used. The inquiry did\nconcede Begin’s point: it was Gemayel’s men who had actually done the\nkilling. But it said that the Israeli commanders’ decision to allow the\nPhalangists into the refugee camps “was taken without consideration of the\ndanger – which the makers and executors of the decision were obligated to\nforesee as probable – that the Phalangists would commit massacres.” The\ncommission added that “when the reports began to arrive about the actions of\nthe Phalangists in the camps, no proper heed was taken. The correct conclusions\nwere not drawn. No energetic and immediate action was taken to restrain the\nPhalangists and put a stop to their actions.”\nArik bore personal responsibility for this, the report said. So did Raful, and\nthe head of military intelligence, Yehoshua Saguy. The commission\n208\nrecommended that Begin fire Sharon and Saguy. They left Raful in place, but\nonly because his term as chief-of-staff was due to end in a matter of weeks. Arik\nat first refused to go, and Begin refused to fire him. Yet in the end, popular\npressure forced the issue. When another demonstration was called in protest at\nSharon’s continuing as Defense Minister, a right-wing political activist tossed a\ngrenade into the crowd, killing a young Peace Now member. Even Arik was\nevidently shaken by the spectre of one of his presumed political admirers\nmurdering a fellow Israeli for peacefully protesting. Or at least shaken enough\nto step down as Defense Minister. He did remain in the government as a\nminister without portfolio. Still, Begin himself would quit as Prime Minister,\nretiring into virtual seclusion, about half-a-year later.\nLike the rest of the senior officers corps, I tried with difficulty to get on with\nmy own job. I imagined the contribution I could best make for now would be, as\nHead of Planning, to ensure the mix of forces and weaponry deployed in any\nfuture conflict were better suited to the task than in the Lebanon war. But I\ndidn’t believe that such technical failings or planning lapses, however serious a\ncontribution to the more than 650 Israeli lives lost, were what had mainly\ncaused the war to go wrong. The central mistake was what had bothered me all\nalong: the invasion was not a considered response to a particular security threat.\nIt was an overreaching exercise in geopolitics, with sleight-of-hand used to\nevade the need to make and win support from government ministers and,\ncritically, the public. Even with questions still to be resolved about when and\nhow to withdraw the thousands of Israeli troops that were still inside Lebanon, I\nremember wondering aloud to a few army friends, and to Nava as well, whether\nwe would look back in a decade’s time and see the war as “our Vietnam”. In\nfact, Israeli troops would still be in south Lebanon nearly two decades later,\nwhen I had left the military and was about to become Israeli Prime Minister.\nEven as a two-star general in the kirya, I doubted I would be in a position to\nhelp fix the deeper issues raised by the war. Any real influence would be in\npositions like the chief-of-staff and his deputy; the head of operations; the head\nof military intelligence. They were the core of the armed forces’ leadership and\nhad the most regular dealings with senior figures in government.\nBut I’d failed to factor in the effect of the inquiry recommendations. Within\ndays of the report, Israel had a new Defense Minister: Moshe Arens, who\nreturned from his post as ambassador in Washington. Among his first orders of\nbusiness was to act on the inquiry’s verdict on Raful and Yehoshua Saguy. As\nchief of staff, Arens settled on a choice I suspect most senior officers saw as the\n209\nright man for the moment: Raful’s deputy, Moshe Levy. Well over six feet tall,\nhe was known as Moshe Vechetzi. “Moshe-and-a-Half.” He was reserved and\nsoft-spoken, a safe pair of hands after the trauma of the war.\nBut Arens also had to name a successor to Saguy as head of military\nintelligence. And for that job, he nominated me.\n210\nChapter Thirteen\nIt was a huge responsibility, and not just because I was suddenly in charge of\nan intelligence apparatus ranging from Unit 8200, our sophisticated signals\ncollection and decryption unit, to the operational units like Sayeret Matkal. It\nwas what was at stake if things went wrong: success or failure in war, and the\nlife or death of thousands of men on the battlefield. It was a price we’d paid\npainfully in 1973. And now again, just nine years later, in Lebanon.\nIf I needed any reminder, it was conveniently placed on my new office wall:\nthe photographs of each of my nine predecessors since 1948 as Head of the\nIntelligence Directorate, or Rosh Aman in Hebrew. All had come to the role\nwith talent and dedication. All but three had either left under a shadow, or been\nfired. Sometimes this was because of ultimately non-fatal lapses, like a botched\nmobilization of our reserves in 1959, or the Rotem crisis a few months later.\nSometimes, it was due to lethal failures like the Yom Kippur War and Lebanon.\nI went to see all eight former directors who were still alive. “You know, I\nused to read the newspapers and listen to the BBC in the car to work,” Shlomo\nGazit told me. He was the director I’d worked for in operational intelligence,\nthe one who’d so memorably made the point that we might endanger Israeli\nsecurity not only be missing the signs of a war, but signs of an opportunity for\npeace. He was also one of the few to have left office without blemish. “By the\ntime I got to the kirya, I already knew 80 percent of what I could about what\nwas going on,” he said. “Then I’d spend six or seven hours reading intelligence\nmaterial, to fill in at least part of the remaining 20 percent.” His message,\nechoed by my other predecessors, was that the job wasn’t mainly about the raw\ninformation. It was what you concluded from the information, what you did\nwith it. It was about judgement.\nThe intelligence did matter, of course. For all of Israel’s strengths in that\narea, I knew from my own experience at Sultan Yacoub that there was still\nroom to get more, better, and more timely information about our enemies, and\nmake sure it got to the commanders and field units that needed it. And while the\ndetails of many operations I approved for Sayeret Matkal and other units remain\nclassified, we did succeed in doing that – to take just one example, by finding\nan entirely new way to get intelligence from inside Syrian command posts.\nYet above all, I set out to apply the lessons of the 1973 and 1982 wars. In\nrereading the official inquiry reports, I saw that the intelligence failings had\n211\nbeen different in each of them. In the Yom Kippur War, the problem was not\njust Eli Zeira’s failure to activate the sayeret’s listening devices in Eygpt,\ndeeply damaging though that was. It was judgement. Inside Aman, a kind of\ngroupthink had taken hold. It was rooted in a confident, costly misconception\nwhich went unchallenged: that Egypt would never risk another war without an\nair force capable of breaching our defences and striking towns and cities deep\ninside Israel. No one pressed the alternative scenario: that Sadat might strike\nwith more limited territorial objectives and, under cover of his SAM batteries\non the other side of the Suez Canal, advance into the Sinai.\nIn the Lebanon war, the inquiry suggested, Yehoshua Saguy did try to warn\nthe generals, and the government, about major risks. But individual ministers\ntestified that they hadn’t heard, hadn’t been there, or hadn’t understood, leading\nthe inquiry to stress the responsibility of a Rosh Aman to ensure not just that his\nmessage was conveyed, but that it was received as well.\nI set out to address both problems. Inside the department, I insisted on\nmaking all our preconceptions open to challenge. I set up a unit whose sole\nfunction was to play devil’s advocate when a consensus was reached. It began\nwith the opposite conclusion and, through a competing analysis of the data, and\nlogical argument, tried to prove it. I also wanted to be challenged on my\npreconceptions. I assigned a bright young major as my personal intelligenceand-analysis\naide. He read everything that crossed my desk and could access\nany material in the department. “You have no responsibility to agree with any of\nthe analysts, or with me,” I said. “Part of your job is to disagree.”\nIn the Lebanon war, Saguy had faced an additional problem. He was\nexcluded from some government meetings at which crucial decisions were\nmade. That was out of his control. I didn’t want it to be out mine. I raised the\nissue with Begin in our first meeting. “If you want to get the maximum value\nfrom your head of intelligence,” I said, “you should make sure he’s there not\njust after, but when decisions are made.” Yet he was now only months from\nleaving office, exhausted by the war and its aftermath. He waved his hand\nweakly in response, as if to say none of it mattered. His successor, in October\n1983, was Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Ideologically, he was cut from the\nsame cloth: an advocate from the 1940s of securing a Jewish state in all of\nPalestine, by whatever force necessary. He’d broken with Begin’s pre-state\nIrgun militia to set up a group called Lehi, which went further and carried out\npolitical assassinations: the 1944 killing of Lord Moyne, Britain’s Minister for\n212\nMiddle East Affairs, and four years later the United Nations envoy, Count Folke\nBernadotte.\n“Why are you so strident,” Shamir asked me, only half-jokingly, after I’d\ninsisted on joining a government discussion and pressing several intelligence\nmatters. “It’s because I’ve read the Lebanon inquiry,” I replied. “I saw what\nhappened when a message isn’t delivered assertively. I’m not going to be in the\nposition of making the same mistakes.” He nodded, and didn’t raise it again.\nIn fact, it was under Shamir that I began to get more involved with political\nand policy issues beyond the armed forces. Part of this came with the job of\nRosh Aman. There was hardly a major domestic or foreign challenge that did\nnot have some security component, and no security matter on which intelligence\nwas not critical. But I also found myself working more closely with leading\npoliticians: mainly Shamir and Misha Arens, who as defense minister was my\nmain point of contact. Since I was a Labor kibbutznik, we made an odd\nthreesome. Arens was also a lifelong Jabotinsky Zionist. He had been in the\nBetar youth movement in America, before going to Palestine in 1948 and\njoining the Irgun. In fact, it was with Misha’s personal backing that one of my\nformer Sayeret Matkal officers – the son of a Jabotinsky acolyte – had recently\ntaken his first steps into the political limelight. After a two-year stint as Israel’s\nnumber-two diplomat in Washington, Bibi Netanyahu had become our\nambassador to the United Nations.\nWith both Arens and Shamir, I built a solid relationship, based on mutual\nrespect, and it would deepen further when I moved on to a wider role in the\nkirya a few years later. They were straight talkers. While resolute about\ndecisions once they’d taken them, they were genuinely open to discussion and\ndebate. I also sometimes found a surprising degree of nuance behind their tough\nexterior.\nThe toughness was there, however. One of the first major security crises we\nfaced after Shamir became Prime Minister was known as the Kav 300 affair,\nnamed for the bus route between the southern port city of Ashdod and Tel Aviv.\nOn the evening of April 12, 1984, four Palestinians from Gaza boarded the bus\nand hijacked it back toward the border with Egypt. They told the passengers they\nwere armed with knives, and that a suitcase which one of them was carrying\ncontained unexploded anti-tank shells. After a high-speed chase, an Israeli army\nunit managed to shoot out the tires and disable the vehicle, when it was still\nabout ten miles short of Gaza. One of the passengers had been severely injured at\n213\nthe start. A number of others managed to escape when the bus was stopped. But\nseveral dozen remained inside.\nI was in Europe at the time, on one of my periodic trips to discuss Middle\nEast issues with a fellow intelligence chief. Yet an aide called me with the news.\nI was several thousand miles away from what happening. But I knew there was\nevery possibility Sayeret Matkal might be called in, and my instincts told me we\nshould proceed with caution. The situation we were facing felt nothing like\nSabena, much less Entebbe. Here, we had a single bus. Our troops, and in fact\neveryone from ministers and officials to reporters and photographers, were in a\nloose cordon a couple of dozen yards away. That said to me there was no sense\nthat the hijackers posed an immediate danger. Nor did they seem to have come\nequipped for a major confrontation. In place of the AK-47s and grenades we’d\nseen in previous terror attacks, these guys had knives, and, if they were to be\nbelieved, a couple of shells with no obvious way to detonate them.\nI phoned a friend in the command post set up near the stranded bus. He told\nme that Misha and Moshe Vechetzi were there. There was a standoff with the\nterrorists and, for now, it was quiet. The defense minister and the chief-of-staff,\nof course, did not need my presence, much less my agreement, to order the\nsayeret into action. But I said: why not wait? Though the last flights back to\nIsrael had already left, I could be at the command post by mid-morning. Beyond\nwanting to be present if the sayeret was ordered in, I believed the crisis might\neven be brought to an end without another shot being fired. “I’ll tell them what\nyou said,” my friend replied. “But I doubt it’ll be allowed to drag on much past\ndaybreak.”\nHe was right. With my Chinese Farm comrade Yitzhik Mordechai in overall\ncommand, Sayeret Matkal stormed the bus at about seven in the morning. They\nshot and killed two of the hijackers immediately, through the vehicle’s windows.\nSadly one of the passengers, a young woman soldier, died in the assault, but the\nrest of the hostages were freed, none with serious injuries.\nA controversy soon erupted over what came next. The sayeret commandos\nhad captured the other two terrorists alive and uninjured. Yet barely a week later,\nfirst in an American newspaper and then the Israeli media, reports emerged that\nthe two surviving Palestinians had been killed after the hijacking was over. A\nyear later, Yitzhik Mordechai was – wrongly – put on trial for his alleged part in\nwhat had amounted to a summary execution. And, rightly, exonerated. Though\nthe full details never became public, the people responsible turned out to be from\nthe Shin Bet, our equivalent of the FBI.\n214\nWeeks later, Misha Arens mentioned Kav 300 in one of our regular meetings.\nIt was not so much a statement of what should or shouldn’t have happened, but a\nshow of genuine puzzlement. “How can it be,” he asked, “when there is a real\nfight, an operation in which our soldiers are shooting, that terrorists come out\nalive?” The answer, to me, was simple: Sayeret Matkal. From our earliest days,\nthere was an understanding that you used whatever force necessary in order to\nmake an operation successful. Yet once the aim had been achieved – in this case,\neliminating the danger to the passengers – it was over. I am convinced, by the\nway, that Misha didn’t actually order the sayeret, or anyone else, to kill all the\nterrorists. I’m equally convinced there was a tacit assumption on the ground that\nMisha’s view, and Shamir’s as well, was that this would be no bad thing.\n* * *\nYet by the summer of 1984, Shamir and Arens appeared in danger of losing\ntheir jobs. Israel’s next election, the first since the Lebanon war, was due in\nJuly. Just as the trauma of the 1973 war had helped Begin end Likud’s three\ndecades in opposition, the polls and the pundits were now suggesting that\nShimon Peres might bring Labor back to power. There was no prospect he’d\nwin an outright majority in the 120-seat Knesset. No one had ever done that, not\neven Ben-Gurion in his political heyday. From 1948, Israel’s political landscape\nhad been populated by at least a dozen-or-so parties, mostly a reflection of the\nvarious Zionist and religious groups before the state was established. The\ndominant party always needed to make deals with some of the smaller ones to\nget the required 60-vote parliamentary majority and form a government.\nThe Likud looked vulnerable. Domestic concerns, alone, were eroding its\nsupport. Under Begin’s turbo-charged version of Milton Freedman economics,\nan economic boom had given way to runaway inflation and a stock market\ncrash. Lebanon, however, was the main issue, and it remained a running\npolitical sore. The assassinated Bashir Gemayel’s brother, Amin Gemayel, had\nbecome president. But Israel still had large numbers of troops there. And while\nmost of the PLO fighters had gone, we faced a new and potentially even more\nintractable enemy in the south of the country. When our invasion began, the\narea’s historically disadvantaged Shi’ite Muslim majority had been the one\ngroup besides the Christians with the prospect of benefiting. The PLO rocket\nand artillery bases had disrupted their lives and, worse, placed them in the line\n215\nof our retaliatory fire. Some of the Shi’ite villages in the south even greeted our\ninvading units with their traditional welcome, showering them with rice. But for\na new Shi’ite militia calling itself Hizbollah – formed after the invasion and\ninspired by the Ayatollah Khomeini’s revolution in Iran – our continuing\nmilitary presence was anathema. In November 1983, Hizbollah signalled its\nintentions when a truck bomber drove into a building being used as our military\nheadquarters in the south Lebanese city of Tyre, killing more than 60 people.\nYet the election ended up as a near-tie. Peres did lead Labor back into top\nspot for the first time since Begin’s victory in 1977. But he got only 44 seats, to\nthe Likud’s 41. After weeks of horse-trading with smaller parties, he could not\nform a government. Neither could Shamir. The result, for the first time in\npeacetime, was a national-unity coalition, including both main parties. Peres\nwould be Prime Minister for the first two years, and Shamir the final two. But\nthe stipulation of most relevance to me was that one man would be the Defence\nMinister throughout the four years: Yitzhak Rabin.\nMy relationship with Rabin went back much further than with Misha. I’d\nfirst met him when I was a sayeret soldier. I’d interacted with him more as\nsayeret commander, and of course during Entebbe. Now, we began to work\neven more closely, and the main challenge in his early months as Defense\nMinister was what to do about our troops in Lebanon. We had gradually been\npulling back. We were more or less on the 40-kilometer line which Sharon had\nclaimed was the point of the invasion. But even this was costing us lives, with\nno obvious benefit from controlling a large slab of territory on which nearly\nhalf-a-million Lebanese lived. A decision was now reached to shrink our\n“security zone” further, pulling back to the Litani River. It meandered about 25\nkilometers north of the border, and in some areas was even closer to Israel.\nI argued strongly in favor of getting out altogether. I accepted that the\n“Litani line” might help impede cross-border raids. But especially since the\nremaining Palestinian fighters and Hizbollah were acquiring newer Katyushas,\nwith a range of up to 20 kilometers, they could fire rockets over the security\nzone. My deeper concern was that we intended to hold the area with between\n1,000 and 1,500 Israeli troops in open alliance with a local Maronite Christian\nmilitia, called the South Lebanon Army. This would rule out any hope of\nworking out security arrangements with the non-Christian majority in the south.\nI tried to persuade Rabin we should withdraw all the Israeli soldiers and\ncoordinate security arrangements with the equivalent of a local civil-defense\nguard. I suggested four separate militias drawn from the local population –\n216\nChristian, Shi’ite Muslim, Druse and ethnically mixed – with the aim of\nreflecting the balance in each part of the south.\nIsraeli troops might still have to cross into Lebanon, but only for brief,\ntargeted operations to preempt preparations for a terror attack. “We need to\nremember what we’re there for,” I said. “We have no territorial claims. It’s to\nprotect the north of Israel. But it will end up being about protecting our own\ntroops inside the security zone. It will be like the Bar-Lev line in 1973, fighting\nfor fortifications we don’t need.” I couldn’t persuade him. I’m sure he\nunderstood the argument, and he may even have agreed. But when Katyushas\nnext fell on northern Israel, he as Minister of Defense, not I, would be the one in\nthe political firing line.\nFar from straining our relations, our frank exchanges on Lebanon seemed to\nbuild further trust between us. We worked closely on a range of issues. When\nSayeret Matkal or another intelligence unit planned an operation across our\nborders, both of us would present the action to the cabinet. During the\noperations, I’d be either in the kirya or a forward command post. Since nearly\nall of them happened after nightfall, Yitzhak would usually be back home,\nasleep, by the time they ended. I would phone him. The trademark voice – slow,\ngravelly, deep even when he was wide awake – would answer. I’d tell him the\nmission was over and – with only one exception during my period as head of\nintelligence – successful. “Todah,” he would say. “Lehitraot.” Thanks. Bye. He\nwas never a man to waste words.\nFor one of the very few times I can remember, he phoned me one morning in\nOctober 1985. It came a couple of days after an especially gruesome Palestinian\nterror attack. Even with Arafat now more than a thousand miles away in Tunis,\nmuch of Rabin’s focus was taken up in responding to, or trying to preempt,\nPalestinian terrorism. The issue was especially sensitive politically in the wake\nof a war in Lebanon that was supposed to have eliminated that threat. For Rabin,\nmoreover, it had become personal. He’d had to sanction an unprecedented\nexchange of 1,150 Palestinian security prisoners earlier in the year to secure the\nfreedom of three Israeli soldiers, including one of our men from Sultan Yacoub,\nwho had ended up in the hands of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of\nPalestine – General Command. Now a group from another of the radical factions,\nthe Palestine Liberation Front, had hijacked an Italian cruise ship called the\nAchille Lauro en route from Egypt to Israel. They murdered one of the\npassengers, a wheelchair-bound, 69-year-old Jewish American named Leon\nKlinghoffer, and dumped his body overboard.\n217\nRabin’s closest aide, whom I knew well, was aware that Unit 8200 had\nintercepts that laid bare the details, and left no doubt the murderers were from a\nPLO group. He called and asked me to appear on a weekly television interview\nprogram called Moked. It was hosted by Nissim Mishal: brash, incisive, and one\nof Israel’s best-known broadcast journalists. I pointed out to the Rabin aide that\nI’d never done anything like this before. But he insisted it would go well. He\nbriefed me on the questions I could expect, not just about the Achille Lauro but\nthe wider issue of Palestinian attacks, as well as Syrian President Hafez al-\nAssad’s efforts to re-equip his air force after his losses in Lebanon. So I came to\nthe interview prepared. I brought audio tapes of the hijackers, and a large\nphotograph of the MiG-25s which the Syrians were seeking to acquire.\nMy appearance will not go down in the annals of great moments in\ntelevision. But at the time, very few Israelis even knew who I was, and I felt I’d\ndone OK. I was surprised, however, when Rabin phoned the next day. “Ehud, I\ndidn’t see it. I was attending some event,” he said. But his wife, Leah, had\nrecorded the program. “I just watched it. I should tell you, I think it was\nexceptional. You did a great job. It was highly important for us, for the army,\nand, I dare say, for you.”\n* * *\nI was not sure what he meant by saying it might be good for me as well,\nalthough a decade later, at the end of my army career, he would play the central\nrole into my entry into Israeli politics. It is true that there was also some politics\nat the upper reaches of the military as well, especially around the choice of chief\nof staff, and that Moshe Vechetzi’s term had only a year-and-a-half to go. But I\ndidn’t view myself as a serious candidate at this stage. Moshe’s own preference\nseemed to be either Amir Drori, the head of the northern command during the\nLebanon War, or Amnon Lipkin, the veteran paratroop commander who’d been\nwith me on the Rue Verdun raid in Beirut. My own hope was that the nod\nwould go to any even closer friend of mine: Dan Shomron.\nI had first got to know Dan well in the late sixties after Karameh, Israel’s\ncostly standoff with Arafat, when Fatah’s influence was in its infancy. We\nexchanged impressions on what had gone wrong, and why? When I became\ncommander of Sayeret Matkal, we remained in touch, and he took a close\ninterest in all of our operations. We also crossed paths in the Sinai in the 1973,\n218\nin which Dan’s division was key in staunching the Egyptian advance in the first\ndays of the war, later inflicted heavy losses on one of Sadat’s armored forces\nand was part of the final push on the other side of the canal. And, of course,\nduring Entebbe. Dan had sharp tactical instincts, a belief in the importance of\nusing new technology to gain and sustain an edge, and an openness to\nunconventional approaches. Faced with a challenge in planning or executing an\noperation, he looked at it from all sides, determined to come up with the right\napproach, not always the expected one. In a lot of these ways, we were similar,\nwhich was no doubt one reason our relationship had grown closer as he and I –\nsix years younger, and a step or two behind – rose up the ranks.\nIn fact, Dan was the reason I’d made one of my rare forays into kirya politics\nnot long after Moshe Vechetzi took over as chief of staff, when Misha Arens was\nstill Defense Minister. I acted to derail what seemed to me a blatant attempt by\nMoshe to advance Drori’s and Amnon Lipkin’s prospects for eventual\nsuccession as chief-of-staff, and to take Dan out of the contest altogether.\nI was sitting at my desk on the third floor when the chief of internal army\nsecurity, an officer named Ben-Dor, walked into my office. “Listen,” he said,\n“the chief of staff has a right to give me a direct order in cases where he thinks\nthere is a need for a special investigation. But you’re my commander, so I\nwanted to let you know.”\n“What is it?” I asked.\nHe replied that he had been ordered to “check out rumors that Dan Shomron\nis a homosexual.”\nI was appalled. The whole thing stank, on every level, and not just because I\nwas confident the “rumors” were nonsense. “Look,” I said, “I have no idea\nwhether some sub-clause in army regulations allows the chief-of-staff to give\nyou orders over my head. But even if it does, I’m ordering you to do nothing\nuntil I talk to Moshe.” He nodded in agreement. In fact, he seemed relieved. He\nalso let me know that the source of the rumors was a number of senior officers,\nincluding a couple of generals.\nI went straight downstairs and into the chief-of-staff’s office. Moshe was at\nhis desk, smoking a cigarette. One of the advantages he had in being nearly a\nfoot taller than most of us was that I found myself looking not into his eyes, but\nup at them. “Moshe,” I said, “Ben-Dor told me you’ve ordered him to investigate\na rumor that Dan Shomron is a homosexual.” He said nothing. So I went on.\n“I’ve told him not to do it. And I’ve come here to convince you that it’s\n219\nimproper.” This was more than 30 years ago, at a time when being gay, and\ncertainly being gay in the armed forces, was a much bigger deal than now. But I\nstill had no doubt at all that this amounted to a witch-hunt.\nMoshe still said nothing. “I have no idea whether Dan is or is not a\nhomosexual. After knowing him for years, I have no reason at all to believe that\nhe is. But let’s assume, for a moment, that he is,” I said. He’s not some junior\nlieutenant… This is a man who has risked his life for Israel. Repeatedly. Under\nfire.” Then, I got to the real issue. “I hesitate to mention this,” I said, realizing,\nand in a way hoping, that my tone would sound vaguely threatening. “But if you\norder this, the very fact of doing so might be interpreted as being a result of\nsome other motives on your part. I’m doing my best to convince you to think\nagain. But I want you to know that if I can’t, I’m going from here to Misha’s\noffice. I’ll try to convince him of the damage from what you’re contemplating to\nthe whole fabric of trust in the general staff and the army, to the image of the\narmy.” Still, he said nothing. He nodded occasionally. He puffed on his\ncigarette, put it out, lit another one. It was pretty clear he had no intention of\nrescinding his order.\nWithin 20 minutes, was in the Minister of Defense’s office. I spoke to him for\nabout 10 minutes. Misha listened. At the end, he said: “I understand what you’ve\ntold me.” I never discovered what exactly he said to Moshe Vechetzi. But the\ninvestigation never happened. I never spoke a word about any of it to Dan until\nyears later, after both of us had left the army.\nThe result, however, was that Dan became deputy chief-of-staff under\nMoshe, the latest step in what was beginning to look like a steady rise to the top.\nBut Misha did make a few concessions to Moshe’s preferred candidates, and that\nnow turned out to have major implications for me. It was a long-accepted\npractice that chiefs-of-staff had more than one deputy during their period in\ncharge. In the homestretch of Moshe’s tenure, he was able to bring in Amir Drori\nfor a spell as his number-two. And early in 1986, he also brought Amnon Lipkin\nback to the kirya. Amnon was given my job, as Director of Intelligence. But I got\nthe post which Amnon was leaving: head of the central command area. This\nmeant that, for the first time, I would be in charge of one of Israel’s three regional\nmilitary commands, and we were based on the edge of Jerusalem, with security\nresponsibility for the West Bank.\nThis was my first direct exposure to the combustible mix of restive\nPalestinians and the growing number of Jewish settlers. Our main brief was to\nprevent terror attacks, violence or unrest from the roughly 850,000 West Bank\n220\nPalestinians toward the 50,000 Israelis who were then living in the settlements.\nAt the time, by far most Palestinians were not involved in any violence. They\nwere mainly interested in getting on with their lives. Yet there were signs of\ntrouble. The PLO leaders’ relocation to Tunis had reduced their direct influence.\nBut the briefings I got from Shin Bet officers made it clear that some young\nWest Bankers had begun trying to organize attacks against police, soldiers and\nIsraeli civilians. The settlements were also growing in number, and their\nresidents were not above acts of violence against Palestinians. Further\ncomplicating the situation was the fact the settlers enjoyed the support of key\nLikud members in the cabinet: Shamir, who was about to take his turn as Prime\nMinister in October 1986; Misha, now a minister without portfolio; and most of\nall Arik Sharon. In an astonishing demonstration of resilience and\ndetermination, not only had Arik remained as a minister without portfolio when\nShamir succeeded Menachem Begin. In the coalition government, he had\nbecome Minister of Trade and Labor. Most importantly, when he’d been\nAgriculture Minister under Begin, he was the driving force in plans to expand\nJewish settlement on the West Bank, including “blocs” placed around the major\nPalestinian towns and cities for the first time since 1967.\nI had a responsibility to protect the settlers, and I did my best to fulfil it. Yet\nI believed it was essential they understood that they were subject to the\nauthority of the state of Israel and, like other Israeli citizens, had to operate\nwithin the law. This was no mere theoretical problem. A Jewish underground\nhad been established by members of Gush Emunim, the Orthodox Jewish\nmovement set up in the 1970s to advance what they saw as a divinely mandated\nmission to settle the West Bank. It had carried out car-bombings and other\nattacks in the early 1980s, leaving two Palestinian mayors crippled for life. The\nterror campaign had ended only when the Shin Bet caught the cell placing\nexplosives under Arab-owned buses in Jerusalem.\nHopeful of preventing misunderstandings, and ideally building a relationship\nof trust, I visited many of the settlements during the early weeks in my new post\nand spoke with their leaders, a few of whom remain friends to this day. But in\nthe spring of 1986, we faced our first major test on the ground. In a pre-\nPassover event organized by Gush Emunim, some 10,000 settlers streamed into\nHebron, a city sacred not only to Jews but Muslims as well as the burial place of\nHebrew patriarchs and matriarchs. Peace Now activists had planned a counterprotest,\nbut Rabin denied them permission. Still, anti-settlement members of the\nKnesset and other Israeli peace activists did get clearance to march from\nJerusalem to Hebron.\n221\nMy job was to ensure the security not just of the Gush Emunim march but of\nthe counter-demonstrators, and, of course, the local Palestinian population. As\nthe rival marches by the Israelis proceeded, I personally delivered warnings\nagainst any violence, both to the settlement leaders and to a pair of the most\nprominent counter-protesters, the peace activist Uri Avneri and Knesset member\nYossi Sarid. The event went off without major incident. But the next day,\nDavar, the venerable Labor newspaper I’d first read as a child in Mishmar\nHasharon, let rip against me. Under a photo of me with Avneri and Sarid – my\narm raised, ostensibly in some kind of threat but actually in the time-honored\nJewish practice of talking with my hands – the article accused me of siding with\nthe settlers. If blood was spilled in the weeks and months ahead, the newspaper\nsaid, “it will be on Barak’s hands.”\nOrdinarily, I would have ignored it. But never in my military career had I\nbeen similarly attacked on an issue of any importance. I was especially angry\nbecause not only was the insinuation unfounded. It was diametrically opposite to\nthe stance I was determined to take in this, my first regional command. Yes, I\nwas committed to providing security for the settlers. But especially in the wake\nof the crimes of the Jewish underground, I was determined to ensure they\nremained within the boundaries of the law.\nA few days later, I called Rabin’s aide and asked to see the Defense\nMinister, and was told to come see him after Saturday lunch at his home. When\nI arrived, Rabin got right down to business. “Ehud, you wanted to see me?” he\nsaid. “You’ve probably seen Davar,” I replied. “It was a pretty nasty piece. It\ndistorted things.” Yet as he began asking for details, it seemed he had no idea\nwhat I was talking about. “Ehud, I never read it,” he said. “If you hadn’t told\nme, I’d never have known there was an issue.” I assumed this was a white lie,\ntold to reassure me. But years later, when I was Minister of Defense, and then\nPrime Minister, I sometimes found myself on the other side of such meetings.\nAn officer or official would come see me because of something said about them\nin the media, or remarks they were quoted as having made. When I told them\nI’d been unaware of it, I could see the disbelief in their eyes. By then, however,\nI realized that under the multiple demands of a senior role in government, you\nreally could fail to notice events that others viewed as crucial to their\nreputations or careers. To reassure them I truly hadn’t noticed, I’d tell them the\nstory of my meeting with Rabin.\n* * *\n222\nThere was another, slightly less noble, reason I wanted to set the record\nstraight with Rabin. Though only gradually did I admit this even to myself, I\nrealized that my experience in a regional command had ticked the one missing\nbox in the CV of our top generals, meaning that I might indeed be a candidate to\nsucceed Moshe Vechetzi as chief of staff. At first, I resisted taking the prospect\ntoo seriously. The job of ramatkal not only carried responsibility for overall\ncommand of the armed forces. Since our country still faced multiple security\nthreats, the chief of staff was, along with Prime Minister and Defence Minister,\namong the most important, influential and visible positions in Israeli public life.\nYet as the April 1987 date for the changeover drew nearer, it was difficult not to\nthink about it. Not only was I apparently under consideration. To judge from\nmedia reports, and officers’ smalltalk, it appeared that Rabin had whittled down\nthe possibilities to two. One was Dan Shomron, and I was the other.\nStill, it was only when Rabin phoned me early in 1987 that I knew it was\ntrue – and that I would not be getting the top job. “Ehud,” he said, “I wanted\nyou to know I’ve decided on Dan to be the next ramatkal. I want you to be his\ndeputy.” I can’t say I was surprised he’d chosen Dan. It wasn’t just that he was\nmore experienced, or even that, since he was older, missing out on the top job\nthis time would probably mean missing out for good. Yitzhak had always\nvalued Dan’s directness and honesty, his courage and record of service. Above\nall, I’d long sensed that he felt a special debt to Dan: for Entebbe. At a time\nwhen so much could have gone wrong, it was Dan who had taken a firm,\nconfident, successful hold on the operation.\nStill, I was now 45. For me no less than for Dan, I knew that if I was passed\nover as chief of staff, there was no guarantee I’d be chosen the next time. “I\nrespect your decision,” I told Rabin. “And I have no doubt Dan will be a good –\na very good – chief-of-staff.” But I had to consider my own future. “Even\nthough I’m grateful for the offer of deputy,” I said. “I think it’s better for me to\nleave. To open up a new chapter, and do something else in life.”\nRabin said he couldn’t accept that. “Come see me,” he said. “Now.” When I\ngot to Jerusalem, I emphasized again that I had no doubt Dan would lead the\narmed forces well. But I said my decision to leave the military wasn’t a mere\nwhim. I had been thinking about my own future and my family’s. We had three\nyoung daughters. A few months earlier, we had moved home again, into a wide,\none-story rambler with a big yard out back. It was in a new town called Kochav\nYair, just inside Israel’s pre-1967 border with the West Bank, and it struck me\n223\nas a good time to settle down in a way that would be impossible if I stayed on in\nthe upper reaches of the military. Perhaps do something more academic, in a\nuniversity or a policy think-tank.\nFor the first time, politics had some appeal, too, though I didn’t say this to\nhim. At that point, I had no idea how, or even whether, I might get involved.\nBut since my appearance on Moked, others seemed to assume it might happen at\nsome stage. Out of nowhere, a leading political journalist, Hanan Kristal, had\nwritten a story in 1986 purporting to predict the successors to Israel’s political\nold guard: Peres and Rabin in Labor, Begin and Shamir in the Likud. It\nappeared in the newspaper Hadashot. The paper ran side-by-side photos of the\nostensible future leaders, doctored to look older, who Hanan predicted would go\nhead-to-head in the election of 1996, a decade away. One was Israel’s\nambassador to the UN and a protégé of Misha Arens: Bibi Netanyahu. The other\nwas me.\nRabin listened with patience to my obviously settled intention to leave, but\nremained firm that I should stay and become Dan’s deputy. In the end, I agreed\nI’d think things over and that we’d talk in a week’s time. In the meantime, I\nwent to see two veteran generals who had found themselves in a similar\nsituation, mentioned as possible chiefs of staff but never chosen: Arik and Ezer\nWeizman. I saw Arik on his farm in the Negev. He was obviously enjoying his\nextraordinary political rehabilitation since the Lebanon war. His expanding girth\nwas settled into a sofa in the living room. I filled him in on my conversation\nwith Rabin. “I’m considering leaving,” I said. “It just seems like a long time to\nwait, even if I do get the job after Dan. There’s a lot else I want to do in life.”\nArik was probably the general most experienced in being denied the chief-ofstaff’s\noffice. On at least two occasions, he might reasonably have been\nconsidered. But in a career littered with tense encounters with his superiors, it\nnever happened. “You should stay on,” he said. You’re not that old. It’ll\nprobably be good for you, and the army, to be deputy and then chief.” The only\nfurther advice he gave me was to do all I could formally to commit Yitzhak to\nmaking me Dan’s successor after his term ended.\nI visited Ezer at his home in the seaside town of Caesarea. We sat on the\nterrace, with Ezer’s gangly frame draped over one of the cane chairs. “Ehud, if\nyou stay, do you think you have a good chance of being the next ramatkal,” he\nasked. I said that while nothing could be certain, I thought there was a good\nchance. He replied without hesitation: “Then stay.” He’d come close to the top\njob, he told me. On the eve of the Six-Day War, when Rabin had collapsed\n224\nphysically from the weeks of tension, Yitzhak had asked him to take over. He’d\nsaid no. But he said he’d always believed he could and should have been chiefof-staff\n– and that if he hadn’t left to go into politics, he still might have got the\njob. Then, suddenly, he shouted: “Reuma!” When his wife appeared, he said:\n“Tell Barak the missing piece in my life, the one I’ve never stopped regretting.”\nShe smiled, and said: “It’s the fact you did not become ramatkal.”\nI saw Rabin a couple of days later. Though I’d pretty much decided to take\nthe deputy’s job, I was still bothered by the prospect of serving as deputy for the\nnext four years only to find someone else being named chief-of-staff. I knew\nthat no matter what assurances Yitzhak gave me, there was no way of being\nsure. He did say he viewed me as the natural next-in-line. But I still felt hesitant.\n“I want you to consider two things,” I said. The first was a formal decision that\nDan would have only a single deputy during his time as chief-of-staff. He said\nyes to that. Yet the second request was going to be even more difficult.\nHeartening though it was to hear I was Dan’s “natural successor”, I asked him\nto put it in writing. It was not that I doubted his word. But if the surprise result\nof the last election was any indication, there was no way of predicting which\nparty would be in power when Dan’s terms ended. I wanted him to keep a\nrecord of our understanding in his desk and pass it on if someone else was\nDefense Minister by that time. Without a moment’s hesitation, he took out a\npiece of paper and wrote down exactly what he’d told me about the succession.\nHe shook my hand as I left. “You’ve made the right decision,” he said.\nAnd I had, even though Dan and I – and Rabin too – would soon face by far\nthe most difficult challenge in Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians since our\ncapture of the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 war.\n225\nChapter Fourteen\nIt began with an accident. On Tuesday, December 8, 1987, an Israeli tank\ntransporter crashed into a minibus carrying Palestinians from the Jabalya\nrefugee camp near the main crossing from Gaza into Israel. Four passengers\nwere killed.\nBy the time of the funerals the next day, a rumor had spread, no less\nincendiary for being absurd, that the crash had been deliberate – retaliation for\nthe fatal stabbing of an Israeli man a few days earlier. Crowds of Palestinians\nleaving the burials began shouting “Death to Israel!” They hurled rocks and\nbottles at Israeli security patrols, and blocked streets with burning tires. By the\nnext day, the violence started spreading to the West Bank, and then to parts of\neast Jerusalem. The headline-writers moved from the word “disturbances” to\n“unrest” and finally to the Palesitnians’ own name for the most serious outbreak\nof violence since 1967: the “intifada”. The uprising.\nAt least for the first week or two, we assumed its ferocity and scale would\nsubside. Our immediate aim was to contain it, and limit the human cost on both\nsides. Yet when Dan and I began visiting units on the front line of this new\nconflict, we realized that if it kept escalating, we’d have to find new tools and\nstrategies to bring it under control. We were in charge of an army trained to\nequip and fight enemy soldiers. Now, we were asking teenage recruits to\noperate as riot police against stone-throwing mobs. Before long, it wasn’t just\nstones, or even bottles. In one incident in Gaza, a young soldier was surrounded\nby a crowd of Palestinians and stabbed. He opened fire, wounding two of the\nattackers. Yitzhik Mordechai, now the head of the southern command, told\nreporters that his troops were under “strict orders to open fire only if their lives\nare under threat.” That was true. But I couldn’t help wondering how long the\nother part of his statement would hold: that we remained “in control of the\nsituation.”\nWe did feel in control for the first few days. Defense Minister Rabin was\naway in Washington on an official visit. When his office asked us whether he\nshould fly back, we said there was no need. But on his return, we quickly agreed\nthat, as a first priority, we needed to find an alternative to live ammunition in\nquelling the attacks. Otherwise, we’d be left with two equally bad options:\neither simply stand aside, in order to avoid killing or injuring demonstrators; or\nintervene with the inevitable casualties. But one of our most important early\ndiscussions was about the broader aspects of the violence. The meeting, held\n226\noutside the kirya in a facility just north of Tel Aviv, was Rabin’s idea. In\naddition to Dan and me, it included key members of the general staff and senior\ndefense ministry officials. The idea was for us to hear a half-dozen academics\nand other specialists speak about the political aspects of the sudden eruption of\nPalestinian violence.\nThough he spoke for barely 10 minutes, it was the last speaker who left the\ndeepest impression. Shimon Shamir, a professor at Tel Aviv University, began\nby emphasizing he was not an expert in riot control. Finding a response to the\nviolence was something we were far better equipped to do. But then he paused,\nlooked intently at Rabin, Dan and me, and said: “What I can do is draw on\nhistory.” One by one, he cited examples of more than a dozen broadly similar\nrebellions over the past century, in the Middle East and beyond. “If we were\ndealing with simple rioting, things might be different.” But he said the\nPalestinians were, fundamentally, acting out of a shared sense of grievance, and\nshared national identity. Both were in large part the result of Israel having\ncontrolled their daily lives now for more than two decades. “I’m afraid I can\nfind no historical precedent for the successful suppression of the national will of\na people,” he said. Even when those in power used unimaginably punitive tools:\nlike expulsion, or forced starvation. “Even, as we know well as a Jewish people,\nextermination.”\nI glanced at Yitzhak and at Dan. Both of them looked like I felt: in no doubt\nthe professor was right, yet also aware that, in the short term, we still had to find\na way of putting a lid on the cauldron and keeping the situation for getting\nirretrievably out of control.\nIt wasn’t as if I’d been unaware of the sense of the anger building among\nmany West Bank and Gaza Palestinians, or of their wish to see an end to Israel’s\nmilitary administration and the growing number of Jewish settlements. From\nmy time as head of the central command, I also knew that there was a young,\nactivist core intensifying efforts to organize attacks on troops and settlers. But\nnone of us had any inkling that something of the scale, longevity and political\ncomplexity of the intfada lay ahead.\nPartly, this was a failure of specific intelligence warnings. But it went deeper\nthan that. Sobering though it was, I had to accept that – no less so than before\nthe Yom Kippur War in 1973 – I and many others had for too long been\ncomforting ourselves with a fundamental misconception about our military\noccupation and civilian settlement in the areas captured in 1967. The roots of\nthe myopia went back to the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War, to the\n227\ngenerally civil, and often friendly contacts, Israelis had with Palestinians at the\ntime. The local population had, after all, been under other occupation powers\nbefore 1967: Jordan in the West Bank, and Egypt in Gaza. Assuming our\nadministration was less onerous, most Israelis believed a way to coexist could\nbe found. And that sooner or later, there would be a land-for-peace agreement\nand we would withdraw from at least most of the territory. But as the years\npassed, with no sign of a willingness by the PLO to consider any kind of peace\ntalks, we made the cardinal error of assuming the occupation was sustainable.\nYes, there might be periods of violence, but nothing that a combination of\npolitical resolve, arrests, detention and, where necessary, military force could\nnot hold in check. For us, and certainly for me, the Palestinians became\nessentially a security issue. As one of Israel’s finest novelists, David Grossman,\nwould lay bare in a bestselling book of reportage called The Yellow Wind, about\na year into the intifada, we had ceased to see the human effects of 20 years of\noccupation, not only on the Palestinians but on Israeli society as well.\nYet the power of Professor Shamir’s presentation lay not so much in its\nnovelty as its succinctness, clarity and, above all, its timing. The rioting had\nalready gone on for longer than any of us had expected. It seemed to be\ngathering strength. But until our meeting, we were still looking at it essentially\nas a civil disturbance. That was what began to change, for all of us.\nWhat didn’t change was the need to try to bring the violence to an end. Dan\nimmediately put me in charge of looking for alternatives to live ammunition. I\nbegan with our own research and development engineers. We also asked military\nattachés in our embassies to talk to law-enforcement agencies, academics, or\nanyone else with knowledge of non-lethal methods of crowd control overseas.\nSome of the more far-flung examples seemed promising, at least until further\ninvestigation. South Korea had years of experience in confronting student\nprotests – generally, though not always, managing to avoid fatalities. But it\nturned out this typically involved sending in serried rows of up to 25,000 riot\npolice against a few thousand campus protesters. Besides the fact we’d have\nneeded an army the size of the Americans’ to field enough soldiers, it was absurd\nto imagine dealing with dozens of far-flung confrontations on any given day with\nparade-ground formations of troops.\nWe looked at anything that seemed it might work. In the early stages, most\nof the attacks involved rocks and bottles. Our R&D engineers developed a Jeepmounted\n“gravel gun” that fired stones at a distance of up to 250 feet. They\ncould cause injuries, but weren’t lethal. We acquired launchers for pepper spray\n228\nand tear gas. We even looked at the possibility of dropping nets over crowds of\nattackers. Very early on, we shifted to using plastic bullets. But even that\npresented problems. At a distance of a hundred feet or so, they could drastically\nreduce deaths. But when a young recruit saw hundreds of Palestinians closing in\non him, he wasn’t about to take out a tape measure. Over time, we began relying\nwherever possible on rubber bullets and, in extreme cases, snipers to target the\nlegs of the organizers or ring-leaders.\nIf all of this sounds soul-destroying, that’s because it was. Especially with\ndaily television coverage of the clashes amplifying overseas support for the\nPalestinians, morale among our soldiers also took a battering. In visits to units\non the West Bank and in Gaza, Dan and I, and Rabin too, heard two opposite\nresponses. Some of the young soldiers wanted us to use maximum force. We are\nthe army, they argued. We have the weapons. Why the hell don’t we use them?\nBut we also heard another view, if less often: why are we here at all?\nWe imposed closures and curfews. We made thousands of arrests. Still,\nhundreds of soldiers and settlers were being injured, a number of them\ndisfigured or disabled. By the end of 1998, the Palestinian death toll was above\n300. In February 1989, an Israeli officer was killed by a cement block tossed\nfrom a rooftop in Nablus. A month later, a Palestinian knifed several people in\nTel Aviv, killing one of them. And in July, in the first attempt inside Israel at a\nsuicide attack, a Palestinian passenger grabbed the wheel of a bus on its way\nfrom Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and drove it off the road, killing 16 people.\n* * *\nBy the summer of 1990, although the violence had begun to flag slightly, I\nwas feeling more drained and exhausted than at any time since my bout of\nillness in the Sinai after the 1973 war. I even briefly thought of leaving the army\nafter Dan’s term ended the following year. I’m not sure whether I would have\ndone that if the situation had not begun to change. But it did, dramatically. The\nintifada gradually began to subside, and an entirely new crisis suddenly\nintervened.\nOn August 2, against a background of longstanding financial and territorial\ndisputes, Iraq’s Sadam Hussein sent in tens of thousands of his troops and\noccupied the neighboring state of Kuwait. Though the immediate crisis was\n229\nnearly a thousand miles away from us, he tried to divert attention from US-led\ninternational condemnation of his invasion by threatening Israel. He said “all\nissues of occupation” were on the table – the West Bank and Gaza, the Golan\nHeights, and Lebanon – and vowed to “let our fire eat half of Israel” in a future\nwar. And we could not assume this was mere rhetoric. Iraq had an arsenal of\nSoviet-made ballistic missiles. Called Scuds, they were not always accurate at\nlong range. But they could reach Israeli towns and cities, and could carry not\njust conventional explosives but chemical warheads. Moreover, Saddam had\nused chemical weapons: during the Iran-Iraq war, and to kill thousands of his\nown restive Kurdish population in the town of Halabja in the spring of 1988.\nEven the prospect of American military action seemed not to faze him.\nHours into the invasion, he moved an armored force toward Kuwait’s border\nwith Saudi Arabia, a key US regional ally, immediately prompting the President\nGeorge Bush’s administration to go beyond mere verbal condemnation. With\nSaudi agreement, Washington dispatched a squadron of F-15s to the kingdom –\nthe first step in what would become a huge American land, sea and air force to\nface down Saddam and force him out of Kuwait.\nGiven the credible threat of Scud missile attacks on Israel, Dan immediately\nassigned me to coordinate our assessment and evaluation of what Saddam was\nlikely to do in the event of a US-led attack, and what defense arrangements or\nIsraeli military response would be necessary. We knew we’d be under strong\npressure from the Americans to stay out of any war. Israeli involvement would\nbe a political gift to Saddam, allowing him to convert a conflict over his\naggression against an Arab neighbor into a “defense” against “Israeli\noccupation.” But we had a primary responsibility to protect our citizens.\nI was now working with a new Israeli government. After Shimon Peres tried\nand failed to topple the unity coalition in the spring of 1990, Shamir had formed\na Likud-led government shorn of both Peres and Rabin. Misha Arens was again\nMinister of Defense. I began preparing regular, fortnightly reports for him, Dan\nand Prime Minister Shamir. Within days of the invasion, I produced my initial\nassessment. The bottom line was that we had to assume there would be a war. It\nwas impossible to imagine the Americans would commit hundreds of thousands\nof troops and simply bring them home again, unless Saddam succumbed and\nretreated. I was equally certain Saddam would use his Scuds against us. He’d\nfigure the benefits of trying to bring Israel into the conflict far outweighed the\nrisk of retaliation. But I was “nearly 100 per-cent sure” he wouldn’t use\nchemical warheads, since that would almost guarantee an Israeli military\n230\nresponse, or an American one, on an incomparably greater scale. It would also\ntotally isolate Saddam internationally and end any chance of peeling off Arab\nsupport for the Americans.\nIt was my nearly 100-per-cent caveat that prompted a tense debate within the\ncabinet. Even if the probability of a chemical attack was microscopic, any risk\nof civilians being subjected to terror, panic and very possibly agonizing death\nmeant that the government had to take precautions. The obvious first step would\nbe to distribute gas masks. But in a series of meetings with Misha and Dan, I\nemphasized this was not a decision that could be taken in isolation. By handing\nout gas masks, we might actually raise the probability of a chemical attack. We\nalso had to make sure as a matter of urgency that we had a workable military\noption to attack Iraq’s Scud launchers.\nBy early November, I was dealing both with plans for distributing the gas\nmasks and preparations for a possible military operation. So when I got a call\nasking me to report to Shamir’s office in Jerusalem, I assumed he wanted to talk\nabout Iraq. “How are things?” he asked. But when I began by filling him in on\nthe plans to distribute the gas-masks, he interrupted me. “I called you here,” he\nsaid, “because I wanted you to know that we’ve decided that when Dan leaves\nnext April, we want you to replace him as chief-of-staff.” Briefly and unusually\ntongue-tied, I said: “Thank you, Prime Minister”. The news was made public\nthe next morning. A few days later, it was ratified by the government. There\nwas only one vote against, from a former chief of staff who was now Shamir’s\nAgriculture Minister: Raful Eitan.\nI was one of rare instances in all my years in the army when I took a step\nback, appreciating a moment which felt special. It was not only, or even mainly,\na matter of a personal ambition fulfilled. More a sense that I was being given\nthe opportunity to apply everything I’d experienced and learned in the army,\nfrom the day I first joined Sayeret Matkal as an 18-year-old, to improve the\nsecurity and safeguard the future of Israel. I know that sounds corny. But, while\nthe momentum toward war in Iraq almost immediately crowded out everything\nelse again, that was truly how I felt.\n* * *\n231\nBy mid-December 1990, war was virtually certain. Misha and I had been to\nWashington in September and agreed with the Americans that, unless we were\nattacked by Saddam, we would stay out of it. To do otherwise was clearly not\njust against the US-led coalition’s interests. Given the importance of our\nalliance with Washington, it was against our inrerests as well. Yet with\nhostilities obviously getting closer, Misha phoned Defense Secretary Dick\nCheney a few days later to remind him of the quid pro quo: we would be kept\nfully in the loop about the details and timing of the initial American air strikes.\nAt around five o’clock on the afternoon on January 16, 1991, Misha got a call\nfrom Cheney. He said “h-hour” would be at seven that evening Washington\ntime. Three a.m. in Israel.\nThough we hoped to stay out, I’d now spent months coordinating and\noverseeing preparations to ensure we could attack Saddam’s Scuds if necessary.\nBy far most of the missiles were mounted on mobile launching vehicles, and\nSaddam was almost certainly going to be firing them from the vastness of Iraq’s\nwestern desert. That meant an Israeli air strike alone wouldn’t work. We\ndecided on a joint air and ground operation, built around a newly created airmobile\ndivision and other special units. A force of 500 to 600 soldiers would\ntake control of key areas and road junctions in western Iraq and start hunting\nand destroying, or at least impeding, the Scud launchers.\nWe also engaged in secret diplomacy in the hopes of reducing one of the\nobvious risks in such an attack: a conflict with Jordan, which we’d have to\noverfly to reach Iraq. The Mossad had a unit called Tevel, a kind of shadow\nforeign ministry for states with which we had no formal relations but with\nwhich, in both side’s interests, we had a channel of backdoor communications.\nIt was headed by Ephraim Halevy, a London-born Israeli who had come to\nPalestine in 1948 as a teenager. He had built up a personal relationship with\nKing Hussein, and now arranged for us to meet him at a country residence\nwhich the king had in Britain.\nA few weeks before the war, I boarded a private jet to London along with\nHalevy and Prime Minister Shamir. Shamir had never met the king before and\nnor, of course, had I. But we didn’t talk about the forthcoming meeting on the\nfive-hour flight. Instead, Shamir opened up in a way I’d never seen: about his\nchildhood as part of a relatively well-off family in Poland; his love of literature,\nand of the Bible. In a way, it reminded me of how my father had spoken to me\nwhen I was growing up – minus the “well-off family” part.\n232\nWhen we got to Hussein’s country home, we were greeted by an\nimpressively self-assured man in his late 20s who, like Hussein, had studied at\nBritain’s military academy in Sandhurst and then gone on to Oxford. It was\nAbdullah, the king’s son and later his successor, and he explained that he would\nbe in charge of handling security for the talks. For a few hours in the afternoon,\nwe held preliminary discussions, and I presented our assessment of the\nchallenges and options facing all the different players in the crisis. Then we\nretired to a dinner at which – despite the royal china, crystal and silverware –\nthe atmosphere was also surprisingly informal.\nThe main meeting came the next morning. Both sides recognized the\nseriousness of the issues we had to discuss. Shamir began with the one we\nassumed would be the least difficult. Israel was on a heightened state of military\nalert, prompted by Iraqi reconnaissance flights over Jordan, and the likelihood\nthe Iraqis were also hoping to get a look at our main nuclear research and\ndevelopment facility in the nearby Negev. It was important to ensure this didn’t\nlead to an unintended conflict between us and the Jordanians. While the king\nwas careful to steer clear of any detailed comment on the Iraqi moves, he made\nit clear that he understood our concern about stumbling into an Israeli-Jordanian\nconflict and agreed that we had to avoid doing so.\nYet the issue of our overflights, if we needed to attack the Scuds, was more\nsensitive. We said that if we did have to cross into Jordanian air space, we\nwould find whatever way the king suggested to make it as unobtrusive as\npossible. We raised the possibility of using a narrow air corridor. His response\nwas not hostile, but it was firm. This was an issue of Jordanian sovereignty, he\ntold us. He could not, and would not, collaborate in any way with an Israeli\nattack on another Arab state. It was Ephraim who tried to find a way around the\napparent stalemate. He suggested Shamir and the king withdraw to speak alone,\nad they met for nearly an hour. When Shamir emerged, clasping the king’s hand\nand thanking him for his hospitality, he turned to us and said: “OK. We’re going\nhome.”\nHe didn’t tell us exactly what Hussein said. In the few sentences with which\nhe described the talks on the flight back, he said that, as a sovereign, Hussein\ncould not order his forces to ignore Israeli planes. But he added: “I assume there\nwill be no war with Jordan.” I took that to mean there might well be an attempt\nto intercept our jets, with the risk that either we or they might end up with one\nof our planes shot down, but that the king would use his authority and\nexperience to ensure this didn’t lead to a wider confrontation.\n233\n* * *\nThe Israeli public’s concern over a possible Iraqi attack was growing by the\nday, in part because of the precautionary measures we’d taken. We had handed\nout gas masks to the whole country. Though I’d been concerned that might raise\nthe prospect of a chemical attack, I still thought a chemical strike was highly\nunlikely. The government rightly decided that not distributing the masks would\nbetray a fundamental responsibility to the safety of our citizens. We’d also\nissued instructions about how to equip a room, usually the shelter included in\nnearly every Israeli home, as a cheder atum, or “sealed room” to keep gas from\ngetting in. The Israeli media was full of speculation about the likely effects of a\nchemical attack. Many families had begun panic buying of food and other\nnecessities to prepare for the possibility of days and nights in their sealed\nshelters.\nIn my report for Dan, Misha and Shamir a few weeks before the war, I drew\non systematic analysis by a team of experts in the Israeli air force and made my\nmost specific estimate yet of the damage conventionally armed Scuds might\ncause. We had gone back into historical accounts of the closest equivalent: the\nNazis’ use of V-1 and V-2 rockets against London in the Second World War.\nGiven Saddam’s primary need to fight Americans, and the likelihood either they\nor we would take military action against the launchers, we concluded we’d be\nhit by roughly 40 missiles, and that, based on Britain’s wartime experience, up\nto 120 Israelis might lose their lives as a result.\nThe first air-raid sirens wailed in Israel at about 2 a.m. on January 18, 1991,\nalmost exactly 24 hours after the Americans began their bombing raids over\nBaghdad. I was home in Kochav Yair. Like other Israelis, we’d set up a sealed\nshelter. Though I felt a bit silly doing it, having assured the government Saddam\nwas vanishingly unlikely to use chemical warheads, we woke up the kids and\nNava took them inside. I put on my own gas mask. But when I ran out to my\ncar, I removed my mask and put it on the passenger’s seat before heading in to\nthe kirya. I wanted to get there quickly enough so that the bor, the underground\ncommand bunker, wouldn’t have to reopened when I arrived. I took a short-cut,\nthrough the West Bank town of Qalqilya. That was, to put it mildly, stupid.\nAlthough the intifada had become steadily less intense during the build-up to\nthe war, it wasn’t completely over. Within seconds, my black sedan was being\n234\npelted with stones by a half-dozen Palestinian youths. I thought to myself: this\nis nuts. One of Saddam’s Scuds might well be about to hit Israel, and I’ve got\nmyself stuck in the middle of a West Bank town. To the obvious shock of the\nPalestinians, I floored the accelerator and raced toward Tel Aviv. It still took\nhalf-an-hour. Misha and Dan, who lived closer to the kirya, were already in the\nbunker.\nTen Scuds hit near Tel Aviv and Haifa that night. It was not until shortly\nbefore dawn that our tracker units got back to us with formal confirmation that\nthere had been no chemical warheads. The rockets caused a half-dozen injuries,\nthough thankfully none was serious. Still, the very fact Saddam had proven he\ncould hit Israel with ballistic missiles provoked widespread alarm. Well into the\nnext morning, the streets were almost empty. Misha phoned Cheney and\nstrongly implied we were going to have to attack the Scud sites. I know that was\nMisha’s own view, and it only hardened after another four missiles hit the Tel\nAviv area the next morning. Again, no one was killed, but several dozen people\nwere injured from debris, shards of glass and blast concussion. I visited several\nof the areas that had been hit and was shocked by the scale of the damage. One\nfour-story apartment building had been virtually destroyed, and there was blast\ndamage to other buildings hundreds of yards away.\nThe Americans were clearly determined, in both word and deed, to persuade\nus not to take military action. They rushed an anti-missile system called Patriot\nto Israel. Cheney was also giving us frequent updates on American air strikes\nagainst suspected Scud launch sites. And the Israeli public did seem to grasp the\nserious implications for the US-led coalition of our taking unilateral military\naction. Opinion polls suggested most Israelis were giving Shamir credit for the\nway he was handling the crisis.\nStill, it wasn’t easy for Shamir to hold the line. This was the first time since\n1948 that enemy munitions had landed on Israeli homes, provoking not just\nfear, but a feeling of helplessness. That inevitably led to calls for the army and\nthe government to do something. I saw his dilemma first-hand at an emergency\ncabinet meeting after the first two Scud attacks. For Arik and Raful, the political\neffects on the US coalition were irrelevant. The issue, for them, was simple:\nIsraeli cities had been attacked, and we should respond with any and all force\nnecessary. Our air force commander, Avihu Ben-Nun, favored going ahead with\nthe joint and-and-ground attack we’d prepared, and Misha agreed with him. So\ndid Dan Shomron. The key voices of caution were Foreign Minister David\nLevy; Ariye Deri, the leader of the Sephardi Orthodox party Shas; and two\n235\nyoung Likud politicians, Dan Meridor and Ehud Olmert, with whom I had\nbecome friendly. They, like me, were concerned about undermining the\nAmericans’ military and diplomatic coalition.\nShamir mostly listened, until very near the end. He then asked Dan Meridor,\nMisha and me to join him in a separate room. He asked each of us for our\nviews. Misha, even more strongly then in front of the full cabinet, argued that\nwe could not allow night after night of missile attacks without responding.\nMeridor reiterated his opposition, stressing the damage we’d risk doing to the\nAmericans’ war effort by possibly weakening Arab support for their attack on\nSaddam. When Shamir turned to me, I said that if the government did decide on\nmilitary action, we were ready. From a purely military and security point-ofview,\nI said, an attack made absolute sense. Even if we didn’t succeed in\ndestroying, or even finding, the mobile launch sites, putting a military force on\nthe ground would almost surely lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of\nScud launches. But, echoing Meridor, I added that a military response would\ncarry a price in our relationship with the Americans. My view was that, at least\nfor now, we should hold off.\nWhen we rejoined the meeting, Shamir rapped his hand on the table. In the\nstartled silence that followed, he said he shared many ministers’ urge to hit back\nagainst the Scuds. But he said: “At this stage, we’re not going to do anything.\nWe bite our lips and wait.”\nThree nights later, his resolve was stretched almost to breaking point.\nMissiles landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, and nearly 40 homes\nwere damaged. A three-story house was flattened. In all, nearly 100 people were\ninjured, and three elderly residents died of heart attacks. On the night of January\n25, another seven Scuds hit. Nearly 150 apartments were badly damaged, and a\n51-year-old man was killed. The pressure on Shamir was all the greater because\nthe Ramat Gan attack had come within range of one of the Americans’ Patriot\nbatteries. The Patriots had been originally designed not as anti-missile weapons,\nbut to attack aircraft, and they seemed to have been ineffective. Nor were\nAmerican air strikes in Iraq stopping the Scuds. Though American jets had\ntaken out a few fixed launch sites, they were having no luck with finding and\ndestroying mobile launch vehicles.\nEven Shamir now felt that unless the Americans got the mobile launchers,\nwe would have to attack military action. I was sent to Washington along with\nMisha and David Ivri, a former air force commander, to deliver that message to\nthe Bush administration. From the first days after Saddam’s attack on Kuwait,\n236\nI’d been impressed by President Bush’s political acumen in assembling an\ninternational coalition including the key Arab states. Through Unit 8200 in\nmilitary intelligence, we would only very occasionally get verbatim transcripts\nof his conversations as he brought first the Saudis and other Gulf states on\nboard, then Morocco, and eventually even Syria. More often, I’d see the\nPresident’s deft diplomacy second-hand, through intercepts of Arab leaders’\ncommunications with one another. But the picture which emerged was of an\nAmerican president deftly able to stake out common ground, and common\ninterests, with each of the Americans’ growing number of anti-Saddam allies.\nWhen we entered the Oval Office on the evening of February 11, Bush was\nflanked by Secretary of State Baker, Defense Secretary Cheney and national\nsecurity adviser Brent Scowcroft. Also there was Colin Powell, a general whom\nI had got to know well, and to like, over the past few years and who was now\nhead of the joint chiefs-of-staff. Given the seriousness of our mission, the start\nof the meeting was almost surreal. The Americans had obviously been told that\nI was born on February 12. Since it was just past midnight in Israel, they began\nby wishing me a happy 49 th birthday.\nYet pleasing thought that was, it became clear there was a disconnect\nbetween the tension among Israeli government ministers, and ordinary Israelis,\nback home and the relaxed, self-assured, at times even jovial mood of the\nPresident and his inner circle. Their primary focus was clearly not on Israel, but\non the overwhelming success of their air attacks on Iraq and the approach of a\nground offensive that they were confident would finish the job. That didn’t\nseem to change even after a truly extraordinary interruption to our meeting,\nwhen one of Misha’s aides passed on the news that a Scud had struck the Tel\nAviv suburb of Savyon, where Misha himself lived. He immediately excused\nhimself and went to phone his wife, Muriel, to confirm she was fine. When he\nreturned, despite their pro forma words of empathy, it seemed almost as if the\nAmericans thought we had cooked up the entire thing for political effect.\nBush did say the right things as the discussion turned to the missile attacks\non Israel. He told us he understood our frustration, and the pain the Scud\nlaunches were inflicting. He appreciated our restraint. I have no doubt that all of\nthat was true. But the message we’d been sent to deliver clearly wasn’t hitting\nhome. As politely but as clearly as I could, I told President Bush that while we\ndidn’t want to do anything to undermine the coalition, unless someone else took\ncare of the Scuds, we would have no choice but to act.\n237\nThe President responded by suggesting we go to the Pentagon and talk in\ngreater detail about how, for both our countries’ benefit, that could be avoided.\nWhen we convened in Secretary Cheney’s office, I delivered the same message,\nbut more forcefully. I felt it was essential not only to make it clear we serious\nabout taking action, but that we had the military capability to do so. So I told\nSecretary Cheney and Colin what we were planning. I said we intended to\nlaunch a combined air and ground assault by an air-mobile force and our best\nparatroop units. At that point, Colin, who was clearly worried, suggested the\ntwo of us withdraw to speak “soldier to soldier.” We retreated to his office.\nSpreading out a map of western Iraq, I went into greater detail, explaining how\nwe would remain in the Iraqi desert on a search-and-destroy mission against the\nmobile launchers. Colin stressed the efforts the Americans were making from\nthe air, and the commitment they’d shown to Israel. Not only had they delivered\nthe Patriots. They had allocated their best fighter jets, F-15E’s, to the task of\ntaking out the Scuds. It helped that he and I had got to know and respect each\nother, so it wasn’t an all-out argument. But I reiterated that if the Scud attacks\nkept up, we would have to act. “We will act,” I said. For a few seconds, he said\nnothing. But as we headed back to join the others, he told me that only a few\nhours ago, he had briefed American commanders on an anti-Scud operation by\n“allied forces” like the one we were planning. “It will happen,” he assured me.\n“Within 48 hours.”\nThat task fell to Britain’s SAS. The operation was almost exactly the same as\nthe one we’d planned. A force of nearly 700 commandos was helicoptered in to\nIraq’s western desert, equipped with Jeeps and Land Rovers, and anti-tank\nmissiles and laser targeting capability. They were also able to call on attack\nhelicopters and F-15 jets if necessary. The operation did not prove easy, quick,\nor entirely successful. The British troops blocked the main roads and patrolled\nthem. But they did not find or destroy a single mobile launcher. They ended up\nin gun battles with Iraqi troops. The SAS lost something like two dozen men.\nFive were part of a group that got separated from the others and ended up\nfreezing to death in the February cold. All of the men risked their lives, with\nincredible determination and bravery, in an operation to secure the safety of\nIsrael’s civilian population. And I have no doubt that the outcome, like the plan,\nwould have been almost identical if we had done it ourselves.\nAnd it did have an effect. As I’d told Prime Minister Shamir when briefing\nhim on our attack plan, the very fact of a military presence on the ground made\na dramatic difference. The number, accuracy and impact of the Scuds dropped\noff steeply. A few missiles kept coming, however. Since we did not yet have a\n238\nfully detailed picture of the progress of the SAS action, skeptics and hawks in\nthe cabinet were inclined to see a glass half-empty. They continued to press for\nIsraeli military action.\nIn a rare public statement, I tried to reassure the country we did have a\nmilitary option, but also to urge restraint. I pointed out that the number of Scuds\nhad begun decreasing. Though the threat had not been eliminated altogether, we\nhad “very good operational plans” that would be “carried out when and if the\nIsraeli government instructs us to implement them.” Yet I added a caveat. “On\nthe political level, fingers are itching to carry out operations which, in our\nopinion, can remove the threat. But in the complex situation created by this war,\nneither anger, hurt, nor itchy fingers can replace rational thinking.”\nThe American ground invasion did turn out to be swift and decisive. In\nIsrael, Scud attacks continued for a few more days. But the last two missiles fell\nin the Negev before dawn on February 25, among the very few to cause neither\ncasualties nor damage. We turned out to have been right in our pre-war\nassessment about the number of missiles: around 40. Fortunately, the casualties\nwere far fewer than we’d anticipated. Not 120 dead, but fifteen, only one of\nwhom died directly because of a missile blast. The other deaths were the result\nof understandable panic: the misuse of gas masks or the gas antidote drug\natropine, or from respiratory and cardiac failure. The physical damage,\nhowever, was far greater than I’d anticipated. Buildings were destroyed. Cars\nwere crushed. Glass and debris flew everywhere. In financial terms, the cost ran\nto hundreds of millions of dollars. The true impact was greater: on families who\nsaw the destruction not only their homes, but a lifetime of prized possessions.\nFor Holocaust survivors in particular, there was the almost unimaginable terror\nof having to huddle in sealed rooms for fear of gas. And all Israelis had\nexperienced a new sense of vulnerability to a faraway enemy whom they\ncouldn’t see nor, apparently, stop.\n* * *\nI was due to become Israel’s 14 th chief-of-staff at the start of April, barely a\nmonth after the last Scud attack. As the handover drew nearer, I felt fortunate,\nin a way, to have missed out on the job four years earlier. Not only had Dan\nexcelled as ramatkal. I’d benefited from his range of experience, his judgment,\nand his trust as well. We had worked together truly as a team.\n239\nI was grateful not only to Shamir for naming me chief-of-staff, but to Rabin\nand Misha. Both had honored the assurance Yitzhak had given me that I’d be\nDan’s successor. I also discovered Misha had played an even greater role than\nI’d assumed. I knew there would be other candidates for the job. The strongest\nturned out to be Yossi Peled, who was the head of the northern command and\npossessed the undoubted credentials to be an excellent chief-of-staff. What I\nhadn’t been aware of was the sentiment among some in the Likud that I was the\nwrong choice politically. Not only had been born on a Labor kibbutz. There was\nthe small matter of the article in Hadashot several years earlier, imagining me\nas a Labor leader going head-to-head in a future election against Bibi\nNetanyahu for the Likud.\nYossi was assumed to be more of a Likudnik, and a few weeks before Dan\nleft office, I learned how Misha had rebutted the suggestion I was politically\nunfit to lead the armed forces. He was visiting the north and was taken aside by\na group of Likud activists who asked how he could possibly be thinking of\nsupporting Barak – a Labor guy – for chief-of-staff. At first, Misha didn’t reply.\nBut one woman kept pressing him.\n“Do you have children in the army?” he asked.\n“Yes. I have a son in the Golani Brigade,” she replied proudly.\n“So let’s assume your son is going on a raid across the border. Would you\nwant his company to be led by the best commander in the battalion? Or by a\ncommander who’s Likud?”\n“The best commander, of course,” she said.\nTo which Misha said: “Well we do, too.”\n240\nChapter Fifteen\nOn the morning of April 1, 1991. I got up even earlier than usual, to visit the\ngraves of the men who had lost their lives in my battalion in the Yom Kippur\nWar. I also went to pay my respects to Uzi Yairi, killed when he’d rushed from\nhis desk in the kirya to join the Sayeret Matkal attack at the Savoy Hotel. Then\nNava and I drove to Jerusalem. At Israel’s national military cemetery on Mount\nHerzl, we stood before the resting place of Nechemia Cohen, Yoni Netanyahu,\nDado, and Avraham Arnan. From there, we went to the Prime Minister’s office.\nWith Dan Shomron and his wife looking on, Shamir presented me with my third\nstar and formally made me chief of staff.\nFor years, I’d developed the habit of carrying around a notebook in which\nI’d jot down thoughts on things I thought that the Israeli military, and I as an\nofficer, could have done better: errors, oversights, and how we might fix them.\nIn the weeks before becoming ramatkal, I’d filled dozens of pages on issues\nlarge and small I hoped to address as the commander of the armed forces. A lot\nof them dealt with what I sensed was an erosion of cohesiveness in the army,\nand, since ours was a citizen military, a fraying of the relationship between the\narmy and Israeli society. To some degree, this was inevitable in a country now\nnearly 45 years old: developed economically and free of the kind of existential\nthreat we’d faced in the early years of the state. But the political divisions over\nthe war in Lebanon, and morale-sapping need to quell the violence on the West\nBank and in Gaza had further strained our unity of purpose.\nMilitarily, we were now indisputably strong enough to defeat any of the\nArab armies, even if they launched a joint attack as in 1973. Our most important\noverseas ally, the United States, was committed to helping us retain that\nposition – what both we and they called Israel’s “qualitative edge” – in the\ninterest of our security and their own. But we were facing a series of new,\nunconventional challenges. One of them, which had come on to Dan Shomron’s\nand my radar over the past year, was Iran. Though geographically distant, it was\npotentially the most serious in the longer run, as Dan himself warned Israelis in\nhis final interview as chief of staff. Iran was likely to become even more\nassertive regionally now that the Gulf War had weakened its neighbor and rival,\nIraq. We also knew, from our intelligence sources, that the Iranians were\nmaking preliminary efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.\n241\nYet the most immediate security concerns were right next door. In Lebanon,\nHizbollah fighters were being armed and financed by the Iranians and by Syria\nas well. They were mounting increasingly effective operations against the\nIsraeli troops we’d left in the security zone. Even closer to home, Palestinian\nattacks on both troops and civilians, though on nowhere near the scale of the\nfirst months of the intifada, showed no sign of ending. I had my own views on\nboth. In Lebanon, I still believed we should pull out all our troops and focus our\nsecurity arrangements on what really mattered: protecting the citizens of\nnorthern Israel. As for the lessons to be learned from the intifada, my view that\nwe needed a political dialogue had inadvertently become public, from remarks I\nmade in Moshe Dayan’s honor at a memorial event a few months before\nbecoming chief of staff. “We are currently in a struggle with the Palestinians – a\nlong, bitter and continuing struggle,” I said. “A people cannot choose its\nneighbors. But we will have to talk to the Palestinians about matters, especially\nabout issues that are vital to them.”\nStill, I was the commander of the armed forces, not a politician. Though all\nchiefs of staff had political influence, if only as part of the decision-making\nprocess on all major security questions, making policy was for our elected\ngovernment. My main focus was on how to improve the military’s fitness to\nrespond. I’d lived through, and more recently fought in, all of Israel’s wars. I\nfelt that we had yet to apply some of the critical lessons from those conflicts.\nLeading tanks into battle against the Egyptians’ deadly Sagger missiles in 1973,\nand a decade later watching whole Israeli armored columns stalled and attacked\nby small bands of PLO fighters or Syrian commandos in Lebanon, had hardened\nmy conviction that Israel needed a leaner, more mobile army, with more\nspecialised strike units, as well as more easily targeted, less vulnerable weapons\nsystems. I wanted to shift the emphasis to weaponry that relied on Israel’s\nstrengths in new technology, invention and engineering. In a sense, this was the\nmacroscopic equivalent of one of the guiding principles of Sayeret Matkal:\nbrains, not just brawn.\nWhile cost-saving wasn’t the catalyst, I did realize that a change in strategy\nwould mean a change in how we allocated our resources. When Israel bought its\nfirst Mirage jets from France in the 1960s, they cost about a million dollars\napiece. The price tag of an F-16 was now closer to fifty million dollars. The cost\nof a tank had increased tenfold. I wasn’t going to deprive the air force of stateof-the-art\naircraft, key to our ability to fight and win a war. But while we still\nneeded a strong armored corps, it was important to realize that units like the\n242\nnew air mobile division we’d planned to use against Saddam’s Scud launchers\nwere likely to be a lot more important than tank formations in future conflicts.\nSix days into the job, I called together every officer in the army, from the\nrank of lieutenant-colonel up. I said we needed to remind ourselves of the\narmy’s purpose: to protect Israel’s security and, if a war came, to win it. My\nbudgetary rule of thumb over the next four years would be simple: anything that\ndidn’t directly contribute to that mission was expendable. In fact, I put it a bit\nmore bluntly: “We need to cut anything that doesn’t shoot.”\nMy first attempt failed utterly. I proposed to close, or sell off, the army’s\nradio station, Galei Tzahal. Running it cost serious money. If we were going to\ncut everything that didn’t shoot, it was an obvious candidate. But what I failed\nto take into account was its popularity with the listening public. Although other\nradio stations had opened recently, for many years it had been the only major\nalternative to the state-funded Kol Yisrael. It also provided a training ground\nand employment feeder for future journalists. Galei Tzahal’s alumni included\nsome of the country’s top media figures, and more than a few members of the\nKnesset. Within weeks, a lobbying effort was underway to “save” the station. I\nwent to see Misha. He agreed that, from a military and budgetary standpoint,\nclosing it was the right thing to do. But in an early lesson in how different\npolitics were from the army, he told me that politically, it simply wasn’t going\nto fly. “Drop it, Ehud,” he said. So I did.\nStill, I did end up fundamentally retooling the armed forces during my time\nas chief of staff. We developed agile new strike forces and high-precision, hightech\nweapons systems with “stand-off” munitions designed to be fired from\nmany miles away. In the 1973 war, and for the decade or two that followed,\nSaggers, and the US-made TOW missiles that Israel acquired after the war, had\nthe capability to transform a battlefield. Now, Israeli developers came up with\nsmall, ground-launched missiles that could take out a tank from five to 10 miles\naway, even without a direct line of sight to the target. Of even more long-term\nmilitary significance, I pushed ahead with developing pilotless drones – socalled\nUAVs – making us the first army in the world to produce and deploy\nthem.\nYet for a security challenge like the intifada, even the most advanced standoff\nmunitions or UAVs offered no practical answer. The latest stage in the\nviolence involved knife attacks by Palestinians against Israeli civilians, both on\nWest Bank settlers and inside Israel. Days after I took over, a 26-year-old from\nGaza, wielding a butcher’s knife and shouting Alahu Akhbar, killed four people,\n243\nincluding a kindergarten teacher, in Jerusalem. On the morning of May 24,\n1992, a 15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl named Helena Rapp was on her way to\ncatch the bus to school south of Tel Aviv, when another Gazan stabbed her to\ndeath. To the extent Israelis were looking for someone to blame, there were\nobvious candidates. The army, the primary defense against the intifada, was\none. The police even more so, since many of the attacks were now taking place\ninside Israel. And in ugly rioting after Helena Rapp’s murder, bands of Israelis\ntook to the streets, some of them yelling: “Death to the Arabs”. Still, most\npeople understood that criticizing the army or the police, or going on a rampage\nagainst “the Arabs” – hundreds of thousands of whom were Israeli citizens and\nhad lived among us since the birth of the state – would not help. Most, in fact,\nplaced the blame, and lodged their hopes, with the government.\nBy the time of the next election, in June 1992, the combination of Palestinian\nviolence and the still-traumatic memories of Saddam’s Scuds, left Israelis\ndoubtful that Shamir could fulfil the most basic responsibility of government:\nensuring their day-to-day security. Labor had once again placed its electoral\nfortunes in the hands of Yitzhak Rabin, following Peres’s several failed\nattempts to lead the party back into power. Knowing that Rabin had a record of\nmilitary command unmatched in Israeli politics, Labor strategists did not so\nmuch need to convince voters as to reinforce their fears and frustrations. One of\nthe campaign slogans, a direct appeal to the anger over the stabbing of Helena\nRapp, was “Get Gaza out of Tel Aviv!” Labor ended up gaining five Knesset\nseats, and now had 44. The Likud lost eight and was left with only 32.\nThat meant that my last three years as chief of staff would be with Rabin\nback as Prime Minister – and, like Ben-Gurion before him, as Defense Minister\nas well. He and I had been in touch only occasionally since his departure from\nthe unity-coalition government two years earlier. But I had, of course, spoken\nwith him after my appointment as ramatkal, in which he’d played an important\npart. Though he was 20 years older than me, our relationship had become\nsteadily closer over the years, especially when I’d worked with him as Defense\nMinister. In some ways, we were alike. We’d both been forged by Labor\nZionism. We were career military officers, uncomfortable with flights of\npolitical rhetoric and convinced that Israel’s security and its future depended\nless on words than on action. In large groups especially, both of us tended to be\nmen of a few words. Over the next few years, we would become even closer,\nspeaking not only in the kirya or at Yitzhak’s office in Jerusalem, but also, with\nNava and Leah, around the dinner table at Rabin’s apartment in Tel Aviv.\n244\n* * *\nBut there were times of crisis, and high tension, as well. Only five months\nafter the election, Rabin and I faced one of the most painful periods during my\nentire time as chief of staff. It began with the gruesome death of five Sayeret\nMatkal soldiers during a training exercise in the Negev desert. I’d made\npreventing such accidents a top priority. By the end of the 1980s, they were\nclaiming as many as 80 lives a year. During Dan’s tenure, we’d brought the\nnumber down to about 35. But I knew we had to do more. When I’d addressed\nthe officers after becoming chief of staff, I told them: “Parents are giving us\ntheir children in order to allow us to protect the country. They know there is risk\ninvolved. But they expect their children not to be brought home in coffins\nbecause of our own negligence, or stupidity.” What happened at the military\nbase of Tze’elim in the Negev on November 5, 1992 was not only a reminder of\nhow far we still had to go, however. It occurred during a dry run for an\noperation unlike any that Israel had ever considered. For that and other reasons,\nit would erupt into a major political controversy.\nThough the reason for the exercise was meant to have remained a closely\nguarded secret, foreign newspaper reports in the weeks after the training\naccident made secrecy impossible. We were planning to infiltrate a Sayeret\nMatkal unit into Iraq, and to kill Saddam Hussein.\nThe Gulf War had blunted any immediate threat from Iraq. But Saddam had\nproven he could launch missiles into the heart of Israel. We knew from our\nintelligence reports that, in addition to his unabated desire to acquire nuclear\narms, he retained facilities to produce chemical weapons. He was trying to\nacquire and develop new biological weapons. In fact, the Iraqis had actually\nacknowledged a biological weapons program to UN inspectors, claiming it was\nfor “defensive purposes.”\nThe idea for an attack on Saddam had first been raised a year earlier, when\nmy former Sayeret Matkal comrade, Amiram Levin, asked to see me. He was\nbetween military postings, but had come up with the outline of a plan he felt\nwould allow us to isolate Saddam during a public appearance and kill him. With\nmy approval, he and a small group of officers in the sayeret began working\nfurther on the idea, with the initial aim of seeing whether it was really workable.\nSince Misha was still Defense Minister, I briefed him on what we were doing. I\n245\nalso briefed Rabin after the election. At that stage, there was no discussion of\nwhether we actually would, or should, target Saddam. I asked Misha, and then\nYitzhak, only whether such an operation might seriously be considered by the\ngovernment. If not, I said, we’d drop it. Both replied that we should go ahead\nwith the planning and preparation. The November 1992 exercise was intended\nas a final test of its viability – before deciding whether actually to do it.\nA few weeks earlier, Rabin and I had talked through the arguments for and\nagainst. The arguments against it were obvious. Yes, in the past we had\nabducted, or even killed, leaders of groups involved in terror attacks. But we’d\nnever contemplated targeting a head of state. Crossing that line risked being\nseen not just as attacking a dictator with a record of ruthlessness and murder at\nhome, and aggression towards Israel, but long-accepted norms of international\nrelations. The arguments in favour began with the fact that Saddam was a\nmeglomaniacally ambitious dictator. He had also fired missiles on our towns\nand cities. He retained the capability to arm them with chemical warheads,\npossibly biological agents, and conceivably a nuclear warhead in the future.\nBoth Rabin and I agreed there were two key tests of whether an attack would be\njustified: was it was the only realistic way of confronting the threat from Iraq,\nand would killing him end, or at least exponentially reduce, that threat.\nThough there was no final decision at our meeting, Rabin was clearly\ninclined to go ahead. An Israeli TV program two decades later unearthed a\nsummary of the discussion, written by his military aide. “The Prime Minister\napproves the target... This is an operation we should go for when the probability\nof success is very high,” it said. “Thus, we have to build the operational\ncapability in the best possible way, and continue preparations.” In another part\nof the record, Rabin is quoted as having defined the elimination of Saddam as a\n“meaningful objective” with implications for “the very security of Israel.” He\nadded: “I do not see anyone similar to him in the Arab world.”\nI, too, was on balance persuaded we should do it. In the years since, I’ve\nsometime reflected on what happened with Saddam still in place: the 2003\ninvasion of Iraq, led by the younger President Bush, the tens of thousands of\nlives lost, the trillions of dollars spent on a war without any clear end, and the\nnear-disintegration of Iraq. But with the complexities of Iraq then and now,\nthere can be no simple answer to how the situation would have changed if we’d\nkilled Saddam. Our view, based on detailed intelligence analyses, was that the\nlikely result would have been a fairly rapid takeover by a few top security and\nBaath Party figures and that, while the new Iraqi leadership might try to retaliate\n246\nwith terror attacks, a major military response was highly unlikely. Saddam’s\nsuccessors were never going to be Zionists. But we were persuaded that his\nuniquely central role meant the threat to Israel would be dramatically reduced.\nI’m much less sure whether the elder President Bush, whose election defeat\nto Bill Clinton came just two days before our final exercise in the Negev, would\nhave agreed with the attack. After the victory in the Gulf War, Bush had\ndeliberately stopped short of sending American forces on to Baghdad. He was\nalso vice-president, under Reagan, when Israel had bombed Saddam’s nuclear\nreactor – an attack publicly condemned by Washington. I did ask him some\nyears ago whether the Gulf War might have been handled differently if Israel\nhadn’t taken out Saddam’s nuclear program a decade earlier. “What if he’d had\na couple of crude nuclear devices,” I said. President Bush smiled in response.\nHe said he didn’t deal with “hypotheticals.”\nYet any idea of an Israeli attack on Saddam became instantly irrelevant once\nforeign media reports had disclosed the reason for our ill-fated military exercise\nin the Negev. Inside Israel, the focus, and the controversy, shifted to the\naccident itself.\nThe foreign media reports of the operation we were planning proved\nremarkably accurate. Some of the details still remain classified, but we were\ngoing to use one of our new “stand-off” weapons systems: a camera-guided\nmissile that could be fired from a considerable distance away and, in\ncoordination with one of the Sayeret Matkal soldiers nearer in, maneuvered in\nfor the strike. After months of planning and intelligence work, we were\nconfident that we’d found a way to get the sayeret unit into Iraq, target Saddam\nat an event we knew he would be attending, isolate and kill him with minimal\ndanger of any other casualties, and get our unit out safely again. The Negev\nexercise was a run-through of the entire operation. It lasted nearly 48 hours. And\nit culminated in a simulation of the missile attack on Saddam.\nI was there as an observer along with Amnon Lipkin, my deputy chief-ofstaff;\nas well as the head of military intelligence, the head of operations and\nAmiram Levin. We assembled at dawn for the simulation of the missile attack.\nWe watched from a few hundred yards away as a group of young Israeli soldiers\nwalked into a wide area in front of us: posing as Saddam” and his entourage.\nWe – and they – knew that this was just the first part of the exercise. In a Land\nRover more than five miles away, a member of the sayeret strike unit would be\nconfirming coordinates and, in rapid succession, “firing” two of the precision\nmissiles. But this was just to confirm that the targeting system had worked\n247\nperfectly. No missiles would actually be shot. This stage was for the telemetry.\nOnce that was done, the soldier-actors would be replaced with wooden targets\nand the real munitions would be tested.\nThe young soldiers stated chatting to one another, and milling about,\nsimulating as best we could the circumstances in which we expected to target\nSaddam if the operation got final approval. In theory, within a minute, two\nminutes at most, we would get word that the preliminary mock-firing sequence\nhad gone perfectly – at which point the artillery-range targets would be brought\nin for the live test. But suddenly, there was an explosion. A split second of\nsilence. Then pandemonium. There was no need to know, and no time to\nwonder, what exactly had gone wrong, or how it had been allowed to happen. It\nwas obvious to all of us that the live missiles had been fired. We sprinted\nforward. When we got to the group of soldiers, we could see that four of the\nyoung men were dead. Another was fighting for his life. Several others were\nalso wounded.\nA sayeret medic and several senior officers were trying to save the most\nbadly injured man, but I knew I needed to get military doctors and medical\nevacuation helicopters in immediately if we were to save the lives of the injured\nsoldiers. I had a mobile phone, but couldn’t get a signal. I ran toward a slightly\nhigher area a few dozen yards away and managed to get through to the kirya. I\nissued orders for the nearby training base in Tze’elim and an air force near\nBeersheva to dispatch helicopters to treat and evacuate the wounded.\nWe heard the first chopper about 25 minutes later, but it seemed initially\nunable to see us, because it flew on before returning and landing two minutes\nlater. By that time, a medical team from the base in Tze’elim had arrived. Ten\nminutes later, two other medevac choppers landed. But the soldier who had\nbeen worst wounded could not be saved. After the doctors had been there about\n20 minutes, I again retreated to the area where I could get a mobile signal, and\nphoned Rabin to tell him what had happened. We agreed I should come back to\nbrief him in detail. It was now about 50 minutes since the missiles had hit. The\nwounded were all being treated. One of the helicopters had taken off for\nBeersheva Hospital. Another two, including a heavier Sikorsky transport\nhelicopter, were preparing to leave. I arranged for Amnon, military intelligence\nchief Shmuel Arad and me to return to the kirya. I told Amiram to stay until he\nhad confirmed all the injured had been evacuated, and talk to everyone involved\nto get a preliminary idea of why and how the tragedy had happened.\n248\nWhen I got back, we immediately met with Rabin and agreed on the need to\nlaunch a formal investigation. Rabin then asked me to brief the “editors club”, a\ngroup of about 15 media figures that operated on a gentleman’s agreement that\nthere would be no publicity or leaks. He believed we should not make public the\nfact that I and other generals were there when the accident occurred. At this\nstage, we still hoped to hide the purpose of the exercise if possible, something\nRabin knew would be harder if it was known the top military leadership had\nobserved the exercise. When I briefed the editors’ club, I did tell them in\nconfidence that I’d been there. Though not specifying the reason for the\nexercise, I told them it was for a major operation. The time-honored\nunderstanding was that this information would go no further. But it did,\npresumably at first because of leaks by Israeli journalists, then in a series of\ndetailed reports in the foreign press. Even more frustrating on a personal level,\nsome of the Israeli reports insinuated that far from giving the editors the full\nstory of who had been at the Negev exercise, that I’d tried to hide my presence\nin order to protect my reputation or shirk responsibility.\nTwo official inquiries followed: the one we’d agreed with Rabin and a\nstandard army legal investigation. They found the cause of the tragedy to be a\nmix of fatigue after some of the soldiers had spent nearly 48 hours awake,\npressure, confusion and negligence. Astonishingly, it turned out the codeword\nfor the mock-firing of the missiles in the first stage of the exercise was the same\nas for the live missiles. Formal charges were brought against two Sayeret\nMatkal officers, and reprimands issued to Amiram Levin and Uri Saguy. I was\nalso subject to criticism because, due to the unique complexity of the plan, I’d\nput Amiram and senior officers within Sayeret Matkal in charge of different\naspects of the preparations. This was viewed as possibly reducing the clarity\nover who was ultimately responsible for each aspect of the planning. Neither I,\nnor of course Rabin, had played a direct role in what went wrong in the exercise\nitself. To the extent I’d been involved, it was to make sure the medical teams\nwere helicoptered in, and that the injured soldiers were cared for and evacuated\nas soon as possible. But politically, the tragedy at Tze’elim would dramatically\nresurface for both me and Rabin several years later – after I’d left the military\nand was on the verge of joining his government.\nI was getting to know Yitzhak much better. The Defense Minister’s office in\nthe kirya was just down the hall from mine. Almost without fail on Friday\nafternoons, he’d ask me in to chat before going home. We would sit around a\nlow table in the corner of the room, each of us sipping coffee, or sometimes\nbeer, and Rabin invariably puffing on a cigarette. He never raised questions of\n249\nparty politics. But we talked at length about Israel’s immediate security\nconcerns, as well as the country’s longer-term challenges in finding its place in\nmore stable, peaceful Middle East. How, over time, we might manage to\nextricate ourselves from the escalating violence with Hizbollah; reach a landfor-peace\ndeal with the enigmatic President Hafez al-Assad in Syria; and find\nsome form of coexistence with the Palestinians.\nHe also spoke about international politics. I remember one afternoon in the\nsummer of 1992 when he mentioned the then US presidential candidate Bill\nClinton. He’d met Clinton for the first time in Washington, after two days of\ntalks with President Bush at his summer home in Maine. Rabin was naturally\nmore comfortable dealing with Republicans. Almost all his experience in public\nlife – as a military officer, ambassador to Washington, Defense Minister and\nPrime Minister – had coincided with Republican administrations. The irony was\nthat he would go on to forge a much closer relationship with President Clinton\nthan between any previous Israeli and US leader. But his first impression was\nmore skeptical. “Clearly, Clinton is very intelligent,” he said. “He is\nsurprisingly sharp politically for someone his age. But also, I fear, a little bit too\nslick.”\n* * *\nWe did not have long to focus on the lessons and implications of Tze’elim.\nFor weeks before the training accident, a crisis had been building in south\nLebanon, with a sharp escalation of the now-familiar mix of clashes inside our\n“security zone” and cross-border rocket attacks. Hizbollah was now armed not\njust with Katyushas but Saggers, American-made TOW anti-tank missiles and\nan increasingly sophisticated array of roadside bombs. A combination of\nHizbollah attacks and “friendly fire” incidents or firearms accidents involving\nour troops meant that Israelis were still dying in Lebanon a decade after the\nformal end of the war. It was demoralizing for the Israeli public, for the soldiers\nwho we rotated into the security zone and for the government as well. The\ndifficulty was that it was also a situation that perfectly suited Hizbollah.\nIn late October, a Katyusha rocket had claimed the life of a 14-year-old boy\nin the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. Hizbollah escalated its rocket\nfire in the days that followed, forcing tens of thousands of residents into their\nshelters. Predictably, there was pressure from Likud politicians to hit back hard.\n250\nRaful Eitan, who had founded a small right-wing party called Tsomet, went\nfurther. He called the attacks “an act of war” and said we should “respond in\nkind.” We did move troops and tanks to the border. But my view, which Rabin\nshared, was that a major ground operation would risk miring ourselves more\ndeeply without fundamentally improving the situation. Hizbollah was the kind\nof nonconventional enemy I had in mind when I’d taken stock of Israel’s\nchanging security imperatives on becoming chief of staff. It was a small force,\nentrenched and well armed, increasingly supported by Iran and Syria. Its tactics\nrested on quick-hit attacks on our soldiers in south Lebanon. Far from fearing\nmilitary retaliation, Hizbollah knew that short of a 1982-scale war – and maybe\neven then – it would survive. It also didn’t care whether Lebanese civilians died\nin the crossfire. In fact, like the PLO fighters who had controlled the area before\n1982, Hizbollah deliberately fired into Israel from civilian areas.\nNeither Rabin nor I had abandoned the idea of a large-scale military\noperation at some point, particularly if the cross-border rocket fire didn’t\nsubside, which for a while it did. But we were determined that, if and when we\ndid decide to strike, we would avoid anything on the scale of the 1982 war. It\nwould have to be with a clear, finite and achievable goal.\nThat point finally arrived in the summer of 1993. In addition to renewed\nKatyusha strikes, there was a series of deadly Hizbollah attacks in the first two\nweeks of July inside the security zone. Each used what was becoming the tactic\nof choice: a remotely detonated bomb by the side of the road on which our\nmilitary vehicles were travelling, followed by an ambush of soldiers who\nsurvived the blast. Six Israelis had been killed in all, making it the largest\nmonthly toll in three years. When I went to see Rabin with our plan for a\nmilitary response, I recognized the risks. It would be the largest military\noperation in Lebanon since the war. But I believed we could limit civilian\ncasualties, and that it was the only approach that might lead to a significant\nreduction in the missile attacks on northern Israel. I began with the assumption\nthat, left to its own devices, Hizbollah would have no incentive to stop firing.\nSince the two Arab governments with the potential to rein in the attacks –\nLebanon’s and above all Syria’s – were showing no interest in doing so, we had\nto find a way to hold them to account.\nThe operation I proposed was intended to send a message to Beirut and\nDamascus. It would not be a ground invasion as in 1982. Most of the attacks\nwould be from the air, in two stages. The first would target Hizbollah, both in\nsouthern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley further north, near the border with\n251\nSyria. We could halt at that stage, in the unlikely event Hizbollah showed signs\nof de-escalation. But if it didn’t, the air strikes would intensify. The aim was not\ntarget the nearly 250,000 Lebanese civilians who lived in the immediate border\narea. It was to use our attacks, along with leaflet drops and radio messages, to\nencourage them to flee north. My assessment was that this would bring pressure\non the Lebanese government and, through the Lebanese, on the real power in\nLebanon, the Syrians. I doubted Damascus would respond directly by telling\nHizbollah to cease fire. I did believe they’d be ready to engage with American\nefforts to stop the fighting, and that Rabin and the government could then secure\nterms we were prepared to accept.\nOn July 25, we began our heaviest air strikes since 1982. Far from producing\na sign of a climb-down by Hizbollah, it responded with intensified rocket fire.\nWe escalated over the following 24 hours, but still with no indication of any\nchange from Hizbollah. So as planned, we expanded our bombing to wider\nareas of south Lebanon. Sadly, some Lebanese civilians were killed, which I’m\nsure was a much greater cause of concern to us than to Hizbollah. Thankfully,\nhowever, the majority fled north. In south Lebanon, this meant that our jets and\nartillery had much greater freedom of operation against Hizbollah, which had\nnow lost its human shields. In Beirut, a government suddenly overwhelmed\nwith the need to provide shelter for the large number of refugees from the\nfighting did press Syrian President Assad to help bring it to an end. Critically,\nthe new Clinton Administration, especially Secretary of State Warren\nChristopher, reinforced that message.\nOur military operation lasted just a week. It did not end Hizbollah attacks on\nIsraeli troops in the security zone, something I think even most Israelis were\ncoming to realize was impossible as long as our soldiers remained in Lebanon.\nBut the rocket attacks on northern Israel did stop, with very few exceptions, for\na period that lasted nearly two years.\nThe intifada, however, had not stopped. Nor, as I knew from my increasingly\nfrequent meetings with Rabin, had the search for a way both to control the\nviolence, and seek out any realistic prospect of a political path to resolving our\nconflict with our Arab neighbors.\n252\nChapter Sixteen\nRabin had inherited a peace process, put in motion by the Bush\nAdministration after the Gulf War. But since both Prime Minister Shamir and\nour Arab enemies had reasons of procedure, politics or principle to resist the\ntalks, merely getting them off the ground had required the same combination of\ndeftness and determination President Bush had brought to assembling his\nwartime coalition and defeating Saddam. After a formal opening session in\nMadrid, the “bilateral tracks” – between Israel and negotiators from Syria,\nLebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians – had quickly stalemated and stalled.\nYitzhak came to office saying he was not interested in a peace process,\nwhich seemed to him a license for endless talk with no set endpoint, but in\npeacemaking. Since I had the good fortune to be part of the informal inner circle\nwith which he discussed the potential opportunities, pitfalls and frustrations\nalong the way, I know that he wasn’t assuming we could necessarily achieve a\npeace agreement with any of our neighbors. But after the twin shocks of the\nLebanon War and the Scud missiles, he was concerned that Israel would retreat\ninto a mix of political caution and military deterrence which he rightly believed\nwas short-sighted. He believed we needed at least to try to seize a “window of\nopportunity” with those enemies who were at least open to compromise, if only\nbecause we were facing new threats from enemies for whom talk was not even\nan option. An increasingly assertive Iran, with nuclear ambitions, was one. But\nthe intifada had also thrown up new Palestinian groups grounded not in\nnationalism, but fundamentalist Islam: Hamas in Gaza, which opposed Israel’s\npresence on any part of “Muslim Palestine,” and Islamic Jihad on the West\nBank. And in Lebanon, we were confronting the Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia\nfighters of Hizbollah.\nEach of us in the small group on whom Rabin relied for input on the peace\ntalks brought something different to the mix. In addition to me, there were four\nother generals: Uri Saguy, the head of military intelligence; Gadi Zohar, in\ncharge of civil administration for the West Bank and Gaza; my own former\nsayeret deputy, Danny Yatom, who was head of the central command; and\nRabin’s military aide, Kuti Mor. Also included were longtime political and\nmedia aide Eitan Haber, and another trusted political adviser thousands of miles\naway: Itamar Rabinovich, our ambassador in Washington and Israel’s leading\nSyria expert. But I’m sure we weren’t chosen just for our insights. It was\n253\nbecause we were people with whom Rabin felt comfortable – a counterpoint, I\nsuspect, to the old Labor Party rival whom he had made Foreign Minister,\nShimon Peres. Though the two men had grown to respect each another over the\nyears, Rabin neither trusted, nor much liked, Shimon. In fact, though Peres’s\nsupport inside Labor had secured him the foreign ministry, Rabin had stipulated\nthat all peace talks would remain under his control.\nYet as I’d discover nearly a decade later, when I was Prime Minister, even\nthe most carefully planned negotiating strategies were always subject to\nsetbacks, diversions, or simply what former British Prime Minister Harold\nMacmillan once called “events, dear boy, events.” Rabin’s initial plan was not\nto start with the Palestinians. He did feel it was essential to try to reach a\npolitical settlement with them. In one respect, the prospects looked slightly\nbetter than before. Arafat’s political position had been weakened: first by an\nintifada driven as much by local insurgents as by the PLO in faraway Tunis, and\nthen by his decision to break with his longtime Gulf Arab financial supporters\nand support Saddam Hussein the Gulf War. In 1988, as the entry price for a\nformal dialogue with the Bush Administration, he had also agreed to a statement\nin which he renounced terrorism and accepted the principle of a two-state peace\nagreement with Israel. Still, there remained a yawning gap between the “selfrule”\nenvisaged in the Camp David accords of 1978 and the Madrid conference,\nand the independent state the Palestinians wanted. Negotiations to bridge it were\nlikely to be fraught and long.\nSo he’d decided to begin with Syria. President Assad was obstinate, and\npublicly opposed to the idea of making peace with Israel. But he’d been in\npower for more than two decades and, crucially for Rabin, had lived up to the\nfew, indirect agreements Israel had made with him. The substance in any\nagreement, though politically difficult, was also more straightforward. We knew\nwhat Assad wanted: the recovery of the Golan Heights, in return for the\nabsolute minimum level of political normalization with Israel. We knew what\nwe wanted: security guarantees and assurances regarding water resources, and a\nfull and final peace treaty. For Rabin, there was an additional attraction in\nbeginning with Syria: if we did reach a deal with our main Arab enemy, the\npressure would intensify on the Palestinians to follow suit.\nThe dramatic turn of events that ultimately forced him to change tack began\nin January 1993 in the sitting room of a villa outside Oslo, at an ostensible\n“academic seminar” convened by the Norwegian diplomat Terje Larsen. It\nincluded two Israeli academics with personal ties to prominent Palestinians:\n254\nYair Hirschfeld, and the historian and former Haaretz journalist Ron Pundak.\nThree PLO officials were there, led by Arafat’s closest economic aide, Abu\nAla’a. Though both of the Israelis were friends of Yossi Beilin, a protégé of\nPeres and our deputy foreign minister, even Peres didn’t know about the\nmeeting until Yossi told him the following day. Rabin knew an hour later. I first\nlearned of it from Uri Saguy, after Unit 8200 intercepted Arabic-language\ntraffic concerning a briefing the Norwegians had given their Arab contacts. At\nfirst, even Peres was skeptical that the paper agreed at the “seminar” – calling\nfor international aid to the West Bank and Gaza on the scale of the Marshall\nPlan, and an initial Israeli withdrawal limited to Gaza – would lead to serious\nnegotiations. But Rabin authorized follow-up sessions in mid-February, late\nMarch and again in April. Our intelligence teams continued to provide detail,\nand occasional color. Uri Saguy and I even began to use the Arabic shorthand,\nfrom the intelligence reports, for the two Israeli academics. The burly, bearded\nYair Hirschfeld was “the bear”. The slighter Ron Pundak was “the mouse”. Yet\nthe main political impetus in driving the process forward came from two men\nwho were not there: on our side, Yossi Beilin, and for the Palestinians, Arafat’s\ntrusted diplomatic adviser, and eventual successor, Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu\nMazen.\nSince Rabin knew I was following the ostensibly secret talks, we discussed\nthem often. For quite a while, he remained dismissive. He believed the chances\nof a breakthrough were remote. He was also suspicious of the involvement of\nPeres and Beilin, whom he called “Shimon’s poodle”. And he deeply distrusted\nArafat. The PLO had been founded with the aim of “liberating” every inch of\nPalestine. The fact that Arafat had agreed to the Bush Administration’s demand\nto accept the principle of land-for-peace struck Rabin as mere sleight-of-hand.\nBy the third Oslo meeting, it was clear that the Palestinians were open to an\nagreement that would fall well short of “liberating Palestine”. Still, Rabin was\nleery. He tried briefly to return the focus to the stalemated Madrid-track talks\nwith the Palestinians. Yet when, with obvious PLO encouragement, the\nPalestinian negotiators stood their ground there, he seemed almost resigned to\nsupporting Oslo. When we discussed it, he used a battlefield metaphor. “When\nyou have to break through, you don’t necessarily know where you’ll succeed.\nYou try several places along the enemy’s lines. In the sector of the front where\nyou do succeed, you send in your other forces.” It was a matter of “reinforcing\nsuccess.”\n255\n“It’s the opposite in this case,” I replied. “In a battle, the enemy is doing\neverything it can to stop you. When you break through, it’s against their\nresistance. Here, the other side will choose to make it easiest for us in the place\nit prefers. If Arafat thinks he’ll get more from the Bear and the Mouse than from\nthe other talks, it’s hardly a surprise we’re finding that only Oslo seems to offer\na way forward.”\nRabin did make one more move, not so much in a bid to end the talks in Oslo\nas to slow them down and create a context more favorable for the kind of\nagreement he wanted. He shifted his attention to his original peacemaking\npriority: the Syrians. In an effort to remove a roadblock to even beginning\nserious talks, he offered the Americans what they would later call his “pocket\ndeposit.” He authorized Secretary of State Warren Christopher to tell Assad that\nWashington’s understanding of our position was that, assuming all our own\nnegotiating concerns were addressed, we accepted that peace with Syria would\ninclude withdrawing from the Golan. The formula was agreed in a meeting in\nIsrael between Rabin and the Clinton Administration’s Middle East negotiator,\nDennis Ross. Rabin didn’t tell Peres or other ministers about it, though Itamar\nRabinovich did know. I did as well. Since acceptance of the need for a\nwithdrawal had security implications, Rabin and I talked about it in detail\nbefore Ross’s visit. We formulated the “deposit” together. We used an English\nacronym: IAMNAM, “if all my needs are met.” The point was to convey to the\nSyrian president that if he addressed our requirements for a demilitarized zone\nand early warning facilities; non-interference with our critically important water\nsources; as well as a full peace including embassies, open borders and joint\neconomic projects, we knew the trade-off would be to return the Golan.\nIt was by diplomatic accident that the Syrian overture went nowhere. The\nreason even the Americans had called our proposal a “pocket deposit” was that\nit was to be kept in the Christopher’s pocket, to be pulled out as an American\nunderstanding of our position if he felt it might lead to a breakthrough. Our\nintelligence accounts of the Christopher-Assad talks, however, suggested it had\nbeen presented as a straight message from Rabin to the Syrian president, giving\nit the status of Israel’s new, formal opening position in negotiations.\nThe distinction may seem minor. But for Israel, it mattered greatly. In any\nagreement with Syria – or, indeed, the Palestinians – there was bound to an\nimbalance. Both parts of a “land-for-peace” exchange were important. But land\nwas not just the more tangible asset. Once given up, short of resorting to all-out\nwar, there was no going back. The “peace” part of the equation was more\n256\ndifficult. Genuine peace, and trust, would inevitably take years to reach fruition.\nThat was no mere academic problem in a conflict where, for decades, our\nenemies had defined Israel’s mere existence as illegitimate. The reason for\nRabin’s reluctance to have his “deposit” presented as a set negotiating position\nwas that it meant dealing away our only card – territory – before the hard\nquestions about peace had been answered. When he phoned Christopher, I don’t\nthink I’ve ever heard him as angry. That was not what we agreed, he insisted.\nHe said it had spoiled any prospect of serious negotiations on the peace side of\nthe balance. Christopher didn’t agree there had been any real damage, nor that\nAssad had failed to understand the context.\nIt might not have changed things anyway, since by this stage, the Oslo talks\nhad almost completed a draft agreement. In mid-August, Rabin gave Peres the\ngo-ahead to initial this “Declaration of Principles.” It provided for a period of\ninterim Palestinian self-government; the start of a phased Israeli withdrawal\nfrom Gaza and the West Bank with the creation of a Palestinian police force to\ndeal with internal security; and a commitment to reach a full peace agreement\nwithin five years. In early September, ahead of the formal signing of the Oslo\ndeclaration, there was an exchange of “letters of recognition” between Arafat\nand Rabin. Arafat’s letter also renounced “terrorism and other acts of violence”\nand declared invalid “those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny\nIsrael’s right to exist.” A few days later, the signing ceremony was hosted by\nPresident Clinton in Washington. Thus emerged the famous photo of Rabin and\nArafat shaking hands, on either side of Clinton, who was beaming, arms\noutstretched in conciliation. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In\nthis case, you needed barely a dozen. Rabin’s demeanor, his posture, the look\non his face, all seemed to say: “I would rather be shaking the hand of anyone on\nearth than Arafat.” Still, the image was on front pages worldwide. The news\nstories spoke of a new spirit of hope. Now that these old enemies had grasped\nhands, surely a full peace agreement was within reach.\nMy feeling, as I watched it on TV in the kirya, was more guarded. I did hope\nfor peace, of course. I also recognized that the signing on the White House lawn\nwas just a beginning, and that my role would be to ensure that Israel’s security\nneeds were met under whatever formal peace agreement might eventually be\nreached. And the security omens were hardly encouraging. Despite Oslo,\nPalestinian attacks were continuing. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other dissident\nfactions saw Arafat’s concessions as treachery, and were setting out to drive\nhome that point with violence.\n257\n* * *\nYet as I approached my final year as chief of staff in early 1994, we were\nsuddenly confronted by an appalling act of Israeli violence: mass murder,\ncommitted by a West Bank settler. Terrorism, no less than the worst Arab\nattacks on Israeli civilians. The settler was named Baruch Goldstein, a\nphysician, who lived in Kiryat Arba. One of the first post-1967 Jewish\nsettlements, it sat on a hill outside the West Bank town of Hebron. At the heart\nof Hebron lay the burial place of the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish\nfaith: Abraham and Sarah; Isaac and Rebecca; Jacob and Leah. Since Abraham\nis also revered as a prophet in Islam and a mosque had stood on the site for\nnearly a thousand years, our post-1967 arrangements set out separate times of\nworship for Muslims and Jews. Goldstein chose to attack during a holiday\nperiod for both faiths: Purim for the Jews and the Muslim holy month of\nRamadan. He arrived shortly after the Muslims’ Friday prayers began on the\nmorning on February 25. He was dressed in his reserve army uniform and was\ncarrying an automatic rifle. He opened fire on a group of nearly 800 Palestinian\nworshipers. He had killed 29 and wounded 125 others by the time several of his\nintended victims knocked him unconscious and beat him to death.\nI rushed to Sde Dov airport in north Tel Aviv, a few minutes from the kirya,\nand boarded a helicopter for the old British fort near Hebron, used by the\nJordanians until 1967 and now Israeli headquarters. After visiting the scene of\nthe killings, I sought out local Palestinian leaders, to voice my condolences and\nthe sense of outrage I shared over what had happened, and to urge them to do all\nthey could to maintain calm. I then went to Kiryat Arba and conveyed the same\nmessage.\nOur immediate task was to prevent more deaths, on either side. It was a\nfrustrating, and violent, week. Protests reminiscent of the first days of the\nintifada erupted around the West Bank, in Gaza, in east Jerusalem and in several\nArab neighborhoods and towns inside Israel. While I had no trouble\nunderstanding the Palestinians’ anger, I also had a responsibility to prevent the\nviolence spiraling out of control. We turned to the same tools we’d used at the\nbeginning of the uprising – though with even greater emphasis on the need for\nsoldiers to use the only the necessary force to restore order, and to avoid causing\nfatalities wherever possible. We closed off the West Bank. We imposed curfews\n258\non the main West Bank and Gaza towns and refugee camps. We also imposed a\ncurfew on Kiryat Arba and, for the first time, were given the authority to use\nadministrative detention orders not just against Palestinians, but specific Jewish\nsettlers. We arrested about a half-dozen leaders of Kach, the far-right, anti-Arab\npolitical movement founded by the American Rabbi Meir Kahane, of which\nBaruch Goldstein had also been a member. Still, there were repeated clashes\nanyway – and dozens of deaths as a result – before things finally began to\nsubside a week or so later.\nThe massacre had made me feel more strongly than ever that our\nresponsibility to protect the security of the settlers could not extend to allowing\nthem to defy the government or the law. The principle would be put to the test\nwithin a few weeks. A settlement near Hebron, called Tel Rumeida, had been\nset up without government approval in 1984. As part of the response to\nGoldstein killings, Rabin was thinking of closing it down. That prompted a\nnumber of right-wing rabbis to issue a formal religious ruling against any such\naction. Rabin called me in to ask whether it would be operationally possible to\ndismantle Tel Rumeida and remove the settlers. I said yes, by sending in a\nSayeret Matkal force after midnight, as long as news of the operation did not\nleak ahead of time. “We’ll take over the area, close it off and get control.”\nGiven the tensions in the wake of the massacre, I did add that I couldn’t promise\nthat our soldiers would hold fire. “There are people in there with weapons,” I\nsaid. “If someone shoots at them, they will shoot back.”\n“Should I do it?” he asked me. Maybe I should have given him an answer.\nBut I didn’t feel it was my place to add to the pressures around what was clearly\na finely balanced call, especially since my inclination would have been to tell\nhim to go ahead. I said it was something only he could decide. “What I can tell\nyou is that we can do it.” When I left, my sense was that he was sufficiently\nangry over what had happened in Hebron that he felt it essential to draw a line –\nthe line of law – over what settlers were allowed to do. But the Passover holiday\nwas now a couple of days away. I think what happened is that he realized the\noperation would not be possible until after the holiday period. By then, he was\nconcerned he would have lost the clear political logic for moving against Tel\nRumeida. The settlement has remained in place, a flashpoint in the conflict\nbetween settlers and Palestinians in the area around Hebron.\nThe wider repercussions, and the controversy, from the massacre\nreverberated widely. Rabin and his cabinet immediately decided to establish an\ninquiry, under Supreme Court Chief Justice Meir Shamgar. It would look into\n259\nevery aspect of the killings – including any failings by the army, the Shin Bet,\nthe police or other authorities that might have allowed the tragedy to happen.\nThe commission interviewed dozens of witnesses, Israeli and Palestinian, in 31\nseparate sessions. I knew early on that the inquiry would throw up difficult\nissues. I was especially upset to learn that two soldiers and three border guards\nscheduled for guard duty at the mosque had shown up late on the morning of the\nkillings. By the time I testified in late March, the inquiry had heard from a range\nof senior and local commanders and individual soldiers. A picture had emerged\nof a series of security breakdowns, equipment malfunctions, oversights and\nconfusion around the site where the murders took place.\nI did not try to dodge the fact that security lapses around the Cave of the\nPatriarchs that day had contributed to what happened. In addition to the fact that\nthe guard unit was not at full strength until after the murders took place, several\nof the security cameras weren’t working. I acknowledged that if the cameras\nand the guards had done their job, at the very least some lives might be have\nsaved. Yet I also made the point that this specific act of mass murder was\nsomething the army could not have anticipated. I told the commissioners to\nremember that they were judging things after the fact. They knew how the\ntragedy had ended. In the context in which we were operating, the prospect of\nan Israeli settler, a reserve soldier, walking into a place of worship and\ndeliberately killing defenseless Palestinians had come as “a bolt from the blue.”\nThe commission’s report did not apportion blame to any of the army officers\nor commanders. But an inescapable conclusion from the testimony of the many\nwitnesses was that the way in which we’d become conditioned to viewing the\nsettlers had blinded us to the kind of crime Goldstein had committed. Even\nbefore I testified, I’d been disturbed to hear soldiers saying that even if they had\nseen him shooting a Palestinian, their orders were not to open fire on a settler,\nso they wouldn’t have intervened. When asked about this by the commission, I\nsaid it was a fundamental misunderstanding of our rules of engagement. “In no\ncase is there, nor can there be, an army order that says it is forbidden to shoot at\na settler even if he is shooting at others... A massacre is a massacre. You don’t\nneed special orders to know what to do.”\nYet I also knew that the soldiers’ “misunderstanding” was all too\nunderstandable. As I acknowledged to the inquiry, the army on the West Bank\nand Gaza was predisposed to see Palestinians who were carrying weapons as\npotential terrorists, especially since the outbreak of the intifada. The settlers, by\ncontrast, were assumed to be carrying arms in self-defense. One lesson I took\n260\nfrom the massacre was that the mix of Jewish settlers, some of whom felt they\nwere on a messianic mission to resettle all of Biblical Israel, and restive\nPalestinians who wanted sovereignty and control over their own lives was\npotentially toxic, for both sides. Ideally, the process which had begun with Oslo\nmight start to disentangle it, though I remained far from confident that anything\nresembling full peace would come any time soon.\n* * *\nRabin, and even more acutely Shimon Peres, believed it was important to\npress ahead with the opening phase of the handover of Israeli authority mapped\nout by Oslo. In May 1994, a draft of the so-called “Gaza and Jericho First”\nagreement was completed. Once it was ratified, the five-year interim period\nwould begin, with further withdrawals and parallel negotiations on the\n“permanent status” of the territories. In this first step, Israel would transfer civil\nauthority in Gaza Strip and the Jordan Valley town of Jericho to the\nPalestinians, and local security would be in the hands of a newly created\nPalestinian police force.\nMy primary concern, and my responsibility, was the security provisions in\nthe agreement, since the Israeli army retained its role in charge of overall\nsecurity. When I went to see Rabin a few days before the cabinet meeting to\napprove the Gaza-Jericho agreement, I told him I was worried that it left room\nfor potentially serious misunderstandings, friction and even clashes on the\nground. There was no clear definition of how our soldiers would operate\nalongside the new local police in the event of a terror attack, violence by Hamas\nor Islamic Jihad, or, for that matter, a car crash involving an Israeli and a\nPalestinian. He agreed this needed to be addressed, although it was clear he\nintended to do so with Arafat, via the Americans, not by reopening and delaying\nthe formal agreement.\nBut I had a deeper concern about the entire Oslo Agreement, which I also\nnow raised with Rabin. I did not doubt the importance of reaching a political\nagreement, and ideally a peace treaty, with the Palestinians. But I’d now read\nthe Oslo Declaration in greater detail, and discussed it with lawyer friends of\nmine. I’d also re-read the 1978 Camp David framework on which the self-rule\nprovisions were based. The endpoint was pretty clear, just as it had been at\nCamp David: Palestinian authority over the West Bank and Gaza, defined as a\n261\n“single territorial unit” under Oslo. In essence, and very probably in name, this\nmeant a Palestinian state. I wasn’t opposed to that in principle, if it was in return\nfor a full and final peace. But the Oslo process meant that we would be handing\nback land, and control over security, in an ever-larger portion of territory before\nwe’d reached any so-called permanent-status agreement. In fact, before we even\nknew whether that would prove possible. It wasn’t “land for peace.” It was land\nfor the promise, or maybe only the hope, of peace. It was the same problem\nYitzhak had faced over the Americans’ misuse of our “pocket deposit” on the\nGolan. I realized that, having come this far with Oslo, neither he nor the\ngovernment was likely to back away from approving the Gaza-Jericho accord.\nBut he did say he thought the points I’d raised were important, which I took as\nmeaning he was comfortable with my raising it with the cabinet.\nI spoke near the end of the four-hour cabinet meeting to ratify the Gaza-\nJericho plan. The ministers seemed attentive as I ran through the security\nconcerns I’d raised with Rabin, even nodding when I compared the agreement’s\nsecurity provisions to “a piece of Swiss cheese, only with more holes.” But then\nI said that I wanted to say a few words which I recognized were beyond my\nresponsibility as chief of staff. “I’m speaking just as an Israeli citizen,” I told\nthe cabinet, “and as a former head of military intelligence.” Referring to specific\nprovisions in Oslo, and in the Camp David framework agreed by Begin and\nSadat 15 years earlier, I said it was important for ministers to realize that, even\nthough permanent-status issues were yet to be resolved, “you will be taking us\nnearly the whole way toward creating a Palestinian state, based on the\ninternationally accepted reading of Camp David.” The reaction to my comments\nwas a mix of defensiveness and hostility. In the latter camp were ministers from\nRabin’s left-wing coalition partners, Meretz, who seemed especially angry\nwhen I quoted from Camp David. The Prime Minister motioned them for calm.\n“Ehud had a responsibility to talk about security questions, and we had a\nresponsibility to listen. As for his additional remarks, they are not a surprise to\nme,” he said. “He made these points to me, and I said he could repeat them here.\nIt is right that he should raise them.” He said there was no need for ministers to\nagree with me, but that it was proper that the points I’d raised should be heard.\nMany clearly didn’t agree with me, or simply believed the Gaza-Jericho\nagreement still had to be ratified, which it was. But my remarks did lay the\ngroundwork for my objection to the next, more far-reaching stage in the Oslo\nprocess barely a year later. By then, I was no longer chief of staff. I was a\nmember of Rabin’s cabinet.\n262\n* * *\nIt was still my responsibility to ensure that Gaza-Jericho was implemented,\nand that the initial withdrawals and redeployments went ahead smoothly. And\nthey did. But I also was soon playing a part in a renewed effort by Rabin to use\nthe momentum of Oslo to achieve peace agreements with our other Arab\nneighbors: the Syrians, although he knew that would be tough, and first the\nJordanians. I would always have had some role, by virtue of the need for a chief\nof staff to weigh in on security issues. But as Yitzhak had done from the start,\nhe involved me and others in his inner political circle in wider discussions on\nthe whole range of negotiating issues. Especially after Oslo, he seemed\ndetermined to keep Peres’s role to an absolute minimum.\nNo peace talks are ever completely straightforward, but the process with\nJordan was very close to that. The main issues on the Jordanian side involved\nensuring a proper share of scarce water supplies; and dealing with Israel’s de\nfacto control of a fairly large area near the southern end of our border. A\nnumber of kibbutzim and moshavim were farming the land there. But under the\npost-1948 armistice, it had been allocated to Jordan. Israel’s priorities were to\nput in place a fully open relationship of peace and cooperation, and to get\nassurances Jordan would not allow its territory to be used by Palestinian groups\nto launch terror attacks.\nI was struck by how much more easily compromises can be found if you\ntruly trust the party on the other side. From my earlier meeting with Hussein in\nEngland, before the Gulf War, I’d been impressed by the king’s thoughtful and\nmeasured, yet warm and open, demeanor. That, in itself, inspired trust. But ever\nsince 1967, even in times of high tension, Israel and Jordan had kept open secret\nlines of communication, and both sides had generally demonstrated a shared\ndesire, and ability, to steer clear of conflict. The main trade-off in the search for\na formal peace turned out to be not too difficult. We agreed to ensure water\nprovision, and to accept Jordanian sovereignty over the 1949 armistice area, in\nreturn for which the king allowed the Israelis who had been working the land to\nstay in place as lessees. On the final Wednesday of October 1994, near our\nborder crossing in the Arava desert, I watched as Rabin, King Hussein, and\nPresident Clinton formally seal the full “Treaty of Peace Between the State of\nIsrael and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.”\n263\nSyria was always going to be harder. But Rabin had moved past his anger\nover the “pocket deposit”, and we began a new effort via the Americans. Our\naim was to lay out a comprehensive, staged proposal to trade nearly the entire\nGolan for peace. With Rabin, Itamar Rabinovich and the rest of the team, we\nput together a framework limiting Syria’s military presence on the Heights. We\nenvisaged phasing out the restrictions as Syria took steps toward the kind of\npeace which had proved possible with Egypt and Jordan. But indirect exchanges\nin the autumn of 1994 produced little progress. In December, Rabin proposed to\nthe Americans that I meet with a Syrian representative, and President Assad\nagreed. Later that month, I was sent to Washington for talks with Syria’s\nambassador, Walid Muallem. With the Americans’ Mideast envoy, Dennis\nRoss, as host, we met in Blair House across the street from the White House.\nI began by explaining the security provisions we envisaged for the Golan,\nwhich included early-warning provisions, force limitations and other means of\nsafeguarding Israel against any surprise attack. Muallem’s response was\nformulaic, almost icy, with no indication he was ready to discuss any of the\nspecifics, much less offer ideas of his own. But then Dennis led us out into the\ngarden, where the atmosphere, if sadly not the weather, was a bit warmer. I told\nAmbassador Muallem I believed Israel’s issues with Syria ought to be\nresolvable. Both sides understood the broad terms of an eventual peace. But we\nneeded a context of trust in which to negotiate. President Assad, and we as well,\nwere always going to be reluctant formally to commit ourselves to a position\nuntil each side was be satisfied that the other side understood its core needs.\nPolitically, both sides also faced constraints. “In formal meetings, a record is\ntaken and negotiators have to explain and justify every last word back home,” I\nsaid. “I think our negotiators can get further in conversations like the one we’re\nhaving now.” Though Muallem nodded agreement, he did not explicitly say he\nbelieved that informal exchanges were the way forward. Still, he did obviously\npass back a broadly positive message to Damascus. Before the Blair House\ndiscussion, our understanding had been there would probably be a kind of\nmirror arrangement for a follow-up meeting: between our ambassador in\nWashington, Itamar Rabinovich, and a high-ranking army officer from the\nSyrian side. Instead, we received word that Assad wanted me to meet directly\nwith General Himat Shihabi, who was not only my counterpart as Syrian chiefof-staff\nbut Assad’s oldest and closest political ally and the effective numbertwo\nman in the régime.\nGeneral Shihabi and I met over a period of two days at Blair House. He had\ngreater authority, and thus a greater sense of self-assurance, than the\n264\nambassador. But not for the last time in negotiations with Syria, any real\nprogress was blocked by an apparent combination of misunderstanding and\nmiscommunication. The discussions were lively. Shihabi had served as Syria’s\nliaison officer with the UN force set up along the cease-fire line after the 1948\nwar. “Go check with the UN,” he said at our first meeting. “You’ll see almost\nall the exchanges of fire in the late 1950s were provoked by Israel.” I didn’t\nrespond directly, though I did note it was the Syrians who had tried to divert\nwater from the Jordan River in the early fifties. “You did it first,” he retorted.\nSo it continued. Only later did we learn that while Muallem had sent back a\ngenerally encouraging impression from our garden talks, and his conclusion that\nIsrael was ready for substantive talks, he had neglected to convey our\nexpectation that any early progress would occur in informal exchanges. The\nresult was probably to raise General Shihabi’s expectations, which made him\nreluctant to show any real engagement. After a phone call with Rabin after our\nfirst day of talks, I became equally cautious. He agreed that we wanted to avoid\na repeat of our experience with the Golan “deposit”. We did not want to put\nconcessions on the record before we got an indication that the Syrians were\ngenuinely ready for peace talks.\nStill, the fact that we’d established the precedent of a “chief-of-staff\nchannel” was a step forward. My successor as ramatkal, Amnon Lipkin, would\nmeet again with Shihabi in early 1995.\n* * *\nI was confident Amnon was inheriting an army stronger, better prepared and\nbetter equipped than at any time since the Six-Day War. We also had peace\ntreaties not only with Egypt, but now Jordan, and none of the substantive issues\nwith the Syrians seemed insurmountable.\nBut the main security challenges were the unconventional ones. In the long\nterm, a resurgent Iraq, and very likely Iran, might make strides towards getting\nnuclear weapons. There was every sign that Hizbollah in Lebanon; and Hamas,\nIslamic Jihad and their supporters in Gaza and the West Bank, would escalate\nviolence and terror. As the negotiations with Jordan were entering their final\nphase in early October, a further Hamas attack – this one, a kidnapping – had\nbrought home that threat. On Sunday, October 9, Hamas men dressed as\nOrthodox Jews abducted an off-duty soldier named Nahshon Wachsman near\n265\nLod. Two days later, Israeli television received a videotape showing the 19-\nyear-old, hands and feet bound, pleading for his life in return for the release of\nthe founder of Hamas, whom we had arrested and jailed in 1989. “The group\nfrom Hamas kidnapped me,” he said. “They are demanding the release of\nSheikh Ahmed Yassin and another 200 people from Israeli prison. If their\ndemands are not met, they will execute me on Friday at 8 pm.”\nAs soon as we got word he was missing, I spoke to Rabin. Since we assumed\nhe was being held in Gaza, I ordered a unit from Sayeret Matkal to head south\nand co-ordinate efforts to locate him with the Shin Bet and the southern\ncommand. But it gradually became clear he might be much closer to where he’d\nbeen seized. The Shin Bet got a description of the kidnappers’ car, and found it\nwas a rental that had been picked up and returned in east Jerusalem. They\ntracked down the man who rented it. A little before dawn the morning of\nOctober 14, barely 12 hours before the Hamas deadline, Shin Bet established\nthat Wachsman was being held in a village on the road to Ramallah, north of\nJerusalem, in a house owned by a Palestinian who was living abroad.\nThe hostage soldier’s ordeal was made even worse by the fact his mother,\nEsther, was a Holocaust survivor, born in a displaced-persons camp in Germany\nat the end of the war. Rabin had been ready to approve a rescue attempt from\nthe outset, assuming we could locate Wachsman and come up with a plan that\nmight work. But as with Entebbe, he said that if we couldn’t be reasonably\nconfident of success, we would negotiate. Now that we knew where\nWaschsman was being held, I ordered Shaul Mofaz, the commander with\nresponsibility for the West Bank, to prepare for a possible rescue.\nBefore going to brief Rabin, I arranged for another commando unit to begin\nvisible preparations for an operation in Gaza, in an effort to reassure Hamas we\nstill believed he was being held there. Assuming we could retain the element of\nsurprise, there were several things working in our favor. The house was\nrelatively isolated. It was in an area where Israel, not the incipient Palestinian\nauthorities, still had control. And Sayeret Matkal had expertise and experience\nin this kind of mission. Still, no plan could be foolproof. I told Rabin that the\nfact Hamas was holding a single hostage meant that if our assault teams were\ndelayed for any reason at all, the kindappers might kill him before we got in.\nBut I said we had to weigh the risks of not acting. We were no longer trying to\nfind a missing soldier. We knew where he was. We had a unit ready. Unless\nHamas relented, he was facing death within hours. In those circumstances, the\n266\nprecedent of doing nothing would, in my view, be very serious. I recommended\nthat he approve the operation, and Rabin agreed.\nI attended the final briefing shortly afterwards. I was impressed by the\ndetermined faces of the men in the two sayeret teams. One of the officers was\n23-year-old Nir Poraz, whom I remembered from operational briefings in the\nkirya on previous sayeret missions. Wachsman was being held in a room on the\nfirst floor. The commandos would simultaneously detonate explosives on three\ndoors: at the front, on the side, and a third one leading through a kitchen to the\nroom where the kidnappers had their hostage. The attack began fifteen minutes\nbefore the Hamas deadline. The explosive charges went off, but only the one in\nthe front blew open the door. Poraz and his team rushed in, but one of the\nkidnappers opened fire, killing him and wounding six others. The other team\nhad by now made it to the first floor. But despite firing at the metal lock, they\nhad trouble getting the door to open. By the time they got in, Wachsman had\nbeen killed, shot in the neck and chest.\nI was in the command post a few hundred yards away. I called Rabin and\nthen went to see him in the kirya. The head of personnel for the army had gone\nto see the Wachsman family and break the news to them. Now, we had to tell\nthe country. Rabin and I appeared on television together. Rabin insisted –\nwrongly – on saying he bore full responsibility. What had gone wrong, I had\ntried to impress on him, was not the decision to attempt the rescue. It was the\nrescue itself. That was not his responsibility. It was mine.\nThe next day, I visited Wachsman’s parents, and tried to convey how painful\nthe failed rescue was to me, Rabin and every one else involved. I was inspired\nand humbled by their response. His father had told a reporter he wanted to\nconvey his condolences to the parents of Nir Poraz. “This added loss has shaken\nme terribly,” he said. He told me he also believed that the Prime Minister had\napproved the rescue using his best judgement on the information that he had\navailable. I spent time separately speaking to Mrs Wachsman. I tried to explain\nthat in fighting an enemy like Hamas, people who not just threaten to kill but\nhad proven they had no hesitation in doing so, I’d felt there was no choice but to\nattempt the rescue. I admitted we’d known the risks. But we’d tried to do the\nright thing, both for the country and her son. I think she understood, though I\nknew that nothing could alter the terrible sadness of her loss. The pain would\ntake years to heal. Some part of it never would. Still, I felt it was important she\nand her husband know that we, too, felt their loss. For years afterwards, Nava\nand I continued to visit them.\n267\nBy then, however, I was no longer chief of staff. In fact, barely ten weeks\nafter the kidnapping, I handed over to Amnon Lipkin. I left the kirya proud of\nall I had sought to accomplish during my 36 years in uniform. I also realized\nthere had also been failures and setbacks, none more painfully fresh than our\ninability to rescue Nahshon Wachsman. But I was about to find that the area of\nIsraeli life which I now chose to enter – national politics – could be a battlefield\nas well. And that when trouble hit, even your allies sometimes ducked for cover.\n268\nChapter Seventeen\nIt was an ambush. It came in July 1995, six months after I’d left the army\nand only days before I was expected to named as Interior Minister in Yitzhak\nRabin’s government. The effect, and clearly the intention, was to threaten my\npolitical career before it had even begun – by reviving, and lying about, the\ntragic training accident at the Negev army base of Tze’elim, during our\npreparations for the operation against Saddam Hussein.\nWhen the “story” broke, I was nearly five thousand miles away. I was\naccompanying Nava’s brother, Doron Cohen, on a business trip he was making\nto China – and savoring my last few days as a private citizen between my three\ndecades of military service and my entry into politics. I’d got a hint of the storm\nthat was about to engulf me a few days before we left for the Far East. It was a\nletter from a reporter at Yeidot Achronot, Israel’s largest-selling newspaper,\nwith a list of questions about Tze’elim. The thrust of the questions made clear\nthe case Yediot seemed intent on building: that after the live missile strike\nwhich killed the Sayeret Matkal men, I had abandoned the injured and\nimmediately “fled” to Tel Aviv. I probably should have answered the letter. But\nI assumed even rudimentary checks would reveal the story to be false. I’d had\nsimilar questions from a TV journalist a few months earlier. I did phone him\nback. I explained the true details of what had happened. I suggested he talk to\nothers who were there, like Amnon Lipkin, the current chief of staff and my\nformer deputy, to confirm my account. The story was dropped.\nBut Yediot evidently decided not to let the facts get in the way of the\n“exclusive” it ran in its weekend edition on July 7. Under a banner headline – an\nundeniably clever Hebrew pun, Ehud Barakh, “Ehud Ran Away” – it accused\nme of having stood by, paralyzed with shock, when the missiles struck and then,\nas other officers tended to the wounded, rushed away by helicopter.\nDoron and I were having dinner in Beijing when Nava phoned. She’d just\nseen the newspaper story, and read it to me. I’d never been angrier. As best I\ncould work out, it had been concocted from a patchwork of accounts long after\nthe fact. To the extent the notion of my “fleeing” had been raised, I could only\nimagine that Yediot’s “sources” had misunderstood the arrival of the first\nmedical helicopter, when the pilot was unable to see us and flew on before\nreturning a couple of minutes later. But in every single detail about my actions\nafter the tragedy occurred, it was a pure and simple lie.\n269\nI was not just angry, but frustrated at my inability to rebut the story in\nperson. Doron and I immediately made arrangements to return to Israel early,\nwhich, since there was no direct air connection, meant finding the first flight out\nthrough London. But before we left, Nava phoned again, almost sputtering in\nfury. She told me that she’d just received a call from Aliza Goren, Rabin’s\nmedia spokesperson. “Does Ehud know about the Yediot story?” she’d asked.\nWhen Nava said yes, Aliza told her: “It is important that Ehud knows that we\nare not going to get involved in getting him out of this.”\nWelcome to politics, I thought. Rabin knew that the story was untrue. I’d still\nbeen in Tze’elim when I’d phoned him about what had happened. He knew I’d\nremained there to order in the medical helicopters and arrange for the\nevacuation of the wounded before returning to brief him. Still, he did not say a\nsingle word in public – nor, for that matter, speak to me – as the controversy\ncontinued to gather force.\nDuring our stopover in London, I sat with Doron and talked through how to\nget my voice heard. I telephoned Yoni Koren, the officer who’d been my top\naide in the kirya and whom I’d asked to work for me in the Interior Ministry,\nassuming I now actually got there. I told him to phone Amnon Lipkin and say\nthat I had expected him to answer the fabrications. Not only had he and I been\nat the site of tragedy together. We’d left together, on the same helicopter.\nAmnon did now issue a statement saying that he knew Yediot’s allegations were\nwrong. But the story had been allowed to stand for too long. His rebuttal caused\nbarely a ripple.\nAs I read the latest Israeli newspapers before landing in Tel Aviv, I found\nthat at least I wasn’t totally on my own. Reporters had been phoning politicians\nfor comment. Most responded like weathervanes, going with the prevailing\nwind, which was gusting against me. But three Knesset members dissented. One\nwas Ori Or, a friend even before we’d both gone into the army, and who had\nnow joined Labor. The other two were leading members of Likud: Dan Meridor\nand Benny Begin, Menachem Begin’s son. All three said they were sure the\nallegations were false. Did they know the details about the accident, they were\nasked. No, they replied, they didn’t need to. They knew me.\nNow all I had to do was convince the rest of the country. It had been nearly a\nweek since the Yediot’s “exposé”. It was Yoni Koren who passed on a request\nfrom Channel 1 television, our equivalent of the BBC. They were proposing that\nI appear with Nissim Mishal, the man who had interviewed me 10 years earlier,\nat the urging of Rabin’s political aide, on my first TV appearance. For Mishal,\n270\nthe interview would be a journalistic coup. For me, it was a risk. He was a\nfamously combative questioner, a bit like Sam Donaldson at White House\nbriefings, or Jeremy Paxman and John Humphreys in Britain.\nOn the night of July 13, I drove to the television studio in Tel Aviv. Mishal\nconfronted me with Yediot’s version of events. I was angry, and showed it.\n“This report was not some night editor’s mishap,” I said. “It was authorized by\nthe highest levels of a mass-circulation newspaper which is power-drunk,\ncorrupted by power, and manipulative. The so-called ‘story’ was an amateurish\nand distorted depiction of a chief-of-staff who sees wounded soldiers, turns his\nback, deserts them and flies away. That is an evil, vain falsehood.” As Mishal\npressed me about the allegation that I had fled, I cited, by name, other officers\nwho had been there with me and had confirmed precisely the opposite. I had left\nTze’elim, along with Amnon Lipkin, a full 50 minutes after the missiles struck,\nI said. And only after the helicopters had arrived, the injuries had been treated\nand the choppers were evacuating the wounded. “A chief of staff’s job is not to\ntreat the wounded, when others are doing that already,” I added. My\nresponsibility was “to keep my head, and ensure a safe and speedy medical\nevacuation.” That was what I’d done. “I’ve given years of my life to serving this\ncountry,” I said. “I have been shot at. I have shot men dead from as close as I\nam to you now. How did the hand that wrote these things against me not\ntremble?”\nIt was certainly high drama. But it was not an act. The way that I’d gone\nafter Yediot prompted some pundits to suggest my skin was too thin. One\ncommentator even said I was obviously not suited to politics. Yet what mattered\nmost to me was what the rest of Israel felt: people who were not reporters or\neditors, commentators or politicians. Opinion polls the day afterwards showed\nthat something like 80 percent of Israelis believed what I’d said. I think this was\nonly partly due to the details of the argument I made. When you’re under such\nclose, direct scrutiny, I’m sure viewers have an innate sense of whether what\nthey are hearing is the truth.\nAlmost as soon as I’d got home from the interview, the phone rang. It was\nsomeone who, of course, already knew it was the truth: Yitzhak Rabin. “Ehud,”\nhe said, “you did well. Let’s move forward.”\n* * *\n271\nI later worked out why he’d wanted to steer clear of the whole thing. Yediot\nhad been planning the story for months. It had been ready to go with it earlier,\nwhen it was assumed I would be joining the government as early as April. The\neditors had held it to coincide with my arrival as a minister. That, I suppose,\nwas simply what newspapers did. But it turned out that at least two influential\nLabor politicians had played a part in steering Yediot toward the story, and\nurging the newspaper to run with it: Haim Ramon, a veteran party figure and\ncabinet minister, though he’d quit the government the year before over the\nparty’s failure to follow through on health-policy reform; and Shimon Shevess,\none of Rabin’s top advisers. Ramon would later say that they hadn’t wanted to\n“kill Barak” as a new minister. “Just fire some bullets at this legs, so he’ll enter\npolitics with a limp.” It was a way of cutting me down to size.\nI suppose that was understandable. I was by no means the only former\ngeneral to enter Israeli politics. Other chiefs-of-staff had gone on to play\nprominent roles in government: Dayan, Motta Gur and, of course, Rabin. But\nthe fact that I was going directly into the cabinet, and so soon after leaving the\narmy, was seen by the Israeli media – and a number of Labor politicians – as a\nreflection of my close relationship with Rabin. Some commentators had even\nbeen speculating I might eventually be a candidate to succeed him as party\nleader and Prime Minister.\nIt was true that Rabin had personally urged me to join the government,\nstarting with a lighthearted remark only days after I’d ended my term as chief of\nstaff. It was at a farewell organized by my staff. The event began with film clips\nfrom my years in the army, and a series of entertaining cameos from men I’d\nserved with and led. Rabin spoke at the end. He said he’d recently been on an\nofficial visit to South Korea. He’d met the president, who told him he was the\nfirst Korean leader not to have been an army general. Rabin said he’d replied\nthat he was the first Israeli Prime Minister who was a general. Then, smiling\nand looking straight at me, he added: “Nu, Ehud?”\nI did want to join his government. But I had been in the army since the age\nof seventeen and was now in my early fifties. For my family’s sake, as well as\nmy own, I had figured on taking a year or two to explore other things. Two\noptions appealed to me especially. One was business. My brother-in-law, in\naddition to having a successful law practice, was involved in a number of\nbusiness ventures, and we’d discussed areas we might jointly explore. But I had\nalso received offers from think tanks in the United States.\n272\nDespite Rabin’s quip about ex-generals and Prime Ministers, I was surprised\nwhen, a couple of days later, he asked me to come see him. He smiled as I\nentered his office. Then he said: “Ehud, now that you are out of uniform. I\nwould be glad to see you come into politics, together with us, and be a member\nof the government.” He said he’d discussed it with Peres. “It’s a joint\ninvitation.” Though I did, of course, say yes, I also told him I was planning to\ntake some time off, probably at first with a think tank in the US. Though I\nwasn’t exactly sure about the legal provisions for officers leaving the army, I\nreminded him that there was a set period of time during which they could not\nenter politics. He replied, a bit enigmatically, that he would be sending an\n“operative” to talk to me further about the timing.\nThe operative was Giora Einy, a uniquely important figure in Labor because\nhe was trusted both by Rabin and Peres. I liked him immediately. Throughout\nmy years in politics, I would come to rely on him for his experience, good\nhumor and good judgement. He did know about the rules for former army\npeople going into politics: there was a 100-day moratorium. “Rabin wants you\nimmediately,” he said. “I guess we’ll tell him that ‘immediately’ will have to\nmean sometime in April.” In fact, I told Giora that I’d hoped it would be much\nlonger. So we agreed that in order to give me at least a few months in the US,\nhe’d tell Rabin he could get in touch at any time from March 1996 with his\ninvitation to join the cabinet. As soon as he did so, I would formally cut my ties\nwith the military, meaning I could join the government in the summer.\nNava, the girls and I left for Washington in January. I joined the Center for\nStrategic and International Studies and was given the delightfully overwrought\ntitle of Distinguished Visiting Statesman and Senior Associate. The reason the\nCSIS had invited me was to write and speak on the Middle East. About two\nmonths in, I presented a paper. I began by welcoming the constellation of\nchanges which seemed to offer at least an opportunity for stability, security and\npeace: the unravelling of the Soviet Union; the Oslo Agreement; the peace\ntreaty with Jordan and the continuing talks with the Syrians. As long as we had\npartners committed to reaching an agreement, I believed Israel would be ready\n“to consider major compromise and to take upon ourselves significant\ncalculated risks.” But with a frankness which seems surprising even to me in\nretrospect, I delivered much the same message as I had to ministers on the\npotential dangers inherent in the Oslo process as we moved forward.\nI pointed out that Arafat had made no move to rein in groups like Hamas,\nand that more Israelis had actually been killed by terror since Oslo than in the\n273\nyear before. “We signed a three-phase contract with Arafat,” I said. “Try to\nimagine one of you selling me three pieces of property. If I fail to pay for the\nfirst one on time, you might not immediately cancel the contract. You might\neven be ready to help me collect the necessary money. But you would never\nproceed to deliver the second property before I paid for the first one, unless you\nwere a fool.” I also warned of longer-term dangers: “terrorism, radical Islamic\nfundamentalism, the proliferation of surface-to-surface missiles and weapons of\nmass destruction, and threats to the long-term stability of the more pragmatic\nArab regimes.” I singled out Iran, because it was determined to export its brand\nof fundamentalism Islam, sponsor terror and develop a nuclear weapon.\nI also accompanied CSIS colleagues on speaking engagements to other\nAmerican cities. I was about to board a flight to Seattle in April when I got a\nmessage saying Rabin wanted to talk to me. After we took off, I used the onboard\nphone facility and, with a swipe of a credit card, was soon on the line to\nthe Prime Minister. Since the exchange was in Hebrew, I’m fairly sure anyone\noverhearing me had no idea what we were talking about. “I need you to come\nback as soon as possible,” Rabin said. I already knew, from Giora, that he was\nanxious to find a long-term replacement as Minister of Interior. The leading\nlight in the Sephardi religious party Shas, Arye Deri, had had to leave the post\nunder allegations of bribe-taking. After Rabin had taken on the portfolio himself\nfour 18 months, he had placed Labor’s Uzi Baram there, but only as a\ntemporary arrangement. I didn’t feel I could refuse outright. But I reminded him\nthat under army rules, “as soon as possible” still meant another 100 days. And\nideally, I said I wanted to finish the best part of a year in Washington. I asked\nwhether it would be possible to join the cabinet in the middle of November\ninstead. “What difference will a few more months make?”\nRabin said he needed me now, and that mid-November would be too late.\n“Ehud, in politics, you can never predict what will happen by then.” Neither of\nus could have known how terribly prophetic his words would turn out to be.\n* * *\nI was not only new to cabinet politics. I wasn’t even a member of the\nKnesset. But in addition to naming me as head of a major ministry – in charge\nof everything from citizenship and immigration to planning, zoning, and the\nfunding of local government – Rabin made me a member of his “inner cabinet”\n274\non security and foreign affairs. Barely three weeks after I joined the\ngovernment, we had to decide on the most important agreement with the\nPalestinians since Oslo. Dubbed Oslo II, it involved a major transfer of\nauthority and territory. The process would begin with our pulling out from more\nthan a quarter of the West Bank, including the major Palestinian towns and\nsome 450 smaller towns and villages. After that, there would be three further\nredeployment phases, at six-month intervals, in so-called “Area C” of the West\nBank – a mix of unpopulated land, settlements and a number of points we’d\ndesignated as strategically important. Under Oslo, and its parent agreement\nCamp David, it was all part of ensuring the Palestinians could exercise their\n“legitimate rights” in the “single territorial entity” of the West Bank and Gaza –\nin other words, a path to statehood. But only by the time the final three phases\nof redeployment were complete were we required to begin the “permanentstatus”\ntalks on issues like land and borders, Israeli settlements, the future of\nJerusalem: the real core of a peace agreement.\nBy the time I joined the discussions on Oslo II in August 1995, the main\npoints had already been agreed. Rabin was in favor, as were virtually all the\ncabinet ministers. Whatever scant influence I might exercise would have to\ncome at the decisive cabinet meeting, set for August 13. From the objections I’d\nraised to the Gaza-Jericho deal as chief of staff, Rabin knew I’d be concerned\nnot only to ensure the security provisions avoided potential misunderstandings\non the ground, but about the longer-term implications, especially since the scale\nof the Israeli withdrawals was much larger this time. In fact, the agreement\ncould be interpreted as requiring us to cede Palestinian control over virtually all\nof Gaza and West Bank by the end of the third redeployment phase –quite\npossibly before talks on the permanent-status questions had even begun.\nI went to see Rabin a few days before the cabinet vote. I explained why I\nthought the agreement was flawed. I argued we should either delay some of our\nredeployments or bring the permanent-status negotiations forward. He listened\nto me. He barely spoke. He knew I’d be against Oslo II, and knew the reasons\nwhy. But we both knew something else: having been brought into government\nby Rabin, I would be expected, on a vote of this importance, to be in his corner.\nThe cabinet vote wasn’t happening in a political vacuum. Likud’s defeat in\n1992 had meant the end of Yitzhak Shamir’s leadership. The new Likud leader\nwas the former Sayeret Matkal officer with whom I’d shared a newspaper cover\nin 1986 predicting that he and I would end up facing each other at the ballot\nbox: Bibi Netanyahu. Positioning himself as the fresh young face of Israeli\n275\npolitics and vowing to defeat Labor, Bibi had seized on Oslo II to accuse Rabin\nof “surrendering” to Arafat, and by extension to Hamas terrorism.\nI couldn’t sleep the night before the cabinet meeting. I had no desire to be\ndisloyal to Yitzhak. I certainly didn’t want to add to the pressures on him, much\nless add further impetus to Bibi’s rhetorical onslaughts. But the more I thought\nof it, the less I could see the point of entering politics if I wasn’t going to vote\nwith my conscience. The cabinet meeting lasted for hours. It was near the end\nthat I spoke, calmly and in detail, about my reservations. Many of the ministers\nseemed barely to be listening. They’d long since made up their minds. But when\nI’d finished, two ministers passed me notes. Both said the same thing: Ehud,\ndon’t do anything crazy. Don’t vote against it. So I didn’t. But I couldn’t vote\nfor it either. I abstained.\nRabin was bitterly upset. He didn’t tell me directly. But when the meeting\nbroke up, his longtime political aide, Eitan Haber, took me aside to tell me how\nthat what I’d done was “terrible”. Giora Einy came to see me the next day, after\nRabin had phoned him in a mix of anger and disbelief. “What is this,” he’d\nasked Giora. “The first big vote, and Barak abstains?” It wasn’t until a few\nweeks later that Rabin and I spoke alone, over a beer in his office. He didn’t\nraise the question of the vote. So I did. “Yitzhak, I understand it’s caused you\npain,” I said. “But I think you understand I was acting out of what is genuinely\nmy belief and my position.” I asked him why, unlike the other ministers, he\nhadn’t passed me a note before we’d cast our votes. “Ehud,” he said, “I never\nwrite requests or orders on how to vote. Ministers must vote according to their\nconscience.” He didn’t mean what I’d done was right. He meant my conscience\nshould have told me, given the importance of the issue, to vote yes.\nThe tension between us did ease somewhat in the weeks ahead. But the\ntension around us escalated after the cabinet vote. Opinion polls showed the\ncountry split down the middle. Settlement leaders and extremist rabbis launched\na campaign against the legitimacy of the government, and of Rabin as Prime\nMinister. Right-wing religious leaders issued a decree rejecting the planned\nredeployments on the West Bank – “the evacuation of bases and their transfer to\nthe Gentiles” – as biblically prohibited. A new group called Zu Artzenu\norganized a campaign of civil disobedience to try to bring the government\ndown.\nThe sheer venom hit home during a pair of events I attended with Rabin, to\naward of the status of “city” to towns which had crossed the required threshold\nin population and economic activity. By tradition, this was marked by a\n276\nceremony with both the Interior Minister and the Prime Minister present. The\nfirst was in Ofakim, near where I’d worked in the fields with Yigal Garber in\nthe 1950s. Shortly after we arrived, a group of protestors started shouting at\nRabin. Manyac, they yelled, “maniac”. Boged: traitor. At the second event, near\nHaifa, busloads of protestors from right-wing religious schools shouted abuse at\nRabin when he rose to speak.\nAs the Knesset vote on Oslo II approached, the hatred reached new levels.\nThe day before, thousands of protesters packed into Jerusalem’s Zion Square.\nSome shouted “Death to Rabin!” Others burned pictures of him, or passed out\nphotos of him dressed in an Arab keffiyeh, or even a Nazi uniform. Bibi had\npublicly declared that opposition to the agreement must remain within the\nbounds of the law. Yet as he addressed the baying mob from a hotel balcony, he\nuttered not a single word of reproach. In fact, he called Rabin’s government\n“illegitimate”, because it relied in part on the votes of Israeli Arab Knesset\nmembers.\nThe day of the vote, the mob descended on the Knesset. Rabin had called a\ngovernment meeting beforehand. When I got there, the crowd was so large that\nI was taken in through a special security entrance away from the front of the\nbuilding. But the Housing Minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, arrived late and\ntried to drive through the main gate. Protestors pounded furiously on his car and\ntried to break the windows. Our meeting had already begun when he arrived. He\nhad spent nearly as long as I had in the army, but he was shaken. Interrupting\nRabin, he banged his fist on the table. “I’ve been on battlefields,” he said. “I’ve\nbeen shot at. I know how to read a situation. I saw their faces. It’s insane! It is\nbeyond anything rational, this kind of hatred.” Pounding the table again, he\nshouted: “I warn you. It will end with a murder! It will end with a murder!”\nRabin motioned for calm. He, too, was concerned by the rhetorical violence,\neven more so now that it was becoming physical violence. But as he would tell\nan interviewer a few weeks later, he simply didn’t believe that “a Jew will kill a\nJew.” Nor, at that point, did I.\nAfter the Knesset vote, which passed by a margin of 61 to 59, plans got\nunderway for a rally in defense of the peace process, and against the tide of\nhatred on the right. It was the idea of two people: Shlomo Lahat, a Likud mayor\nof Tel Aviv who now backed Oslo, and a French Jewish businessman named\nJean Frydman, a friend of Shimon Peres whom I had got to know and like. But\nin several of the early planning discussions in which I was involved, Rabin was\nagainst the rally, which was to be held in the huge Kings of Israel Square in the\n277\nheart of Tel Aviv. He was worried that not enough people would show up, and\nthat those who did would be from the left: Meretz, not Labor, people who would\nbe there mainly to criticize him for not going far, or quickly, enough in pulling\nout of the West Bank.\nIn the end, he was persuaded it should go ahead. In fact, by the time the date\napproached – Saturday evening, November 4 – he seemed to be feeling more\nenergized, and upbeat. I wouldn’t be there, because I was going to New York as\nthe government’s representative at a fundraising dinner that same night for the\nYad Vashem Holocaust memorial. A few hours before leaving, however, I met\nwith Rabin. We’d found a 15-minute window in his schedule, but we ended up\ntalking for an hour. He said he knew that, in some ways, the difficulties\nsurrounding the peace talks were likely to get worse. Hamas would not abandon\nterror. The kind of intolerance we were seeing from the right wing was not\ngoing to go away. He was furious at Bibi, who in his view was hypocritically\ngoing through the motions of calling for restraint and pretending to be unaware\nthat the mobs were full of Likud voters. “They’re his people,” he said, “and he\nknows it.”\nBut he was relishing the idea of taking on Bibi in the next election, due in\nabout a year’s time. Though Rabin was trailing in the polls, he was confident of\nturning that around once the campaign began. “The main thing is that the party\nisn’t focused. We have to get serious about preparing,” he said. He was worried\nabout the effect of inevitable tensions between his supporters and Peres’s over\nhow to run the campaign. “Bring back Haim Ramon,” I suggested. I knew by\nnow that Haim had helped orchestrate the false story which Yediot had run\nabout Tze’elim. But I also realized he was a Labor heavyweight and that,\nalthough he’d left the government, he remained personally close to Yitzhak.\n“Yes,” Yitzhak replied, nodding, suggesting that we talk through the idea in\ndetail when I returned from New York.\nI was in my room at the Regency Hotel, on New York’s Upper East Side,\nwhen the phone rang on Saturday afternoon. I was dimly aware that the Tel\nAviv rally had been going on back home, but was more focused on preparing\nmy speech for the Yad Vashem event. “Ehud, Ehud!” It was Nava, her voice\nbarely understandable through the sobs. “Rabin has been shot!”\n* * *\n278\nDanny Yatom called me a couple of minutes later. He said Rabin was still\nalive. But from the details he gave me, I knew it would take a miracle for him to\npull through. “Three shots, from close range,” Danny said. “From an Israeli, a\nJew.” Like Rabin, like me too until this had actually happened, it was something\nDanny was struggling to believe. He said that he’d call me back when he knew\nanything more. But I had the TV on in the room. Before he did, I watched Eitan\nHaber announce that Yitzhak Rabin was dead.\nAlthough I hadn’t known it until I’d arrived, Yossi Beilin was also in New\nYork, for meetings and a speech of his own. Though he was a Peres protégé,\nand I was seen as closer to Rabin, the two of us had become friends. We\nimmediately made plans to get the next flight home. But before leaving for the\nairport, I phoned Leah Rabin. However inadequate I knew it would be in\nhelping her even begin to cope with the loss, I told her that my, and Nava’s,\nthoughts were with her. That Yitzhak’s death would leave a tremendous hole, in\nall of us, in every single Israeli. “They shot him,” she kept murmuring. “They\nshot him. They shot him. They shot him.” I called Peres, too. “Shimon, you\nhave a mountain on your shoulders,” I said. “But your task is to carry on. All of\nus will be with you, supporting, helping however we can.”\nIt was the saddest flight I’d ever taken. Yossi and I barely spoke. Each of us\nwas deep in thought. I found myself lost in memories of Rabin – from the very\nfirst time I’d met him, in the sayeret, to that last, long talk we’d had in his office\na couple of days earlier. For some reason, I kept wondering whether, when the\nshots had been fired, he’d been turning to look behind him. It was an\nidiosyncrasy he had, whenever he was leaving a meeting or an event – even, as I\nnow recalled vividly, when the two of us were leaving the municipal ceremony\nin Ofakim. I was behind him as we left. “Ehud,” he said, turning back, “are you\nthere?” It was a senseless detail. It wouldn’t change anything. But I still felt torn\nup inside thinking about it.\nAfter we landed at Ben-Gurion, I went with Nava to the Rabins’ apartment\nin Ramat Aviv. There were hundreds of people outside, and nearly a hundred\ncrowded inside the flat. Leah looked exhausted, her face ashen. “They shot\nhim,” she said over and over as Nava and I hugged her. “Three shots. In the\nback. Why?” I said there was no sane answer, but that with Yitzhak’s death,\nIsrael seemed different, the world seemed different, and emptier. Before we left,\nwe added our candles to the forest of flickering memorial lights outside the\napartment block. Then, we drove the Kings of Israel Square. Thousands of\npeople were huddled in small groups throughout the plaza, sitting around\n279\nthickets of candles and chanting, almost prayerlike, anthems of mourning and of\npeace.\nFor reasons I couldn’t explain, I felt the need to see the place, near the front\nof the square, where Rabin had been murdered, by a 25-year-old Orthodox Jew\nand settlement activist named Yigal Amir. Standing there with Nava, I felt even\nmore strongly what I’d told Leah by phone from New York after hearing\nYitzhak was dead: his murder would leave a huge hole – in me, in all Israelis.\nHe was an extraordinary mix of qualities: a brave officer, first in the pre-state\nPalmach and then the new Israeli army; a chief of staff and defense minister at\ncritical periods in our history. Shy, even at times uncertain or hesitant, and\nnaturally cautious. Decisive, too, when he felt that he, and Israel, needed to be:\nwhether on Entebbe, or the prospect, with all its risks, of launching an operation\nto kill Saddam Hussein. Humane, too: ready to negotiate with terrorists to save\nthe lives of those they were planning to kill, unless he was confident our\nsoldiers could save them first. Underpinning it all was a dedication to fighting\nand defeating Isael’s enemies, yet a mindfulness that the real victory, if and\nwhen it was possible, would be genuine peace with our neighbors. He and I had\nhad differences over particular policies: leaving our troops in Lebanon, for\ninstance, or more recently the architecture of Oslo. But I never doubted that we\nwere lucky to have Yitzhak leading Israel on the inevitably fraught road to a\nnegotiated peace. I never ceased to believe there was no politician more suited\nto the role: that he would do everything he could to achieve it, yet would step\nback if he saw that he was putting Israel’s security at risk.\nOn Sunday evening, Peres called a cabinet meeting in the kirya. He said our\ntask was to continue what Rabin had begun, and that at least for now he would\nfill Rabin’s shoes not just as Prime Minister but Defense Minister as well. The\nwhole country stood still, shocked, until the state funeral two days after the\nassassination. It was attended by dozens of leaders from around the world. My\nrole was to escort King Hussein and Queen Noor. On our drive into Jerusalem,\nwe passed the Old City walls. We were barely a mile from the stone terrace,\nabove the Western Wall of our ancient temple, where the golden Dome of the\nRock and the Al-Aqsa mosque stand. I knew Hussein had been there as a boy\nwhen his grandfather, King Abdullah, was shot and killed by a Palestinian amid\nrumors he was contemplating peace with Israel. Now, Rabin had been\nmurdered, by an Israeli. “To me, it’s like the closing of a circle,” Hussein said.\n“Those who are murdered because they are not extreme enough. Because they\nlook for normalcy, and peace.”\n280\nYitzhak’s murder had acted like a kind lightning strike, freezing Israelis in a\nmix of disgust over what had occurred and awareness of the dangers this brand\nof hatred and extremism posed. I was concerned the moment would be allowed\nto pass. My hope was that we could seize the opportunity to bring together all\nthose Israelis – on left and right, secular and Orthodox, Ashkenazi and Sephardi\n– who were prepared to stand up against the fanaticism, the violent messianism,\nof which Yigal Amir was just a part. That was the main reason I wanted Peres\nto call an early election, an issue that would be discussed, off and on, over the\nnext few months. I felt the time was right to present the country with a choice:\nnot just between those for and against specific compromises being contemplated\nin pursuit of peace, but between those who wanted a tolerant, functioning\ndemocracy and those who were ready to use demagoguery and violence to get\ntheir way.\nPeres’s first order of business was to put in place a new cabinet. He did,\nbriefly, consider giving up the Defense Ministry and putting me there. But\ninstead, he made me Foreign Minister. Like Rabin before him, Shimon\nstipulated that he, as Prime Minister, would retain authority over the peace\nnegotiations. Still, with his agreement, I was involved in all the discussions\naround the peace talks, and in meeting many of the Arab leaders we’d have to\nnegotiate with if we were to find a lasting resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nJust a few weeks after the assassination, I represented Israel at a Euro-\nMediterranean Partnership conference in Barcelona. Its only real diplomatic\nwork consisted of ironing out the wording of the communique. The real value\nwas in the corridors, and at the dinner held at one of King Juan Carlos’s palatial\nestates, and, for me, a first opportunity to meet not only Arab foreign ministers\nbut Yasir Arafat.\nMy first, brief encounter with Arafat began a bit embarrassingly. I’d arrived\na few minutes early for the conference dinner and was led into an impressive\nhall that was almost empty except for a wonderfully cared-for royal Steinway. I\nsat down to play. Lost in the beauty of a Chopin sonata, I was completely\nunaware of PLO leader’s approach behind me. A bit awkwardly, I rose to greet\nhim. I grasped his hand. “It’s a real pleasure to meet you,” I said. “I must say I\nhave spent many years watching you – by other means.” He smiled. Our hosts\nhad set aside time after dinner for the two of us to talk at greater length, with no\naides present. But my hope was to begin by establishing simple, human contact;\nto signal respect; to begin to create the conditions not to try to kill Arafat but, if\nhe shared the same goal, to make peace with him. “We carry a great\n281\nresponsibility,” I said. “Both of our peoples have paid a heavy price. The time\nhas come to find a way to solve this.”\nIn the half hour we spent together later, I could see that, physically, the Fatah\nleader from Karameh was not just older. He had a frailty about him. His skin\nseemed almost translucent in places. His hands shook slightly, with the early\nsigns of Parkinson’s. He spoke softly. But despite this ostensibly vulnerable\nexterior, I could see how daunting, and frustrating, he must be a negotiating\npartner. Henry Kissinger has described how Mao Tse-Tung, rather than engage\ndirectly in discussion or debate, tended to wrap his remarks in parables. Without\nstretching the parallel too far, Arafat was like that. While I tried to engage him\non how each of us might help cement the Oslo process, and ensure that the\ninterim agreement indeed led to a full peace, he responded with stories, or offtopic\nremarks, which I was left to unwrap and decipher.\nHe began our discussion by saying that now that I was Foreign Minister, he\nwas glad to meet me. He said that he’d heard “reports” from his intelligence\npeople that when I was chief-of-staff, I had organized a kind of dissident band\nof generals who were working to torpedo the Oslo agreements. He compared\nthis to the OAS, the military cabal in France that had opposed De Gaulle. I\ncould only laugh. I told him I’d actually spent two months with OAS men years\nearlier, in Mont Louis, but that Israel was different. Even at times of the\ntoughest of disagreements, we were a family. An “Israeli OAS” would never\nwork, even if I had been crazy enough to contemplate such a thing. Which, I\nhastened to add, I was not.\nThere was another idiosyncrasy I encountered in Arafat. He was constantly\nwriting notes as we spoke. I didn’t mind that. But it did strike me as slightly\ndiluting the kind of frankness and openness I would find in most of the one-onone\nmeetings I went on to have with foreign leaders as Peres’s Foreign Minister.\nMaybe he did it just as a kind of aide-memoire. But certainly in later meetings I\nhad with him, it did have the effect to making me choose my words more\ncarefully. That, I believed, reduced the prospect of exploring more creatively\nthe boundaries of each of our official positions. It also helped Arafat to argue, as\nhe did on more than one occasion, that Rabin, or Peres, or whatever Israeli\ninterlocutor he chose to name had promised him such and such. He always\nimplied this was based on his written record, though he never produced any\nevidence to that effect. He also never seemed to have recorded anything that he\nhad promised Israelis.\nI tried, with only partial success, to engage some of the other Arab foreign\n282\nministers when we’d arrived in the banqueting hall. I did have a good talk with\nEgypt’s Amr Moussa, and the foreign ministers of Morocco and Tunisia. When\nI tried to start a conversation with Syria’s Farouk al-Sharaa, however, he\npointedly, though politely, said he felt that would not be appropriate. President\nAssad had broken off talks with us earlier in the year, insisting that we first\ncommit explicitly to honor Rabin’s “pocket deposit” on the Golan Heights. Still,\nin my formal remarks at the dinner, I urged both sides to resume our effort to\nnegotiate an Israeli-Syrian agreement. Sharaa’s response was, again,\nunencouraging. But I did notice, and take heart from, the fact that it was neither\npolemic nor overtly hostile towards Israel.\nWhen I returned to Israel, I found that Peres, too, wanted to restart the\nnegotiating process with the Syrians. The effort took on fresh momentum after a\nmeeting at Peres’s home in Jerusalem in early December, ahead of his visit to\nWashington for talks with President Clinton. Itamar Rabinovich and I had each\nmet with him separately a few weeks earlier to brief him on how the talks with\nthe Syrians had gone under Rabin, and why they’d reached an impasse. We\nemphasized Assad’s insistence on a preemptive agreement on our leaving the\nGolan. Peres now came forward with a plan. It was the diplomatic equivalent of\nwhat the Americans, a few years later in the second Gulf War, would call\n“shock and awe.” This was “dazzle and befuddle.” As Peres explained it, we\nwould flood Assad with proposals: not just on land or security, but everything\nfrom water and electricity to tourism and industrial zones. Assad was in\npersonal control of the Syrian side of the talks. The mere volume, range and\ncomplexity of the simultaneous engagement Peres had in mind would, he\nhoped, dilute his focus on the Golan. “The best results are extracted from\nconfusion,” he said. Having watched President Assad operate for years, when I\nwas head of intelligence and chief of staff, I said I was skeptical. I used the\nimage of a bulldog. “It comes into your living room with one aim: to lock on to\nyour ankle. You can throw fireworks, cookies, balloons, a tasty bone. But it’s a\nbulldog. It’s still going to move another step toward your ankle.” For Assad, the\nankle was the Golan.\nI understood why Peres wanted to make a new effort to get peace with Syria.\nObviously, it was something to be desired in itself. It would transform the terms\nof our conflict with the Arabs, and maybe even bring within reach the hope of\nending it altogether. But there was a political consideration as well. For all his\nother accomplishments, Peres had a record of repeated electoral defeat as head\nof Labor. This next election would be the first held under a new set of rules.\nInstead of merely choosing lists of Knesset candidates, Israelis would cast two\n283\nvotes: one for a party list and one for a directly elected Prime Minister. This\nwould be a personal test, an opportunity for Shimon to build on the still-tenuous\nachievement of Oslo and finally secure the endorsement of the Israeli people.\nIt seemed, for a while, I might even have a role. A few days later, Peres and I\nmet again. In Israeli elections, the campaign manager is called head of hasbarah\n– media and public-information planning. He told me he still didn’t know\nexactly when he would call the election. But he asked me to take on that role.\n* * *\nBoth Peres and I proved to be right about the Syrians. The negotiations did\nresume, and two rounds of talks were held at Wye River, on Maryland’s eastern\nshore, in December 1995 and January 1996. They did focus on the whole range\nof issues in an eventual peace, just as Peres had hoped, and some progress was\nmade in identifying areas of potential agreement. But the bulldog never took its\neyes of our ankle. There was no escaping the fact that without addressing the\nquestion of our withdrawal from the Golan Heights, we weren’t going to get to\nthe next stage. So a decision had to be made.\nPeres, no less than Rabin, knew what the trade-off would be. Israel needed a\nseries of ironclad security arrangements, and a genuine peace, rather than just\nagreement to a cessation of hostilities. Syria would demand to get back all, or at\nleast virtually all, of the Golan. Peres now focused on clarifying, in his own\nmind, whether we should be willing to agree to trade the Golan for a peace\ntreaty. Our key meeting took place in early February, in the underground bunker\nin the kirya. Peres asked Amnon Lipkin, as chief of staff, and our other top\ngenerals for a presentation on their view of the security arrangements required\nwith Syria under a peace deal. They recommended that Israel insist on keeping a\nsizeable part of the Golan, as well as a range of demilitarization provisions\nwhich reached pretty much to the edge of Damascus. I’d been asked for my\nview by Rabin when I was chief-of-staff. Obviously, from a purely military\nstandpoint, the ideal situation would be to keep the whole of the Golan Heights.\nNo chief of staff was going to recommend pulling out. But I’d always added a\nrider: to withdraw as part of a peace agreement, with all its other likely benefits,\nwas not a military question. It was a decision for the government. The relevant\nquestion for a chief of staff was whether we could ensure the security of Israel if\nthe government decided on a withdrawal, to which I answered yes.\n284\nI suspect Amnon would have said much the same thing. But that wasn’t the\nquestion he’d been asked. As the proceedings wound down, Peres looked glum.\nMaybe he was anticipating the potential leaks of army concerns about a Golan\nwithdrawal if we did get closer to a deal, and the venomous political attacks he\ncould expect from the right. Bibi’s stated view on a deal with Syria at the time\nwas that we could get peace and keep the Golan. It was classic Bibi, spoken\nwith verve and conviction as if simply saying it would make it true.\nWhen the presentation was over, Peres called us into a small room in the\nbunker reserved for use by the Defense Minister. As Foreign Minister, I was the\nonly cabinet member with him – along with Uri Savir, Peres’s senior deputy for\npeace negotiations and several other Peres aides. If there had been a discussion,\nI would have told him that as long as he felt the talks were progressing, he could\nignore Amnon’s presentation. If we didn’t get a deal, it would be irrelevant. If\nwe did, the military could find ways to deal with the security issues. But he just\nlooked at us and said” “We’re going for elections.” A few days later, the date\nwas set for May 29, 1996. Yet that would turn out not to be the end of Peres’s\ndoubts or difficulties. It was only the beginning.\n285\nChapter Eighteen\nThe first attack in the wave of Hamas suicide bombings destroyed a Jerusalem\nbus at 6:42 a.m. on February 25, 1996. It left 26 people dead, and nearly 80 injured\nfrom nails and shrapnel packed into the explosive charge. The second was near\nAshkelon. The bomber, dressed in Israeli uniform, joined a group of young soldiers\nand blew himself up, killing one of them. A week later, a third suicide attack\nblasted the roof off a bus on the same Jerusalem commuter route, leaving 19 more\ndead. And on March 4, a 24-year-old Palestinian walked up to the entrance of Tel\nAviv’s busiest shopping center, on Dizengoff Street, detonated 30 pounds of\nexplosives, and killed 13 people. At the bomb scenes, bloodied survivors and\ncrowds of pedestrians surveyed a hellscape of twisted metal, shards of glass and\nmangled body parts. While most Israelis were too shaken to worry about the\nimmediate political repercussions – and Bibi was careful, at least in the immediate\naftermath, not to try to score political points –Peres’s reelection campaign seemed\nto lie in tatters almost before it had begun.\nThe attacks were not a surprise. As I’d argued to the Washington think-tank\naudience before joining the government, the peace promise of Oslo had been\nassailed from the start by a new alliance of Islamist Palestinian violence: mainly\nHamas, and Islamic Jihad on the West Bank. They saw Arafat as a traitor who had\nsold out to Israel. For them, the issue wasn’t just Israel’s capture of the West Bank\nand Gaza in the 1967 war. It was 1948: they opposed any Jewish state, anywhere in\nPalestine. In a campaign of terror that made the first weeks of the intifada seem\nalmost easy to deal with, they began sending self-styled holy warriors to murder\nIsraeli civilians, and sacrifice their own lives, in the expectation of Allah’s rewards\nin the world to come. During the two years following Oslo, they’d mounted ten\nsuicide attacks, leaving nearly 80 Israelis dead. The attacks had actually stopped\nsince the summer of 1995. But when the election date was announced – with Peres\nholding a roughly 15-per-cent lead in the polls – political commentators both in\nIsrael and abroad began speculating about a resumption of terror. For Hamas, the\nelection presented not just an opportunity to kill innocent Israelis but, by helping\ndefeat Peres and Labor, perhaps to kill Oslo as well.\nEven before the bombings, our campaign was struggling for focus, energy and\neven purpose, beyond the aim of getting more votes than Bibi Netanyahu. Despite\n286\n/ BARAK / 1\nPeres’s assurance that I’d be the campaign manager, that hadn’t happened. I wasn’t\nreally surprised by that, however. When he offered me the job, I wondered how\nhe’d managed to clear it with much more established Labor politicians. It turned\nout he hadn’t. Haim Ramon, the veteran whom I’d urged Yitzhak to bring back for\nthe election, was put in charge. Shimon did ask me to head a small advisory team\nwhich reported directly to him, but all the key decisions were taken at weekly\nstrategy sessions chaired jointly by him and Ramon. I still hoped to make the\ncampaign a referendum on Yitzhak’s murder, and on the need to recommit Israel to\ndemocracy and dialogue over vitriol and violence. But Haim began with the\nassumption that, given Peres’s lead in the polls, we should simply play it safe,\nignore the issue of the assassination, and try to ignore Bibi, too. He described it as\na soccer match. We were leading by two goals, he told our first strategy meeting.\nThe other side was never going to score unless we screwed up. “To win, we do\nwhat all good teams do. We play for time. We kick the ball around. We kick the\nball into the stands. We wait for the final whistle.” I tried, without success, to argue\nthat we were underestimating Bibi. “He may be young and inexperienced in\nnational politics. But I know him from when he was even younger. He knows how\nto analyze a task, break it down, work out a plan and execute it systematically and\ntenaciously. If we play it safe and don’t define the campaign, he’ll seize on every\nerror we make and he will define it.”\nI wanted us at least to connect with Yitzhak’s legacy. I argued to both Peres and\nRamon that we should promote Shimon as the candidate with the background,\nexperience and vision to take forward what he and Rabin had begun. I also wanted\nus to echo a core assumption in all that Yitzhak did as a military and political\nleader: that peace was achievable only if Israel and its citizens felt secure. Even\nbefore the renewed terror attacks, I argued that we had to recognize that, much as\nIsraelis yearned for peace, many were conflicted and fearful about the Oslo\nprocess. I said our central campaign message should be bitachon ve shalom.\nSecurity and peace. “In that order,” I added. “We should tell voters openly that we\nexpect groups like Hamas to try to launch attacks. But they don’t want a secure\nIsrael. They don’t want peace. Don’t play their game.”\nYet the scale and intensity of the bombings threw everything into crisis. After\nthe bomb in the Dizengoff shopping mall, Peres called an emergency cabinet\nmeeting at the kirya. He knew that we had to find a way to reassure Israelis we\nwere getting a grip on the situation. We had got a start in our regular Sunday\n287\n/ BARAK / 2\ncabinet meeting the day before, by reviving an idea I’d supported under Rabin: to\nbuild a security fence all along the edge of the West Bank, with a series of\ncontrolled crossing points for people and goods. Yitzhak had said no at the time,\nbecause he was worried it would be seen as a de facto border and undermine the\nidea of building coexistence. My view then, and even more so now, was that we\nwould never get to the point of negotiating a final peace with the Palestinians\nunless we could stop at least most of the terror attacks before they happened. Peres,\ntoo, had been worried about “undermining coexistence.” But now, he and the rest\nof the cabinet were so shaken by the carnage Hamas had left that they approved the\nidea of a security barrier.\nAt our kirya meeting, hours after the latest bomb had exploded less than a mile\naway, Peres recognized we had to go further. Under Oslo, we had begun giving the\nPalestinians control over internal security in Gaza and parts of the West Bank.\nSince the new Hamas attacks, Arafat had been saying the right things. After the\nfirst bomb in Jerusalem, he’d phoned Shimon to offer condolences, telling\nreporters afterward that this was “a terrorist operation. I condemn it completely. It\nis not only against civilians, but against the whole peace process.” Yet when it\ncame to action, we saw no sign that he was willing, ready, or perhaps able to crack\ndown on the Islamist terror attacks. So Peres now announced that, if necessary in\norder to detain known terrorists, we would for the first time send Israeli troops\nback into areas where control had been handed back. If Arafat didn’t act, we\nwould.\nOn the political front, Peres did get some good news: President Clinton, anxious\nto preserve the progress he’d worked so closely with Yitzhak to achieve, organized\nan unprecedented show of international condemnation of the terror attacks. With\nEgypt’s Hosni Mubarak, he co-chaired a “Summit of Peacemakers” in Sharm al-\nSheikh with the participation not just of an equally concerned King Hussein, and of\ncourse Arafat, but leaders of Arab states from North Africa to Saudi Arabia and the\nGulf. The only significant holdout was Syria’s Hafez al-Assad. He objected\nbecause he said the conference was too focused on Israel. As Foreign Minister, I\naccompanied Shimon to the summit. A single day’s meeting was never going to\nend terror. But it was unprecedented in the breadth of Arab engagement in an\ninitiative that, as Assad had anticipated, didn’t just condemn terror in general. It\nspecifically denounced the attacks being launched inside Israel.\n288\n/ BARAK / 3\nI’d met President Clinton briefly once before, when he received Syrian chief-ofstaff\nHikmat Shehabi and me after our Blair House talks in 1994. But the Sharm\nconference provided my first opportunity to spend time with him face-to-face.\nWhen Peres and our delegation were about to leave, a Clinton aide approached and\nsaid the President had asked whether I’d like to join him on the flight back to\nIsrael. Though as surprised as I was by the invitation, Shimon nodded at me to\nsignal it was okay, so I headed off for Air Force One. I spent most of the brief\nflight talking to the President in the office space carved into the middle of the\nplane. I would later discover that he quite often tried to engage with foreign\nleaders’ colleagues or advisers on overseas trips, and not limit himself to summit\nnegotiations. It was part of his voracious appetite for information or insights which\nhe believed were essential to get a rounded understanding of the complexities of\nthe issues he was trying to address. Still, it was an extraordinarily fascinating 20\nminutes. I got my first real look at Clinton’s natural gift for person-to-person\npolitics, as well as his mastery of both the detail and nuance of Israel’s\npredicament, and of the wider conflict in the Middle East. Looking straight at me,\nalmost never breaking eye contact, he encouraged me to feel I had something of\nvalue and importance to share with him. In fact, he created the impression that I\nwas the first sentient, intelligent human being he’d ever met. He made no grand\npolicy statements. Mostly, he asked me questions: what were the prospects of\nArafat reining in Hamas and Islamic Jihad? How were our relations going with\nKing Hussein? What was my view of the chances of concluding a peace with\nHafez al-Assad, despite his boycott of Sharm al-Sheikh? If Shimon did go on to\nwin the election, what new diplomatic opportunities could he as president, and we,\nexploit in the search for peace? And, finally, what if Bibi won? I dare say this first\nmeeting was more memorable for me than for the president. But it would turn out\nto provide a foundation for our joint efforts, in a few years’ time, to resolve the\nvery issues we’d talked about on Air Force One.\n* * *\nThough the summit restored a small opinion poll lead for Peres, that merely\nreinforced Haim Ramon’s soccer-game strategy. I was more convinced than ever it\nwas wrong. Haim still wanted to ignore Bibi, but I pointed out that for at least one\n289\n/ BARAK / 4\nreason, that was absurd. Near the end of the campaign, there was going be a headto-head\ntelevision debate. In the meantime, though Bibi might be many things, he\nwasn’t stupid. He was already telling voters that while Peres was making deals\nwith Arafat, ordinary Israelis were being left to wonder where the next terrorist\nwould strike. He would surely ramp up the accusations that Peres was “weak on\nsecurity,” especially if there was more violence. To assume that if we just sat back\nwe would win seemed to me complacent and risky. Yet when I mentioned to\nShimon that a couple of our internal polls still actually had Bibi slightly ahead, he\njust laughed. “I have good polls,” he said. “Why should I believe the bad ones?”\nThen, however, violence intervened again. It was not Hamas this time.\nBeginning on March 30 and escalating sharply 10 days later, Katyusha rockets\nrained onto towns and settlements in northern Israel by Hizbollah – the first\nsustained attack since the cease-fire in 1994. It was pretty obvious that, like\nHamas, the Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia in Lebanon was not just targeting Israeli\ncivilians, but Oslo, and Peres’s chances of winning the election. The last thing\nShimon wanted was for tens of thousands of people in the north of Israel to be\ncowering in shelters during the final stretch of the campaign. So on April 11, he\nordered a major military operation in Lebanon.\nI wasn’t party to the discussions about the operation. But the model chosen was\nsimilar to the one I’d drawn up in 1994: a large-scale air and artillery assault\ndesigned to hit Hizbollah hard, force civilians to flee and persuade the Lebanese\nand Syrian governments to commit to a US-mediated end to the rocket attacks.\nAgain, all of that happened. But not before a tragic accident which brought a storm\nof international criticism and hastened the end of the operation. An Israeli specialforces\nunit was ambushed while providing laser targeting support for an air force\nstrike. When it called in artillery support, four of the shells fell on a UN compound\nnear the Lebanese village of Qana, killing more than 100 civilians seeking shelter\ninside.\nPeres phoned me a few hours later, distraught not just because the wayward\nartillery strike had laid us open to charges of “targeting” civilians in an operation\ndesigned to try to avoid doing so. Also, because the accident seemed likely to deal\na further blow to his efforts to convince Israel’s voters that he, rather than Bibi,\nwas the man best placed to lead the country. “We’re in trouble,” he said. Yet\nwithin days, it became clear that our basic campaign strategy – ignore Bibi and\n“kick the ball into the stands” – was not going to change. I did make one last\n290\n/ BARAK / 5\nattempt to help put us on the political offensive, after I was asked to record on of\nLabor’s TV campaign messages. I knew what I wanted to say. I’d talked it over\nwith the small group of campaign experts Peres had asked me to assemble\nalongside Ramon’s main team. Rather than ignore Bibi, I was going to use my\nposition as his former commander in Sayeret Matkal, someone who knew him\nwell, to explain why Peres should lead Israel.\n“How many of us can really understand what it means to be a Prime Minister?”\nI began. “As head of intelligence, and chief of staff, I have seen, close-up, what it\ntakes to be a Prime Minister. It is not a game. We’ve had good Prime Ministers:\nBen-Gurion, Peres, Rabin, Begin... Bibi, we know each other well, from the days\nwhen you were an officer under my command. A young officer, and a good one.\nPrime Minister is the most important and serious role in this country. Bibi, it’s not\nyet you. We need an experienced leader, who will know how to guide us with\nwisdom, strength and sensitivity. Shimon Peres is that man.”\nYet we were never going to be able to avoid engaging with Bibi altogether. The\nface-to-face television debate between the two candidates was set for May 27, two\ndays before the election. By American standards, the format was fairly tame. No\ndirect exchanges were permitted, only a series of questions directed at each\ncandidate by a leading political journalist, Dan Margalit. Still, it would place\nShimon and Bibi side by side. We spent two days prepping Peres, with Avraham\nBurg – an early Peace Now supporter, former Peres aide and Knesset member –\nstanding in for Bibi. Avraham played the role well, anticipating the lines of attack\nShimon would face. But as I watched, I worried that even he couldn’t replicate one\nof Bibi’s key advantages. During his time at the embassy in Washington, and\nespecially as UN ambassador, Bibi had become a frequent presence on American\ntelevision interview shows. Always articulate, he was now also an experienced,\nand completely comfortable, television performer. In our debate rehearsals, Peres\nsounded well versed on all the issues. Yet I sensed his problem wasn’t going to be\nthe message, but the medium. He sounded a bit distant, unengaged, almost as if the\nTV debate was something he knew he had to go through, but which he thought\nslightly sullied the proper purpose of politics.\nIn the real debate, Shimon seemed to convey the sense that merely being in the\nsame studio with a pretender as raw and untested as Bibi was offensive. When each\nof the candidates was given the opportunity at the end to ask a single question of\nthe other, Peres didn’t even bother. He did come over as the man with much more\n291\n/ BARAK / 6\nexperience, gravitas, substance. He also had what was probably the best line in the\ndebate, saying that if Israeli voters were choosing a male model and not a Prime\nMinister, Bibi might indeed be their man. Yet Bibi was much the more polished\nperformer, and the more focused. No matter what question Margalit asked him, he\nalmost invariably answered with the driving message of his campaign: that because\nof Peres, Israeli citizens were living in fear, wondering where the next suicide\nbomber would strike or the next Katyusha would land. And unavoidably, there was\nanother contrast as well: Bibi, who, after all, was 26 years younger, projected\ngreater youth, energy and confidence. When it was over, and Peres asked us how\nhe’d done, we all hemmed and hawed. Only Avraham Burg was prepared to offer a\nclear verdict. He told Peres that Bibi had been the clear winner.\nStill, it remained possible that Ramon’s football-game strategy might work.\nThough Peres’s poll lead had been narrowing by the day, he was – just – ahead.\nWith a large number of voters undecided, however, Bibi pulled one final trick out\nof his campaign bag. Under Israeli law, election spending is tightly regulated and\nnearly all campaigning is barred during the last 48 hours before polling day. Yet\nwith the backing of wealthy overseas supporters, the Netanyahu campaign\nsuddenly flooded Israel with blue-and-white banners under the slogan: Bibi, Tov la\nYehudim. “Bibi is good for the Jews.” Would it swing tens of thousands of votes\namong the Orthodox voters who were the main target? It was impossible to say.\nBut it seemed clear it was going to be a very close election.\nI had worried for some time we might lose. That was why Nava and I had\npersuaded Michal, our eldest daughter, to bring forward her wedding. She was\nmarrying her teenage boyfriend, a wonderful young man named Ziv Lotenberg.\nThey had originally planned it for a week later. But we did want to risk having it\novershadowed by an election defeat. The wedding took place in a beautiful area of\nlawns and gardens called Ronit Farm, north of Herzliya. It was how weddings are\nmeant to be, full of smiles, good food and dancing. Near the end, Shimon showed\nup. As he walked over to greet us, one guest after another shook his hand, patted\nhim on the back, hugged him, wished him luck. It was as if all the pressure and\ntension of the campaign had suddenly flowed out of him. He smiled, returned the\nembraces, even joined in the dancing. When he left, I told him that he’d done all he\ncould to secure victory, and that I hoped the voters would make the right choice.\nThe first exit polls suggested he was going to win. But our internal polling was\nless clear. As more and more votes were counted, Shimon’s margin inexorably\n292\n/ BARAK / 7\nnarrowed. It wasn’t until the next morning that the final result was clear: Bibi\nNetanyahu had won. By 29,000 votes. If a mere 15,000 of the three million ballots\ncast had gone in our column instead of his, Shimon Peres would have remained\nPrime Minister.\nI knew he’d be feeling crushed. Not just on a personal level, because this latest\nelectoral defeat had been in was a direct, head-to-head vote for Prime Minister. He,\nlike all of us who had campaigned for him, knew what was at stake for the country.\nIt had been barely six months since Rabin was gunned down in Tel Aviv’s main\nsquare, by a fellow Israeli riding a tide of hatred so blinkered that it could paint\nYitzhak – who had worked all his life to create, defend and help develop the\nJewish state – as a traitor, even a Nazi. All because he had decided to try to make\npeace with the Palestinians, at the price of ceding control of part of the biblical\nland of Israel. Bibi had gone through the motions of urging restraint. But\npolitically, he had ridden their wave. It was hard not to see his victory over Peres\nas a triumph for the ugly intolerance and the venom that had claimed Yitzhak’s\nlife. In policy terms, it was in large part a rejection of both men’s vision of an\nIsrael that, while still ready to fight if necessary, could explore compromise in the\nsearch for the ultimate prize of peace. The last time Yitzhak and I had talked, he’d\nbeen confident of defeating Bibi at the polls, and I do believe he would have won.\nBut despite his differences with Peres, I’m equally certain he would have wanted\nShimon to win, not just for his sake but for Israel’s.\nI had got to know Shimon, too, during my years in the kirya. In fact, he was the\nLabor leader who first spoke to me openly about one day moving into politics,\nsomething Yitzhak was always punctilious in not broaching before I’d left the\narmy. Shimon had also taken to including me – usually along with Yossi Beilin\nand Shlomo Ben-Ami, a bright young historian who would become our\nambassador to Spain before entering politics himself – in a coterie of “youngsters”\nhe would bring along to meet visiting dignitaries from abroad. He occasionally\ninvited me to chat about military and security issues in his and Sonya’s flat in\nRamat Aviv. My personal ties to Rabin were stronger, of course. After I joined the\ngovernment, Shimon’s and my relationship became slightly more circumspect. But\nsince the assassination, some of the old warmth had returned. Not just as his\nforeign minister, but in discussions on wider questions of security as well, we\nworked closely together.\n293\n/ BARAK / 8\nWithin days of the election, however, there was a new source of potential\nfriction between us: Shimon’s future, and possibly mine, in leading our opposition\nto Bibi and bringing a Labor government back to power.\n* * *\nThe question of Peres’s leadership was unavoidable. Labor’s constitution\nmandated a vote for party chairman within 14 months of an election defeat. But the\nwidespread assumption was that Shimon would run again. A little before midnight\non election day, with the returns beginning to show we might lose, I was invited to\na morning-after breakfast by two senior Labor ministers: Fuad Ben-Eliezer, the\nman who had delivered the table-thumping warning that the hatred on the far-right\nwould lead to a murder, and Avraham Shochat, Finance Minister under both Rabin\nand Peres. Both had been in the Knesset since the 1980s. Both were part of two of\nPeres’s earlier, failed, election campaigns. Both now said that they weren’t\nprepared to see him lead us into electoral battle the next time around. “Everyone in\nthe party understands the meaning of this defeat. Shimon is done,” Shochat said, as\nFuad nodded his agreement. “You will have to go for the leadership.”\nThough their endorsement was a surprise, it would be disingenuous to pretend I\nhadn’t been thinking, at some stage in the future, of running for the party\nleadership. But my election-campaign differences with Ramon and Peres were not\njust for the sake of intellectual argument. I badly wanted us to win: both for Peres’s\nsake and the country’s, and to redeem and continue all that Yitzhak had sacrificed.\nDespite my misgivings about some aspects of the Oslo process, I did believe there\nwas a possibility of achieving peace with the Palestinians. I knew, from my\ninvolvement in the talks with the Syrians, that the outline of a possible peace\nagreement with Assad was already in place. I frankly wasn’t confident that Bibi\nwas the man to lead it forward. Yes, he was smart. He was organizationally astute.\nHe’d been a good sayeret officer. Yet as I’d said it my TV spot, being Prime\nMinister required much more than that. I was now an elected Knesset member. But\nI had gone into politics in the hope of making a difference to how Israel confronted\nits defining challenges of war and peace. The prospect of spending the next few as\na mere opposition foot soldier, making speeches and sitting in committee sessions,\n294\n/ BARAK / 9\nseemed to defeat the purpose of going into politics in the first place.\nStill, I had no appetite for rushing into a challenge to Peres’s leadership, both\nbecause it was bound to be difficult for both of us, and frankly because it seemed\nrash, premature and maybe even unnecessary. Bibi was beginning the negotiations\nto form a government, and that process was likely to take at least a few weeks.\nShimon had yet to signal whether he did intend to stay on. Still, when he invited\nme for a late-night chat at his apartment a week after the election, I was concerned\nhe might raise the leadership issue and I knew that, if he did, I would have to be\nhonest and open with him.\nThe conversation went very differently than I’d expected. After he’d poured\neach of us a glass of Armagnac, and offered me a plate of Sonia’s cakes, he spoke\nfor a while about Bibi, though he could not even bring himself to utter the name.\nThis man, he said, knew nothing about leadership, much less about running the\ncountry. He would be outmaneuvered, overshadowed and ultimately controlled by\nthe “real strongman” in the Likud: Arik Sharon. I said I thought we were again\nunderestimating Bibi’s strength, as well as the effect of the country’s new electoral\nsystem. He was the first Prime Minister to enjoy a direct, personal mandate. That\nturned upside down the balance of power and influence in our politics. As he\nassembled his coalition, the other parties, if they wanted to be in government,\nwould have to deal with him on his terms. So, to a much greater extent than before,\nwould potential internal rivals.\nAs we talked, I was struck that Shimon seemed resigned to the election defeat,\nrelaxed, more at ease with himself than at any time since the start of the grueling\ncampaign. Then, quite suddenly, he said: “Ehud, I understand the meaning of the\nelection result. “You will have to take on the leadership, and lead the party.” He\nsaid he didn’t plan to spend the rest of his years hanging around the apartment. He\nwould remain active – “working for peace” – but no longer in the party political\narena. “I understand the meaning of what has happened,” he repeated. “I will pass\nthe Labor leadership torch to you. We should find a way to do it quickly, and in the\nright way.”\nIt was nearly three in the morning when I left. I was not just surprised, but\ntouched, by what he’d said. Shimon was now nearly 73. He’d had a life in our\ncountry’s politics, and in Labor, stretching back to before the state, when he’d been\na favored protégé of Ben-Gurion. Walking away was going to be hard. I was\n295\n/ BARAK / 10\ntouched as well by the fact that he had decided to “pass the torch” to me, someone\nmore in the mold, and closer to, Rabin. But I remained cautious, too. When I got\nback home, Nava, knowing where I’d been, was still awake. I told her everything\nthat Shimon had said. I told her how extraordinary it felt to have the prospect, at\nleast, of leading Labor in opposition to Bibi, without the need to confront, or to\ninflict personal hurt, on Shimon. But I added: “It seems a bit too good to be true.”\nIt was. The next morning, I joined other ministers and party officials with Peres\nin his office. It was as if our conversation a few hours before had never happened.\nShimon set out his strategy for Labor going forward. And the first thing he said\nwas that the party needed to push back any leadership election beyond the\nmandated 14 months.“It’s too early,” he said. He said we needed to focus on two\nother strategic imperatives: to reconstruct the party, and consider the issue of\njoining a possible “unity” government with Bibi.\nThough Bibi went on to form his government without us, in alliance with a\nnumber of smaller Orthodox parties, the idea of a Labor leadership change seemed\noff the agenda, at least for now. In early August, I was standing next to Giora Einy\n– the “political operative” Yitzhak had sent to help bring me into his government,\nand a friend of Peres as well – when Shimon rose to speak to the dozens of wellwishers\nat his 73 rd -birthday celebration in Tel Aviv. He was at his old, selfconfident\nbest. With just a few thousand extra votes, we would have won the\nelection, he said. He was sure Bibi’s coalition – “a coalition against peace” –\nwould not survive for long. Giora, smiling, turned to me and said: “It doesn’t\nsound like a farewell speech. It seems like he’s ready for the next round. He lost\ntwice to Begin. He lost once to Shamir. And only once to Bibi. He’s not going to\nstop without giving it another go.”\nAnother of Peres’s old friends, a few weeks later, urged me to press him on the\nneed to step aside. I’d become closer to the French Jewish businessman Jean\nFrydman during the election campaign. Since he had helped organize the fateful\npeace rally at which Rabin was shot, he felt – wrongly, but powerfully – a sense of\nresponsibility for what had happened. He wanted to do everything possible to\nensure that Rabin’s political legacy, and Shimon’s, survived. He invited Nava and\nme to visit him for a few days. When he asked about the birthday celebration, I\ntold him what Peres had said. “He’s making a huge mistake,” Jean told me. “After\nevery election, he goes through the same process. Always, he’s convinced that next\ntime he will win.” I said how I dreaded the prospect of being part of an effort to\n296\n/ BARAK / 11\nforce Shimon out. But Jean said he’d been giving a lot of thought to everything\nthat had happened since Rabin was killed. He felt I was the only potential Labor\nleader who could defeat Bibi in an election and “bring back sanity to Israel, lead it\nto peace.” He said he was convinced that Peres’s time had passed. “I can say that.\nI’m from his generation. And as a very close friend of Shimon, I will be the first in\nline to help you.”\nEarly in September, having let Shimon know through Giora and then phoning\nhim directly, I declared publicly that I would be running for the Labor leadership.\nThough he’d thanked me for telling him beforehand, he said he thought I was\nmaking a mistake, and was still against having a leadership election at all. That\nmade his public response to my announcement puzzling. He went on Israeli TV\nand said he would not be a candidate for Prime Minister in four years’ time. “The\ntime has come for a change,” he said. But while everyone took that to mean he was\nreconciled to a change of party leadership as well, it turned out that we had jumped\nthe gun. He intended to stay on as chairman.\nDuring the early months of 1997, Shimon and I held a series of late-night\nmeetings at his apartment to thrash out an agreed course. It was a process that was\nhard for both of us, and hurtful for him. He was now at least reconciled to the\ninevitability of an election for a new party leader, if only because his protégé Yossi\nBeilin had also put his name forward. But he kept proposing to push back the vote.\nI insisted that since the deadline under party rules was June 3, it was only right that\nall of us abide by that. I do remember a particularly poignant moment from one of\nour sessions. Peres had left the room for a minute, and Sonia came in. “Ehud,” she\nsaid to me, “keep your nerve. You’re the only one who can talk to him this way.\nHe should have retired from politics years ago. You’re the only one around him\nwho tells him the truth.”\nWe ended up with a compromise. Shimon accepted that the leadership election\nwould be held on June 3. I agreed that in the unlikely event Bibi decided to invite\nus into his coalition during the three months after the leadership vote, Peres would\nselect the Labor ministers. Our last meeting ended at nearly four in the morning.\nHe told me he’d arranged a reception for the party leadership at 10 a.m., in barely\nsix hours’ time. He suggested we meet in his office an hour beforehand. I didn’t\nknow what to expect. After months of discussions, I hoped he understood that I\nhad wanted the process to go differently. I had been open and honest with him\nthroughout. But I knew that, deep down, he still wanted to stay on, that he believed\n297\n/ BARAK / 12\nthat his long record of service should have earned him that right, and that it would\nbe painful for him to accept that, by June, there would be a new Labor leader.\nHe was relaxed and gracious when I arrived. We went through the details of\nwhat we’d agreed, and worked out what each of us would say to reporters. What\ncame next, as the party faithful filed in, was simple human nature, I suppose.\nSeeing some of his oldest supporters, he had second thoughts. His comments to\nreporters afterward were more hedged than what we’d discussed. Giora told me\nthat after all of us had left, Peres turned to him and said: “Look what Barak is\ndoing to me. What have you been doing?” Giora, who had been a conduit between\nus at the very beginning of our discussions, replied: “You asked me to bring Barak\nto you.” At which point, Shimon said: “OK. So probably I made a mistake.”\nAt a convention of 3,000 party activists in mid-May, a few weeks before the\nleadership election, he made a final attempt to mitigate that “mistake”. Nissim\nZvili, the secretary-general of the party and a longtime Peres ally, introduced a\nmotion to vote him into a new post of party president. A couple of Shimon’s\nfriends urged me to back the idea, describing it essentially as a ceremonial role.\nBut I feared it was a recipe for prolonging the agony. Whatever powers “President\nPeres” would have, the idea of two captains on a ship would almost certainly mean\ntrouble. I was especially reluctant to go along with it because our particular ship\nhad been in rough waters for so long. Labor needed to steer a calm, decisive course\ntoward the next election if we were going to defeat Bibi.\nWhat followed was one of the most painful spectacles I’ve ever witnessed.\nWhen Peres rose to make his case for becoming party president, he said: “I don’t\nwant powers. I don’t want honors. But I also don’t want insults. I announced my\ndecision to resign from the position of party chairman. Did someone push me into\nit? Am I trying to hold on to my job?”\n“Yes!” many hundreds of the delegates shouted back at him.\nStung, he reminded the meeting that it was he who had led Labor back from the\nbattering it took in the 1977 election against Begin. In 1981, he’d helped us\nrecover a dozen of our lost seats. Even so, because he hadn’t succeeded in forming\na Labor government, people had called him a loser! “Mah? Ani loser?” he asked,\nusing the English word. “Am I a loser?”\n“Yes! Yes!” came the shouts.\n298\n/ BARAK / 13\nYet the saddest note came at the end. “I apologize for being healthy, for not\ngetting old according to plan,” he said, adding that even without the title of\npresident, he would keep working for peace.\nThere were three other candidates for party chairman: Yossi Beilin; Ephraim\nSneh, the friend who’d been the paratroopers’ chief medic when we’d fought at the\nChinese Farm in 1973, and at Entebbe too; and Shlomo Ben-Ami, the academic\nand diplomat whom Shimon had taken along with Yossi and me to meet visiting\nforeign politicians, and who was now also a newly elected member of the Knesset.\nWhen the vote came, it was assumed by most political commentators that I was\ngoing to win. The only question was whether I’d get the 50 per cent of votes\nneeded to avoid a run-off, where the outcome might be less predictable. But I got\n57 percent against Yossi’s 28, with the remaining 15 percent split between\nEphraim and Shlomo-Ben Ami.\n* * *\nNow, we had to put ourselves in a position to defeat Bibi and the Likud. Policy\npriorities were ultimately what would matter most: strong and credible steps to\nconfront terror and safeguard our security, allied with the leadership and will to try\nto negotiate a peace with Syria and the Palestinians; and, at home, a recommitment\nto the values of an open, tolerant democracy. But in at least one important way, I\napproached my new role as if it was one of our operations in Sayeret Matkal, or the\nneed to reshape our armed forces when I was chief-of-staff. My first priority was to\nput in place the practical foundations for a successful election challenge against\nBibi. Through Jean Frydman and other business supporters with the means and the\ndesire to help, my brother-in-law, Doron Cohen, assembled sufficient funding for\nus to begin engaging with the strategists who had helped deliver electoral success\nfor a trio of other centre-left political leaders overseas: Bill Clinton, Tony Blair in\nBritain and later Gerhard Schroeder in Germany.\nMy main early political focus was on holding Bibi and the government to\naccount in the Knesset, above all on the torturous process of ensuring our security\nwhile implementing the West Bank redeployments agreed in Oslo II. We’d made a\nsmall start under Rabin and Peres, but the three major withdrawal phases due in the\n299\n/ BARAK / 14\nfive-year interim period had yet to begin. In one respect, I had some sympathy for\nBibi’s predicament. The reason I’d tried to get Yitzhak to alter the terms of Oslo II\nwas that it required us to hand back control before we knew what a “permanentstatus”\npeace deal would look like. But where my sympathy ended was in how Bibi\nhandled the situation. Despite my concerns about the way the Oslo process had\nbeen designed, I never doubted that killing it off would be by far a worse\nalternative. Bibi had been elected to lead Israel. Instead, he acted as if he was\nplaying some sort of pinball match, flipping the ball first one way, then the other,\nwith no obvious aim beyond keeping it in play – and, where Oslo was concerned,\nsimply stalling for time. Rather than setting out any vision of where he hoped to\nmove the negotiating process, he seemed more concerned with keeping the rightwing\nof Likud and the smaller, even more extreme parties from turning against\nhim.\nIn late September 1996, Bibi and the Likud mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert,\ndecided to go ahead with the festive opening of an archeological tunnel that\nprovided access to a larger portion of the Western Wall of the ancient Jewish\ntemple. It was a decision that, under both Rabin and Peres, we’d delayed out of\nconcern about inflaming tensions with the Palestinians. As Shimon rightly said\npublicly after the three days of violence that followed, we understood that, at a\nminimum, it would need to be coordinated beforehand with Arafat. As the unrest\nspread into the West Bank and Gaza, there were media warnings of a “new\nintifada,” the difference this time being that the Palestinians newly established\npolice had entered the fray. By the time urgent US diplomacy, our efforts and\nArafat’s, brought it to a close, 25 Israeli soldiers and nearly 100 Palestinians had\nbeen killed. He did not slam the brakes altogether on the American-led efforts to\nmove ahead with the Oslo. In early 1997, in fact, he and Arafat reached a separate\nagreement on the critically important question, and potential flashpoint, of Hebron.\nIt stipulated that about 80 percent of the area would be under Palestinian authority,\nwith Israel retaining control and responsibility for nearby settlements and key\nsecurity points. Despite right-wing and settler opposition, it was approved by a\nwide margin in the Knesset, with Labor’s backing. But a few months later, in the\nspring of 1997, Hamas launched a new campaign of suicide bombings in shopping\nareas of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, leaving 24 people dead. While not suggesting that\nBibi took the human cost of terror lightly, he did use the attacks to drag out further\nUS-mediated talks on the details of implementing the Oslo II redeployments.\n300\n/ BARAK / 15\nBy November, even his Foreign Minister, David Levy, was making noises\nabout quitting. He said it would be a waste of time to stay in the cabinet if it was\ngoing to bring the peace process to a halt. I warned Bibi, both in the Knesset and in\na series of speeches, about the alternative on the Palestinian side if those who\nwanted a negotiated peace had nothing but stalemate to show for it. And lives, I\ninsisted, were at stake. Both through closed-door sessions of the Knesset’s security\nand foreign affairs committee, and my own contacts in military intelligence, I was\nconvinced that the result would be a second, much more deadly, intifada. Not with\nMolotov cocktails, but guns, and suicide bombs.\nI was not out to score political points in keeping the pressure on Bibi to move\nforward. In fact, I announced that if Bibi did go ahead and finalize the terms for\nour Oslo redeployment, Labor would once again provide the extra Knesset votes\nneeded for him to get it approved.\nEarly in 1998, he sent word that he wanted to talk. The message came through\nYaakov Ne’eman, his Finance Minister and a prominent lawyer whom I knew and\nliked. He and I held an exploratory meeting at which he proposed talks with Bibi\non the prospect of a unity government that would help move the peace process\nforward. I said I’d talk, with one proviso: the discussions would be genuinely\nsecret, with no leaks. I was not prepared to engage in political gamesmanship. In\nMay, Bibi sent an assurance of confidentiality through Ne’eman. The first of about\na half-dozen meetings came a few days later at the Prime Minister’s residence in\nJerusalem. Then, we shifted venue, meeting at a Mossad-owned villa north of Tel\nAviv. I brought along Bougie Herzog, a bright young lawyer, and Labor Party\nmember, who was working in the same law firm and Ne’eman. It was by no means\nclear we’d agree on a unity government. To my amusement, if not altogether to my\nsurprise, I got word that Bibi was putting out separate political feelers to Shimon\nPeres. But before long, it became clear there was a specific political motivation\nbehind his approaching me. It was indeed the peace process. But it wasn’t the\nPalestinian peace process, something Bibi still clearly wanted to avoid as much as\nhumanly possible. It was an attempt to engage with Syria.\nHe asked me about the talks under Rabin and Peres, and my views on the\npossibility of a deal with President Assad. He also wanted my assessment about\nwhether the army could work out arrangements to safeguard the country’s security\nif we handed back most, if not all, of the Golan Heights. If so, what kind of\nsecurity arrangements, with what timeline? We met through the summer, as the\n301\n/ BARAK / 16\ntalks with the Americans on the further West Bank redeployments meandered\nahead. We also discussed in detail how a unity government would work. We\nagreed it would be presented, like the Shamir-Peres partnership in 1984, as a crossparty\nresponse to an important challenge for the country: in this case, security and\nthe peace process. I would be both Defense Minister and “Vice-Prime Minister”,\nwith the understanding that Bibi and I would jointly discuss all major issues before\njointly agreeing to bring them to the full cabinet.\nBut in August, the talks ended, after news of our talks finally leaked. I\nimmediately phoned Ne’eman. I reminded him that at the outset, I’d said that\nwould mean the discussions were over. He did call me back later in the day to say\nBibi insisted that he’d had nothing to do with the leak. My guess was that the\nsource was my old comrade from the Chinese Farm, Yitzhik Mordechai, who had\npresumably heard that Bibi was ready to make me Defense Minister as part of a\nunity government. There was, of course, already a defense minister: Yitzhik.\nBibi’s idea to reopen efforts to get peace with Syria didn’t last either. Although\nI’d learn of this only a few years later, he’d approved a visit to Damascus by the\nAmerican Jewish businessman Ronald Lauder to meet President Assad. The visit\nmade it clear to Bibi what successive Israeli leaders had learned: a deal might be\npossible, but only if Israel was willing to commit in advance to pulling out of the\nGolan. Assad told Lauder to come back to him with a detailed map setting out\nBibi’s view on delineating the Israeli-Syrian border under a peace agreement.\nThough no one in the cabinet knew the initiative was underway, Bibi realized that\nbefore sending back the map Assad wanted, he would need to tell the two senior\nministers directly affected: Arik Sharon, who had replaced David Levy as Foreign\nMinister; and Yitzhik Mordechai. Both of them said no, with Yitzhik pointing out\nthat a signed map would inevitably become part of the negotiating record. It was a\nstep that, in future negotiations, could not be undone.\nBibi’s coalition was now creaking. The Syrian option was off. David Levy had\nalready jumped ship. Yitzhik, increasingly concerned about Bibi’s delay and drift\non Oslo II, seemed to be thinking of leaving as well. Right wing ministers and\nKnesset members were no happier: they opposed even the slightest prospect of\nmovement on Oslo. In October, Bibi did finally try to seize the initiative. He\nwrapping up the redeployment details in a summit with Arafat and Clinton and\nArafat in Wye River. But as soon as he got back home, he started backtracking,\nrather than risk facing down his right-wing critics in the cabinet. Implementation of\n302\n/ BARAK / 17\nthe deal was due to begin in early November, but he kept putting off a vote in the\ncabinet. When the vote came, on November 11, Bibi squeaked through by a margin\nof 8 to 4, but with five abstentions. That meant less than half of his ministers had\nvoted for it.\nThe easy part for him was Knesset ratification, since I had committed Labor to\nsupporting Bibi on any move towards continuing the peace process. The day after\nthe Knesset’s vote, Bibi won the cabinet’s clearance for actual implementation to\nbegin. But it didn’t. With hard-line ministers threatening to bring down the\ngovernment if it did, Bibi again stalled. That was the turning point. I’d made it\nclear our parliamentary support would remain for as long as Bibi moved ahead\nwith what had been agreed at Wye River. It was not intended as a blank check, or\nan offer to prop up a Prime Minister who now seemed to be looking for any way\npossible not to implement the agreement.\nMy key ally in what came next was Haim Ramon. Despite our differences over\nthe direction of the Peres election campaign, we had become effective\nparliamentary partners. He had a depth of political experience and knowledge I still\nlacked. While I found the details of how the Knesset operated arcane and often\ntiresome, Haim knew all of it instinctively. When it came to the need for discreet\ndiscussions or bargaining with other parties, not only could he draw on his\npersonal relationships with Knesset members across the party divide. He had the\nadditional advantage of being able to avoid the scrutiny that would follow a direct\napproach from me. Before Bibi had gone to Wye, Haim and I had discussed how\nwe might move to force early elections. The peace process, and the country, were\ndrifting. There seemed no point in waiting, if we could be confident of lining up\nthe necessary votes among the growing number of others who were also convinced\nBibi should go. After the Wye summit agreement, I put all that on hold. But now\nthat Bibi had shifted into reverse, I told Haim to resume his efforts.\nIn early December, he told me he had enough votes for a no-confidence motion,\nunder his name, to dissolve the Knesset and pave the way for early elections. The\naxe fell on December 20. Bibi had lost the support of the right-wing, who wanted\nOslo ended altogether. He had now lost me, too. I felt his approach to the peace\nprocess was leaving Israel rudderless. The way we were heading, we would not\njust forfeit any potential benefits from Oslo. We would be leaving a political and\ndiplomatic vacuum at a time when a serious new explosion of Palestinian violence\nwas becoming ever more likely. In the Knesset debate, Bibi made one final bid to\n303\n/ BARAK / 18\nsave himself: by suggesting a delay of 72 hours for talks on a “unity” government.\nI said that I was all for unity. But I reminded him that, time after time, we’d saved\nhis government in order to continue the peace process. We could no longer help\nout a “government that is not interested in upholding the Wye agreement, but only\nin its political survival.”\nThe vote of no-confidence went against him by the yawning margin of 81 to 30,\nwith nine Knesset members abstaining or staying away. A few days later, the date\nfor the election was announced: May 17, 1999.\n304\n/ BARAK / 19\nChapter Nineteen\nA few hours before Haim Ramon introduced his no-confidence resolution, he\ncame to see me in my office in the Knesset. He was worried. Not about the vote,\nbut about what would come after. “Ehud, I’m sure we can topple the government,”\nhe told me. “But only you know whether we’re ready – whether you’re ready – to\ndefeat Bibi in an election.”\n“I’m ready,” I said. “We are going to win.”\nFew agreed. In fact, there had been times during my first year-and-a-half as\nLabor leader when I wondered if I’d be able to hang on to the job. I was in charge\nof a party whose grassroots were on the left. I was, by intellect and instinct, a\npragmatist and a centrist. I did share Labor’s vision of a socially just and\ndemocratic Israel. Especially after seeing far-right rabbis egg on the fanaticism that\nultimately killed Yitzhak Rabin, I felt strongly that we needed to separate\norganized religion from our day-to-day politics. But I’d been raised with a deeper\nrespect for our Jewish traditions than many on the left. Right after Yitzhak’s\nmurder, I’d gone to see Zevulun Hammer, the leader of the National Religious\nParty. It had been part of both Labor and Likud governments ever since 1948,\nthough not Rabin’s. The NRP, too, had been drifting steadily rightward. But it still\nbasically subscribed the idea of a strong, democratic Israel under the rule of law. I\nwanted to bring the NRP back into the government under Peres, as part of the\nwidest possible political alliance against the assassination and the campaign of\nhatred that had fostered it. Sadly that didn’t happen, in part because of the anger\nagainst all Orthodox politicians after Rabin’s murder. Yet in my readiness to\nengage politically with Orthodox leaders who did not reject the very idea of peace\nnegotiations – whether in the NRP, or the increasingly influential Sephardi\nreligious party, Shas – I was outside Labor’s mainstream, and its comfort zone.\nOn my approach to peace as well, I differed from many on the left. Though I\nwas determined to pursue any realistic avenue to negotiations, I was convinced that\nsecurity considerations had to be paramount in what we were prepared to give up\nor accept in negotiations. I was cautious about ceding too much too soon, in case\nthe Palestinians or the Syrians proved either unequal to, or uninterested in, making\nthe hard decisions required for peace. That was an approach with, like Yitzhak\n305\n/ BARAK / 20\nbefore me, provoked more left-wing parties like Meretz to suggest that if I really\nwanted peace, I’d be ready to give away more, and more quickly.\nMy position wasn’t helped by the way I had come over in the media during my\nfirst months as Labor leader. A number of newspaper commentators wrote that\nwhile they found talking with me stimulating, I seemed to be operating in a world\nof my own, either unable or unwilling to give straight answers and a single, clear\nmessage. They were right about that. If asked a question, especially one which\nobviously involved an issus of nuance, my instinct was not to come up with a\nsound bite. It was, as best I could, to answer fully and accurately. The difficulties\nthat could sometime cause hit home in an interview with a leading Israeli journalist\nin the spring of 1998. He asked how my life might have turned out if I’d been born\nand raised not as a kibbutznik, but a Palestinian. I answered: “At some stage, I\nwould have entered one of the terror organizations and fought from there, and later\nwould certainly have tried to influence from within the political system.” I did\nhasten to add that I abhorred terrorists, describing their actions as “abominable…\nvillainous.” But that was lost in the political storm that followed. All I’d done was\nanswer as honestly I could. What if I had been one of the Palestinian babies in\nWadi Khawaret, but with the same mind and same impulses that had defined my\nlife as an Israeli? I assumed that instead of becoming an Israeli soldier and\npolitician, I would have become the closest thing to a Palestinian equivalent. Still,\nas even my brother-in-law, Doron Cohen, told me when he phoned a couple of\nhours later, it was not the most astute thing to say as a potential candidate for\nPrime Minister.\nNone of this might have mattered if I’d been able to show I was bringing Labor\nnearer to defeating Bibi. But the only measure of progress that the media paid\nattention to was the opinion polls. Briefly, in late 1977, I did pull ahead, during the\nperiod leading up to Bibi’s agreement to pull out of most of Hebron. But for much\nof 1998, I was running behind, and questions about my leadership surfaced\npublicly by the summer. The media commentators spoke of the need for a Labor\n“liftoff.” Why, after a full year as leader, had I failed to deliver it?\n* * *\n306\n/ BARAK / 21\nThere was a part of politics for which I was naturally suited after my life in the\narmy: to plan an operation, prepare and execute it. An ability to get the lie of the\nland, assess your own and your rivals’ strengths and vulnerabilities, and to win.\nAnd the “lie of the land” struck me as more encouraging than many Israeli\ncommentators believed. When I became Labor leader, I didn’t expect Bibi to fall\nanytime soon. But I believed it was inevitable that at some point he’d have to make\ntough choices about the peace process, and I doubted his coalition with the more\nright-wing Orthodox parties would survive. I also took encouragement from the\nfact that the political winds in other developed democracies seemed to be blowing\nin our direction. Bill Clinton had won in the United States. In Britain, which had a\nparliamentary system much closer to Israel’s, Tony Blair, as leader of a party\nrenamed as New Labor, had ended eighteen years of Conservative rule and swept\nto victory. Behind the scenes, I immediately made sure that, with financial help\nfrom Jean Frydman and other supporters, we began the practical work of learning\nfrom the experience of center-left parties in other countries.\nWithin weeks of my election as Labor chairman, I used my acquaintance with a\nBritish Jewish businessman named Michael Levy to see what lessons our Labor\nparty might learn from Tony Blair’s. Levy had been an early supporter of Blair and\npersuaded the Prime Minister to welcome me through the famous black door of\nNumber 10 Downing Street. After chatting in the front hallway, the British Prime\nMinister led me into the back garden to discuss how he had refashioned his party\nand brought it back into government. In addition to modifying or abandoning\nrigidly left-wing positions that most British voters had rejected, he had created a\nformidable campaigning team under an ally and adviser named Peter Mandelson.\nWhen I asked Blair whether it would be possible to meet Mandelson, he said he\ncouldn’t “give me Peter.” But he did put me in touch with Philip Gould, the polling\nexpert and strategist who had partnered Mandelson in designing and running the\nelection campaign.\nWe met at Labor headquarters in Milbank Towers so Philip could show me the\n“war room” – modelled, in part, on Bill Clinton’s campaign operation – from\nwhich the victory had been planned and executed. It was a large, open-plan space,\nnothing like the warren of offices and conference rooms from which Labor in\nIsrael operated. Pride of place went to an advanced computer system, the heart of a\n“rebuttal unit” which charted every statement from the Conservative Party so it\ncould be answered, neutralized or used to adjust Labor’s own campaign. I was\n307\n/ BARAK / 22\nstruck by how different the approach was from our campaign for Peres. As I filled\nmy notebook with the details, Philip added a final bit of advice. “If you want to\nwin, have it run by the best professionals you can find. Not politicians. They\nalways have personal agendas. Focus is everything. Distractions and arguments\nand infighting can be fatal.”\nPhilip recommended one professional, in particular, to get us started: Stanley\nGreenberg, the pollster who had advised not only Blair’s campaign, but Clinton’s.\nDoron used his contacts in New York to put us in touch not only with Greenberg\nbut the strategist behind the Clinton victory, James Carville, and another leading\nDemocratic Party consultant and speechwriter, Bob Shrum. We began working\nwith all of them well before the no-confidence vote in the Knesset. Philip had a\nwonderfully British understatement and reserve. Stanley, with his eyeglasses and\ndemeanor too, came over as slightly professorial. With Bob, it didn’t take long to\nunderstand why he was such a gifted speechwriter. He loved words, especially the\nway they could be used to inspire a connection with important campaign themes:\nabove all with the idea of hope, and new beginnings. Carville was the human\nequivalent of a volcano. If he hadn’t been a campaign strategist, he could have\nmade a living as a hybrid of a cowboy and a stand-up comedian. But they all\nshared the easy, infectious self-confidence of people who were very good at what\nthey did, and knew it.\nWhen I went to New York with Doron to meet Carville in Feburary 1988, my\nconfidence as Labor leader was taking some fairly hard knocks. But from the\nmoment he walked through our hotel-room door, it was impossible not to like him.\nHe showed up in a T-shirt and tennis sneakers, walked straight across the room,\nslouched into a chair and said: “General Barak, I don’t get it. You’re a known\npublic figure, with a great mind and a great military record. It’s already been a\nyear-and-a-half since Israel got Netanyahu. What have you done to go after him?\nWhy haven’t you gone on the attack?” He said it was time for me to wake up, and\nchange tack. “Can you run through your stump speech for me,” he asked,\nmotioning me toward the center of the room like a film director.\n“I don’t have one,” I said. To which he replied briskly that I should have had\none months ago.\nWhen Stanley paid a preliminary visit with Philip to Israel, they, too, urged me\nto sharpen my message and pay more attention to my image with the public.\n308\n/ BARAK / 23\nStanley was worried by polling data that suggested most Israelis saw Bibi as\n“strong.” I argued that strength was one area where we wouldn’t have to worry.\n“No way, in a campaign, he’ll end up coming over looking stronger than me.”\nStanley seemed not entirely convinced.\nBoth in “strength” and other ways, I think my background did prove an\nadvantage. The 35 years I’d spent in the military had given me a singleminded\ndetermination to set goals, follow through and achieve them. After Haim Ramon\ncame to my office before the no-confidence vote to ask whether I was sure I\nwanted to go ahead, and I answered with an unhesitating “yes,” Haim had told a\ncouple of reporters: “Barak has balls of steel.” In truth, I was puzzled he’d even\nasked me. As when I was in uniform, it would never have occurred to me to ask\nhim to try to line up the necessary votes if I hadn’t thought it through and intended\nto go ahead with it.\nStill, my military background was not always an asset as I found my feet as\nparty leader and prepared to take on Bibi in the election campaign. In searching for\nthe tools, the structure, and the people I felt would give us the best chance to win, I\nsometimes failed to pay due attention to the party’s existing apparatus and\ninstitutions. This alienated a number of established Labor politicians, eventually\nincluding Haim himself. So as the campaign approached I tried to shore up my ties\nwith the party establishment. I drafted in Bougie Herzog to act as my regular\nliaison with leading figures in the party. I was careful to include a number of Labor\npoliticians in our campaign team as well, though, as Philip Gould had\nrecommended, I made sure they didn’t actually run it.\nThe closest equivalent to the role Haim had played in Peres’s campaign went to\na young businessman, PR professional and Labor supporter named Moshe Gaon.\nAs spokeswoman, we brought in someone who, though she’d been a messenger of\ndoom during the Tze’elim controversy that engulfed me before joining Rabin’s\ngovernment, had undeniable experience and ability which I valued and respected:\nYitzhak’s former media aide Aliza Goren. As campaign coordinator, I chose Tal\nSilberstein, who at the time was in charge of a citizens’ group called Dor Shalem\nDoresh Shalom: “A Whole Generation Demands Peace.” I relied on frequent, less\nformal input from political friends whose judgement I had learned to trust, like\nEitan Haber and Giora Eini. Also playing a key role was a group of four young\nwomen, led by Orna Angel, a successful architect and a former soldier in Sayeret\nMatkal. She built from scratch an army of nearly 20,000 volunteers who helped\n309\n/ BARAK / 24\norganize events and contact voters during the campaign. We outfitted our own war\nroom in an open-plan floor of offices on the edge of Tel Aviv. Philip called it\n“Milbank South.” As organizational head of the campaign, I chose Chagai Shalom.\nAn industrial engineer by training, he was a reserve army general who, when I was\nchief of staff, had been in charge of the logistics branch of the military. I gave him\nSayeret Matkal backup as well, in the person of Danny Yatom, my longtime friend\nand former sayeret deputy.\n* * *\nBut all that was process. Winning or losing would come down to how our\nmessage, our ability to forge alliances, and my own personal and political appeal,\nmeasured up against Bibi.\nThe new system of separate elections for party and Prime Minister meant that in\norder to win a majority, I would need the support of voters outside Labor as well. I\nset out to establish a broader movement, a big tent under which a majority of\nIsraelis could coexist politically. I realized this risked provoking anger among\nsome Labor activists. But I wanted to convey to voters that I was reaching out\nbeyond my core party constituency: to “soft” right-wingers nearer the political\ncenter; to the Sephardim who since 1977 had overwhelmingly voted Likud; to the\ngrowing number of Russian immigrants who had helped Bibi defeat Peres; and to\nthose among the Orthodox who still subscribed to tolerance and moderation in the\nmold of the old-style National Religious Party in the first few decades of the state.\nThough the candidates on our Knesset election list would all be from Labor, I ran\nthe Prime Ministerial campaign under the broader banner of Yisrael Ahat – One\nIsrael. I envisaged it as an alliance of at least several different parties with Labor at\nits center.\nI began with Bibi’s jettisoned Foreign Minister, David Levy. He was a\nMoroccan-born 1950s immigrant whose career had begun at the grassroots, in the\nnorthern town of Beit She’an, but who went on to become a key part of Begin’s\nvictory in 1977. The leading Sephardi figure in the Likud, he was at one point\nmentioned as a future leader. Many Israelis, especially on the left, now portrayed\nhim as a figure of ridicule. But I’d always had a higher opinion of him. During the\n310\n/ BARAK / 25\n1982 Lebanon War, with two sons fighting on the ground, he’d been a rare voice of\ncommon sense, and caution, in the Begin cabinet. I’d also seen him operate in\nShamir’s inner security cabinet, when I would come, as deputy chief of staff, to\npresent military operations for approval. I remember one occasion when an air\nforce general laid out the details of a planned helicopter-borne mission into\nLebanon. I added a few remarks in summary. Raful Eitan and Arik Sharon were\nboth ministers. Within seconds, they were peppering the general and me with\nquestions. Why were the aircraft taking one route north instead of another? Why\nnot closer to Mount Hermon? Shouldn’t they fly lower? Levy interrupted.\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “we are not in company commanders’ course. We’re in the\ninner cabinet of the government of Israel. We have a chief of staff and other\ngenerals and military professionals. It’s their job to decide the operational details.\nOur job is to balance the reasons for doing an operation against the risks as\npresented to us.”\nI met with him in the Knesset cafeteria before Bibi went off to the Wye River\nsummit. Levy now headed a small breakaway faction from Likud called Gesher,\nHebrew for “bridge.” Without explicitly suggesting we join forces, I explained my\nhope to run my eventual campaign for Prime Minister in alliance with a few other\nparties. I told him I wanted to make my candidacy a legitimate choice for voters\nfrom the center-right, the Orthodox, as well as the Russian community. I took a\nnapkin and drew a big umbrella to illustrate what I had in mind. He said he\nunderstood – though he did tell me to make sure I tore up the napkin. There came a\npoint, at the end of November when it looked like my overture had failed.\nScampering for a way to shore up his coalition, Bibi tried to lure Levy into the fold\nback by offering him the Finance Ministry. But with resistance from other\nministers, Bibi broke off the talks with Levy, leaving him humiliated and furious. I\nmet with him several more times, and we brought in Gesher as our first “One\nIsrael” partner. The second to join us, early in the new year, was a small religious\nparty called Meimad, inspired by an openly pro-peace Orthodox rabbi named\nYehuda Amital and including a former Chief Rabbi of Norway, Michael Melchior.\nBy the end of January 1999, several months before the real campaign, I was\nfeeling better about where we stood, in part because of a series of hits Bibi was\ntaking from former friends and allies. The first salvo was fired by Misha Arens,\nwho had helped engineer Bibi’s move into national politics. He announced he was\ngoing to put himself forward for the Likud leadership before the election, saying\n311\n/ BARAK / 26\nthat he and others were convinced Bibi couldn’t win. A couple of weeks later,\nYitzhik Mordechai seemed on the verge of becoming the latest of Bibi’s ministers\nto resign. He was openly flirting with the idea of joining a new centrist party that\nhad been formed by Likud’s Dan Meridor. Bibi struck back with a mixture of\nsubtlety and venom. He fired Mordechai, accusing him of being driven by personal\nambition. Then he offered the Defense Minister’s job to Misha Arens.\nYitzhik did join the Center Party, as did Amnon Lipkin, who had ended his\nterm as chief-of-staff and, with initial opinion poll numbers suggesting he’d do\nwell, even briefly entered the race for Prime Minister. Now, he endorsed Yitzhik\nMordechai instead: a man not only with strong military credentials, but of Sephardi\nbackground and religiously observant, and a proven politician and cabinet minister.\nIt was clear that he would be going after many of the same votes I needed to win.\nThat situation wasn’t ideal, to put it mildly. But all I could do at this stage was\nto put our own campaign house in order. I hoped that if we ran the campaign I\nexpected, there wouldn’t be a run-off.\n* * *\nAt the start of April, the final list of candidates was set. There were five. In\naddition to Bibi, Yitzhik and me, Benny Begin had decided to run on the right.\nAlso in the contest was Knesset member Azmi Beshara, the first Israeli Arab\ncitizen to seek national office.\nWhen we chose “One Israel” as the name of our campaign alliance, it was not\nmeant just as a catchy phrase. Though now a half-century old, the country had\nrarely seemed so diverse, and in many ways divided. It was not just the old fault\nline between Labor and Revisionist Zionism that defined our politics, or even the\nAshkenazi-Sephardi gulf that had predominated since the late 1970s. There were\nnew, younger, more assertive, more right-wing and more pro-settlement voices\namong the Orthodox. There was the contrast between the overwhelmingly secular,\npolitically and socially liberal, and culturally Western Tel Aviv, with its lively\ncafés and restaurants, and the constellation of wealthy suburbs to the north; and\nsmaller Israeli towns and cities in the interior, Jerusalem as well, not to mention\n312\n/ BARAK / 27\nthe settlements on the West Bank. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, hundreds of\nthousands of Russians had also flowed into Israel. Most were Jewish in culture\nmore than religious observance, but they were instinctively inclined to support\ncandidates – Rabin in 1992, and Bibi the last time around – who they felt were\nlikely to take a tough line in any peace negotiations with the Arabs.\nI was never going to get the backing of many West Bank settlers, or of core\nsupporters of the Likud and parties even further to the right. But I would need to\nmake at least some dent in Bibi’s hold on the Russian voters who had supported\nhim by a wide margin in 1996. I focused first on Yisrael Ba’Aliyah, the main\nRussian immigrant political party. It had been set up by the iconic Soviet-era\nrefusenik Natan Sharansky – or, as he was then known, Anatoly Sharansky. He’d\nbeen an ally of Andrei Sakharov, an outspoken human rights advocate and, until he\nwas finally released and allowed to leave in 1986, a political prisoner in the gulag.\nThough Natan’s party was not going to offer a formal endorsement for any\ncandidate, I met with him to press the case for “security and peace,” the message\nI’d tried to advance with Shimon three years earlier, and to emphasize the need to\nbring unity and shared purpose back to the country. Though I think he would have\nbeen receptive anyway, it didn’t hurt that he, like me, was a mathematics graduate\n– from Moscow’s Physics and Technology Institute. He was also a chess\naficionado. When I was rash enough to face him across the board, as I recall, it\ntook him all of five minutes, and seven moves, to checkmate me.\nBut I also made dozens of visits to Russian community groups, and met with\nindividual families whenever I could. Often, I found myself talking to older men\nand women among the immigrants about the military details of the Great Patriotic\nWar, as the Russians called World War Two. On a number of occasions, I accepted\nthe invitation to sit down and play on a sitting-room piano. I think the first time I\ngot a sense that any of this might be having an impact was in a quote from a\nYisrael Ba’Aliyah official in an Israeli newspaper. Though still stopping short of a\nformal endorsement, the official was quoted as saying: “A month ago, young\nRussians thought Barak was a boring, left-wing socialist party leader who doesn’t\nlook good on TV and mumbles a lot... Today, they see him as a high-ranking\nIsraeli general who knows how to play the piano. The Russian immigrants like\nstrong, cultured people.” Except for the bit about mumbling, I couldn’t have\nwished for more.\n313\n/ BARAK / 28\nThe next key moment in the campaign involved something I did not do. This\ntime, the Israeli television debate came earlier in the campaign, a month before the\nelection. Bibi, Yitzhik Mordechai and I were all invited, as the three main\ncandidates. But I told the TV people I had a conflicting personal engagement. I\nfigured I had nothing to gain by going. To join a three-way debate risked creating\nthe impression this was a genuine three-man race, and I still held out hope it would\ncome down to just me and Bibi. Besides, I thought a debate between the other two\nwould help me. Yitzhik knew Bibi well. He had served in Bibi’s government.\nThough not a natural orator, he was always forthright, and often pugnacious, in\nmaking his points. And he couldn’t stand Bibi.\nUnlike the 1996 debate, this time there was a knock-out blow, and Bibi was the\none left on the canvas. It was a bit like Senator Lloyd Bentsen’s killer riposte when\nRepublic vice-presidential candidate Dan Quayle compared himself to John F.\nKennedy in their debate, a few months earlier: “Jack Kennedy was a friend of\nmine. Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy…” Bibi entered his television showdown\nwith Yitzhik Mordechai with much the same strategy he’d used against Peres. He\nwent on the offensive. He tried to portray himself as an indispensable bulwark\nagainst those, like Yitzhik or me, who he said would cosy up to Arafat and Assad\nand endanger Israel’s security. But Yitzhik was up for the fight. He also knew that\nonly months earlier, Bibi himself had been exploring the idea of giving up the\nGolan Heights to the same President Assad. He didn’t actually refer to the secret\nmission by Ronald Lauder, or explicitly accuse Bibi of hypocrisy. But his reply –\nand Bibi’s visible discomfort – were just as effective. Smiling sardonically, he\nsaid: “I know your outbursts, and they won’t do you any good.” He challenged\nBibi to just “look me in the eye” and admit what he really thought about the future\nof the Golan. The media verdict was unanimous. Mordechai had won. Which\nmeant I had won.\nThough my American and British brains’ trust had little input into our day-today\ncampaign, they did play a role in the thrust and strategy. I tried to drive home\ntwo things as we entered the two-week homestretch in May. My first, broad\nmessage was an echo of James Carville’s central theme in the Clinton Presidential\ncampaign: “change, versus more of the same.” It had worked in the US not because\nit was clever, but because it resonated with large numbers of voters. I sensed from\nthe start of the campaign that it was true of Israel as well. Different groups had\ndifferent gripes, and different ideas of what they hoped I would provide as Prime\n314\n/ BARAK / 29\nMinister. But fewer and fewer Israelis were enthusiastic about four more years of\nBibi. But I also was keen to convey the substance of what my premiership would\nbe about. Domestically, I spoke of the need to narrow gaps in education and\nopportunity – particularly, though not only, the continuing disadvantage of many in\nthe Sephardi communities who had arrived in the early years of the state. I wanted\nto try to build bridges between the secular and religious as well. My hope was to\nbegin to recreate the “One Israel” of my youth.\nIn terms of policy, I believed my primary job would be deliver “security and\npeace” – in that order. I declared my commitment to continue, and build on, Oslo\nand to make a new push in negotiations with Syria. Deliberately following the\nmodel Philip Gould had used in Tony Blair’s election campaign, we also\ndistributed nearly a million copies of a six-point policy “pledge card”. It included a\npromise to hold a referendum on any peace deal we reached with Syria or the\nPalestinians, as well as several domestic policy pledges, including an end to\ndiscrimination against Russian immigrants whose Jewish religious status had been\ncalled into question.\nYet the most widely reported promise was that I would pull out all Israeli troops\nfrom Lebanon within a year. I realized that even among those who knew that made\nsense, voices would be raised both in the Knesset and the kiyra against\nwithdrawing. As with the Bar-Lev Line before the 1973 War, the longer the\n“security zone” was in place, the more difficult that politicians had found it to say\nit was a mistake. Yet it had now been there for nearly two decades. The main\nargument for keeping it – that it protected the security of northern Israel – was\nundermined by the fact that thousands of Katyusha rockets had been fired over it.\nAnd in the low-grade war we were fighting against Hizbollah inside the security\nzone, around 20 Israeli soldiers had been dying each and every year. When I’d first\nvisited our positions in south Lebanon in the early 1980s, chatted with the troops\nand asked them how they were doing, the invariable response was: we’re OK.\nWe’re just worried about our young kids back home. Now, those children were\nmanning the same outposts, facing the same danger, in a sliver of land on which\nwe had no claim, which we had no desire to hold, and which was, at best, of\nquestionable security value.\n* * *\n315\n/ BARAK / 30\nI’d tried not to pay too much attention to newspaper polls during the campaign,\nperhaps because even the “good” ones, to use Shimon’s phrase, had me with just a\nnarrow lead, with Yitzhik Mordechai’s 10 or 11 percent still likely to prevent\noutright victory in the first round. But in the second part of May, our internal\npolling showed things were moving in our direction. In mid-May, they had me\nabove 40 percent. A final batch of internal polls, on the Friday before election day,\nhad me just short of 50 percent. But I told our pollsters that under no circumstances\nwere they to divulge the results to anyone in the campaign team. This wasn’t just\nbecause I wanted to guard against complacency. It was because, deep down, still I\ndidn’t trust the numbers.\nI retreated to Kochav Yair on Friday evening. On Saturday, two days before the\nelection, I had a surprise visitor, someone I knew from Yitzhik Mordecai’s team.\nHe said he had a letter for me, with terms of a proposal under which Yitzhik would\nannounce an eleventh-hour withdrawal from the race. I still could not be absolutely\nconfident I’d win, at least in the first round. Yitzhik’s pulling out would help. But\nif I did win, I wanted to start the process of assembling a coalition with a blank\nslate and an open mind. Doing a deal was not the way to begin. I didn’t accept or\nopen the envelope. “Go back to Yitzhik,” I said. “Tell him, as he knows, that I\nhave a lot of respect for him. But this is a decision that he has to make on his own.”\nThe next day, less than 24 hours before the polls opened, all of the three other\ncandidates announced they were pulling out. Benny Begin and Azmi Beshara were\nnever going to affect the outcome. But Yitzhik’s withdrawal very possibly would.\nWhen he spoke to reporters, he said it had been one of the most difficult decisions\nhe’d had to make, but that he’d concluded he wouldn’t get enough votes to reach\nhis “primary goal” of defeating Bibi. “The prime minister was given a chance and\nhe failed,” he said. “We must give Barak a chance.”\nI got up early on May 17, confident we’d done everything we could to put\nourselves in a position to win, but also aware, from Shimon’s defeat, that the\nsmallest of details, and the narrowest of margins, might determine the outcome.\nAfter the 1996 election, I’d learned of cases where Peres volunteers outside polling\nstations in the Negev or the north of the country had left early, in order to make\nsure they’d be back to Tel Aviv in time for the “moment of victory.” Now, I sent\nout word that all our volunteers must stay in place until the polls had closed. After\n316\n/ BARAK / 31\nNava and I voted, we attended an event for Labor supporters north of Tel Aviv,\nbefore flying to Beersheva to spend the final hours in the Negev. I’d arranged for\nShlomo Ben-Ami to go to Kiryat Shmona in the north – emphasizing, as\nthroughout the campaign, our determination to broaden our support beyond\nLabor’s heartland. The polls closed at 10 o’clock. I knew Bibi would be staring at\nthe same Channel One newscast as I was, each of us ready to put the best spin on\nthings, especially if there was no clear sign at this stage which one of us had won.\nBut the exit poll findings came as a shock: Barak, of One Israel, 58.5 percent;\nNetanyahu, Likud, 41.5 percent. It was a landslide.\nThe full impact hit me only when I got to the fifth-floor suite in the Dan Hotel\nin Tel Aviv, our election-night headquarters. My three brothers, and Nava and our\ndaughters, were waiting for me. Leah Rabin, too. Our eyes teared up as we\nembraced. My parents were by now too frail to come. But I’d promised to phone\nthem, whatever happened. “We did it,” I told my father, who said mazaltov with a\ndepth of feeling which had become rare as his health began to fail. My mother had\nalways been a bit conflicted about my going into politics, despite her lifelong\nbelief that the issues of politics mattered, especially after Yitzhak had been cut\ndown and killed for following the path on which I hoped to continue. Still, I could\nhear the pride, and relief, in her voice when I said: “Remember, ima. I did promise\nyou that if I ran, at least I’d make sure to win.”\nWhen we’d finished speaking, Bibi called. He had conceded publicly as soon\nas the exit poll was out. He had also stunned the Likud crowd by immediately\nresigning as party leader. “Congratulations,” he said, sounding, more than\nanything, tired. “I accept that the voters have spoken.” I thanked him for taking the\ntrouble to call. I said I appreciated the contribution he’d made to the country, and\nthat we’d meet in the next few days to discuss how best to handle the political\ntransition. “Thanks,” Bibi said. “And again, mazaltov.”\nBy the time I got off the phone with Bibi, the TV was showing pictures of tens\nof thousands of people celebrating the results in the central Tel Aviv square, now\nrenamed in Rabin’s memory, where he had been murdered nearly four years\nearlier. Before leaving to join them, I fielded a stream of calls: from friends, other\nIsraeli party leaders and leaders from abroad, including Tony Blair and Bill\nClinton, both of whom not only offered warm congratulations but said they looked\nforward to working with me as I tried to move Israel forward and to finish the\nwork Yitzhak had begun.\n317\n/ BARAK / 32\nAt the start of my brief remarks at the hotel podium before going to Rabin\nSquare, I had to call for quiet when I mentioned the phone call from Bibi. “No,” I\nsaid, raising my voice to be heard above the boos, “we will not boo an incumbent\nPrime Minister of Israel… A short time ago, I spoke with Prime Minister\nNetanyahu and thanked him for his service to the State of Israel.” Then – with both\nLeah and Shimon Peres at my side – I paid tribute to “that one special person who\nhad a unique role in our reaching this moment – somebody who was my\ncommander and guide, and the person who led me into politics: Yitzhak Rabin. I\npledged to fulfil his legacy, and complete the work he’d started. And I extended a\nhand to “secular and religious, the ultra-Orthodox and the residents of the\nsettlements, to Israelis of Middle Eastern origin and Ashkenazi extraction, to\nimmigrants from Eithopia and the former Soviet Union, to the Arabs, the Druze,\nthe Circassians, the Bedouin. All, all of them, are part of the Israeli people.”\nIt was not long before sunrise when I reached the square. As the crowd shouted\nand sang, I began with a line borrowed from Bob Shrum. It seemed particularly\napt: “It is the breaking of a new dawn,” I said.\nBut was it? As I paid tribute to Rabin – “in this place where our hearts broke” –\nand dedicated myself to completing the work he’d begun, I could feel the\nthousands in the square willing me on. Even in my more nuanced comments on the\ntalks with the Palestinians: the need to achieve peace, but at least for now by\ndisengaging rather than joining hands with the Palestinians, ensuring we had\nmilitary and border provisions to safeguard our security, and with the stipulation\nthat Jerusalem would remain our undivided capital, under Israeli sovereignty. But\nsome in the crowd were carrying posters saying “No to the charedim” – the strictly\nOrthodox. Others were chanting, in anticipation of the negotiations needed to put\ntogether a coalition: Rak lo Shas! Anyone but Shas! It was a reference to the\nSephardi Orthodox party, which in addition to being more nuanced and flexible\nthan other religious parties on the issue of peace talks, had been the big winner in\nthe election. It had gained seven seats and now had only two fewer than the Likud.\nI did not specifically mention Shas. But I said: “I tell you here that the time has\ncome to end divisions. The time has come to make peace among ourselves,\nwhether we are traditionalists or secularists… We must not be enemies of each\nother.” Paying tribute to all those in the square who had worked for our election\nvictory, I added: “I know it would not have been possible without your support.\nBut I also know it would not have been possible without the support many in the\n318\n/ BARAK / 33\nLikud. I appreciate that as well. And I undertake to be rosh hasmemshalah shel\nkulam: Prime Minister for all Israelis.\nYet as fervently as I hoped to be able deliver on that pledge, I knew, even as I\nspoke, that actually fulfilling it was going to be much, much tougher.\n319\n/ BARAK / 34\nChapter Twenty\nAs Prime Minister, I would sometimes be criticised as emotionally buttoned up,\neven stoic, and there was some truth in that. It was partly just a reflection of who I\nwas: a kibbutznik who’d grown up in the early years of the state, and had then\nspent most of his life in the army. But while it may not have shown, I felt a churn\nof emotions when I formally presented my government to the Knesset in July 1999\nas Nava, our three daughters, her parents and mine looked on proudly from the\ngallery. Even more so, when I entered the office of the Prime Minister. I’d been\nthere before: as head of military intelligence, chief of staff and a cabinet minister.\nYet to sit behind the vast wooden desk and know that the buck now truly stopped\nwith me – to become just the tenth person in Israel’s history to have that honor –\nwas very different.\nWhat I felt most powerfully, however, wasn’t the honor. It was the\nresponsibility. I knew that Israel faced two deepening crises. The first was\ndomestic. Though Yitzhak Rabin’s assassin was now in jail, the divisiveness and\nhatred of which he was a product and symbol had not gone away. Nor had other\nrifts: between the privileged and disadvantaged, Ashkenazim and Sephardim, and,\nperhaps most of all, secular and religious. The second, more immediate challenge\nwas on our borders. The peace process was stalled. If we were going to revive it,\nwe were running against the clock. President Clinton, a key player in any hope of\nturning the promise of Oslo into real peace, had only 18 months remaining in\noffice. In terms of Israel’s security, the timetable was even less forgiving. From my\nvery first intelligence briefings as Prime Minister, I was even more convinced of\nwhat I’d been warning Bibi for months: without a political breakthrough, a new,\nmuch more deadly intifada was only a matter of time.\nThat would have been reason enough to make peace efforts my first priority.\nBut even as I was addressing the victory rally in Rabin Square, I sensed that the\nsimple arithmetic of the election results would leave me no other choice. I was\nentering office with the largest electoral mandate in our history. But that was\nbecause of Israel’s new voting system, with separate ballots cast for Prime Minister\nand party. That system had had precisely the opposite effect on party voting. In\nprevious elections, most Israelis had chosen one of the two main parties, knowing\nthat only they had a realistic chance of forming a government. Now they could\ndirectly choose the Prime Minister, giving them the luxury to vote in much greater\n320\n/ BARAK / 35\nnumbers for an array of smaller, issue-specific parties. The result: though I’d won\nby a landslide, and One Israel had the largest number of Knesset seats, even with\nour natural left-of-center ally, Meretz, we would have only 36 Knesset seats – well\nshort of the 61 needed for a majority. Even if we included a few smaller parties,\nthere was no choice but to bring in one of the two larger ones: the Sephardi\nOrthodox Shas, with 17 seats; or Likud, which, after Bibi’s sudden resignation,\nwas now led by Arik Sharon, and had 19.\nIt wasn’t just a math problem. It had a critical policy implication. If I wanted to\ntackle the domestic challenge – to reassert the values of secular-led democratic\ngovernment over increasingly assertive religious involvement in our day-to-day\npolitics – that would mean choosing Likud over Shas. But it would also signal the\neffective end of the peace process. Even though Arik assured me privately that he\nunderstood my determination to reopen peace efforts with Arafat and Hafez al-\nAssad, I knew Arik. The path toward peace agreements, assuming they were even\npossible, would be tough. Sooner or later – and certainly if we faced the need to\nconsider painful compromises in the negotiations – I was certain that Arik would\nact as a kind of opposition from within. That was why, over the angry opposition\nof Meretz leader Yossi Sarid, I decided to go with the Sephardi Orthodox party. I\nrealized that even Shas might walk out if the scale of any land-for-peace\nconcessions proved too high. But it was the least extreme of the major religious\nparties on the question of peace with the Palestinians. In my conversations with the\nparty’s spiritual leader and guide, the 79-year-old rabbi and Talmudic scholar\nOvadia Yosef, I was struck by his intelligence, erudition and subtletly of thought –\nbut, above all, his commitment to the core Jewish principle of sanctifying human\nlife over the specifics of Oslo redeployments, where his inclination seemed to be to\ntrust the judgment of those with the experience and expertise to evaluate the\nsecurity implications.\nTo Meretz’s additional consternation, I included two smaller, right-of-center\nOrthodox parties in the coalition. It was not just to make good on my pledge to be\nPrime Minister for all Israelis. Knowing that I was going to put top priority on the\npeace process, I wanted to avoid an undiluted left-of-centre, secular thrust to the\ngovernment. When I’d stood in front of the tens of thousands of cheering\nsupporters in Rabin Square after the election, I thought to myself: they think that\nwith Bibi gone, peace is around the corner. I wanted a coalition broad enough to\nkeep Meretz, and Labor ministers as well, from forgetting a crucial fact: the\n321\n/ BARAK / 36\ncompromises that we might have to contemplate during peace negotiations were\nstill anathema to many other Israelis.\n* * *\nSyria was always my first negotiating priority, as it had been for Rabin and, for\na brief period, Bibi as well. This was not just because the shape of a final\nagreement with the Syrians was clearer, to both sides, than with the Palestinians. It\nwas because I was determined to make good on the main specific policy pledge of\nmy campaign: to bring our troops home from Lebanon. No matter what the\nincreasingly emboldened fighters of Hizbollah said publicly, our withdrawal would\nbe bad news for them. It would deprive them of their “anti-occupation” rationale\nfor firing Katyushas into towns and settlements in northern Israel, and free us\npolitically to strike back hard if that proved necessary. It was clear to me that\nHizbollah would try to make the withdrawal as difficult for us as possible. But the\nreal power in Lebanon rested with the Syrians, who, along with Iran, were\nHizbollah’s main backers. If we could get a peace agreement with Assad, there\nseemed every reason to hope he would rein in Hizbollah, and perhaps open the way\nto a peace treaty with Lebanon as well.\nStill, there was no way of hiding an additional attraction in getting a deal with\nSyria first: it would increase our negotiating leverage with the Palestinians. That\nwould certainly not be lost on Yasir Arafat – one reason that I realized the\nimportance of an early meeting with him, to convey my commitment to keeping\nthe Oslo process alive, and, if possible, achieving a full and final Israeli-Palestinian\npeace.\n* * *\nI went to see Arafat a few days after taking office. We met for well over an\nhour at Erez, the main crossing point into Gaza. It was swelteringly hot inside. At\nleast I was in an ordinary business suit, but I couldn’t help wondering how Arafat\n322\n/ BARAK / 37\nwas coping in his trademark military uniform. Still, the mood music going into the\nmeeting was encouraging. After the election, Arafat had tried to use his ties with\nthe ayatollahs in Iran to get them to release 13 members of the tiny Jewish\ncommunity in Shiraz who had been jailed on patently absurd accusations of spying\nfor the “Zionist régime.” Iran had told him no. Given its support for Hizbollah, and\nits serial diatribes about destroying the State of Israel, this was hardly a surprise.\nBut it was a gesture nonetheless, and I told him I appreciated it. I also arrived with\na gift: a leather-bound volume with both the Hebrew Bible and Koran. I began our\nmeeting with what I felt I most needed him to hear: that both of us were trying to\nachieve something hugely important, nothing less than a new relationship between\nIsraelis and Palestinians based on trust. As I would discover in the months ahead –\nas Yitzhak had found as well – Arafat responded warmly to such general appeals\nof principle. He replied that he viewed me as a partner, and a friend. But the key\nissue of substance – the difference between how I envisaged taking Oslo forward\nand what he wanted – was impossible to avoid.\nI emphasized that I was committed to the further Wye River summit\nredeployments Bibi which had agreed, although not implemented, as well as to a\nrelease of Palestinian prisoners agreed at Wye. Yet then came the more difficult\npart: explaining my view of how we could best move toward a full peace\nagreement. I said I was convinced the prospects would be much better if we\ndelayed the redeployments and brought forward the start of the real negotiations:\non “permanent-status” issues like final borders, settlements, Jerusalem, refugees. In\nany case, I said, I’d need a few months for a thorough assessment of the issues\ninvolved, and to reach a settled view with my negotiating team on how to proceed.\nArafat seemed to accept the idea of a pause for reflection and planning. But he held\nfirm in his opposition to any further delay in the Wye redeployments. More\nworryingly for the longer-term prospects of an agreement, he ignored altogether\nmy suggestion that we move ahead toward the permanent-status talks.\nSpeaking to reporters, I was careful to accentuate the positive. I said the reason\nI’d come to see Arafat so soon was because of the importance I attached to his role\nin “shaping peace in the Middle East.” I said I would not waver in continuing on\nthe path which Rabin and he and begun. And while the security of Israel would be\nmy paramount concern in negotiations, “I also want each Palestinian to feel\nsecure.” Both sides, I said, had suffered enough. The open question, however, was\nwhether I had done enough to persuade Arafat that his exclusive focus on\n323\n/ BARAK / 38\nredeployments – on only the land part of a land-for-peace deal – meant we risked\nignoring the core issues that would determine whether a full peace agreement was\nachievable.\nMore urgently, I knew from our diplomats in the US that the Americans would\nnot necessarily be receptive to a further delay in moving ahead with Oslo, even if it\nmeant focusing on trying to make peace with Syria. That made my first visit to see\nPresident Clinton as Prime Minister especially important.\n* * *\nIt was billed as a “working visit” and work we did. After a gala dinner for Nava\nand me in the White House, we helicoptered to the presidential retreat at Camp\nDavid. President Clinton and I spent more than 10 hours discussing shared security\nchallenges in the Middle East, especially terrorist groups and states like Iran that\nwere backing them, and, of course, how best to move forward our efforts to\nnegotiate peace. These face-to-face meetings set a pattern that would last\nthroughout the time he and I were in office. On almost all key issues, my\npreference was to deal directly with the President, something I know sometimes\nfrustrated other senior US negotiators like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\nand Mideast envoy Dennis Ross. This was not out of any disrespect for them. It\nwas because the decisions on which negotiations would succeed or fail would have\nto be made at the top, just as President Clinton and I would ultimately carry the\nresponsibility, or the blame, for errors, missteps or missed opportunities.\nOur first meeting ran until three in the morning. When the President asked me\nhow I saw the peace process going forward, he smiled, in obviously relief, at my\nanswer: I wanted to move quickly. He had only a limited time left in office, and I\nwas determined that we not waste it. Much is often made about the personal\n“chemistry” in political relationships. Too much, I think, because the core issues,\nand the trade-offs of substance, are what truly matter when negotiating matters of\nthe weight, and long-term implications, of Middle East peace. Still, chemistry does\nhelp when moments of tension or crisis arise, as they inevitably do. My first few\ndays with President Clinton laid a foundation that allowed us to work together even\nwhen things got tough. I benefited, I’m sure, simply by not being Bibi. The\n324\n/ BARAK / 39\npresident and his negotiating team had spent the previous few, frustrating years\ntrying alternately to urge, nudge and cajole him – and, of course, Arafat – toward\nimplementing Oslo. Clinton did finally succeed in getting the Wye River\nagreement. But it, too, remained to be implemented.\nNava’s presence, and Hillary Clinton’s, contributed to an informal, familial\natmosphere. Before my first round of talks with the President, we joined Bill and\nHillary for dinner. Though I would work more closely with Hillary in later years,\nwhen she was Secretary of State under President Obama, this was the first time I’d\nhad the opportunity to engage in anything more than small talk with her. She was\nless naturally outgoing than her husband. Yet not only was she bright and\narticulate. She was barely less informed on the ins and outs of Middle East peace\nnegotiations than the President. She, and Bill as well, also spoke with us about\nthings well beyond the diplomacy of the Middle East: science, music, and our\nshared interest in history. What most struck Nava and me, however, was the way\nthe Clintons interacted with each other. The scandal surrounding Monica Lewinsky\nwas still fresh. I suppose we expected to see signs of tension. Whether they were\nthere, we had no way of knowing. But what the two of them did palpably have was\na deep respect for each other’s intelligence, insight and creativity in looking for\nsolutions where so many others saw only problems. It was impressive.\nStill, there was little small talk in the long discussions I had with the President.\nFrom the outset, I wanted him to know exactly what I hoped we could accomplish\nand how, in my view, we were most likely to get there. I wasn’t trying to impose\n“ground rules” on the President of the United States, something I neither would nor\ncould do. But I was explicit with him about my own approach the negotiations. I\nassured him I was prepared to be flexible. But I said I’d be relying on two critical\nassumptions. The first was that when we and the Americans agreed a position on a\nspecific issue, there would be no unilateral “surprises” – by which I meant, though\ndidn’t say, things like the unfortunate American redefinition of Yitzhak’s “pocket\ndeposit” assurance regarding the Golan. The second assumption, I know, may\nseem overly legalistic. It was that, until and unless we reached a full and final\nagreement with either Syria or the Palestinians, any Israeli negotiating ideas or\nproposals would not be binding. If no agreement was reached, they would become\nnull and void. I wanted to avoid a situation, as had happened so often in past\nnegotiations, where an Israeli proposal was rejected by the Arab side but then\ntreated as the opening position in the expectation of further concessions in later\n325\n/ BARAK / 40\ntalks. I did realize that, “null and void” or not, our proposals or suggestions would\nnot simply disappear from memory. But I felt the point of principle was essential if\nIsrael was going to be able to consider the kind of far-reaching concessions which\nfinal peace deals might require.\nIn the end, I realized that we might simply discover that Assad, and certainly\nArafat, were not willing or ready to make peace. We might, initially at least, have\nto settle for a more incremental step. “Right here in Camp David, Begin, Sadat and\nCarter couldn’t complete the process,” I pointed out. “They signed a ‘framework\nagreement’ and it took months of further diplomacy to reach a peace treaty. Maybe\nwe’ll end up doing the same.” But I told the President I was convinced that if we\ndidn’t try to get agreements, we’d have no way of knowing whether the will to\nmake peace was there on the other side. Assad, I suspected, was the more likely to\nreciprocate. That was a major reason I wanted to start our efforts with him. But so\nfar, his true intentions had never been tested, beyond his obvious determination to\nget back the Golan. Nor had Arafat’s, beyond his focus on the detail and extent of\nWest Bank redeployments.\nPresident Clinton did not object to an early effort to reopen our efforts with the\nSyrians. But he was worried about the effects of ignoring the already-creaking\nprospects of fulfilling the promise of Oslo. If we were going to delay focusing on\nthat, Clinton told me, he needed to be able to assure Arafat the wait would be\nworth his while. What could we give the PLO leader in return for putting off the\nWye redeployments further, he asked. And then, the real question on his mind:\n“Ehud, when we get to the final redeployment and a peace deal, how much of the\nWest Bank are you prepared to hand back?”\nI simply didn’t know at this stage. Much would depend on whether we could be\nsure Arafat could or would deliver a final peace. But even if I had known, I would\nhave been reluctant to name a precise percentage. Though I had full trust in\nPresident Clinton, I knew that everything he and I said would be shared with at\nleast a few of his closest policy aides and negotiators. Sooner or later, word would\nget to Arafat. When we did begin negotiations, he’d take whatever number I gave\nas a mere starting point. Still, I knew I had to signal the President that I was serious\nabout negotiating with Arafat when the time came. I also knew the main source of\nhis concern. In order to get the agreement at Wye, the President had signed on to a\nprovision that the dimension of the third and final redeployment phase would be\ndetermined by Israel alone. By that stage, when we got there, Arafat would have\n326\n/ BARAK / 41\ncontrol of something like 40 percent of the West Bank. That meant – at least in\ntheory – that Israel could limit phase-three to a mere token pullout, leaving the\nPalestinians with less than half of the territory.\n“I don’t know what percentage, exactly,” I replied. “But one of my cabinet\nministers thinks that a formula of 70-10-20 would work, meaning 70 percent for\nthe Palestinians, ten percent to allow us to retain and secure the largest of the\nsettlement blocs, and the rest to be worked out in further talks.” When he nodded, I\nadded: “Peres thinks it could end up at 80-20, and says he thinks Arafat would find\nit hard to walk away from getting control of four-fifths of the West Bank. But it’s\nnot about the number. It’s about the area needed for the major settlements, and\nwhatever else is required to safeguard our security. Beyond that, we don’t need a\nsingle inch of the West Bank, and we won’t ask for a single inch.”\nI replied in much the same vein when President Clinton urged me to help kickstart\nnew talks with Assad by formally reaffirming Yitzhak’s “pocket deposit” on\nthe Golan Heights. As with the Palestinians, I was not going to cede a major\nnegotiating card – our only real negotiating card – before we had any indication\nAssad was serious about making peace. But I did feel it was necessary to reassure\nClinton that I was serious. I told him that, if and when the Syrians showed real\nsigns of readiness to address our needs in a peace agreement, I would reaffirm the\n“pocket deposit.”\nI’d come to Washington hoping that President Clinton would be with me on the\nmain issues of substance. But what I needed most at this point was his support on\nthe procedural decisions I’d made in order to get to real peace negotiations:\nengaging with Syria first, and shifting the emphasis on the Palestinian track away\nfrom the redeployments toward the core permanent-status issues we’d have to\nresolve in order to get a peace agreement. What emerged from my first meetings\nwith President Clinton was essentially a trade-off. He knew I would be ready to\nmake concessions in pursuit of genuine peace. I was confident that on the route\nthat I was proposing to take, he would have my back.\nBut what I couldn’t be sure of was whether my own government would have\nmy back. On paper, we had a comfortable Knesset majority: 75 out of the 120\nseats. But I knew it was inherently vulnerable, both to friction between the\nOrthodox parties and assertively secular MKs from Meretz and inside Labor, and\nto possible defections over the concessions we might have to consider in peace\n327\n/ BARAK / 42\nnegotiations. The first stirrings of discontent had begun even before I went to see\nClinton. On the basis of my commitment merely to try for peace, Arik Sharon had\npresented a no-confidence motion in the Knesset. It was never going to pass. But\nonly days after I’d made him Interior Minister, Natan Sharansky let it be known he\nwas going to vote against us. He didn’t. He stayed away from the chamber, in\neffect abstaining. But I’d been put on notice.\nI did lose my first coalition partner in September: the small United Torah\nJudaism party, with five Knesset seats. It wasn’t over land-for-peace. In an echo of\na similar crisis that brought down the government during Rabin’s first spell as\nPrime Minister in the 1970s, it was over a violation of the Jewish Sabbath. It\nturned out that Israel’s state electric company had been transporting a huge steamcondensation\nmachine from the manufacturing site near Haifa to a power plant in\nAshdod. The unit was the size of a small apartment. It weighed 100 tons. It\ncouldn’t be driven across the country without bringing weekday traffic to a\nstandstill. The obvious solution was to do it when road use was lightest, on\nShabbat. Precisely the same procedure had been followed – 24 times – under Bibi.\nBut when I asked a United Torah Judaism leader why he’d seemed happy when\nLikud had waved it through, he replied: “Past sins cannot pardon future ones.” Eli\nSuissa, one of the Shas ministers in the cabinet, took his side, saying: “Every hour\nis good for the keeping of Shabbat.” Most other ministers agreed with me that we\nshould stand firm. So I did. But UTJ walked out of the government. Shas did\nremain. But I was now increasingly certain that at some stage its ministers, too,\nwould leave.\nIn the midst of the Sharanksy rebellion, Haim Ramon, who was the minister in\ncharge of liaising with the Knesset, insisted I “punish” him for his political\ngrandstanding. “You should fire Sharansky. Act like a leader!” I just laughed. “The\ncoalition doesn’t need a leader,” I replied. “It needs therapy.” In truth, I suspected\nthat if we ever got near to a peace agreement with Assad or Arafat, even therapy\nmight not help. But that was a main reason that I’d promised a referendum on any\nfinal peace deals. I believed that in the choice between concessions, even painful\nones, and a genuine peace deal with Syria or the Palestinians, by far most Israelis\nwould choose peace.\nI relied on a strong, close team around me, people I knew well and who shared\nmy determination to stay focused on the central goal: to put Israel in a position\nwhere its citizens could be given that choice. I made Danny Yatom, my former\n328\n/ BARAK / 43\nsayeret deputy, my chief of staff. The negotiating team also included Uri Saguy,\nformer head of military intelligence; Gilad Sher, a gifted lawyer I’d known for a\nquarter of a century and who had been a company commander in my armored\nbrigade in the 1970s; and Amnon Lipkin, the paratroop commander at Chinese\nFarm and my successor as ramatkal when I left the army. Also, Shlomo Ben-Ami,\nthe Moroccan-born, Oxford-educated historian and diplomat who had run against\nme for the Labor leadership. Shlomo had a gift for systematic analysis and keen\njudgement, especially on security issues, which I highly valued.\nIt did not escape the attention of Israeli commentators, or other politicians, that\nalmost all of them were former soldiers whom I’d known from my time in uniform.\nBut that observation missed a more important point: we were all members of the\n“generation of 1967 and 1973.” We had been soldiers during the Six-Day War. In\nthe years immediately after it, like almost all Israelis, we had allowed ourselves to\nbelieve that our victory had been so comprehensive, and so quick, that any threat\nfrom the defeated Arab states was gone for good. We assumed that inevitably,\ninexorably, they would realize they needed to sue for peace, and that there was no\nparticular urgency on our part to do anything more than wait. Then, on Yom\nKippur 1973, all of that had been turned on its head. We had not only learned the\nlessons, of 1973. We had internalized them. Even had we not known of the danger\nof a new Palestinian campaign of terror, the option of simply watching and waiting\n– and assuming that our military strength, which was now even greater, could\nmake events around us stand still – would not have made sense to us. Besides, as I\nremarked to Danny and others, to do so would run against the founding purpose of\nZionism: to establish a state where Jews would no longer be victims of events, but\nwould take control of their destiny and try to shape them.\n* * *\nYet making peace, like making war, takes two. Much as I’d wanted to begin\nwith Syria, until well into the autumn of 1999 President Assad was holding firm on\nhis insistence that without our “deposit,” without a prior agreement that he’d get\nback the Golan, there could be no substantive progress. This was particularly\nfrustrating because I was getting reports from our intelligence services, and\n329\n/ BARAK / 44\nWestern envoys who had seen the Syrian president, that Assad’s many years of\nhealth problems had left him almost skeletally frail, even at times disoriented.\nEven my own negotiating team urged me to concentrate on the Palestinians\ninstead. President Clinton kept stressing the importance of showing Arafat at least\nsome movement on the Oslo front. In September 1999, I took a first, significant\nstep in that direction. I agreed to a timetable that would deliver the Wye\nredeployments by the end of January 2000, while also committing us to negotiating\na framework agreement, on the model of the Begin-Sadat Camp David accords, on\nthe “permanent-status” peace issues. In early November, I joined Clinton and\nArafat for talks around an event in Oslo – a deliberate echo of the optimism with\nwhich the peace process had begun, held on the fourth anniversary of Rabin’s\nassassination. Both Leah Rabin and Peres came with me. Its centerpiece was a\nmemorial service, at which Leah spoke very movingly of the need for both sides to\nfinish the work Yitzhak had begun, a responsibility I pledged that we would do\neverything in our power to fulfill. Only Arafat struck a discordant note. He paired a\ntribute to Rabin with a polemic call for an end to “occupation, exile and\nsettlements.”\nAfter the ceremony, he, President Clinton and I met at the American\nambassador’s residence. I was still struck by Arafat’s public comments: by his\napparent desire, or need, to play to hardliners back home in what was supposed to\nbe a time to remember and honor Yitzhak. I didn’t raise his remarks directly, but I\ntold him that each of us was approaching a moment of truth for the future of our\npeople. The decisions required wouldn’t be easy politically, for either of us. “But if\nwe don’t have the courage to make them, we’ll be burying thousands of our\npeople.” Worse, I said, those deaths would not advance his people’s position, or\nmine, by a single inch. When future Palestinian and Israeli leaders did finally prove\nequal to the challenge of making peace, they’d be looking at the same conflict,\nrequiring the same compromises. “The only difference will be the size of our\ncemeteries.” Arafat nodded occasionally. But he said little, beyond saying that he\nconsidered Rabin to have been a friend, and repeating his now-familiar,\nnonspecific, pledge to “do what is necessary” for peace.\n“The hardest part won’t be the tough decisions in negotiations,” I continued. “It\nwon’t be facing each other. It will be facing our own people.” We would need to\nmake the case openly, honestly, strongly that the peace agreement we reached was\nin the interest of both Israelis and Palestinians. And in this, each of us had a\n330\n/ BARAK / 45\nresponsibility to support the other. With President Clinton looking on, I steered\nArafat toward the window of the ambassador’s fifth-floor apartment. “Look\ndown,” I said. “Imagine that we each have parachutes, and we’re going to jump\ntogether. But I have my hand on your ripcord, and you are holding mine. To land\nsafely we have to help each other… And if we don’t jump, many, many innocent\npeople who are now walking the streets of Gaza and Ramallah and Hebron, Tel\nAviv and Jerusalem, will die.” Arafat again just nodded, leaving me, and the\nPresident, unsure whether anything I’d said had struck home.\nThe true test of that would come only when we got to the stage of negotiations\nwhen the “difficult decisions” could not be evaded. Yet only weeks after I returned\nfrom Oslo, the focus did finally shift to the Syrians. President Assad suddenly\nsignalled his willingness to resume talks without any preconditions – a message he\ndelivered first to my British Labor Party friend Michael Levy, who was visiting\nDamascus as Tony Blair’s roving Mideast envoy, and then to Secretary of State\nMadeleine Albright. Assad said he would send Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-\nSharaa to meet me for initial talks in Washington in December, ahead of a fullscale,\nUS-mediated attempt to negotiate peace at the start of the new year.\n* * *\nThe broad terms of a potential deal had long been clear, both to us and the\nSyrians. The danger was always that the process would get derailed, or never really\nget started, due to domestic political opposition. Syria had a tightly state-controlled\nmedia and an intelligence service concerned mainly with crushing any signs of\ndissidence. That meant Assad’s main concern was to ensure broad support, or at\nleast acquiescence, from top military and party figures. In Israel, however, every\nsign of a concession would risk igniting charges that we were “selling out” to\nSyria. The Likud and the political right would obviously denounce the idea of\ngiving up the Golan Heights, even though Bibi had been ready to do just that when\nhe was Prime Minister. But even on the left, there was little enthusiasm for\nreturning the Golan. There were far fewer Israeli settlers there than on the West\nBank, not even 20,000. But most of them, far from being religiously motivated\nideologues, were Labor supporters. And almost no Israel, of any political stripe,\n331\n/ BARAK / 46\nviewed Hafez al-Assad as a natural partner for peace. For years, he’d been a\nconstant, sneering presence on our northern border, denouncing not only Sadat but\nany Arab leader who’d shown willingness to engage or negotiate with Israel. Amos\nOz, one of our finest writers and a cultural icon for Labor Zionists, probably put it\nbest. He said the Syrians seemed to think that “we will give them the Golan, and\nthey’ll send us a receipt by fax.” The consensus was: forget Assad. Keep the\nGolan. In fact, before I left for the US, the Knesset voted on whether it supported\nmy attempt to negotiate an agreement with Syria. We could muster only 47 votes,\n14 short of a majority. An opinion poll found only 13 percent of Israelis favored a\nfull withdrawal from the Golan.\nThe message I drew from this was not that we should give up on the chances of\na peace agreement. After all, before Begin and Sadat went to Camp David in 1978,\nan almost equally tiny minority of Israelos had been in favor of withdrawing from\nthe Sinai. Yet once they had seen the other side of the equation – full, formal peace\nwith our most powerful neighbor – the opposition all but evaporated. The problem\nI saw was that if we and the Syrians couldn’t find a way to insulate our\nnegotiations from leaks, speculation and a swirl of opposition to our efforts at\nhome, we’d never get to the key issues of substance.\nI’d been making that point to the Americans for weeks. At first, I tried to\npersuade them to hold the talks at Camp David, ensuring the same, media-free\nisolation that had yielded the historic Israeli-Egypt agreement. But Dennis Ross\nreplied that the very association of Camp David with that breakthrough meant it\nwould be a non-starter for President Assad. I then suggested we consider sites\noutside of the US: NATO’s Incerlik air base in Turkey, for instance, a British base\nin Cyprus, an American naval ship in the Mediterranean. Even, half-jokingly, an\nabandoned missile silo in South Dakota. Yet the point I was making was serious, in\nfact critical, I believed, if the talks were going to have a chance.\nIn the end, the Americans settled on a beautiful, and undeniably remote, town in\nWest Virginia called Shepherdstown. But from the outset, I was worried it couldn’t\nprovide the kind of environment we needed. As soon as our plane landed at\nAndrews Air Force base outside Washington, I got a call from the head of our\nadvance team. He told me the news media were already there and that reporters –\nIsraeli, Arab, American and European – could be seen chatting with American,\nIsraeli and Syrian officials in the town’s coffee shops. I knew the press would have\nto publish something about potential concessions as the negotiations proceeded.\n332\n/ BARAK / 47\nWhether the stories were true wouldn’t matter. They would still make the real\nbargaining necessary for peace far more difficult, perhaps even impossible.\nI also had doubts whether Assad was ready for real peace: embassies, open\nborders, personal contact between Syrians and Israelis, and ideally an\ninternationally backed free-trade manufacturing area on the Golan to give Syria a\ntangible stake in ensuring the peace lasted. In earlier talks, under Shimon Peres,\nSyrian negotiators had at one stage brought a message from Assad. What did we\nmean, he wanted to know, with all this emphasis on peace, peace, peace? Syria had\npeace with El Salvador, but without any of the trappings we were insisting on.\nPeace, in Assad’s mind, seemed to mean merely an absence of war. Plus, of course,\ngetting back the Golan.\nI did, however, come ready to negotiate. Though I was still not prepared to\nreconfirm Rabin’s “pocket deposit” as a mere ticket of admission, my position\nremained essentially the one I had worked out with Yitzhak in formulating the\ndeposit: IAMNAM, “if all my needs are met.” Meaning that if Assad showed a\nreadiness to deal with Israel’s requirements in a peace deal, I did, of course,\nrecognize we would leave the Golan Heights. In addition to early-warning\nfacilities, we envisaged an open border with a demilitarized area on either side, as\nwell as guarantees that important sources of water for Israel would not be blocked\nor diverted. As Assad knew, despite his presumably feigned puzzlement about\nSyria’s arrangements with El Salvador, we also needed the agreement to embody a\nmutual commitment to real peace: through elements like an exchange of\nambassadors and the establishment of the free-trade zone. As with the Begin-Sadat\npeace, we assumed that our Golan withdrawal would come in phases, parallel to\nthe implementation of the other provisions of the treaty.\nIn our initial meetings in Shepherdstown, Foreign Minister al-Sharaa showed no\ninclination even to talk about these other issues. So on the second afternoon we\nwere there, I suggested to President Clinton the Americans try to break the logjam\nby drafting a paper of their own. It would detail all the issues in an eventual\nagreement, with parenthetical references to those on which we and the Syrians still\ndiffered. Then each side could respond with a view toward narrowing the gaps.\nThe President liked the idea. So did Al-Sharaa. Three days later, the President\npresented the eight-page American draft. With his customary eloquence, he\nemphasized the need for us to use it as a springboard for peace, not to score\npolitical points, and each side agreed to take a couple of days to look through it. It\n333\n/ BARAK / 48\nseemed to me we might finally be on a path to substantive negotiations. There was\nobviously not going to be a deal at this round of talks, but I agreed with President\nClinton that when they ended, he could phone Assad and tell him that I had\nconfirmed Rabin’s “pocket deposit.”\nYet by the time we left for home, the prospects suddenly looked much worse –\nfor the reason I’d feared from the moment we arrived. There were two major leaks.\nThe first came in an Arabic-language newspaper in London. Given the thrust of the\nstory, it had presumably come from the Syrians. But it was more annoying than\ntruly damaging. The second leak, however, was in the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz,\nwhich published the entire US negotiating paper. This was unwelcome for us, since\nit confirmed we were ready to go far in return for peace. But for the Syrians, the\nfact the final-border section was still a work-in-progress, with the parentheses to\nprove it, created the impression that they’d decided to negotiate the details of a full\npeace without first nailing down the return of the Golan Heights. Assad’s image as\na strongman, implacably tough on Israel, had been built and burnished over his\nthree decades in power. The embarrassment of being seen as amenable to talking\nabout a Syrian embassy in Israel without an agreement on the Golan struck me as a\npotentially fatal blow to the prospects for a deal, since it dramatically narrowed the\nscope for the flexibility needed by both sides to negotiate. I can’t say I was\nsurprised when Clinton phoned me when we got back to Israel to say that Assad\nhad refused to send Al-Sharaa back, as planned, for a further round of talks in 10\ndays’ time.\nI didn’t give up, however, and neither did President Clinton. In February, at the\nAmericans’ request, I sat down with Danny Yatom and US Ambassador Martin\nIndyk in Jerusalem to draw up a “bottom line” proposal on a withdrawal from the\nGolan Heights. Since I’d already empowered Clinton to reaffirm the “pocket\ndeposit”, I saw no reason not to do this. If only because of Assad’s failing health, I\nbelieved it was the only way we could know whether an agreement was possible.\nWe worked on a large satellite map of the Golan and the valley below, and drew\nour proposed border in red. We marked out a strip of several hundred meters on the\nfar side of the Sea of Galilee. It included, or came near to, a handful of Syrian\nvillages that had been there before 1967. But we were careful to adjust the line to\nexclude any area where buildings had stood. We compensated – with slightly more\nterritory – by bending the border westward to give the Syrians part of the slope\noverlooking the lake, in what was now Israel. We also included the hot springs at\n334\n/ BARAK / 49\nal-Hama, which I knew Assad had said he considered rightfully Syrian during talks\nheld under Rabin.\nBut the details turned out not to matter. President Clinton agreed to present the\nmap to Assad in what we both hoped would be a step to reopening the path for\npeace. The two of them met in Geneva in late March. Though the President also\ncame with full details of our positions on the other negotiating issues, he began by\ntelling Assad that I had agreed to the Syrians’ longstanding point of principle on\nour future border: it would be “based on the June 4, 1967 line” before the Six-Day\nWar. Then, the President unfurled the map.\nIt was shortly after five in the afternoon in Israel when Clinton phoned me. He\nsounded as if he’d been punched in the stomach. “Ehud, it’s not going to work,” he\nsaid. “The moment I started, he tuned out. He just said: ‘Do I get my land?’ I tried\nto get him to listen, but he just kept repeating: ‘Do I get all my land?’ According\nthe President, Assad would countenance nothing less than being able to sit on the\nshore of the Sea of Galilee and “dip his feet in the water.” Clinton said he’d done\nhis best, and that was true. “I understand the effort is over,” I replied. “Probably,\nhe’s too frail and ill by now.” In fact, Assad would die of leukemia barely two\nmonths later. His immediate focus was on ensuring an uncontested succession to\nhis son, Bashar.\nWhen Dennis Ross came to see me in Jerusalem, I think he expected to find me\nmore distraught than I felt. Of course, I was disappointed. But I told him I was\ngrateful that Clinton had stayed with a negotiating effort that had been frustrating\nfor all of us. When I became Prime Minister, I’d assured the Americans that as\nlong as our vital security interests were protected, I was ready to go further than\nany previous Israeli leader to get peace with Syria, and with Arafat too. I might\nfail, but it would not be for lack of trying. I believed that even a “failure” would\ntell us something: whether the other side was truly ready for peace. With Syria, I\ntold Dennis, “It’s not what we hoped for. But at least now we know.”\n* * *\n335\n/ BARAK / 50\nMy own negotiating team, not to mention the Americans, assumed I would now\nturn my attention to the Palestinians. Arafat was pressing for us to go ahead with\nphase-two of the Wye redeployments. In fact, he now wanted us to add the transfer\nof three Arab villages on the edge of east Jerusalem: Eizaria, El-Ram and, most\nimportantly, Abu Dis, since from there you could see the golden dome of the\nmosque above the Western Wall in the Old City. I understood why the villages\nwere politically important for him. But in practical terms, I also knew I’d have to\nsecure the support of the cabinet and the Knesset for what the Likud, and the main\nreligious parties too, would interpret as a first step toward “handing back\nJerusalem.”\nFor me, this underscored the problem at the heart of Oslo. We were transferring\nland to Arafat, yet still without any serious engagement from the Palestinians on\nthe “permanent-status” questions, like the furture of Jerusalem, that were critical to\nthe prospects for real peace. They were critical, in fact, even to reaching a\nframework agreement, or a declaration of principles, as a basis for a final treaty. I\nprobably should have seen the crisis-ridden spring of 2000 as a harbinger of the\ndifficulties when we finally got to that stage. I did make a first major effort to find\ncompromise ground on the main issues. I sent Gilead Sher and Shlomo Ben-Ami to\nbegin back-channel talks with a Palestinian team led by Abu Ala’a and Hassan\nAsfour, the architects of Oslo. But as I prepared to seek Knesset approval for\nreturning the three additional villages to the Palestinians, my main Orthodox\ncoalition partners, Shas and the National Religious Party, as well as Sharansky’s\nYisrael ba’Aliyah, all threatened to walk out of the government. I did manage to\nkeep them on board, but only by getting the Knesset vote classified as a noconfidence\nmotion. That meant that if we lost, the government would fall and there\nwould be new elections. That was something none of them wanted. They feared\nthat Arik and the Likud would do better this time around, and they would end up\nwith fewer seats.\nStill, even that didn’t avert a different kind of crisis. The vote was on May 15.\nFor the Palestinians, this was also Al-Naqba Day, the annual marking of the 1948\n“catastrophe” of the founding of the State of Israel. Danny Yatom told me the night\nbefore there were intelligence reports of large protests planned for the West Bank\nand in Gaza. President Clinton immediately got the American consul to deliver a\nmessage to Arafat, saying that the President expected him to intervene against any\nsign of violence. But Arafat’s reply was that, while he’d do what he could, he\n336\n/ BARAK / 51\ncouldn’t guarantee anything. In the months ahead I would come to understand what\nthat meant, because it would happen again. I don’t think Arafat himself\norchestrated the violence. Maybe he couldn’t have stopped it completely. But I\nhave no doubt – nor did President Clinton – that he stood aside and let it happen.\nEven worse – since he did have control over them – his security forces, with\narms that Israel had provided as part of Oslo, fired on our troops as they tried to\nkeep order. All of this, while I stood in the Knesset battling to get approval to give\nhim the villages. As news arrived in the chamber of gunfire just a couple of miles\naway, it was not just Likud or other right-wing MKs who were furious. I certainly\nwas. Yet I also knew that the price of losing the vote would be the fall of the\ngovernment. We did win the vote, by a margin of eight, meaning that I now had\nfull authority to return the three villages. Fuming over what had happened,\nhowever, I called President Clinton and told him I was going to delay the\nhandover. I was not about to return the villages under gunfire, or reward Arafat for\nbreaking even his existing security commitments.\nThat meant that prospects for serious negotiations with the Palestinians were\nagain on hold. But another, immutable, priority would probably have delayed any\nnew initiative anyway: my pledge to get our soldiers out of Lebanon within a year\nof the election. I was determined to go ahead with it not just because I’d promised\nIsraelis to do so. It was because I knew from experience that without setting a\ndeadline and sticking to it, it wouldn’t happen. I had been against keeping the\nsecurity zone from the start. Over the years, many Israelis, both inside the military\nand beyond, had come to accept we would be better off pulling out. It wasn’t just\nthe attritional loss of Israeli soldiers’ lives, but the fact that there was no obvious\npoint, and no obvious end, to our mission there. Especially when major tragedies\noccurred – like the collision of two Israeli helicopters a couple of years earlier,\nleaving scores of young soldiers dead – there was talk about a withdrawal. Yet\nthere was always a reason to reconsider, to put it off: a Hizbollah attack in the\nsecurity zone, accusations of weakness from right-wing politicians, or simple\ncaution in the kirya. The only way to get it done was to decide, and to do it.\nMy self-imposed deadline for the pullout was now just eight weeks away.\nHizbollah had already begun escalating pressure on our outposts in south Lebanon\nwith the obvious aim of making the withdrawal as difficult as possible. They were\nalso targeting our local surrogates, the Maronite-led South Lebanese Army militia.\nI’d been meeting regularly with Shaul Mofaz, the former paratroop officer who\n337\n/ BARAK / 52\nwas now chief of staff, to ensure we had a plan to get our troops out as quickly and\nsafely as possible once the order was given. But complex though the operational\nissues were, that was not the most difficult part. The withdrawal had not just a\nmilitary aim, but a critical political one: to denude Hizbollah, with full\ninternational support, of its “occupation” fig-leaf for targeting and terrorizing the\ntowns and villages of northern Israel. Shaul and a number of other generals in the\nkirya tried to make the security argument for keeping several small hilltop outposts\njust north of the border. But I insisted not a single Israeli soldier or emplacement\nremain on Lebanese soil. Throughout the spring, we had been coordinating every\ndetail of the planned pullout with UN cartographers on the ground, to ensure that\nthey, too, recognized it would be a full withdrawal to the border, fulfilling the\nterms of the Security Council resolution adopted after the 1982 Lebanon War.\nOrdinarily, an operation on this scale would have been carried out over a period\nof weeks. But when we handed over a pair of military strongholds to the South\nLebanon Army, and Hizbollah promptly moved in to take them over, it was clear\nthat even several days might risk chaos, and casualties, as we left. The head of the\nnorthern command now supported an immediate withdrawal, and I agreed.\nFrustratingly, we did have to hold off for a further 36 hours, in order to ensure the\nUN staff on the ground could complete their verification process. But on the\nafternoon of May 23, alongside Shaul Mofaz at a command post on the border, I\nordered the pullout of all Israeli troops, vehicles and other equipment within the\nspace of 24 hours. I then flew back to Jerusalem for an urgent meeting to secure\nformal cabinet approval. The field commanders ended up getting it done in less\nthan 24 hours, mostly overnight, without a single Israeli casualty. For nearly two\ndecades, our troops had been serving and dying on a strip of land on which we had\nno claim, no settlements, and for which there was no rational security need.\nFinally, we were out.\nAs I should have anticipated, there were accusations from Hizbollah and its\nallies that our UN-verified withdrawal was incomplete. At issue was a cluster of\nvillages where Lebanon meets Syria, known as the Sheba’a Farms. But as I knew\nfirst-hand, they were not part of Lebanon. I’d met their Syrian inhabitants when I\nhelped “capture” the villages at the very end of the 1973 war on the Golan. When\nSyria now publicly supported Hizbollah’s efforts to get the UN to say the area was\nin fact part of Lebanon, I decided to call their bluff. Through the Americans, I\n338\n/ BARAK / 53\nsuggested that Damascus confirm in writing that this part of the Golan was indeed\nLebanese. The Syrians never responded.\nEqually predictable were the prophets of doom on the Israeli right, who said the\nLebanon withdrawal would bury northern Israel in Katyushas and in blood. The\nreality was that in the half-dozen years following the pullout, the Israel-Lebanon\nborder was quieter than at any time since the late 1960s. The main personal impact\nof the withdrawal, however, was to remind me of why I’d run for Prime Minister in\nthe first place. Despite the challenges, and inevitable setbacks and frustrations, of\nmy first year in office, I was in a position to act on what I believed to be critical\nissues for my country’s future. On Lebanon, I’d succeeded, mainly because the\nwithdrawal was something we could do unilaterally. With Syria, I’d tried hard to\nget an agreement, only to find that Assad was unwilling, unable, or perhaps too ill\nto join in the search for a deal.\nI still recognized, however, that no issue was more important to Israel’s future\nthan our conflict with the Palestinians. I knew that resolving it would be even\ntougher than the talks with the Syrians. But the only way to find out whether peace\nwas possible was to try. So on the final day of May 2000, with the Lebanon pullout\ncomplete, I flew to Portugal – the site of a US-European summit – to see President\nClinton.\n339\n/ BARAK / 54\nChapter Twenty-One\nPresident Clinton and I met the next morning. My aim was to persuade him that\nthe time had come for a make-or-break summit with Yasir Arafat.\nI suspected it would not be easy to convince him, and it wasn’t. But I made the\nargument that if we were to have any hope of moving Oslo forward, we now faced\na stark choice. We were three years behind the timeline for starting work on a\n“permanent status” agreement, and only six months from an American election that\nwould choose President Clinton’s successor. We could, of course, pursue the Oslo\nprocess along its current, meandering path. But even though Bibi had slowed it\ndown, that would inevitably mean Israel handing back yet more West Bank land to\nArafat – in return for familiar, but still unfulfilled and untested, verbal assurances\nthat he wanted peace. Each successive Israeli withdrawal reduced his incentive to\nengage of the core issues like final borders, refugees, or Jerusalem. I could not in\ngood conscience justify that, either to myself or my country. The second option\nwas the summit. I realized there was no guarantee it would succeed. But it would\nfinally force Arafat to negotiate on the core issues – before the departure of an\nAmerican President who had a grasp of the all issues and characters involved, and\na personal commitment to converting the promise of Oslo into a genuine peace.\nThe obvious political risk, for both Clinton and me, was that after convening a\nsummit – with all the heightened expectations and pressures it would bring – we’d\nfail to get an agreement. Though I’d be more directly affected, however, it was a\nmore straightforward choice for me. In part because I’d been in front-line politics\nso briefly, but mostly because of what I’d done for the three-and-a-half decades\nbefore then, I viewed the political risk as just one of many, and by no means the\nmost important. That was an obvious weakness in me as a traditional politician. I\nwould indeed pay a political price later on for having given too little heed, and\nperhaps underestimated, the reaction in Israel to the summit and what came after it.\nYet as I tried to impress on President Clinton, there were risks in not holding a\nsummit as well, along with the obvious reward of a full and final peace if it\nsucceeded. If it failed? At least we would know a peace agreement with Arafat was\nimpossible. In fact, amid the diplomatic drift since Oslo, it was clear there was no\nother way that we could know.\n340\n/ BARAK / 55\nWalking with the President in Lisbon’s spring sunshine, I tried to summon up\nan image that would bring both of us back to the starkly different reality of our\nconflict with the Palestinians. Only two weeks earlier, Arafat’s own police force,\nwith weapons we had given them, had opened fire as I was trying to get Knesset\napproval for returning three villages that he wanted. After I took office, I’d ordered\na full-scale intelligence review of the security situation with the Palestinians. The\nsobering conclusion had been delivered to me six months earlier: plans were well\nunderway by cells in the West Bank and Gaza for armed attacks against Israeli\nsoldiers and terror strikes inside Israel. “It’s like two families living in the same\nhouse, and it’s on fire,” I said. “All of us are rushing to put it out. But there’s this\nveteran firefighter who arrives on the scene – a firefighter with a Nobel Peace\nPrize – and we have no way of knowing whether he’s got matches and gasoline in\nhis pocket.” We had to find that out, I said. We had to establish whether we were\nall firefighters, and could put out the flames.\nClinton and I had got to know each other well. In one-on-one conversations like\nthis, we called each other by our first names, though I was careful to address him\nas “Mr President” when others were there. We’d been through a lot together. I had\nno doubt that he wanted to put out the fire every bit as much as I did. But I also\nrealized he had emerged frustrated, and bruised, from our last joint effort at\npeacemaking: with Hafez al-Assad. I was the one who had been pushing the\nhardest for him to meet Assad in Geneva, over the objections of some of his closest\naides that it was likely to go wrong. Not only were the aides right. Assad had\nended up delivering an extraordinary personal rebuff to the President of the United\nStates. Now, I was again asking President Clinton for a summit, and I knew\nMadeleine Albright, Dennis Ross and others would be highly sceptical. “I\nunderstand they’ll have doubts. I understand their reading of the risks,” I told\nPresident Clinton. “But I’m convinced crucial issues are at stake, which justify the\nrisks. Let’s move forward.”\nBut Clinton was skeptical, too. He said that without some sign of diplomatic\nprogress between us and the Palestinians, he could see no way of holding a\nsummit. With Arafat due to see him in Washington in a couple of weeks, he said\nthat I first had to give the Palestinian leader something: the three villages, a\nprisoner release, or perhaps unfreeze tax revenues which we’d been holding back\nas leverage for at least some progress on the core issues. Otherwise, Clinton said\nhe was certain Arafat would refuse to attend a summit. And even if he said yes,\n341\n/ BARAK / 56\nClinton felt we would need a draft document with broad areas of agreement before\na diplomatic “endgame” could begin. I disagreed on that. I argued that if we tried\nto produce such a document, there would never be a summit. In fact, we’d never\nget a draft document worth anything. “Neither side is going to commit itself on\nissues like borders, refugees, or Jerusalem,” I said, pointing out that even in our\nback-channel talks, the only forum in which there had been a hint of progress,\nthose issues had barely been touched.\nHe did accept that “pre-negotiation” would never crack the main issues. But he\nstill said that before he could contemplate a summit, he would need Madeleine\nAlbright and Dennis Ross to talk in detail with us and the Palestinians. “There had\nto be a firm basis to work on,” he said. Even then,m he said, he was almost sure\nArafat would resist the idea of a summit. And on that last point, he proved right. I\nspoke to the President by phone after Arafat’s trip to Washington. “He thinks\nyou’re trying to trap him into a summit, and that when it fails, I’ll blame him,” he\ntold me.\nThe very next day, the stakes increased dramatically. For months, military\nintelligence had been warning of the potential for violence if we couldn’t find a\nlong-term political resolution of the Palestinian conflict. But the report which\nlanded on my desk on June 16, 2000 was more specific. It said Arafat had called in\nhis security people and said: “My strategic understanding is that Israel is not\ninterested in reaching a deal. Therefore, we are preparing ourselves for a violent\nand prolonged confrontation.” A few days later, we got an even more worrying\nreport, saying the security officers had been told to begin “intensive training.”\nArafat was quoted as saying: “The Palestinian Authority is confronted by a strong\nand dangerous Israel, headed by a Prime Minister who is not interested in real\npeace. The proof of that is that when he was Chief of Staff, he was the only senior\nofficer to oppose the Oslo Agreement.” I summoned my security team: Mofaz as\nchief of staff; the heads of military intelligence, Mossad and the Shin Bet. I told\nthem that Arafat was wrong. My inalterable “red line” would always be Israel’s\nnational and security interests. But as long as those were protected, I wasn’t just\ninterested in reaching an agreement with the Palestinians. I was determined to do\neverything possible to try to get one. But I also said that we had to make sure we\nwere fully prepared for responding to “Palestinian violence and, at some stage,\nfull-blown terror.”\n342\n/ BARAK / 57\n* * *\nA few days later, the “pre-endgame” around the summit began. Not in\nWashington or Jerusalem or Ramallah or Gaza, but in Kochav Yair. Nava and I\nstill spent almost all our weekends there. We valued the quiet, or at least the\nslightly quieter, time away from Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. Some of my oldest army\nfriends lived there as well: Danny Yatom, as well as Shaul Mofaz and Uzi Dayan,\nwho was now deputy chief of staff. Newer colleagues, too, like Yossi Ginossar, a\nShin Bet veteran who spoke fluent Arabic and, after working in the West Bank and\nGaza in the late 1960s became one of the first Israelis to hold secret talks with\nArafat, building up a personal relationship with him. Under both Rabin and Peres,\nhe had been a valuable liaison with the Palestinian leader. Nowm under my\nPremiership as well.\nThe summit seemed to me more important than ever, but I knew that only\nPresident Clinton could make it happen. Short of giving the Palestinians the whole\nlist of short-term rewards they wanted, including the three villages, I knew Arafat\nwas never going to be enthusiastic. But if Clinton was persuaded that a peace\nagreement was within reach, I had confidence he would make the effort. I had\nallowed Gili Sher and Shlomo Ben-Ami to go to Washington the week before for\nexploratory talks with Dennis Ross. Shlomo, as I knew he’d done in the backchannel\ntalks with the Palestinians, had gone beyond anything that I would or\ncould say at this stage in order to probe the edges of where an eventual\ncompromise might be possible. Now Clinton had sent Dennis to Israel, with\nMadeleine Albright to follow at the end of the month, and I had to assume that\ntheir impressions would be critical to his decision on whether to bring me and\nArafat to Camp David.\nWe agreed to meet Dennis and his team at Danny’s house in Kochav Yair. By\nthe time I’d made the pleasant Shabbat-afternoon stroll from our house, a few\nstreets away, they were in the back garden sipping lemonade and munching on\npopcorn. I’d met often with Dennis during my year as Prime Minister, and I liked\nhim. He was smart, knowledgeable and experienced. He’d worked under three US\nPresidents: Carter, Bush Senior and now Clinton. No American diplomat had been\nmore indefatigably involved in the search for Middle East peace. And whatever his\noccasional frustrations, he also recognized I was ready to go further than any\n343\n/ BARAK / 58\nprevious Israeli leader in trying to get that peace.\nI knew that he would press me to tell him how far that actually was. He didn’t\nask directly. But each of his ostensibly theoretical questions was aimed at\nestablishing whether I could give him enough for a summit to bridge the gaps on\nkey issues. Could I accept a “trade-off between sovereignty and time?”\nTranslation: could I give the Palestinians sovereignty over a larger part of the West\nBank if we signed an agreement that would phase in their control? Could I accept\nthe principle of land swaps? This meant giving Arafat land in areas bordering the\nWest Bank, or in the Negev near Gaza, to compensate, at least partially, for the\narea we would keep for the major settlement blocs. What about applying my\nprinciple of “disengagement” between Israel and the Palestinians to Jerusalem?\nMeaning Arafat getting control of the predominantly Arab neighborhoods in the\neast of the city.\nDennis knew my long-standing reluctance to commit to concessions until we\ngot to real, final negotiations with Arafat. “We’ll not reveal anything you tell us,”\nhe assured me. “We won’t turn what you say into opening negotiating positions for\nArafat. But if there is going to be a summit, the President wanted some answers.”\nTo Dennis’s frustration, however, I could give him no specifics, beyond telling\nhim: “You know me, Dennis. You know I’m serious about this. Of course, we will\nprotect our vital security and national interests. But the problem in making peace\nwon’t be us, on the Israeli side, as long as Arafat shows a capacity and a will for\ndecision.” The translation of that, as I hoped and trusted he understood was that if\nand when Arafat demonstrated that he wanted a comprehensive peace between a\nnew Palestinian state and the State of Israel – a definitive “end of conflict” as the\ninternational lawyers would describe it – I would place nothing, except our security\nand core national interests, in the way of getting an agreement.\nMadeleine Albright visited at the end of June. When she came to see me a day\nafter meeting Arafat, she carried a request from the Palestinian leader: two weeks\nof “preparatory” talks before a summit. Again, I knew her mission was to bring\nback enough progress for the President to feel a summit was worth it. But again, I\ncouldn’t give her what she wanted. “I know what will happen in preparatory talks,”\nI said. “We’ll raise new ideas, which the Palestinians will reject, and ask for\nmore.” I don’t know what she told Clinton, or Arafat. But Dennis called me the\nfollowing day. He said that Arafat had agreed to attend a summit, and would leave\nthe date up to the President.\n344\n/ BARAK / 59\nWhen Clinton phoned me at the beginning of July, however, he still hadn’t\nfinally decided to hold the summit. I needed him to know that, on my side, he’d\nhave a truly willing partner, aware of the political risk he’d be taking. Like Dennis,\nthe President tried to probe my position on land swaps, and Palestinian sovereignty\nfor at least some Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem. Finally, he asked if I would\nrule out those possibilities if they represented the difference between success or\nfailure at a summit. I did not give him a definitive “yes.” I said we could think\nthrough those issues together. But when he phoned again, on July 4 from Camp\nDavid, I felt I had to go further. I said that, for his ears only, I was willing to give\nhim the assurance that, assuming that Arafat was willing to move toward us on\ncore issues, I would consider limited, symbolic moves on both land swaps and\nPalestinian sovereignty in part of East Jerusalem.\nClinton replied: the summit was on. It would begin at Camp David in one\nweek’s time, on July 11.\n* * *\nTwo days before leaving for the US, I brought my ministers together. “We can’t\nknow what will happen at a summit,” I said. “But we have a responsibility to give\nit a chance, and recognize the situation in which we find ourselves. If we sit idle\nand don’t even try, we’ll face an eruption of violence, and never know whether we\ncould have avoided it. If, God forbid, we fail to reach an agreement, there will also\nbe violence. We will face a new reality more difficult than you can imagine. But if\nwe do manage the strike a deal, we are going to change the map and history of the\nMiddle East.” I reminded them it would be up to Israelis to say yes or no, in a\nreferendum, to the terms of any agreement we negotiated. “If we achieve a\nbreakthrough, I’m confident they will do so, by a landslide.”\nI said I would hold fast to a number of principles. There would be “no return to\nthe 1967 lines,” meaning that we would draw a new border with the West Bank to\naccommodate the largest settlement blocs. They were mostly around Jerusalem, or\njust beyond the 1967 border. In practical terms, over the years they had become\npart of Israel. Tens of thousands of people lived there. As the Americans and even\nthe Palestinian negotiators recognized, no Israeli government, Labor or Likud,\n345\n/ BARAK / 60\nwould agree to make them part of a Palestinian state. The second principle was that\n“Jerusalem will remain united.” It would not be cut into Jewish and Arab halves as\nhad happened between 1948 and 1967. That, I knew, might prove tougher to carry\nthrough on. But even if I had to concede a degree of Palestinian control in parts of\neast Jerusalem, I expected to be able to retain Israeli sovereignty over the city. The\nthird principle was that there would be “no foreign army west of the Jordan River.”\nIn other words, if we did hand back at least the major part of the West Bank, it\nwould be demilitarized and we would have security control over the Jordan Valley.\nFinally, we would not “accept responsibility for the birth of the refugee problem\nand its solution.” Though there could be a “right of return” into a new Palestinian\nstate, we would not agree to rewrite the history of the 1948 war by sanctioning the\nresettlement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians inside the State of Israel.\nI think it was the very fact we were talking about a comprehensive peace\nagreement that made it so hard for my Orthodox and right-of-center coalition\npartners. They didn’t see the attraction of coming to final terms of peace. They\nknew it would mean concessions. There would be a Palestinian state. We would\ngive up the great majority of Biblical Judaea and Samaria. While most of the\nsettlers would remain, since they lived in the major blocs, those in more isolated\nsettlements around the West Bank would have to be moved. They saw the prospect\nof a final peace only in terms of what we were giving up. They didn’t see what we\nwould gain: not just peace, and international recognition and endorsement for it.\nBut normalcy: the central aim of Zionism. Jews living in a state like any other.\nEver since 1967, we had been in control of the daily lives of hundreds of thousands\nof Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza. That was bad for them. But it had\nbeen bad for us too. Fifty-two years after the birth of our state, we still didn’t have\na permanent, internationally recognized border. Rather than dealing with our\neconomic and social issues like other states, we were beset by internal divisions\nthat were in no small part a result of our unresolved conflict with the Palestinians.\nShas, the National Religious Party and Sharansky’s Yisrael ba’Aliyah were all\nthreatening to pull out of the government because of the summit. Nothing I said\ncould change their minds. Sharansky was the first to declare he was leaving. A few\nhours later, Shas and the NRP followed suit. If the Likud mustered the required 61\nvotes for the no-confidence motion it was introducing before I got on the plane to\nthe US, the government would fall. If the parties that had left the coalition, with a\ntotal of 28 seats, went along with Arik Sharon, it wouldn’t be close. As if that\n346\n/ BARAK / 61\nwasn’t enough, David Levy, my Foreign Minister, told me he would not be joining\nme at Camp David. He wasn’t resigning, at least not yet. But he knew that the final\ndecisions at the summit would be mine, he feared it would fail, and didn’t want to\nshare in the consequences.\nNone of this meant I wasn’t going. Even if the no-confidence vote succeeded,\nthe new Israeli electoral system, with its separate vote for Prime Minister, meant I\nwould remain in office, at least until the summit was over. In a nationally televised\nmessage, I reminded the country that I’d been elected with nearly two million\nvotes. I felt I had a responsibility, and a mandate, that went beyond party politics.\n“I must rise above the political arguments, and seek out all possibilities on the way\nto a peace agreement that will end the conflict, and the blood, between us and our\nneighbors.” I made the same points before the Knesset. I did, of course, want\nparliamentary support. But I was acting on a mandate from the people of Israel. It\nwas they, in a referendum, who would ultimately decide on anything we might\nagree. When the Knesset votes were counted, thanks to the fact two dozen MKs\nabstained, both sides lost. Arik fell seven votes short of a majority. So the\ngovernment survived. But those opposed to the summit got more votes than we\ndid: 54 to 52.\nThere were several consolations as I prepared to fly out from Ben-Gurion\nairport. Shas leader Eli Yishai passed me an envelope on the tarmac. Inside was a\nnote from Rabbi Ovadia Yossef, the Shas spiritual leader whom I’d met with\nprivately after the election and a number of times since. He wanted to wish me\ngood luck. Nearly 30 reserve generals also issued a public message of support.\nPerhaps most encouragingly, a newspaper poll found a majority of Israelis – 55\npercent to 45 – believed I was right to go to Camp David and that I had a mandate\nto make concessions in return for peace.\nDavid Levy came over to talk before I boarded. “I doubt we’ll get an\nagreement,” he said. I told him what I was telling other ministers, what I’d told\nreporters and, in fact what I had told Nava. “The odds are fifty-fifty.” The reporters\ntook this as coy, or deliberately deceptive. So I added that it was not because I\nknew something they didn’t. “It’s because there are two possible outcomes, and I\ndon’t know which one will happen.” The gaps of substance were bridgeable. The\nquestion was whether both sides wanted peace, and whether each had made a\nserious, strategic decision to go for it. I’d made that choice. But I had no way of\nknowing whether Yasir Arafat had.\n347\n/ BARAK / 62\nI was confident of finally answering that question at the summit. Camp David\nwas different from Shepherdstown. No reporters would be there. Mobile phones\nwere banned. Each delegation had one landline. We’d also be operating under a\ntime constraint. President Clinton was due to leave for a G8 summit in Japan on\nJuly 19. The gave us barely a week. I did wonder whether that would be enough,\neven if both sides were committed to reaching a peace agreement. Yet I hoped it\nwould at least provide the possibility, as it had for Begin and Sadat twenty-two\nyears earlier, to reach a framework agreement that open the door to a final peace\ntreaty.\nNot just the time, but the numbers were limited. We and the Palestinians could\nhave only a dozen members in our negotiating teams. Some of my choices were\nautomatic: Danny Yatom; Shlomo Ben-Ami, whom I’d made acting Foreign\nMinister in Levy’s absence; Amnon Lipkin and Attorney-General Elyakim\nRubinstein; Gilead Sher and his chief negotiating aide, Gidi Grinstein. I also took\nalong a strong security team, including Shlomo Yanai, head of strategic planning\nthe kirya, and Israel Hason, a former deputy-head of Shin Bet. There was another\nimportant, if less obvious, inclusion: Dan Meridor. A leading member of the Likud\nbefore he’d formed the Center Party at the last election, Dan was not just a friend.\nHe was a man of rock-solid integrity, with a strong moral and ethical compass,\nwho put principle over party. He was also a lawyer, and had been Minister of\nJustice under Bibi. Along with Attorney-General Rubinstein, I knew I’d have a\ngifted legal team if we got to the point of considering the specifics of a peace\nagreement. There was another consideration as well. Both Dan and Elyakim were\nright-of-center politically. I felt I needed their voices as a kind of litmus for the\ntough decisions, and concessions, I might have to consider if an agreement did\nprove possible.\nI was not nervous as we crossed the Atlantic, though even those who knew me\nbest assumed I would be. Nava had sent me off with a list of dietary instructions,\nalmost like a surgeon general’s warning that Camp David might prove hazardous\nto my health. But I felt prepared. I’d gone to every source I could find about the\nBegin-Sadat summit. I knew there would be periods of crisis and that at certain\npoints I’d have to allow leeway for my own team to explore possible compromises\nbeyond our set negotiating limits. Yet none of this altered my belief that holding\nthe summit was the right thing to do, nor my confidence in being able to play my\npart. I did feel a huge responsibility. Decades after our conflict with the\n348\n/ BARAK / 63\nPalestinians had begun, seven years after Oslo, I was making an attempt, with the\nparticipation of the President of the United States, to shape the final terms of\npeace. I knew I carried the conflicting hopes and fears of Israelis with me.\nAnd the odds really were 50-50. Either we’d come home with an agreement, to\nbe placed before the country in a referendum. Or we would know that, at least for\nnow, it was beyond reach.\n349\n/ BARAK / 64\nChapter Twenty-Two\nIf I believed in omens, I might have turned back as soon as we got to the\nsummit. We reached Camp David a little before ten at night on July 10, after\nhelicoptering from Andrews Air Force base near Washington. When we arrived, it\nwas pouring with rain. The cabin assignments were also a surprise. I was given the\none that Anwar Sadat had at the first Camp David summit in 1978. Arafat got\nMenachem Begin’s. Still, the cabins themselves, each named for a tree, were large\nand pleasant. Mine was called Dogwood. It had a bedroom, two large sitting rooms\nand a terrace. I took it as a good omen that it was the same one where Nava and I\nhad stayed during our visit with the President Clinton and Hillary right after I’d\nbecome Prime Minister.\nWith just eight days to address the core issues of decades of conflict, we got\ndown to work the next morning. Clinton began by meeting Arafat, as I went\nthrough the Americans’ strategy for the negotiations with Madeleine Albright,\nDennis Ross and Martin Indyk. Then I met the President in his cabin, which was\ncalled Aspen. He told me that while Arafat still thought I was trying to “trick him”\ninto an agreement, and didn’t think we’d necessarily get a deal, he did accept I was\nserious about trying. My fear was still the opposite, that Arafat was not serious.\nYet my hope was that the isolated environment of Camp David, and the wide\npublic expectation that we would accomplish what Sadat and Begin had done there\nbefore, would deliver the breakthrough that I believed ought to be possible. For\nthat to happen, I told the President, I believed it was essential that Arafat truly\nunderstood the importance of what was at stake. Not just the cost of failure, but\nwhat was potentially on offer: the creation of the Palestinian state he sought, with\nthe full acceptance of Israel and the support of the world.\nI wish I could say I was optimistic when Clinton led the two of us into Laurel\nLodge, the larger cabin a few hundreds downhill from Aspen, for the opening\nsession of the summit. The scene at the front door – with me bustling Arafat ahead,\nwith the intention of allowing him to enter before me – yielded the best-known\nimage from the summit. Captured by the television crews allowed into the\ncompound for the ceremonial opening, it spawned a cottage industry of political\nspeculation and armchair psychoanalysis purporting to decipher what it meant.\nSome said it was an encouraging sign of “chemistry” between me and Arafat, a not\n350\n/ BARAK / 65\nunreasonable guess, since both of us were grinning throughout. Others concluded\nthat because each of us was trying to nudge the other to go in first, it was a sign of\nunderlying conflict: neither of us wanted to allow the other the privilege of\nappearing to be polite. Still others, bizarrely, said that it was an ornate Middle\nEastern power play, with the aim of demonstrating that I was ultimately in control\nof proceedings. In fact, it would turn out to be a singularly apt image of what\nhappened in the days that followed: a reluctant Arafat, an engaged and expectant\nPrime Minister of Israel, a smiling and hopeful Clinton.\nWe did begin on a note of optimism. In my opening statement, I said: “Now is\nthe time for us to make a peace of the brave, to find a way to live together side by\nside with mutual respect, and to create a better future for our children.” Arafat said\nhe hoped that the peace Begin and Sadat had made at Camp David would prove an\nauspicious example. “With the help of President Clinton, we could reach a deal\nthat is good for both sides.”\nBut it was going to take more than noble words. The details of a peace treaty, or\neven a framework agreement, were going to require negotiation. Both Arafat and I\narrived fully aware of the shape of the “hard decisions” I’d referred to months\nearlier when we met in Oslo. On his side, it would come down to whether he was\nprepared for a comprehensive, final peace. A true “end of conflict,” with no get-out\nclauses, no strings left untied, no further claims on either side. In concrete terms,\nthis would mean abandoning his claim for a notional hundreds of thousands of\nPalestinian refugees to resettle inside the pre-1967 borders of the State of Israel.\nAnd what were Israel’s difficult decisions? In return for the end of conflict, I\nwould have to deal away the maximum possible part of the West Bank, certainly\nwell above the 80 percent I’d quoted Shimon Peres as suggesting when I’d first\nmet with President Clinton. I would have to accept the idea of land swaps, if\nnecessary, in order to bring the overall percentage as near as possible to the\nequivalent of the whole of the West Bank. I would have to be flexible on the\narrangements to ensure Israeli security oversight over the Jordan Valley. And if a\ntrue peace was really on the table, both Arafat and I would have to consider some\nform of compromise on the most emotionally and symbolically difficult issue of\nall: the future governance of Jerusalem.\nOn the first evening, we met as an Israeli delegation to discuss our position for\nthe days ahead. Gili Sher and Danny Yatom helped me keep a clear overall picture\nof proceedings throughout the summit. Our secure landline was operated by a Shin\n351\n/ BARAK / 66\nBet technician. I assumed that, one way or another, the Americans could listen in,\nbut was fairly confident we were beyond the electronic earshot of the Palestinians.\nI kept myself fully informed of, but at a distance from, the specific work of our\nfive negotiating teams. Though I could not have stayed engaged with all of them at\nthe same time, I also hoped the arrangement would give them an opportunity to\nexplore any realistic opportunity for a breakthrough and any sign of flexibility on\nArafat’s side – without committing me until there was such flexibility.\nYet for the first couple of days of the summit, there was not only no sign of\nflexibility. There was little meaningful engagement. Dennis Ross and his team\ndrew up a paper setting out the main issues. For those on which we differed, our\npositions were marked with “I” and “P”. It wasn’t until around midnight on daytwo\nthat the we got a first look at the American draft. The main, unhappy, surprise\nwas Jerusalem. This crucial issue was not marked with “I” or “P”. It said outright\nthat there could be two capitals, one Israeli and one Palestinian, within the city of\nJerusalem. I was not opposed to the Palestinians calling Jerusalem the capital of\ntheir state. But even in follow-up talks after Oslo, when Yossi Beilin and Abu\nMazen had explored avenues toward a possible resolution of the Jerusalem\nquestion, the maximum understanding was that Israel might expand the existing\ncity limits to accommodate the “two capital” solution. The Palestinians’ capital\nwould be in Abu Dis, one of the villages Arafat had asked me to hand back in May.\nThe way the American document was worded suggested dividing Jerusalem as it\nnow was: something ruled out by all Israeli politicians, of all parties, ever since\n1967.\nWhen I phoned President Clinton, he asked me to come talk. We sat on the back\nterrace of his cabin, looking out incongruously on a beautifully tended golf hole\ninstalled by Dwight Eisenhower. I told the President that after all the hours we had\nspent together, I’d felt blindsided by the inclusion of a proposal on Jerusalem that\nwent beyond anything we’d talked about. “It was my mistake,” he replied,\nobviously already aware through his negotiators of the error. He said that he’d put\npressure on his negotiators to get the document finished, and that Dennis hadn’t\nhad time to read it through. But it was already being fixed: the word “expanded”\nwould be added to the Jerusalem section. I was grateful for that, but told Clinton I\nwas concerned that even this “I and P” paper might have the unintended effect of\ndelaying any real progress. “Since it’s an American document, it gives the\nPalestinians no incentive to compromise,” I said, suggesting that it might be better\n352\n/ BARAK / 67\nsimply to withdraw the paper. Clinton’s answer encouraged, and surprised, me.\n“We agree,” he said. “The paper no longer exists.” It soon turned out the\nPalestinians were unhappy with it too, but for another reason. On the lookout for\nvalidation of Arafat’s insistence that Camp David was an Israeli “trap”, they were\nconvinced that the paper had Israel’s fingerprints all over it. That wasn’t true. The\none change we’d insisted on was because it misrepresented our position on\nJerusalem. Still, since Dennis had added the word “expanded” to the Jerusalem\nsection in longhand, the Palestinians were convinced of Israel co-authorship.\nIn fact, three days into the summit, the mood among the Palestinians seemed\nincreasingly aggrieved. Not just the Americans, but some members of my own\nteam, were urging me to show more “personal warmth” towards Arafat. I did\nalways exchange greetings and pleasantries with him at mealtimes in Laurel\nLodge, but even there, I admit, that I didn’t exactly show enthusiasm, much less\nebullience. After one dinner, when I’d been placed between the Palestinian leader\nand Chelsea Clinton, the President’s National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger,\nasked me why, rather than talking to Arafat, I’d spent almost the entire time\nchatting with Chelsea. My response was only half-joking: “Given the choice, who\nwouldn’t?”\nIt wasn’t only that I believed a charm initiative would come over as contrived. I\ndidn’t want to risk misleading Arafat, the other Palestinians and possibly the\nAmericans as well, by giving them the impression I was satisfied with the progress\nof the summit, or felt that we were heading towards any serious engagement and\ncompromise on the core issues. I had met Arafat many times before Camp David. I\nhad made it clear in all of those meeting that, despite differences on a range of\ndifficult issues, I did want a final peace agreement and that I was ready to consider\nthe tough decisions necessary to make it possible. At Camp David, I was not\nagainst meeting Arafat as a matter of principle. I simply felt the time for such a\nmeeting, if it came, would be at the moment that we saw at least some signal of a\nreadiness on his part to negotiate seriously.\nStill, given the strength of feeling among some of my own negotiators, I felt a\nresponsibility to give it a try. I told Yossi Ginossar, the former Shin Bet officer\nwho was closest to the Palestinian leader among the Israelis, to set up an informal\nmeeting. I added, to Yossi’s obvious satisfaction and surprise, that I’d be willing to\nhave the meeting in Arafat’s cabin if that’s what he preferred. The next afternoon, I\nwent there for tea and baklava. Abu Mazen, his top political adviser and the main\n353\n/ BARAK / 68\nPalestinian architect of Oslo, was with him, along with a more junior aide who\nserved the tea and sweets. At least this time, Arafat didn’t take notes as we spoke.\nThe mood was friendly. We talked about a whole range of issues. With ony one\nexception: what was really happening, or what should happen, in the summit talks.\nI found the exercise disappointing as a result. But Yossi Ginossar assured me it\nwould help the atmosphere, and would eventually translate into negotiating\nprogress. “I hope so,” I said.\nIt wasn’t until day-four that real talks began. The Americans arranged for\nnegotiating teams from both sides on borders, the refugee issue, and Jerusalem to\nmeet with President Clinton. The Palestinians participated, but showed no sign at\nall of a readiness to compromise. Borders should have been the most\nstraightforward. Assuming we wanted a deal, it was about sitting down with a map\nand working out how to address both sides’ arguments. But Arafat’s representative\nin the meeting – the Oslo negotiator Abu Ala’a – said he wouldn’t even discuss\nborders without a prior agreement to land swaps ensuring Palestinian control over\nan area equivalent to 100 percent of the West Bank. Shlomo Ben-Ami did try to\nfind a way around this. He suggested the Palestinians assume that to be the case for\nthe purposes of the meeting, so that at least there could be meaningful discussion\nof the border, including the provisions Israel wanted in order to retain the major\nsettlement blocks. President Clinton agreed that made sense. He said that without\ntalking about the substance of such issues, there wasn’t going to be a deal. Even\nAbu Ala’a seemed receptive, according to Shlomo. But he insisted that he would\nhave to ask Arafat first whether it was okay.\nOn refugees, pretty much the same thing happened. The Americans, and I\nassumed at that point even the Palestinians, knew that a peace deal would be\nimpossible if we agreed to hundreds of thousands of refugees entering Israel – in\neffect leaving the state created in 1948 with a Jewish minority. But when President\nClinton began trying to narrow down details of a compromise resettlement package\n– how many refugees would return, where they would go, and how to arrange\ninternational financial support for them – Abu Mazen insisted that nothing could\nbe discussed until without a prior Israeli acceptance of the “principle of the right of\nreturn.” On Jerusalem, according to Gilead Sher, the President didn’t even try to\nfind common ground on the core issue: sovereignty. Instead he used the formula\nShlomo Ben-Ami had suggested, telling each side to proceed on the assumption\nsovereignty was decided in its favour, and to concentrate instead on how everyday\n354\n/ BARAK / 69\nmunicipal functions and daily life would be divided between Israel and the\nPalestinians under a peace agreement.\nWhen I convened our negotiators in my cabin to take stock of the logjam, I was\ngetting more and more skeptical of finding a way to get to actual negotiation on the\n“hard decisions” I assumed both sides knew we’d have to make. I told our team we\ncould not play that game. Until there was at least some movement from Arafat, I\ndidn’t want them suggesting any Israeli concessions. We’d obviously get nothing\nin return. The summit would fail. Despite my repeated insistence both to the\nAmericans and Palestinians that, without an agreement, any Israeli suggestions\nwould be null and void, that didn’t mean they would simply be forgotten. The\nresult is that we’d actually be in a worse situation than before Camp David.\nPolitically, I’d find myself in much the same position as President Assad, after the\nleak of the American draft from Shepherdstown: apparently ready to consider\ngiving Arafat the great majority of the West Bank, without the slightest sign Arafat\nwas ready for a full and final peace. But that wasn’t my main concern. It was that\nanything that we put on the table here would handcuff future Israeli governments if\nand when an “end of conflict” agreement became possible.\nStill, when Dennis Ross learned from my negotiators what I’d decided, he was\nfrustrated and upset. He came to see me on Saturday morning – day-five of what\nwas looking increasingly like a stillborn summit. “This summit was your idea,” he\nsaid, reminding me that the President had agreed to it over the reservations of a lot\nhis own aides. He told me that at a minimum, I had to help give it a chance: by\ngiving him my true negotiating “red lines.” Either that, or give my negotiators\nmore leeway to explore compromises. I did not want to make Dennis’s job any\nmore difficult than it already was. And I told him I was still ready to engage fully\nif we ever got to the real substance of a possible deal. “But I can’t do what you’ve\nasked me,” I replied. “Not when Arafat is simply holding firm and not showing a\nwillingness even to look for compromises.”\nFortunately for my relationship with the President – though not for the\nprospects of an agreement – Clinton had considerably more sympathy with my\nposition after his next meeting with both sets of negotiators that afternoon. It was a\nreturn encounter with Abu Ala’a on territory and borders. Shlomo Ben-Ami now\nproduced a map of the West Bank with our proposed breakdown into the areas that\nwould be controlled by a Palestinian state, the part Israel would retain to\naccommodate the major settlements, and territory which we suggested would go to\n355\n/ BARAK / 70\nthe Palestinians after a transitional period. The part we had earmarked for\nPalestinian control was now a bit over 85 percent of the West Bank, more than I’d\nindicated to the President in our first meeting a year earlier. But while Abu Ala’a\nhad told Clinton he would ask for Arafat’s permission at least to negotiate, he\nclearly hadn’t received it. He refused to talk about the map, or even respond to\nClinton’s suggestion that the Palestinians present a map of their own, until we did\ntwo things: accept the principle of land swaps and reduce the size of the territory\nwe were suggesting for the settlement blocs. To Shlomo’s, and I’m sure even more\nso to Abu Ala’a’s, astonishment, the President exploded. He told Abu Ala’a that to\nrefuse to provide any input or ideas was the very opposite of negotiation. It was an\n“outrageous” approach. He stormed out.\nIt was late that evening when the first move toward the “make-or-break”\nsituation I had hoped for seemed to occur, though still with much more likelihood\nof break than make. The President decided the only way to make progress was to\nsequester a pair of negotiators from each side overnight. Their task would be to\nsearch honesty for the outlines of a possible peace agreement. They were to update\nArafat and myself and then report to Clinton the next day. Then, we’d see where\nwe were. I agreed to send Shlomo and Gili Sher, my former “back-channel”\nnegotiators. I knew that whatever guidelines I gave them, they would probe beyond\nthem, just as they’d done in the back-channel talks. They were negotiators. They\nwere also smart, creative, badly wanted an agreement and, like me, believed it\nought to be possible. Though I would retain the final word to approve or reject\nwhat they suggested, I knew that only in a legal sense could it be null and void. I\nalso recognized, however, that we had to be willing to push further, both to find\nout for certain where the Palestinians stood and to convince the Americans we\ngenuinely wanted an agreement.\nShlomo and Gili left a little after midnight for Laurel Lodge. Marine guards\nwere posted at the doors, with orders that neither negotiating team was to leave\nuntil morning without notifying the President’s staff. Mother Nature provided a\nfurther incentive to stay inside, since it was again bucketing down with rain. The\nnegotiators talked not just through the night, but the next morning as well. It\nwasn’t until early afternoon that Shlomo and Gili came to my cabin to report on\nhow they’d gone. As I’d anticipated, both of them had ventured beyond\nconcessions that I was ready to consider, at least at a time when we weren’t even\nnear to a final peace deal. Taking the President’s instructions to heart, they’d said\n356\n/ BARAK / 71\nthey were willing to consider full Palestinian sovereignty over two Arab\nneighborhoods in East Jerusalem, and even some form of Palestinian authority and\ncontrol in the Christian and Muslim quarters inside the walls of the Old City. They\nhad dropped our insistence on Israeli control over the Jordan Valley, suggesting\nthat we hold on to only a small segment of the border with Jordan. They had gone\nbeyond the share of the West Bank allocated to a Palestinian state on the map that\nAbu Ala’a wouldn’t even look at. Now, they suggested around 90 percent. But\nwhen I asked what the Palestinian negotiators, Saeb Erekat and Mohammed\nDahlan, had proposed in return, the answer was almost nothing. They had taken\nnotes. They had asked questions. The one Palestinian proposal, from Saeb Erekat,\nwas on Jerusalem: Palestinian sovereignty over all the city’s predominantly Arab\nareas, and Israeli sovereignty over Jewish neighborhoods. In other words, a\ndivision of the city.\nEven though I was concerned that Gili and Shlomo had gone so far, especially\non Jerusalem, I’d reached the point where I doubted that even that would matter.\nWe were now in day-six of the summit, barely 48 hours from President Clinton’s\ndeparture for the G-8 summit, and we were negotiating only with ourselves.\nKnowing that the President planned to go see Arafat, I sat down and wrote him a\nnote – emotional not just because I did it quickly, but because of how deeply let\ndown I felt by the Palestinians’ deliberate avoidance of a peace deal which, with\ngenuine reciprocity, should have been within reach. “I took the report of Shlomo\nBen-Ami and Gilead Sher of last night’s discussion very badly...” it began. “This is\nnot a negotiation. This is a manipulative attempt to pull us to a position we will\nnever be able to accept, without the Palestinians moving one inch.” I reminded\nPresident Clinton that just as he was taking political risks, I was too. “Even the\npositions presented by our people last night, though they are not my positions,\nrepresent an additional risk,” I said.\nI said I doubted there would be another Israeli leader willing to engage in\nserious efforts for a final peace agreement with the Palestinians after what had\nhappened here. Unless things changed dramatically, I was not prepared for us to\nthrow out further suggestions, or consider painful concessions. “I do not intend to\nallow the Israeli state to fall apart, physically or morally. The State of Israel is the\nimplementation of the dream of the Jewish people, for generation upon generation.\nWe achieved it after enormous effort, and at the expenditure of a great deal of\nblood and sweat. There is no way I will preside at Camp David over the closing of\n357\n/ BARAK / 72\nthis saga.” I told the President that I still believed that we were facing a “moment\nof truth.” But only if he could “shake” Arafat, and get him to sense the enormity of\nthe stakes – an independent Palestinian state, versus more, and undoubtedly\ndeadlier, violence.\nAnd if it did come to armed conflict? “When the people of Israel will\nunderstand how far we were ready to go, we will have the power to stand together,\nunified, in such a struggle, however tough it will become, even if we will be forced\nto confront the entire world. There is no power in the world that can force on us\ncollective national suicide. Peace will be achieved only if there is a willingness to\nnegotiate on both sides. I am sure the people of Israel, and the American people,\nwill understand it when the details will be revealed.”\nClinton had already left for Arafat’s cabin by the time Danny Yatom went to\ndeliver the letter. But the President, too, was in a more sober and downbeat mood\nby the time that meeting was over. Late that night when, having now read my note,\nhe joined me on the balcony of Dogwood. He looked exhausted. “It was the\ntoughest meeting I’ve ever had with Arafat,” he said. Clinton said he had told the\nPalestinian leader that only one side, the Israelis, had so far been negotiating in\ngood faith. If Arafat was not prepared to make a genuine effort to reach an\nagreement, then there was no choice but for all of us to go home. Now, it seemed,\nboth the President and I were left to wait and see what, if anything, Arafat came up\nwith in reply.\n“I’ve been through battles, and danger, in my life,” I said. “But in terms of my\nresponsibility, today, for me as well, was probably the toughest. Shlomo and Gili\nwent beyond what I could live with. If this offer can’t move him, then I believe we\nare left to prepare for war.” I told the President he didn’t even need to phone me\nafter hearing from Arafat if all he offered was some clever half-reply. Only if it\nwas serious and substantive. I also reminded him that while he’d promised Arafat\nthat he would not “blame” the Palestinians if the summit failed, that had been on\nthe basis of negotiating in good faith. I hoped that, if the summit collapsed in these\ncircumstances, he would keep to that standard.\nFinally, I touched on an immediate concern if the summit broke up. For months,\nthe Palestinians had been talking about simply “declaring” a Palestinian state. The\nAmericans had insisted neither side should resort to unilateral action in a conflict\nwhose resolution depended on mutual agreement. The Europeans had been less\n358\n/ BARAK / 73\nexplicit. I told President Clinton I could speak only for how I would respond if a\nstate was indeed declared without a peace deal. “We will extend Israeli sovereignty\nover the major settlement blocs. We will establish a security zone in the Jordan\nvalley, and let them know that there will be a heavy price should they attack any of\nthe outlying settlements.” In other words, Palestinian unilateral action would\nprompt unilateral Israeli action. “And the confrontation will begin.”\n* * *\nClinton seemed, if not completely revived, considerably more upbeat when he\ncame back to see me an hour later. He told me that he had received the\nPalestinians’ answer. The way he described it to me, Arafat had agreed to leave\nPresident Clinton to decide the amount of West Bank land that would go to a\nPalestinian state, a figure he now told me that he was assuming would end up at\naround 90 to 92 percent. The trade-off, he said, would be a limited, “symbolic”\nland swap. Arafat also wanted control of the Jordan Valley, but had agreed to\nbegin negotiating on Israeli security needs there as soon as possible. Then, came\nArafat’s counter-conditions, which appeared to bother the President much less than\nthey did me. Everything would be contingent on an unspecified, “acceptable\noutcome on Jerusalem.” And despite Clinton’s emphasis that any meaningful\nagreement had to include a formal declaration that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nwas “over,” Arafat was insisting that could come only after the terms of whatever\nwe agreed were fully implemented.\nStill, it was at least a step forward. Clinton seemed genuinely encouraged, and I\ndidn’t want to risk closing off this first chink of light. I suggested, for instance, that\nwe could address Arafat’s reluctance about an “end of conflict” statement by\nproviding an American guarantee that the terms of the deal would be implemented.\nStill, it very soon became clear that any hope of real progress rested on by far\nthe most difficult issue: Jerusalem. Across party boundaries, even across divisions\nbetween religious and secular, nearly all Israelis viewed the city as not just our\ncapital, but the centrepiece of the state. It had been divided after 1948. The Old\nCity, and the site of the ancient Jewish temple, had been under Jordanian rule for\n19 years when our forces recaptured it in the Six-Day War. It was under a Labor\n359\n/ BARAK / 74\ngovernment that the area around the temple’s surviving Western Wall, left uncared\nfor under the Jordanians, was cleared and a stone plaza put in place for worshipers\n– at the expense of parts of the old Moroccan Quarter. It was under Labor, too, that\nIsrael unilaterally expanded Jerusalem’s city limits to take in more than two dozen\nadjacent Arab villages on the West Bank. No Israeli government since then, Labor\nor Likud, had deviated from a shared pledge that Jerusalem would remain Israel’s\nundivided, sovereign capital under any eventual peace agreement.\nYet when I met Clinton the next morning in Laurel Lodge, he insisted we had to\nfind some room for flexibility. He said that, of course, Israel would retain\nsovereignty over the Temple Mount: the site of the Western Wall and, above it, the\nAl-Aqsa mosque complex. “But without damaging your sovereignty,” he argued,\n“we have to find a way to draw a picture for Arafat that includes some measure of\nPalestinian control in part of the city.”\n“Could you agree to Arafat having an office, maybe, inside the walls of the Old\nCity,” he asked me. What about a form of administrative control in some of the\noutlying Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem? I replied that I couldn’t possibly\nanswer any of his questions until and unless it was clear that Arafat accepted our\nsovereignty over – and our national and religious connection with – the Temple\nMount. Yet I said I understood that we would have to reach some compromise\nagreement on the city if we were ever going to have a chance of a peace\nagreement. “But it’s an issue that is difficult for every Israeli,” I told him. Before I\ncould even begin to see whether there was a way forward, I would have to take it\nthrough with my entire negotiating team. Then, we could discuss it.\nIt turned out to be the most open, serious, searching discussion I was a part of\nduring all my years in public life. It began, on the terrace of my cabin, at two in the\nafternoon and went on until sundown. I introduced it by saying what each of us\nalready knew: Jerusalem was the most emotionally charged and politically\ncomplex issue of all. Our maximum position coming into the summit had been that\nwe would again expand the municipal boundaries of the city, as we’d done after\nthe 1967 war, in order to accommodate two separate “city councils.” One would be\nin Abu Dis, just to the southeast of the Old City, almost literally in the shadow of\nthe Temple Mount. The understanding was the Palestinians would be free to\nrename the village, referring to it by the Arabic name for Jerusalem: Al Quds. I\nsaid that we should use that position as a starting point, and discuss how, or\nwhether, we might go further. All I added was the need to be aware of what was at\n360\n/ BARAK / 75\nstake. I didn’t know whether peace was within reach. I was still deeply skeptical.\nBut if it was, we had to accept that Jerusalem would be key. And if the summit\nfailed, for whatever reason, what inevitably awaited us was “confrontation.”\nIsrael Hasson, the Shin Bet veteran, spoke first. He saw two choices. Either we\ncould retain Isrsaeli sovereignty over a “united Jerusalem” with functional, day-today\nautonomy for the Palestinians in their neighborhoods, or we could in effect\ndivide the city. “Divide sovereignty.” He didn’t say which he favored, only that it\nwas essential that we made the decision now if we could, however difficult or\nreluctant Arafat was as a negotiating partner. If we waited, we’d end up having to\ndeal with Islamists: Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Oded Eran, the career diplomat\nwhom I’d put in charge of frustrating, formal talks with the Palestinians in the\nmonths preceding the summit , said he was convinced that we should give the\nPalestinians full sovereignty over at least the “outer” Arab neighborhoods in East\nJerusalem, which had become part of the city only when we’d expanded the city\nboundaries after 1967. He said that was in Israel’s own interest. We had no historic\nconnection to these Arab villages, and something like 130,000 Palestinian lived\nthere. “Why should we want to annex them,” he asked. It would be like accepting\nthe “right of return” through the back door.\nDan Meridor’s voice, for me, was especially important. I knew he was as\ndetermined as I was to try to get a peace agreement with the Palestinians. But he\nwas also a former Likudnik, and a native Jerusalemite. “I’m against any\nconcessions when it comes to Israeli sovereignty,” he said. “Any attempt to divide\nJerusalem would be a serious blow, and not just for Jews in Israel.” For centuries,\nJewish communities all over the world, had looked to Jerusalem, prayed for\nJerusalem. The yearly Seder meal, on Passover, ends with the Hebrew phrase:\nShanah haba b’Yerushalaim. Next year, in Jerusalem. “What we decided here in\nCamp David,” Dan said, “also affects Jews in New York. In Moscow. In\nJohannesburg.” He urged us to focus instead on offering Arafat as attractive as\npossible a package of concessions on all the other issues. “Then let him decide.\nBut even if sovereignty over Jerusalem means that the deal collapses, I’m not\nwilling the pay that price.”\nNo voices were raised. It was the rarest of political discussions. People offered\ntheir views, and listened to others’. Amnon Lipkin pointed out that a large area of\nwhat was now came inside the boundaries of Jerusalem was not part of the city\nhe’d known before 1967. Echoing Oded Eran, he said: “It’s in our interest for as\n361\n/ BARAK / 76\nmany as possible of the Arab inhabitants to come under the authority of the\nPalestinians, and as few as possible under our rule.” Amnon’s bottom line was that\nwe could not give up Israeli sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which, although\nhe was a non-observant Jew, he called “the cradle of Jewish history.” But equally,\nwe couldn’t and shouldn’t “run the Al-Aqsa mosque.” He was also in favor of\nagreeing to what Clinton had asked of me: giving Arafat a base in the Muslim\nQuarter of the Old City. His one caveat was that we should not do any of this\nunless it was part of a genuine, final, peace agreement with the Palestinians.\nDanny Yatom urged us to move beyond our emotions and look for a practical\nsolution. “We all know how the boundaries of Jerusalem were drawn,” he said,\nreferring to the post-1967 expansion of the city. “They’re not holy. It is important\nto get down to our real red lines.” Eli Rubinstein, the attorney general, agreed.\nEven though he was an observant, Orthodox Jew, and more sympathetic politically\nto Likud than Labor, he concluded that we needed to include “as few Arabs as\npossible” under Israeli sovereignty, and to cede the outer villages to the\nPalestinians, adding: “This is a moment of truth.”\nIt was nearly five hours before I brought the discussion to a close. “This is as\ngrave a decision as when Ben-Gurion accepted the partition plan in 1947; the\ndeclaration of the state; or the most tense moments of the Yom Kippur War,” I\nsaid. “Or the decisions which Begin took in this same place.” Of course, Begin\nhadn’t even been willing to enter into discussion on Jerusalem. But we were in a\ndifferent situation. If we were going to get a true end to our conflict, the question\nof Jerusalem had to be addressed. “We can’t delay the decision. We can’t avoid it.\nWe will have to decide.” My own red line was the same as Amnon Lipkin’s:\n“sovereignty over the site of our First and Second Temples.” Even shared\nsovereignty elsewhere within the Old City seemed to me a step too far at this stage,\nbut I didn’t rule it out as part of a full peace. “Without disengagement from the\nPalestinians, without an end of conflict,” I reminded our negotiating team, “we’re\nheading toward further tragedy. We can’t pretend we don’t see the iceberg.”\nI asked several members of the team, under Shlomo Ben-Ami, to draft a paper\nbased on our discussion. Since I knew that Clinton, and Arafat too, could do\nnothing of substance until I’d resolved how far to go on Jerusalem, I went to see\nthe President. I told him about our session. I said that we were now crystallizing\nwhat had been said into a formal position, and I hoped to be able to return in a few\nhours with “the furthest point we can go.” Clinton said that would be a critical\n362\n/ BARAK / 77\nmoment in the summit. If we could find common ground, he said, Israel would\nhave achieved what had eluded it under Rabin, and even Ben-Gurion: “end of\nconflict, and Jerusalem recognized internationally as your capital.” I told him that\nthe discussion with my negotiators had been moving and illuminating. “I could see\nhow much it weighed on everyone.” But I added that I still did not feel anything of\na similar nature, or remotely as serious, was happening on the Palestinian side. I\nalso said that in deciding how to proceed, I couldn’t ignore political realities back\nhome. I would have to get any major change in our position concerning Jerusalem\nthrough the Knesset, even before putting a peace agreement to a referendum.\n“When will you get back to me with your paper?” he asked. I said I’d try by\nmidnight. I also asked him whether he could delay going to the G8 summit in\nJapan, for which he was due to leave Camp David on the morning of the 19 th . That\nmeant we had just one full day left. I said even if the plan was to resume our talks\nafterward, I couldn’t move on Jerusalem right before we recessed. It would mean\n“putting my last and best offer on the table” and running the risk of leaks in Israel\nwhile Clinton was gone. He said that he had to go to the G8, but would try to put\noff leaving for a further day. Then, he asked me to draw up a list of questions for\nhim to present to Arafat so that we could solidify our understanding of how far he\nwas ready to go for peace.\nI had Shlomo get busy on the list of questions. But it took time. We reconvened\naround eleven at night, to discuss both the questions and the Jerusalem package.\nThough it retained Israeli sovereignty over the entirety of the Old City, it did give\nthe Palestinians a greater measure of control over other areas of East Jerusalem\nthan any Israeli government had been willing to consider in the past. Still, almost\neveryone in the negotiating team could live with it, assuming it became the critical\nelement in a final peace. Dan Meridor, alone, remained firmly opposed, though\nElyakim Rubinstein also had some reservations. Even Dan said he understood the\nimportance of getting a peace agreement, if indeed it was possible, and our\nreadiness to discuss new proposals on Jerusalem.\nWhen I left for Clinton’s cabin at about 1:00 am on Wednesday, I had no idea I\nwas about to enter the most difficult meeting – and the only real fight – I had with\nhim during our long effort to achieve a Middle East peace. I brought Shlomo and\nDanny with me, which meant that Madeleine Albright, Dennis and Sandy Berger\nstayed as well. I sensed tension in all of them, in large part, I soon discovered,\nbecause they took exception to the more than twelve hours we had spent discussing\n363\n/ BARAK / 78\nand refining our position on Jerusalem. I think Clinton expected a formal offer\nfrom us. Since I’d been guided by his request for a list of questions for Arafat,\nhowever, that is what we came to him with. As we’d discussed, I wanted finally to\nelicit some sign of whether Arafat, too, was ready to make difficult decisions.\nThe questions were specific. “Will you accept an agreement that stipulates the\nfollowing...” it began, and proceeded to outline the kind of peace we could accept\nand still hoped for. The points included not just Jerusalem, but areas I knew would\nalso be sensitive for Arafat, such as the “right of return” and formal agreement to\nan end of conflict. We went further than before in some areas. One of the outer\nEast Jerusalem neighborhoods would be under Palestinian sovereignty. The rest of\nthe city would remain under Israeli sovereignty, but most of the other Arab villages\nwould be subject to a system of Palestinian administration. The Haram al-Sharif,\nthe mosque complex above the wall of the Jewish temple, would be under\nPalestinian “administrative and religious management.” We also suggested\n“special arrangements” implying a Palestinian presence in the Old City, but again\nunder Israeli sovereignty. The questions envisaged eventual Palestinian control in\nthe Jordan Valley, with an Israeli security zone for 12 years, rather than our\nproposal in pre-summit talks for 30 years. Then, explicitly, we proposed a question\nto Arafat to confirm my understanding with Clinton that the “right of return”\nwould apply not to Israel proper, but to a Palestinian state on the West Bank and\nGaza. Finally, the document said: “I understand that such an agreement constitutes\nan end of conflict.”\nAfter he read it, the President blew up. Far from the “bottom lines” he’d\napparently hoped for, but which I’d never thought were expected at this stage, I\nseemed to be retreating from ideas Shlomo and Gili had presented in their all-night\nsession with the Palestinians. Given the ground rules of that exercise, they’d felt\nable to go beyond anything we’d actually agreed, and in some areas beyond what\nthey knew I could support. As a result, the list of questions assumed Israel would\nkeep a little more than 11 percent of the West Bank, nearly one percent more than\nShlomo had mentioned. Shlomo and Gili had also raised the possibility of up to\nthree of the outer Jerusalem villages coming under full Palestinian sovereignty.\n“You keep us, and Arafat, waiting for 13 hours,” Clinton fumed, his face nearly\nscarlet. “And you want me to present something less than you’ve already offered.”\nHe said he wouldn’t do it. “This is not real. It’s not serious.” He said that he’d\ngone to Shepherdstown in search of what was supposed to be an endgame with the\n364\n/ BARAK / 79\nSyrians. Then to Geneva to see Assad, “where I felt like a wooden Indian, doing\nyour bidding. I will not let it happen here. I will simply not do it.”\nI tried to keep my voice steady when I replied. I explained that the issues we\nwere addressing went to the heart of Israel’s interests, its future security, its\nidentity and definition as a nation. I had a responsibility to tread carefully. Then,\nmy voice rising too, I came back to what I felt was the real problem. Arafat and his\nnegotiators had been sitting and waiting for me and my team, and probably Clinton\nas well, to deliver more and more concessions with no sign that they were willing\nto move on anything. “I find that outrageous,” I said. I did not expect Arafat to\nrespond with equal concessions. After all, Israel had most of the tangible assets.\n“But I did expect him at least to take a small step once we had taken ten. We have\nnot seen even this. This is the kind of behavior parents would not tolerate in their\nown children! We don’t expect Arafat to accept this, but I do expect him to present\na counter-position.”\nClinton remained adamant he couldn’t go to Arafat with a retreat from our\nearlier ideas. “My negotiating team moved beyond my red lines,” I told him. The\novernight talks were supposed to be non-binding and assumed that both sides\nwould make a genuine attempt to get an agreement. “I can’t see any change in\nArafat’s pattern. We take all the risks.” I said I doubted that Arafat expected to\nhear that we had decided to “give him Jerusalem.” In any case, the Israeli public\nhadn’t given me a mandate to do that. But I would still move in Arafat’s direction,\nif and when I got any sign he was willing to do the same.\nThe President’s anger eased. He suggested he caucus with his negotiators and\nfigure out what to do next. I felt bad about what had happened: not about the list of\nquestions, or my insistence that we could not offer major concessions with no sign\nof reciprocity. But I did regret that it had left the Americans so frustrated, and\nClinton so angry. He had invested not just huge amounts of time and brainpower,\nbut political capital, in the search for peace.\nHe phoned me at about 3:30 in the morning and asked me to come back. This\ntime, I went alone. We sat on the terrace of Aspen. He said again he couldn’t go to\nArafat with the list we’d drawn up. But having met with his negotiators, he\nsuggested they draft a more forthcoming list of their own – consistent with what\nShlomo and Gili had proposed. I agreed, as long as they kept in mind that it had to\nbe something I could ultimately live with, and that it be presented to Arafat as an\n365\n/ BARAK / 80\nAmerican proposal. I suggested the President could tell Arafat that he’d try to get\nme to agree to it, providing Arafat first showed a readiness to move.\nThe American questions did go further than ours. They asked Arafat whether he\nwould negotiate on the basis of getting Palestinian sovereignty over all the outer\nJerusalem neighborhoods, as well as the Muslim Quarter of the Old City and a\n“custodial role” over the holy sites. But Arafat said no. He insisted on Palestinian\nsovereignty over all of East Jerusalem, including the Old City and the holy sites.\nFor a few hours after Clinton’s fruitless meeting with Arafat, Dennis and the\nAmerican team engaged in a rescue effort, adding another carrot. They included\nthe Christian Quarter as well, meaning Palestinian sovereignty over nearly half of\nthe Old City, including the areas where almost all Arab residents lived. Dennis\ngave the proposal to Shlomo and Amnon Lipkin to bring to me, and asked two of\nthe Palestinian negotiators to take it to Arafat. Even offering sovereignty over the\nMuslim Quarter went beyond anything I’d proposed. So did a lot of the other\nAmerican questions. Still, I said we’d be ready to consider them in discussions\nwith the US negotiating team – with the exception of the Christian Quarter. But\nthat, too, turned out not to matter. Arafat did not even respond.\nClinton called me to say we’d reached the end of the road. There were only two\noptions: end the summit and announce we’d tried and failed, or defer Jerusalem\nand try to get agreement on the rest of the issues. I asked for time to think it over,\nand he said he’d come see me when I was ready. I was tempted to put off\nJerusalem. In the admittedly unlikely event we could get a deal on the other issues,\nthat would undeniably be an achievement. But I couldn’t help thinking that\nArafat’s lack of engagement on Jerusalem was yet another sign that he was not\nready for the almost equally tough compromises required to resolve the other core\nissues. And there was no escaping the reality that without a deal on Jerusalem, no\nagreement we reached would truly represent an “end of conflict.” Moreover,\nJerusalem wasn’t just a Palestinian issue. It was of fundamental interest to the\nwhole Muslim world. If we left it unaddressed, we would be putting future Israeli\ngovernments in the position of having to negotiate on Jerusalem after we’d given\nback our key negotiating assets and all our leverage.\nI accepted now that the search of a full peace treaty, or even a framework\nagreement, looked all but impossible. Even Shlomo’s and Gili’s freelancing had\nproduced only a series of no’s from Arafat. But I felt I couldn’t give up. Much as\nI’d been resisting it, I believed I needed to give Clinton my true bottom lines, even\n366\n/ BARAK / 81\nwith Arafat still mute and unresponsive. That was the only way we could know\nwith certainty whether peace was possible. If it wasn’t, it would also demonstrate\npowerfully to the Americans that we were not the party who had prevented an\nagreement.\nThe President came to see me in Dogwood a little before 11 at night on the 18 th ,\nless than 12 hours before he was due to take his delayed flight to the G8. I told him\nI’d decided to do what Rabin had done with Syria. I was going to give him a\n“deposit” to keep in his pocket, which he would be free to use as the basis for a\nfurther, American proposal to Arafat, assuming it was part of an agreement with a\n“satisfactory resolution” of the refugee issue and an explicit end-of-conflict. He\ncould present it as something which he could tell Arafat he was confident of\npersuading Israel to accept. It went well beyond what I’d offered before, on all the\nmajor issues. I proposed Palestinian rule over 91 percent of the West Bank. I was\nready for a Palestinian state to have sovereignty over 85 percent of the border in\nthe Jordan Valley as well, and our security zone there would stay in place for “less\nthan 12 years.” Seven out of the nine outer Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem\nwould come under Palestinian sovereignty. The inner neighborhoods would be\nunder Palestinian civil authority: including planning and zoning, and lawenforcement.\nFor the mosques on the Temple Mount, I proposed a shared\ncustodianship to include the new state of Palestine, Morocco and the chair of the\nHigher Islamic Commission in Jerusalem. I also agreed to consider Palestinian\nsovereignty over both the Muslim and Christian quarters of the Old City.\nClinton, arching his eyebrows and smiling, said what I’d offered was a package\nof genuine concessions. It was more than he had expected and, he assumed, more\nthan the Palestinians could have hoped for. It had the makings of a potential\nbreakthrough toward a fair and final peace. I told him I hoped so. But given\nArafat’s behavior so far, I had my doubts.\nNow, it was our turn to wait. The President invited Arafat to Aspen and, from\nwhat we heard soon afterwards, got no hint of any readiness to reciprocate. He\nagreed only to talk to his negotiators and get back with an answer. Overnight, the\nPalestinians sent messages to the Americans asking questions on each of the\nconcessions, though still with no indication from Arafat of a response. Finally, he\nsent a suggestion that since Clinton was about to fly off to the G8, we take a twoweek\nbreak to allow Arafat to consult with Arab leaders. To his credit, Clinton\nknew an escape act when he saw it. He recognized that only by confronting the\n367\n/ BARAK / 82\nissues raised by our proposals and showing a willingness to find common ground\nwould we have any hope of success. No recess, Clinton said. He needed a straight\nanswer. Again, not full acceptance necessarily, but agreement to treat the proposals\nas a basis for negotiating an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Arafat’s answer came shortly\nbefore dawn. It was “no”.\nClinton couldn’t quite believe it. He went back to see Arafat, telling him he was\nmaking an error on the scale of 1948, when the Palestinians had rejected the\npartition of Palestine and the creation of an Arab state; or in 1978, when by\nnegotiating on the basis of Sadat’s Palestinian-rights framework, they would have\nended up with a mere 5,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank instead of nearly\n200,000. What most astonished Clinton was that Arafat was saying no even to\nusing the package as a basis for negotiations. Still, Arafat would not budge.\nAs Palestinian negotiators tried to salvage things by suggesting another trip by\nMadeleine and Dennis to the Middle East, it was clear that even the Americans\nwere fed up. They knew that one side, at least, had been trying to get an agreement.\nThey couldn’t understand why Arafat was unwilling even to accept the “pocket”\nproposals as a basis for further talks. When Yossi Ginossar, our most reliable\nconduit, went to see Arafat, he found him sitting alone and, in Yossi’s description,\n“paralyzed.” Clinton finally decided to have one last go. When he did, Arafat not\nonly remained unwilling. To the President’s astonishment, he insisted that the\nancient Jewish temple hadn’t been in Jerusalem at all, but in the West Bank city of\nNablus.\nI was getting a bite to eat in the dining room in Laurel Lodge when Madeleine\nshowed up. She didn’t bother defending Arafat. She was as frustrated as I was. Her\nmessage was that after the summit, it was important not to make things worse. A\nnegotiating process had to be kept alive. Then, Clinton sat down with me. He\ndelivered a similar message, but with even greater feeling. “You’re smarter than I\nam,” he joked. “You’re certainly experienced in war, and I’m not. But I’m more\nexperienced in politics, and there are a few things I’ve learned along the way. The\nmost important is not to corner your adversaries, and not to corner yourself.\nAlways leave yourself a way out. Don’t lock yourself into a losing option.” I could\nsee that he was right. I also believed, as strongly now as before the summit, that\nIsrael’s own interests and its security were not served by an unresolved conflict\nwith the Palestinians. The problem was that, in the absence of an equal\ncommitment on Arafat’s side, any continued negotiating process seemed futile.\n368\n/ BARAK / 83\nI packed my bags. I told Danny Yatom to inform the Americans we were\nleaving and to get our plane ready to take us back to Israel. I let the others in our\nteam know that we were going. A number of them, and several of the Americans as\nwell, urged me to reconsider. But I said I saw no point in staying. What I didn’t\nknow, however, was that one of the Palestinians’ original Oslo negotiators, Hassan\nAsfour, had approached Dennis Ross with a new proposal: that we ask Arafat to\naccept everything except the proposal on the holy sites as a basis for negotiation.\nSovereignty over the Temple Mount would be addressed in later, international\nnegotiations. When Dennis brought this to me, my instinct was to say no. Like so\nmuch else at the summit, it was an inherently skewed formula: it would involve\nmajor Israeli concessions on all the other main issues, without securing our\nabsolute minimum need in Jerusalem: sovereignty over the Temple Mount. I didn’t\nsay yes. Still, with Clinton’s words of advice still on my mind, I said that I’d think\nit over.\nWhen I met the rest of the Israeli team, almost all of them felt we should stay.\nThe consensus was that especially if violence broke out after the summit’s\ncollapse, we didn’t want to feel we’d left any stone unturned. At about 11 pm, I\nphoned the President and told him that we would stay until he returned from\nOkinawa. He was clearly pleased, and asked us to keep working in his absence.\nWhen I resisted that, saying that any substantive talks needed his involvement, we\nfinally agreed that talks could continue in search of a formula for the holy sites. On\nall the other issues, only informal discussions would be held until and unless a way\nahead on the Temple Mount was found. If that happened, and if Arafat finally\naccepted the “pocket” proposals as an agreed starting point, formal negotiations\ncould resume. Clinton accepted this formula. He went to see Arafat and secured –\nor thought he had secured – his agreement as well.\nOne of the President’s great strengths was his genius for blurring the edges of\npotential differences in search of common ground. But when edges had to be\nsharpened, this could lead to confusion. Before leaving for the G8, the President\nneglected to mention to Arafat our explicit understanding that, with the exception\nof the talks on the holy sites, nothing would happen until he accepted the\nconcessions that President Clinton and I had delivered as at least a basis for further\nnegotiations. As a result, Arafat’s team now set about happily asking questions and\nprobing my negotiators – pushing us to go further – but with no more inclination\nthan before to produce any concessions of their own.\n369\n/ BARAK / 84\nWhen I learned what was happening, I told my negotiators they were not to\nhold any further formal meetings during the four days Clinton would be away.\nDennis’s initial response was frustration. Madeleine Albrights’s was fury. They\nboth made no secret of their view that I was needlessly stonewalling. It wasn’t until\na few hours later that Madeleine apparently saw the stenographer’s record of my\nconversation with the President before he’d left, confirming the condition that\nArafat accept the “pocket” at least as a basis on which to proceed. That evening,\nshe apologized to me for the misunderstanding, and explained the mix-up to the\nfull Palestinian and Israeli negotiating teams.\nI spent most of the remaining three days in my cabin or, when the rain relented,\nwalking through the woods. The Americans appeared to think I was sulking. I\nwasn’t. I was trying to find the least diplomatically damaging way to navigate the\nperiod until the President’s return. I couldn’t see showing up at Laurel at every\nmealtime, mingling and joking with the Americans and Palestinians, but refusing\nto enter into any form of negotiations. That would compound the awkwardness of\nthe situation, and also be a direct affront to Madeleine. I liked and respected her.\nBut I could not in good conscience help her out in her efforts to find at least some,\ninformal, way of moving the summit along in Clinton’s absence. If Arafat had\nfailed to show even a scintilla of movement with the President in the room, I knew\nthere was no way that he was going to do so with the Secretary of State. For the\nPalestinian negotiators, who were predictably in favour of her efforts, the\ndefinition of “new ideas” was whatever further movement they might cajole out of\nour negotiators. Still, on day-three of Clinton’s absence, I got a note saying that\nSecretary Albright was on her way to my cabin. I didn’t want the needless\ndiplomatic difficulty involved in again telling her I could not sanction freewheeling,\nand decidedly one-sided, negotiations while Arafat hadn’t moved a\nsingle inch. So I made myself scarce. Fortunately, I was wearing sneakers. I told\nDanny to inform the Americans I was out jogging around the perimeter of the large\nCamp David estate, and went off to do just that.\nI told my own delegation I was taking time out to assess where we stood. I did\ncontinue meeting with Gili Sher and Danny Yatom. Yet for much of time, I read. I\nalso did a lot of thinking. I considered the “pocket” concessions I’d agreed to, the\nuncertainties and risks I’d been prepared to run, and the need to decide how to deal\nwith the fact that Arafat, when he had engaged at all, had said “no”.\n370\n/ BARAK / 85\nOnce it was clear to the Americans there would be no talks until the President\nreturned, however, Madeline began urging me to go see Arafat personally. The two\nmembers of our team who were the least pessimistic about Camp David’s outcome,\nShlomo Ben-Ami and Yossi Ginossar, also said they thought it was a good idea. It\nwas they who’d pressed me to go see Arafat for tea and sweets earlier in the\nsummit. But that meeting had produced not even a glimmer of negotiating\nflexibility from the Palestinian leader. Yossi had said at the time that it would help\nthe atmosphere, and pay dividends later on. But that hadn’t happened either.\n“Madam Secretary,” I told Madeleine, “eating more baklava with Arafat isn’t\ngoing to help. The situation is simple: he needs to answer whether he views the\nPresident’s proposal as a basis for going forward.”\nWhen Clinton returned, he promptly got back down to business: making one\nlast push to see whether a peace deal was possible. He phoned me around midnight\non the 24 th of July, a few hours after he’d arrived. He told me he had sent an even\nmore far-reaching package to Arafat, expanding on my proposals. Now, all of the\nouter Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem would come under Palestinian\nsovereignty, in addition to the Muslim and Christian quarters in the Old City. And\nArafat would be given “custodial sovereignty” over the Muslim holy sites on the\nTemple Mount. I didn’t object. Though it was further than I felt I could go, it was\nwithin the spirit of my “pocket deposit”. The same ground rules still applied: these\nwere American proposals, which the President was telling Arafat he would try to\ndeliver if he accepted them as a basis for serious negotiations. But when Clinton\nphoned me back, around 3:15 in the morning, it was to tell me that Arafat had\nagain said no.\nThe curtain had finally come down. What remained now was to clear up the set.\nI did meet Arafat once more, in a joint session with President Clinton, but only for\nclosing statements. The President and I spoke as much in sorrow and frustration as\nanger. Both of us said we thought an historic agreement had been within our grasp,\nand that far-reaching proposals had been tabled to make it possible. Arafat\nresponded with words both of us had heard before: effusive toward Clinton,\nrhapsodic about his “old partner” Rabin and fulsome in his ostensible commitment\nto keep trying for peace. But it was just words. We knew he was not willing even\nto talk about the kind of compromises a real, final peace would require.\nThe President’s remarks to the media were, by the standards of post-summit\ndiplomacy, unmistakably clear in making that point. He praised me and the Israeli\n371\n/ BARAK / 86\nnegotiating team for courage and vision. Essentially, he thanked Arafat for\nshowing up. That was some consolation. But it didn’t alter the weight of the\nmessage we were carrying home. Arafat either would not or could not make peace,\nat least on terms any Israel leader could accept or the people of Israel would\nendorse.\nThere were only two potential deal-breakers on our side, as Arafat had known\nfrom the beginning. The first involved the “right of return.” We were never going\nto sign a peace agreement accepting the return of hundreds of thousands of\nPalestinians within our pre-1967 borders. Demographically, that was a recipe for\nthe inexorable end of Israel as a majority-Jewish state. It would also imply a\nrewriting of the history of how Israel was born: in a war, with an almost equal\nnumber of refugees either fleeing or forced to leave on both sides, after the Arab\nworld had unanimously, and violently, rejected a UN partition that would have\ncreated a Palestinian Arab state as well. I did accept a “right of return” to the\nPalestinian state we had hoped to create, as part of a final peace deal, on the West\nBank and in Gaza. I also supported the idea of a multi-billion-dollar international\nfund to compensate or resettle Palestinian refugees, and was ready to commit Israel\nas a party to that effort. The other critical issue was Jerusalem. I had stretched our\nnegotiating position almost to breaking point. The “pocket” ideas Arafat ended up\nrejecting challenged a longstanding Israeli political taboo. In practical terms, they\namounted to a breach of the assurances which I and every other Israeli Prime\nMinister since 1967 had given: never to re-divide Israel’s capital. Had we actually\ngot an end-of-conflict deal, I would have had to justify it to Israelis in a\nreferendum. I think I could have done so. But one thing I could not give up was our\nsovereignty over the Temple Mount, the centerpiece of our history as a people and\nIsrael’s as a state. It was our connection with our past, a focus of what we had gone\nthrough, what we had achieved, and what we had left to accomplish. It was\nessential to who we were.\nArafat never even engaged in a discussion on the “right of return”. On the\nTemple Mount, however, he was explicit. Any peace, any basis for negotiation\ntoward peace, had to begin by confirming Palestinian sovereignty. Besides, as he’d\ntold the President of the United States, he had persuaded himself there never was a\nJewish temple in Jerusalem. When I heard about that remark, I was less shocked\nthan Clinton. It struck me as just another way Arafat had of conveying his bottom\nlines. It was a bit like stories he liked to tell about visiting his aunt in Jerusalem as\n372\n/ BARAK / 87\na young boy and seeing religious Jews walking through the streets of the Old City.\nI don’t know whether those stories were true. But the point was that while he had\nno problem with Jews in their long coats and black hats praying in the holy city,\nJews exercising authority or sovereignty, or a Jewish state, was something else\nentirely. Camp David had made it clear it was something he was not prepared to\naccept.\nThe question which I now had to confront was what to do next.\n373\n/ BARAK / 88\nChapter Twenty-Three\nIt didn’t fully hit me how draining our efforts had been until the morning that\nthe summit collapsed, when President Clinton called me to come talk to him in the\nliving room at Laurel Lodge. When I arrived, Madeleine was already there, sitting\non the edge of the sofa. She greeted me with a resigned shrug and a valiant but not\naltogether successful effort at a smile.\n“We tried,” Clinton said quietly as I took a seat in a wooden chair opposite his.\n“We gave it everything.” The nominal reason for the meeting was to brief me on\nthe communiqué the Americans were going to issue: mostly boilerplate assurances\nthat both sides remained committed to seeking peace, but with an additional\n“understanding” that neither would take unilateral actions in the meantime. But\nmostly, Clinton wanted to reinforce his message of a few days earlier: don’t “lock\nyourself into a losing option.” Don’t close the door. Don’t give up. “I won’t,” I told\nhim, an assurance I echoed in remarks to reporters a few hours later, when I said\nthat while the peace process had “suffered a major blow, we should not lose hope.\nWith goodwill on all sides, we can recuperate.”\nBut I told the President that we couldn’t just ignore what had happened at Camp\nDavid. Yes, in the event Arafat suddenly had second thoughts about the potentially\nhistoric achievement he’d passed up, he would know where to find me. But until\nand unless that happened, I told Clinton that I assumed my “pocket” concessions\nwould now be firmly back in his pocket. And while we couldn’t erase them from\nmemory, I said it was important both of us make it clear that, in legal and\ndiplomatic terms, they were not going to provide Arafat a new starting point from\nwhich he could make his customary demand for more.\n“And I have to tell you that, given what has happened, there’s no way I can\njustify handing him control of more land. I am not going to go ahead with the Wye\nredeployments in these circumstances.”\n“You don’t have to,” Clinton replied. “I’ll back you.”\nThough I never discussed internal Israeli politics with any foreign leader, even\nthe closest of allies, I didn’t doubt that the President’s support was partly a\nrecognition of what awaited me once I got home. The compromises I’d been\nwilling to consider had gone further – much further, on the politically combustible\n374\n/ BARAK / 89\nquestion of Jerusalem – than any Israeli leader in the search for peace. Even before\nI’d left for Camp David, the defections from our coalition meant we’d been left\nwith only 42 seats in the Knesset, nineteen short of a majority. Amid the first,\nsketchy media reports that we were even talking about sharing control of parts of\nJerusalem with the Palestinians, there was a chorus of denunciation from rightwing\npoliticians back home. Bibi Netanyahu had largely kept out of the public eye\nsince his resignation after the election. Now, he issued a statement accusing me of\nhaving “broken all the red lines held by all Israeli governments.” During the\nPresident’s final push to save the prospects for a summit agreement, Bibi called a\nnews conference. He said he was determined to prevent what he called an\nimpending disintegration of Israeli society. “What we hear from most of the reports\nout of Camp David does not answer our hopes,” he said.\nIt hadn’t answered my hopes either. But I had gone into the summit with my\neyes open. Frustrated though I was by the way the summit had ended, I had no\nregrets about going as far as I had in trying to reach, at the minimum, a framework\nagreement. In that sense, it is true the summit had failed. But when I’d urged\nPresident Clinton to convene it, I made the argument that if genuine peace was\never going to be possible, we at least had to know whether Arafat was interested in,\nor capable of, playing his part. That question had, for now, been answered. At least\nas importantly for Israel, the President of the United States and almost the entire\ninternational community recognized we’d done everything realistically possible to\nreach an accommodation. Diplomatically, the ball was in the Palestinians’ court.\nThere was a final achievement as well – little noticed or remarked upon in the\ndays immediately after Camp David, but hugely significant. A taboo had been\nbroken. For the first time, all Israelis recognized what their political leaders, both\nLabor and Likud, had long known: a formal, final peace with the Palestinians, if\nand when it came, would require us not just to withdraw from the great majority of\nthe West Bank, but to find a formula for sharing power in Jerusalem. Many Israelis\nstill believed that was a price too high, and not just Likudniks. A couple of weeks\nafter the summit, Leah Rabin told an Israeli newspaper that her late husband would\nbe “turning in his grave” if he’d known the concessions I’d been ready to consider\non Jerusalem. I found the remarks hurtful, but I understood them. In a way, they\ndrove home the point I’d made to Clinton during the summit: all Israelis had a\ndeep, emotional attachment to our historic capital. “Yitzhak would never have\nagreed to compromise on the Old City and the Temple Mount,” Leah said,\n375\n/ BARAK / 90\n“because for him, Jerusalem was sacred from a strictly national and historic point\nof view.” It was for me as well. In fact, I think its religious significance probably\nresonated more strongly. Still, the major change from the summit was that even\nthose Israelis who found a compromise on Jerusalem unacceptable recognized that,\nif they did want to negotiate a definitive end to the conflict, talking about it was\nunavoidable.\nAt least for now, however, there wasn’t going to be a peace deal. As our El Al\n707 descended over the Mediterranean for our approach back to Ben-Gurion\nAirport, I faced the more immediate issue of ensuring my government survived.\nThis was partly in case, against all odds, Arafat showed a readiness to revive the\nsearch for peace – but also because of the real prospect he would choose violence\ninstead.\n* * *\nSince the Knesset was about to go into recess until late October, I would have a\nthree-month window to reshape and stabilize my coalition – but only if we could\nweather a no-confidence motion introduced by Arik Sharon after Camp David. We\ndid weather it, barely. Arik needed a majority of the Knesset’s 120 seats to bring\ndown the government. The vote ended in a 50-50 tie. The other 20 MKs abstained,\nor didn’t show up. This was not because of any enthusiasm for my efforts to get an\nagreement at Camp David, but because of a lack of enthusiasm for an early\nelection in which they feared losing seats.\nStill, that did allow me to focus on the challenge of the inevitably altered\nsituation with Arafat after the summit’s collapse. My main concern was the\npossibility of violence. Even before returning home, I’d phoned Shaul Mofaz and\nAvi Dichter, the former Sayeret Matkal officer who was now head of the Shin Bet.\n“Let’s hope the violence doesn’t come,” I told them. “But if it does, make sure we\nare ready.” Though there was no sign of violence in the weeks immediately after\nthe summit, there was equally little sign of diplomatic engagement by Arafat.\nObviously relieved at the way Camp David had ended, he returned to Gaza to a\nhero’s welcome, proudly proclaiming that he had refused to “give up” Jerusalem. It\nwas vintage Arafat: the “general” in his starched uniform and kefiyeh, fresh from\n376\n/ BARAK / 91\nthe diplomatic equivalent of the battlefield, triumphant against the odds. It was the\nrole he liked and played best. His next move was to take the show on the road: to\nArab, European and world capitals, pleading that he had been the “victim” of\nsummit chicanery in which President Clinton and I had presented him with a deal\nno self-respecting Palestinian could accept. He was also campaigning for\ninternational support for a move, in contravention of the final Camp David\ncommuniqué, to “declare” a Palestinian state unilaterally in mid-September.\nI spoke personally to Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac, and also\ndispatched Shlomo-Ben Ami, Amnon Lipkin, Yossi Beilin and Shimon Peres, who\nwas Minister of Regional Cooperation in the coalition, on a series of diplomatic\nvisits to make sure the true story of what had happened at the summit was\nunderstood. As a result, the globetrotting Arafat received an almost unanimous\nrebuff for the idea of a unilateral declaration of stateheood. He was told that if he\nreally wanted a state, he should return to the negotiating table with Israel.\nBy the time I went to New York in early September – joining the largest\ncollection of world leaders ever assembled, for the UN’s Millennium Summit –\nthere seemed little chance of that happening. I met privately with a number of\nworld leaders before delivering a brief address to the more than 150 presidents and\nprime ministers. I was at pains to take the high road. None of the foreign leaders I\nmet had expressed any doubt that we’d gone much further than they had expected\nat Camp David, and that the onus for putting diplomacy back on track rested firmly\nwith the Palestinians. Looking straight at Arafat from the UN podium, I said: “We\nare at the Rubicon, and neither of us can cross it alone.” Jerusalem, “the eternal\ncapital of Israel,” was calling out for a “peace of honor, of courage and of\nbrotherhood” – a peace recognizing that the city was also sacred to Muslims and\nChristians the world over. When Arafat spoke, it was almost as if the summit had\nnever happened. “We remain committed to our national rights over East Jerusalem,\ncapital of our state and shelter of our sacred sites, as well as our rights on the\nChristian and Islamic holy sites,” he declared. He didn’t mention Jews, beyond a\nbizarre reference to the 2,000 th anniversary of the birth of Christ “in Bethlehem,\nPalestine.” I couldn’t resist remarking to one of the American negotiators that I’d\nalways thought Jesus grew up as a Jewish boy, making thrice-yearly visits at\nfestival time to the temple in Jerusalem, at a time when there was not a church,\nmuch less a mosque, in sight.\n377\n/ BARAK / 92\nStill, in my meetings with Clinton, I assured him I was not giving up altogether\non the prospects for peace. Not only did I feel that would be wrong, as long as\nthere was a scintilla of hope. I believed that our continued diplomatic engagement\nmight provide a counterweight to any moves by Arafat to revert to violence. It was\nalso critical for Israel to retain the diplomatic, political and moral high ground we\nhad earned in the eyes of the international community from the concessions we had\nbeen willing to consider. When the President suggested drafting a final American\npaper, based on Camp David though presumably with an even more generous\nproposal for the Palestinians, I agreed. I figured even Arafat might realize at some\npoint that if he did want a negotiated peace, the time for dithering was over.\nClinton would no longer be president in five months’ time. Unless I could find an\nalternative way to refortify my coalition over the coming weeks, it was entirely\npossible I’d have to form a “unity” coalition with Arik and the Likud. Still, I told\nPresident Clinton I doubted the ticking clock would make a difference to the\nPalestinian leader. If it didn’t, I believed at some point all our talk about an “end of\nconflict” would give way to conflict. The only question was when.\nTragically, I got the answer only weeks after my return from the UN.\n* * *\nAt the urging of the Americans, I invited Arafat and his negotiating team to a\nprivate dinner in Kochav Yair on the 25th of September. The atmosphere was\nsurprisingly warm, for which a lot of the credit, as well as culinary praise, has to go\nto Nava. “Very cordial, even congenial,” Nabil Shaath told reporters after the\ndinner, nearly 45 minutes of which I spent talking alone with Arafat on the stone\nterrace out back. Each of us spoke to Clinton for about 10 minutes near the end,\nand the President was obviously pleased to hear us sounding upbeat about trying to\nnarrow any differences on the forthcoming American negotiating paper. On the\nsubstance of our differences, by mutual agreement, Arafat and I didn’t say much to\neach other. I did try to impress on him that time was getting short. His\nmonosyllabic reply – yes – was at least better than the alternative. I chose to\nbelieve we could both now focus on trying again.\n378\n/ BARAK / 93\nThe request that had come across my desk a few days earlier need not have\nchanged that. Even though Arik had failed, for now, to bring down the\ngovernment, he was keen to make political capital from the collapse of Camp\nDavid. He now declared his intention to pay a visit to the Temple Mount. The\nMount – or as it was called in Arabic, Haram al-Sharif – was part of Israel. The\nunsubtle point of Arik’s visit was to dramatize his determination to keep it that\nway. The target of this political theatre was not Arafat or the Palestinians. It was\nthe Israeli public, me, and my government. In an all-perfect world, I would have\nliked to find a way to block the visit. In a democracy, it wasn’t that easy. The only\nway I could do so was on the grounds it was a threat to public order or security, a\njudgement in the hands of our police and security services. I duly asked for the\nviews of Avi Dichter of the Shin Bet, and Shlomo Ben-Ami, who in addition to\nbeing interim Foreign Minister was Minister of Internal Security, in charge of the\npolice. Both came back with the same answer: though we’d all be happier if Arik\nstayed down on his farm in the Negev, there was no reason to expect his visit\nwould pose a major public-order issue, and no basis for blocking it. When Shlomo\ncontacted Jibril Rajoub, Arafat’s West Bank security commander, Rajoub asked\nonly that two conditions be imposed, and Shlomo agreed. The first was that the\nvisit not occur on a Friday, when the mosques would be full of worshipers; the\nsecond, that Sharon not set foot in either of the mosques on the Haram. Our chief\nof police informed Sharon that if he didn’t accept the conditions, we’d deny him\npermission to go. But he agreed. When he went, for about half an hour under\npolice escort on Thursday morning the 28 th , he complied.\nAt first, we thought it would prove a one-off media stunt. But that evening,\nDanny Yatom brought me an intelligence report with evidence that Arafat’s\nPalestinian Authority was planning for wide-scale violence after Friday prayers, in\nprotest over Sharon’s visit. Danny called Dennis Ross. Madeleine Albright called\nArafat, to urge him to ensure this didn’t happen. But as Dennis would remark later,\n“Arafat didn’t lift finger to stop it.”\nThe trouble began the next day, shortly after Friday prayers. It was also the eve\nof the Jewish New Year, and the Western Wall area was crowded. As people\npoured out of the mosques, a number began hurling stones, some of them the size\nof small boulders, onto the Jewish worshippers and police below. One knocked out\nthe highly experienced, steady-handed commander of the Jerusalem police, which\nI’m sure contributed to making the confrontation that followed even worse. By the\n379\n/ BARAK / 94\nend of the day, dozens of Israelis and Palestinians were injured. Five Palestinians\nlay dead. Though the media almost instantly labelled it a new “intifada”, this one\nwas very different. It was not a burst of anger, however misdirected, by stonethrowing\nyouths convinced that a road accident in Gaza had been something more\nsinister. There had been no serious unrest on the day of Arik’s visit. We would\nlater learn this was a deliberate campaign, waged with guns and grenades, by\nHamas and Islamic Jihad, the Fatah offshoot Tanzim, and Arafat’s own police\nforce.\nThe media had changed, too, in the 13 years since the first intifada, with the rise\nof twenty-four-seven news broadcasters, including the Arabic-language Al Jazeera.\nImages of pain and suffering and fear stoked anger on both sides. None, in the first\ndays of the violence, was more powerful, or heart-rending, than the picture of a\nterrified 12-year-old Palestinian boy named Mohammed al-Durrah, sheltered by\nhis father as they took cover from the crossfire in Gaza. The facts of the incident,\nas best we could establish immediately afterwards, were that the Palestinian\nsecurity forces had opened fire on Israeli troops near the settlement of Netzarim.\nTen Palestinians, including the little boy, lost their lives when the soldiers returned\nfire. We later established with near certainty that the boy had in fact been killed by\nPalestinian gunfire. But even if we’d been able to prove that at the time, I’m sure\nthat in the increasingly poisonous atmosphere, it would have made little difference.\nNor would it have changed the next, deeply disturbing escalation: the spread of\nthe violence into Israel itself, with unprecedentedly serious clashes between our\nown Arab citizens and the police in the Galilee, in Wadi Ara, in the main mixed\nArab-Jewish cities, and the Negev. Beyond the political implications, the\ndemonstrations of solidarity with the Palestinian violence presented a security\nchallenge of a different order: to the ability of the Israeli police, and by extension\nthe government, to ensure basic law and order inside our borders. The worst of the\nclashes lasted barely a week. But they left thirteen Arab Israeli protestors dead,\nsparking demonstrations as far afield as Jaffa, as well as ugly incidents of mob\nviolence by Israeli Jews against Arabs in some areas.\nPresident Clinton tried his best to help us halt the violence on the West Bank\nand in Gaza. I doubted the Americans would succeed, but was fully ready to join in\ntheir efforts to try. About ten days into the new intifada, I attended a crisis meeting\nwith Arafat, mediated by Madeleine Albright and Dennis Ross, at the US\nambassador’s residence Paris. It was nominally under the aegis of President\n380\n/ BARAK / 95\nChirac, but the understanding was that Madeleine would be in charge. Far from\nshowing any willingness to end the violence, Arafat at first simply lied. He said the\nPalestinian violence was in response to an unprovoked assault by Israeli troops,\nand demanded an international “protection” force. There was a particularly bizarre\nmoment when I read out the names of individual Tanzim leaders whom we had\nintercepted organizing the attacks. Arafat pretended he’d never heard of any of\nthem, almost as if I was reading from a zoology textbook about species of polar\nbears. This was a man who had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. What he\nreally deserved was an Oscar.\nBut people were dying. Needlessly. We ended up agreeing to a US-led factfinding\ncommission, as well as a number of steps to separate the Palestinian\nattackers and Israeli units. I reaffirmed our policy of insisting that Israeli soldiers\nuse live fire only if they felt their lives were under threat. Arafat undertook to order\nhis security forces and Tanzim not to launch further attacks. He even phoned Gaza\nwith what we were given to understand were explicit orders. But it was all for\nshow, as we discovered when we were invited to the Elysée Palace to meet Chirac.\nThe French President had clearly received advance word from Arafat about his\ndemand for an international “protection” force, presumably with a role for the\nFrench. To my surprise and frustration, and Secretary Albright’s as well, Chirac\ninsisted that no agreement was acceptable without that happening. Then, he turned\nto me, demanding to know why the violence had left nearly 400 Palestinians dead,\nbut barely two dozen Israelis, if the Palestinians were the aggressors. “Mr\nPresident,” I said, “just several weeks ago we were prepared to go very far in order\nto put this entire conflict behind us. It is Mr Arafat who rejected the proposal, even\nas a basis for negotiations. Just a basis to seek peace. He then deliberately turned to\nterror. We are protecting ourselves, and our soldiers. Are you really saying that\nyou’ll be happy for us to sign an agreement to end it only when another 350\nIsraelis are killed? I’m not playing that game. Arafat started this. He has to stop it.\nWe know he can, and we hold him responsible if that does not happen.”\nIt did not happen. We tried all we could to prevent a further deterioration. I\napproved moves, in co-ordination with the Palestinian police, to lower our security\nprofile where possible. We made sure Israeli police were not visible from the\nmosques on the Haram al-Sharif. But after the next Friday prayers, a crowd made\nits way to a police post at the edge of the Old City and attacked it. In Nablus, the\nburial site of Joseph had long been a source of tension. Shlomo Ben-Ami reached\n381\n/ BARAK / 96\nan agreement with the Palestinians to replace an Israeli troop cordon there with\nPalestinian police. But on the morning of Saturday October 7th, hours after the\nPalestinian police took over, a mob attacked, burned and ransacked the site. They\ndestroyed the Torah scrolls. A few hours later, our soldiers found the body of a\nrabbi from a nearby settlement. He had gone to survey the damage to the\nsynagogue.\nThat evening, I delivered an ultimatum: “If we don’t see a change in the\npatterns of violence in the next two days, we will regard this as a cessation by\nArafat of the peace process.” That did, briefly, have an effect. When Clinton\nreinforced my message later in the day, Dennis told me that for the first time, he\nsensed that Arafat realized he had to act. But again, it was not enough, nor in\nanything like a sustained manner. And with an appalling act of murder three days\nafterwards, it was too late. That outrage came in Ramallah. Two Israeli reservists\ntook a wrong turn and ended up driving into the town. They were taken to the\nPalestinian police station. Hundreds of people broke in and stabbed them, gouged\ntheir eyes out and disembowled them. In a chilling image broadcast around the\nworld, one of the murderers brandished the bloodstained palms of his hands in a\ngesture of triumph. Since I was Defense Minister as well, I spent the hours that\nfollowed in the kirya. We ordered attack helicopters into action for the first time,\nthough with advance warning to local Palestinians in the areas we targeted. We\ndestroyed the Ramallah police station, as well as a militia base near Arafat’s\nheadquarters in Gaza. But Arafat emerged to tell a cheering crowd: “Our people\ndon’t care. They don’t hesitate to continue their march to Jerusalem, the capital of\nthe Palestinian independent state.”\nIsraelis did care. It is hard to say which emotion was more powerful: disgust or\nfury. But if the opinion polls were to be believed, a large majority wanted us to hit\nback with the full force of the Israeli army. Still, my overriding aim remained to\nend the violence if possible, not make it worse. When Clinton asked me to join\nhim, Arafat, King Abdullah of Jordan and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for a\nsummit in Sharm al-Sheikh, I agreed. We worked out a series of steps to\ndisengage. Arafat was finally supposed to order the Palestinian Authority security\nforces and Tanzim to cease fire, and establish no-go perimeters around our army\npositions. We would reopen Gaza airport and, over a period of two weeks, pull\nback our forces to where they had been before the violence began. But again, it\ndidn’t happen. The Palestinian attacks intensified and, as I’d made clear at the\n382\n/ BARAK / 97\nsummit, we responded. The only, brief, lull came when Arafat feared the\nAmericans would cancel his scheduled visit to Washington to see Clinton on\nNovember 9. I was due to follow him three days later.\nI met Clinton and Dennis Ross over dinner in a little kitchen area attached to the\nOval Office, and both seemed surprisingly upbeat. The President said he’d told\nArafat the broad points that would be in the new American negotiating paper. It\nwas Camp David-plus. Assuming all issues in a final peace were agreed, the\nPalestinians would now end up, after a land swap near Gaza, with a “mid-90-\npercent” share of the West Bank. On Jerusalem, the guiding principle would be\n“what is Arab will be Palestinian, and what is Jewish, Israeli.” On the Temple\nMount, the Haram al-Sharif, each side would have control of its own holy sites.\nFinally, though Palestinian refugees would be free to return in unlimited numbers\nto a new Palestinian state, there would be no “right of return” to pre-1967 Israel.\nThe President told me that after he’d run all this by Arafat, he and Dennis had\nasked whether “in principle” these were parameters he could accept. Arafat had\nsaid yes.\nI assume they expected me to say the same. But I told them I couldn’t give them\nan answer. What concerned me now was the violence. Until it was reined in, I\nwould not be party to rewarding Arafat diplomatically. I urged the Americans to\nmake ending the violence their focus as well, because if they didn’t get tougher on\nArafat’s noncompliance with anything resembling a de-escalation, Israel would do\nso.\n* * *\nSince the Knesset had returned before my trip to Washington, I’d needed first to\nmake sure my government would survive. The obvious, or at least the most\nmathematically secure, choice would have been a deal with Sharon. Especially\nsince the lynching in Ramallah, there were calls from politicians on all sides for a\nunity coalition between Labor and Likud. Arik definitely wanted in. The main\nissue reamined the peace process. I didn’t find Arik’s specific objections to Camp\nDavid hard to deal with. As I’d said from the start, the fact that we’d failed to reach\nan agreement at the summit meant that any concessions I’d considered were now,\n383\n/ BARAK / 98\nin legal and diplomatic terms, null and void. The package Arafat had ultimately\nrejected had not even been presented by me. It was an American proposal. Besides,\nit was obvious no serious negotiations were going to happen anyway for the\nforeseeable future. Arik, however, said he wanted not just a “full divorce” from\nCamp David. He insisted we formally declare an end to the entire Oslo process.\nI told him that was a price I was not prepared to pay for his support. Despite the\nfailure of the summit, and the terrible human cost from Arafat’s choice of violence\nover diplomacy, there was a wide international recognition that it was the\nPalestinians, not Israel, who were responsible. For us to end the Oslo process\nmeant inviting accusations we’d never intended to reach a peace agreement in the\nfirst place, and that it was Israel that was closing the door. We would also risk\nforfeiting the American support we’d secured by our efforts to reach a peace deal,\nan asset all Israeli governments would benefit from in other circumstances and\ncontexts in the future.\nFortunately, I had an alternative to a coalition with the Likud. Alarmed at the\nprospect of a having Sharon in the government, the Oslo-era doves in Labor, led by\nYossi Beilin, worked out a new deal with Shas. The Sephardi Orthodox party was\nstill not prepared to rejoin the cabinet, but it did promise a “safety net” in the\nKnesset to ensure we would not have to worry about no-confidence votes while\nconfronting the Palestinian violence. I knew Shas’s support would waver if there\nwas a resumption of serious peace negotiations. Still, as Clinton continued to insist\nwe make one final attempt to get a deal, I felt we had a responsibility to play our\npart. I wasn’t prepared to put us in the position of appearing to stoneweall his\nefforts, and encourage the false narrative that Israeli “intransigence” was somehow\nfrustrating Arafat’s readiness to make peace.\nThe Palestinian campaign of violence was getting worse. An Islamic Jihad car\nbomb near Mahaneh Yehudah market in Jerusalem injured nearly a dozen people\nand left two dead. Hamas blew up a school bus in one of the Gaza settlements,\nkilling two more people. In Hadera, halfway up the coast from Tel Aviv to Haifa, a\ncar bomb on a main street left two people dead and more than 60 injured.\nPalestinian snipers from near Bethlehem began opening fire on Gilo, one of the\npost-1967 Jewish suburbs of Jerusalem, and home to more than 30,000 people. Yet\ndespite all this, I authorized Shlomo Ben-Ami, Gili Sher, Amnon Lipkin and Yossi\nGinossar to continue talks with Palestinian negotiators on the terms of the\nPresident’s last-ditch peace proposal.\n384\n/ BARAK / 99\nBy the end of November, I believed that the chances of a peace agreement with\nArafat were so microscopic as to border on non-existent, and that my own\nprospects for retaining sufficient support to be an effective Prime Minister much\nbeyond Clinton’s departure were not much better. It was not just Arik and the\nLikud, but other parties on the right that were actively attempting to bring down\nthe government. I was being squeezed politically: by opposition to the concessions,\nespecially on Jerusalem, I’d been willing to consider in pursuit of a peace\nagreement, and by the ever-worsening Palestinian violence. Shlomo Ben-Ami put\nit best, saying that in the view of most Israelis, “Arafat’s response to Camp David\nwas not peace, it was an intifada.”\nBy the second part of November, there were five separate motions of noconfidence\nworking their way through the Knesset. I could have quashed them all\nat a single stroke, since Arik, both publicly and privately, was conveying to me his\ncontinuing interest in joining a unity coalition. But I again decided against it, at\nthis stage not so much because I expected a peace deal, but because I believed\ncontinued Israeli engagement in the peace process was essential to preventing\nArafat from evading his responsibility for making a deal impossible.\nI could also have wrongfooted my opponents by insisting that any early election\nbe not just for a new Prime Minister but for a new Knesset, something very few\nexisting Knesset members were anxious to see happen. I did, in fact, do precisely\nthat at the end of November, delaying an immediate move to try to topple the\ngovernment. But I immediately regretted doing it. The game-playing side of\npolitics was the part I least understood, and most disliked. I recognized that to\nbring down the Knesset along with me would be unfair to the country, not to\nmention my own Labor Party, which still had the largest number of parliamentary\nseats. In pursuing my peace efforts with Hafez al-Assad, and at Camp David, I’d\ninsisted I was acting on the mandate I’d received in the Prime Ministerial election.\nIf the peace efforts had failed, or if a significant part of the country felt I was\nwrong to have tried in the way I did, surely the responsibility for that, too, should\nfall on me.\nI remained confident I had been right to make the efforts with Arafat, with\nAssad, and, of course, to have followed through on my pledge to withdraw our\ntroops from Lebanon. But believing that you are right, even if later events might\nbear you out, was not all that mattered in politics. You had to be able to bring the\npublic with you. It was clear my support was ebbing away. Looking ahead to the\n385\n/ BARAK / 100\nchallenges Israel would face during Clinton’s final period in office and afterwards,\nI knew I could not go further without seeking a fresh mandate from the country,\nhowever unlikely the prospects now seemed.\nDeciding to do so was a decision that was probably easier for me than for other\npoliticians. Privileged though I felt as Prime Minister to be able to pursue what I\nfelt deeply were Israel’s national interests, the trappings of office were not that\nimportant to me. I’d gone into politics to do things, not for the photo opportunities.\nI did still believe it was important to see the final diplomatic push by Clinton\nthrough to its end. But I knew an early election for Prime Minister wouldn’t\nhappen overnight. It would involve a couple of months’ preparation.\n* * *\nWhen I called a news conference on December 9, the media, and the country,\nassumed that it was about the Palestinian violence and the ups and downs of the\nClinton initiative, and I did talk about both. But at the end, I said: “There are those\nwho doubt the mandate I received from the citizens of Israel. I have decided to\nseek a new mandate – to lead the state of Israel on the road to peace, security and a\nproper civic and social agenda.” I said I would go see the Israeli President the\nfollowing morning. “I will formally resign, and run for a special election, at the\nhead of the Labor Party, for the Prime Ministership of Israel.”\nThe election was set for February 2001. The last act in President Clinton’s\nattempt at a breakthrough actually came after the American election, and just a\nmonth before George W. Bush would succeed him. Since, in practical terms, any\nfinal agreement would almost certainly come under President Bush, Clinton’s final\nnegotiating paper was framed as a set of paramaters which, if agreed to by both\nsides, were intended to set the stage for a final deal. On December 23, Clinton\npresented the draft to both sides’ representatives at the White House. I wasn’t\nthere. But the accounts I got from Shlomo, Gili and Dennis Ross afterwards made\nme feel as if I was. The president said he would read through the document and\nthen leave the Israeli and Palestinian teams with Dennis to make sure they’d\nrecorded each detail. He said this was no longer the starting point for further\nargument on the basic shape of a peace deal. This was his considered judgement of\n386\n/ BARAK / 101\nwhat would constitute a fair agreement. He was presenting it on a take-it-or-leaveit\nbasis. If either side said no, he would withdraw it, and it would not be binding on\nPresident Bush.\nHe proceeded to lay out his proposal. It now envisaged the Palestinians ending\nup with between 95 and 97 percent of the West Bank. Israel’s military presence in\nthe Jordan Valley would be for a maximum of six years, after which our soldiers\nwould be replaced by an international force. On refugees, the solution Clinton\nproposed would “make it clear there is no specific right of return to Israeli itself”\nbut recognize “the aspiration of the Palestinian people to return to the area.” He\nproposed a joint endorsement by Israel and the Palestinians of the right of refugees\nto return to a new Palestinian state. In Jerusalem, Arafat would have sovereignty\nover the entirety of the Old City except for the Jewish Quarter and, of course, the\nWestern Wall and the “holy space of which it is a part.” Finally, the President said,\nthis would be a final peace: an end of conflict and, once implemented, an end to\nany further claims. He wanted replies from Israel and the Palestinians within five\ndays. Dennis added that, while both sides could come back with reservations, if\nany of these fell outside the substantive limits of President Clinton’s parameters,\nthe response would be interpreted as a “no” and our search for an agreement would\nbe over.\nClinton’s latest proposals went beyond even what I was willing to have him\nkeep in his pocket at Camp David. Opposition politicians in Israel, and even a few\nof our cabinet ministers, promptly objected to the formula for Jerusalem. I told the\ncritics – as I knew I’d have to argue to the country in a referendum, in the\nvanishingly unlikely event we actually reached an agreeement – that making peace\nwas not like making love. It was something you did with enemies. I, too, would\nhave preferred to say no to Clinton’s ideas on Jerusalem. But to reject them would\nhave placed Israel in the position of rejecting the entire Clinton paper, something I\nwas not prepared to do.\nI sent word to the President that we accepted his ideas. We did raise\nreservations – twenty-eight in all, about how various parts of the agreement would\nwork on the ground. But none fell outside his parameters for a peace agreement. At\nfirst Arafat asked the Americans for more time. Then he went to Washington to see\nClinton. There, he presented his “reservations”. They were not just outside the\nClinton parameters. They rejected two key elements. Arafat said there could be no\n387\n/ BARAK / 102\nIsraeli sovereignty over the Western Wall of the ancient temple. Nor would he\nagree to any compromise on the “right of return.”\nFor me, that was the final answer. As one Palestinian leader remarked to me\namid the still-escalating terror attacks a couple of years later, the Palestinians had\n“needed a Ben-Gurion, but we got an Arafat.” He didn’t mean Ben-Gurion the\nZionist, but the statesman who at crucial moments like the partition vote in 1947,\ncould give up his maximalist hopes and dreams in order to secure a better future\nfor his people. Arafat felt much more comfortable, more secure, when the suicide\nbombers were calling the tune. Then he could whip up the crowds with promises of\n“marching on Jerusalem” or jet around the world telling everyone that Israel was\ndenying his right to a state.\n* * *\nThough I now knew an agreement was impossible, for many on the Israeli left,\nmy ostensible allies in the forthcoming election campaign against Arik, that was\nhard to accept. Particularly for Yossi Sarid of Meretz, and to a certain extent Yossi\nBeilin too, the only explanation for our failure to get a deal had to be that we\nhadn’t negotiated well or creatively enough. The idea that Arafat simply didn’t\nwant a two-state peace was anathema to them. So was the political platform I said\nthat I hoped to implement if I was re-elected as Prime Minister. Maybe, at some\npoint in the future, a negotiated peace might be possible. We had accomplished\nsomething of importance at Camp David. We’d made clear our red lines. We knew\nwhere Arafat stood. But for now, I believed we had to move on, both in order to\nkeep the situation on the ground from getting worse and to act in Israel’s own longterm\npolitical and security interests. I said we should unilaterally disengage from\nthe West Bank and Gaza.\nThe idea was straightforward. The Palestinians’ unwillingness to accept even\nthe final Clinton parameters, driven home with murderous ferocity by the\nexplosion of violence since Camp David, should not be allowed to paralyze Israel\npolitically. I proposed that we map out the area we required to retain and secure the\nmajor settlement blocs, as well as the outer East Jerusalem suburbs; a further\nsecurity strip along the Jordan River; and several other strategically important\n388\n/ BARAK / 103\npoints. It would amount to retaining control over around 20 percent of the West\nBank, but none of the major Arab towns or cities. Though deliberately stopping\nwell short of share of the West Bank Arafat could have secured through a\nnegotiated peace, it would remove Israeli troops and settlers from most of the\nterritory. It would give the Palestinians ample room to set up a state if they so\nchose, and conceivably to expand its area if some future leader had more of the\n“Ben-Gurion” in him than Arafat. Until then, it would allow both of our peoples to\nget on with their lives and focus on their own political and social and economic\nchallenges.\nThere was a second, critically important part to what I was proposing: the\nconstruction of a physical security fence along the new “disengagement line” with\nthe West Bank. It was the suggestion rejected under Rabin, accepted under Peres\namid the Hamas bombings in the 1996 election campaign, but never followed\nthrough on. Even under the new arrangement I envisaged, Israeli troops would\nretain the freedom of action to respond to, or pre-empt, terror attacks with targeted\noperations inside the West Bank. But the physical barrier would hugely increase\nour ability to halt the attackers before they could strike.\nYet even if I’d been able to bring those on the left of Labor behind the plan, this\nelection campaign was going to be a lot tougher than in 1999. Since Knesset\nmembers weren’t running for their seats, the Labor machine lacked its usual\nincentive put up posters, knock on doors, or get out the vote. Arik, however,\nbenefited from the enthusiasm of Likudniks and other right-wing activists who saw\nan opportunity to retake control of Israel’s political agenda.\nLong before election day, I realized my time as Prime Minister was up. Before\nthe campaign began, an old friend of mine, a leading Israeli journalist, tried to talk\nme into withdrawing. “You’re going to lose, Ehud,” he said. “Why, after making\nall this effort for peace, after doing your best, do you want the last act to be losing\nto Arik?” I’d never seen the objective as just staying in office. If that had been the\ncase, I wouldn’t have put the chances of a peace deal with Syria to their final test. I\nwouldn’t have gone to Camp David. I also would have accepted Arik’s serial\noffers to join a unity coalition. But never in my life had I walked away from a\nchallenge. I certainly wasn’t going to retreat in the midst of Palestinian violence,\nand when Israel still faced key decisions on how to move on from Arafat’s\nunreadiness to negotiate an end to our decades-old conflict.\n389\n/ BARAK / 104\nI did regret being unable to rely on the support of two key constituencies that\nhad helped deliver my landslide victory barely 18 months earlier: my own Labor\nParty and the Arab citizens of Israel. I had no trouble understanding the reasons\nmany Israeli Arabs were abandoning me. The clashes in the Galilee at the start of\nthe new intifada had left more than a dozen of their community dead. As an official\ninquiry would later conclude, there was blame on all sides. A number of Arab\nmembers of the Knesset had played a part in inciting the violence. Yet the police\nhad been unprepared, and they had used excessive force. As I said publicly before\nthe election, I, as Prime Minister, was ultimately responsible, and I formally\napologized for what had happened. Yet the roots went deeper, to the economic and\nsocial disadvantages still faced by many Arab citizens, and the difficulty in\nresolving those problems calmly and collectively as long as Israel remained in a\nstate of war with its Arab neighbors.\nFor Labor and the political left, it was as if, despite Arafat’s repeated rejections\nof ever more forthcoming terms of peace, they still couldn’t bring themselves to\nbelieve he really meant it. By default, they were inclined to blame me for not\ndelivering peace. I was accused of relying too much on a close circle of aides and\nnegotiators I’d known from my time in the army, of not giving a negotiating role to\nLabor veterans of the Oslo negotiations like Yossi Beilin, and of being\ninsufficiently sensitive to Arafat’s needs in the negotiating process. Typical of the\nargument was a broadside by the journalist and historian Tom Segev, in Ha’aretz,\nwhich accused me of an “incredible arrogance” which had “led to an historic\nmistake. Rather than continue on the Oslo road, Barak put it into his head that he\ncould reach a final settlement and try and impose it on the Palestinian Authority\nPresident.” I did not try to “impose” anything on Arafat. I did, quite consciously,\nabandon the “Oslo road” because it was inexorably leading to a situation where,\nafter the final Wye redeployments, Arafat would have control over the great\nmajority of the West Bank without having to commit to any of the assurances that\neven most on the Israeli left would define as the minimum required for peace.\nNow, of course, we knew that was something the Palestinian leader was not\nprepared to do.\nWhen election day came, not that many of my critics on the left actually voted\nagainst me. Nor did the Israeli Arabs. Yet in very large numbers, they simply\ndidn’t vote. In percentage terms, Arik’s victory was even more decisive than mine\nover Bibi. He got more than 62 percent of the vote. I received barely 37 percent.\n390\n/ BARAK / 105\nYet the turnout was the lowest in Israeli history. Arik received fewer votes than I\nhad in 1999. Around half of the 1.8 million people who had supported me stayed at\nhome.\nI conceded defeat after the first exit polls and said I would be stepping down as\nhead of the Labor Party. Still, since the election had been only for Prime Minister,\nLabor remained the largest party in the Knesset. Mathematically, Arik might be\nable to cobble together the required 61-seat majority with an assortment of smaller\nparties. But without Labor as ballast, his government would be even more\nprecarious than mine. When I triggered the election, he’d let it be known that if he\nwon, he hoped to include Labor in his government, with me as his Defense\nMinister. Even though I’d announced I was stepping aside, he phoned me the\nmorning after the election to make that argument again. He said Israel needed a\nstrong government, especially to confront the escalating violence. Having a person\nwith my background, whom he knew well and trusted, in the defense portfolio was\nimportant. I didn’t say yes. Unfortunately, I failed to do what I should have done: I\ndidn’t immediately say no.\nWhen the public learned about Sharon’s interest in a unity government, Labor\ndescended into bickering. Some of my former ministers, like Yossi Beilin and\nShlomo Ben-Ami, were against the idea of joining any Likud-led government.\nThey were especially disgusted by the prospect of doing so under Arik, the\narchitect of the 1982 Lebanon War. Most of the Labor’s central committee did\nseem in favor of joining. But given the scale of my election defeat, many wanted\ndo so without me. For a few days, Arik kept phoning me. I did feel that the\nsubstance of the arrangement he suggested made sense. But over that first week, I\nrealized that, understandably, he had little interest in addressing my policy\nconcerns. I decided to focus instead on ensuring a properly organized transition to\na new Labor party leader, and publicly confirmed that I would indeed be resigning.\nSeveral weeks after Arik formed his government – including Labor, with Simon\nPeres as one of four deputy prime ministers – he invited me to his office. He\nwanted to ask my views on a specific security question. That took barely 15\nminutes. But I raised another issue that I argued would have more far-reaching\nimplications. It was the idea of building the security fence along the West Bank.\nI’d tried to make the case for doing so during the election campaign, and I’d lost\nthe election. “Now I’m turning to you. When I left office, 39 Israelis had been\nkilled in the terror attacks. Now, there are 70. When the number reaches 700,\n391\n/ BARAK / 106\nthere’s no doubt you’ll decide to build this fence. But to your dying day, you won’t\nbe able to look yourself in the mirror and explain why you waited for another 630\nIsraelis to die first.”\nHe did eventually start building it, but only in the wake of an act of terrorism\nwhich, even by the standards of this new and still-escalating intifada, was truly\nobscene. In March 2002, suicide bombers murdered 30 people, mostly elderly, as\nthey were celebrating the annual Passover Seder in a hotel dining room in Netanya.\nArik hit back two days later with Israel’s largest military operation on the West\nBank since 1967. Israeli forces retook major Palestinian towns, placed Arafat\nunder de facto siege in his headquarters in Ramallah and imposed curfews and\nclosures. In June, the government formally approved the security fence. Still,\nanother year would pass before the major part of the barrier was in place, by which\ntime some 500 Israelis had been murdered in the terror attacks. Only then did the\nnumber of casualties begin to fall.\nI tried to steer clear of public criticism of Arik’s government. One of the lessons\nI’d learned as Prime Minister was how easy it was to second-guess from the\noutside. No Prime Minister can act exactly as he might plan or want to. The most\nyou can do is make sure you understand and analyze the issues and follow your\ninstincts, experience and conscience to come as near as possible to doing what you\nbelieve is right. You will inevitably make mistakes and misjudgements. I certainly\ndid. At least some of the criticism I received was deserved. I was at times too\ninflexible. I tended to limit my focus to a small group of trusted aides and advisors.\nI was less good at schmoozing with – or, perhaps more importantly, delegating to –\nothers in the government or the party. I suspect it’s no coincidence that the man\nwho brought me into government in the first place was often criticized for the same\nthings. By character, instinct and experience, Rabin, too, remained less a politician\nthan a military man. Yet towards the end of his second period as Prime Minister,\nhe did get better at delegating to people around him, and creating an atmosphere\nthat encouraged teamwork, even when he knew he could not accept or act on\neverything they might suggest. During my term as Prime Minister, I was much less\ngood at that.\nBut another thing Yitzhak and I shared was a determination to set ourselves\nspecific goals and do everything we could to achieve them. I promised to get the\narmy out of Lebanon. With the Palestinians, I arrived in office convinced that the\nprocess begun in Oslo was both a huge opportunity and a potential dead-end. I was\n392\n/ BARAK / 107\ndetermined to focus on the end goal: initially, at least, a framework agreement, and\nover time a final political resolution of our conflict. Ever since the outbreak of the\nPalestinians’ first intifada, I believed this was as much in Israel’s own interest as\ntheirs. Yet when I entered office, we had no way of knowing whether Arafat\nwanted two states living side-by-side in peace. I felt it was my duty to find out,\nand, if the answer was yes, to put a peace agreement in place. I felt the same about\nway about Syria and Hafez al-Assad.\nWhen I left office, I believed I had achieved the most important goals of my\npremiership. We were out of Lebanon. Though we couldn’t achieve the peace\nagreements I had hoped for, it was not for lack of trying. Along the way, Israel had\ndemonstrated to the world that it was able and willing to consider painful\ncompromises, and that it was the Arab leaders who, at least for now, were unequal\nto the challenge of making peace. If I’d been able to retain the backing of the\nvoters who made me Prime Minister in 1999, we might even have moved ahead on\nunilateral disengagement from the Palestinians, dramatically altering the trajectory\nof our relationship. Yet even without that, Camp David did delineate the terms of\nany future peace arrangement. When and if conditions allowed a resumption of\nserious negotiating efforts, the shape, and indeed most of the details, of a final\npeace between our peoples were now clear.\nI was on holiday in the summer of 2001 when Clinton phoned me. The New\nTimes had run a piece on how and why the summit, and the subsequent\nnegotiations through the end of the year, ended in failure. When I later read the\narticle, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Deborah Sontag, I found it a\nmeandering mix of opinions garnered from an assortment of Americans,\nEuropeans, Israelis and Palestinians, including Arafat himself, with the overall\nconclusion that Clinton and I had not offered as generous a deal as was assumed\nand that it was somehow unfair to suggest the Palestinians deserved blame for\nrejecting it. There had been several other articles in various publications along the\nsame lines. I didn’t see much point at this stage in setting the record straight. To\nthe extent the content of the Times piece bothered me, it was a simple, but\nimportant, error of fact. Quoting Arafat himself, Sontag wrote that during the backpatio\ndiscussion I had with him at the dinner in Kochav Yair shortly before the new\nintifada, he’d “implored me to block Mr Sharon’s plans” to visit the Temple\nMount. Arafat didn’t raise the issue at all, and presumably knew that we had\nconsulted his West Bank security chief to ensure it happened quickly, avoided the\n393\n/ BARAK / 108\nmosques on the Haram, and would not become a catalyst, or in this case a pretext,\nfor violence.\nYet the revisionist history about our peace efforts left Clinton not just\nfrustrated, but genuinely puzzled. What the hell were these people talking about, he\nasked me. Why were they missing the forest for the trees. “The true story of Camp\nDavid,” he said, “was that for the first time in the history of the conflict, you and I,\nthe Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the United States, placed on the\ntable a proposal, based on Resolutions 242 and 338, very close to the Palestinian\ndemands. And Arafat refused to accept it as a basis of negotiations, walked out of\nthe room, and deliberately turned to terrorism.” All the rest, President Clinton said,\nwas gossip.\nAll of it was now irrelevant, too. His parameters were off the table. Palestinian\nviolence against Israelis was getting ever deadlier. And I was out of politics. When\nI delivered my final remarks to a Labor Party meeting, I was asked whether I was\nleaving politics for good. I replied that I would always remain a member of Labor.\nBut I saw my role as a bit like when I’d left the army. “I’m a reserve officer,” I\nsaid, adding that I hoped I would not be called back to duty any time soon.\nI had been Prime Minister for only 21 months. But I’d been in politics for six\nyears, and in uniform for nearly thirty-six: in public service for more than four\ndecades. Now, suddenly, I was a private citizen. And for a few years, I actually\nstayed that way.\n394\n/ BARAK / 109\nChapter Twenty-Four\nI had only a general idea of what I would do next. “Something in business”\ndescribes it best. But I sought the advice of a friend who, rather than leaving\npolitics, had just entered it. Colin Powell was now the second President Bush’s\nSecretary of State. “Why don’t you go on the lecture circuit?” he said. The short\nanswer was that it hadn’t occurred to me that I’d be any good at it. But it proved\nenergizing and interesting both for me and, it seemed, the audiences I spoke to. It\nwas also lucrative. I would deliver four lectures over the span of a week and end up\nmaking twice what, until that point in my life, I had earned during a full year. I was\nalso invited onto a number of company boards. I turned down some, in order to\navoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. But I did get involved in an area\nwhere I believed my range of experiences might be relevant: investment decisions,\nand venture capital.\nThe result was a dramatic change in lifestyle. Nava and I got to spend more\ntime with our daughters. We vacationed overseas for the first time. We also\ndecided to build a new home, and the place that we chose gave me my first\nexperience of how far I was from being a “private citizen” in the eyes of the Israeli\npublic. When it became known we were planning to move to Kfar Shmaryahu near\nTel Aviv, one of the wealthiest places in Israel, all hell broke loose. How could\nyou, I was asked. I couldn’t resist joking that I just wanted to be close to our\nvoters. Likud supporters were about as rare in Kfar Shmaryahu as panhandlers.\nAlong with Mishmar Hasharon, it was the only place where I’d polled over 80\npercent even in my loss to Sharon.\nIsrael had changed dramatically from the kibbutz-centered pioneer society of\nmy youth. Greater Tel Aviv, in particular, was thriving economically, and the\nrising crop of millionaires, whether from traditional business or in the bourgeoning\ntechnology sector, included its fair share of former kibbutznikim. Still, socially and\nculturally, a puritanical streak remained, a sense that there was something not quite\nright about people raised on a socialist ideal becoming personally well off. I\naccepted this. I recognized that I was not just a former kibbutznik. I had been head\nof the Labor Party. And Prime Minister. Still, I did feel much of the personal\ncriticism was unfair. I had devoted more than four decades of my life to serving\nmy country. I’d behaved with scrupulous honesty while in office, and was avoiding\n395\n/ BARAK / 110\nany business involvement that could present a conflict of interest now that I had\nleft. Frankly, I saw nothing wrong with earning money through honest endeavor,\nand using the proceeds to provide economic security for myself and my family,\nand to give our grandchildren a better start in life than Nava’s or my own parents\nhad been able to do.\nIn the end, we didn’t move to Kfar Shmaryahu. But that was because of an even\nmore profound change in my life: I separated from Nava, after more than 30 years\ntogether. When we had begun plans to move, I laughed off a warning from a\npsychologist friend of mine that decisions like building a new house could lead to a\ndeeper reassessment of your life. But that is at least in part what happened. There\nwere also other changes that caused me to stop and take stock. I was no longer\nPrime Minister. My father had passed away soon after I left office. Professionally,\nI was exploring new areas and developing new interests. Nava and I had been\nhappily married since our twenties. We had three wonderful daughters, and a first\ngrandchild. Yet the more I thought about where we were in our lives, the more I\nfelt our future paths were pulling us in different directions. For both of us, the\nseparation was difficult, though it was made a bit less painful because Nava knew\nthat it had nothing to do with another woman, or another relationship. I did\nimagine that I might one day meet someone else. But I was equally prepared for it\nnot happening. I certainly didn’t expect it any time soon.\nWhen it did, it began by accident. A few weeks after our separation, I was\nvisiting the Knesset for a discussion about fixing Israel’s broken electoral system.\nIn the audience was a member of one of the civic associations pressing for reform:\nNili Priell, my first, and only, serious girlfriend before I met Nava. We spoke for a\nfew minutes afterwards. We agreed to meet again, and catch up with each other’s\nlives, a week or so later. Both of us now had grown children. We were both on our\nown. There is, I assume for everyone, something impossible to replicate about a\nfirst love. Nili and I were given an unlikely second chance. That seemed to me an\nextraordinary gift. It still does.\nYet if my personal life seemed full of new promise, the same could not be said\nof the country I’d served for my whole adult life, or of the political party I’d led\ninto government. The continuing construction of the security fence along the West\nBank finally did begin to reduce the sheer number of Palestinian attacks: from\nnearly 50 in 2002, to about half that number in 2003. But the suicide bombers who\ndid get through – from Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah’s “Al-Aqsa Martyrs’\n396\n/ BARAK / 111\nBrigade” – struck wherever they could inflict the most terror, and death: at bus\nstations, on buses, in shopping centers, restaurants and cafés. Over a 12-month\nperiod, beginning with a bombing of Tel Aviv’s main bus station at the beginning\nof January 2003, they murdered 145 men, women and children. It would not be\nuntil two years’ later, with the West Bank fence in place and a range of other\nsecurity measures, that the attacks, and the deaths, were finally brought down\ndramatically.\nThe Labor Party had finally left Arik Sharon’s coalition in late 2002. But in\nIsrael’s 2003 election – reverting to the old rules again, with a single vote for party\nand Prime Minister – Arik and the Likud won resoundingly. They doubled their\nKnesset seats, to 38. Labor, now with only 19 seats, against turned to Shimon\nPeres, as interim party leader.\nI didn’t miss the political limelight. But by mid-2004, with the first sign of a\nmajor change in policy toward the Palestinians, I felt I had a contribution to make.\nWhat first prompted me to dip my toes back into politics were the ever more\nobvious signs throughout 2004 that Arik’s coalition, and his hold on the Likud,\nwere unraveling. Part of his problem was a steady drumbeat of corruption\nallegations around what had become a kind of family political operation: Arik and\nhis two sons, Omri and Gilad. But Arik also seemed to be undergoing a welcome\npolitical conversion, to the need for the more profound political “disengagement”\nwith the Palestinians which I’d long been advocating. He had endorsed the Bush\nAdministration’s “road map” for resuming the peace process. Yet with Yasir\nArafat ageing, ailing and even less inclined to consider the difficult decisions he\nhad shirked at Camp David, Arik went one, dramatic step further. He raised the\nidea of unilaterally withdrawing Israeli forces and settlements from Gaza –\nensuring a showdown with the rank and file of the Likud, and other parties on the\nright. His main Likud rival, very much back in front-line Israeli politics, was his\nFinance Minister: Bibi Netanyahu. Though Bibi remained on board until the last\nmoment, he dramatically resigned for the cabinet in August 2005, a week before\nthe Gaza withdrawal, declaring: “I am not prepared to be a partner to a move\nwhich ignores reality, and proceeds blindly toward turning the Gaza Strip into a\nbase for Islamic terrorism which will threaten the state.”\nTo this day, Bibi, along with many Israelis across the political spectrum, draws\na direct line between our pullout from Gaza, Hamas’s takeover and its violent\npurging of Fatah’s old guard there, and the periodic wars we’ve had to fight since\n397\n/ BARAK / 112\nthen in response to Hamas rocket fire into Israel. The moral: Arik was wrong to\nwithdraw. But the Islamists’ ascendancy was happening anyway. After all, it was\nHamas attacks that provided the spearhead of the intifada of terror launched in the\nwake of Camp David. Arafat’s own influence was also inexorably on the wane by\nthe time he passed away, in Paris, at the end of 2004, to be succeeded by Abu\nMazen. I do not know of a single senior figure in Israel with any military\nexperience who believes that we would be more secure today if we still had\nthousands of soldiers and settlers inside Gaza. Surprised though I was by Arik’s\ndecision to leave, I had no doubt that the fundamental security judgment he was\nmaking – that a disengagement was in Israel’s own interest – was the right one. I\nwas encouraged, too, by his parallel announcement of a small, token withdrawal\nfrom a few small West Bank settlements. My regret at the time was that he did not\ngo further toward the kind of major West Bank disengagement I’d been arguing\nfor, and that even in Gaza the pullout seemed insufficiently prepared or thought\nout. The model, I believed, should have been our withdrawal from Lebanon –\ninvolving detailed prior consultation with, and political support from, the UN and\nkey international allies. I also felt it was critically important to ensure that, while\nwe would obviously need offshore patrols to prevent arms and munitions from\ngetting in, we allowed and encouraged an environment in which the Gazan\neconomy could function and grow after we left. None of that happened. Though we\nleft Gaza, we effectively sealed off and blockaded one of the most densely\npopulated, economically strapped and politically febrile strips of land on the face\nof the earth.\nStill, I did see it as an important first step toward the kind of wider\ndisengagement that would prioritize Israel’s own security interests, and political\nand social cohesiveness, until and unless conditions allowed a for a serious new\neffort for a final peace deal. I was heartened when Shimon led Labor back into\nArik’s coalition at the start of 2005 to ensure he’d have the support necessary to go\nthrough with the Gaza withdrawal. And while I did make a brief attempt to return\nas party leader later in the year, when it was clear I wasn’t going to win, I threw\nmy support behind Shimon and against the other challenger, the longtime laborunion\nleader Amir Peretz, who was running on a platform to take Labor out of\nSharon’s government.\nBut Peretz won the leadership election. He did leave the cabinet, forcing Arik to\ncall an early election for March 2006. And that, along with the most ambitious and\n398\n/ BARAK / 113\nill-fated Israeli war in Lebanon since 1982, was the reason I ultimately found\nmyself back in the Israeli government.\n* * *\nIt began on July 12, 2006, when Hizbollah fired rockets from southern Lebanon\nas cover for an ambush of two Israeli Humvees on our side of the border. Two\nsoldiers were killed, and two others abducted. A few hours later, when an Israeli\narmored unit crossed to look for the kidnapped soldiers, an explosive charge blew\nup one of our tanks, killing four of its crew members.\nArik was no longer Prime Minister by then. With Bibi marshalling opposition\ninside the Likud to the Gaza disenagegment, he had formed a new centrist party\ncalled Kadima, along with prominent Likud moderates and buttressed by a Labor\nheavyweight: Shimon Peres. But before the election, Arik suffered a pair of\nstrokes, lapsing into a coma from which he would never emerge. His notional\ndeputy, the veteran Likud politician and former Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert,\nfound himself as Prime Minister. Kadima did comfortably win the May election. It\nended up with 29 seats, followed by Labor with 19 and leaving the Netanyahu-led\nLikud with only 12. Olmert formed a coalition, including Labor, which had\nundeniable political ballast: Shimon was one of his deputy Prime Ministers, along\nwith Haim Ramon. The gifted lawyer, longtime Likudnik and strong backer of the\nGaza plan, Tzipi Livni, was Foreign Minister. Amir Peretz, as head of Labor, was\ngiven the Defense Ministry. But without Sharon himself at the helm, the\ngovernment was now about to face a military crisis with virtually no military\nexperience around the cabinet table.\nOlmert called an emergency cabinet meeting on the evening of the Hizbollah\nattack, and just before it was due to convene, my phone rang. It was Shimon, who,\nthough with no first-hand army experience, did at least have the political\nexperience in war that none of Olmert’s other ministers could offer. He’d been by\nBen-Gurion’s side during the 1956 war, had been in Golda’s government in 1967,\nand was Defense Minister after the 1973 war, through Entebbe, until Begin’s\ndefeated Labor in the 1977 election. Despite our own battles inside Labor, Shimon\nand I had become closer again of late, especially after I’d supported him in his last\n399\n/ BARAK / 114\nLabor leadership contest. “Shalom, Ehud,” he said when I answered the phone and,\nwithout small talk or preliminaries, asked me: “What do you think we should do?”\nI said I couldn’t offer specific suggestions. “It’s a detail-related question, and I\ndon’t know the details.” But I advised him on the process I felt would be needed to\ncome up with the right answer when the chief-of-staff, the former air force chief\nDan Halutz, briefed the cabinet. “Halutz will propose what to do. Push him,” I\nsaid. “When he presents his recommended action, ask him for his assessment of\nwhat Hizbollah will do in response. When he, or the head of military intelligence,\nhas given you the range of possibilities and told you which is the most likely, say,\nOK, let’s assume that happens. What’s our next step? How is that going to lead us\nto our main objectives? And what are the objectives?” Newspaper reports the next\nmorning said that Shimon, and only Shimon, did indeed press the chief-of-staff\nabout each further stage of the operation and about the aims that we wanted to\naccomplish. But Halutz finally fobbed him off by saying that once they got to the\nlater phases, they could discuss it.\nFrom the first reports I received through my army contacts, I feared the\noperation would go badly. There was no doubt we could inflict damage on\nHizbollah. But there were no clear answers to the questions Shimon had raised.\nThe initial Israeli air force response had been put in place more than five years\nearlier, when I was Prime Minister. Codenamed “Operation Cinnamon Sticks,” it\nwas designed to take out all of the fixed Hizbollah missile sites we had been able\nto identify. We knew its limitations. A lot of the rockets were fired from mobile\nlaunchers. But in one exercise, the known “Hizbollah” sites were replicated in the\nGalilee. They were destroyed in 43 minutes. I had no doubt that part of the plan\nwould succeed. In the early hours of July 13, it took only 34 minutes to destroy the\nnearly 60 launchers we had pinpointed over the previous five years.\nBut Operation Cinnamon Sticks had been intended as a first step in a far wider\nassault on Hizbollah and other targets, including a number of infrastructure\ninstallations, deeper inside Lebanon. It was part of a plan for a full-scale war, if the\ngovernment decided that was necessary. As the early public statements by Olmert\nand other ministers made clear, they did not intend to start a war, at least at the\noutset. They certainly didn’t have a coherent plan for one. But they would soon\nfind themselves in Israel’s longest single armed conflict since 1948. When\nHizbollah fired hundreds of missiles at Israeli towns and cities, our operation\nintensified not by plan or military logic, but improvisation. As a former Prime\n400\n/ BARAK / 115\nMinister, I felt it was not my place to criticize Olmert publicly when Israeli troops\nwere in action. Two days in, in fact, I told a television interviewer that the\ngovernment had every right to respond and was doing so effectively. Olmert\nphoned to thank me. When he, like Shimon, asked what I thought the government\nshould do next, I was straightforward: “Do your best to bring things to an end as\nsoon as you can.” I said that Halutz and the other generals would be caught up in\nthe operational details, which made his role and that of the cabinet even more\ncritical. “In any operation, you’ll have an idea about what represents a satisfactory\nexit point. But there will be a temptation, when you get close to that point, to take\njust one more step, to keep going until you’re absolutely sure you’ve reached it.”\nResist that temptation, I told him. I said there was a danger that, before they knew\nit, he and the other minister would be in way over their heads.\nIn pure military terms, there were just two realistic choices in responding the\nHibzollah attack: a deliberately limited and fairly brief operation, or a full-scale\nwar. We ended up doing neither. The result was an operation that lasted 34 days,\nnearly twice the length of the Yom Kippur War. Our air force flew 12,000\nmissions, more than in 1973 and nearly twice as many as in the 1982 Lebanon\nWar. Hizbollah fired about 4,000 rockets into Israel – from a stockpile we\nestimated to number nearly 20,000 – and not just at the border settlements but as\nfar south as Hadera and Haifa, keeping hundreds of thousands of Israelis under\neffective siege. More than 120 Israeli soldiers and 44 civilians were killed. So were\nhundreds of Hizbollah fighters and, inevitably, many Lebanese civilians as well,\nwith a predictable surge of criticism from much of the outside world. Only\nPresident Bush and Britain’s Tony Blair steadfastly reminded the critics of how the\nwar had actually begun.\nThe one putative victory for Israel was the UN cease-fire resolution that Tzipi\nLivni helped to negotiate in August. At least on paper, it contained a commitment\nto a “long-term solution” including the disarmament of Hizbollah and the\n“unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, which has given rise to the\ncurrent crisis.” But as Israeli newspapers began speaking to the returning soldiers\nand officers, a picture emerged not just of a long and difficult war, but a lack of\nclearly communicated military objectives, and an often-chaotic chain of command,\nwhich ended up costing Israeli lives. Our final advance, alone, shortly before the\ncease-fire, claimed the lives of some 30 soldiers. And for what, many Israelis were\nsoon asking themselves. One of the newspapers most supportive of the operation at\n401\n/ BARAK / 116\nthe beginning summed up the feeling of most of the country at the end: “If you\ndon’t win, you lose... Hizbollah survived. It won the war.”\nWithout the botched handling of the war, I might well have remained a mere\nmember of the Labor Party and a private citizen. But when the commission of\ninquiry released its report in April 2007, three people were singled out: Olmert,\nAmir Peretz and Halutz. Olmert was portrayed as a military novice who’d gone\ninto battle without understanding the wartime role and responsibilities of a Prime\nMinister. Halutz’s “excess of charisma” was held responsible for keeping\nministers, and military officers as well, from questioning his judgement or pressing\nhim for alternatives. Amir Peretz was found to be the wrong man in the wrong\ncabinet post at the wrong time. Of the three, only Halutz seemed ready to take\npersonal responsibility. Even before the report came out, he resigned. Olmert and\nPeretz were determined to stay put, despite calls to quit not just from the\nopposition but from Tzipi Livni. Inside Labor as well, the war produced a clamor\nfor change. When a vote for party chairman was held in June 2007, I was chosen to\nreturn in Peretz’s place.\nWithin days, I replaced him as Defense Minister as well. Yet the main item in\nmy in-box would no longer be Lebanon. I had been briefed a few weeks earlier by\nOlmert on a threat hundreds of miles further away: a construction site in northeast\nSyria, along the Euphrates River, where Mossad had uncovered evidence that the\nSyrians, with technical help from North Korea and funding from Iran, were\nbuilding a nuclear reactor.\n* * *\nI had got to know Olmert fairly well over the years, initially when I was in the\nkirya and both he and another rising Likud politician to whom I became closer,\nDan Meridor, were members of the Knesset’s defense committee. But from the day\nI returned to the Israeli government in June 2007, there was growing tension\nbetween us over dealing with the Syrian nuclear threat. It was not about whether\nwe should take military action to destroy the reactor, before the fuel rods arrived\non site and it could begin producing bomb-ready material. Just as under Menachem\nBegin in 1981, when we’d launched our preemptive strike on Saddam Hussein’s\n402\n/ BARAK / 117\nreactor near Baghdad, there was never any question that we would take any and all\npossible measures to prevent Syria from getting a nuclear weapon. An immutable,\ncore assumption in Israel’s security strategy was the need to retain our ability to\ndeter, and if necessary defeat, our enemies. A nuclear Syria – or Iraq, or Iran –\nwould dramatically alter the balance of power in the region, at obvious risk to\nIsrael. Syria posed a particular threat, as part of an increasingly close alliance with\nIran, and with Hizbollah in Lebanon.\nThe question, however, was how and when to strike the reactor. Olmert wanted\nto attack within days. He seemed to assume that, as a former chief of staff, I’d nod\nenthusiastically and go along with him. I did understand the reasons for his sense\nof urgency. Not only did we have to make sure we attacked before the fuel was on\nsite. There was always the risk the Syrians would find out that we were aware of\ntheir nuclear facility, putting them on even higher alert. But the operational\nchallenge was complex. We need a fail-safe plan to destroy the reactor. We had to\ndo it in such a way as to avoid a full-scale military confrontation with Syria if\npossible. And we had to ensure we were ready for that, if it did happen. It took\nvery little time for me to realize that none of those prerequisites was yet in place.\nNot unlike the recent Lebanon war, we were choosing between two off-the-shelf\nplans from the kirya. One involved using a large military force, and would almost\ncertainly draw us into a major conflict with Syria. The other was a smaller,\ntargeted operation. But it remained untested, and there was no certainty it would\nactually destroy the reactor.\nOver the next few months, Olmert got more and more frustrated with the fact\nwe hadn’t yet attacked, and frustrated with me as well. We held dozens of\nmeetings, sometimes two or three a day, chaired by the Prime Minister, sometimes\nby me as Defense Minister, or by the chief of staff or service commanders.\nInvariably, I began my remarks by saying: “We have to destroy the reactor.” This\nwas not because I felt that any of us seriously doubted that. It was because Olmert\nwas beginning to suggest to the few ministers and senior officers aware of our\nplanning that I was against attacking the reactor. In fact, I was working with the\nmilitary and Mossad to ensure we had a plan that would succeed, with the\nminimum possible risk of drawing us into a major clash with the Syrians after the\nfacility was destroyed. I was also working – with the help of the Americans – to\nmake sure we could get the forces and munitions in place in the north of Israel to\n403\n/ BARAK / 118\ndeal with a major conflict with the Syrians. All of this, under a tight seal of\nsecrecy.\nFinally, in early September 2007, everything was in place. Olmert briefed the\ncabinet, and secured the ministers’ approval to destroy the reactor, with the\nunderstanding that the precise timing of the operation would now be left to the\nPrime Minister, the Defense Minister and the Foreign Minister: Olmert, me and\nTzipi Livni. The three of us met immediately after the cabinet discussion. Olmert\nargued that the risk of leaks justified attacking that night, and I agreed with him.\nTzipi was reluctant, but Olmert turned to her and said: “Are you sure you’re\ncomfortable with an attack being ordered by me and Barak, while you chose to\nabstain?” She thought it over, and added her approval.\nWe struck just after midnight, in an intricately coordinated air attack that\nevaded not only a Syrian response, but Syrian notice. The reactor was destroyed.\nAlthough even today the exact details remain subject to Israel’s military secrecy\nregulations, accounts published abroad in the weeks and months that followed\npainted a surprisingly accurate picture, including the pioneering use of electronic\nwarfare capabilities to deal with risk of radar detection. But in the immediate\naftermath of the attack, Israel deliberately made no public comment. We refused to\nsay whether we’d had anything to do with an attack. As we he had hoped, this\nallowed the Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, both the space and a good reason to\ndeny that it had ever happened, deny that he’d been trying to make a nuclear\nweapon, and thus feel no compelling reason to retaliate.\n* * *\nThe reactor operation, however, marked the start of an increasingly tough\nperiod in both my and Tzipi’s relationship with Olmert. Policy was not the\nproblem. There were no major security crises in the months ahead. But in the\nspring of 2008, it became known that the Israeli police were investigating Olmert’s\nrelationship with an American businessman named Moshe Talansky. The\nsuggestion, initially in a New York paper and then the Israeli press, was that\nOlmert was guilty of taking bribes. In his first public response, he didn’t deny\n404\n/ BARAK / 119\nreceiving money from Talansky. But he insisted it was all a part of election\ncampaign contributions.\nPublicly, I reserved judgement. “I hope, for everyone’s sake, and for Prime\nMinister Olmert’s sake, that the suspicions now circulating turn out to be\nbaseless,” I told a reporter. “Let’s be patient.” Privately, I urged him to take a leave\nof absence and clear his name. Yet with other ministers convinced that would\nmake things worse, I held off doing anything else until there seemed to me no\nchoice, after Talansky gave evidence in Jerusalem’s District Court. Though he\ngenuinely seemed not to have expected anything specific in return, he said he had\ngiven Olmert something like $150,000 in cash. I called a news conference the next\nday. I didn’t say whether or not I thought Olmert was guilty. I did say that I\nbelieved he couldn’t continue leading the country while resolving his “personal\nmatters”. Things finally came to ahead in September 2008. When Kadima held\nfresh leadership elections, Tzipi Livni won. Olmert confirmed he would step aside\nfor his successor. But under Israeli law, he would remain Prime Minister until she\neither succeeded in forming a new government or called early elections. She opted\nin the end for Option B, and the election was set for February 2009.\nThat meant Olmert would still be Prime Minister for another three months.\nWe’d long been discussing the increasingly worrying situation in Gaza. After Arik\npulled out, an election had placed Hamas in power, after which the Islamists\nembarked on a violent purge of Fatah loyalists. Arms smuggling through tunnels\nfrom the Sinai had become rife. Rockets from Gaza were now landing on southern\nIsrael. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were living with the reality of a warning\nsiren and a rapid dash into their shelters. For a while, amid negotiations through\nEgypt to end the rocket fire, we limited ourselves to sending small ground units\ninto Gaza to target the source of specific rocket attacks. But that was always going\nto have only a limited effect. It also ran the risk of our soldiers being abducted, or\nkilled.\nPressure was building for a major military operation. With the election drawing\nnearer, Bibi Netanyahu was reminding voters that he’d been against the pullout\nfrom Gaza, and saying that we should now hit Hamas hard. Both Olmert and Tzipi,\nalong with most of the cabinet, were also in favor of doing so. But my long-held\nview, reinforced by the recent war against Hizbollah in Lebanon, was that we had\nto begin by deciding what we wanted to accomplish, and what was possible. Only\nthen could we take action. I told the cabinet that, operationally, we were perfectly\n405\n/ BARAK / 120\ncapable to taking over Gaza. But what then, I asked. Unless we were prepared to\nresume open-ended Israeli control, we’d be left with no one to run Gaza\nafterwards. The obvious candidate, Egypt, was even less interested than we were in\nassuming responsibility for the more than one-and-a-half million Palestinians who\nlived there. I doubted that even Arafat would have been ready to do so. But\nrelations had only worsened, since his death in 2004, between the Fatah old guard\nin the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank and the Hamas overlords in Gaza. I\ndoubted very much that Abu Mazen would want to get involved. I did send an aide\nto see him to ask whether, in principle, he was open to reassuming control of Gaza\nfollowing an Israeli takeover. His answer was unsurprising and unequivocal: no.\nI secured cabinet support for the more limited aim of restoring a period of calm\nfor Israeli citizens in the south. I said the military operation had to be as sharp and\nshort as possible, and end with some kind of political understanding that the\nrockets would stop for a significant period of time. The final plan was presented to\nministers a few days before the operation. It would begin with surprise air strikes\nand a naval bombardment, followed by a limited ground incursion to hit remaining\nHamas targets outside of the major refugee camps, which I was determined to\navoid. The whole operation was intended to last for two weeks at the most.\nHopefully, closer to a week, with diplomatic efforts through Egypt to secure a\nlasting cease-fire and, ideally, prevent Hamas from resupplying its rocket\nstockpiles through its smuggling tunnels from the Sinai.\nWhen we launched Operation Cast Lead on the morning of December 27,\nnearly all the Hamas forces were where we’d expected them to be. Two waves of\nair strikes, with over a hundred jets and attack helicopters, killed 350 Hamas\nfighters. We destroyed Hamas’s headquarters and dozens of its government and\npolice installations. The attacks continued in the days that followed. We took a\nrange of actions designed to minimize civilian casualties. We dropped leaflets\nbefore bombing sorties, phoned residents, and fired light missiles before heavier\nordnance was used. Still, I realized that civilian casualties were unavoidable – if\nonly because Hamas, like Hizbollah in Lebanon, was deliberately firing its rockets\nfrom civilian areas, sometimes even near schools or hospitals. Civilian casualties\nwere obviously tragic in themselves. They also made it inevitable that the longer\nthe operation went on, the more likely we were to face international criticism, and\ndiplomatic pressure to bring it to an end. That was an additional reason I had\ninsisted that the operation be well defined and time-limited.\n406\n/ BARAK / 121\nBut both Olmert and Tzipi soon fell prey to the same self-defeating temptation\nthat had worried me during the meandering war against Hizbollah. Our ground\nincursion began a few days into the operation. The intention was to stay for a few\nmore days and then, responding to inevitable international appeals, call a halt to a\ncampaign that had already achieved nearly all of its targets. Perhaps wanting to\nbalance the failures in Lebanon there with “success” in Gaza, Olmert wanted us to\ncontinue, and expand our attacks deeper into Gaza. I reminded him that we’d\nagreed the aims beforehand. The longer we stayed, the less clear any gains would\nbe. Yes, our ground forces had so far faced virtually no resistance or casualties.\n“But that’s because we’re outside the main populated areas,” I said. “The deeper\nwe get in, the better it will be for Hamas. They gain simply by surviving, like\nHizbollah.” Yet Olmert kept insisting that we’d succeeded so far, so let’s not stop.\nIt wasn’t until January 17, three weeks after the operation began, that we\nannounced a cease-fire. Militarily, the operation was a success. While Hamas\nlaunched nearly 3,000 rockets into Israel in the year before our attack, there were\nonly 300 in the year that followed. But politically and diplomatically, the extra\nweek reduced, rather than helped, the chances of reaching an understanding for a\nlonger-term reduction of the attacks. To the extent there was any political gain, it\nwas to burnish Tzipi Livni’s credentials as a tough potential Prime Minister ahead\nof the election. That was not her intent. Of all the politicians I’ve known, she is\namong the least interested in such games, especially with lives at stake. But it was\none of the effects.\nShe won the election, in a photo finish, with opinion polls suggesting she’d\nbeen effective in shaping the campaign as a choice “between Tzipi and Bibi.”\nKadima got 28 Knesset seats, to 27 for Bibi and the Likud, which gave her the first\ncrack at forming a government. There’s no way of disguising the fact that Labor’s\nresult in my first election back in charge was a disappointment. We went down six\nseats, to 13. The big gainer was a far-right, stridently anti-Arab party called Yisrael\nBeitenu, led by a former Likudnik named Avigdor Lieberman. Tzipi’s attempt to\nform a coalition became less a political process than a contest between rival stalls\nin a Middle Eastern bazaar. Bibi was holding parallel talks with the Orthodox\nparties critical to assembling a parliamentary majority. He was matching and\nraising every assurance of a ministerial seat or budgetary concession that Tzipi was\nprepared to offer. In the end, she threw up her hands, saying she refused to draw\nout a process which was not so much a negotiation as organized extortion. I am\n407\n/ BARAK / 122\nsure she won the respect of many Israelis for taking an all-to-rare stand of\nprinciple. She certainly won mine. But I was not alone in wondering whether it\nwas worth the price that she, Kadima, and the country would pay as a result: Bibi’s\nreturn as Prime Minister in a Likud-led coalition.\nThough I was not surprised when he asked me to remain as Defense Minister,\nand to keep Labor inside the coalition, that was not an easy argument to make to\nmy reduced Knesset contingent. They saw joining Bibi, especially in a government\nwith the right-wing Lieberman as Foreign Minister, as a betrayal of all the efforts\nthat they and I had made to achieve peace with the Palestinians. Still, the decision\non whether to join the coalition ultimately rested with the party central committee,\nalmost every one of whose members was on a local government council. For them,\nthe choice was between a share of power, however limited, and the wilderness of\nopposition. So we joined Bibi’s government.\nI was personally in favor of our doing so, but for more complicated reasons. I\nknew that Bibi’s background, his instincts and his undeniably powerful political\nrhetoric were all firmly rooted on the political right. I recognized that he was often\nmore interested in politics than policy, and perhaps above both of those, in the\ntactical maneuvering required to consolidate his political position. But I had known\nhim long enough to dismiss the suggestions of many of my colleagues that he was\nintellectually shallow. I felt he was capable of doing what was best for Israel, and\nthat he had a basic pragmatism that would guide how he got there. All that,\nhowever, was just a reason for not saying “no” when he asked me and Labor to\nstay on. The reason I felt it was right to say yes had to two with specific policy\nchallenges. The first was to ensure there at least some peace process with the\nPalestinians. But that, in turn, was in large part because I believed it would win us\nthe diplomatic support, especially from the Americans, needed to tackle a more\nurgent threat. It again involved an enemy state trying to get nuclear weapons. But\nnot Syria. The Islamic theocracy of Iran.\nWe’d been aware for a number of years about Iranian efforts to go nuclear. The\nMossad had notched up a series of successes in delaying the Iranians from getting\nthere. But they were getting inexorably closer. In fact, when I’d taken over as\nDefense Minister under Olmert, I formally directed the new chief-of-staff, Gaby\nAshknazi, to get to work on a plan to attack the most important facilities in the\nIranians’ nuclear network, with the aim of pushing back the point at which they\nmight develop a bomb by five to six years. But it became clear we didn’t have the\n408\n/ BARAK / 123\noperational capacity to mount such an attack, in part because we lacked the\nnecessary bunker-busting bombs and the tanker aircraft to get us to Iran and back. I\ndid seek help from the Americans. I met Defense Secretary Bob Gates, CIA\ndirector Mike Hayden, National Security Adviser Steve Hadley and even President\nBush himself. While not explicitly mentioning that we were planning military\naction against Iran, I sounded them out on the prospects of getting more heavy\nmunitions, and possibly leasing several US tanker aircraft.\nYet in our final meeting with President Bush, during a visit to Israel in June\n2008, he made it clear to Olmert and me that he knew what we were up to. Olmert\nhosted a private dinner for the President. Afterwards, Bush asked to talk privately.\nOlmert poured us each a glass of whiskey and lit a cigar, and we sank into brown\nleather armchairs. Smiling, the president looked straight at me, and said to Olmert:\n“This guy scares the living shit out of me when he tells me what you want.”\nHe told Olmert how I’d asked for heavy munitions, tankers and a variety of\nother military equipment. “Remember. I’m a former F-16 pilot,” he said. “I know\nhow to connect the dots.” Then, turning more serious, he added: “I want to tell\nboth of you now, as President, the formal position of the US government. We are\ntotally against any action by you to mount an attack on the nuclear plants.” The\neffect was all the more dramatic because of his Administration’s support for our\nattack on the reactor in Syria the year before. “I repeat,” Bush said, “in order to\navoid any misunderstanding. We expect you not to do it. And we’re not going to\ndo it, either, as long as I am President. I wanted it to be clear.”\nOlmert said nothing, so I replied. “Mr President, we’re in no position to tell you\nwhat the position of the United States should be. But I can tell you what I believe\nhistory will have to say. I’m reminded by what we call, in field artillery,\n‘bracketing and halving.’” I said that in the wake of the Al-Qaeda attack on the\nTwin Towers, he had fired one shell long, in Afghanistan, and another one short, in\nIraq. “But when the time came to hit the real target – Iran – it ended up you’d\nalready spent two terms, and all your political capital.” He seemed neither insulted\nnor unsettled by my remark. He simply nodded. Perhaps, in part, because he was\npretty sure that we lacked the ability to attack the Iranian facilities anyway.\nWe still lacked that capacity when I became Defense Minister in Bibi’s\ngovernment in May 2009. But the main reason I’d stayed in the job, and my main\n409\n/ BARAK / 124\nfocus from the day Bibi’s government took office, was to do all I could to change\nthat.\n410\n/ BARAK / 125\nChapter Twenty-Five\nI had hoped that in facing down the nuclear threat from Iran, I could nudge Bibi\ntowards a reengagement with the Palestinians – not with great enthusiasm, but as\nan act of pure political pragmatism. There were only two ways we could stop the\nIranians from getting a nuclear weapon: for the Americans to make sure that\nhappened, or not to hinder Israel from doing so. Either was going to be a lot harder\nif there was tension with the new American president, Barack Obama, over moves\nto revive the peace process with the Palestinians.\nI didn’t expect it to be put to the test so soon. Yet within weeks of our taking\noffice, President Obama launched an effort to restart negotiations, declaring it\n“intolerable” that there was still not a Palestinian state. He was explicit about what\nIsrael needed to do. In an Oval Office meeting with Bibi in May 2009, and in a\nspeech in Cairo the next month, he called for a total halt to settlement construction\non the West Bank. US opposition to settlements wasn’t new. For years,\nWashington’s position had been that they represented “an obstacle to peace.” The\nmain issue wasn’t even the creation of new settlements, since there had been\nalmost none in recent years. It was the expansion of existing ones. The Jewish\npopulation on the West Bank had been about 190,000 when I became Prime\nMinister. In the decade since then, it had grown to 315,000 – more than half-amillion\nif you counted the Jewish neighborhoods built inside the expanded, post-\n1967 boundaries of Jerusalem. The expansion – “natural growth” as we\neuphemistically described it to the Americans – was what President Obama now\nwanted Bibi to end.\nI had no illusions about how hard it would be to get him to agree. With each\npassing year since Camp David, the pro-settlement right wing in Israel had become\nmore confident and influential. In a way, the settlers and their supporters –\npassionately devoted to a “Greater Israel” and opposed to any Palestinian state –\nhad become the 21 st -century equivalent of the kibbutz avant-garde of a half-century\nearlier. The rise of Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu party was the latest sign,\nalongside a move rightward within the Likud itself. For Bibi to say yes to a\nsettlement freeze would mean putting aside his own short-term political interests in\nrecognition of the importance of our alliance with the Americans. He’d actually\ndone this, twice, during his first term as Prime Minister. He had agreed to give the\n411\n/ BARAK / 126\nPalestinians control of most of Hebron, and accepted further withdrawals under the\nWye River agreement. But amid predictable protests from the right, he had\npromptly retreated from his Wye commitments. I knew that his default response to\nObama’s call for a settlement freeze would be “no.” And it was, delivered first to\nthe cabinet and then to the public, as soon as he got back from his talks with the\nPresident.\nIn my repeated meetings with Bibi in the weeks that followed – both one-onone,\nand within the informal group of close ministers and aides known as the\nGroup of Eight – I tried to persuade him that, if only because of America’s key role\non Iran, we needed to show some sign of engagement with Obama’s efforts. I was\nnot entirely alone. One ally was an old friend: Dan Meridor, who had rejoined the\nLikud before the election. Another was more unexpected: Avigdor Lieberman. He\nwas never going to accept a settlement freeze. Not only did his heart, and political\ninterests, lie on the West Bank. He lived there. But like many in the party he led,\nhe had come to Israel from the former Soviet Union, shaping a worldview that in\nmany ways remained European, and pro-Western. He was worried about creating\nthe impression of blanket Israeli intransigence toward a popular new American\nPresident, and isolating ourselves internationally, if we didn’t go some way\ntowards helping to restart talks with the Palestinians.\nThough Bibi showed no signs of retreat on the settlement freeze, he did accept\nthat broader point. Ten days after Obama’s Cairo speech, he publicly accepted the\nidea of a Palestinian state for the first time, having ruled it out as recently as the\nmonth before in his White House talks with the President. The shift was dismissed\nas trivial not just by the Palestinians, but by many in my own Labor party and\nalmost everyone else on the left. I disagreed. I knew how deep, genuine and\nlongstanding Bibi’s resistance to Palestinian statehood was. But I had another,\nserious concern about the “peace plan” he announced: an entirely new precondition\nhe insisted the Palestinians must meet if peace was ever going to be possible. He\nsaid they must “clearly and unambiguously recognize Israel as the state of the\nJewish people.” On a whole series of levels, that made no sense to me. We hadn’t\nasked Egypt or Jordan to grant us explicit recognition as a Jewish state when we\nmade peace with them. Even when Bibi himself had briefly tried to open\nnegotiations with Damascus in his first period as Prime Minister, we’d never felt\nthe need to ask it of the Syrians either. To the extent there was any logic in\ndemanding it of the Palestinians, Bibi’s reasoning seemed to be that this would\n412\n/ BARAK / 127\nneutralize any recidivist claims to all of Palestine, especially since we had around\n1.5 million Arab citizens living inside our pre-1967 borders. But as I told Bibi, that\nwas a red herring. There was a more straightforward, legally binding answer: a\npeace treaty which, as with Egypt and Jordan, declared an end to our conflict and\nto any further claims on either side.\nMy main concern was more fundamental. Bibi’s new approach contradicted the\ncentral thrust of Zionism: that after centuries of powerlessness and persecution,\nJews would finally take control of their own destiny. We now had our state. It was\nmore than six decades old. “Why do we need the Palestinians, or anyone, to\nvalidate us as a Jewish state? Why propose something that implies the Palestinians\nsomehow have a say in what kind of state we choose to be?” Yet the more I\npressed him, the clearer it became that the substance didn’t much matter to Bibi.\nHis move was political, and tactical, aimed at staking out a position of power in the\ndiplomatic process. Besides, he didn’t expect any new negotiations to make real\nprogress anyway.\nAs Defense Minister, I had scope for taking steps with the Palestinians on my\nown. With Bibi’s knowledge and tacit acceptance, I established a particularly\nstrong relationship with Abu Mazen’s Prime Minister, Salaam Fayyad. A respected\neconomist, he operated on the assumption that neither violence nor negotiations\nseemed likely to lead the Palestinians to statehood as things now stood. He saw his\nrole as doing an end-run. He would put in place the institutions, the infrastructure,\nthe economy, the internal security and the stability needed for an eventual state to\nsucceed. He was trying to do for the Palestinians what Ben-Gurion had done before\n1948. He and I met and talked often but discreetly – sometimes in his office in\nRamallah, sometimes in mine, sometimes over dinner in the 31 st -floor flat I was\nrenting in central Tel Aviv. I remember one dinner in particular. I led him onto the\nterrace after we’d eaten. It was a startlingly clear night. You could see as far north\nas Lebanon and, since the West Bank was barely a dozen miles away, the\ntwinkling lights of Ramallah as well. He gazed in that direction, then at the bright\nlights of the avenues and restaurants and cafés far below us. Smiling, he said:\n“Ehud, why do you need Ramallah when you’ve got Tel Aviv?” I smiled back.\nThere was no need to reply. He knew my views. Not only didn’t Israel need\nRamallah. I was more convinced than ever that it was in our own interest, by treaty\nif possible and unilateral disengagement if not, to remove Israel from all of the\nmajor towns and cities of the West Bank.\n413\n/ BARAK / 128\nI issued a standing directive in the kirya that we should agree to anything\nFayyad asked for, as long as there no security reason to say no. We ended up\narranging a direct source of fuel supply to Jenin, on the northern edge of the West\nBank, and built new terminals to handle it. We facilitated construction permits for\na new industrial zone. For a conference of international economists and business\npeople, we set up VIP treatment at Ben-Gurion Airport, and limousine transport to\nthe conference venue. I believed that if Fayyad succeeded in what he was trying to\naccomplish, it would be a benefit not just for the Palestinians, but for Israel too.\nBibi was agnostic on Fayyad’s efforts. Yet he recognized they did no harm. And in\na way, my support for them was politically convenient. To the extent the\ninternational community, especially the Americans, appreciated our efforts to help\nthe Palestinians, Bibi and others in the government could, and did, claim credit.\nWhen there were complaints from the right, Bibi could and did say: “It wasn’t me.\nIt was Barak.”\nMy part in our relations with the Americans was more politically delicate. As I\ncontinued to prod Bibi toward accepting a settlement freeze during the summer and\nautumn of 2009, my de facto role became to help smooth over the increasingly\nrough edges in our ties with the Obama administration. I knew key figures from\nearlier incarnations in their public lives and mine: Secretary of Defense Bob Gates,\nwho had been President George H. W. Bush’s deputy security adviser in the first\nIraq war and then head of the CIA; and Hillary Clinton, now Secretary of State.\nDuring a series of early trips to the US as Defense Minister, I met Gates, Hillary\nand other senior figures in the administration both formally and informally. In part\nbecause they were aware I favored agreeing to a settlement freeze, they clearly\nfound it a lot easier to talk to me than to Bibi. On one visit, to my regret and Bibi’s\nevident frustration once I’d got home, the press highlighted this dramatic\ndifference in mood. Emerging from talks with me at the State Department, Hillary\ntold reporters that our talks had gone “wonderfully.” She added: “As longtime\nfriends do, much was said. And much didn’t need to be said.” Still, I was careful to\navoid any explicit criticism of Bibi in my meetings in the US. I would point out the\ndomestic political pressures on him in deciding how to proceed. And in any case,\nthe Americans knew that no matter what I might say to them, it was Bibi’s actions\nthat ultimately mattered. He, not I, was Prime Minister.\nI was as surprised as they were when he finally announced a settlement freeze\nin November 2009. As with nearly everything else he did regarding the peace\n414\n/ BARAK / 129\nprocess, it was hedged with several conditions. The freeze would not be openended,\nbut last for 10 months, as a way of boosting the effort to restart\nnegotiations. It would apply to new construction, not work already underway. And\nit would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of\nJerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the\nPalestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost\nnowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not\nextending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t\nbuy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained\nsteadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further\nwidening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama\nadministration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement\nfreeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all\nthe difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was\nrenewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for\nAbu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama\nhad placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also\nsuited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in\nIsrael’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became\nmore evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking\nover, and avoid any major new crisis.\nHe appointed an old personal friend – a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak\nMolcho – as our negotiator. I finally realized how pointless the exercise was when,\nduring a visit to the United States, I found myself in New York at the same time as\nMolcho. We met at the Israeli consulate. We spoke in detail about the state of the\nnegotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the\nsecure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear\nthere were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political\nrisk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating\nprogress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of\ndeals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the\nclient. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can – not a peace treaty, just\na deal on a specific issue – he’ll do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can\ngo on negotiating forever. And it’s pretty clear me that’s his brief.” Bibi insisted I\nwas wrong. He said that what I saw as time-wasting was simple prudence, to make\nsure the negotiations bore fruit. But his approach never changed. Whenever it came\n415\n/ BARAK / 130\nup in our inner Group of Eight discussions, I could usually count only on Dan\nMeridor, and occasionally a handful of others, to argue in favor of any form of\ninitiative on our side. In private meetings, Bibi did sometimes engage in discussion\nabout what Israel might do. But he invariably steered the conversation elsewhere,\ninsisting that the real issue was the Palestinians’ lack of any interest in making\npeace.\nMy main worry wasn’t the immediate future of the negotiations. For now, the\nchances of an agreement seemed close to zero. It was the longer-term damage\nBibi’s approach would do in further delaying any serious move by Israel to put our\nrelations with the Palestinians on a more stable and sustainable footing. The\ndithering, delay and deadlock suited him politically. Ironically, my own efforts on\nthe security front had also made it easier for us to do next to nothing. Intermittent\noutbreaks of violence always remained a threat. Yet the West Bank security fence,\nalong with our military, police and intelligence measures, meant it was very\nunlikely we’d see a return to the full-blown terror war of the second intifada. I was\nalso working to secure US support for our development of increasingly effective\nanti-missile weapons to reduce the threat from Hamas in Gaza. The overall result\nwas that for many, if not most, Israelis, the conflict with the Palestinians didn’t\nimpact on their day-to-day lives. It was unseen and largely unfelt.\nStill, the effect of the stalemate on our relationship with Washington did matter:\nboth for our security cooperation on things like the anti-missile weapons and,\ncrucially, the challenge which had led me into Bibi’s government in the first place:\nkeeping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n* * *\nIt was a race against time. The Iranians were producing more and more\nyellowcake, building more advanced centrifuges, accumulating more low-enriched\nuranium. They were getting better at hiding and protecting the network of facilities\nbeing used to try to produce a nuclear weapon. And in the early months of Bibi’s\nPrime Ministership, the question we faced wasn’t even whether to take military\naction against Iran – something I knew, from Bob Gates and others, that the\nObama administration viewed no more favourably than George W. Bush. It was\n416\n/ BARAK / 131\nwhether that would even be possible to strike before the Iranians entered their\n“zone of immunity” – the point at which the amount of damage we could do to\ntheir nuclear program would be too negligible to be worth the operational, political\nand diplomatic risks from such an attack. In the early months, my priority was to\nensure we at least had a military option. A full year before joining Bibi’s\ngovernment, as Defense Minister under Olmert, I’d first tried to put an operational\nplan in place, only to find that the lack of heavy munitions and refuelling aircraft\nmade it impossible. That was especially frustrating because at that point, our\nexperts calculated that a successful strike could have set back the Iranian nuclear\neffort by about six years. Given the Iranians’ knowledge we could attack again,\nand their need to restart clandestine efforts to secure key components abroad, that\nmeant a very real prospect of ending the nuclear program altogether. On joining\nBibi’s government, I began working, both with the kirya and the engineers and\ntechnological experts in our military industries, to make sure we had the weaponry\nand equipment, and an operational plan for a surgical strike. It was not until mid-\n2010, a year into Bibi’s government, that I was confident we’d reached that point,\nin part thanks to Israeli-produced heavy bombs and tanker aircraft. Our experts\nestimated we would still be able to set back the Iranian nuclear efforts by up to\nfour years, almost certainly enough to end them indefinitely.\nYet making military action possible proved to be the easy part. The question\nnow became whether we should be prepared to launch a strike against Iran’s\nnuclear facilities. Answering it was like a contest of three-dimensional chess,\ninvolving both an internal debate among Israel’s political and military leadership\nand discussions with an Obama administration whose priority remained to\nnegotiate an end to Iran’s nuclear program. On major security decisions in Israel,\ntwo ministers always mattered the most: the Prime Minister and Defense Minister.\nNeither Bibi nor I doubted we had to ready to strike if that proved necessary. Nor\ndid Foreign Minister Lieberman. Even for us, it was an option to be considered\nonly when all other ways to rein in the Iranians were failing. We also agreed on\ntwo other preconditions. We would have to secure international legitimacy, most of\nall from the Americans, for what would be a clear act of self-defense. And we’d\nneed to demonstrate an imperative urgency to act, with the approach of the “zone\nof immunity” that would take any military option off the table for good.\nIdeally, we hoped the US-led campaign of economic and diplomatic pressure\nwould get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, as Libya had done in the wake of\n417\n/ BARAK / 132\nits terror attack on a Pan American airliner in the late 1980s. Or, as in South\nAfrica, that a change in nuclear policy might come from a change in régime in\nTehran. Yet realistically, we couldn’t count on either. And there was no doubt in\nour minds that a nuclear Iran represented a hugely serious threat. If the Shi’ite\nMuslim regime in Iran did get a nuclear weapon, Sunni Arab states like Egypt and\nSaudi Arabia, and Turkey as well, would try to go nuclear. Neither they nor we\ncould assume that Iran was developing a bomb as a mere act of deterrence. We\ncouldn’t exclude the possibility that, especially in a crisis threatening the survival\nof the ayatollahs’ rule, Iran would use the weapons it was developing. It could\neven send a nuclear device in a container smuggled on board a commercial vessel\ndocking in one of Israel’s ports.\nWhile few in Israel disputed the seriousness of the threat, a number of top\npolitical and military figures had deep misgivings about military action. Given the\nneed for secrecy, most of our discussions took place within the so-called Group of\nEight, often also including the chief of staff and other top generals from the kirya.\nBoth Dan Meridor and Benny Begin, Menachem Begin’s son and a minister\nwithout portfolio, were opposed to an Israeli attack from the start. They were\nconvinced that the implications for the region, and for our relations with the wider\nworld, were difficult to predict and potentially dire. Dan raised a further concern.\nHe feared an Israeli attack might actually intensify Iran’s effort to get a nuclear\nbomb, only now with political cover, because it would argue it was acting in selfdefense.\nThe view of those opposed to an Israeli strike was that we should rely on\nAmerican economic and political pressure to deal with the threat. And, if that\nfailed, on American military action.\nIn November 2010, the internal debate came to a head, at a meeting involving\nthe Group of Eight as well as the chief of staff, the head of military intelligence\nand the commander of the air force. We convened in a villa that the Mossad kept\nfor clandestine foreign visitors, near the coastal road north of Tel Aviv. The\nmeeting began with a presentation by the generals of our attack plan. There was\nstill a core of ministers opposed: chiefly Dan Meridor and Benny Begin, but also\nBoogie Ya’alon, a former Sayeret Matkal commander and chief of staff who\nMinister of Strategic Affairs. But the confidence and detail with which the plan\nwas laid out, and the fact that Bibi, Lieberman and I were in favor of being\nprepared to act, gave me the sense that a majority would back military action if it\nbecame necessary. The proviso would be the need for the chief-of-staff, and ideally\n418\n/ BARAK / 133\nthe heads of military intelligence and Mossad, to sign off on the operational\nviability of the plan.\nThat was what now ended any prospect of military action, at least for a few\nmonths. Bibi, Lieberman and I withdrew into a side room to talk with the chief of\nstaff, Gaby Ashkenazi, as well as the heads of military intelligence, the Mossad\nand and Shin Bet. We emphasized that no final decision on whether to attack had\nbeen taken. That would require a further meeting with the Group of Eight, and then\nthe full cabinet. But we asked each of them for their views on the operation. We\nknew they had political reservations, along the lines of those voiced by Dan\nMeridor. On an issue of this magnitude, it was accepted practice that military and\nintelligence commanders could weigh in on the political implications as well. But\ntheir formal role was operational and professional. Ashkenazi and the other\ngenerals did concede that in every area – planning, materiel, training and\nintelligence – our attack plan was far ahead of where it had been a year earlier. Yet\nAshkenazi, in particular, concluded that the preparations had not yet “crossed the\nthreshold of operational capability”.\nI was furious. I respected the considered opposition of ministers like Dan or\nBenny Begin. I had no problem with the chief-of-staff or other generals expressing\nsimilar views on the political or geo-strategic implications of an Israeli attack, even\nthough our intelligence assessments suggested the concerns were almost certainly\nunfounded. Yet what I found astonishing was Ashkenazi’s suggestion that the\n“operational threshold” had not been crossed. Yes, this would be a demanding\nmission. It was not without risks. No operation was. But having followed every\nstage and detail of the preparations – and as a former chief of staff and intelligence\nchief myself – I believed it was simply wrong on a professional level to say that\nwe lacked the capacity, and a workable plan, for a military strike if the order was\ngiven.\nAshkenazi’s objection did mean there was no way we were going to attack at\nleast until well into the new year. Our discussions would continue, as would our\nrefinement and strengthening of the attack plan. So would Iran’s progress toward\nits “zone of immunity,” which we now believed would begin late in 2012, a couple\nof years away. As that point drew closer, we’d face an ever-more-pressing need to\ndecide finally whether military action was necessary.\n419\n/ BARAK / 134\nYet the delay in getting to that point had serious implications for my role as\nLabor Party leader. Since the negotiations with the Palestinians were stuck in\nneutral, I was under increasing pressure from within Labor to pull out of Bibi’s\ngovernment. What on earth was the point of staying, they asked. All I was doing,\nfrom their perspective, was giving Bibi political cover for abandoning any serious\neffort to get a peace agreement. Their argument was entirely reasonable. My\nfrustration was that, due to the need for military secrecy, the counter-argument was\nimpossible for me to make: that I felt I had a responsibility to stay at a time when\nthere remained a real possibility Israel might need to take military action against\nIran. To a mix of consternation and anger among many Labor colleagues, I ended\nup taking what seemed to me the only realistic option. In January 2011, I left the\nLabor Party. With three other of our ministers in the government – who were, of\ncourse, aware of the ongoing Iran discussions – I set up a new “centrist, Zionist”\nparty called Ha’Atzmaut, or Independence. We remained in Bibi’s government.\n* * *\nMy main focus was now on the Americans. In order to secure the “international\nlegitimacy” any Israeli attack required, we had to win at least their understanding\nthat we might feel it necessary to act. Fortunately, I had built up a good\nrelationship with the key figures in the Obama administration. That had not always\nbeen easy, given the tension between the Americans and Bibi. That wasn’t just\nbecause of the deadlock in the peace process, still a priority for President Obama.\nThere were other complications. Ever since the initial pressure for a settlement\nfreeze, right-wing politicians and commentators, and Bibi himself, had taken to\nportraying President Obama as fundamentally unsympathetic to Israel. After the\nRepublicans’ victory in the mid-term Congressional elections in November 2010,\nBibi went a step further. He began cozying up to congressmen and senators on the\nother side of the aisle. This overt meddling in the internal politics of our closest\nally was not just a breach of longstanding tradition, but of common sense.\nMembers of the Administration began privately calling Bibi “the Republican\nsenator from Rechavia” – a reference to the Jerusalem neighborhood where the\nPrime Minister’s residence was located.\n420\n/ BARAK / 135\nYet especially with my main points of contact in the administration – first Bob\nGates and then his successor, Leon Panetta, as Secretary of Defense –our broadly\nshared views, mutual respect, and the strength of the US-Israeli alliance\noutweighed any of that. Neither they, nor indeed President Obama, wavered from\ntheir commitment to the principle that Israel needed to retain our “qualitative\nmilitary advantage” over any combination of threats we might face, nor to the $3\nbillion package of annual US aid that underpinned it. We were even able to agree\non additional US backing for our increasingly effective range of anti-missile\nsystems: the Arrow, against long-range ballistic missiles, developed in\ncoordination with the US defense contractor Raytheon; “David’s Sling,” to target\nenemy forces’ mid-range missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft; and our new Iron\nDome system, integrating sophisticated Israeli radar and guidance technology and\ndesigned to deal with the missile threat from Hizbollah on our northern border and\nHamas in Gaza. It had not yet been used in battle. But from test firings, we were\nconfident it could destroy incoming rockets with nearly 90-per-cent success.\nBy late 2011, the issue of Iran had taken on much greater urgency. There was\nstill no sign the American-led diplomatic efforts were succeeding in removing the\nnuclear threat. As for an American military strike, though the President\nintermittently declared that “all options” remained on the table, I knew from senior\nadministration members that it was extremely unlikely to happen. Iran, meanwhile,\nhad been acquiring thousands more centrifuges, more uranium, and heavier\nprotection around its key sites. And the “window of vulnerability” was now only\nabout a year away.\nOperationally and politically, at least now a majority of the key players in Israel\nagreed that we had to be prepared to take military action if there was no alternative\nway to rein in the Iranians. Ashkenazi’s successor as chief-of-staff, Benny Gantz,\nhad signed off on the attack plan. While the Iranians were getting ever closer to\nnuclear-weapons capability, the strike force that we were assembling was also\nbetter equipped, trained and prepared to mount a complex, yet almost certainly\nsuccessful, operation. The damage to Iran’s nuclear ambitions would be\nconsiderably less than if we had acted earlier. But our intelligence analysts still\nestimated we could set back the Iranians’ program by about two years.\nThe immediate problem turned out to be timing. A major joint military exercise\nwith the Americans, agreed on two years earlier, was due to take place in Israel in\nApril 2012. It would include Patriot missile batteries, naval vessels, and thousands\n421\n/ BARAK / 136\nof uniformed US personnel. The focus was, of all things, on defense against a\nmissile attack from Iran. I contacted Leon Panetta to see whether we could delay it.\nThe official reason cited by the Americans, when they agreed to do it, did have the\nmerit of being true: that Bibi was coming under pressure to shift our budgetary\npriorities away from defense toward social and economic issues. But Panetta\nunderstood that my request for a delay meant we were at least considering military\naction. He also realized that if we did launch an attack, it was in the Americans’\nown interest for their troops be as far away from Israel as possible. We agreed to\nreschedule the exercise for October 2012. That meant that if we did decide to\nattack, we’d have until well into September, when significant numbers of US\ntroops would begin arriving.\nAs we weighed our final decision, I held a series of high-level meetings in\nWashington: with Panetta, national security adviser Tom Donilon, Hillary Clinton,\nand President Obama himself. Though not explicitly saying we were ready to\nattack, I left no doubt that we were seriously considering it, and explained the\nreasons we believed our country’s fundamental security interests might make it\nnecessary. The message from all of the Americans I met was that the\nadministration shared our basic goal: to prevent, or at least seriously impair, Iran’s\ndrive to get a nuclear bomb. But they continued to believe that non-military\npressure was the best way to do it.\nThe Americans knew we were skeptical that the non-military route would work,\nand that we were deeply worried about the implications of not taking military\naction if it failed. I discussed our thinking – and, in general terms, our plans – in\nmy meetings with Panetta. He already had a pretty good idea of the broad contours\nof what we were contemplating, since US radar systems and electronic intercepts\nhad been recording the volume and nature of air force exercises we’d been\nconducting over recent months. Leon and I had by now got to know each other\nwell, having first met when he was in charge of the CIA at the start of the Obama\nadministration. In one of our early meetings at CIA headquarters in Langley, there\nhad been a small bunch of grapes on his desk and I plucked a few in my mouth\nwith obvious enjoyment. Now, at the Pentagon, he had a big bowlful ready\nwhenever we met. The fact that he opposed an Israeli military operation made him\nno less of a pleasure to deal with. He was unfailingly calm and even tempered. He\nhad an encyclopedic grasp of issues of defense, intelligence, budgets and policy.\nHe was always rock-solid in America’s commitments to Israel. It’s worth\n422\n/ BARAK / 137\nremembering that, in spite of Israel’s insistence from 1948 onward that we would\nnever ask others to do our fighting for us, even as Leon and I were meeting, US\nradar operators were working around the clock to provide us with early warning\nagainst any incoming Iranian missiles. Patriot batteries were ready to deploy in\nIsrael within 72 hours of any attack. AEGIS naval vessels were within 96 hours of\nour shores, to reinforce Israel’s Arrow missile defense system with sea-launched\nweapons.\nPanetta made no secret of the fact he didn’t want us to launch a military strike,\neffectively killing off the many months of intensive work the Americans had\ndevoted to building international political and economic pressure on the Iranians.\nHe urged me to “think twice, three times,” before going down that road. But he\nrecognized that Israel would be affected far more dramatically by a nuclear Iran.\n“It’s your conflict. It’s your neighborhood,” he said. At one point, he asked me\noutright: “If you do decide to attack the Iranian facilities, when will we know?” I\ntold him we couldn’t give him more than a few hours’ notice. Otherwise, the\nAmericans would have to alert their bases in the Gulf, and worldwide. That might\nwell put Iran on guard before our operation was launched. But I did recognize our\nresponsibility not to leave the Americans in the dark, not only because they were a\nkey ally but because their own military and naval personnel might be at risk from\nany Iranian retaliation. “We know your command-post deployment and the\ncommunications protocols with your forces,” I told him. “We’ll make sure you\nhave enough time to tell your people,” I said. “We won’t endanger a single\nAmerican life, any of your positions or your personnel.”\nMy most important meeting was with the President. Though I knew him less\nwell than I did Panetta, we had met on a number of occasions. The first time was\nwhen he was still Senator Obama, on a visit to Israel during the 2008 presidential\ncampaign. As Defense Minister, I escorted him to Sderot, the town in southern\nIsrael bearing the brunt of Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza. Back in Jerusalem, we\nspent a half-hour talking in my office: about Iran. I argued that a nuclear Iran was a\nchallenge not only for Israel and the Middle East, but for America, too. I urged\nhim, if elected, to commission an early study of what the Iranians were seeking to\ndo and what could be done to stop them either by diplomatic means or, if\nnecessary, by force. Also, what the Iranians could, or more relevantly could not, do\nin response to an American or indeed an Israel attack, since our intelligence\nassessments suggested their options for retaliation would be fairly limited. Obama\n423\n/ BARAK / 138\nstruck me from that first meeting as strong, cool-headed, highly intelligent and\nintensely cerebral. Though we didn’t go into the details of the Iranian nuclear\nthreat, he did talk at some length about the implications for the region, and about\nbroader Middle Eastern security challenges. He displayed a grasp of the cultural\nand political nuances of an increasingly diverse and complex world that was more\nimpressive than many of the other American political or military leaders whom I’d\nmet.\nWhen he and I now returned to the issue of Iran, in the White House, he had an\nundeniable command of the details of Iran’s nuclear program, and of the American\nmilitary options, should he choose to use them. He opened by summarizing the US\nposition. He emphasized that his and our objective was the same: the keep Iran\nfrom developing a nuclear weapon. We were already cooperating to achieve that,\nfor instance through cyber-attacks to slow down the nuclear program. The\ndifference, he said, was that Israeli leaders seemed to feel an urgent need to reach a\ndecision on military action. In Obama’s view, such a move would be both\npremature and potentially harmful to the coalition he’d helped assemble to exert\ndiplomatic and economic pressure on Iran.\nMaybe you had to be an Israeli truly to understand our urgency about Iran. In\nthe early years of the state, the explanation we gave for our preoccupation with\nsecurity – our near-obsession, as some non-Israelis saw it – was that we were\nsurrounded by Arab countries pledged not just to defeat us, but erase us from the\nmap. Egypt or Syria, Jordan or Iraq, could afford to lose an Arab-Israeli war.\nIsrael’s first defeat, however, would be its last. That picture had changed\ndramatically over the decades. We no longer had to worry about the prospect of\nlosing a war. The “qualitative edge” we possessed over all enemy armies in the\nregion ensured that. As Israel’s chief of staff, Prime Minister, and now Defense\nMinister, I had made it a major priority to safeguard that advantage, not just\nthrough our alliance with the US but with the remarkable domestic resources we\npossessed in military engineering, manufacturing, design, invention and high-tech.\nBut the new-order challenge represented by Iran was not just theoretical or\nacademic. Though we had a policy of not commenting on on our own nuclear\nstatus, it was widely assumed in the Arab world and internationally that Israel had,\nat the very least, the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons. But whatever\nnuclear capability we might possess was for deterrence. Even when threatened\nwith conventional defeat, however briefly, in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, it is\n424\n/ BARAK / 139\nworth noting that the conflict remained conventional. Iran was different. Only the\nmost naïve observer would exclude the possibility that if the Iranians did get a\nnuclear weapon, they might use it. And even if they didn’t, the entire strategic\npicture would change, with the need to find a response not just to a nuclear Iran,\nbut potentially a nuclear Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\nI was not about to lecture President Obama on this. While Bibi liked to portray\nhim variously as weak, naïve or tone-deaf to interests and security of Israel, I knew\nfrom our previous meetings that he was none of these things. Yet I did, in a\ndeliberately non-didactic way, raise the issue of our different perspectives on the\nIranians’ getting nuclear arms. “You see it in the context of the whole world,” I\ntold the President. “If Iran, in spite of all our efforts, gets a nuclear weapon, yes, it\nwill be bad. But for you, it’s just one more nuclear state. It won’t dramatically\nchange the situation for America. For us, it can turn into a real, existential threat.”\nHe agreed that we inevitably looked at the situation differently. But after\npausing a few seconds, he said: “Ehud, think of it this way. You get to school in\nthe morning and there’s this big, nasty bully. You can take him on, maybe give\nhim a black eye. But you have this bigger, stronger friend, who can knock him out\ncold. The only problem is that your friend won’t be there until the afternoon.”\nI would have liked nothing more than to wait for our “bigger, stronger” friend,\nespecially since I knew through my contacts in the American military and\nintelligence establishment how much bigger and stronger an American attack\nwould be. During the first couple of years that Israel was working on acquiring the\ncapability for a military strike, the Americans had been no more ready than we\nwere. They did have the tanker aircraft and the heavy bombs. But their plan – a\nkind of Iraq-style shock and awe – was so obviously prone to lead to a wider\nconflict that it would never have received the go-ahead from President Obama, or\nprobably any president. I used to joke with colleagues in the Pentagon that while\nIsrael’s idea of a “surgical operation” was the equivalent of a scalpel, they seemed\nto favor a chisel and a ten-pound hammer. By the time I met the President in 2012,\nthat had changed. Under Gates and then Panetta, an intensive research-anddevelopment\neffort and enormously improved planning and training had yielded\nresults. The Americans now had high-precision heavy munitions we couldn’t\ndream of, and stealth air-attack capabilities we also lacked. They had an\noperational plan which, within a period of hours, could push the Iranian nuclear\n425\n/ BARAK / 140\nprogram back by years. And even if the Iranians knew it was coming, they’d be\nable to do nothing to stop it.\n“Our problem, Mr, President,” I said, “is that we can’t be sure our friend will\nshow up. Since Iran is already very nearly in a zone of immunity against an Israeli\nattack, we can’t afford to wait until the afternoon. By then, with our capabilities,\nwe won’t even be able to give the bully a black eye.” I said I trusted what he’d just\ntold me. “I’m sure it genuinely reflects your intentions now. But there are no\nfutures contracts in statesmanship. There’s no way that you, or any leader, can\ncommit yourself to what will happen in a year or two. When the moment of\ndecision arrives, nothing will be able to free you from the responsibility to look at\nthe situation as it is then, with American interests in mind.”\nHe accepted the point. But he reiterated his view that “kinetic action” – US\nsecurity-speak for a military strike – would not only remove his ability to exhaust\nthe non-military alternatives. He said it wouldn’t be in Israel’s interests, either.\n“We hear that even people high up in your military, in military intelligence and the\nMossad, are against it.”\nThat, I couldn’t deny. “We highly respect our top people in the military, and in\nintelligence. We make a point of listening to them before taking action,” I said.\n“But here’s the difference. When they look up, they see Netanyahu, or me. When\nBibi and I look up, we see heaven. Whoever is up there, we clearly can’t go to\nthem for advice. We are responsible for Israel’s security.”\nThe president smiled, but brought the discussion back down to earth. When he\nagain urged us to consider the American position in any decision, I replied: “Mr\nPresident, I feel compelled to tell you frankly how I see the situation. We highly\nappreciate, and are grateful, that America supports Israel in so many ways. I\nbelieve we’re doing our best to support American interests in the Middle East as\nwell. But when it comes to issues critical for the security and future of Israel, and\nin a way for the future of the Jewish people, we can’t afford to delegate\nresponsibility even to our best friend and ally. When we face such situations, we\nhave to decide on our own, and act on our decisions. I would expect the United\nStates, and you as its president, to respect that position.” He did not seem\nespecially happy with what I’d said. But he showed no anger. Though we differed,\nit was clear that he understood and respected our position. In any case, I believed it\n426\n/ BARAK / 141\nwas important to convey to him honestly, face-to-face, where Israel stood on Iran.\nOr at least where I stood.\n* * *\nWith our joint exercises pushed back until the fall, the logical time for us to\nattack was the summer of 2012, when the atmospheric and weather conditions\nwere optimal. Operationally, everything was ready. Politically, those ministers who\nwere against military action had not changed their minds. If anything, they seemed\nmore strongly opposed. Ironically, they now argued that because we’d waited so\nlong, the Iranians were too close to their “window of immunity.” Even some senior\nmembers of the military and security establishment, though in agreement over the\ntechnical aspects of the attack plan, retained political reservations. But as I’d told\nPresident Obama, now that we had the operational support of the military and\nintelligence professionals, the decision in effect rested with Bibi and me. The fact\nwe were ready to go ahead in those circumstances was not unprecedented. When\nMenachem Begin ordered the bombing of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor in\n1981, he had acted against the advice of the then-heads of both the Mossad and\nmilitary intelligence, the chairman of our nuclear energy commission, and of\nShimon Peres, who was head of the Labor opposition.\nBut as we neared our final, formal decision, we were forced into another delay.\nIn the summer of 2012, an unrelated flare-up of tensions in the Gulf caused Iran\nand several of its neighbors to place their forces on heightened alert. Though the\npeak-alert phase passed quickly, Iran’s military was still not back on a fully normal\nfooting by the start of September, and when small American advance teams began\narriving for the joint exercises, Iran’s alert level went up again. Technically, we\ncould still have gone ahead with the attack. In all probability, it would still have\nsucceeded, setting back the Iranians’ program by at least a year and, depending on\nhow quickly they could rebuild and resupply clandestinely abroad, perhaps for\nsignificantly longer.\nBut as more and more American soldiers and sailors arrived, I finally decided\nagainst an Israeli strike – not because I doubted the damage it would do to Iran’s\nnuclear efforts, but because of the damage it would surely do to our ties with the\n427\n/ BARAK / 142\nUS. No matter how we might explain our attack, with the joint exercises soon to\nbegin, it would come over as a deliberate attempt to implicate our most important\nally in a potential conflict with Iran, against the explicit wishes of President\nObama. I felt this even more strongly when, a few weeks later, I was contacted by\none of Bibi’s close political allies. He sounded me out on the possibility of\nlaunching our strike against Iran after the joint exercise: barely two weeks before\nthe 2012 US election. Politically, he argued, Obama would then feel compelled to\nsupport Israel’s action, or at the very least to refrain from criticizing it. In other\nwords, we would be setting a political trap for the President of the United States. I\ncouldn’t quite believe he was suggesting it. But my reply to this last-gasp\nsuggestion of a way for us to attack the Iranian sites required no hesitation, and\nonly two words: “No way.”\nBibi would have known I would oppose such a ploy. But as with so much else\nin the years I spent in his government, I think it was the politics of the scheme,\nmore than the substance, that enticed him. Almost everything he did seemed\nincreasingly about creating a kind of grand narrative to secure his position on the\nright, solidifying a base which he figured would sustain him in office. At its core,\nthe narrative presented a picture of vulnerability and victimhood: a kind of\n“fortress Israel” threatened by terror, missiles on its northern and southern borders,\nand now potential nuclear annihilation from Iran, while our main ally, the United\nStates, was under the sway of a President who neither understood nor\nfundamentally supported us. In day-to-day policy terms, this allowed Bibi to insist\nwe couldn’t risk serious engagement with the Palestinians. On domestic issues as\nwell, like the widening gap between those at the top of our high-tech economy and\na painfully squeezed middle class, the sense of crisis he encouraged gave him\nlicense to hunker down, warn of impending doom, and do virtually nothing.\nEffective though the narrative was for him politically, it bore no resemblance to\nreality. Yes, President Obama disagreed with us on issues of policy, both the peace\nprocess and on how to deal with Iran. But he was unquestionably committed to\nAmerica’s alliance with Israel. I had dealt face-to-face with four US presidents:\nboth of the Bushes, President Clinton and now President Obama. In terms of Israeli\nsecurity, none had proved as consistently supportive and helpful as Obama. And\nyes, Israel did face an array of security challenges. A nuclear-armed Iran would\nundeniably make things worse. But far from being under existential threat, we\n428\n/ BARAK / 143\nwere a regional superpower, with a military as effective as any in the world, and a\nhigh-tech economic sector justifiably compared to Silicon Valley.\nEvery few weeks, Bibi, Lieberman and I would meet for a wide-ranging\ndiscussion on the patio of the Prime Minister’s residence. Shortly after we’d\nabandoned the idea of a military strike, I raised head-on my objections to the\nskewed image Bibi was promoting of our country. It wasn’t just inaccurate, I said.\nEspecially when his rhetoric was in full flight, and he compared the prospect of a\nnuclear Iran to a new “Holocaust,” it struck me as a betrayal of the core tenet of\nZionism: an state in which Jews were in control of their own destiny. “We are in\nthat position now,” I said. It was nonsensical to argue we were so threatened by\neverything around us, for instance, that we couldn’t “risk” taking the initiative\nrequired to disentangle ourselves from the Palestinians on the West Bank. “I don’t\nget you,” I said, turning to Lieberman as well. “Your rhetoric suggests you have\nspines of steel. But your behavior is living proof of the old saying that it’s easier to\ntake Jews out of the galut, than take the galut out of the Jews.” Galut is Hebrew for\nthe diaspora. “The whole Zionist project was based on the idea of taking our fate\ninto our own hands, and actively trying to change the reality around us. But you\nbehave as if we never left the galut. You’re mired in a mindset of pessimism,\npassivity and anxiety, which in terms of policy or action, leads to paralysis. Of\ncourse, there are risks in any action, or any policy initiative. But in the situation\nwhere Israel finds itself, the biggest risk of all is being unable or unwilling to take\nrisks, as if we somehow on the brink of destruction.”\nI was especially upset by Bibi’s increasingly use of Holocaust imagery. “Just\nthink of what you’re saying,” I told him. “You’re Prime Minister of the State of\nIsrael, not a rabbi in a shtetl, or a speaker trying to raise funds for Israel abroad.\nThink of the implications. We’re not in Europe in 1937. Or 1947. If it is a\n‘Holocaust,’ what’s our response: to fold up and go back to the diaspora? If Iran\ngets a bomb, it’ll be bad. Very bad. But we’ll still be here. And we’ll find a way of\ndealing with the new reality.”\nYet “fortress Israel” was irresistibly comfortable for Bibi politically. I now had\nto accept that, while he and I had known each other for more than half-a-century,\nnothing I could do or say was going to change that. With the next Israeli election\nmonths away, in January 2013, I confided to Nili, and then to my closest aides, that\nI was not going to run for a seat in the Knesset. Israeli military action against Iran\n429\n/ BARAK / 144\nwas off the agenda. The diplomatic process with the Palestinians was stalemated. I\ncould see no point in remaining in the government.\nLike my last period in Olmert’s government, my final few months were\ndominated by finding a way to end Hamas attacks from Gaza. During one 24-hour\nperiod in November, Hamas launched more than 100 rockets at towns in the south,\nwhile also attacking two military units across the border. Especially since our\nmilitary response would be the last during my time as Defense Minister, I was\ndetermined that, this time, it would have a strictly defined objective and a finite\ntime frame. The overall objective hadn’t changed since Olmert’s premiership: to\nhit Hamas hard, bring down the number of rocket attacks to as near zero as\npossible, and reach an agreement, through the Egyptians, which established a\nperiod of calm on our border for as long as we could. Bibi’s “victimhood”\nnarrative notwithstanding, one aspect of the military balance in the south was now\ndramatically different. With my backing as Defense Minister, we now had Iron\nDome, which I was confident would help deal with the inevitable shower of Hamas\nrockets that would follow our initial attack. Again, I felt it was essential to start\nwith a quick, unexpected, damaging first strike. Then, through sustained air\nbombardment, to keep up enough pressure to secure the political arrangement we\nwanted. And, unlike under Olmert, to end the operation as soon as we’d achieved\nits aim.\nOn the afternoon of November 14, we launched a targeted air strike on Hamas’s\nde facto chief of staff, Ahmed Jabari. We’d gone after Jabari in the past but, for\none reason or another, had failed. We also hit nearly two dozen other Hamas\ntargets, including all of the main missile sites we had identified. The whole\noperation lasted a week. Hamas fired nearly 1,500 rockets into Israel, not just\nlocally manufactured Qassems but longer-range Iranian Fajr-5s and Russian Grads.\nFor the first time since the 1991 Gulf war, several were targeted at Tel Aviv and\nJerusalem. Fortunately, they were not significantly more accurate than in the past.\nMore than half landed in fields or orchards. And with Iron Dome deployed around\nour major towns and cities, more than 80 per cent were intercepted.\nWe hit nearly 1,500 targets over the seven-day period, mostly launch-pads,\nHamas government installations and weapons stores, but also a number of\napartment complexes being used by Hamas as bases or firing points. Bibi rightly\npointed out that we were forced to fight a fundamentally asymmetric battle. While\nIsrael began with the principle of directing our fire away from civilian areas,\n430\n/ BARAK / 145\nHamas based its launchers in precisely those places. So it was not easy. At one\npoint, we announced a call-up of reserves. We hinted at a possible ground\nincursion. But both Bibi and I knew we were going to avoid that if at all possible,\nand we did. Though there were inevitable civilian casualties, most of the\nPalestinians killed were Hamas fighters and leaders, including not just Jabari but\nthe head of Hamas’s rocket program. By limiting ourselves to air strikes and naval\nfire, the Palestinian death toll was around 150, about one-tenth of what it had been\nin 2008. Six Israelis, including four civilians, lost their lives. On the 21 st of\nNovember, the cease-fire was announced.\nYet with the election approaching, and my time in public life drawing to a\nclose, I had no illusion that this latest military operation, or future ones, would\nbring us closer to the negotiating peace with the Palestinians that had eluded us\nsince Oslo. Nor was I confident that, having been unable to mount a military strike\nof our own on Iran, Obama’s “bigger, stronger kid” in the schoolyard would take\nmilitary action. I did trust him to do all he could to use diplomacy to constrain\nIran’s efforts to get a bomb. I feared he might fail. Even if he succeeded, I figured\nthe best case would be an agreement that, at least on paper, delayed the Iranians’\ndevelopment of a weapon. My hope remained that Israel’s relationship with the\nAmericans would be sufficiently strong for us to reach a formal understanding of\nwhat form of surgical military strike each of our countries might take if Iran didn’t\nhonor the terms of a negotiated deal.\nWhen I first left political life after my election defeat in 2001, I’d described my\nstatus as the equivalent of a reserve officer. I said, and believed, it was unlikely I’d\nreturn for the foreseeable future. But I knew it wasn’t impossible. This time was\ndifferent. When I announced publicly that I was leaving politics, five days after the\nGaza cease-fire, I pointed that I had spent the greater part of my life as a soldier.\nI’d never had a burning desire to be a politician. Though I believed that what I’d\nattempted, and achieved, in government would prove to have safeguarded and\nstrengthened Israel, I knew that important challenges and decisions still lay ahead.\nSo did our unfulfilled dream of being a country that was not just strong, secure and\nprosperous, but socially just and at peace. Yet I believed it was right to draw my\ntime on the front line of politics to an end. Though I didn’t say so, I thought to\nmyself: this time doesn’t feel like a step back into the reserves, but genuinely like\nthe end of something. Though my dedication to a secure, strong, just, democratic\nand ultimately peaceful Israel would not change, whatever contribution I might\n431\n/ BARAK / 146\nmake to our getting there would no longer be on the battlefield, in the kirya or\naround the cabinet table.\nAs a number of reporters pointed out, when I made the announcement I was\nrelaxed. I looked content, and I was smiling.\n432",
