  "text": "By the afternoon, the national security team was experiencing a sense of rising panic:\nthe president, in their view, didn’t seem to be quite registering the situation. Bannon\nwasn’t helping. His hyperrationalist approach obviously appealed to the not-always-\nrational president. A chemical attack didn’t change the circumstances on the ground,\nBannon argued; besides, there had been far worse attacks with far more casualties than\nthis one. If you were looking for broken children, you could find them anywhere. Why\nthese broken children?\n\nThe president was not a debater—well, not in any Socratic sense. Nor was he in any\nconventional sense a decision maker. And certainly he was not a student of foreign policy\nviews and options. But this was nevertheless turning into a genuine philosophical face-off.\n\n“Do nothing” had long been viewed as an unacceptable position of helplessness by\nAmerican foreign policy experts. The instinct to do something was driven by the desire to\nprove you were not limited to nothing. You couldn’t do nothing and show strength. But\nBannon’s approach was very much “A pox on all your houses,” it was not our mess, and\njudging by all recent evidence, no good would come of trying to help clean it up. That\neffort would cost military lives with no military reward. Bannon, believing in the need for\na radical shift in foreign policy, was proposing a new doctrine: Fuck ’em. This iron-fisted\nisolationism appealed to the president’s transactional self: What was in it for us (or for\nhim)?\n\nHence the urgency to get Bannon off the National Security Council. The curious thing\nis that in the beginning he was thought to be much more reasonable than Michael Flynn,\nwith his fixation on Iran as the source of all evil. Bannon was supposed to babysit Flynn.\nBut Bannon, quite to Kushner’s shock, had not just an isolationist worldview but an\napocalyptic one. Much of the world would burn and there was nothing you could do about\nit.\n\nThe announcement of Bannon’s removal was made the day after the attack. That in\nitself was a rather remarkable accomplishment on the part of the moderates. In little more\nthan two months, Trump’s radical, if not screwball, national security leadership had been\nreplaced by so-called reasonable people.\n\nThe job was now to bring the president into this circle of reason.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nAs the day wore on, both Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell were united in their\ndetermination to persuade the president to react ... normally. At the very minimum, an\nabsolute condemnation of the use of chemical weapons, a set of sanctions, and, ideally, a\nmilitary response—although not a big one. None of this was in any way exceptional.\nWhich was sort of the point: it was critical not to respond in a radical, destabilizing way—\nincluding a radical nonresponse.\n\nKushner was by now complaining to his wife that her father just didn’t get it.
