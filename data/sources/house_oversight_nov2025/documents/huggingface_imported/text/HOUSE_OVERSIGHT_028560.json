  "text": "2 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwas when the statute was written? Or is their reference\nto that subject matter “dynamic,” changing in scope as the\nsubject matter changes over time? It is hardly surprising,\ngiven the thousands of different statutes containing an\nuntold number of different words, that there is no single,\nuniversally applicable answer to this question.\n\nFairly recent cases from this Court make that clear.\nCompare New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira, 586 U.S. _, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 7) (adopting the interpretation of “‘con-\ntracts of employment’” that prevailed at the time of the\nstatute’s adoption in 1925); Wisconsin Central Ltd. v.\nUnited States, 585 U.S. __, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 2)\n(adopting the meaning of “‘money’” that prevailed at the\ntime of the statute’s enactment in 1937); Carcieri v. Sala-\nzar, 555 U. 8. 379, 388 (2009) (interpreting the statutory\nphrase “‘now under Federal jurisdiction’” to cover only\nthose tribes that were under federal jurisdiction at the\ntime of the statute’s adoption in 1934); and Republic of\nArgentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 612-613 (1992)\n(adopting the meaning of “‘commercial’” that was “at-\ntached to that term under the restrictive theory” when the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act was enacted in 1976),\nwith Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. __,\n___ (2015) (slip op., at 14) (moting that the words “‘re-\nstraint of trade’” in the Sherman Act have been interpreted\ndynamically); West v. Gibson, 527 U.S. 212, 218 (1999)\n(interpreting the term “‘appropriate’” in Title VII’s reme-\ndies provision dynamically); and Allied-Bruce Terminix\nCos. v. Dobson, 518 U.S. 265, 275-276 (1995) Gnterpret-\ning the term “‘involving commerce’” in the Federal Arbi-\ntration Act dynamically).\n\nThe Court, like petitioners, believes that the language of\nthe statute itself helps significantly to answer the stat-\nic/dynamic question. See ante, at 7-9. I doubt that the\nlanguage itself helps in this case. Petitioners point to the\nwords “as is” in the phrase that grants the international\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028560",
