  "text": "managed to collect some 20% of the votes cast in the state. Indeed, after\nthe BJP and Congress, it got the most votes nationally of any party in the\nelection. Yet it failed to win a single constituency. By contrast the BJP not\nonly collected a huge tally of votes but also turned those efficiently into\nseats. With 31% of the national vote-share, they captured nearly 52% of\nthe seats in parliament.\n\nThat suggests an important shift in Indian politics. The BJP did\nextraordinarily well because it approached the election in a far more\nprofessional, strategic and efficient way than its rivals. The methods it\nemployed were modern, and the skill at which Mr Modi and his fellow\nleaders conducted their campaigns rivalled the sort of performances put in\nby American presidential contenders (and with similar quantities of money\nto spend). Rahul Gandhi of Congress, in the end, proved to be a hopeless\namateur, poorly advised without even decent media-management skills or\nthe ability to present a strong campaign message. Many regional figures\nproved similarly out of date in their campaigning. The BJP’s roadshows\nand rallies, the door-knocking by volunteers, the influence on India’s press\nand television channels, the ability to set the agenda of discussion, all went\nto making the election a remarkably one-sided affair. The chief minister of\nBihar, Nitish Kumar, tendered his resignation on May 17th, after his party\nwas flattened by the BJP in the state. (Assam’s chief minister, from\nCongress, has also offered to quit.) That was not because of anti-\nincumbency—voters in Bihar are happy with the work Mr Kumar has\nbeen doing—but because the BJP’s campaign was vastly superior.\n\nMr Modi in his first speeches after his victory has sounded magnanimous\nand made the right noises about running the country for all, bringing\neveryone along. He also mentioned, only partly accurately, that the BJP’s\nsuccess transcended caste politics and religious appeals. If that were\nentirely true, 1t would be another reason to call this election result historic.\nIn fact the BJP did make some use of caste and religion, as when Mr Modi\nplayed up his “other backward classes” background while campaigning in\nUttar Pradesh, or when he criticized Bangladeshi (read: Muslim)\ninfiltrators in Assam and West Bengal. It is troubling, too, that the new\nparliament will have the fewest Muslim members of any since 1952, while\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031576",
