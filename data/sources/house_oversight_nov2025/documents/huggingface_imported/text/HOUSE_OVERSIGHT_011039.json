  "text": "Negative cash flow, or transfer in, always means new investment added from\noutside. Plowback from revenue is excluded, as it is already recognized as a\ndeduction from positive cash flow. For the firm, the only source of positive cash flow\n\nis proceeds from new shares issued. With this understood,\n\ncash flow = gross cash flow - plowback - transfer in\n= earned revenue - plowback - transfer in\n= positive cash flow - negative cash flow, (6.6)\n\nwhere\n\npositive cash flow = earned revenue - plowback, and\nnegative cash flow = transfer in. (6.7)\n\nFirms use the term gross realized output to mean the same thing as what I call gross\n\ncash flow. A common definition is\n\ngross realized output = realized output + depreciation.\n\nNow we come to the subtle point allowing for deadweight loss. The total return\ntruism shows that output equals value growth plus cash flow. Then output is\nnegative wherever the sum of growth and cash flow is less than zero. Natural\ndisasters and bad investments can make them so. Those unexpected setbacks are\nexamples of deadweight loss. It amounts to unrecovered depreciation, meaning\ndepreciation not recovered (realized) in positive cash flow. I'll get back to that soon.\n\nThe point at present is that the equation above really means\n\ngross realized output = realized output + recovered depreciation.\n\nHere too | prefer the generality of “decapitalization” over “depreciation”, and define\n\ngross realized output = gross cash flow\n= realized output + recovered decapitalization\n= earned revenue + recovered decapitalizaton.
