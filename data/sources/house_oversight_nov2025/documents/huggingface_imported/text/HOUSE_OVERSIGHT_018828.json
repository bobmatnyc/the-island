Home sales in the territory, while\nstill lower than 2007 figures, have increased annually since 2012.\n\nAccording to statistical data provided by the Multiple Listing Service, the value of real estate sales in\nthe St. Thomas-St. Croix MLS grew by 54% in 2014 to nearly $200 million on 883 transactions; volume\nseen since 2008 and sales pace not seen since 2007. This growth follows 20% growth in 2013 which\ncame after six years of declines. The average sales price surpassed $300,000, a level also not seen\nsince 2008.\n\nMILS Sales Volume - St. Thomas and St. Croix\n\n$400,000,000 - : $350,000\n$340,000\n\n$350,000,000 -\n\n$330,000\n_} $320,000\n- $310,000\n$250,000,000 - $300,000\n\n$300,000,000 -\n\n- $290,000\n$280,000\n$270,000\n$260,000\n\n$100,000,000 - $250,000\n2009 2010 = 2011 2012 2013 2014\n\n$200,000,000\n\n$150,000,000\n\n== Sales Volume Average Sale Price\n\nSource: St. Thomas/St. Croix MLS\n\nReal Estate Ownership and Taxation\n\nOwnership is “fee simple”, under the U.S. flag. There are no restrictions against purchasing solely for\ninvestment, and no laws dictating when, if ever, you must build on undeveloped land. It should be\nnoted that for 2006 there was a reassessment, and the tax rate changed to $3.77 per $1,000 based on\n100% of assessed value (for residential property); however, there was an ongoing court challenge to\nthe reassessment, and a federal injunction blocked tax bills until the issue could be resolved. As of\nDecember, 2013, the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax bills have all been issued under\nthe old 1999 assessed values and tax rates. This federal court injunction regarding the tax\nreassessment of VI property values had previously prevented the government from collecting property\ntax for at least four years, resulting in the government losing USS25 million a month. New assessed\nvalues as well as amended tax rates were released in conjunction with the 2013 tax bills in August,\n2014. Subsequent tax bills were issued at a rate of two per year until August 2015 when the 2015 bill\nwere released and the Virgin Islands became current with respect to its property taxes.\n\nIGY American Yacht Harbor Marina\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018828",
