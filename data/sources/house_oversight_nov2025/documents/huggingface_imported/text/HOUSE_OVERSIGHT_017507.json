SCAROLA: Just ask your question.\n\nMS. HADDAD: I'm asking a question. If you\nhave any objection, please Jay it on the record.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: No, what J want to do is try\nto save some time.

Do you recall if this federal case was filed\nwhen you decided to use the case for your Ponzi scheme\n\nPage 68\nand show it to your investors?\n\nA. It may have been filed around that time,\nbecause I haven't been abie to establish the exact\ntime. It also certainly may have been utilized by me\nto further the Ponzi scheme.
