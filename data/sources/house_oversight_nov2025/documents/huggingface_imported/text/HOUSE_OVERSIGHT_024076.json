  "text": "Portfolio Company Leverage\n\nTo the extent that any investment is made in a portfolio company with a leveraged capital\nstructure, such investment will be subject to increased exposure to adverse economic factors\nsuch as a significant rise in interest rates, a severe downturn in the economy or deterioration in\nthe condition of such company or its industry. If such a company is unable to generate\nsufficient cash flow to meet principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, the value of\nany equity investment by the Fund in such company could be significantly reduced or even\neliminated.\n\nInvestments in Public Companies\n\nThe Fund may invest in public companies or take private portfolio companies public.\nInvestments in public companies may subject the Fund to risks that differ in type or degree\nfrom those involved with investments in privately held companies. Such risks include, without\nlimitation, greater volatility in the valuation of such companies, increased obligations to\ndisclose information regarding such companies, limitations on the ability of the Fund to dispose\nof securities at certain times (including due to the possession by the Fund of material non-public\ninformation), increased likelihood of shareholder litigation against such companies’ board\nmembers, which may include the Fund Managers or other Management Company personnel,\nregulatory action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and increased costs\nassociated with each of the aforementioned risks.\n\nHedging Techniques\n\nFrom time to time, the Fund might have investments that are publicly traded, yet illiquid. The\nGeneral Partner might engage in hedging techniques, such as selling the corresponding shares\nshort “against the box,” to “lock in” or secure the value in an investment until it becomes liquid\nand freely tradable. The Fund will only sell short a stock to the extent it holds a corresponding\nlong and illiquid position in the same company.\n\nPortfolio Trading\n\nThe Fund does not generally intend to trade its assets for short-term profits, however, when\ncircumstances warrant, securities may be sold by the Fund without regard to the length of time\nheld. Any active short-term trading of the Fund will increase its rate of turnover and related\ntransaction expenses.\n\nNon-U.S. Investments\n\nThe Fund may invest a portion of Fund’s total committed capital in the securities of issuers that\nare organized outside of the U.S. and Canada. Investing in non-U.S. securities may involve\nsubstantially greater risks than investing in U.S. securities including risks relating to (i) currency\nexchange matters, including fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the\nvarious foreign currencies in which the Fund’s non-U.S. investments are denominated, and\ncosts associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency to\nanother; (ii) differences between the U.S. and non-U.S. securities markets, including potential\nprice volatility in and relative illiquidity of some non-U.S. securities markets; (iii) the absence of\nuniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and disclosure\nrequirements, and differences in government supervision and regulation; (iv) certain economic\nand political risks, including potential exchange control regulations, potential restrictions on\nforeign investments and repatriation of capital and the risks associated with political, economic\nor social instability, diplomatic developments, and the possibility of expropriation or\n\n65 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024076",
