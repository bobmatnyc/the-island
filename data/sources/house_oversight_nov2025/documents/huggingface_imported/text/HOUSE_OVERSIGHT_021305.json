  "text": "a shared social goal. Sometimes the goal\nis spontaneous as in clapping to\ndemonstrate appreciation and sometimes\nthe goal is imposed by the situation (e.g.,\nmusicians following a musical score and\ninstructions of a conductor, soldiers\nmarching to the call of a drill sergeant).\nHowever, when we behave in synchrony\nwith others, there is a sense of becoming\npart of something larger than ourselves.\n\nTo the people engaged in\nspontaneously synchronized behavior,\nthere is a clearly identifiable and\nseemingly individual ‘cause’ for their\nemergent behavior. But when a group\nshares the same goal—demonstrating\napproval—and engages in the same\naction—clapping—the stage is set for\nsuch behavior to become coordinated\nand organized even without an external\nagent (conductor or drill sergeant). How\ndo those moments of spontaneous social\naggregation occur? How does the social\nbrain work to join with others to form\nthe emergent group?\n\nWe have begun to understand the\nunderlying dynamics of how and when\nsuch phenomena are likely to occur and\neven how such phenomena can be\npotentially engineered. New insights\nafforded by developments in social\npsychology, developmental psychology,\nand social neuroscience have suggested\nthe way in which our brains respond to\nthe invisible force of social connection.\nThese scientific developments suggest\nneural mechanisms that may be\nimportant to the way we interact with\nothers. At the same time, the insights\nalso reveal the likely conditions under\nwhich individual self merges into the\ngroup. Such situations when the sense of\nself is suspended contrast sharply with\nthe modern Western notion of the\nindividual standing apart from others.\nIndeed, the traditional Western focus on\n\nPage |59\n\nindividual-centered reasons, motives,\nintentions, and causes may be at odds\nwith some forms of spontaneously\nsynchronized behaviors and group\naction.\n\nTowards a Biology of Social\nInteraction\n\nConsider the perspective of an\nengaged spectator at a singles tennis\nmatch. Although we may be sitting\ndistant from competitors, if we identify\nwith one of the players we are not\nmerely passive observers. On the\ncontrary, our observation of the events in\nthe game can serve to activate some of\nthe same neural mechanisms that would\nbe active if we were playing the game\nrather than just observing it. We can feel\nthe moves, feel the impetus to defend an\nattack, and feel the urge to slam the ball\nas if we ourselves are playing, albeit\nwithout actually flailing our arms\naround. We may even anticipate a move\nby the opponent and imagine ourselves\nmaking the potential response. Research\nover the last 10 years or so has revealed\nthat our brains can map the movements\nof other human beings onto our own\nbodies almost as if we were making\nthose movements’. This ability to put\nourselves in another person’s shoes\nmakes it possible to identify with either\nplayer.\n\nBy comparison to the audience,\nconsider how this ability can serve us as\none of the players. This capacity\nprovides an important facility for\nanticipating our opponent’s moves\nallowing us to plan a response even\nbefore the opponent has completed a\ngroundstroke. This kind of anticipation\ndoes not depend on explicit reasoning or\nconscious reflection—it seems to operate\nas an automatic mechanism **. This\nkind of mechanism may facilitate\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021305",
