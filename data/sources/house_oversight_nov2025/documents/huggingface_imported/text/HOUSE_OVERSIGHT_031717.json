  "text": "At pivotal moments in our history, America has courageously\nconcluded that a central tenet of its foreign policy, conceived with the\nbest intentions, simply isn’t working. Hard though it’s been for this\nproud and mighty nation to admit failure, trading a losing strategy for\na fresh course has brought such triumphs as the Nixon-Kissinger pacts\nwith China that isolated the Soviet Union and helped to end the Cold\nWar.\n\nToday, America faces just such a reckoning in the Middle East. Our\nobjective is clear: halting the spread of terrorism that’s headed for our\nshores, threatening mass murder in our suburban shopping malls, city\ntunnels, and crowded parks.
