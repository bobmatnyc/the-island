  "text": "All nations have ideological divisions, but the Palestinians are\ndivided over the fundamental question of the Palestinian nation's\nidentity. Fatah sees itself as part of a secular Arab world that is on the\ndefensive. Hamas envisions the Palestinian nation as an Islamic state\nforming in the context of a region-wide Islamist rising. Neither is in a\nposition to speak authoritatively for the Palestinian people, and the\nthings that divide them cut to the heart of the nation. As important,\neach has a different view of its future relations with Israel. Fatah has\naccepted, in practice, the idea of Israel's permanence as a state and\nthe need of the Palestinians to accommodate themselves to the reality.\nHamas has rejected it.\n\nThe U.N. decision raises the stakes in this debate within the\nPalestinian nation that could lead to intense conflict. As vicious as\nthe battle between Hamas and Fatah has been, an uneasy truce has\nexisted over recent years. Now, there could emerge an internationally\nlegitimized state, and control of that state will matter more than ever\nbefore. Whoever controls the state defines what the Palestinians are,\nand it becomes increasingly difficult to suspend the argument for a\ntemporary truce. Rather than settling anything, or putting Israel on\nthe defensive, the vote will compel a Palestinian crisis.\n\nFatah has an advantage in any vote on Palestinian statehood: It enjoys\nfar more international support than Hamas does. Europeans and\nAmericans see it as friendly to their interests and less hostile to Israel.\nThe Saudis and others may distrust Fatah from past conflicts, but in\nthe end they fear radical Islamists and Iran and so require American\nsupport at a time when the Americans have tired of playing in what\nsome Americans call the \"sandbox.\" However reluctantly, while\naiding Hamas, the Saudis are more comfortable with Fatah. And of\ncourse, the embattled Arabist regimes, whatever tactical shifts there\nmay have been, spring from the same soil as Fatah. While Fatah is the\npreferred Palestinian partner for many, Hamas can also use that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031919",
