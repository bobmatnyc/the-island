  "text": "54028\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nEnterprises further maintains that the\nrequirement to ensure that the notice is\nconspicuous and not altered or defaced\nimposes an unnecessary burden on\nemployers. Caremaster Medical\nServices’ comment asks whether\nperiodic inspections of the notices will\nbe conducted and, if so, by whom.\nSpecifically, this comment expresses\nconcern that employers will be forced to\npermit union officials to enter their\nfacilities to inspect the notices. The rule\ndoes not provide for such inspections or\nalter current standards regarding union\naccess to employers’ premises. Rather,\nthe Board contemplates that an\nemployer’s failure to comply with the\nrule will be brought to the attention of\nthe employer or the Board by employees\nor union representatives who are\nlawfully on the premises.\n\nThe International Union of Operating\nEngineers comments that the rule needs\nto apply to the marine construction\nindustry, in which employees work at\nremote sites and do not necessarily see\na posting in the office. Another\ncomment similarly states that the rule is\nnot practical for small employers with\ndispersed employees, e.g., trucking or\ninsurance companies.11” Similarly, one\ncomment contends that the requirement\nis burdensome for construction\nemployers, whose employees report to\nvarious worksites.118 The Board\nrecognizes that certain work situations,\nsuch as those mentioned in the\ncomments, present special challenges\nwith regard to physical posting.\nHowever, the Board concludes that\nthese employers must nonetheless post\nthe required notice at their work\npremises in accordance with the\nproposed rule. Electronic posting will\nalso aid the employers in providing the\nnotice to their employees in the manner\nin which they customarily communicate\nwith them.\n\nTLC Companies contends that\nprofessional employer organizations\n(PEOs) such as itself should be exempt\nfrom the rule’s requirements. It explains\nthat PEOs are ‘“‘co-employers”’ of a client\nemployer’s employees, providing\npayroll and other administrative\nservices. However, it asserts that PEOs\nhave no control over the client\nemployer’s worksite. Accordingly, TLC\nCompanies is concerned that a PEO\ncould be found liable for its client’s\nfailure to post the notice. The Board\ncontemplates that employers will be\nrequired to physically post a notice only\non their own premises or at worksites\nwhere the employer has the ability to\n\n117 Comment of TLC Companies.\n118 Comment of NAI Electrical Contractors.\n\npost a notice or cause a notice to be\nposted directed to its own employees.\n\nRetail Industry Leaders Association\nasks whether the rule would apply to\noverseas employees of American\nemployers. The answer to that question\nis generally ‘‘no’’; the Board’s\njurisdiction does not extend to\nAmerican employees engaged in\npermanent employment abroad in\nlocations over which the United States\nhas no legislative control. See Computer\nSciences Raytheon, 318 NLRB 966\n(1995). Employers of employees who are\nworking abroad only temporarily are not\nrequired to post the notice in foreign\nworkplaces.\n\nb. Size and Form Requirements\n\nMany comments from organizations\nand individuals object to the 11x17-inch\nsize prescribed by the proposed rule.119\nThey argue that most employers do not\nhave the capacity to make 11x17-inch\ncolor copies and will have to use\ncommercial copy services, which some\ncontend are expensive. A human\nresources official also asserts that other\nrequired notices are smaller, and that\nthe larger poster will be more eye-\ncatching, implying that NLRA rights are\nmore important. Other comments\nsupport the proposed 11x17-inch size,\nstating that the notice should stand out\nand be in large print, with one comment\nspecifying that the title should be\nlarger.12° The AFL-CIO argues that\nemployers should not be permitted to\ndownload the notice from the Board’s\nWeb site if their limited printing\ncapacity would make it less eye-\ncatching.\n\nA few comments contend that the\nprescribed size will make it difficult to\ninclude in consolidated posters of\nvarious statutory rights, as the proposed\nrule permits.121 One comment urges the\nBoard to follow the “3’ rule,” according\nto which a notice is large enough if it\ncan be read from a distance of 3 feet,122\nand another suggests only a legibility\nrequirement.1?3 One comment states\nthat minor deviations, such as 1% inch,\nshould not be deemed violations.1?#\nAnother comment expresses a concern\nthat a large, prominent poster could\ncause a few unhappy employees to\nbegin activity that could result in\ndivisiveness in a small facility.125\n\n119 See, e.g., comment of Associated General\nContractors (AGC) of Iowa.\n\n120 See, e.g., comments of AFL-CIO and three\nGeorgetown University Law Center students.\n\n121 See, e.g., comment of Sinnissippi Centers.\n\n122 AGC of Iowa.\n\n123 Sinnissippi Centers.\n\n124 National Council of Agricultural Employers.\n\n125 Mercy Center Nursing Unit Inc.\n\nThe Board has decided to retain the\n11x17-inch poster size. As the NPRM\nstates, the Board will furnish paper\ncopies of the notice, at no charge, to\nemployers that ask for them. Employers\nthat prefer to download and print the\nnotice from the Board’s Web site will\nhave two formats available: a one-page\n11x17-inch version and a two-page 8\n¥Y2x11-inch version, which must be\nprinted in landscape format and taped\ntogether to form the 11x17-inch poster.\nIn response to the comments objecting\nto the added expense of obtaining color\ncopies through outside sources, the\nBoard has revised the rule to delete the\nrequirement that reproductions of the\nnotice be in color, provided that the\nreproductions otherwise conform to the\nBoard-provided notice. Accordingly, the\nBoard concludes that obtaining copies\nof the notice will not be difficult or\nexpensive for employers.\n\nThe Board finds no merit to the other\nobjections to the 11x17-inch poster size.\nContrary to some comments, the Board\ndoes not believe that employees would\nthink that NLRA rights are more\nimportant than other statutory rights,\nmerely because the notice of NLRA\nrights is somewhat larger than notices\nprescribed under some other statutes. It\nwould seem that, upon learning of all of\ntheir rights in the workplace, employees\nwill determine from their understanding\nof the rights themselves, rather than the\nsize of the various posters, which rights\n(if any) are more important to them than\nothers. In the Board’s view, adopting a\nsubjective ‘3’ rule” or a “legibility\nstandard” could lead to disagreements\nover whether a particular poster was\n“legible’’ or could be read at a distance\nof 3 feet. In addition, if, as some\ncomments contend (without citing\nspecifics), the size of the Board’s notice\nwill pose a problem for manufacturers\nof consolidated posters to include it\nwith posters detailing other workplace\nrights, that would seem to be a problem\nbest left to those manufacturers to solve.\n\nc. Language Issues\n\nThe proposed rule requires that,\n“Tw]here a significant portion of an\nemployer’s workforce is not proficient\nin English, the employer must provide\nthe notice in the language the\nemployees speak.” This is the same\nstandard applied in the Department of\nLabor’s notice of NLRA rights for federal\ncontractors (29 CFR 471.2(d)) and in the\nnotice required under the Family and\nMedical Leave Act (29 CFR 825.300(4)).\nMany comments support the\nrequirement and availability of\ntranslated notices, particularly as an\nessential way of informing immigrant\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022299",
