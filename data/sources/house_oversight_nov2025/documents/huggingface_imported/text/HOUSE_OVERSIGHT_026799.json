  "text": "Should hedge funds and private equity funds be\nworried about Washington? No.\n\n- There continues to be chatter about dealing with carried interest. But chatter does not\nmean action and we see little actual movement toward raising the rates on carried\ninterest through 2016.\n\n- The new “tax reform” focused on hedge funds is projected to raise $11 billion a year.\nsomehow this gets done by allowing the IRS to audit hedge funds and find this amount\nof unreported revenue annually. Good luck with that.\n\n- Private Equity has also been a focus of political chatter - maybe we see new regulation\non the burgeoning “Shadow Banking” sector? Again, chatter is not action. There is little\nchance Congress or regulators will move aggressively in this space through 2016.\n\n- But “Big Banks” continue to take it on the chin: In an effort to raise revenue for the\nHighway Trust Fund, Republicans have legislation moving forward that would drop the\nguaranteed interest rate banks receive for “investing” in the Federal Reserve — which\nthey are required to do by law - from 6 percent to 1.5 percent. This will result in a\nsignificant drop in revenues for some of the biggest banks in the US.\n\nDeutsche Bank Francis J.
