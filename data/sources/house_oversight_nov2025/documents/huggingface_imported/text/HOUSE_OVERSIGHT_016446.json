A former business\npartner, Steven Hoffenberg, sued him in 2016, claiming that Epstein was the\nmastermind behind a $500 million Ponzi scheme that Hoffenberg was\nimprisoned for in 1995. Hoffenberg served 18 years for the scam, but he later\ndropped the lawsuit against Epstein.\n\nIn August, two of Hoffenberg’s former investors rekindled the lawsuit against\nEpstein, but the case was dropped in October.\n\nEpstein and his associate, British-born socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, were also\naccused in a 2015 federal civil suit of organizing underage sex parties on his\nprivate plane, nicknamed “The Lolita Express,” and at Epstein’s various homes.\nMaxwell, who has never been charged with wrongdoing, has denied allegations\nmade in the lawsuit that she was Epstein’s “madam.” The suit, filed by victim\nVirginia Roberts, was settled in 2017.\n\n‘\n\n‘\nMie 2s 8\n\n| F\n€\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016446",
