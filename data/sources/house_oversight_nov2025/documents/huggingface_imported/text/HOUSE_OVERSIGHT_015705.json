He was not the first person to come up with the idea — that\nhonor probably goes to Charles Babbage — but he was the first to fully\nunderstand its power. When we talk about computers today we mean\nmachines, but it is worth noting computers in Turing’s time were more\noften humans using pencil and paper. The mechanical computers before\n\nTuring were elementary at best.\n\nRudimentary calculating machines were developed in Greece,\nPersia and China as far back as the Ming Dynasty. An astrolabe recovered\nfroma ship wreck off the Greek Island of Antikythera had cogs and gears\nand could accurately predict the motions of the sun and planets.
