However, the elected delegate, while able to vote in committee, cannot\nparticipate in floor votes.\n\nAt the territorial level, 15 senators—seven from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of\nSaint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large who must be a resident of Saint John—are\nelected for two-year terms to the unicameral Virgin Islands Legislature. The U.S. Virgin Islands has\nelected a territorial governor every four years since 1970. Previous governors were appointed by the\nPresident of the United States.\n\nPopulation and Employment\n\nIn 2008, the residential population of the Virgin Islands peaked at an estimated 115,852 persons. This\nfollows five years of slow but steady growth of 1.0%, slightly slower than the U.S. annual average of\n1.15%. Since 2008, population levels have fallen each year, to the 2014 estimated population of\n103,961 persons.\n\nAmong the three islands, St Croix and St Thomas are nearly equally populous with St John having less\nthan 4 percent of the total population of the Virgin Islands.\n\nUSVI Economic Indicators\n\n5 Yr Ann\n\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Growth\n\nPopulation 111,470 113,689 114,743 115,852 107,343 106,405 105,784 105,169 104,563 103,961 0.6%\n\nSt. Croix 54,635 55,722 56,239 56,783 52,612 50,601 50,247 50,005 49,938 49,656 “1.1%\n\nSt. Thomas $2,528 53,574 54,070 54,592 50,583 51,634 51,266 $1,054 50,610 50,316 0.1%\n\nSt.John 4,307 4,393 4,434 4,477 4,148 4,170 4,134 4,113 4,015 3,989 0.8%\n\nCivilian labor force 51,159 51,159 52,670 52,630 52,861 51,424 50,729 50,577 47,558 46,784 2.3%\n\n.
