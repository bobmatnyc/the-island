  "text": "An Observation from Ben Bernanke,\n\nCurrent Chairman of the Federal Reserve\n\nA famous economist once said anything that can’t go on\nforever will eventually stop, and this [government liabilities\nfrom entitlement programs] will stop, but it might stop in a\nvery unpleasant way in terms of sharp cuts, a financial crisis,\nhigh interest rates that stop growth, continued borrowing\nfrom abroad. So, clearly we need to get control of this over\nthe medium term, and specifically we’re going to have to\nlook at entitlements because that’s a very big part of the\nobligations of the federal government going forward.\n\n-- Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve\n\nTestimony before House Budget Committee, June 9, 2010\n\nKP Note: Emphasis added.\n(@)E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 249\n\nBad News: USA Inc.’s Entitlement Programs are Inflation Indexed,\n\nThus Potential Inflation — Which Would Reduce General Consumer Purchasing\nPower — Would Not Reduce Entitlement Liabilities\n\nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid Spending (All Indexed to Inflation) as % Total\nFederal Spending 1970-2020E\n\n50%\n\n20%\n\nAs Percentage of Total Outlays (%)\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\n1970 1978 1986 1994 2002 2010E 2018E\nPp Data sources: The Budget and Economic Outlook, CBO 6/10.\nwww.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 250\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020966",
