Priebus choice suggests to me that he may go for a bigger name in\ntreasury than Mnuchin. Someone to underscore/push forward this notion that he is Reagan 2.0 (as\nsome are suggesting). I am just not sure who that person would be. The Trump trade certainly seems\nto have legs -- all the Hillary loving hedgies I am talking to are congratulating themselves for making\nso much money last week. They are all Trump lovers now!\n\nLandon Thomas, Jr.\nFinancial Reporter\nNew York Times\n\nhttp://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/landon_ jr thomas/index.\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
