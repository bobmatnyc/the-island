If we let her lie without challenge then the lies become the reality and \nthat may lead to you facing investigation. These are serious allegations and In the UK prosecuting people who \nface allegations of sex abuse is now common place and a lot of resources are focused on this. \nWe can't sit back and let you be a conspirator by silence. \nYour are not guilty and must follow Dershowtiz line. He is a leading lawyer and he hasn't followed the don't say \nanything for fear of litigation. He has rightly called . bluff and shouted his innocence. \nYou have to stand up and deny the allegations or be branded guilty by association and that may lead to other \ninvestigations and worse. \nI feel I am going around in circles. \nI know what is right to do and that is to shout your innocence. \nTry and get some rest. Call me tomorrow if you want anytime. \nSpeak to Deshowitz. \nDon't allay yourself to JE as that is not the way to go. \nBest \nPhilip \nSent from my iPhone \nOn 10 Jan 2015, at 16:02, \"G Maxwell\" \nwrote: \nI am out of my depth to understanding defamation and other legal hazards and don't want to end up in a law suit \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030296 \naimed at me from anyone if I can help it. Apparently even saying is a her has hazard! I have never \nbeen in a suit criminal or civil and want it to stay that way. \nThe US lawyers for the Jane Does are filling additional discovery motions and if I speak I open my self to being \npart of discovery apparently. I am trying to stay out of litigation and not have to employ lawyers for years as I \nget lost in US legal nightmare. I stand no legal risk currently on these old charges and civil suits against Jeffrey \nWe need to consult with US lawyers on any statement I make and the complaints too \nPerhaps we make a statement of the legal risk of saying anything for potential defamation or something that \nprevents a full and frank detailed rebuttal + the press not being the place for that? Regardless, Philip plse call \njeffrey lawyer and see what you can understand from him and pehaps craft something in conjunction with him? \nEither way I think you need to speak to him to understand my risk so you can help me understand it - too may \ncooks in the kitchen and I can't make good decisions. Plse reach out to him today \n+ I have already suffered such a terrible and painful loss over the last few days that I can't even see what life \nafter press he'll even looks like - statements that don't address all just lead to more questions. .what is my \nrelationship to clinton ?
