  "text": "day, it was substantially to be the whole of pay. Now it becomes present value of a\n\nday’s pay five years off.\n\nAnother Look at Risk Theory\n\nI made the point that the boss and her secretary reveal their time preferences in the\nsecurity portfolios they assemble, and discount their pay at the same rate of return\nto reveal their human capital. Is that too simple? Does it overlook risk, or other\n\nfactors?\n\n] argued that human capital is the risker and higher-return factor because its\nexceptional versatility makes it as risky as we like, and because it is owned\ndisproportionately by the risk-tolerant young. Does that make the bosses’ or\nsecretary's human capital riskier and higher in return than her portfolio assets? It\ndoes not. She molds all capital to her single risk-preference level at her current age.\nThis is not to claim that age is the only determinant. Gender seems to count too, with\nmales usually more risk-tolerant. Bob Trivers tells us why. And there is a wealth\neffect. We tend to tolerate more risk when wealth gives us more cushion against\nsetbacks. But each of us, in present circumstances, has just so much tolerance.\nTastes are properties of owners, not of assets. We assemble and modify assets of\nboth factors to suit them. Human capital is not inherently riskier. It is riskier at the\ncollective scale only because it is owned disproportionately by the risk-prone young.\nEach cohort, from youngest to oldest, molds it to suit that cohort’s characteristic risk\nprofile. The boss and her secretary each molds all her assets of both factors to her\n\nsingle risk tolerance at the time.\n\nTweaking the Life Cycle Model\n\nI consider Ben-Porath’s life cycle model of 1967 the most important paper in 20\ncentury economics. | agree with all of it more or less. Now it needs clarification and\n\ncompletion.\n\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011051",
