  "text": "those trade-offs: you give up a little versatility, a little humanity, and get a crowd-\npleasing show). Watson is not good company, in spite of misleading ads from IBM that\nsuggest a general conversational ability, and turning Watson into a plausibly\nmultidimensional agent would be like turning a hand calculator into Watson. Watson\ncould be a useful core faculty for such an agent, but more like a cerebellum or an\namygdala than a mind—at best, a special-purpose subsystem that could play a big\nsupporting role, but not remotely up to the task of framing purposes and plans and\nbuilding insightfully on its conversational experiences.\n\nWhy would we want to create a thinking, creative agent out of Watson? Perhaps\nTuring’s brilliant idea of an operational test has lured us into a trap: the quest to create at\nleast the illusion of a real person behind the screen, bridging the “uncanny valley.” The\ndanger, here, is that ever since Turing posed his challenge—which was, after all, a\nchallenge to fool the judges—AI creators have attempted to paper over the valley with\ncutesy humanoid touches, Disneyfication effects that will enchant and disarm the\nuninitiated. Weizenbaum’s ELIZA was the pioneer example of such superficial illusion-\nmaking, and it was his dismay at the ease with which his laughably simple and shallow\nprogram could persuade people they were having a serious heart-to-heart conversation\nthat first sent him on his mission.\n\nHe was right to be worried. If there is one thing we have learned from the\nrestricted Turing Test competitions for the Loebner Prize, it is that even very intelligent\npeople who aren’t tuned in to the possibilities and shortcuts of computer programming\nare readily taken in by simple tricks. The attitudes of people in AI toward these methods\nof dissembling at the “user interface” have ranged from contempt to celebration, with a\ngeneral appreciation that the tricks are not deep but can be potent. One shift in attitude\nthat would be very welcome is a candid acknowledgment that humanoid embellishments\nare false advertising—something to condemn, not applaud.\n\nHow could that be accomplished? Once we recognize that people are starting to\nmake life-or-death decisions largely on the basis of “advice” from AI systems whose\ninner operations are unfathomable in practice, we can see a good reason why those who\nin any way encourage people to put more trust in these systems than they warrant should\nbe held morally and legally accountable. AI systems are very powerful tools—so\npowerful that even experts will have good reason not to trust their own judgment over the\n“Judgments” delivered by their tools. But then, if these tool users are going to benefit,\nfinancially or otherwise, from driving these tools through ferra incognita, they need to\nmake sure they know how to do this responsibly, with maximum control and justification.\nLicensing and bonding operators, just as we license pharmacists (and crane operators!)\nand other specialists whose errors and misjudgments can have dire consequences, can,\nwith pressure from insurance companies and other underwriters, oblige creators of AI\nsystems to go to extraordinary lengths to search for and reveal weaknesses and gaps in\ntheir products, and to train those entitled to operate them.\n\nOne can imagine a sort of inverted Turing Test in which the judge is on trial; until\nhe or she can spot the weaknesses, the overstepped boundaries, the gaps in a system, no\nlicense to operate will be issued. The mental training required to achieve certification as\na judge will be demanding. The urge to adopt the intentional stance, our normal tactic\nwhenever we encounter what seems to be an intelligent agent, is almost overpoweringly\nstrong. Indeed, the capacity to resist the allure of treating an apparent person as a person\n\n46\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016266",
