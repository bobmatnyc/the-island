  "text": "COVINGTON\n\nThe Honorable Richard Burr\nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner\nMay 22, 2017\n\nPage 3\n\nA. If the government fails to demonstrate prior knowledge of requested\nsubpoenaed documents, the act of producing those documents is testimonial.\n\nTwo Supreme Court precedents, Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976) and United\nStates v. Hubbell, as well as Hubbell’s progeny, United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313 (D.C. Cir.\n2006), inform the determination of whether a production of documents in response to a\nsubpoena has a testimonial character. Fisher involved IRS investigations in which the\ngovernment learned that the investigated taxpayers had given their attorneys tax returns\nprepared by their accountants in the years in question. The Court highlighted that the\nsubpoenaed documents belonged to the accountant and not the target of the investigation, were\n- prepared by the accountant, and are “the kind usually prepared by an accountant working on the\ntax returns of his client.” Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411. The Court concluded that insofar as the\ngovernment was not relying on the taxpayer to prove the existence of the documents, production\nof the documents was not “testimonial” because “the existence and location of the papers are a\nforegone conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's\ninformation by conceding that he in fact has the papers.” Id.\n\nIn contrast to Fisher, a case in which investigators already knew that documents existed\nand exactly where they were located, the investigators in Hubbell lacked “any prior knowledge of\neither the existence or the whereabouts” of the subpoenaed materials. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 44-\n45. Hubbell arose out of the Whitewater investigation, in which Independent Counsel Kenneth\nStarr sought broad categories of information from Webster Hubbell, a target of the\ninvestigation. The subpoena included such requests as “any and all documents reflecting,\nreferring, or relating to” the broad contours of the investigation, as well as “Hubbell's schedule\nof activities.” Id. at 41, 47. In examining the broad requests in the subpoena, the Court\nemphasized that “it [was] apparent from the text of the subpoena itself that the prosecutor\nneeded respondent’s assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce\nthose sources.” Id. at 41. The Court ruled that the acts required to respond to such a broad\nsubpoena were testimonial in nature, comparing them to “answering a series of interrogatories\nasking a witness to disclose the existence and location of particular documents fitting certain\nbroad descriptions.” Id. at 41, 43.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit applied Hubbell and\nFisher in United States v. Ponds, framing the inquiry as concerning “an act of production that,\nin its testimonial character, falls somewhere between the response to a fishing expedition\naddressed in United States v. Hubbell, and the production of documents whose existence was a\n‘foregone conclusion’ in Fisher v. United States.” United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313, 316\n(D.C. Cir. 2006). The court emphasized that “[w]Jhether an act of production is sufficiently\ntestimonial to implicate the Fifth Amendment . . . depends on the government’s knowledge\nregarding the documents before they are produced.” Id. at 320. Significantly, the Ponds court\nput the burden on the government to show that the act of production would not be testimonial,\nrequiring the government to show its pre-subpoena knowledge of the “existence, possession, and\nauthenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity such that the\ncommunication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.” Id.\nat 324 (internal citations omitted). :\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031672",
