  "text": "Rationalization of subsidies for water and electricity\n\nThe sweeping energy, water and electricity administered price changes introduced in\nDecember 2015 are a first step in the five-year fiscal consolidation and economic\ntransformation strategy. We expect further reviews of energy, water, and electricity\nprices over the medium-term. Furthermore, the likely government review of current\nlevels of fees and fines, introduction of new fees, application of a VAT and introduction\nof excise taxes on tobacco and soft drinks will also impact the Saudi consumer.\n\nSubsidy cuts on energy and utilities to add up to 1.5ppt to CPI inflation only\n\nWe estimate the December natural gas price hike on petrochemical firms, domestic\ncrude oil price hike as well as the combined gasoline and diesel price hike introduced\ncould add USS2.2bn, US$2.0bn and USS$3.8bn to central government revenues if fully\npassed to the budget (a combined 1.2% of GDP). We estimate the direct impact of these\nhigher gasoline, water and electricity prices to add 1.3-1.5ppt to CPI inflation due to\ntheir low basket weights (c.1.5%, cO.4% and 1.6% respectively). We think a 5% VAT tax\ncould add c2% of 2015 GDP in fiscal revenues over the medium-term.\n\nChart 58: Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket- consumer expenditure breakdown\nm Food and non-alcoholic beverages\n\n0.47%, Tobacco\n\n2.69% = Clothing and footwear\n3.50% & 21.70% , 7\n. = Housing, water, electricity, gas, and other\nfuels\nm Furnishings, household equipment &\nroutine household maintenance\nHealth\n\n@ Transport\n\n10.44%\n\nCommunication\n@ Recreation and culture\nEducation\n\n= Restaurants and hotels\nSource: Haver, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nSubsidies account for 15% of Almarai’s net income; 40% are related to poultry\nAlmarai continues to receive subsidies from the Saudi government, amounting to\nSAR295mn in 2015. This represents 15% of the Almarai’s 2015 net income. The\ngovernment pays subsidies based on price of subsidized feed importer, which means it\nmay increase or decrease naturally. Regarding the breakdown by business (poultry,\ndairy), it is unfixed, depending on the price of feed and ingredients. As of 2015,\nsubsidies for poultry accounted for 40% and dairy for 60%.\n\n60 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016170",
