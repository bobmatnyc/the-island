There are just too many different things I am trying to \nattend to (including imprinted green beards), \nDavid \nFrom: Robert Trivers \nDate: Sunday, March 18, 2018 at 11:22 PM \nTo: \"Haig, David\" <=111, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nSubject: <no subject> \ndear men \ni am writing you both because i am attaching a still not-quite-complete response to Peter Richerson, a gene-culture co-\nevolutionist—without the genes \ni do so because four lines down i tell the \"Gruterites\"—Gordon Getty's echo chamber—that i have added you two to the \nlist \nso here is your chance to say \"no way\" and i will delete that from the message and likewise not ask Gruter's assistant to \nadd your names to the list \nhaving said that, i find Gordon's missives much less burdensome than those from EDGE and certainly without the \negomaniacal nonsense that infects John Brockman—the key is to get the brightest minds in a room and have them tell \neach other what they think is most important—or some such nonsense \nneither David nor i can think of a single scientific advance achieved that way—most of what we do is simply \nconcentrated sustained thought directed toward the foundations of a problem \ni doubt Jeffrey has made a huge amount of money via the EDGE program \nunless you say otherwise, i will shortly send you the key Getty missives in which he asserts, i believe correctly, that \nTrump is an archetypal narcissistic psychopath—or whatever the precise term is—and that he must be opposed with full \nforce on that basis \nmeanwhile, David has heard plenty about you Jeffrey, a financial/mathematical mind of exceptional quality and you \nshould know that David is one of the very top evolutionary geneticists still breathing and my teacher on every detail \nlarge and small \nin haste and all best \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029163 \nbob \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029164",
