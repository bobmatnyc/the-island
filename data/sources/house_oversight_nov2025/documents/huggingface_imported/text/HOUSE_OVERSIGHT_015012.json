  "text": "before they set off at marine base Camp Fallujah. But the men kept their distance from the\nleathernecks. Had they spoken to the marines, the Blackwater team might have learned that the\nAmericans were already in the midst of a major offensive meant to assert control over the\nincreasingly restive city, where elements of the radical Islamist movement and remnants of Saddam's\narmy were beginning to aggressively strike back. at the American occupation\" (p. 306, The Hidden\nHistory of American at War), and perhaps this is the only thing that makes sense of the fact that\n\"Under the terms of its contract, Blackwater was supposed to supply these convoy security missions\nwith two SUVs, each carrying three guards per vehicle; a driver, one man riding shotgun, and a third\nman in back with a heavy machine gun. Instead, the foursome set out that morning with just two men\nper car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a steel plate as\nextra armor. And the men had not been given maps.” (p. 305).\n\nStarr went on to defend Jeffrey Epstein abasing allegations of child sex trafficking - \"Along with a\ndream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz]\nwas successful in getting federal investigators not to charge Epstein with moving his victims across\nstate lines and other associated crimes. The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein's legal team\nnegotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and\nunnamed \"potential co-conspirators\" in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who\nallegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them” (-\nhttp://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...). Otherwise, Epstein's eventual 18\nmonth sentence by the state of Florida was exceptionally light under the circumstances to include the\nnumber of victims who came forward with testimony. This is best understood in the context of children\nbeing used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of leverage.\n\nSee here Erik Prince in greater context: (the similarities between him and once (secretly) favored\nchild Bin Laden)\n\nThe coordinations among global intelligence to make rather than eliminate terror as seen thru\n\"assets\" bin Laden (as M. Noriega before him) & Erik Prince:\n\nAbout BL: \"Some CIA officers will later say that [BL] serves as a semi-official liaison between the GIP\n[Saudi intel.] and warlords like Sayyaf.”\n(www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=ahmed_badeeb_ 1)\n\nAbout EP: “Handcuffed by politics, the CIA had not been able to cultivate relationships with the key\nbut messy leaders. Fortunately, Blackwater had no such political restrictions.” (p. 54, Civilian Warriors\nby E. Prince)\n\nWe see also:\n\nAbout BL: \"Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained\nvolunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic\nRepublic of Afghanistan” (Wikipedia)\n\nAbout EP: \"In his autobiography, he states that during the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, he\nrealized the need for private training facilities for special operations... Prince moved to Virginia Beach\nand personally financed the formation of Blackwater Worldwide in 1997. He bought 6,000 acres (24\nkm2) of the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina and set up a school for special operations”\n(Wikipedia)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015012",
