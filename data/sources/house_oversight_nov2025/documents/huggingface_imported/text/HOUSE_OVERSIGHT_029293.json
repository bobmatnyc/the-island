If you are in town, meet?\n\nWhen convenient, I’d like you to meet Peter Getzels, Closer To Truth producer/director (I’ve worked with\nPeter for 12 years); he would very much like to meet you in person, describe the Radical Breakthroughs\nprocess in detail, get your feedback. He would come up from DC. We can always do Skype, of course, but\nPeter would appreciate to meet in person early in the process. Breakthroughs is a Big Project, big opportunity\nfor impact. All are truly excited.\n\nBelow are highlights of Breakthroughs progress.\n\nAttached is latest CNN on trade war and below are links (caution: a few weeks old is ancient history in Trump\ntime).\n\nThe US trade war against China: The view from Beijing\nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d514f3551544f78457a6333566d54/share_p.html\n\nHow should China handle the trade war?\nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d774d3449544d79457a6333566d54/share_p.html\n\nLove to discuss stuff.\n\nRobert\n\nRadical Breakthrough Development Work\n\n* Research on each of the 13 episodes is ongoing and we are moving towards creating a short list of the top\ncontributors per episode (with some contributors in multiple episodes).\n\n* We are aggregating the top contributors around 4 to 5 central locations, such as SF Bay Area, LA, Chicago,\nBoston, New York, Santa Fe, London, Oxford, and Cambridge for the main shoots.\n\n* We are creating a short list of locations for the secondary shoot - i.e. the more observational shoots on\nspecific labs and research facilities, such as the Music Lab at McGill, the Sleep Lab at Harvard.\n\n* We are planning a recce in the autumn to assess locations and meet some of the key contributors.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029293",
