  "text": "98 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\n,\n\nee\n\nEinstein’s Brain\n\nof the brain. Whether this is related to his highly creative thinking or just\nrandom chance is unknown, but it’s an interesting data point in our quest\nto understand creativity and intelligence.\n\nLooking through a microscope, the wrinkly grey matter is composed\nof 30 trillion neurons; small whitish cells sprouting filaments that wrap\naround each other like the tentacles of an octopus. The tentacles, and\nthere can be as many as 10,000 per cell, are known as dendrites and spread\nout to nearly touch other neurons. At the other end of the neuron is a\nsingle axon. The gaps between the end of an axon and the next neuron’s\ndendrites are called synapses, about one-tenth of the width of a human\nhair and varied in structure. When a nerve ‘fires, an electrical pulse\nspreads out along the axon to the end and crosses the synapses to other\nbrain cells. This electrical pulse is not like the flow of current in a wire:\nneurons don't conduct electricity. It is more akin to dominoes falling in\na line. Ion gates in the walls of the neuron open, letting potassium ions\nflow out. As the gates open in one section, the next section is triggered\nand so on. Thus, electrical signals ripple out along the axon. As the\nelectrical signals cross the synapses they either excite or inhibit the firing\nof adjacent neurons. There is a lot more structure to a neuron than was\nonce thought. The textbook model is of a sequence of ion sacks stacked\nend to end rather like plant cells, but neurons have a far more complex\nstructure. Bundles of actin and tubulin form a skeleton in the neuron and\nthe neuron metabolizes ATP to recharge its firing mechanism. Neurons\nbehave far more like small animals than inanimate plant cells.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015788",
