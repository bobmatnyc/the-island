  "text": "with terror attacks, a major military response was highly unlikely. Saddam’s\nsuccessors were never going to be Zionists. But we were persuaded that his\nuniquely central role meant the threat to Israel would be dramatically reduced.\n\nI’m much less sure whether the elder President Bush, whose election defeat\nto Bill Clinton came just two days before our final exercise in the Negev, would\nhave agreed with the attack. After the victory in the Gulf War, Bush had\ndeliberately stopped short of sending American forces on to Baghdad. He was\nalso vice-president, under Reagan, when Israel had bombed Saddam’s nuclear\nreactor — an attack publicly condemned by Washington. I did ask him some\nyears ago whether the Gulf War might have been handled differently if Israel\nhadn’t taken out Saddam’s nuclear program a decade earlier. “What if he’d had\na couple of crude nuclear devices,” I said. President Bush smiled in response.\nHe said he didn’t deal with “hypotheticals.”\n\nYet any idea of an Israeli attack on Saddam became instantly irrelevant once\nforeign media reports had disclosed the reason for our ill-fated military exercise\nin the Negev. Inside Israel, the focus, and the controversy, shifted to the\naccident itself.\n\nThe foreign media reports of the operation we were planning proved\nremarkably accurate. Some of the details still remain classified, but we were\ngoing to use one of our new “stand-off” weapons systems: a camera-guided\nmissile that could be fired from a considerable distance away and, in\ncoordination with one of the Sayeret Matkal soldiers nearer in, maneuvered in\nfor the strike. After months of planning and intelligence work, we were\nconfident that we’d found a way to get the sayeret unit into Iraq, target Saddam\nat an event we knew he would be attending, isolate and kill him with minimal\ndanger of any other casualties, and get our unit out safely again. The Negev\nexercise was a run-through of the entire operation. It lasted nearly 48 hours. And\nit culminated in a simulation of the missile attack on Saddam.\n\nI was there as an observer along with Amnon Lipkin, my deputy chief-of-\nstaff; as well as the head of military intelligence, the head of operations and\nAmiram Levin. We assembled at dawn for the simulation of the missile attack.\nWe watched from a few hundred yards away as a group of young Israeli soldiers\nwalked into a wide area in front of us: posing as Saddam” and his entourage.\nWe — and they — knew that this was just the first part of the exercise. In a Land\nRover more than five miles away, a member of the sayeret strike unit would be\nconfirming coordinates and, in rapid succession, “firing” two of the precision\nmissiles. But this was just to confirm that the targeting system had worked\n\n247\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011718",
