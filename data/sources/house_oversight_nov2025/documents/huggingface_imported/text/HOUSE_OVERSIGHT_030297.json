  "text": "aimed at me from anyone if I can help it. Apparently even saying is a lier has hazard! I have never\nbeen in a suit criminal or civil and want it to stay that way.\n\nThe US lawyers for the Jane Does are filling additional discovery motions and if I speak I open my self to being\npart of discovery apparently. I am trying to stay out of litigation and not have to employ lawyers for years as I\nget lost in US legal nightmare. I stand no legal risk currently on these old charges and civil suits against Jeffrey\nWe need to consult with US lawyers on any statement I make and the complaints too\n\nPerhaps we make a statement of the legal risk of saying anything for potential defamation or something that\nprevents a full and frank detailed rebuttal + the press not being the place for that? Regardless, Philip plse call\njeffrey lawyer and see what you can understand from him and pehaps craft something in conjunction with him?\nEither way I think you need to speak to him to understand my risk so you can help me understand it - too may\ncooks in the kitchen and I can't make good decisions. Plse reach out to him today\n\n+ | have already suffered such a terrible and painful loss over the last few days that I can't even see what life\nafter press he'll even looks like - statements that don't address all just lead to more questions..what is my\nrelationship to clinton ? Andrew on and on.\n\nLet's rest till monday.
