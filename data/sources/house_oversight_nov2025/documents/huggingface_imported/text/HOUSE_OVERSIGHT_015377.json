  "text": "rhetoric, | wrote to the Justice Department to find out the status of their\ncase against Groucho, and received this reply:\nDear Mr. Krassner:\nResponding to your inquiry, the Supreme Court has held that Title\n18 U.S.C., Section 871, prohibits only “true” threats. It is one thing\nto say that “I (or we will kill Richard Nixon” when you are the\nleader of an organization which advocates killing people and\noverthrowing the Government; it is quite another to utter the words\nwhich are attributed to Mr. Marx, an alleged comedian. It was the\nopinion of both myself and the United States Attorney in Los\nAngeles (where Marx's words were alleged to have been uttered)\nthat the latter utterance did not constitute a “true” threat.\nVery Truly Yours,\nJames L. Browning, Jr.\nUnited States Attorney\nIt would later be revealed that the FBI had published pamphlets in the\nname of the Black Panthers, advocating the killing of cops, and that an FBI\nfile on Groucho Marx had indeed been started, and he actually was labeled\na “national security risk.” | phoned Groucho to tell him the good news.\n“| deny everything,” he said, “because | lie about everything.”\nHe paused, then added, “And everything | denyis a lie.”\nThe last time | saw Groucho was in 1976. He was speaking at the Los\nAngeles Book Fair. He looked frail and unsmiling, but he was alert and\n\nirascible as ever. He took questions from the audience.\n\n“Are you working on a film now?”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015377",
