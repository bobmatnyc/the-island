Sometimes I read\nit just for fun!\n\nSecondly: it may help not to prioritize orgasms. I am not saying orgasms aren't important;\nI just don't want the importance of orgasms to wound you, the way it wounded me. For\nme, it is helpful to imagine sex as a journey. For me, it helps to focus on having fun\nthroughout, instead of doing what it takes to reach the \"goal\" of orgasm. If you're not\ntaking pleasure in the journey -- or at least indulging some curiosity -- then why keep\ngoing? Why not stop and try something else?\n\nExperimenting sexually in an open-ended way has been, for me, the most productive\npossible attitude. And in fact, once I knew how to make myself come, I discovered that --\nthough it's helpful to be able to attain that release if I really want to -- orgasms aren't\nactually my favorite part of sex! There are lots of other things I like better.\n\nIt's also worth noting that our definitions of \"orgasm\" are fairly narrow. Some research\nindicates that there may be other ways to conceptualize orgasms than the stereotypical\ngenital-focused approach.\n\nThirdly, although it's possible for a person to explore sexuality on her own, relationships\ncan make or break the process. We all make some compromises for romance. But when\nwe compromise, we should know what we're compromising, and we should think about\nwhether the compromise is worth it.\n\nFor me, sexual exploration and satisfaction are incredibly important -- but it took ages to\ndevelop the courage to put my foot down about them. After my boyfriend shouted at me\nthat he didn't care about my sexual satisfaction, it took me an embarrassingly long time to\nend things with him; I really was in love, and we'd been together for years. But my\nsexuality wasn't even close to a priority for him, and breaking up with him was one of the\nbest decisions I ever made.\n\nAfter ending that relationship, I was able to build my self-confidence and self-esteem\nwith new boyfriends surprisingly fast -- and my boyfriends helped me more than they\nprobably know. I owe countless small debts to men who accepted my inability to orgasm,\ntook my anxieties about it into account, and sometimes gently pushed me to try new\nthings.\n\nOne particular guy comes to mind: I told him I couldn't come, but that I wanted to\nexperiment with S&M, so we arranged to buy rope and some painful equipment. During\nour conversation, he gently drew me out on my history, and then he said, \"You know\nwhat I think we need to go along with this rope? A vibrator.\"\n\nI blinked and said hesitantly, \"I don't know, I've never really liked vibrators.\" But I was\nwilling to try it again, and that's when I learned that vibrators are awesome. That's when I\nlearned that what I really need is to convince myself I'm not in charge -- that once the\ncorrect fantasy is in place, vibrators make everything easy.\n\nEven today, few things make me happier than a man who grasps the tension I still\nsometimes feel about \"being demanding\" or \"asking for too much.” I communicate with\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018507",
