  "text": "Tne\n\nGIory\nOf Golo\n\nUber publicist Peggy Siegal has been\nattending the Academy Awards for three\ndecades—not to mention the oodles of\nparties and sensational events leading\nup to the ceremony—and chronicling\nher escapades with\nstars and star-makers\nfor AVENUE has\nbecome a tradition.\nThis year, she sets\nthe stage for the big\nnight with the behind-\nthe-scenes scoop on\nthe fierce competition\nthat ends when Oscar\nis presented. Here, she reports on the\nHollywood glamour, excitement and social\nshenanigans, including celebrating with\nColin Firth, Jesse Eisenberg, Elton John,\nOprah Winfrey and many more.\n\nphotographs by PATRICK MCMULLAN\n\n64 | AVENUE MAGAZINE - APRIL 2011\n\naddafi is hunkering\ndown in Tripoli, giving\npress interviews, denying\nthat rebels are taking\nover Eastern Libya. Oil\nprices are shooting up over one hundred\ndollars a barrel. The U.S. government is on the\nverge of a shutdown. These are not the top-\nsecret opening lines of Aaron Sorkin’s new\nscript, but the global headlines of a world\nspinning out of control as I head to Los\nAngeles like an overdressed lemming to attend\nthe 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to\nmake sense of artists thrust into combat.\n\nFor the second year, nearly 6,000 Academy\nmembers have nominated 10 films and the\nbattle seems to be pared down to 2. The\nbeloved instant classic, The King’s Speech,\nmarches into the arena as the frontrunner, but\npassionate supporters of the edgier (critics’\ndarling) The Social Network have not conceded.\nThe ballots are counted, the party invites are\nout and still the feelings are raw. Nominees are\nexhausted from campaigning.\n\nWoody Allen and George Lucas tell me they\nare no longer members of the Academy\nbecause pitting artists against each other to\ndetermine the quality of their work is insane.\nThey are right. My event and publicity company\nis considered Switzerland by the studios, as\nwe help every filmmaker to present his work.\nHowever, this year, against my better judgment,\nIam somewhat emotionally sucked in.\n\nIn 2005, I met the unknown 32-year-old\nEnglish director Tom Hooper on his first film\nfor HBO, Elizabeth I starring Helen Mirren.\nHelen later wins an Oscar for portraying\nQueen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen\nElizabeth is the daughter of King George VI,\nportrayed by Oscar-winner Colin Firth in The\nKing’s Speech directed by Hooper. No degrees\nof separation.\n\nAt the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Hooper\nbathed in the glory of a hysterical standing\novation alongside Colin Firth and Geoffrey\nRush at the very first public screening of that\nfilm. Two weeks later at The Toronto Film\nFestival, Harvey Weinstein stood with his\nfilmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The\nfilm won The Audience Prize. Their strategy\nwas to say nothing, do nothing. They have a\npossible Oscar winner—four out of five past\nBest Pictures have premiered in Toronto.\n\nCut to New York City at the end of\nSeptember. It’s opening night at The Film\n\nSociety of Lincoln Center. One of America’s most important\nand prolific producers, Scott Rudin, along with Jesse\nEisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin, are in a\nbrightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical\naudience who have just seen The Social Network. The film\nopens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity.\nDavid Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\nAaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate\nshoo-in for the adapted screenplay Oscar.\n\nThe Hamptons International Film Festival in October\nsuddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where\nstar-cum-Yale/NYU student James Franco appears. More\nOscar buzz. Producer/director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for\nSlumdog Millionaire) stays in London all fall directing the play\nFrankenstein. Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as\nMadonna, Alec Baldwin and Harvey Weinstein slip in the\nback. Darren Aronofsky is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is\ninstantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. Both films are sen-\nsations, but it’s The King’s Speech that wins The Audience Prize.\n\nMid-November: David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg\nsneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in\ncheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, “Clint Eastwood is\ngoing to kill himself for not directing this.” He says, “Youre\nwrong. He turned it down because he’s done it. He’s seen it\nand he loves it.” David O. Russell becomes my new Clint\nEastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the\nsupporting actors to beat.\n\nTrue Grit, directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced\nby Scott Rudin, finally throws its cowboy hat in the ring in\nmid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar\ncontender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold.\n\nThe Social Network now cements its battle cry with one\nword: relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of\nTime Magazine as “Person of the Year.” A smart and extensive\nad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and\npundits proclaim the race is over. Everyone goes on holiday.\n\nThis is one of the few times in Harvey Weinstein’s life that\nhe’s caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of\n15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including\nChristmas. They’re like a Chinese restaurant: always open. He\nsends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hooper to every\ncorner of the country doing Q&As until they are both blue in\nthe face from “finding their voice.” SAG voters begin seeing\nthe film two and three times.\n\nIn January at the Golden Globes, about 88 foreign journalists\ngive awards to The Social Network for Best Drama, Director\nand Screenplay. The film is still perceived as the Oscar winner\nand nobody can stop the steamroller. Only Academy voters\ndisregard these awards.\n\nThe King’s Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Everyone is totally\nsurprised when Tom Hooper goes on to win the DGA. After\na tremendous amount of hard work by team Weinstein, the\nactors win for the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced\ntheir lead; the film is now the frontrunner. It takes the media\na few weeks to catch on.\n\n|\n\nix\n\n\\\n\nGraydon and Anna\ni Scott Carter |\n/\n“ihe!\n\na\n\n*\n\nSandra\nBullock\n\nTom Hooper\n\nCarolina —\n\nHerrera\nCollin Firth and\nAnne Hathaway\n\n~ HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012700",
