  "text": "nonhuman phenomena. In this way,\nanthropomorphic language incorporates\nhuman society in a web of ethical\nobligations that connect to the natural\nenvironment and, by imaginative\nextension, to the universe as a whole.\nAlthough the drive toward social\nconnection is a general human trait,\nhowever, persons neither seek nor find\nsatisfaction in a generalized sense of\nconnection. Instead, satisfying social\nconnections are sought and experienced\nin terms of the social norms and values\nof particular historical and cultural\nsettings. Likewise, anthropomorphism,\nas an inferred social connection to the\nnonhuman, takes shape and becomes\npersuasive in terms of historically and\nculturally specific assumptions about\nsociety and social relations. This\nchapter will, therefore, step back from\n“Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,”\nin order to describe how contemporary\nscholarship in social neuroscience and in\nthe history of religions provides a fresh\npoint of view on the workings of\nanthropomorphic perception and then\ntest that interpretive model by\nreappraising Edwards’s famous sermon\nin its historical context.\n\nThe Boundary of the Human\n\nThe line between the human and\nthe nonhuman is, perhaps, the most\nconsequential presupposition that any\nsociety, group, or individual adopts\nabout life in the world. The way various\ncultures draw this line, between “us” and\n“the other,” has shaped civilizations and\ntheir goals as well as the norms of\npersonal conduct and identity. Although\nconcepts of the human have a long and\ncontentious philosophical history, people\nin their everyday lives show remarkable\nconsensus in the features they use to\ndefine “human.” Central to this process\nof perceiving the human is a perception\n\n104\n\nPage\n\nof mind in other agents, including the\npresence of goal-directed agency,\nemotions such as anger, guilt, or pride, a\ncapacity for self-awareness, and free\nwill. As Nick Epley demonstrated in the\npreceding chapter, the perception of\nthese distinctively human traits—“seeing\ninvisible minds”—1is a psychological\nmechanism with tremendous influence\non the way humans order and understand\ntheir social environment.\n\nMind perception is such a\npowerful tool of inductive inference,\nhowever, that it regularly crosses the line\nit has itself drawn between the human\nand the nonhuman. Scholars from a\nwide array of disciplines have long\nobserved humans’ anthropomorphic\ntendency to see nonhuman things or\nevents as humanlike, imbuing the real or\nimagined behavior of nonhuman\nphenomena with human motivations,\nagency, and emotions. By perceiving\nthe world in terms of human capacities\nand social relationships,\nanthropomorphism builds a complex\nsystem of analogies that uses knowledge\nof what it is like to be a person, in order\nto interpret the behavior of animals, the\nfunction of technological devices, the\noperation of complex social systems\nsuch as “the market,” or natural\noccurrences such as violent weather\npatterns or catastrophic events.” Hence,\nanthropomorphism, as a process of\ninference that not only draws but also\ncrosses the line between the human and\nthe nonhuman, has very substantial\nconsequences for the human sense of\nconnection to nonhuman animals, to\nlarger ecological systems, and to the\nstructure of the universe taken as a\nwhole.\n\nContemporary psychological\nresearch has created an intellectual space\nthat opens the phenomenon of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021350",
