I write this article as a law professor, not as a judge. It is not intended to\ncomment on any pending cases and implies no positive commitment on legal issues that may arise in cases that come before me\nin my court.\n\nText\n\n[*837]\nI. Introduction\n\nCrime victims are virtually absent from the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The sixty federal rules comprehensively\ncover every aspect of federal criminal proceedings - from initial appearance through preliminary hearing, arraignment,\nacceptance of pleas, trial, and sentencing. Yet the rules substantively mention victims only once, briefly recognizing the right\nof some victims to speak at sentencing. !\n\nThe federal rules can no longer leave victims unmentioned. In October 2004, Congress passed and President Bush signed into\nlaw the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA).\n? The CVRA transforms crime victims into participants in the criminal justice process by (among other things) guaranteeing\nthem notice of court hearings, the right to attend those hearings, and the opportunity to testify at appropriate points in the\nprocess. These new victims’ rights will reshape the federal criminal justice system and force significant changes to the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure to reflect the victim's expanded role. This Article offers comprehensive proposals for changing the\nfederal rules to both implement the CVRA and reflect sound public policy. The CVRA dictates changes like these to the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure because only by integrating victims into the federal rules will Congress's goal of making victims\nparticipants in the process be fully realized.\n\nThis Article 1s divided into five parts. Following this introduction, Part II reviews the current absence of victims from the\nfederal rules. Surprisingly, even where the rules cover issues of great concern to victims, victims somehow go unmentioned.\n\n' See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(B); discussion infra note 3 and accompanying text.\n\n? Crime Victims’ Rights Act, Pub. L. No. 108-405, 178 Stat. 2261 (2004) (codified at /8 U.S.C.A. 3771 (West 2004 & Supp. 2005)). The\nCVRA was part of a much larger piece of legislation that addressed a variety of subjects, known as the \"Justice for All Act.” See generally\nSteven J. Twist, On the Wings of Their Angels: The Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, Nila Lynn Crime\nVictims' Rights Act, 9 Lewis & Clark L. Rev.
