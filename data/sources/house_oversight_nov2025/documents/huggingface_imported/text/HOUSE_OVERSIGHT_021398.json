  "text": "these portrayals are rooted in the\ndifferent aspects of human connections,\nand each is grounded in a social context.\nSocial connection can be intimate,\nrelational, or collective. For the member\nof the Vineyard Church, connection with\nGod is an intimate two-way relationship,\nwhile in Jonathan Edwards’s sermon in\nthe Great Awakening, the connection is\nrelational and involves the coherence (or\nlack of it) of the individual with God’s\napproval. And the Christian theological\nview of connection as a higher order can\nbe conceived in terms of one’s belonging\nwithin a whole that God’s constancy\nmakes larger than oneself.\n\nWhile religion certainly speaks to\nindividual connection to others and to\nthe divine, religious practices can also\nserve an evolutionary and social function\nby strengthening the human capacity for\nattending to the personhood of those\nwho are sick and diminished. The\nobjectivity of medical science all too\noften leads to an objectification of the\npatient or, more frequently, the patient’s\ndisease. The social brain’s capacity to\nsee others as minds rather than objects\nmakes it possible to assign meaning to\npatients and the ways in which they lack\nwholeness.\n\nCrescat scientia; vita excolatur\n\nThe possibility that religion and\nscience can enrich one other, even as one\nsets aside truth claims about such\nmatters as the existence of a deity, is by\nno means obvious. But we have come to\nsee that science can describe what\nreligion does in rigorous ways that\nbenefit religion, and religion can serve a\nmeaning-making function that science\nitself disclaims. Gilpin notes that rifts\nbetween science and religion “have\ncentered on whether one can make\nscientific sense of the notion of divine\n\n152\n\nPage\n\nmind, purpose, or intention.” Our\nnetwork sidestepped this question from\nthe beginning, focusing instead on\nrelated matters such as the consequences\nof believing in such a mind, and of\nseeing into that mind, for the one doing\nthe divining.\n\nThose are questions amenable to\nempirical investigation, and it is at that\njuncture that we can see benefit from our\ndiscussions. As Berntson says, “beliefs\ncolor the way we perceive the world,\nthey direct and shape our actions, and\ndefine our personalities.” Studying and\ndebating about how they do so has been\ngratifying and immensely enjoyable.\nWe have engaged in no theological\ndebate, but have focused on questions\nabout human beings, their beliefs, their\nbehaviors, and how those things affect\nand are affected by multiple levels of\nhuman connection.\n\nHow we conceptualize our\nrelationships to persons and things\noutside our selves has implications for\nour health and well-being. Specifically,\nwe have seen that viewing our\nrelationships in terms of meaningful\nconnections with other minds can have\npositive implications for individual — as\nwell as social — health and function. The\nmore that we can learn about those\nimplications, the more our increase in\nknowledge has the potential to enrich\nhuman life.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021398",
