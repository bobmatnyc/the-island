Indeed, six years\nago, Amazon had been offering roughly 5,000 products, which has quadrupled to over\n\n2\n\n20,000 products today.\nFigure 21 Over 20K Hemp Oil SKUs Offered by Amazon Today...

What is more, CBD seems to be\nthe most popular among Caucasians, following by Hispanic / Latino consumers.\nMeanwhile, CBD use is slightly more popular among women (7.0% incidence), vs. men\n(6.7% incidence).\n\nFigure 23 CBD Over-Indexes with Low- Figure 24 ...Young Consumers (Ages 18-34)...
