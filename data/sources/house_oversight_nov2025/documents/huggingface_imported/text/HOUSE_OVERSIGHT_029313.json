Unlike\nopposite-sex couples, for example, there are\nno survivor benefits for the surviving spouse\nof a same-sex married couple. Also, the di-\nvorced spouse of a formerly married same-\nsex couple cannot not claim benefits based\non the earnings of his or her ex-spouse.\n\nIMPACT. The Social Security Adminis-\ntration (SSA) has based federal rights to\nbenefits on whether marital rights exist\nin the couples current state of residence\nrather than the state in which they were\nmarried. The impact of Windsor on the\nmanner in which federal agencies will\ntreat Social Security benefits remains to\nbe sorted out.\n\nWhen an individual\n\ndies, his or her surviving spouse may be\n\nSurvivor Benefits.\n\neligible for Social Security benefits if the\nsurviving spouse is age 60 or older, age 50\nor older and disabled, or any age if he or\nshe is caring for the decedent’s child who is\nyounger than age 16 or disabled and enti-\ntled to Social Security benefits on the record\nof the deceased individual. With DOMA\nhaving been struck down, survivor benefits\npreviously available only to opposite-sex\nmarried couples are now presumably avail-\nable to same-sex married couples. The SSA\nis expected to provide guidance.\n\nDivorced Spouses. If an individual is di-\nvorced, his or her ex-spouse may qualify\nfor Social Security benefits based on that\nindividual’s earnings. Generally, a divorced\nspouse must have been married to the in-\ndividual for at least 10 years and have been\ndivorced at least two years. Additionally,\nthe divorced spouse must be at least age\n62, unmarried and ineligible for an equal\nor greater benefit based on his or her own\nearnings or the earnings of someone else.\n‘These benefits are now presumably available\nto divorced individuals who were previously\nin a same-sex marriage. The SSA is expected\nto provide guidance.\n\nDeath Benefits. The SSA pays a one-\ntime death benefit of $255 to the dece-\ndent’s surviving spouse in an opposite-sex\nmarriage or minor child. The SSA will\npresumably now pay the one-time death\nbenefit to the surviving spouse in a same-\nsex marriage.\n\nEFFECTIVE-DATE ISSUES\n\nDetermination of the effective date for ap-\nplying the Supreme Court's holding to fed-\neral tax law is not straightforward in all cases\nand will necessitate further guidance from\nthe IRS. Same-sex married couples who\nwere not considered married under federal\nlaw prior to the Supreme Court decision\nare presumably not just considered married\nstarting on the date of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision, June 26, 2013 but are considered\nmarried retroactively to the date of their\nmarriage pursuant to state law. This retro-\nactive effective date raises a number of im-\nmediate federal tax issues:\n\nm Should same-sex couples now file\namended returns claiming joint return\nstatus?\n\nm Are same-sex couples now required to\namend past-year returns for joint status\neven if they did better tax-wise overall\nby filing separately as unmarried indi-\nviduals?\n\nm Will the IRS consider the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in determining marital\nstatus when auditing prior-year returns?\n\nAmended Joint Returns/Claims For Re-\nfund. Amended returns are filed to correct\nerrors made on previous returns. Although\nthe Internal Revenue Code does not specifi-\ncally permit amended returns, the IRS usu-\nally accepts them. But while the IRS’s dis-\ncretion to accept or reject amended returns\nhas been recognized, courts have required\nthe IRS to accept amended returns where\nits rejection of them has been found to be\narbitrary and unjust.\n\nLimitations Period. The statute of limita-\ntions for amending or auditing a return is\n\nSTATES THAT\nRECOGNIZE SAME-SEX\nMARRIAGE\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware(1)\n\nlowa\n\nMaine\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMinnesota(2)\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew York\n\nRhode Island(2)\n\nVermont\n\nWashington\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\n*As of June 27, 2013\n\n(1) Effective July 1, 2013\n\n(2) Effective August 1, 2013\n\nNote: California granted marriage li-\ncenses to same-sex couples from June\n16, 2008 to November 5, 2008.\nNote: The Little Traverse Bay Bands of\nOdawa Indians in Michigan, the Coquille\nNative American Nation in Oregon and\nthe Suquamish Native American Nation in\nWashington recognize same-sex marriage.\nNote: 37 States have laws expressly\nrestricting marriage to opposite-sex\ncouples.\n\nSTATES THAT\nRECOGNIZE SAME-SEX\nUNIONS/DOMESTIC\nPARTNERSHIPS\n\nCalifornia\nColorado\nHawaii\nIllinois\nNevada\nNew Jersey\nOregon\nWisconsin\n\ngenerally three years from the filing date or\ntwo years from the date taxes are paid, which-\never is later.
