Garcetti stated that Los\nAngeles and China “have closely integrated economies, closely integrated cultures and\nclosely integrated geography. ... We hope to be the leading Chinese city in America\n\nfor investment, tourism and students.”!”\n\nSometimes federalism, in the form of local leaders’ independent China policies,\n\nis a good thing and may, during times of upheaval in Washington, DC, help to\n\noffset unwise national policies. But if US-China relations continue on their current\ndownward trajectory, there will be an increased danger that independent state and\nmunicipal China policies will sometimes conflict with national interest and hinder the\nUnited States in its competition with China to shape global norms\n\nand practices. As China’s wealth and ambition grow and as Beijing is becoming more\nadept at turning local American “China interests” into Chinese leverage, sub-national\nAmerican governmental entities that formed their China policies in the Era of\nEngagement must become mindful that a new era will require them to develop new\n\nstrategies for a new Era of Competition.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nThe following practices can foster the kind of constructive vigilance that local\n\ngovernments will need to exercise in their continued cooperation with China.\n\nPromote Transparency\n\nSub-national governments should:\n\ne Not have secret agreements with Chinese entities, including foundations,\ncorporations, or individuals. All MOUs and contracts should be transparent\nand public. All cooperative proposals should be subject to public hearings.\nAll potential projects should receive the same due diligence that partnerships\nwith American entities would demand. No exceptions to American laws or best\npractices should be made to placate allegedly “Chinese” customs. And in no way\nshould China be allowed to have a veto over potential exchanges with other\n\ncountries, entities, or individuals such as Taiwan or the Dalai Lama.\n\ne Share experiences and concerns with peers through the National Conference of\nMayors, the National Governors Association, the National Council of County\n\nAssociation Executives, and the National Conference of State Legislatures.
