What is the contemplated procedure for, and timing of, the payment of attorney's fees and costs?\n\nIn any event, I need to consider these issues carefully and I cannot agree to any of these issues before we speak.

(USAFLS)\"\nSent: 09/27/2007 10:51 AM AST\n\nTo: Jay Lefkowitz\n\nSubject: Conference Call with Bert Ocariz\n\nHi Jay — Bert's firm has raised a number of good questions about how they are going to get paid\nand setting up a procedure that avoids any conflict of interest with their clients. Are you around\ntoday to do a conference call? Let me know what times work for you because Bert wants to get\ntheir conflicts counsel on the call with us.\n\nThese are some of the questions he sent to me. I told Bert that as part of our agreement we (the\nfederal government) are not going to indict Mr. Epstein, but gave him an idea of the charges that\nwe had planned to bring as related to 18 USC 2255. With respect to question 2, do I have your\npermission to send Bert just that section of the plea agreement that applies to the damages claims\n(I would recommend sending paragraphs 7 through 10, or at least 7 and 8)? Can you talk with\nyour client about items 3 and 4? I envisioned Shook Hardy sending regular bills to you, with\nany privileged information redacted, and being paid like every other client pays the bills.\n\n1. Can we get a copy of the indictment (or can you tell me the nature of the crimes against the girls)?\n\n2. When will it be possible to see the plea agreement so that we understand exactly what Epstein\nconcedes to in the civil case?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012632",
