  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nDinner with President and Mrs. Ford\n\nSeveral years before Gerald Ford died, he and his wife invited me to deliver a lecture in Palm\nSprings where they were living. They invited my son and me to join them for dinner before the\nlecture. We schmoozed about our common experiences at Yale Law School, our different party\naffiliations, and our mutual love for football and other sports. Then he asked me a question:\n“What do you think of Justice John Paul Stevens?” I responded that I thought he was one of the\ngreatest justices in modern history, that he brought real common sense to the job of judging, that\nhe was non-ideological and that he was a really nice man. He deemed and said, “appointing him\nwas the second most important decision of my presidency.” I asked him what the first most\nimportant decision was. He said, “The one that cost me reelection—the pardon of President\nNixon.”\n\n380\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017467",
