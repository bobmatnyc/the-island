Burton Professor of the History of\nChristianity at the University of Chicago\nDivinity School. Clark studies the cultural\nhistory of theology in England and America\nfrom the seventeenth century to the present.\nFrom 1990 to 2000, he served as dean of the\nDivinity School, and from 2000 to 2004 he\ndirected the Martin Marty Center, the Divinity\nSchool’s institute for advanced research in all\nfields of the academic study of religion. His\ncurrent research projects include a book with the\nworking title Alone with the Alone: Solitude in\nAmerican Religious and Literary History, which\nexplores ways in which the spiritual discipline of\nsolitary writing—autobiographic narratives,\njournals, and letters—shaped the careers of\nmajor New England intellectuals of the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nAnthropomorphic representations of\nGod make many modern people very nervous,\nincluding many religious people. Attributing\nhuman-like ideas and emotions to the\ncomprehending powers of the universe not only\nseems out of step with modern science but also a\npresumptuous confinement of the world within\nmerely human needs and capacities. Yet, the\nimpulse to speak anthropomorphically about our\n“ultimate environment” has vigorously persisted\ninto the modern age. Rather than dismissing\nanthropomorphism as an outmoded way of\nthinking, this essay adopts a historical approach\nto rethink why anthropomorphism exhibits this\nperennial capacity to focus the human ethical\nimagination on our relations with and obligations\nto the universe within which we live.\n\nPage | 102\n\nthirties, mounted the narrow steps into\nthe pulpit on July 8, 1741, the sermon he\nwas about to preach would become one\nof the most famously electrifying\norations in American history, “Sinners in\nthe Hands of an Angry God.” Edwards\npreached this sermon during the massive\ntransatlantic religious revival that gave\nrise to Methodism in England and came\nto be known in the American colonies as\n“the Great Awakening.” This was not\nthe familiar pulpit of his congregation in\nNorthampton, Massachusetts, but rather\nthe church at Enfield, a town that had\ngained notoriety for stubbornly resisting\nthe exhortations of previous preachers of\nspiritual awakening. From his scriptural\ntext—“‘their foot shall slide in due time”\n(Deut. 32: 35)—Edwards drew the\ndoctrine that “there is nothing that keeps\nwicked men, at any one moment, out of\nhell, but the mere pleasure of God.”\nSinners living here and now, Edwards\ndeclared, were “the objects of that very\nsame anger and wrath of God, that is\nexpressed in the torments of hell,” and\nthat wrath was an annihilating fire that\nalready “burns against them; their\ndamnation does not slumber; the pit is\nprepared; the fire is made ready...to\nreceive them.” In a notorious image,\nEdwards portrayed God dangling the\nsinner’s soul over the fires of hell like a\nspider on a single, slender filament of its\nweb. The sermon achieved stunning\nresults, as recorded in the diary of one of\nthose present, Stephen Williams:\n\n“before the sermon was done, there was\na great moaning and crying out\nthroughout the whole house—what shall\nI do to be saved; oh, I am going to hell;\noh, what shall I do for a Christ.” The\n“shrieks and cries were piercing and\namazing,” Williams reported, and the\nscene was so tumultuous that Edwards _\nhad to stop before finishing his sermon.’\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021348",
