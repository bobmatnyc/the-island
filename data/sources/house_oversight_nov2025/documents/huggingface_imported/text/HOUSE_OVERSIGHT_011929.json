Conchita Sarnoff reports on the sordid details in part two of her\nexclusive exposé. Also:\n\n« Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the bathroom soap was\nshaped like sex organs\n\n* Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three massage\nappointments each day\n\n* The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than Epstein—for trying\nto sell notes regarding massage appointments\n\n* Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling\nagency MC2\n\n* According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2— often\nfrom Eastern Europe—then traveled on Epstein’s private jets\n\nJetfrey Epstein’s loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than\noutrageously lenient. They insist that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were\nmostly legal and essentially harmless. As the police records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo\nWay were routinely told they could “say no” at any time during a massage as Epstein escalated\ncontact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in every victim’s statement: First\nshe would be asked to remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt to fondle her buttocks\nand breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator. There was sometimes digital\npenetration, and the more willing girls were lured into full-blown sexual relations with both\nEpstein and Nadia Marcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts and police reports as\nEpstein’s live-in “sex slave.”\n\nA former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S.,\nconfirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein’s private jets.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011929",
