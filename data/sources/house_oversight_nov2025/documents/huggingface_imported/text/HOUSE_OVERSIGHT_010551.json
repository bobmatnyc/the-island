What was\nright in the first meeting, however, remained right irre-\nspective of defense tactics. Individuals have a constitu-\ntional right to a defense. The aggressive exercise of that\nright should not be punished, nor should a defense coun-\nsel’s exercise of their right to appeal a U.S Attorney to\nWashington D.C. Prosecutors must be careful not to allow\nfrustration and anger with defense counsel to influence\ntheir judgment.\n\nAfter the plea, I recall receiving several phone calls.\nOne was from the FBI Special Agent-In-Charge. He called\nto offer congratulations. He had been at many of the\nmeetings regarding this case. He was aware of the tactics\nof the defense, and he called to praise our prosecutors for\nholding firm against the likes of Messrs. Black, Dershow-\nitz, Lefkowitz and Starr. It was a proud moment. | also\nreceived calls or communications from Messrs. Dershow-\nitz, Lefkowitz and Starr. I had known all three individu-\nals previously, from my time in law school and at\nKirkland & Ellis in the mid 90s. They all sought to make\npeace. I agreed to talk and meet with each of them after\nEpstein pled guilty, as I think it important that prosecu-\ntors battle defense attorneys in a case and then move on. I\nhave tried, yet I confess that this has been difficult to do\nfully in this case.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire,\n\n7 Served time in jail and is now a registered sexual offender.\n_ He has been required to pay his victims restitution, though\n» festitution clearly cannot compensate for the crime.
