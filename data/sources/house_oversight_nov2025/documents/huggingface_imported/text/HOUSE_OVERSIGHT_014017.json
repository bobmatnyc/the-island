While working on that, my creativity slowly decreased until I hit\nrock bottom (a couple of times).\n\nWhile it is still difficult to survive in the music industry I find it not hard at all now to do what I want\nto do. And that’s all I do. I do what I want to do. It includes being a father, making music, composing,\ntaking care of business, traveling, learning languages (mostly Italian), riding my bike, etc.... It’s all in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n\n1. [I read the book step by step for about two months from September/October 2008 (plus surfing your\nblog) and just made tabula rosa with my life. (Lots of brainvomiting on paper.)\n\n2. I started outsourcing things that bothered me most (and therefore kept hanging out in my to-do list\nthe longest). I outsourced:\n\no » research, most of which is music-industry related (research\noutsourced saves about 2—3 hours/day)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014017",
