Rev. 844, *875\n\nThe mandatory prosecution duty, known as the \"legality principle,\" is itself a safeguard against selective underenforcement due\nto bias or favoritism. It is primarily an anti-discrimination injunction, intended to ensure that prosecutors treat like cases alike,\nrather than a mandate to ensure public safety and order through full enforcement. !°> Administrative and judicial enforceability\nof that duty is intended to ensure its effectiveness.\n\n2. Oversight of Declination Decisions in England and Wales\n\n106 and its largest criminal\n\nThe United Kingdom was an E.U. member state when the victim's right Directive was issued,\n[*876] justice system - the combined jurisdictions of England and Wales - provides several grounds on which victims or other\naggrieved parties may obtain both administrative and judicial review of non-prosecution decisions. Yet the reasons for this\nrelate foremost to public rather than private interests: \"a decision not to prosecute, especially in circumstances where it is\nbelieved or asserted that the decision is or may be erroneous, can affect public confidence in the integrity and competence of\n\nthe criminal justice system.\" 107\n\nIn line with other E.U. member states, English victims can seek administrative review within the Crown Prosecution Service.\nThe process appears to be meaningful; in recent years, between seven and thirteen percent of prosecution decisions challenged\nin this way have been reversed. !°8 Moreover, noncharging decisions are also subject to judicial review - a policy rarely seen\nin other common law jurisdictions. !°? The standard is deferential, but English courts do periodically overturn non-prosecution\ndecisions after evaluating them against written standards in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and other guidelines. !!° English\n\n111\n\ncourts have disapproved of decisions not to prosecute upon finding they were based on an unlawful policy or were found to\n\nbe [*877] \"perverse\" under a general reasonableness standard. !!? And in particular contrast to U.S. law with regard to lethal\nforce by police, English judges give special scrutiny to cases that arise from deaths in state custody, which by their nature raise\n\nthe specter of prosecutorial favoritism toward fellow law enforcement officials. !!3\n\nEmployers' Insolvency (1987); Comm. of Ministers, Council of Eur., Recommendation No. R (85) 11 of the Committee of Ministers to\nMembers States on the Position of the Victim in the Framework of Criminal Law and Procedure (1985). For analysis of Directive 2012/29 as\nwell as Council of Europe recommendations, see Buczma, supra note 61, at 242-48. In Germany, victims can initiate a private prosecution for\ncertain minor offenses, and for more serious offenses may take a formal role as accessory prosecutors with rights to participate in proceedings\nand to be heard before charges are dismissed. See Strafprozessordnung [StPO] [Code of Criminal Procedure], §§374-94, translation at\nhittps://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_ stpo/englisch_stpo.html (describing rights of privateklage); id. §§153, 395-402 (describing\nrights of nebenklager); see also id.§§403-406c (describing compensation); id. § 172 (describing victim's right to seek court order to compel\npublic prosecution); Michael Bohlander, Principles of German Criminal Procedure 25, 64 (2012).\n\n7% This describes, for example, the German system that allows private parties to act as accessory prosecutors alongside public prosecutors.\nSee Strafprozessordnung [StPO] [Code of Criminal Procedure],§§153, 395-402 (describing rights of nebenklager).\n\n4 See, e.g., Commonwealth Dir. of Pub. Prosecutions, supra note 71 (reporting three private prosecutions in federal courts in 2014-15).\n\n75 By the end of the nineteenth century, state and federal justice systems were firmly committed to the principle that prosecution is an\nexclusive power of public officials in which private victims have no role or standing. See Malley v. Lane, 115 A. 674, 676 (Conn. 1921); cf.\nLinda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973) (\"[A] citizen lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he\nhimself is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution... . In American jurisprudence at least, a private citizen lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.\").\n\n76 See Manikis, supra note 66.\n\n77 See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 5-7; Jack M. Kress, Progress and Prosecution, 423 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc. Sci. 99, 100 (1976); Allen\nSteinberg, From Private Prosecution to Plea Bargaining: Criminal Prosecution, the District Attorney, and American Legal History, 30 Crime\n& Deling. 568, 571-72 (1984) (finding that private prosecutions predominated in the colonies). In 1704, Connecticut established what was\nprobably the first public prosecutor's office. See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 17; Kress, supra, at 103. When Blackstone described criminal law\nas predominantly directed at public wrongs, he did so in the context of a late eighteenth century justice system in which private prosecutions\nwere common. See 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England: Book the Fourth 5-6 (1795).\n\n78 See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 23 (concluding that after 1789 “for the first half-century at least\" the public prosecutor was \"clearly a minor\nactor in the court's structure\" with a more judicial than executive role); Stephanie A.J. Dangel, Note, Is Prosecution a Core Executive\nFunction? Morrison v. Olson and the Framers' Intent, 99 Yale LJ. 1069, 1073 (1990) (\"First, colonial attorneys general and district attorneys\nperformed non-prosecutorial tasks ... .\" ); see also Steinberg, supra note 77, at 577 (noting public prosecutor's duties included responsibility\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016525",
