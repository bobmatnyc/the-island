Dersenieane PSsEx FaveeRa goes /EReEM Page 3 of 3\nThe FBI case revealed sexual allegations by at least 20 girls, however, Epstein struck a deal with\nprosecutors and served 13 months' jail for soliciting child prostitution.\n\nMs Roberts stayed working as Epstein's \"masseuse\" until she met an Australian martial arts\nexpert named Robert.\n\nThe pair married, causing an enraged Epstein to cut off the then 19-year-old.\n\nMs Roberts said she was coming to grips with her exploitation. Three years ago she was\ncontacted by the FBI who found photos and secret videos of her during their investigations.\n\nThe case forced Ms Roberts to deal with her abuse and also reveal it to her husband.\n\n\"I couldn't bring myself to tell him much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out,”\nshe told The Mail.\n\nWhile Epstein's plea deal meant her identity was hidden, Ms Roberts said after seeing a picture\nof the pair shopping she had to go public. \"I am appalled. To me, it's saying 'We are above the\nlaw'. But Jeffrey is a monster.\" Both Epstein and Prince Andrew refused to comment.\n\nOriginally published as Prince Andrew and the sex slave teen\n\nhttp:/Avww.dailytelegraph.com .au/the-prince-a-paedophile-and-the-sex-slave-teen/news-story/8cdeee961 a486febf459eafe00a7f710?sv=68c529bb044b9fdaSbf4f3... 2/2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014818",
