  "text": "124 Teaching Minds\n\nrepeated exposure and analysis. It always involves a lot of talking. And\ntherein lies the problem. Since appreciation and enjoyment are sub-\nconscious processes, it stands to reason that these processes are best\naddressed by a methodology that is less conscious. Telling me why I\nshould like something is not likely to do much more than teach me\nhow to talk about something as if I liked it. I can point out the finer\npoints of baseball to you, but if you don’t care, I won’t be able to get\nyou to go to the next baseball game.\n\nOn the other hand, of course, you certainly won’t like baseball if\nyou have never seen it played. Exposure is the key to teaching subcon-\nscious processes. Add to that an enjoyable atmosphere surrounding\nthe experience, especially if it is early on in one’s life, associated with\nthe artistry you want to teach, and it is likely that the learner will learn\nto like whatever he is being exposed to. So, evaluation, which starts\nout as a subconscious process, must be taught by enabling copying\nand repeated practice, but cannot easily be taught verbally.\n\nHOW TO TEACH DIAGNOSIS\n\nDiagnosis is the same and it is different. Many different people do di-\nagnosis under many different circumstances. But, the process is always\nthe same. So it seems normal to ask why an expert in doing diagno-\nsis in one area cannot do diagnosis nearly as well in another area of\nknowledge. Why can’t a doctor fix his own car? Why can’t a detective\nfigure out why a business is failing? It is all diagnosis after all.\n\nDiagnosis is best taught early on but it can be taught at any age.\nIn the end, it is just about knowing what counts as evidence and how\nto create and rule out hypotheses. The general process of gathering\nevidence and testing hypotheses is the same no matter what you are\ndoing. This is true in principle, of course, not in actual fact. In reality,\ndoctors cannot rule out hypotheses by tests that might harm the pa-\ntient. Businesspeople cannot rule out hypotheses by running control\nbusinesses that may lose money while others make money. Detectives\ncannot spoil a crime scene by altering the evidence. Mechanics cannot\ntry something that might make things worse. Investors cannot control\nworld events that might make a seemingly correct hypothesis still not\nwork out all that well.\n\nTo teach diagnosis, simple problems can be worked on that lead to\nmore complex problems. What is being taught, apart from the process\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023870",
