  "text": "What might look like a fun photo at first glance, showing two brothers, Michael and Sean McQuilken, is actually the last\npicture of them before being struck by lightning. The photo was taken at Moro Rock in California’s Sequoia National Park\non August 20, 1975. “At the time, we thought this was humorous. I took a photo of Mary (their sister) and Mary took a\nphoto of Sean and me. I raised my right hand into the air and the ring I had on began to buzz so loudly that everyone\ncould hear it. I found myself on the ground with the others. Sean was collapsed and huddled on his knees. Smoke was\n\npouring from his back,” recalled Michael. All of them survived but, sadly, Sean took his own life in 1989.\n\n#12 Moving An Apartment Building To Create A\n\nBoulevard In Alba Iulia, Romania\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020677",
