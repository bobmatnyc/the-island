  "text": "12/8/2015\n\nPrince Andrew and girl, 17, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Daily Mail Online\n\nFirst meeting: Prince Andrew puts his arms around 17-year-old Virginia, centre\n\nOn one of those occasions Virginia Roberts was subsequently paid $15,000 (£9,400). Her shocking\naccount of her four years as Epstein’s personal masseuse is supported by court documents, an\neyewitness, photographs and flight details of Epstein’s private jets.\n\nOne picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew’s first encounter with the girl in\nMarch 2001 and published today by The Mail on Sunday, shows the Prince with his arm around her\nwaist.\n\nThis is not the first time the Duke of York’s judgment and choice of associates have been\nquestioned. He appears to relish the company of super-rich oil billionaires from the Middle East,\nNorth Africa and the former Soviet Union.\n\nThe peculiar sale of his former marital home to a Kazakh businessman for £15 million after it had\nlanguished unsold for five years at £12 million has never been satisfactorily explained.\n\nIn the recent leak of American diplomatic cables it was revealed that he had criticised an official\ncorruption investigation into the huge Al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia,\nwhile he is also said to be close to Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the beleaguered Libyan president,\nand may have had a role in the early release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi.\n\nWhile on the streets, |\nslept with men for\nmoney. | was a\npaedophile's dream\n\nBut it is Andrew's friendship with Epstein, whom\nhe has known since at least 2000, and with\nEpstein’s confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter\nof the late disgraced newspaper baron Robert\nMaxwell, that gives most concern.\n\nHe was first seen with the pair on holiday in\nThailand, and was pictured cavorting with\nGhislaine at a Halloween fetishthemed party in\nManhattan.\n\nThe photograph that appeared last weekend shows the prince strolling through Central Park with\n58-year-old Epstein. Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in\nDecember, when he was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner.\n\nIt is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has attended as Epstein’s guest.\n\nA lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was\na guest at a cocktail party thrown by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models.\n‘Some guests were horrified,’ said the article’s author, Vicky Ward.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his\nsentence for offences relating to child prostitution.\n\nb announce they are\nexpecting a baby boy -\nafter trying to get\npregnant for more than\na year\n\n> Back together?
