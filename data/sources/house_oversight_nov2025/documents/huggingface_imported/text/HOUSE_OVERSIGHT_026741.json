  "text": "transition might have been almost inevitable given the ‘right’ environment. We just\ndon’t know -- nor do we know if the DNA/RNA chemistry of terrestrial life is the\nonly possibility, or just one chemical basis among many options that could be realized\nelsewhere\n\nLIFE\n\nMoreover, even if simple life is widespread, we can't assess the odds that it evolves\ninto a complex biosphere. And, even it did, it might anyway be unrecognizably\ndifferent.\n\nAnd, by the way, it’s too anthropocentric to limit attention to Earth-like planets.\nCarl Sagan and his Cornell colleague Ed Salpeter, envisaged balloon-like creatures\nfloating in the dense atmospheres of Jupiter-like planets. We should also be mindful\nthat seemingly artificial emissions could come from super-intelligent (though not\nnecessarily conscious) computers, created by a race of alien beings that had already\ndied out.\n\nIndeed I think that’s the most likely option if evolution took a similar course to\nwhat may happen on Earth.\n\nIf the emergence of technology ona planet lags significantly behind what has\nhappened on Earth then that planet would plainly reveal no evidence of ET. But life\naround a star older than the Sun could have had a head-start of a billion years or\nmore. Thus it may already have ‘spawned’ the futuristic scenario — trasitioning from\norganic to electronic -- that I envisaged as our Earth’s post-human future.\n\nSo even if SETI searches revealed some artificial emission, we’d be most unlikely to\n‘catch’ alien intelligence in the brief sliver of time when it was still in organic form.\nI think it’s less likely be a decodable message than to be a byproduct (or even a\nmalfunction) of some super-complex interstellar technology that could trace its\nlineage back to alien organic beings (which might still exist on their home planet, or\nmight long ago have died out).\n\nI won't hold my breath, but SETI programmes are a worthwhile gamble - because\nsuccess in the search would carry the momentous message that concepts of logic and\nphysics aren't limited to the hardware in human skulls.\n\nEven if intelligence were widespread in the cosmos, we may only ever\nrecognise asmall and atypical fraction of it. Moreover , the habit of referring to ET as\nan ‘alien civilisation’ may be too restrictive. A ‘civilisation’ connotes a society of\nindividuals: in contrast, ET might be a single integrated intelligence\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026741",
