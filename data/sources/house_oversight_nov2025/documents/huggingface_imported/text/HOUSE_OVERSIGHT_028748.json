  "text": "DP: In the long term, the United States could greatly benefit Islam by\nuniquely freeing the religion from government constraints and permitting\nit to evolve in a positive, modern direction. But that’s the long term. Right\nnow, American Muslims labor under Saudi and other influences, their\ninstitutions are extreme, and things are heading in a destructive direction.\nIt’s also distressing to see how non-Muslim individuals and institutions,\nparticularly those on the left, indulge Islamist misbehavior.\n\nTB: How do they do that?\n\nDP: Well, turn on the television, go to a class, follow the work of the\nACLU or the Southern Poverty Law Center, and you will see corporations,\nnonprofits, and government institutions working with the Islamists,\nhelping promote the Islamist agenda. The American left and the Islamists\nagree on what they dislike—conservatives—and, despite their profound\ndifferences, they cooperate.\n\nTB: Presumably some Muslims here deconvert, right?\n\nDP: There are some conversions out of Islam, yes. And the Muslim\nestablishment in this country 1s quite concerned about that. But\nnumerically it is not a significant number.\n\nTB: The ones who convert don’t talk about it very much?\n\nDP: In some cases they do; they take advantage of Western freedoms to\nspeak their minds. They are the exceptions, though.\n\nTB: I suspect that the decline of Christianity has encouraged Islam.\n\nDP: Very much so, as the contrast between Europe and the United States\nreveals. The hard kernel of American Christian faith, not present in\nEurope, means that Islamists are far better behaved in the United States.\nThey see the importance of a Christian counterforce.\n\nTB: Earlier, you mentioned Algeria. It is a big Muslim state that we\ndon’t hear about today.\n\nDP: Twenty years ago Algeria was a major focus of attention. That long\nago ended, although in France coverage is still significant. Algeria is ripe\nfor the same kind of upheaval that we have seen in other North African\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028748",
