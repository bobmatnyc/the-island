  "text": "14\n\nSITUATION ROOM\n\nust before seven o’clock on the morning of Tuesday, April 4, the seventy-fourth day of\nJ the Trump presidency, Syrian government forces attacked the rebel-held town of Khan\nSheikhoun with chemical weapons. Scores of children were killed. It was the first time a\nmajor outside event had intruded into the Trump presidency.\n\nMost presidencies are shaped by external crises. The presidency, in its most critical\nrole, is a reactive job. Much of the alarm about Donald Trump came from the widespread\nconviction that he could not be counted on to be cool or deliberate in the face of a storm.\nHe had been lucky so far: ten weeks in, and he had not been seriously tested. In part this\nmight have been because the crises generated from inside the White House had\novershadowed all outside contenders.\n\nEven a gruesome attack, even one on children in an already long war, might not yet be\na presidential game changer of the kind that everyone knew would surely come. Still,\nthese were chemical weapons launched by a repeat offender, Bashar al-Assad. In any other\npresidency, such an atrocity would command a considered and, ideally, skillful response.\nObama’s consideration had in fact been less than skillful in proclaiming the use of\nchemical weapons as a red line—and then allowing it to be crossed.\n\nAlmost nobody in the Trump administration was willing to predict how the president\nmight react—or even whether he would react. Did he think the chemical attack important\nor unimportant? No one could say.\n\nIf the Trump White House was as unsettling as any in American history, the president’s\nviews of foreign policy and the world at large were among its most random, uninformed,\nand seemingly capricious aspects. His advisers didn’t know whether he was an isolationist\nor a militarist, or whether he could distinguish between the two. He was enamored with\ngenerals and determined that people with military command experience take the lead in\nforeign policy, but he hated to be told what to do. He was against nation building, but he\nbelieved there were few situations that he couldn’t personally make better. He had little to\nno experience in foreign policy, but he had no respect for the experts, either.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020021",
