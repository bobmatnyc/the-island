Cabot Professor of American Literature \nNovember 25, 2018 \nDear Ms. Knowles-Carter, \nTel: \nFax: \nI am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest of Poetry in America \n(poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in America's first season's guests included Bill Clinton, \nJoe Biden, Cynthia Nixon, Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Samantha Power, Herbie \nHancock, John McCain, Nas, Angela Duckworth, Bono, Regina Spektor, Frank Gehry, \nStuart Weitzman, E.O. Wilson, and many others. Seasons Two and Three will feature just \nas distinguished a line up. The series airs on public television stations everywhere, \nstreams via Amazon Prime and other streaming services, and it is now also airing on a \nvariety of domestic and international airlines. \nThe poem we'd read and interpret together is by the contemporary poet Evie Shockley, \nand it's called \"you can say that again, billie.\" It's a brilliant and beautiful poem that \nspeaks back to Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" and evokes a whole history of gender and \nrace in the American South. You are the ideal reader for this poem. We would use what \nwe filmed together in an upcoming season of Poetry in America. We would also use the \ncontent in materials that we are creating for K-12 classrooms in partnership with Harvard. \nEverything we create would be educational and non-commercial. \nThank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work with you. \nSincerely, \nElisa New \nDirector and Host of Poetry in America \nPowell M. Cabot Professor, Harvard \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029298",
