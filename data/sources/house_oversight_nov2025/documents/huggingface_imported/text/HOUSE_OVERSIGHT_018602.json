Some monogamists felt that I was damning\nmonogamy with faint praise. Some polyamorists felt that it was problematic for me to\nwrite a post praising the culturally dominant Western mode of sexuality, because it's\nalready dominant. On the other hand, the piece was cross-posted at a number of high-\nprofile websites, and I got a lot of positive commentary too.\n\nMy favorite comments came from Pepper Mint, a polyamory advocate who commented\non this post when it was cross-posted at Feministe. J really felt like Pepper got what I\nwas trying to do. Here's an excerpt from one of his comments:\n\n\"Monogamy is [perceived as] a hegemonic requirement, not an option that should be\nadvocated. So when people espouse monogamy (which is rare, since it is hegemonic),\nthey do it by claiming that anything else is impossible or they do it by making moral\nstatements. I challenge you to find a mainstream article that actually lists out the\npragmatic benefits of monogamy, like Clarisse has done here. I don't think I've ever seen\none. Indeed, when monogamy is explicitly discussed in the mainstream currently, it often\nseems to be in ‘is monogamy realistic ?' articles.\n\n\"Note that this is all to the detriment of monogamous people as well as nonmonogamous\npeople. When I talk to people about polyamory, I get a lot of defensive responses, for the\nsimple reason that monogamous people are often monogamous because they did not\nknow there was a choice, rather than monogamous by inclination or what have you.\nDiscourse that presents monogamy as an actual choice and lists out the pros and cons of\nthat choice is nonmonogamy-affirming in my book, unless it is hugely one-sided.\n\n\"We have a problem in the poly communities I engage in, where people new to\npolyamory spend a couple years unfairly trashing monogamy. This is partly out of anger\nfrom their history and partly because they've finally found what they are looking for and\neverything else looks shabby in comparison. But it creates ill-will where none need exist,\nit screws up people's approach to relationships, and it bites people later if they want to\ngo back to monogamy.\n\n\"So as a polyamory activist I'm very glad this essay was written, and I've posted similar\nthings myself in various forums. It addresses a hole in the discourse that is very\nimportant to fill.”\n\nThanks, Pepper.\nTK OK ok\nIn Praise of Monogamy\nThere are lots of different ways of approaching non-monogamous relationships, such as:\n\n+ Polyamory: Usually emphasizes developing full-on romantic relationships with more\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018602",
