  "text": "Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 306 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/02/2015 Page 15 of 19\n\nNext, Jane Doe #3 claims that Prof. Dershowitz declined to defend his reputation in the\nEdwards v. Epstein lawsuit (Case no. 502009-CA-040800) in Palm Beach County Circuit Court.\n(Opp. to Mtn. to Intervene at 13.) In support of this allegation, Jane Doe #3 argues that her\nattorney in the instant matter, Bradley Edwards (through his attorney Jack Scarola) contacted\nProf. Dershowitz to seek his voluntary cooperation in answering questions about Prof.\nDershowitz’s client, Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct.

Instead, Edwards was incorrectly\nseeking Prof. Dershowitz’s cooperation for a civil suit between Dershowitz’s client, Jeffrey\n\nEpstein, and Edwards himself.
