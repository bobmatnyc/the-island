  "text": "Epilogue | 301\n\nissue is not surveillance itself; it is the proper way such surveillance\nis conducted.\n\nThe NSA surveillance of telephone records that Snowden exposed\nwas different in its intent from the surveillance of the Cold War. Its\ntarget was a selected list of 300 to 400 foreign jihadists living abroad.\nMany of these individuals residing in Syria, Iraq, and Pakistan had\nbeen identified by the FBI and the CIA as active bomb makers, assas-\nsins, and weapon specialists. This was not domestic surveillance, but\nwhen any of these suspects telephoned a phone number in the United\nStates, the NSA checked the billing records of the domestic phone\nnumber that had been called to determine all the calls emanating\nfrom it. The purpose of this search was to assemble for the FBI a list\nof contacts that a foreign suspect might have in the United States. To\nexpedite this task, it obtained from telephone companies the billing\nrecords, without any names attached, of all their users and stored\nthem in a single archive under its control. While this surveillance\ntargeted foreign terrorists, not domestic dissent, the bulk collection\nof phone records had the potential for more nefarious use, a danger\n\n© that Snowden brought to the public’s attention. As a result, Con- ©\ngress modified the Patriot Act so that billing records would remain\non the computers of the phone companies for a limited time rather\nthan on those of the NSA. The NSA could still search them after\nobtaining an order from the FISA court, though it could not archive\nthe data for future use, so little harm to individual privacy could be\ndone. Snowden deserves a large share of the credit not only for this\nchange but for making the public aware of domestic surveillance.\n\nThe bad part of the equation is that Snowden deeply damaged an\nintelligence system that American presidents have relied on for over\nsix decades. The heart of that system was the sources and methods\nused to intercept other nations’ communications. Until Snowden, the\nNSA’s wall of secrecy kept these nations from knowing about them\nor, in some cases, even realizing that they were vulnerable to inter-\nception. For example, as previously discussed, the NSA had developed\nthe remarkable ability to tap into an adversary nation’s computers,\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 301 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019789",
