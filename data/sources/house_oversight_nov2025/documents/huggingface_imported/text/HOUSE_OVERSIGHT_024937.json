  "text": "February 1968, when they met and issued a historical statement announcing the establishment of a federal\nunion between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and called on their brothers in the neighboring emirates to join the union.\nDo you know what it meant for us to stand few days ago with His Highness Sheikh Khalifa at the “Union\nHouse” under the UAE flag, and in the same place where our ancestors stood the day of the UAE\nannouncement? Would you be able to appraise our feelings at that moment? These are moments that you cannot\nponder easily. They are priceless.\n\nThose who know the truth about the Abu Dhabi and Dubai relationship and all the other Emirates, are well\naware that the federation of the UAE is a choice of wise and liberated people who are guided by their heart,\nbeliefs and wisdom. They are people who God Almighty described as ready to sacrifice their souls for others.\nAgain, I remind you of what His Highness Sheikh Khalifa said. “We are ... one strong, coherent body.\n\nThe National Abu Dhabi Media Company - Matt Slater\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is a federation but there is a tendency, particularly in health\nand education, to allow individual emirates to dictate policy. Will this continue or will\nthe federal government seek to establish a more unified national approach on domestic\npolicy?\n\nNone of the seven emirates develops its own independent health and educational policies. All legislation and\npolicies related to education and overall health are developed at the federal level. What is happening is precisely\nthe expansion of the decentralized planning and implementation in order to raise the efficiency of education and\nmedical services. This is what we see in industrialized countries, such as the United States and the United\nKingdom, Germany, Switzerland and others. Our experience in education foundered for many reasons, and we\nare racing against time to make up for what we missed and to create sustainable development in the education\nsector. Of course, the process of development widens then to diversify the teaching methods and to attract\nbroad participation of the private sector.\n\nThe National Abu Dhabi Media Company - Matt Slater\n\nThe Federal National Council has expressed concern that its views are ignored by the\nUAE cabinet and that, in reality, they have little power. What role do you see the FNC\nplaying within the country’s decision-making p rocess, and in what way is the Council\nlikely to evolve in the future?\n\nWe never received any complaints against the government for ignoring the views of the Council; instead we\nalways receive compliments and appreciation about cooperation. We constantly express our appreciation to the\nCouncil for its role in the decision-making process. In fact, draft laws first have to pass through the FNC for\nreview and recommendations, and later sent back to the Cabinet for consideration and approval.\n\nThe Council is also empowered to summon and to question any Federal Minister regarding Ministry\nperformance. We believe in the importance of the Council, and we respect its effective role in the process since\nits inception. The current session marked a beginning of change in the Council in the method of selecting its\nmembers. We witnessed for the first time the formation of election associations in the UAE to elect half the\nmembers of the 40-member Council, with 22 percent of members of the Council being women, one of the\nhighest such rates in the world.\n\nIn any case, since the founding of the UAE we chose the approach of gradualism. We in the UAE do not work\n\nwith a “burning stages” style. Our laws and procedures are in line with reality and our reticence. We believe\nthat our people are satisfied with this approach that results in prosperity and stability.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024937",
