  "text": "1.5 Extraordinary Proof? 5\n\nserve as proofs of CogPrime’s power for advanced AGI. We have used some CogPrime ideas in\nthe OpenCog framework to do things like natural language understanding and data mining, and\nto control virtual dogs in online virtual worlds; and this has been very useful work in multiple\nsenses. It has taught us more about the CogPrime design; it has produced some useful software\nsystems; and it constitutes fractional work building toward a full OpenCog based implemen-\ntation of CogPrime. However, to date, the things OpenCogPrime has done are all things that\ncould have been done in different ways without the CogPrime architecture (though perhaps not\nas elegantly nor with as much room for interesting expansion).\n\nThe bottom line is that building an AGT is a big job. Software companies like Microsoft spend\ndozens to hundreds of man-years building software products like word processors and operating\nsystems, so it should be no surprise that creating a digital intelligence is also a relatively large-\nscale software engineering project. As time advances and software tools improve, the number of\nman-hours required to develop advanced AGI gradually decreases — but right now, as we write\nthese words, it’s still a rather big job. In the OpenCogPrime project we are making a serious\nattempt to create a CogPrime based AGI using an open-source development methodology,\nwith the open-source Linux operating system as one of our inspirations. But the open-source\nmethodology doesn’t work magic either, and it remains a large project, currently at an early\nstage. I emphasize this point so that readers lacking software engineering expertise don’t take\nthe currently fairly limited capabilities of OpenCogPrime as somehow a damning indictment of\nthe potential of the CogPrime design. The design is one thing, the implementation another —\nand the OpenCogPrime implementation currently encompasses perhaps one third to one half\nof the key ideas in this book.\n\nSo we don’t have extraordinary proof to offer. What we aim to offer instead are clearly-\nconstructed conceptual and technical arguments as to why we think the CogPrime design has\ndramatic AGI potential.\n\nIt is also possible to push back a bit on the common intuition that having a design for human-\nlevel AGI is such an “extraordinary claim.” It may be extraordinary relative to contemporary\nscience and culture, but we have a strong feeling that the AGI problem is not difficult in the\nsame ways that most people (including most AI researchers) think it is. We suspect that in\nhindsight, after human-level AGI has been achieved, people will look back in shock that it took\nhumanity so long to come up with a workable AGI design. As you'll understand once you’ve\nfinished Part 1 of the book, we don’t think general intelligence is nearly as “extraordinary”\nand mysterious as it’s commonly made out to be. Yes, building a thinking machine is hard —\nbut humanity has done a lot of other hard things before. It may seem difficult to believe that\nhuman-level general intelligence could be achieved by something as simple as a collection of\nalgorithms linked together in an appropriate way and used to control an agent. But we suggest\nthat, once the first powerful AGI systems are produced, it will become apparent that engineering\nhuman-level minds is not so profoundly different from engineering other complex systems.\n\nAll in all, we’ll consider the book successful if a significant percentage of open-minded,\nappropriately-educated readers come away from it scratching their chins and pondering: “Hmm.\nYou know, that just might work.” and a small percentage come away thinking \"Now that’s an\ninitiative I'd really like to help with!\".\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012921",
