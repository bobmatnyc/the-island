  "text": "Many evolutionary scientists, and such philosophers as Daniel Dennett, have\npointed out that the human brain is the result of billions of years of evolution.*°> Human\nintelligence is not the special characteristic we think it is, but just another survival\nmechanism not unlike our digestive or immune systems, both of which are also\namazingly complex. Intelligence evolved because it allowed us to make sense of the\nworld around us, to plan ahead, and thus cope with all sorts of unexpected things in order\nto survive. However, as Descartes stated, we humans define our very existence by our\nability to think. So it is not surprising that, in an anthropomorphic way, our fears about\nAI reflect this belief that our intelligence is what makes us special.\n\nBut if we step back and look at life on Earth, we see that we are far from the most\nresilient species. If we’re going to be taken over at some point, it will be by some of\nEarth’s oldest life-forms, like bacteria, which can live anywhere from Antarctica to deep-\nsea thermal vents hotter than boiling water, or in acid environments that would melt you\nand me. So when people ask where we’re headed, we need to put the question in a\nbroader context. I don’t know what sort of future AI will bring: whether AI will make\nhumans subservient or obsolete or will be a useful and welcome enhancement of our\nabilities which will enrich our lives. But I am reasonably certain that computers will\nnever be the overlords of bacteria.\n\n35 See, for example, Dennett’s From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds (New York: W.\nW. Norton, 2017).\n\n133\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016936",
