MAPS\n[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]--their publication\nwas sent back several times because maps are not allowed in here. High\nTimes was repeatedly denied because it posed a danger to the safe, secure\nand orderly operation of the institution. ‘Smut mags’ like Hust/er are\nreviewed monthly.”\n\n* “There’ s a whole new genre of men’ s magazines--Maxim, Stuff,\nFor Him--which show it all except for nipples and beaver. Now the feds\nwant to ban Maxim due to ‘security’ reasons. The ‘rejected mail’ slip\nthey send you when some verboten material arrives has boxes to check (to\nspecify offending matter), one of which says ‘pubic hair.’ ”\n\n* “Peace activist William Combs spent eight days in_ solitary\nconfinement for receiving and sharing with other inmates what federal\nauthorities consider disruptive, if not subversive, political literature. The\noffending ‘propaganda’ included commentary by such extremists as Bill\nMoyers and Ellen Goodman, and included an article published in\nReader’ s Digest. The common thread was that they all questioned the\n\nwisdom of government policy.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015289",
