Epstein paid Wild, and many other underage girls, to give him massages, often having\nthem undress and perform sexual acts. Epstein also used the girls as recruiters, paying them\nto bring him other underage girls. Epstein, 65, a hedge fund manager, splits his time between the\n\nVirgin Islands and Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nVIRGIN ISLANDS\n\nSaturday, December 8, 2018\n\n6 by MIAMI HERALD\n\nJena-Lisa Jones, with her 18-month-old son, Raymond, says she was 14 when she was intro-\nduced to Jeffrey Epstein and was paid $200 by him to give him a massage at his home. Jones\n\nsays Epstein told her to take off all of her clothes and that he fondled her during the massage.\n\nLawmakers issue call for investigation of Epstein deal\n\nBy JULIE K. BROWN,\nALEX DAUGHERTY\nand CAITLIN OSTROFF\nMiami Herald\n\nMIAMI More than two dozen\nlawmakers are demanding an inves-\nligation into possible misconduct\nby US. Secretary of Labor Alexan-\nder Acosta, who, as a former federal\nprosecutor in Miami, helped broker a\nsecret plea deal for a multimillionaire\naccused of running an underage sex\ntrafficking network.\n\nThe lawmakers, mostly Democrats,\n\nhave sent several letters to Michael E.\nHorowitz, inspector general for the\nDepartment of Justice, calling for a\nprobe into Acosta’ role in the 2008\nplea deal for Little St. James resident\nJeffrey Epstein.\nEpstein, 65, a hedge fund manager\nwho splits his time between the Virgin\nIslands and Palm Beach, Fla., faced\na possible life sentence for molest-\ning dozens of girls, but was instead\ngranted federal immunity as part of a\nnon-prosecution agreement approved\nby Acosta when he was U.S. Attorney\nforthe Southern Distnet of Florida.\n\nThus far, 34 senators and members\nof the House have called for a probe\nof the Epstein case, including two Re-\npublicans, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen,\nchairman of the Senate Ju-\nommittee’s subcommittee for\noversight\n\nThe requests come one week after\nthe Miami Herald published an i\nvestigation, “Perversion of Justic\nthat revealed hea federal prosecutors\nworked with Epsteins high-profile\nlawyers to craft a deal that would keep\n\nhim out of prison. Instead he would\nserve a bnef jail stint.\n\nAcosta agreed, despite a federal law\nto the contrary, that the deal would\nbe kept from Epstein’ underage vic-\ntims unul after Epstein was sentenced,\nthereby making it impossible for them\nto appear in court and possibly derail\nthe agreement.\n\nThe Herald identified nearly 80\npossible victims, most of them 13 to\n16 years old. Several of them, now in\nthei late 20s and early 30s, told the\nHerald that they felt betrayed by Acos-\nta and other prosecutors who failed to\ntreat them as victims and labeled them\nas prostitutes — even though they\nwere under the age of consent.\n\nAcosta, 49, was confirmed as Presi-\ndent Donald Trump's labor secretary\nin April 2017. During his hearings,\nSens. Tim Kaine and Patty Murray\nquestioned Acosta about Epstein’s\ndeal but Acosta never explained why\nhe agreed to have it sealed.\n\nHe was approved by the Senate,\n60-38, with eight Democrats and one\nindependent voting in favor of his\nappointment.\n\n“At the end of the day, based on the\n\nevidence, professionals within a pros-\necutor's office decided that a plea that\nguarantees someone goes to jail, that\nguarantees he register (as a sex of-\nfender) generally and guarantees other\noutcomes, is a good thing,” Acosta\nsaid during his hearings.\nf , Acosta over-\nssive federal agency that pro-\nsight of the country’s labor\n, including human trafficking.\n\nHe had been on a list of possible\nsuccessors to former Attorney Gen-\n\nThe Miami Herald identified nearly 80 possible victims,\nmost of them 13 to 16 years old. Several of them, now\nin their late 20s and early 30s, told the Herald that they\nfelt betrayed by former federal prosecutor Alexander\nAcosta — who now works for the Trump administration\n— and other prosecutors who failed to treat them as\nvictims and labeled them as prostitutes — even though\nthey were under the age of consent.\n\neral Jeff Sessions, but was said to have\nbeen eliminated from consideration\nafter the Herald published its series\nonline last week.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of senators,\nled by Murray, the ranking Democrat\non the Senate panel that oversees the\nDepartment of Labor, wrote a letter\nto Horowitz, questioning whether Ep-\nstein used his connections to not only\nsecure a lenient sentence, but to obtain\nimmunity for other people who were\ninvolved or knew about his sexual ex-\nploitation of minors.\n\n“Our justice system is predicated\non the fundamental value that no in-\ndividual is above the law, and to that\nend, it is essential that plea agreements\ninvolving well-connected individuals\nnot only follow the law and standard\npractice, but also stand up to scm-\ntiny,” said the letter, signed by 15 other\nmembers of the Senate,\n\nRubio on Thursday also called upon\nthe Justice Department to explain how\nsuch a deal could have happened.\n\n“There should be a little bit more\nclanty as to why that case was re:\nsolved the way it was resolved,\" Rubio\n\nsaid “Because for most people that\nread it, it doesn’t make sense.”\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006, Epstein as-\nsembled a large cultlike network of\nunderage girls — most of them from\ndisadvantaged backgrounds —to give\nhim massages. He then coerced them\ninto sex acts and paid them to recruit\nother girls to bring to his Palm Beach\nmansion, three to four times a day, ac\ncording to police.\n\nThe Herald's examination of thou-\nsands of court records, emails and FBI\nrecords also showed that after the deal\nwas struck, it effectively shut down an\nongoing FBI probe into whether Ep-\nstein was trafficking girls and young\nwomen from around the country and\nfrom overseas for sex parties attended\nby other powerful people at his man-\nsions in New York, New Mexico and\non his private island in the Caribbean,\n\nFederal prosecutors had prepared a\n§3-page indictment against Epstem for\nfederal sex crimes involving minors,\nwhich would have sent him to prison\nfor decades. The indictment, however,\nwas shelved, and Epstein was allowed\nto plead guilty to two minor prostitu-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022463\n\ntion charges in state court.\n\nHe spent just 13 months inthe Palm\nBeach County jail, where he was giv-\nen permission to leave most of the day\nunder a liberal work release program\nthat wasn't granted to other convicted\nsex offenders. He was released in\n2009.\n\nSasse, in his letter, said he was dis-\nturbed that federal prosecutors would\nhave given Epstein such a break.\n\n“The fact that this monster received\nsuch a pathetically soft sentence is a\ntravesty that should outrage us all,”\nSasse wrote in a letter to DOJ's inspec-\ntor general.\n\nExperts say its possible that several\ninvestigations could be launched, not\njust by the Department of Justice.\n\nThe Deparment of Labor’ nspee-\ntor general could also do a review, said\nPhilip Lacovara, who served as coun-\ns¢l to the special prosecutor who in-\nvestigated President Richard Nixon's\nWatergate scandal.\n\nNeither agency is required to say\nif and when it is conducting a review,\nhe said, so its possible investigations\ncould already be underway: But the re-\nsults may or may not be made public.\n\n“They may do 10 confidential in-\nvestigations, but you may only know\nabout one,” Lacovara said,\n\nFrancey Hakes, a former federal\nprosecutor, said that such an investiga-\ntion could result in policy changes and\nnew regulations on how federal pros-\necutors handle victim notification and\nnon-prosecution agreements,\n\n“T just don’t know of any retrospec-\ntive way to fix things,” Hakes said. “I\nhope they will get to the bottom of\nwhatever happened.”",
