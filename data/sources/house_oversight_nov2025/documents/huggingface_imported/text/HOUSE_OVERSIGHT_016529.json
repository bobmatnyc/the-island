Finally, another institution responds to some of the same underenforcement\nproblems that private prosecution and judicial review could address - redundant prosecution authority in a federal system.\n\nC. Federalism Safeguards on Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nThe scope of the U.S. federal crimmal code expanded vastly in the twentieth century, as did the federal government's\ninstitutional capacity to enforce that code and its regulatory authority more generally. The result has been a distinctive form of\ncriminal justice federalism: federal enforcement authority wholly overlaps the territorial scope of state criminal law, and the\nfederal code substantially overlaps much of what is covered in state criminal codes. The resulting structure of redundant\nfederal-state authority has evolved into a means - unusual even among federal nation-states - to second-guess and effectively\ntrump state prosecutors’ declination decisions without empowering courts or private parties.\n\nNo other nation built on a federal model incorporates nearly [*885] the same degree of redundancy between state and federal\njustice systems. !3! The more common model of criminal justice federalism is found in Canada and Germany: each has a\nsingle national criminal code that is administered by separate state-level prosecution agencies and court systems. !3? Other\nfederal states follow the U.S. model and have separate criminal codes, prosecution agencies, and court systems in each state as\nwell as for the federal government. Australia follows this model, but the scope and jurisdiction of Australian federal criminal\nlaw is much more limited than is U.S. federal law; federal crimes are largely confined to offenses that implicate distinct federal\ninterests - it is probably closer to U.S. federal criminal law in 1910 than 2010. The result is that in Australia federal criminal\nlaw enforcement overlaps much less with state criminal law. !73\n\nThe broad redundancy provided by U.S. federalism enables federal prosecutors to serve as checks on underenforcement by\nstate prosecutors, at least for some large and important categories [*886] of crime. In effect, federal prosecutors can review\nthe declination decisions of state prosecutors - as well as the adequacy and success of their prosecutions - and then decide\nwhether to file federal charges in cases that their state counterparts declined to pursue, charged too leniently, or in which they\nfailed to win a conviction or sufficiently harsh sanctions. (In theory state prosecutors conduct the same oversight over much of\n\n°° See George Fisher, The Jury's Rise as Lie Detector, 107 Yale L.J. 575, 671-96 (1997) (discussing the impact of racial policies in post-Civil\nWar jury and court processes).\n\n%6 Tam aware of no historical research on African American private prosecutors, and I have found no evidence of any in case law or general\naccounts of private prosecutions.\n\n%7 See, e.g., Fisher, supra note 95, at 684 n.514 (\"Denial to the freedman of the power to testify in court against the white man ... strikes not\nat a mere civil franchise, but at a natural right - the right of protecting life and property. When a white man may take a freedman's life or\nproperty with impunity, if no other white men be present, the freedman has no security for either.\" (quoting The Progress of Reconstruction,\nN.Y. Times, Oct. 3, 1865, at 4)).\n\n°8 When Southern states were compelled to grant African American citizens litigation rights, they imposed strict conditions, permitting\nAfrican Americans the right to testify only when the crime victim (or the opposing civil litigant) was African American. Id. at 684. Those\nlimitations likewise restricted African Americans’ private prosecution authority, although in many places racial customs, backed by the\nprospect of racial violence, was probably discouragement enough.

Blackmon, Slavery by Another Name: The Re-\nEnslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War IT (2008) (discussing history of African Americans' distrust of America's\nJudicial system); Nicholas Lemann, Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War (2007) (exploring incidents after the Civil War and the\nimpact on politics during the Reconstruction Era).\n\n°° Michael J.
