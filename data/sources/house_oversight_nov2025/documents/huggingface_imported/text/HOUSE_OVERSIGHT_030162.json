  "text": "online. The result is that an old guard now confronts a new wave, and\nthe two sides think entirely differently and speak at cross-purposes.\nWhatever the new wave’s limitations, its borderless online\nconversations are offsetting the region’s political, religious, social,\nand cultural balkanization. The people of West Asia and North Africa\nare talking among themselves, even if their governments remain\nremote. That is a source of hope, if not yet of the systematic and\ncoherent ideas about how to remake their societies that the region\nneeds.\n\nCyber-activism has its limits; it cannot, in the end, deliver either\ndemocracy or prosperity. Communication may be instant, but, with\nno coherent animating ideology, the revolution proceeds in slow\nmotion. The battle being fought for the soul of the Middle East\ncannot be won online, nor can it be subdued through the cynical\nmanipulation of trust and fear. The quality of freedom in the Middle\nEast, as elsewhere, will depend on its supporters’ commitment to\nliberal and democratic values.\n\nHRH Prince El Hassan bin Talal is chairman and founder of the\nArab Thought Forum and the West Asia-North Africa Forum.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030162",
