No self yet.\nFig. 11.1: Piagetan Stages of Cognitive Development\n\nMore explicitly, Piaget defined his stages in psychological terms roughly as follows:\n\ne Infantile: In this stage a mind develops basic world-exploration driven by instinctive ac-\ntions. Reward-driven reinforcement of actions learned by imitation, simple associations be-\ntween words and objects, actions and images, and the basic notions of time, space, and\ncausality are developed. The most simple, practical ideas and strategies for action are\nlearned.\n\ne Preoperational: At this stage we see the formation of mental representations, mostly\npoorly organized and un-abstracted, building mainly on intuitive rather than logical think-\ning. Word-object and image-object associations become systematic rather than occasional.\nSimple syntax is mastered, including an understanding of subject-argument relationships.\nOne of the crucial learning achievements here is “object permanence” — infants learn that\nobjects persist even when not observed. However, a number of cognitive failings persist with\nrespect to reasoning about logical operations, and abstracting the effects of intuitive actions\nto an abstract theory of operations.\n\ne Concrete: More abstract logical thought is applied to the physical world at this stage.\nAmong the feats achieved here are: reversibility — the ability to undo steps already done;\nconservation — understanding that properties can persist in spite of appearances; theory of\nmind — an understanding of the distinction between what I know and what others know (If\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013106",
