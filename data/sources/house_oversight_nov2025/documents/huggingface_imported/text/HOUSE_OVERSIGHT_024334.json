Individual salaries\nare determined based upon a combination of factors, including the scope of responsibilities, individual performance and experience, our company’s\nperformance, an individual’s potential for making contributions to future company performance, and competitive pay practices. The committee considers all\nthese factors in determining base salary increases and does not assign a specific weighting to any individual factor.\n\nIn February 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee reviewed the base salaries of our executive officers, including our named\nexecutive officers, taking into consideration the factors described above. Following this review, the committee determined to maintain the base salary of our\nCEO at its 2017 level and to increase the base salaries of the other four named executive officers to maintain the competitiveness of this compensation\nelement. All of the NEOs’ 2018 base salaries were approximately at or below the market median as determined by the compensation consultant.\n\nErnest Garcia III, our chief executive officer, had a base salary of $400,000 for both 2017 and 2018, with no increase. Mark Jenkins, our chief\nfinancial officer, had a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Benjamin Huston, our chief operating officer,\nhad a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Ryan Keeton, our chief brand officer, had a 2017 base salary\nof $315,000 and a 2018 base salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%. Daniel Gill, our chief product officer, had a 2017 base salary of $315,000 and a 2018\nbase salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%.\n\n2018 ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN\n\nOur annual incentive plan was designed to align our executive officers’ incentives with our company goals and, therefore, to be aligned with the\ninterests of our shareholders. The Compensation and Nominating Committee approves which executives are eligible to participate (other than the CEO) and\nthe level of potential awards, identifies appropriate performance measures, and determines the financial targets of each measure. The CEO makes\nrecommendations as to these matters, but the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes all decisions with respect to the implementation of the\nannual incentive plan. For the CEO’s annual incentive plan, the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes a recommendation, with the Board\nmaking the final decision. In establishing performance goals, the committee and the Board as a whole review industry and market conditions, alignment of\nthe goals with our strategy, projected general economic conditions, and both our past and forecasted performance levels.\n\nTarget Bonuses and Payout Ranges\n\nFor the 2018 annual incentive plan, the committee established a target bonus at 66.7% of base salary for each of the NEOs, with a payout range\nof 0%—133% of base salary. Utilizing the same bonus target for all the NEOs promotes a culture of teamwork among the senior executives and encourages\ntheir entrepreneurial spirit. As a result, the CEO’s target 2018 total cash, including both base salary and target annual incentive plan amount, is below the\nmarket 25 th percentile of our compensation peer group.\n\n-26-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024334",
