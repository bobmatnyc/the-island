  "text": "806\n\nWL 2997881, at *22 (citing First Capital\nAsset Mgmt. v. Brickellbush, Inc. 218\nF.Supp.2d 369, 395 (S.D.N.Y.2002)). As\nwill be highlighted below, the complaints\ndo not allege any specific facts from which\nthe Court could infer that Prince Sultan,\nPrince Turki, Mohammed Abdullah Aljo-\nmaih, Sheikh Hamad Al-Husani, or Abdul-\nrahman bin Mahfouz directed, controlled,\nor requested al Qaeda to undertake its\nterrorist activities. Nor are there any\nspecific allegations of their knowledge of,\nor consent to those activities. See Daven-\ntree, 349 F.Supp.2d 736 at 762-63, 2004\nWL 2997881, at *22 (finding no personal\njurisdiction under a conspiracy theory be-\ncause there was no basis from which the\ncourt could impute to defendants the con-\nduct of their putative co-conspirators);\nChrysler Capital Corp, T78 F.Supp. at\n1266 (requiring specific facts warranting\nthe inference that the defendant was a\nmember of the conspiracy). Accordingly,\nfor Prince Sultan, Prince Turki, Mo-\nhammed Abdullah Aljomaih, Sheik Hamad\nAl-Husani, and Abdulrahman bin Mah-\nfouz, personal jurisdiction cannot be based\non a New York long-arm conspiracy theo-\nry. The Court will examine the possibility\nof exercising conspiracy theory personal\njurisdiction over the remaining moving De-\nfendants when it examines the specific\nclaims against each of them below.\n\n32. Although the Court does not have subject\nmatter jurisdiction over any of the moving\nDefendants pursuant to the FSIA, that statute\nalso provides for personal jurisdiction if ser-\nvice is proper and subject matter jurisdiction\nhas been established. 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b)\n(“[P]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign defen-\ndant shall exist as to every claim for relief of\nwhich the district courts have jurisdiction ...\nwhere service has been made under section\n1608 of this title.’”’); Rein v. Socialist People’s\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, 995 F.Supp. 325,\n329-330 (E.D.N.Y.1998).\n\n33. The Federal Plaintiffs pursue claims under\nRICO, which some courts outside the Second\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\n2. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n4(k)\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n4(k))(D), service of process will establish\npersonal jurisdiction over a defendant\nwhen so authorized by a federal statute.”\nHere, the ATA contains a nationwide ser-\nvice of process provision, such that proper\nservice will confer personal jurisdiction.”\n18 U.S.C. § 2334(a) (providing for nation-\nwide service of process and venue); Bur-\nnett [, 274 F.Supp.2d at 95-96. Courts\nasked to analyze personal jurisdiction un-\nder the ATA’s national service of process\nprovision have concluded that a plaintiff\n“must demonstrate that the defendant has\nsufficient minimum contacts to satisfy a\ntraditional due process analysis.” Estates\nof Ungar v. Palestinan Auth, 153\nF.Supp.2d 76, 95 (D.R.1.2001); see also\nBiton v. Palestinian Interim Self-Gov't\nAuth. 310 F.Supp.2d 172, 179 (D.D.C.\n2004) (dismissing complaint pursuant to 18\nU.S.C. § 2333 because individual defen-\ndants lacked contacts with the United\nStates). “The relevant inquiry under such\ncircumstances is whether the defendant\nhas minimum contacts with the United\nStates as a whole [to satisfy Fifth Amend-\nment due process requirements], rather\nthan ... with the particular state in which\nthe federal court sits.” Ungar, 153\nF.Supp.2d at 87. Many of the moving\n\nCircuit have held also provides for nationwide\nservice of process and jurisdiction. See 18\nU.S.C. § 1965; Republic of Panama v. BCCI\nHoldings (Luxembourg) S.A., 119 F.3d 935,\n942 (11th Cir.1997) (finding 18 U.S.C.\n8 1965(d) provides for nationwide jurisdic-\ntion); cf. PT United Can Co. Ltd. v. Crown\nCork & Seal Co., Inc., 138 F.3d 65, 71 (2d\nCir.1998) (finding “ 8 1965 does not provide\nfor nationwide personal jurisdiction over ev-\nery defendant in every civil RICO case, no\nmatter where the defendant is found’). The\nFederal Plaintiffs do not use their RICO\nclaims as a basis for personal jurisdiction and\nthe Court focuses on the ATA.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017871",
