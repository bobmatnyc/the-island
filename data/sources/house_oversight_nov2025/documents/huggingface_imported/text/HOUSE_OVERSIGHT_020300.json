In 2005,\nthis SVR’s “American” section in Moscow had begun methodically installing “sleeper agents” in\nthe US. Almost all of them were all Russian citizens who had assumed new identities to better\nblend into their communities.\n\nThe CIA learned of this sleeper program through Poteyev soon after it began. The issue was\nhow to exploit this knowledge. When I was writing my book on international deception, Angleton\nhad pointed out to me that “the business of intelligence services is understanding precisely the\nrelationship of their opposition to them.” His view, though his opponents inside the CIA would\ncall it with some justification an obsession, was that an intelligence service had focus on the\nmoves of its rivals. To accomplish this “business” in the first decade of the 21“ century, the CIA\nhad to establish why its new opposition, the SVR, was laying the foundation for an espionage\noperation. What were its priorities in the resumption of the intelligence war? Its inside man,\nPoteyev, in the SVR, provided it with a tremendous advantage in this relationship. It knew the\nlinks in a sleeper network that the SVR believed was safely hidden from surveillance. If they were\nfollowed, when they were activated they could expose whatever recruits the SVR had in the\nAmerican government. The CIA duly shared this information about the sleeper ring with the FBI,\nwhich had the responsibility for the surveillance of foreign agents in the United States, The FBI,\nfor its part, kept the Russian sleeper agents under tight surveillance—an operation which grew in\ncomplexity and expense as more SVR agents arrived in the US.\n\nMeanwhile, in Moscow, Poteyev was following the unfolding operation. Part of his SVR job\nwas to continue preparing these “Americans,” as they were called by the SVR, for their\nassignments. Some had been sent as couples, other as singletons. One of the singletons that\nPoteyev personally handled was Anna Kushchyenko. She was a strikingly beautiful Russian\nstudent, who changed her name to Anna Chapman by briefly marrying a British citizen she met at\narave party. After taking his name, she left him. After completing her training in Russia, the\nSVR sent her to New York City to establish herself as international real estate specialist. Other\n“Americans” under Poteyev’s watch became travel agents, students, and financial advisers. In all,\nPoteyev identified to the CIA twelve such sleeper agents. Since they had been instructed to\nsimply act out their role, while awaiting an intelligence assignment, they presented no real threat.\nEven so, the cost of FBI surveillance over the years became sizable. Around the clock\nsurveillance on the movements and communications of a single individual can cost, according to a\nformer FBI agent, over $10,000 a day.\n\nThe situation suddenly changed when the CIA received Poteyev’s message in 2010. It warned\nthat Russian military intelligence had asked the SVR to activate some of its sleeper agents for a\nhighly-sensitive assignment. Such a move suggested that Russian intelligence had found a\npossible source that could supply it with valuable information. According to a former CIA\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020300",
