  "text": "16\n\nIf only the Syrians could be brought around, presidents have believed\nfor generations, life would be so much easier. The United States\nwasn't alone in this illusion -- the Israelis, Arabs, Europeans,\n\nand Russians felt the same way. Like the Wall Street banks, Syria was\nthen, as it is now, judged as simply too big to fail. There was\nsomething perversely comforting about having the Assads around.\n\nI had my own fair share of illusions during my government career,\nbut the Assads were never one of them. I could never quite\nunderstand my colleagues' fascination with the brutal Syrian regime.\nTo me, Bashar al-Assad was a brutal dictator who wanted to be the\nFrank Sinatra of the Middle East -- obsessed with doing things his\nown way to the point that he priced himself out of peace with Israel\nand a relationship with the United States. It's striking that every other\nArab state, with the possible exception of Libya, managed to\nestablish a close relationship with the United States. Not Assad.\nThird, Obama's approach toward Syria has been managed by the\nrealists. This stands in contrast with his Libya policy, where liberal\ninterventionists in the administration and neocons outside clamored\nfor action. This group of realists includes the president, who knows\nhis options on Syria aren't great. He's being told that American\nleverage isn't great and that if he calls for Assad's head and the Syrian\ndespot survives, he'll have lost access to a key player in the region.\nAnd after all, what could he do that would deter a regime in a fight\nfor its life? Pull U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford from Damascus?\nImpose a travel ban on Assad and his family? Press the Europeans to\nfreeze Assad's money?\n\nIn a world of symbols, these steps may make an important point\nabout American values. However, none of them will make a\ndifference in how events play out in Syria.\n\nSimply put, the Obama administration is worried about creating\n\na worse situation if Assad falls. Take your pick of scary scenarios:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030075",
