take-it-or-leave-it deal by the U.S. on the
nuclear issue is the wrong strategy

Ray Takeyh

February 14, 2013 -- On Feb. 26, the United States and Iran will once
more resume their diplomatic ritual, in the so-called six-party talks, over
Iran's disputed nuclear program. As the two perennial adversaries eye one
another, there are competing paradigms about how to deal with Tehran.

An emerging school of thought suggests that the best means of "testing"
Iran is to offer it a final nuclear agreement that presumably promises
measurable relief from sanctions for significant Iranian concessions. Iran's
failure to grasp such an offer would then conclusively demonstrate to both
domestic and international audiences that the cause of the impasse is not
American belligerence but Iranian truculence.

But this approach fails to recognize that an arms-control process is
necessarily an incremental one, nor does it offer a practical substitute to
the existing step-by-step diplomacy.

Iran's nuclear program encompasses a vast complex of enrichment
facilities, centrifuge construction plants, uranium extraction companies
and thousands of scientists working in university and government
laboratories. Iran is enriching uranium at both 5% and 20% levels,
experimenting with high-velocity centrifuges and seemingly in the process
of constructing additional enrichment facilities.

Such a multilayered, multifaceted program can be dealt with only on a
piecemeal basis, as the technical details and rules for inspections are too
complex to be addressed in a single agreement.

Moreover, should the United States offer Iran a final deal, Tehran still has
a right to contest and negotiate its provisions and offer counterproposals.
