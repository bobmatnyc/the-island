From what I know EBRD’s 40% is\nconsidered exceptionally high as equity participation percentage comparing to their\nusual 10-15% and most probably they would be willing to listen to exit scenarios,\npossibly remaining as shareholders at a lower percentage.\n\nI think it is too early to discuss potential price but having EBRD inside already I\nwould assume that 1x less due diligence adjustments should be the maximum,\n\n17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026150",
