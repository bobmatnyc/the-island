  "text": "Since his arrival in the U.S., Guo has publicly detailed allegations of corruption in the\nChinese ruling party.\n\nThe Times reported that Broidy drafted a plan to enlist Emirati officials to pressure the U.S.\nto turn over Guo. In his statement to the newspaper, Broidy said he “never had a strategy or\nplan regarding Mr. Guo nor was there any compensation given or even discussed.”\n\nBroidy’s alleged efforts to push for Guo’s extradition came after Wynn separately helped\ndeliver a message from the Xi government seeking to have the dissident returned to China,\naccording to a person familiar with the effort.\n\nWynn, who has contacts with Chinese officials because of his business interests in Macau,\nhand-delivered a letter to Trump seeking Guo’s deportation, The Journal reported last year.\nA spokesman for Wynn Resorts has said that the report about Wynn’s role was false.\n\nAt the time, the president expressed interest in assisting the Chinese, but was met with\nresistance by senior law enforcement officials, according to the person.\n\nWhite House officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBrian M.
