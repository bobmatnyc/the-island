For example, people who\nvolunteer to be in the experimental arm\nof a study may be more gregarious by\nnature and may be more likely to\nbecome less lonely over time regardless\nof exposure to the intervention. Results\nof the meta-analysis suggested the\ninterventions might be effective, but to\nknow it’s the intervention and not an\nartifact of subject selection, we need to\nlook at the effect of these interventions\nwhen assessed using randomized group\ncomparison designs in which\nparticipants are randomly assigned to the\nexperimental or control group.\n\nTwenty-two studies utilized such\na design. Quantitative analysis revealed\nthat, on average, the interventions had a\nsmall but significant effect in reducing\nloneliness. Moreover, efficacy in\nreducing loneliness did not differ\nsignificantly as a function of\nintervention strategy nor as a function of\nindividual- versus group-based\nimplementation. Whereas once a\nconsensus existed that social skills\ntraining and/or group activities could\nreduce loneliness, we found insufficient\nevidence to support that conclusion.\n\nWhy have successful\ninterventions to reduce loneliness been\nso elusive? There are several possible\nreasons. Some of the interventions have\nbeen designed with the notion that if\nonly lonely individuals had better social\nskills they would be able to form\nsatisfying connections with others.\nHowever, recent research suggests that\nat least for most adults, the social skills\nthey know are not related to the\nloneliness they feel. Other interventions\nhave been developed with the notion that\nlonely individuals simply need to\ninteract more with others, so the\ninterventions are designed to increase\n\n134\n\nPage\n\ncontact with others. However, people\nnot only tend to like lonely individuals\nless than nonlonely individuals, lonely\nindividuals are especially negative\ntoward other lonely individuals.\nTherefore, bringing lonely individuals\ntogether is unlikely to result in warm,\nsatisfying social connections. Finally,\nsome interventions were designed with\nthe notion that what lonely individuals\nneed is social support, such as someone\nwho is available to provide help when\nneeded. However, loneliness affects not\nonly how people think, but how people\nthink about others: loneliness\ndiminishes people’s executive\nfunctioning and biases them to see others\nas threatening and rejecting even when\nthey are not (5).\n\nCacioppo and Patrick (5)\nproposed a framework for reducing\nloneliness which includes four elements.\nFirst, unconscious barriers that\nchronically lonely people develop to\nshield against being hurt by others tend\nto reduce their likelihood of having\npositive social interactions, and they\nmay benefit, therefore, from\nencouragement and practice in forming\nsocial connections gradually in “safe”\nenvironments where threat of rejection is\nminimal. For instance, because\nchronically lonely people are self-\nfocused in their hypervigilance for social\nthreat, they may benefit from learning to\nshift their attention from themselves to\nothers through other-oriented activities\nsuch as volunteerism. The notion is to\nintervene to diminish or eliminate the\nnegative effects loneliness can have on\nsocial perception and cognition. Second,\nwe tend to think of loneliness as the\nsame thing as a personal weakness, as\nbeing a social isolate, being depressed,\nor being weak. As noted above, we now\nknow these accounts to be incorrect, and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021380",
