  "text": "Equity styles\n\nUBS View Prefer value and large caps in Europe, mid caps in US\n¢ We recommend that investors look for value opportunities in Europe: The cheapest stocks within each\nsector are at extreme relative valuations, which should begin to normalize. Within Financials, however,\ninvestors should limit their direct exposure to the Eurozone debt crisis. We assess the cheapness of a stock\nby looking at its price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios relative to its peers.\n\n° We believe US mid caps will outperform large caps. US economic data is forecast to stabilize and GDP\ngrowth should be resilient in the second half of 2012. Greater domestic sales exposure reduces earnings\nrisk coming from Europe. In Europe, we prefer large over small caps in the current very challenging\neconomic environment.\n\n¢ High quality dividend paying stocks provide a real and stable income stream to investors during the\ncurrent low yield environment. Furthermore, they give exposure to the long term potential of equity\nmarkets while also providing some support in declining markets.\n\n4 Positive scenario Prefer value, low quality and small caps\n¢ Leading indicators continue to move higher, and risks related to the Eurozone debt crisis subside. In this\ncase, add deep cyclical value (cheap price/book, price/earnings) regardless of sector, with high beta and\nhigh leverage. In such an environment, small- and mid-cap stocks should also perform well, but a dividend\nstrategy would be too defensive to outperform the market.\n\n& Negative scenario Prefer quality and large caps\n¢ The global economic picture deteriorates markedly. In this case, buy high-quality growth companies and\nlarge caps. Do not look for value opportunities, but be as defensive as possible with your equity exposure.\nLook to high-quality, dividend-paying stocks for yield.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nEarnings revisions—see | Watch for signs of continued improvement in earnings revisions (aggregated\n\nchart from stock level). An improved earnings outlook would cause investors to add\n(3-month moving more risk, allowing multiples to expand and triggering the outperformance of\naverage upgrades vs. value stocks.\n\ndowngrades)\n\nUS and Eurozone PMIs If PMIs stabilize or improve, value stocks should outperform as there is no longer\n\njustification to pay the high price for earnings stability (quality). Key dates: 2\nJuly, PMI Manufacturing Eurozone; 2 July, US ISM Manufacturing\n\na UBS For further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Christopher Wright, christopher-zb.wright@ubs.com\n\nRegional differentiation\n\ne Within Europe, look for value\nopportunities within each sector, but be\naware of the higher-risk Financials.\n\ne In the US, there are opportunities in value\nnames that also show strong growth.\n\ne Within Europe, avoid small caps and\ninstead rotate into large caps.\n\ne In the US, prefer mid caps to large caps\nwhile GDP growth is above 2%.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne We expect value strategies to outperform\nthe market significantly over the long\nterm.\n\n¢ Mid-cap stocks provide attractive\nopportunities over the longer term.\n\nEuropean earnings revisions fell hard\nlast year, but the down cycle might be\nbe ending (net revisions, in %; MSCI\nEurope)\n30%\n20%\n\n10%\n\n0%\n\n-10%\n\n-20%\n-30%\n-40%\n-50%\n\n-60%\nJun.05 Jun.06 Jun.07 Jun.0&8 Jun.09 Jun.10 Jun.11  Jun.12\n\nSource: FactSet, UBS CIO, as of 27 June 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is no indication for future returns.\n\n21\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024156",
