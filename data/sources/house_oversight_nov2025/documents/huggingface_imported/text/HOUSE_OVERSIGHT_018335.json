The heat transfer had a simple message: Nothing is\nsafe.\n\nWhy put such effort, worthy of the deepest physics problems, into the challenge of\nsneaking into a cellphone undetected? Well, for Seaborn and Dullien, the drive was\npart of a “discover and publish” effort to keep the overall system clean. It is better to\nhack, discover and patch than to be hacked, and remain undiscovered. But these\n“good guy” engineers are racing against different, equivalently sophisticated, less-\ndecently inspired teams. The development and sale of zero-day bugs is, after all, a\nbusiness. Modern versions of Cap’n Crunch whistles crack access to some of the\nmost essential financial, political and security data stores on the planet. As the\npower and value of hacking targets has increased, so has the price of the exploits.\nPublic “zero day markets” sponsored by companies like Google and Microsoft pay\nhundreds of thousands of dollars to researchers who discover holes in their\nsystems. “Better to find them ourselves,” the thinking goes. Though that does not\nalways make the embarrassment less acute when holes are spotted. At one of the\nmost carefully watched public hacking competitions in early 2015, for instance, a\nskinny, smiling South Korean named Jung Hoon Lee took home $225,000 in prize\nmoney by pwning a series of some of the most important, common programs on the\nplanet, Apple’s web browser Safari and Google’s Chrome among them. These\nsystems had been constructed at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. They‘d\nbeen assembled under the gaze of some of the best PhD-led computer scientists in\nthe world. Jung Hoon Lee’s exploits ran through their complete defenses in less than\na minute. 144\n\nAs good and fast as someone like Lee might be, he’s nothing compared to what the\nbest hackers do. They don’t work in public or compete in hotel ballrooms. They\ndon’t brag. And they develop ideas that make $225,000 look like a bargain. These\nsuccessors to the Warez Dudes work for cybercriminal billionaires, for intelligence\nagencies, and even (often) just for themselves. They help find and deploy the sorts of\nreally deep system exploits that enable brazen cyber thefts of millions of pieces of\npersonal data or attacks like the Stuxnet virus, which caused thousands of Iranian\nnuclear centrifuges to vibrate themselves apart. And they do still more: Most of the\nattacks we've talked about so far occur in installed, running boxes. But the\ncompanies that make those boxes oversee a whole, vulnerable process of building\nand testing and designing and installing them. And it’s here, with billion dollar\nbudgets at work, that some exploit teams make and leave vulnerabilities that they\ncan later, ruthlessly exploit. Every step of that gestation — from sneaking secrets into\nearly code bases to intercepting and rewiring routers as they ship overseas — is now\nan opportunity for secret control. Or for unanticipated risk, for “emergent\n\n143 In a video: For a description of this exploit see Mordechai Guri, Matan Monitz,\nYisroel Mirski, Yuval Elovici, “BitWhisper: Covert Signaling Channel between Air-\nGapped Computers using Thermal Manipulations” (2015) available on\narXiv:1503.07919 [cs.CR]\n\n144 Jung Hoon Lee’s exploits: “Chrome, Firefox, Explorer, Safari Were All hacked at\nPwn2Own Contest”, PC World via IDG News Service Mar 20, 2015\n\n103\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018335",
