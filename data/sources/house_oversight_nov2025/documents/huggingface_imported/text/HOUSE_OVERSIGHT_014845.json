He has also produced other evidence that he relies upon to refute\nthe credibility of the allegations against him.\n\nThe parties believe it is time to take advantage of the new information that has come to\nlight on both sides during the litigation and put these matters behind them.\n\nGiven the events that have transpired since the filing of the documents in the federal\ncourt and in this action in which Dershowitz was accused of sexual misconduct, including\nthe court order striking the allegations in the federal court filings, and the records and\nother documents produced by the parties, Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a\nmistake to have filed sexual misconduct accusations against Dershowitz; and the sexual\nmisconduct accusations made in all public filings (including all exhibits) are hereby\nwithdrawn. Dershowitz also withdraws his accusations that Edwards and Cassell acted\nunethically.\n\nNeither Edwards, Cassell, nor Dershowitz have any intention of repeating the allegations\nagainst one another.\n\nHHH #\n\nEditor’s note: Wiley Rein LLP represents Alan M. Dershowitz in this matter.\n\nGM_00524\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014845",
