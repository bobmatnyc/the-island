He was referring to the similar approach that corporate human resource\ndivisions had with espionage agencies. Both “head hunt” by searching through a database of\npossible candidates for possible recruits to fill specific positions. Both type organizations have at\ntheir disposal researchers to draw up rosters of potential recruits. Both sort through available data\nbases to determine which of the names on the list have attributes that might qualify, or disqualify,\nthem for a recruitment pitch. Both also collect personal data on each qualified candidate,\nincluding any indication of their ideological leaning, political; affiliations, financial standing,\nambitions, and vanities, to help them make a tempting offer. But there are two important\ndifferences. First, unlike their counterparts in the private sectors, espionage headhunters ask their\ncandidates not only to take on a new job with them but to keep their employment secret from\ntheir present employer. Second, they ask them to surreptitiously steal documents from him.\n\nSince they are asking candidates to break the law, espionage services, unlike their corporate\ncounterparts in headhunting, obviously need to initially hide from the candidate the dangerous\nnature of the work they will do. Depending on the preferences of the targeted recruit, they might\ndisguise the task as a heroic act, such as righting an injustice, exposing an illegal government\nactivity, countering a regime of tyranny, or some other noble purpose. This disguise is called in\nthe parlance of the trade a “false flag.” By using such a false flag, the SVR did not need to find\ncandidate who were sympathy to Russia, or the Putin regime. In its long history dating back to the\nera of the Czars, Russian intelligence had perfected the technique of false flag recruitment through\nwhich it assumes an identity to fit the ideological bent of a potential recruit.\n\nRussian intelligence was well-experienced with false flags. It first used this technique\nfollowing the Bolshevik revolution in 1918 to control dissidents both at home and abroad. The\ncenterpiece, as later analyzed by the CIA, was known as the “Trust” deception. It began in\nAugust 1921 when a high-ranking official of the Communist regime in Russia named Aleksandr\nYakushev, slipped away from a Soviet trade delegation in Estonia and sought out a leading anti-\nCommunist exile he had known before the revolution in Russia. He then told him that he\nrepresented a group of disillusioned officials in Russia that included key members of the secret\npolice, army, and interior ministry. Yakushev said that they all had come to the same conclusion:\nthe Communist experiment in Russia had totally failed and needed to be replaced. To effect this\nregime change, they had formed an underground organization code-named the “Trust” because\nthe cover for their conspiratorial activities was the Moscow headquarters of the Municipal Credit\nAssociation, which was a trust company. According to Yakushev’s account, it had had become\nby 1921 the equivalent of a de facto government,\n\nThe exile leader in Estonia reported this astonishing news to British intelligence which, along\nwith French and American intelligence, helped fund this newly-emerged anti-Communist group.\nInitially British intelligence had doubts about the bona fides of the Trust. So did other Western\nintelligence services sponsoring exile groups. But they gradually accepted it after they received\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020326",
