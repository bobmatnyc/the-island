  "text": "greatest at what he does within the bounds he chooses to set. But I like answers as\n\nwell as questions. The five in my pantheon give me those.\n\nMozart is unrivalled at what he does because no one else plays the same game. What\nother composer has put such a premium on delicacy, on poise, on self-effacement?\nThat doesn’t deny that he was a red-blooded mensch who loved hijinks and good\ntimes as much as the rest of us. His Rondo alla Turca is one of many masterpieces\nshowing that side. But it only rounds out the impression of a flawless dinner\ncompanion. A maxim of classicism in the Greek spirit is “nothing in excess”. Mozart's\n\nexuberance and hijinks were just the right amount.\n\nHe was the master of moderation. His operas put passion mostly in the mouths of\nclowns and villains such as Papageno and Osmin and Queen of the Night. His\nsympathetic sorts have feelings too, but keep them circumspect. The perfect\ncompanion cares first about our feelings, not his. Mozart remains that even on our\njourneys together through the stars. We are kept safely away from the heat. We are\nallowed to feel anxiety because the world is so far below. That was half the point of\nthe trip. The other half is the happy ending as he leads us safely home. Anxiety, but\n\nnot in excess.\n\nThat shows him as the master of levitation. Richard Strauss gives the example of\nSusanna’s aria “Voi che sapete” (you who know) from Figaro, an innocent ditty\nwhich somehow never lands on the tonic (home note) until the end. The beginning\nof Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (a little night music) does this again. But the slow\n\nmovements of his piano concertos show it best.\n\nMozart is not my pantheon, even so. He is moderation in excess. I like the game the\nothers all play. I like a sense of the first person singular. The five in my pantheon\nalso take us through the stars. But they take us closer. We feel the heat because they\ndo. Listen to Bach’s chaconne for solo violin, or passacaglia and fugue for organ.\n\nListen to the heilige dankgesang (holy song of thanksgiving) from Beethoven’s\n\nChapter 10: Three Pantheons 2/10/16 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011124",
