Finally, the data was transferred off this auxiliary\ncomputer presumably to thumb drives or other external storage\ndevices. This download occurred just days before Snowden left the\nNSA on May 17, 2013, having told the agency that he needed a med-\nical leave of absence.\n\nThe quantity of stolen documents, 1.7 million, does not necessar-\nily reveal the damage and can itself be misleading. Many documents\ndo not reveal current or known sources or methods, and others may\nhave little value to an enemy. And a large portion of the documents\nmight have been duplications. The quality of some of these docu-\nments is another matter. Just one document that exposed a source\nor method of which enemies are unaware can be of immense value.\nOne such document taken by Snowden provided what Ledgett called\n“a roadmap” to the NSA’s current secret operations, revealing to an\nadversary such as Russia, China, or Iran “what we know, what we\ndon’t know, and, implicitly, a way to protect themselves.” There were\nmany documents in the Snowden breach that met these criteria,\n\n© according to a national security official at the Obama White House. ©\n\nGeneral Alexander closely followed the investigation as it devel-\noped over the summer of 2013.

The\ntimeline established by the government’s investigators did not\nmatch Snowden’s story line. “Something is not right,” Alexander\nsaid in an interview.\n\nFor one thing, Snowden had made the claim to journalists, four\nmonths after he was in Russia, that he had turned over all the\ndocuments he took from the NSA’s compartments to Poitras and\nGreenwald in Hong Kong. On August 18, the investigators had the\nopportunity to examine the files that Snowden had given to Poitras\nand Greenwald. This discovery came when British authorities, under\nSchedule 7 of Britain’s Terrorism Act, detained David Miranda,\nGreenwald’s romantic partner, at Heathrow Airport.
