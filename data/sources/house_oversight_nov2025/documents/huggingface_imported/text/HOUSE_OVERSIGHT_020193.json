He also demonstrated that such a theft, which the NSA calculates\nexceeded one million documents, can go undetected for at least two weeks. If Snowden managed\nthis feat on his own, as he claims in his Hong Kong video, it suggests that any other civilian\nemployee with a perceived grievance against NSA practices or American foreign policy could also\nwalk away with some of the most precious secrets held by US intelligence. Such vulnerability\nextends to tens of thousands of civilian contract employees in positions similar to the one held by\nSnowden. The lone disgruntled employee explanation is therefore hardly reassuring. If true, calls\ninto question the entire multi-billion dollar enterprise of outsourcing the management of the\nNSA’s computer networks and other technical work to outside contractors. It also casts doubts\non the post-9/11 decision by the intelligence community to strip away much of the NSA’s “stove-\npiping” that previously insulated the NSA’s most sensitive computers. Without such “stove-\npiping,” any rogue civilian employee could bring down entire edifice of shared intelligence.\n\nNor would a finding by the investigation that Snowden had acted in concert with others in\nbreaching compartments at the NSA be any more reassuring. Such collaboration among\nintelligence workers would reflect gravely on the mindset of the NSA. Snowden described an\natmosphere in which intelligence workers exchanged lewd photographs of foreign suspects. Did\nthis violation of the NSA’s rules also involve abetting the theft of documents? If so, the NSA\nwould have to evaluate further vulnerabilities that might arise when it entrusts its secrets to\ntechnicians who do not share is values. A collaborative breach would signal an immense failure of\nthe present concept of the counterintelligence regime in the NSA.\n\nFrom what I gathered from government officials who were familiar with the investigation, there\nwas a concern that answering the “how” question could open up a Pandora Box of other issues\nconcerning the very ability of the NSA to carry out its core mission of protecting the\ngovernment’s intelligence secrets. However it was organized, it was that clear that Snowden had\nplayed a major role in what amounted to a brilliant intelligence coup.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020193",
