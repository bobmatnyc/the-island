  "text": "Global economic outlook - Summary\n\nKey questions\n\ne Can emerging markets (EM) continue to offset developed market (DM) weakness to buoy global\ngrowth?\n\ne What are the risks of near-term faltering of the US economic recovery?\n\ne When is the European economy likely to return to sustainable economic expansion?\n\nCIO View (Probability: 60%*)\n\n¢ Global economic activity remains moderate; the growth impulse stems largely (some 80%) from the EM\nregion. As expected, China started to ease monetary policy. The country is better placed than other EM\nand particularly DM countries to counter growth weakness with further monetary and fiscal stimuli. Thus,\nwe expect EM growth to stabilize soon and pick up in 2H 2012.\n\ne US economic indicators have on balance been disappointing recently, especially data related to business\nfixed investment and employment growth. Thus, we lowered our 2Q 2012 real GDP growth forecast to an\nannualized rate of 1.5% from 2%. We still expect growth slightly above 2% in 2H 2012. We think that the\nrisk that the Fed will take measures in addition to the extension of \"Operation Twist\" is still significant.\n\ne Large parts of Western Europe are in recession or stagnation. We expect the economies of the Eurozone\nand the UK to show mild improvement in 2H 2012. Still, economic activity is likely to remain very sluggish\ndespite support from lower oil prices and less rigorous fiscal austerity. The Bank of England may support\nthe UK economy by increasing its amount of bond purchases soon. The probability that the ECB will take\nfurther action to support the economy has risen significantly.\n\nA” Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*)\n\ne The Eurozone crisis abates. Financial market conditions recover, mitigating the drag from fiscal austerity.\n¢ Growth in Western Europe is marginally positive (Eurozone stagnates) in 2012 and the US economy\ngrows moderately above trend.\n\ni Negative scenario (Probability: 25%*)\n\ne There are three key downside risks to the global economy: 1. a significant escalation of the Eurozone\ndebt crisis; 2. a sharp fiscal contraction in the US, and 3. a sharp deceleration of the Chinese economy. Each\none of these risks could precipitate a significant downturn of the global economy.\n\nKey dates\n\n2 July USA: ISM manufacturing PMI for June\n\n5 July Eurozone: ECB press conference\n\n24 July Eurozone: purchasing managers indices (PMI), July estimates\n22-25 July = China: HSBC flash manufacturing purchasing managers index (Jul)\n\n36 UBS\n\nGlobal growth expected at just under\n3% in 2012\n\nReal GDP growth in % Inflation in %\n\n2011 2012F = =2013F 2011 2012F =. 2013F\n\nAmericas US 17 21 2.6 3.1 2.1 V7\nCanada 24 Zerik 24 2. eh Bad\n\nBrazil 29 2.0 48 65 5.2 65\n\nAsia/Pacific Japan -0.7 2:5 2.0 -0.3 6.2) 05\nAustralia 2.1 3.2 35 3.4 16 25\n\nChina 9.2: 82 85 5.4 3.0 40\n\nIndia 65 6.0 7.0 7.8 69 7\n\nEurope Eurozone als: -0.4 04 27 Wins: 2.0\nGermany Sul 1.0 1.1 25 1.7 TS\n\nFrance rs 3 0.4 ell en Lok\n\nItaly 05 -1.8 02 29 3.4 39\n\nSpain O7 -1.6 -1.3 Sul ee) 9\n\nUK 07 0.2 igs 45 2.8 1.9\n\nSwitzerland Ael 13 flock 0.2 0.4 1.4\n\nRussia 43 3.8 a7 85 4g 6.9\n\nWorld oe 28 333 3.3) 30 3.0\n\nFor further information please contact ClIO economist Dirk Faltin, dirk.faltin@ubs.com\n\nSource: UBS CIO, as of 28 June 2012\n\nIn developing the ClO economic forecasts, CIO economists\nworked in collaboration with economists employed by UBS\nInvestment Research.
