  "text": "Keating says: \"It's because president Mitterrand and the French wanted it. They weren't\nready to sit beside the German unified state without some friends.\"\n\nSo the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: \"The\nproblem is we have a single currency without a political union and without a fiscal union.\"\n\nThe second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For\nKeating, this was recklessness for which the world may yet pay.\n\n\"Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order,\" he says.\n\"But that didn't happen. So Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian\nnationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nWho is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton.\n\nOn the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan\nmust bear \"a fair amount of responsibility”.\n\n“Greenspan is someone | know and like,\" Keating says. \"But if you are so naive to believe\nthat institutions with a balance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident\nwaiting to happen then you don't deserve to be chairman of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nHe praises Obama for seeking a return to the \"liberal internationalism\" that, in Keating's\nview, made the US great in the post-World War Il age. This is the US he loves but it is still\nin retreat.\n\nAsked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: \"| believe\nthere is a poetic strand to life that doesn't exist in an economics textbook.\n\n“This is not to say that rationalism isn't important and good. It is. But left to itself without\nthe guidance of higher meaning and a higher concept, rationalism can be mean and\nincomplete. | say if you simply live on rational policy and briefing notes you are not\nsufficiently informed.\n\n\"You need a higher calling or some inner system of belief - here | mention Kant and the\ninner command that tells you what is true, what is right, what is good. The inner\ncommand must be the divining construct in what you do.\n\n\"Music has always been a large part of what makes me tick. You listen to a great work. .\n. you hear the majesty of these works and your head and soul gets caught up in them.\nWhen that happens you are in for bigger things and you will strike out to be better.\n\n\"When | was listening to music | would always have the pad out to write the ideas down.\"\n\nhttp://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/paul-keating-explains-as-never-\nbefore/story-e6frg74x-1226173493029\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029669",
