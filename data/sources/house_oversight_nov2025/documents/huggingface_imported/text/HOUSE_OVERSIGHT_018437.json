  "text": "power finally achieved real grip. Recall that important distinction between\n“Predictive Learning” and “Representational Learning” - and how machines with a\ndeep representation outperformed the ones merely predicting, the difference\nbetween recognizing a Mozart symphony and writing one? We ourselves need to\nmove now from predictive to representational views of our world. We need an\nhistorical sense, of course. But something else too, that Seventh Sense I’ve been\nwriting about. So much of what lies ahead can’t, of course, be predicted by looking at\nwhat has come before. And we won't make this leap to a new representation of the\nworld around us with mere technology. That passage to a new, and subtle insight, to\na new instinct, demands wisdom.\n\nThere will be a point, several hundred years from now, when the answers to the\nfundamental questions we now face will be decided. A new political order, tuned to\nthe power laws now visible with the Seventh Sense will emerge. Our question we\nwill often ask on that long passage is this: Can more and more technology bridge the\ngap between the ideal society we might aim for and the troubled one we have? Or\nmight it crank that gap wider still? My sense is that the antidote to the machines and\ntheir new logic is not, in the end to make ourselves more like the machines.\nEncryption alone won't protect our privacy. Mobility won’t assure our liberty. We\ncan’t keep up with the innovations, to be honest. So we have to go deeper. Our\nprotection will come from making ourselves more human, not just more technical.\nWe should consider the path Su Dongpo’s life suggest, the cultivation of an inner\ninstinct, and that this should touch on the very things that make us most human.\nThis means to make ourselves more political, more cultured, more aware of history\nand ideas. Which problems do we solve with technology? Which ones with our own\nhearts and minds? This choice, at least, is still before us.\n\nTake a moment. Look at yourself. Feel yourself with the Seventh Sense. Through\neach of us now will flow all the power of this new age. Yes, it can jack apart all our\nold habits and fill the passage of our time with all the dangers of evil as we silently\nwatch terrible and fearful things appear from nowhere. But we can also wake up,\nsee the world accurately and then act with the confidence of knowing that we are,\neach of us, the passage through with which the future will emerge. At the very\nmoment we might feel so many of our burdens lifted by technology, an old and\nheavy one crashes down upon us. It is the burden of maintaining our liberty. Now,\nyou and me are, like it or not, what we are connected to.\n\n205\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018437",
