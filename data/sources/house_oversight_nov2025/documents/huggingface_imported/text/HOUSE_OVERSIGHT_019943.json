  "text": "On Friday, February 3, at breakfast at the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown, an epicenter\nof the swamp, Ivanka Trump, flustered, came down the stairs and entered the dining room,\ntalking loudly on her cell phone: “Things are so messed up and I don’t know how to fix\n\nThe week had been overwhelmed by continuing fallout from the immigration order—\nthe administration was in court and headed to a brutal ruling against it—and more\nembarrassing leaks of two theoretically make-nice phone calls, one with the Mexican\npresident (“bad hombres”) and the other with the Australian prime minister (“my worst\ncall by far’). What’s more, the day before, Nordstrom had announced that it was dropping\nIvanka Trump’s clothing line.\n\nThe thirty-five-year-old was a harried figure, a businesswoman who had had to\nabruptly shift control of her business. She was also quite overwhelmed by the effort of\nhaving just moved her three children into a new house in a new city—and having to do\nthis largely on her own. Asked how his children were adjusting to their new school several\nweeks after the move, Jared said that yes, they were indeed in school—but he could not\nimmediately identify where.\n\nStill, in another sense, Ivanka was landing on her feet. Breakfast at the Four Seasons\nwas a natural place for her. She was among everyone who was anyone. In the restaurant\nthat morning: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi; Blackstone CEO Stephen\nSchwarzman; Washington fixture, lobbyist, and Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan; labor\nsecretary nominee Wilbur Ross; Bloomberg Media CEO Justin Smith; Washington Post\nnational reporter Mark Berman; and a table full of women lobbyists and fixers, including\nthe music industry’s longtime representative in Washington, Hillary Rosen; Elon Musk’s\nD.C. adviser, Juleanna Glover; Uber’s political and policy executive, Niki Christoff; and\nTime Warner’s political affairs executive, Carol Melton.\n\nIn some sense—putting aside both her father’s presence in the White House and his\ntirades against draining the swamp, which might otherwise include most everyone here,\nthis was the type of room Ivanka had worked hard to be in. Following the route of her\nfather, she was crafting her name and herself into a multifaceted, multiproduct brand; she\nwas also transitioning from her father’s aspirational male golf and business types to\naspirational female mom and business types. She had, well before her father’s presidency\ncould have remotely been predicted, sold a book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules\nfor Success, for $1 million.\n\nIn many ways, it had been an unexpected journey, requiring more discipline than you\nmight expect from a contented, distracted, run-of-the-mill socialite. As a twenty-one-year-\nold, she appeared in a film made by her then boyfriend, Jamie Johnson, a Johnson &\nJohnson heir. It’s a curious, even somewhat unsettling film, in which Johnson corrals his\nset of rich-kid friends into openly sharing their dissatisfactions, general lack of ambition,\nand contempt for their families.
