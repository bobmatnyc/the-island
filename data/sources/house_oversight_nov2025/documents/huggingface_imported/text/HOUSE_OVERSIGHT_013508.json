  "text": "modern dynamical system’s theory describes a convolution of the expansive\nmotions (as in the upper world) and contractive motions (as in the lower world)\nembedded naturally in the curved time and space geometries of what are called\nhyperbolic spaces. Each point in this space can be visualized as a little saddle in\nwhich orbital flows from pommel and back flow down to the seat, bringing points\ntogether in contracting motion, and flows away from seat down along the sides are\nexpanding the distance between nearby points.. In the middle of the saddle,\nsimultaneously expansive and contracting orbits demonstrate hyperbolic stability\ncomposed of intersecting destabilizing and stabilizing influences. Loss of this\ncountervailing hyperbolic dynamical stability results in global system\ntransformations called bifurcations and/or phase transitions.\n\nTransformation as a loss of stability is a theme of a recent poetic translation\nof portions of the Zohar called Dreams of Being Eaten Alive by David Rosenberg.\nHe writes that at some time in the difficult journey through the often-\nincomprehensible Zohar, in order to gain entrance to the kabalistic cosmos, there\narose what he called “heartbreak.” “No matter how much intellectual study is\ninvolved, the reader cannot understand the text unless he or she has offered his\nheart to be broken on the altar of poetry...and prayer.” Surrender may be the source\nof the strange, uplifting feeling of worked through dumbness.\n\nMy mother, once a conservatory teaching assistant in piano, sat beside me\nwhile | practiced almost daily, weekends included, from the age of two until the\nmidteens. Her quiet analytic counter-point sounded mathematical, “You can hear\nthat that this harmonic progression goes through intervals of fourths of dominant\nseventh chords.” | felt the persistent lack of harmonic resolution as growing tension\nin my groin. “If you transform each of the 12 notes in a chromatic scale, multiplying\nit by five (in what mathematicians call) mod 712 (the numbering system goes from\none to twelve, not ten, before it repeats), one can recover the circle of fourths, the\ncommonest harmonic chord progression in music.” Though her computational talk\nsupported rational thought, in my adolescent heat, the addition of Charley Parker’s\nflatted fifth and ninth to the dominant seventh chord led suddenly somewhere else\n\nand she knew it. Hearing my arrangement of a Beethoven piano piece become a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013508",
