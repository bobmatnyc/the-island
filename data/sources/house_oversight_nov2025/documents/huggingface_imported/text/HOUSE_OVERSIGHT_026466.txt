Jeffrey --

Did you see my son’s email on Sunday?

I was so proud to see him speak at the Women’s March this weekend, joining thousands of
passionate Floridians who want real change in our state, and across the country.

But we both know that change doesn’t come easy. And there are a lot of folks in Tallahassee
that want to keep things the same as usual.

We can’t afford the status quo so they can have their way. We need leadership that will
bring the change that so many have been marching for over the past year.

Can I count on you to help my son bring that change to Tallahassee?

Click here to join his campaign today, and help him do the right thing for our
neighbors across the state.
