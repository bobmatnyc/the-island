  "text": "already do.\" Even as I said it, I wondered why I was still talking to a guy who'd just said\nthat men don't want to date women as smart as they are. | felt like a bad feminist.\n\n\"Oh, you shouldn't tone yourself down!\" said Mr. Ambition. \"It makes you attractive...\nAttractive intellectually, I mean.\"\n\nI sighed. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Intellectually.”\n\n\"I'm sorry,” he said again.\n\n\"I'm going home,\" I said.\n\n\"We're still friends, right?” he asked.\n\n\"Yes, but give me some time to get over this,\" I said. \"Probably about a month.”\n\n\"What do you mean?\" He came after me as I walked to the door. \"Like, you don't want to\nsee me at all for a month? You don't want me to call you, or reach out to you, or\nanything?\"\n\nI looked at him, again, for a long moment. I regretted his stricken expression. Again, I\nspoke as gently as I could. \"Maybe in a month.\"\n\nHe offered me a ride, which I declined. My fifteen-minute estimate was almost on target:\ntwenty minutes later, I stepped into my bedroom, leaned back against my door and burst\ninto tears.\n\nte Kk ok\n\nI ran into Richard the next evening, and we spent the night together. Richard put a fair\namount of effort into convincing me to talk to Mr. Ambition.\n\n\"It sounds like he didn't actually mean to break up with you,\" said Richard. \"It sounds\nlike the conversation got away from him. He didn't start that conversation intending to\nbreak up with you; maybe he was looking for reassurance, and you approached his\nquestions too logically, and he concluded that you don't care. You really like him. It\nseems like it's worth trying to make it work.\"\n\nYou may have noticed that both of these men tried hard to convince me that the other\nman cared about me. I decline to analyze what that means about me and my current\napproach to relationships.\n\nHowever, I will say that I tried giving Richard more emotional feedback than I have in a\nlong time; I even told him I missed him the next time he went on vacation. And I did try\ntalking to Mr. Ambition again, and he acknowledged that he hadn't exactly intended to\nbreak up with me.\n\nBut then Mr. Ambition and I had several of those encounters that I think of as \"post-\nbreakup talks.\" I hate that shit. Every evening ended on a confusing, inconclusive note.\nHe kept saying that he was \"confidently ambiguous.\" We weren't dating, we weren't not\ndating. It reminded me of a phase I went through with a college ex-boyfriend, back in my\nmonogamous days: my ex and I spent several weeks post-breakup being \"exclusive but\nnot together.\" So preposterous. People are so broken.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018628",
