  "text": "Prejean’ s Miss USA crown. And another thing. You promised to end the\nraids on medical marijuana dispensaries, but they haven’ t stopped.\n\n[In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder issued a memo ordering an\nend to federal raids of medical marijuana dispensaries. In March 2011,\nthere were 28 such raids in a duration of 24 hours.]\n\nHere’ s how | understand Washington. America’ s_ puritanical\npolitical process serves as a buffer between the status quo and the force of\nevolution. For instance, in order to get Republican votes for the children’ s\nhealthcare bill, Democrats agreed to fund $28 million to the/r abstinence-\nonly program.\n\nAnd, during your own campaign, you admitted, in the context of\nhealth care reform, that the multinational insurance conglomeration is so\nfirmly entrenched that you would be unable to dispense with it. So there\nwould have to be compromises. Now, what with the compromises made to\nhelp passage of Prop. 19, amnesty becomes the single-payer system of\nmarijuana reform, and growing your own pot becomes the public option.\nMeanwhile, as long as any government can arbitrarily decide which drugs\nare legal and which drugs are illegal, then anyone serving time for a\n\nnonviolent drug offense is a political prisoner.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015325",
