  "text": "si\n\nqualities America inspires would warm the heart of any marketing\nmanager.\n\nAs an ice-breaking exercise, I asked everyone I interviewed on my\ntrip to free-associate the first word they thought about when they hear\n“America.” There were numerous cynics (“greedy,” “consumerism,”\n“McDonald’s’’) and the occasional outlier (“Sex and the City”), but a\nmajority repeated affirmative terms like melting pot, power,\ndemocracy, modernity. Even a majority of jaded Newsweek—Daily\nBeast poll respondents said that the U.S. had a positive effect on the\nworld—the highest of any nation we asked about. Blend it all\ntogether, and that’s an image of America well positioned for the new\nArab World.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025027",
