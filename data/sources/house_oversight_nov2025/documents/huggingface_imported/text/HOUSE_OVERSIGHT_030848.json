Morgan View\nLocal forces are dominating\n� Asset allocation –– Local risks and opportunities trump global forces in\ndriving investment opportunities. Cross-market correlations to remain much\nlower than in recent years.\n� Economics –– US activity data are coming in better than hoped, but we\nneed another 1-2 months to see how consumers are responding to higher\ntaxes.\n� Fixed Income –– Search for carry to trump Euro area jitters over time.\n� Equities –– Japan remains our main country overweight.\n� Credit –– We OW covered bonds in the Euro periphery over senior bank\nbonds and subordinated vs senior bank bonds in the core.\n� Currencies –– Cyprus to have minimal further impact on EUR, but a ECB\nrate cut would push it a few cents lower versus the dollar.\n� Commodities –– Stay long Brent and short gasoline.\n� US stocks continue to gain, with the benchmark S&P500 breaching its\nall time high level today in a gentle fashion. Bonds are generally up this\nweek on dovish comments from both the Fed and the BoJ. Commodities\nhave gained also, but credit remains the troubled asset class with spreads\nwider in most markets, especially in EM external debt.\n� Our overall investment theme remains that there is no overarching\nglobal investment theme anymore this year but instead a number of\nunrelated local forces that have largely local impact. The generalized\nasset reflation we saw last year, with risk premia coming down consistently\nacross the globe and asset classes, was due to a gradual fading of tail risks\nthat has since been largely completed. “Risk-on, risk- off is so last year”.\n� In addition, we are seeing no momentum either way in global growth,\nprice or earnings expectations that could put us into a bullish or bearish\ngrowth story. Our 2.4% projection for 2013 world economic growth is\nunchanged since November. YTD activity data for the world are tracking\nour 2.6% forecast for Q1, comfortably up from the dismal 1.6% in Q4 of last\nyear. Amidst offsetting up- and downside surprises in the US and Japan\nversus Europe, there has been no reason yet to raise the growth profile for\nthe year as a whole. We hope, but need evidence first.\n� Without a global growth or fading-of-tail-risks force, we are left with a set\nof local issues and opportunities that are having a local impact, at the\nregional, asset class and company level, that should leave the rest of the\nworld largely unmoved. In this environment, correlations across regions\nand risk markets should remain significantly lower than in past years.\nVarious markets may seem to behave “inconsistently” with others, but we\ncaution against expecting simple mean reversion, given our view of the\nreduced impact of global factors. Active investors should pay more attention\nto local fundamentals while long-term investors can expect to achieve\ngreater gains from cross-market and international diversification.\nGlobal Asset Allocation\nJan Loeys AC\n(1-212) 834-5874\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com\nJPMorgan Chase Bank NA\nJohn Normand\n(44-20) 7134-1816\njohn.normand@jpmorgan.com\nJ.P.

Morgan View\n28 March 2013\n�\n�\n�\n�\nLocal issues must be monitored and understood, though, to decide how to\nallocate capital and risk. Just to review a few, Japanese policy makers\ncontinue to present a concerted plan to reflate their economy through\nmonetary, fiscal and structural measures. The strong control of the\ngovernment and its high approval rating are steadily raising the chance of\nsuccess. We stay overweight Japanese equities and grow wary of the short yen\ntrade, as capital inflows and rising growth expectations (chart of right) are\nultimately bullish for the currency. Watch next week’s BoJ meeting, led by\nnewly appointed Governor Kuroda, for new reflationary measures.\nThe Euro area economy remains in recession, while policy makers are\nmaking little effort to reverse the contraction. We monitor signs of any large\ndeposit flight post Cyprus over coming weeks and months to judge whether\nthe bailout may actually be worsening conditions in the Euro. Economic\nforecast momentum remains negative (chart of right). These are good reasons\nto underweight the Euro area, if not all of Europe, across asset classes, against\nthe rest of the world.\nThe US, in contrast, is seeing better spending from both corporates and\nconsumers than we could have expected post Fiscal Cliff and sequestration.\nBut given the huge amount of fiscal drag, which is a fact, we want to see\nanother 1-2 months of data before extrapolating the good news. It did support\nUS equities in recent weeks, which continue to benefit from US corporates\nissuing debt to buy their own shares and others', through M&A. This corporate\nrotation from debt to equities is almost exclusively a US flow, which helps\nexplain US equity outperformance.\nAcross risk assets, we are similarly seeing huge delinking, with equities\nrallying greatly and commodities and credit seeing no gains (chart p. 1), very\nmuch unlike last year. Commodities are delinking as there are no growth\nupgrades in EM, and inflation concerns are concentrated on two countries, UK\nand Japan. Credit is delinking as most investors are massively overweight\ncredit versus equities, as evidenced by the disparity in buying flows in 2011-\n12. Relevering by US corporate and the Fed debating the end of QE are\nsignaling that the 3-decade long rally in bonds is likely over. Investors are\nstarting to dollar-average away from bonds to equities.\nFixed Income\n�\n�\n�\nBonds rallied again, except for Euro area peripherals, the source of this\nweek’s market concerns. The imposition of capital controls on Cypriot\ndeposits is to be sure a watershed moment, but for now not one we expect to\nspark significant deposit withdrawals elsewhere. Meanwhile, the most likely\noutcome to the Italian impasse appears to be new elections in the autumn.\nWith seemingly little prospect of a material rise in yields on the safest assets,\nwe think the search for carry evident across the full gamut of asset markets\nwill see peripheral spreads narrow over time.\nTen-year JGB yields have rallied to within a few bps of their all-time low,\nahead of next week’s inaugural meeting for the new BoJ leadership. We do\nindeed expect aggressive easing, with JGB purchases out to 30 years, but\nthink this will be trumped by profit taking in JGBs after the fiscal year end.\nOur latest Inflation Expectations Survey (F. Diamond, K. Gupta) was out\nyesterday. One interesting result is that almost 90% of respondents believe the\nBoJ has less than a 50/50 shot of hitting its 2% inflation target in two years, a\nreflection of the formidable challenge of sparking inflation expectations after\ntwo decades of falling prices.\n2013 Japan GDP growth forecasts: JPMorgan and\nConsensus\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\nJan-12 Apr-12 Jul-12 Oct-12 Jan-13\nSource: J.P.

Morgan View\n28 March 2013\nEquities\n�\n�\n�\n�\nThe global rally in equity markets slowed this week, but did not reverse, on\ncontinued concerns about the fallout from a poorly executed Cyprus solution.\nThe Euro area underperformed again, for a second week in a row. As\ndiscussed last week, we view Cyprus as a local problem that we address by\nunderweighting Euro area equities in a global portfolio. A potential negative\nfeedback loop from markets to the economy poses a serious downside risk for\nEuro area growth over coming months prolonging the current run of negative\neconomic surprises from the region.\nJapan is the region we like the most. In our mind the Japanese equity trade\nhas further legs not only due to prospective BoJ balance sheet expansion but\nmore importantly due to a reform agenda to be unveiled into the summer.\nEM equities are suffering from renewed policy tightening in major EM\neconomies such as Brazil and China. Investors have bitter memories of\nprevious property tightening measures in China. As within DM, we see a lot\nof divergences within EM and prefer to focus on under-owned markets with\ngood domestic demand story such as Mexico and Malaysia. See “Consensus\nAsset Allocation”, Adrian Mowat and team, Mar 26th. Open overweights in\nMexican and Malaysia equities vs MSCI EM.\nFor long-term investors we just released our quarterly publication \"Trade\nopportunities for long term investors\" Mar 27. We monetize risk premia in\nValue stocks via a long in S&P500 Value vs S&P500 ETFs. It appears that a\nfive year long underperformance of Value stocks has come to an end. We take\nprofit on trades that monetize skew risk premia in S&P500 due to sharp\ncontraction over the past quarter. We continue to monetize equity risk premia\nvia buying high dividend yield equity ETFs against USTs. Our preference is\nto buy ETFs which track the S&P US Preferred stock due to its high yield,\naround 6%, and its high weight on Financials.\nCredit\n�\n�\n�\nThe news flow from the Cypriot bailout continued to push spreads wider\nand vol higher this week, with European Financials underperforming as\ncreditor bail-in risks returned to the forefront. iTraxx senior and subordinated\nfinancials indices widened 20bp as investors sought to hedge via CDS rather\nthan sell bonds. European credit continued to underperformed US credit.\nThe fact that Cypriot banks debt is only 1.3% of total liabilities was a key\nfactor in the decision to bail-in depositors. Yet events surrounding the banking\nsector restructuring also suggest that keeping senior unsecured\nbondholders immune from costly bail-outs is politically untenable. This\nremoves the implicit ‘cover’ that senior bonds holders have enjoyed and has\nincreased speculation that implementation of the bail-in proposals under the\nEU’s Resolution & Recovery Directive (RRD) will be brought forward to\n2015 from the current 2018 time-frame.\nAs such, our colleagues in European Credit have examined the implications of\nchanging recovery rate expectations across the bank capital structure.\nAssuming that covered bonds remain outside the scope of the proposals, we\nexpect senior bank bond spreads to widen relative to covered bonds and\nprefer being OW covered bonds vs senior bonds in the periphery,\nparticularly in Spain where covered bonds have first claim over the entire\nmortgage book of the bank. From a relative value point of view, we also\nsuggest owning subordinated bank bonds vs senior bank bonds in the core\nas, under the new RRD regime, there is a higher probability than before that\nMore details in ...\nUS Credit Markets Outlook and Strategy, Eric Beinstein\net al.\nHigh Yield Credit Markets Weekly, Peter Acciavatti et al.\nEuropean Credit Outlook & Strategy, Steven Dulake et\nal.\nEmerging Markets Cross Product Strategy Weekly, Eric\nBeinstein et al.\n3\nJan Loeys\n(1-212) 834-5874\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com\nGlobal Asset Allocation\nThe J.P. Morgan View\n28 March 2013\nsenior bank bond holders will lose money and this risk is, in our mind, not yet\nin the price (Rethinking the capital structure, R. Henriques et al., Mar 27).\nForeign Exchange\n�\n�\n�\nToday’s research note, Sacrificing Cyprus, examines several presumptions\nwhich have arisen over the past two weeks due to the Cyprus crisis, and scores\nthem on a scale of truths, half-truths and falsehoods. There are indeed some\nright conclusions to draw from this experience, but also some wrong ones. As\nexamples, it is true that capital controls have created a two-tier euro, but very\nunlikely that Cyprus is exiting EMU. And while it is true that markets deserve\na risk premium for policy uncertainty, the size of the premium should be much\nlower than in previous crises due to backstops like the OMT.\nFor example, during the first Greek crisis in May 2010 EUR undershot by\n10% relative to cyclical conditions at that time, and during Greek elections in\nMay 2012 the currency undershot by 5%. The combination of Italian and\nCypriot events have eliminated the euro’s overvaluation from early 2013,\nwhen the currency spiked to the high $1.30s on a presumption that LTRO\nfunds would be repaid rapidly, driving European rates higher. The currency is\nnow close to fair value, so carries no risk premium for contagion. The\nmessage is similar in vol markets: the 1% premium for 3-mo implied versus\nrealized vol is far less than the 5% premium witnessed during previous crises.\nWhile there is no evidence that the EUR/USD cash or options market carries a\nrisk premium, it is also true that the required premium should probably be far\nless than in previous crises given that a sovereign funding backstop like the\nOMT is in place. We are thus reluctant to extrapolate this mini-crisis into a\nsystemic event which triggers broad deleveraging, or to forecast trend euro\nweakness. The currency could trade down a couple of cents around an ECB\nrate cut, but assuming that fears around Cyprus contagion pass in a month or\ntwo, the currency should reverse its recent decline by the summertime.\nCommodities\n�\n�\nCommodities rallied this week, up almost 2%, led by energy. We went\ntactically long Brent in last week’s J.P. Morgan View as we believed that the\ncorrection in oil markets had brought prices too far below our price forecast of\n$112/bbl. Since then Brent is up around 1.5%. We stay long and expect\nfurther price appreciation over coming months. We are also short gasoline vs.\nBrent. Gasoline cracks (the premium for gasoline over crude prices) spiked\nover the first three months of the year due to a combination of low inventories\nand refinery closures that came during refinery maintenance season. As\nrefinery maintenance comes to a close and demand falls seasonally, gasoline\nprices should fall relative to Brent.\nWe went long Soybean time spreads late last year (GMOS, Dec 5) on a view\nthat much higher Brazilian supplies would find it difficult to leave the country\ndue to logistical constraints. Since then we have seen a record number of ships\nplanning to load soybeans in Brazilian ports and this number is still rising.\nThe average waiting time before loading is also rising, now 38 days compared\nto 26 days a month ago. This has caused the front Soybean contract to rally\nwhile longer maturity contracts have been depressed by the much higher than\nnormal supply inside the country. The spread between the May-13 and Jul-13\ncontracts has doubled since we put the trade on in December. We stay long as\nwe think these logistical issues are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.\nFX weekly change in USD\n0.8%\n0.6%\n0.4%\n0.2%\n0.0%\n-0.2%\n-0.4%\n-0.6%\n-0.8%\n-1.0%\nUSD\nTWI\nSource: J.P.
