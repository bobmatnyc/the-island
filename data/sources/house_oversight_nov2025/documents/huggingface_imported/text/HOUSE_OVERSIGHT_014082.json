  "text": "2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 103\nvictims.”° The decision by state legislators to extend notification or\nconferral rights to crime victims demonstrates an express recognition that\ncrime victims’ meaningful participation in the criminal justice process may\ninvolve granting those victims rights before indictment.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCrime victims have important rights at stake in the criminal justice\nprocess, even before prosecutors formally file criminal charges. It is hardly\nsurprising, therefore, to find that a federal law that Congress in fact\ndesigned to create “broad and encompassing” rights for victims protects\nvictims during a criminal investigation. As this Article has explained,\ninterpreting the CVRA to cover crime victims during the pre-charging\nphase of a case is consistent with the statute’s purposes, text, legislative\nhistory, and interpretive case law. And state criminal justice systems also\nappear to be moving in that direction.\n\nThe Justice Department’s contrary interpretation seems unlikely to\nprevail when challenged. The CVRA signals a paradigm shift in the way\nthat crime victims are to be treated, at least within the federal criminal\njustice system. Before enactment of the law, federal investigators and\nprosecutors might have been able to keep victims at arm’s length, refusing\nto confer with them about the case and otherwise ignoring or even\nmistreating them during the process. But those days are over. The CVRA\npromises victims that they now have the right to confer with prosecutors\nand the right to be treated fairly while their cases are investigated. It is time\nfor the Department of Justice to recognize and embrace that new reality.\n\n°55 See Jeffrey A. Pamess et al., Monetary Recoveries for State Crime Victims, 58 CLEV.\n\nSt. L. REv. 819, 850 (2010); Tobolowsky, supra note 221, at 59 (describing a “significant\nexpansion of victim rights to be consulted by the prosecutor and heard by the court”).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014082",
