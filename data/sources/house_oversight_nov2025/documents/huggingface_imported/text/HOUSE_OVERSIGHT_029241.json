  "text": "video in schools as | proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where |\ncould also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their\ncharacter criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe\nBiden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the\nplatform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building\nliteracy and character in the schools.\n\nIt really means a lot to me, ail financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking\nabout me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it’s always annoying but | always learn.\n\nWith abundant gratitude,\nLisa\n\nElisa New\n\nPowell M.
