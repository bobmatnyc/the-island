If they had, they would have discovered that\nhe had no independent basis for his assertion. When asked about it\nduring the Q&A following his July 12 press conference in Moscow,\nhe indeed said that the only knowledge he had about the suspen-\nsion of his passport was what he had “read” in the news reports. But\nall the news stories prior to his statement reported that his pass-\nport had been revoked on June 22, while he was still in Hong Kong.\nABC News, for example, reported that the U.S. “Consul General—\nHong Kong confirmed Hong Kong authorities were notified that Mr.\nSnowden’s passport was revoked June 22.” By advancing that date\nto when his plane was in “midair” on June 23, Snowden provided to\nunsuspecting journalists an untrue alibi for his presence in Russia.\n\nThe credibility problem with Snowden assumed a more sinister\ndimension once he put himself and his fate in the hands of the Rus-\nsian authorities in Moscow. Even though the Obama administration\n\n© decided against revealing the extent of the Russian intelligence ser- ©\nvice’s participation in Snowden’s move from Hong Kong to Mos-\ncow, or what intelligence services call an “exfiltration,” I was told\nby a presidential national security staff adviser that the government\nacted to protect the intelligence sources used by the CIA, the NSA,\nand the FBI to track Snowden’s movements in the latter part of June\nin Hong Kong. The CIA’s deputy director, Morell, would go no fur-\nther than to state that during that period he had no doubt that the\nintelligence services of Russia and China “had an enormous interest\nin him and the information he [Snowden] had stolen.” Presumably,\nthe last thing these adversary services would want would be to make\nthis “interest” transparent to the United States.\n\nThe role of concealment must be taken into account when assess-\ning information bearing on the work of espionage services. When\nI was interviewing James Jesus Angleton—the CIA’s legendary ex-\ncounterintelligence chief, active in the 1970s—for a book on decep-\ntion, I learned that intelligence services play by a different set of\nrules from historians when it comes to their espionage successes.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 131 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019619",
