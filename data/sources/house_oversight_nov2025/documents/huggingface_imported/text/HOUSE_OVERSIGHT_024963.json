The president is now fighting for his\npolitical life and for that of the regime put in place in 1970 by his\nfather, the late President Hafez al-Assad.\n\nForty-one years in power\n\nThe rule of the Assads, father and son, has now lasted 41 years, a\nscore comparable to that of other long-lasting Arab autocrats, each\napparently determined to be a président-a-vie.
