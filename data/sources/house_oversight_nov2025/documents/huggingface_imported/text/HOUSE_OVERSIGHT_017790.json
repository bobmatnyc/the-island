Dershowitz\nAlan M. Dershowitz is a Professor of Law emeritus at Harvard Law School.\n\nDecember 5, 2018\nTo the editor,\n\nThe Crimson story regarding Jeffrey Epstein omitted the central point I made in my interview\nwith the reporter. I welcome an investigation by Harvard or any other institution, including\nprosecutors, into the wilfully false charges made by Virginia Roberts for financial gain. Omitting\nthis crucial statement is irresponsible and unethical journalism.\n\nVirginia Roberts leveled her false accusations four years ago. At the time, I disproved them\ncategorically. The matter was put to rest, with even her lawyers admitting that it was a mistake\nand wrong. Then four years later the Miami Herald recycled this false accusation and The\nCrimson reported on the Herald’s recycled report. I wrote a letter to the editor of the Herald\npointing to the incontrovertible evidence that Roberts made up the accusation out of whole\n\ncloth in order to obtain millions of dollars from Leslie Wexner.\n\nI was able to disprove Roberts’ false accusation by producing all of my travel, AmEx, and TV\nappearance records which showed where I was, and, more importantly, where I wasn’t during\nthe entire period Virginia Roberts was in contact with Jeffrey Epstein. These records prove\nincontrovertibly that I could not have been, and was not, where Roberts’ falsely claimed to have\nmet me — a Caribbean Island, a New Mexico Ranch, a private jet, a Palm Beach mansion —\n\nduring the relevant time period.\n\nI also called for an independent investigation by the former Director of the F.B.I., a highly\nrespected former federal judge and assistant U.S. attorney. He reviewed all of the records and\nother evidence and concluded that “the totality of the evidence ... refutes the allegations.”\n\nhttns:/Awww thecrimson com/article/2018/12/5/letter-dershowit7-misrenresention/ 1/9\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017790",
