  "text": "Currency still a slight headwind for 1Q results but improving\n\nWe expect FX to remain a y/y headwind for 1Q results; the Euro is down about 6% y/y\nbut up 1% from where it was when most Large-cap internet companies reported 4Q\nresults in late January (~$1.06). The GBP at $1.22 is down slightly (1.4%) over the same\nperiod. Our currency strategist is forecasting the Euro to end 2017 at $1.05 and the\nGBP to end at $1.19. FX pressure will ease after 1Q if rates hold, unless a company has\nhigh exposure to Japan.\n\nTable 5: Percent change y/y\n\nEuro GBP Yen Other*\n4Q15 -12.3% -4.5% -8.1% -14.4%\n1Q16 -2.0% -5.4% 1.1% -11.0%\n2Q16 2.0% -4,9% 9.4% -6.3%\n3Q16 0.3% -13.9% 19.3% -2.9%\n4Q16 -1.5% -17.4% 15.1% 0.0%\n1Q17 -3.5% -14.5% 2.5% 3.3%\n2Q17E -5.6% -15.4% -3.9% -0.3%\n3Q17E -4.5% -9,.2% -9.9% -0.9%\n4Q17E -1.2% -3.5% -8.1% 0.2%\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\n\nInternational revenues a percent of total revenues is highest at PCLN (87% of gross\nprofit), GOOG (53%), FB (53%), TRIP (43%), EBAY (57%), and EXPE (42%).
