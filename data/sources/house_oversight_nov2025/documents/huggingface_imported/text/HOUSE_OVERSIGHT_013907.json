This was a new product category that I created to eliminate and preempt the competition. Strive to\nbe the largest, best, or first in a precise category. I prefer being first.\n\n27. If you decide to resell someone else’s higher-end products like Doug, especially with drop-\nshipping, the risk is lower and smaller margins can suffice.\n\n28. “Back-end” products are products sold to customers once the sale of a primary product has been\nmade. iPod covers and car GPS systems are two examples. These products can have lower margins,\nbecause there is no advertising cost to acquire the customer.\n\n29. “Cross-selling” is selling a related product to a customer while they’re still on the phone or in an\nonline shopping cart after the sale of a primary product has been made. For a full marketing and direct\n\nresponse (DR) glossary, visit www.fourhourblog.com.\n30. This also refers to owners of copyrights or trademarks.\n\n31. Said casually and with confidence, this alone will get you through surprisingly often. “I'd like to\nspeak with Mr./Ms. X, please” is a dead giveaway that you don’t know them. If you want to up the\nchances of getting though but risk looking foolish if they call the bluff, ask for the target mentor by\nfirst name only.\n\n32. I use this type of lead-in whenever making off-the-wall requests. It softens it and makes the\nperson curious enough to listen before spitting out an automatic “no.”\n\n33. This answers the questions they’ll have in their head: “Who are you and why are you calling\nnow?” I like to be a “first-time” something to play the sympathy card, and I find a recent media\nfeature online to cite as the trigger for calling.\n\n34. I call people ?'m familiar with. If you can’t call yourself a longtime fan, tell them that you have\nfollowed the mentor’s career or business exploits for a certain number of years.\n\n35. Don’t pretend to be strong. Make it clear you’re nervous and they’ll lower their guard. I often do\nthis even if I’m not nervous.\n\n36. The wording here is critical. Ask them to “help” you do something.\n\n37. Just rework the gatekeeper paragraph for this, and don’t dillydally— get to the point quickly and\nask for permission to pull the trigger.\n\n38. End the conversation by opening the door for future contact. Start with e-mail and let the\nmentoring relationship develop from there.\n\n10)\n\nIncome Autopilot I\n\n= TESTING THE MUSE\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013907",
