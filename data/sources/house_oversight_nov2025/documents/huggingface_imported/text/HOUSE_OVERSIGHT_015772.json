  "text": "82 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nYasser Arafat and Shimon Pérez\n\ntogether. This lifeblood of our existence — long-distance communication\nbetween human beings — turns out to be amazingly difficult, even with\nall our clever technology.\n\nIn recent years the Internet has, in theory, allowed each and every\nperson to communicate freely with any other person on the planet.\nIn some of the most distant parts of the world mobile phones, and\nprojects such as; ‘One Laptop per Child’ are rapidly bringing unlimited\ncommunication to all. This communication can be personal, one-to-one,\nor broadcast: I can talk to people interested in a particular topic directly.\nAs we watch the Arab world democratize, catalyzed by the Internet, there\nis no question that digital communication has now become a major force\nin the world. Yet, people don’t communicate over the Internet as much\nas you would expect; they often use the Internet to set up phone calls\nduring which they arrange meetings! This is odd. We have a fantastic\nphone system and sophisticated communication technologies; email,\nvideo and instant messaging. Yet, we still choose to travel when we want\nto communicate.\n\nOn the face of it, there should be no difference between a phone\ncall and a meeting. In principle the same information can be conveyed.\nYet when we want to really understand someone, we always go to meet\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015772",
