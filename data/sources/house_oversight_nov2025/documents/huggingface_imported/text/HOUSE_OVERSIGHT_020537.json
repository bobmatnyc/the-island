  "text": "78\n\n¢ The US government should not unilaterally grant Chinese think-tank or university\nscholars ten-year visas, as it has been doing, without exacting across-the-board\nreciprocal treatment for US think-tank and university scholars. At the same time,\nthe US government should also advocate consistently on behalf of US think-tank\nand university scholars who have been barred from visiting China.\n\nTwo core values cut across all of our concerns: freedom of speech and reciprocity. As a\ndemocratic society, we should tolerate no infringements—overt or covert—on our\nfreedom of speech and freedom of analysis concerning China. A “leveling of the\nplaying field” in terms of upholding the principles and practicalities of reciprocity in\nour exchanges with Chinese counterparts is needed, because it is an essential part of\nmaking the relationship both more equitable and reciprocal and more stable and thus\ndurable.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 These include: the American Enterprise Institute, Asia Society, Carnegie Endowment for International\nPeace, Brookings Institute, Center for American Progress, Center for Strategic and International Studies,\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, International Peace Institute, Institute for China-American Studies, Kissinger\nInstitute on China and the United States, and Stimson Center.\n\nThink Tanks\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020537",
