  "text": "From: Michael Wolff \nSent: 2/15/2017 1:16:03 PM \nTo: Jeffrey Epstein [jeevacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: A few favors... \nImportance: High \nSo...I'm doing this Trump book for a pile of money and with so far quite a bit of cooperation from them (DT \ncalled me the other day and spent 45 minutes on the phone ranting and raving about the media--alarming). I \nwonder if you could introduce me to Tom Barrack--just to say I'm a journalist who you know and trust, and that \nI'll follow up with a description of the project that I'm doing. Also, I'd love a reintroduction to Kathy Ruemmler. \nI need some off-the-record perspective on White House procedures. \nAre you in NYC soon? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032471",
