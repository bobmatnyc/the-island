  "text": "At the beginning of the chapter, I said Garry Kasparov was once\nthought to be one of the most intelligent people on the planet. When\nhis IQ was eventually tested — the German magazine Der Spiegel put up\nthe money — he scored 135. That means, in academic terms, he is smart\nbut no genius. Yet, he is undoubtedly a genius by any common sense\ndefinition: the best chess player to ever live. These days he involves himself\nin politics rather than chess and is still uniquely able to concentrate for\nlong periods of time. Concentration seems a very important factor.\nEinstein was once asked where his genius came from. He replied that\nhe did not consider himself a genius but instead put his success down to\nhis persistence and ability to concentrate on a problem for many years.\n\n1Q tests say nothing of our ability to concentrate over extended periods\nand nothing about our drive to change the world. The tests are, at best,\na useful but dangerous diagnostic tool for educators. One of the worst\nthings IQ can do is pigeonhole people. Would Kasparov have become\nworld champion if he had been given his IQ score of 135 as a teenager\nrather than late in his thirties after he had conquered the world?\n\ni\n\nHole-in-the-Wall Experiment\n\n“Education is what is left after\nwhat has been learnt has been\nforgotten.”\n\nB.F. Skinner\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015724",
