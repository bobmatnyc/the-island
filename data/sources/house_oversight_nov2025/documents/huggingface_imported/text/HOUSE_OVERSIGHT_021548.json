At least one woman\nhas sued him in New York,\nwhere he owns a_51,000-\nsquare-foot Manhattan man-\nsion.\n\n“Its validation of what\nwe're saying in the civil\ncases,” said Miami attorney\nJeffrey Herman,- who repre-\nsents the alleged victims in\nthe federal lawsuits. West\nPalm Beach attorney Ted\nLeopold represents one al-\nleged victim in a civil suit in\nstate court. He said he antici-\npates amending that lawsuit\nto add “a few other clients”\nas well.\n\nIn the criminal case, po-\nlice went so far as to scour\nEpstein’s trash and conduct\nsurveillance at Palm Beach\n\nternational Airport, where\nthey watched for his private\njet so they would know when\nhe was in town. They con-\ncluded that Epstein paid girls\n$200 to $300' each after the\nmassage sessions.\n\n‘Im like a Heidi Fleiss,”\nHaley Robson, now 22, told\n\npue ediAles aul police about her efforts in\n(AB0jouyoe} se8-a4-U) recruiting girls for Epstein.\n\nABojouyos)\nsiqelene Au to charge Epstein with un-\n\nThere was probable cause\n\nlawful sex acts with.a minor\n\nand lewd and lascivious mo-\nlestation, police concluded.\n\nThe state attorney's of.\nfice said questions about\nthe girls’ credibility led it to\ntake the unprecedented step\nof presenting the evidence\nagainst Epstein to a grand\njury, rather than directly\ncharging him.\n\nPalm Beach Police Chief -\nMichael Reiter was furious\nwith State Attorney Barry\nKrischer, saying in a May\n2006 letter that the prosecu-\ntor should disqualify himself.\n“I continue to find your\noffice’s treatment of these\ncases highly unusual,” he\n\nwrote. He then asked for and\n\ngot a federal investigation.\n\nEpstein hired a phalanx of\nhigh-priced lawyers— includ-\ning Harvard law professor\nand author Alan Dershowitz\n— and public relations people\nwho questioned Reiter’s com-\npetence and the victims’\ntruthfulness.\n\nIn addition to mansions\nin Palm Beach arid Manhat-\ntan, Epstein owns homes in\nNew Mexico and the Virgin\nIslands. He’s a frequent con-\ntributor to Democratic Party\ncandidates. He also donated\n$30 million to Harvard in\n2003.\n\nFormer New York Gov.\nEliot Spitzer returned a\n$50,000 campaign contribu-\ntion from Epstein after his\nindictment, then resigned\nthis year during his own sex\nscandal.
