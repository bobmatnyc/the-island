  "text": "Connecting and Binding Social Brains\nand Minds\n\nWe evolved as social organisms\nin the context of face-to-face interaction.\nMuch of our human biology was\nestablished before the technology of\nemail and cell phones. As a result, our\nbiological nature is tuned primarily to\nsocial signals and interaction that occurs\nin the presence of another. It takes just\na moment of observation for us to know\na lot about another person as a social\nbeing. We can understand other\nspeakers easily within tens of\nmilliseconds of experience. Our brains\nhave developed to make this kind of\nsocial connection quickly and easily,\nwhether through language or action. In\norder to understand someone else, we\nneed to be able to understand their goals\nand intentions. Moreover we need to\nrelate their behavior to our own\nindividual and personal experience.\nSteve Small discusses some of the brain\nmachinery that may allow us to translate\nour perception of language and\nobservation of behavior into a form that\ncan be related to our own use of\nlanguage and action. This kind of\nresonance with experience, rather than\nelaborate inferences, may allow us to\nconnect quickly with others, satisfying\nour drive for sociality.\n\nBut understanding behavior and\ncommunication is not all there is to\nforming social connections. It is one\nthing to read intentions and another to\nfeel someone’s pain. If we only could\nunderstand action and communication,\nan important element of human\nconnection would be missing. In\n\nforming a collective mind, as Giin Semin\n\ndiscusses it, we need to have collective\nemotional responses. Jean Decety\ndiscusses the foundations of empathy\n\nPage | 84\n\nand the brain machinery that supports\nthis important capacity by providing a\nresonant response to the observation of\nanother person’s distress. Although\nsympathy may motivate helping others,\nempathy may be one of the social glues\nthat binds us together as a collective\nsocial organism.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021330",
