  "text": "deep reach. The hypothalamus plays a\nkey role in enabling communication\nfrom brain to periphery. Located in the\nlower central region of the brain, the\nhypothalamus receives neural input on\nbrain and body states (e.g., pain,\nsadness, fear, hunger) and in response\nsignals brain regions that control the\nautonomic nervous system and the\npituitary and adrenal glands. Signals to\nthe autonomic nervous system permit\nmodulation of heart rate, blood pressure,\nand numerous other factors that serve to\nmaintain homeostasis. Signals to the\npituitary gland (located at the base of the\nbrain, just below the hypothalamus)\nprompt the release of hormones that\nultimately permit modulation of almost\nevery endocrine gland in the body,\nincluding the adrenal glands (one is\nsituated on top of each kidney). The\nadrenal glands serve many functions,\nand one is to produce and secrete\ncortisol. Cortisol is frequently referred to\nas a “stress hormone” because\ncirculating levels increase dramatically\nin response to any stimulus that requires,\nor might require, metabolic resources.\nThus, cortisol increases blood sugar\nlevels, increases blood pressure, and\nreduces immune responses and\ninflammation (hence the use of cortisone\ncream or injections to control\ninflammation of the skin after exposure\nto poison ivy). This complex web of\nphysiological links may seem far\nremoved from feelings of social\nisolation, but loneliness has repeatedly\nbeen observed to be a risk factor for\nelevated levels of cortisol, especially in\nthe morning. For instance, in middle-\naged adults, the more intense the degree\nof loneliness reported at day’s end over\nthe course of three days in everyday life,\nthe higher the spike in cortisol the\nsubsequent morning. The conundrum is\n\nPage |44\n\nthat loneliness is associated with\nincreased risk of chronic conditions that\nare characterized by heightened\ninflammation (e.g., atherosclerosis,\nelevated cholesterol levels, heart disease,\ndiabetes, and even cognitive\nimpairment). If cortisol dampens\ninflammation, why might elevated levels\nof cortisol in lonely individuals be\nassociated with more rather than less\ninflammation?\n\nIt turns out that communication\namong the hypothalamus, pituitary\ngland, and adrenal glands becomes\ndysregulated when chronically\nstimulated. Whereas cortisol effectively\ndampens immune and inflammatory\nresponses on an acute basis, when\ncirculating cortisol levels are chronically\nelevated, cells become resistant to its\nimmunosuppressant and anti-\ninflammatory effects. This alteration\nhappens at the level of DNA where the\nactions of genes in each cell of our body\ncan be turned on (i.¢., expressed) or off.\nRecent evidence suggests that the effects\nof loneliness reach down to this level.\nCirculating leukocytes (white blood\ncells) from a small group of chronically\nlonely adults showed decreased\nexpression of glucocorticoid response\ngenes relative to expression rates in a\nmatched group of socially connected\nadults. These genes are important\nbecause they activate the production of\nproteins that “hear” the anti-\ninflammatory signal sent by cortisol.\nThus, despite higher levels of circulating\ncortisol in the lonely group, the cortisol\nsignal may still not be heard. The lonely\ngroup also showed increased expression\nof genes carrying pro-inflammatory\nelements which, together with reduced\nexpression of glucocorticoid response\ngenes, provides a functional genomic\nexplanation for elevated risk of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021290",
