  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nWhile these premeditated and carefully organized killing sprees were taking place, the United\nNations fiddled on about the imperfections of the United States, Israel and other western\ndemocracies. The real victims of this inversion have not been the western democracies that have\nbeen the focus of the U.N. condemnations. The real victims have been those willfully ignored by\nthe U.N., which has used its focus on Israel and other democracies as an excuse—a cover—for its\nmalignant inaction against horrible human wrongs committed by the tyrannical regimes that\ncontrol much of the UN agenda and give themselves exculpatory immunity from any UN\ncondemnations or intervention. “Never again” has been turned into “again and again and again.”\nThe label of “human rights” has been used to promote human wrongs. Our heroes—Eleanor\nRoosevelt, Rene Cassin, Albert Schweitzer—should be turning over in their graves, as the shields\nthey constructed to protect the helpless from oppression and genocide have been beaten into\nswords to be used by the oppressors and genocidal killers.\n\nI refuse to allow these human rights pretenders to hijack and invert the honorable agenda of\nneutral and universal human rights. I will keep struggling until my dying day to return human\nrights to its proper place in the international community.\n\n343\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017430",
