A British citizen, he was raised in Dubai and studied economics in\nLondon.\n\nArticle 3.\n\nThe Economist\n\nIndia's next prime minister: The Modi era\nbegins\n\nMay 18th 2014 -- IN THE days since May 16th when Narendra Modi and\nhis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stormed to victory in India’s general\nelection much commentary has wrestled with the idea of history. Most\ncommentators seem to agree that May 2014 marks an historic moment.\nOne reason is the scale of Mr Modi’s landslide victory, which scooped up\n282 seats for the BJP and thus an absolute majority in parliament. That is\nfirst time since 1984 that any party has won a majority for itself. It is also\nthe first time ever that a party other than Congress has done so.\nConversely, the defeat for Congress is far worse than anything in its long\nhistory of dominating Indian politics: it won fewer than a sixth the seats of\nits rival, getting just 44. In much of north India, the political heartland,\nCongress was wiped out. Some correctly ask if its eventual recovery\n(assuming that will happen one day) would require being rid of the Nehru-\nGandhi dynasty that has been at its heart for so long.\n\nYet the size of Mr Modi’s victory, and Congress’s defeat, tells only part of\nthe dramatic story. The immense dissatisfaction with Congress was\nundeniable. Voters were unhappy with high inflation, slowing growth,\nweak leadership, corruption and much more. Such voter grumpiness,\nusually summed up as “anti-incumbency’”, is all but inevitable for a party\nthat had been in power for a decade. Yet more has happened here. Take,\nfor example, the utter defeat of the Bahujan Samaj Party of Mayawati, the\nDalit leader in Uttar Pradesh. She was not an incumbent and her party\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031575",
