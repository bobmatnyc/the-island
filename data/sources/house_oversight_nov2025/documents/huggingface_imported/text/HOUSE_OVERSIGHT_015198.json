  "text": "comedians do have something in common. We both like to have a good\nopening line. As a performer, | always try to slant my opening line toward a\nparticular audience.\n\nMy opening line at the World Hemp Expo was, “Last night, for the\nfirst time in my life, | used a hemp condom.” My opening line at a\nSkeptics Conference, attended by the Amazing Randi and the Amazing\nKreskin, was: “The is the first conference |’ ve been to where there were\ntwo people with the same first name of Amazing—but the Amazing Randi\nwas born with that name, it’ s on his birth certificate, whereas the\nAmazing Kreskin changed his name for showbiz--his real name is the\nObnoxious Kreskin.”. And my opening line at a luncheon during the Los\nAngeles County Bar Association conference was, “I’ d like to begin with a\nmoment of silence, so that you can think about your client’ s problem,\nand then you can make this a billable hour.”\n\nNow | find myself in a lavish hotel suite, trying to crystallize an\nopening line while contemplating the bald spot on the back of my head,\ninfinitely cloned in the mirrors of the hotel-room bathroom, actually the\nonly place | ever get to see that bald spot as others do. This will be a\nserious opening line, since | have been told that, in the introduction to my\n\nperformance, | will be presented with the Lifestyles Freedom Award. |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015198",
