  "text": "people who do have the Seventh Sense. Even, | think, by people who are reading this\nbook.\n\nWhy start this journey into the churning, still-confusing and affronting world\naround us now by the shores of Lake Taihu? Why begin with the sentiments of a\nslower culture that Master Nan embodied, passed like delicate and still-warm tea,\nwith so much calm in the face of all this urgency? It’s not only because of Master\nNan’s insight that this world is tearing at our minds, that the faster we move the\nsicker we'll get. It’s something else. The training of an instinct, of a really fresh way\nof looking at the world, demands a kind of calm. Understanding of anything, after all,\nis most durably assembled in slow conversations, in patient probing. It is developed\nas much from brushes with music and literature as it is from any direct, slamming\nconfrontation with the truth. The birth of an instinct requires a rewiring of our\nminds, a reframing of our hopes, and this can only be done at the pace of\ncontemplation. (It’s the best way to keep the fear at bay.) We seek those stilled,\nfreeze-framed moments where we'll pause amid lightspeed fast networks to think\nabout why they work and just what they are doing to us. Tranquility, fora moment\nat least, in the face of the alternately horrible and wonderful way the world is being\nremade. That’s what you'll get here, in the following pages. Nan’s model statesman\nSu Qin, knife stabbed into his own thigh and slouched with exhaustion is a sort of\ntotem for us. Knife in thigh. Stop. Think. Even, hard as it may be, wait for the right\npath to present itself. No matter how uncomfortable it may be at times, it is better to\nbe unconventional than conventional in our revolutionary age. This is the only way\nto cultivate a Seventh Sense. The old methods will not teach you a new way.\n\nLet me tell you what is going to happen: In coming years there will be a struggle\nbetween those who have the Seventh Sense - who are born with it or trained to it -\nand those who don't. New, network forces all around us will take on old, established\nones - they already are - in business, politics, warfare, science. Then - because\nthose who don’t have the Seventh Sense for network power will lose, as anyone who\ntries to stop the future always loses - a new age will begin. This age will involve\nviolent, historic wrestling between different groups with different versions of the\nSeventh Sense.Competing interests and ideals and aims will fire these contending\nforces. Networks will fight networks. Some of the plans of these connected age\ngroups will be good, others evil, and anyhow the winners will be ruthless. Then, and\nthis is where it will get particularly strange and incredible, there will be a battle\nbetween those with the Seventh Sense and the very systems of connection,\nmachines and intelligence they have built. Human instincts laid in competition\nagainst the machine instincts. That struggle? I’m not quite sure how it will turn out.\nBut for now, at least, we can say this: The future sits almost like a cold-eyed dare in\nfront of us. Just try to avoid this!\n\n17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018249",
