A moral argument can be made that\nmonsters like Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and Kim Jong-il in\nNorth Korea should be overthrown any way they can, as fast as we\ncan, regardless of the risk of short-term chaos. But that reasoning\nquickly loses its appeal when one is dealing with dictators who are\nless noxious. And even when they are not less noxious, as in the case\nof Iraq’s Saddam Hussein, the moral argument for their removal is\nstill fraught with difficulty since the worse the autocrat, the worse the\nchaos left in his wake. That is because a bad dictator eviscerates\nintermediary institutions between the regime at the top and the\nextended family or tribe at the bottom—professional associations,\ncommunity organizations, political groups and so on—the very stuff\nof civil society. The good dictator, by fostering economic growth,\namong other things, makes society more complex, leading to more\ncivic groupings and to political divisions based on economic interest\nthat are by definition more benign than tribal, ethnic or sectarian\ndivides. A good dictator can be defined as one who makes his own\nremoval less rife with risk. While the logical conclusion of Mill’s\nessay 1s to deny the moral right of dictatorship, his admission of the\nneed for obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne at primitive levels\nof social development leaves one facing the larger question: Is\ntransition from autocracy to democracy always virtuous? For there is\na vast difference between the rule of even a wise and enlightened\nindividual like the late-sixteenth-century Mogul Akbar the Great and\na society so free that coercion of the individual by the state only ever\noccurs to prevent the harm of others. It is such a great disparity that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032195",
