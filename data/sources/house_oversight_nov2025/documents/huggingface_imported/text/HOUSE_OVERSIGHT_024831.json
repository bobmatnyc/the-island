The figure shows the\nincrease in planted acres in 2018 (Sept) as well as the shift toward CBD as a percentage\nof total hemp (planted acres for CBD rising to 4,121 acres in 2018 from 864 in 2017). In\n2018, there were 158 greenhouses in Kentucky representing 764,000 sq. ft., which is\nincluded in the 2018 acreage below. (Note 1 acre = 43,560 sq. ft.)\n\nOn January 22, 2019, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture approved 1,035\napplications to cultivate up to 42,086 acres of industrial hemp in 2019, up from 16,100\nacres in 2018 and 33 acres in 2014, which was the first growing year. (67 acres of\ngreenhouse space was also approved for hemp cultivation.) We note that of the 16,100\nacres approved in 2018, less than half (6,700) was planted.\n\nFigure 7 - Kentucky Department of Agriculture Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program\n\nApproved | Approved | Approved Planted | Harvested | % of Grain % CBD & % Grain &\nProduction Year | Processors | Growers Acres Acres Acres or Seeds % Fiber % CBD Grain Fiber\n- 33 -\n\n2018 (Sept)\n2019\n\nSource: kyagr.com/hemp, Cowen and Company\n\nOutlook For Growth\n\nThe expected growth for hemp is supported by the economics offered. However, there\nare limitations related to required cultivation methods.\n\nConversations with industry experts estimate planted hemp acres in 2019 could reach\n200,000, up from 78,176 in 2018. The growth is supported by expansion like Kentucky's\nand new states entering the market (only 23 states participated in 2018).\n\nCOWEN.COM 45\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024831",
