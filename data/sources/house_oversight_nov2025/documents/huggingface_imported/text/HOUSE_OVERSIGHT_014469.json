  "text": "Europe’s ERP on our model is 6.9% — down from the post-Brexit highs at 7.5% but still\nat a 70bp premium to the 3 and 5 year average for the ERP. That in turn implies a ~11%\nvaluation haircut relative to 5-year average levels.\n\nThese numbers also show that the recent rise in bond yields is modest relative to where\ncost of equity or ERP sits. We're quite far away from the level that bond yields would\nmake ERP look expensive. Even with bund yields at 75bp (ie +50bp from here) it would\nonly shift the ERP back to average levels (all else equal). Bond yields need to rise 150-\n200bp to get to the expensive end of the range of last 6 years on ERP.\n\nChart 21: Implied cost of equity (CoE) on our model in Europe is 6.9%, a Chart 22: Implied equity risk premium remains elevated: 6.7% ERP to\nlittle below the average since 1988 (7.2%) and last 10 years (8.4%). bund yields vs 10-year average of 6.2% and recent high of 7.3%.\n16 12\n14\n10\n12\n8\n10\n8 6\n6 4\n4 —— Equity Risk Premium (vs 10y Bund)\n5 —— Implied cost of equity (%) 2\n0\n01/88 01/91 01/94 01/97 01/00 01/03 01/06 01/09 01/2 01/15 10/06 09/08 08/10 08/12 07/4 06/16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, MSCI, IBES Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, MSCl, IBES\n\nEurope cost of equity higher than long-run average compared to US. Europe also\ncompares favourably on a relative basis against the US equity market in this framework.\nThe implied CoE for the S&P500 on an equivalent model is 5.64%, which is now at an\n11-year low and 130bp below the 10-year average. The implied ERP on that basis at\n3.3% is also below average and not far off the lows from the past 10 years. Admittedly\nEurope did get significantly cheaper relative to the US during the GFC and the sovereign\ndebt crisis. The cost of equity premium for MSCI Europe vs the S&P is 1.21%. That is a\npremium to the 30-year average of 0.72%. However it is below the average of the past\n10 years — the spread peaked at over 4% in 2008 and at 2.7% in 2011 / 2012.\n\nChart 23: Implied equity risk premium near 9-year lows in the US Chart 24: Europe vs US implied cost of equity spread\n\n—— Cost of equity spread Europe vs S&P\n\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n=——=S8P Equity Risk Premium (vs 10y UST)\n\n0 -2\n\n10/06 09/08 08/10 08/12 07/14 06/16 01/90 01/93 01/96 01/99 01/02 01/05 01/08 01/11 01/14\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, MSCI, IBES Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, MSCl, IBES\n10 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 Bankof America 2\n\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014469",
