Revisiting the issue in 2013, the CBO showed that after-tax average income soared 15.1% for the top 1% from\n2009 to 2010--but grew by less than 1% for the bottom 90% over the same time period, and fell for many income\ngroups (5). Additionally, although the Census Bureau estimates that real mean household income increased 0.2% in\n\n2011 and 2012, it declined for all groups other than those in the top fifth of earners (6).\n\nThis concentration of household income follows a long period in which income concentration remained relatively flat.\nUsing U.S. tax returns, economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez found that income concentration dropped\ndramatically following both World Wars and was roughly unchanged for the next few decades (7). It started climbing\nagain in 1975, reaching pre-World War I levels by 2000--and Saez later observed that U.S. income inequality has now\nreached levels not seen since 1928 (8). In both cases, a similar pattern was in evidence--a boom in the financial sector,\nover-leveraged lower-income households, a massive, systemic financial crash--and the two worst economic slumps in\n\nUS. history, the Great Depression and Great Recession, followed.\n\nWWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT AUGUST 5, 2014 5\n\n1351366 | 302136118\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025767",
