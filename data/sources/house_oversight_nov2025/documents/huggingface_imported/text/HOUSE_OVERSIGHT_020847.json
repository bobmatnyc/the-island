  "text": "...And What You Won't\n\nWe do not make policy recommendations. We try to help clarify some of the\nissues in a simple, analytically-based way. We aim to present data, trends, and\nfacts about USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers to provide context for\nhow its financials have reached their present state.\n\nWe did not base this analysis on proprietary data. Our observations come\nfrom publicly available information, and we use the tools of basic financial\nanalysis to interpret it. Forecasts generally come from 3rd-party agencies like the\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO). For US policy makers, the timing of material\nchanges will be especially difficult, given the current economic environment.\n\nNo doubt, there will be compliments and criticism of things in the\npresentation (or missing from it). We hope that this report helps advance the\ndiscussion and we welcome others to opine with views (backed up by data).\n\nKP\ni USA Inc. | Introduction 11\n\nWe Focus on Federal,\n\nNot State & Local Government Data\n\ne Federal / State & Local Governments Share Different Responsibilities\n\n— Federal government is financially responsible for all or the majority of Defense, Social\nSecurity, Medicare and Interest Payments on federal debt and coordinates / shares\nfunding for public investment in education / infrastructure.\n\n— State & local governments are financially responsible for all or the majority of Education,\nTransportation (Road Construction & Maintenance), Public Safety (Police / Fire\nProtection / Law Courts / Prisons) and Environment & Housing (Parks & Recreation /\nCommunity Development / Sewerage & Waste Management).\n\n— Federal / state & local governments share financial responsibility in Medicaid and\nUnemployment Insurance.\n\ne We Focus on the Federal Government\n\n— State and local governments face many similar long-term financial challenges and may\nultimately require federal assistance. To be sure, the size of state & local government\nbudget deficits ($70 billion’ in aggregate in F2009) and debt-to-GDP ratio (7%? on\naverage in F2008) pales by comparison to the federal government's ($1.3 trillion budget\ndeficit, 62% debt-to-GDP ratio in F2010). But these metrics may understate state & local\ngovernments’ financial challenges by 50% or more® because they exclude the long-term\ncost of public pension and other post employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities.\n\nNote: 1) Per National Conference of State Legislatures, State fiscal years ends in June. $70B aggregate excludes deficits\n\nfrom Puerto Rico ($3B deficits in F2009). 2) Debt-to-GDP ratio per Census Bureau State & Local Government Finance; 3)\n\nCalculation based on the claim that $1T of collective short fall in State & local government pension and OPEB funding\n\nKP would be $2.5T using corporate accounting rules, per Orin S. Kramer, “How to Cheat a Retirement Fund,” 9/10.\n(@E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | Introduction 12\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020847",
