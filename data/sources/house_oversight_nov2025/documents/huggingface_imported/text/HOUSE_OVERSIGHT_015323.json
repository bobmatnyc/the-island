  "text": "Meanwhile, the memorabilia business flourishes as millions of voters\nseek a variety of tangible items to remind them of the part they played in\nhistory simply by voting. Mouse pads, baby bibs, aprons, dog jerseys,\nbobble-heads, niche buttons ( “Ventriloquists for Obama” ), T-shirts (\n\n“Now | Don’ t Have to Move to Canada” ) and, as reported by NPR,\nObama condoms. Somebody bid $400 on eBay for the November 5th issue\nof the New York Times. USA Today printed 500,000 extra copies; the\nWashington Post printed 350,000 extras. The only thing | saved was a full-\npage ad by the 99 Cents Only stores, which included a “Joe the Plumber\n\nSpecial” plunger. There was no limit on how many | could buy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015323",
