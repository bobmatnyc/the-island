  "text": "GORDON GETTY ON DONALD TRUMP\n\nCALL TO ACTION\n\nGruterites,\n\nWhat prompted my first memo was a concern that we have a psychopath or sociopath or\nmalignant narcissist or narcissist or Mach (Machiavellian) in the White House, whether or\nnot those categories grade into a continuum. What might be the remedy? To start,\n\nsomeone should get the word out.\n\nIt isn’t about partisanship. The far left, with its ancient forbears such as Marius or\nPeisistratos, has shown equal menace or worse. It’s about fitness for office. The President\nis the world’s number one fiduciary. A fiduciary puts the trust first. Persons without\n\nempathy or remorse are not prudent choices.\n\nBy book, I mean a collection of papers along the lines of “Moral Markets.” A mass-\nmarket book would be even better if one of us is up for it and up to it.\n\nIf I am right in fitting the president somewhere in the groups I listed, the nation faces a\ndifferent and deeper crisis than many had thought. That clarifies the question and its\nurgency. We may or may not reach consensus on the answer. Each of us will decide\nseparately, as always, on what is relevant and where logic leads. The overall theme might\nbe something like “personality disorders in leadership.” There would be attention, but not\n\nexclusive attention, to which shoe if any fits the President.\n\nGORDON GETTY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032735",
