  "text": "compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly coordinated murder \"ops\":\n\n(| write) \"The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through\nsources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to\nparticipate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading\nonly to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you\nsee below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf and\nwhat advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics; and\none also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's to\ncome for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly suspicious\nas noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) “As a former homicide commander, | am\nstunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,” William O. Ritchie, former head of criminal\ninvestigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also raised questions\nabout the marshals’ actions: “How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was\nnot injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did the US Marshal check\nfor petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation? Did the\nUS Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning? My gut tells me\nthere is something fishy going on in Texas.”\n\nAs for SAIC, the following also pertains:\n\n(| write) \"If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase),\nand also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and\nBen Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture:\n\n(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered\ninto joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011\nHillary Clinton State Department award (http://(www.prnewswire.con/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-\na...);\n\n(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon\nthereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion\ndollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...);\n\n(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as\ncorrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... (\"[SAIC and\nTetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (IJSI), has been awarded a\ncontract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of\nState's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to provide\nINL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries emerging\nfrom conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges. Under this new contract, IJSI will provide\ntechnical assistance, training, logistics and infrastructure services to support the Department of\nState's efforts to strengthen criminal justice systems in select partner countries.”)... yet, just months\nshy of contract end, the NY Times reported: \"Tasked With Combating Opium, Afghan Officials Profit\nFrom It;\" \"Penetrating Every Stage of Afghan Opium Chain, Taliban become a Cartel;\" and \"Corrupt\nCombatants Fight for Control of Lucrative Afghan Drug Trade;\" see also here an overview of the\ngrowth of Afghan opium production from the start of the US occupation (2001) to the present, and\nespecially from contract start (2011) to end (2016): http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-spoils-of-war-\nafghanist.../91;\n\n(4) and that the award Bud Horton helped secure just as Sue's contract was coming to an end was\nnot only born from what looks like Franklin Scandal compromises, but it is this contract that seems\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015005",
