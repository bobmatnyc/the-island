But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and\nseveral governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts.\n\nThere are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax,\nUK domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money.\n\nWe have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts\ncontained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include:\n\nHSBC (Suisse) SA\nFAMILY INTEREST L.P.\n22079\n\nBESSIE\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030344",
