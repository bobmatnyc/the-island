  "text": "The paradox of our nation is that we turn our vices into virtues. As\nthe truth about political assassinations—from Malcolm X to Mrs. Dorothy\nHunt—finally begins to emerge, we may truthfully say, “Only in America\ndoes there exist the freedom to reveal how insidious we have been, and\nthen to continue in our insidious way with an even more determined\nspirit.”\n\n| still believe that the United States is the greatest country in the\nworld. It is also the greatest show on earth.\n\n| once had a vision of myself leaving Washington the way Jimmy\nDurante used to end his TV program, standing in a spotlight and bowing\ngracefully to the audience, then walking back a few steps into another\nspotlight, bowing again, and so on. Instead, | ended up sounding as\nhelpless as Hal the Computer in the movie 2007, unable to control my own\nmemory banks.\n\nMy consolation for this personal tragedy is summed up in Jeane\nDixon’ s prediction: “Historians yet unborn are going to take the facts,\nand Richard Nixon will go down as a great President. They’ re going to\nfind that the price the world is paying for trying to discredit Nixon is going\n\nto be that we’ Il practically lose our freedom.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015129",
