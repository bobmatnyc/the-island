  "text": "Intelligence\n\nIthough my computer appears to havea mischievous sense of humor\n\n— deleting files and crashing just before important presentations\n\n— it does not appear to enjoy listening to Bach, nor does it ever\n\nask me to put it near the window to admire the view. I think this means\nit’s not intelligent, but what is ‘intelligence’?\n\nIntelligence is hard to define; I usually conclude someone is\nintelligent if I have an interesting conversation with them. In the\nworkplace we typically hire people based on interview, rather than\npractical tests. Could a computer hold a conversation with me and\npersuade me it is intelligent? Meet Eliza.\n\nInvented by Joseph Weizenbaum of the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology, and named after George Bernard Shaw’s character in\nPygmalion, Eliza runs an algorithm pretending to be a psychiatrist\noffering a sympathetic ear to anyone who cares to talk. Try her out at my\nwebsite or read the sample dialogue below!\n\nUser: Men are all alike.\n\nEliza: In what way?\n\nUSER: Men are all alike.\n\nELIZA: In what way ?\n\nUSER: They’re always bugging us about something or other.\n\nELIZA: Can you think of a specific example ?\n\nUSER: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.\n\nELIZA: Your boyfriend made you come here ?\n\nUSER: He says I’m depressed much of the time.\n\nELIZA: | am sorry to hear that you are depressed.\n\nUSER: It’s true. | am unhappy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015715",
