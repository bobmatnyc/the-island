  "text": "fresh chances for complex and instant chaos. The emergence of surprise, tragedy, of\nwealth and hope will be more common now than in less revolutionary times. To\nfollow the logic of the French philosopher Paul Virilio, fora moment: The train\nproduced the train accident. The plane produced the plane accident'’”. Surely we can\ncount on the network to produce the network accident —- and many of them. In such\na world the question of what you “have” - by which I mean what you are connected\nto - determines what you “are.” You have friends on a social network. The US has a\ncurrency platform. Some new startup has an artificially intelligent machine. We all\nhave possibilities and vulnerabilities we only dimly understand.\n\nThe great insight of the Enlightenment was that the nature of an object - a person, a\npiece of land, a vote, a share - changed when it was liberated from old fetters of\ntradition, ignorance, habit or fear. That single shift triggered centuries of disruption,\nof wars, of creativity and great human advance. The world realigned itself. The\nSeventh Sense era will be similar. When we are connected, power shifts. It changes\nwho we are, what we might expect, how we might be manipulated, attacked,\nenriched. It is too early to map with any real fidelity the landscape that will emerge\nas a result, but we can say at least this: The nature of an object, any object, changes\nwhen it is connected. We need to say too: We are relatively early in our age of\nconnection. It’s not just that so much of the world remains to be linked; it’s also that\nthe nature of connection itself is changing. It is becoming instant. It is increasingly\nsharpened and enhanced, we will see, by the use of artificial intelligence. Basic\nconnection is a powerful force; instant, Al-enabled links? You can imagine it must be\nsomething else entirely.\n\nLet’s take as an example a tool you're using right now, the English language. Any\nlanguage is an “object” of sorts, a tool whose power depends on how and where it is\nused. Just as widespread use of the dollar or the British Pound or gold - for trade,\nfor finance or for stashing under mattresses — marks a network of economic\nexchange, so English is a mesh for information sharing. When Spanish and Lebanese\nand Russian researchers gather to design a drug molecule, when astronauts talk in\nthe International Space Station, when bankers settle finance policy in the midst of\nyet another unexpected crisis, they are using a powerful, standardized, shared tool\nthat makes their work possible and efficient. English in this role, like French before\nit, has an appealing leverage: The more people who use it, the greater the incentive\nto learn it.\n\nBut when we think of English in a network sense, we see it is more than simply an\nobject. It’s a means of connection, something that information scientists calla\n“protocol”. You may know the word from the realm of diplomacy, where protocols\nritualize and decide everything from where the President sits at a dinner to howa\nletter must be addressed. In technical terms a “protocol” is also a rulebook too.\nSome network protocols you may have heard of - HTTP, DNS, SWIFT all serve as\nlinks in this sense. They translate digital bits into organized web pages, secure\n\n17 To follow the logic: Paul Virilio and Philippe Petit. Politics of the Very Worst: An\nInterview by Philippe Petit.
