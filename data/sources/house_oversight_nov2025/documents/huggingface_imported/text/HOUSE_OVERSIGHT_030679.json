I have been coordinating with Richard Kahn (copied), and I have sent \nalong to him the invoice and donation letter.

If you are available to attend the ceremony, please \nlet us know, as well as to provide us with the names of your three guests. (Security is extra tight this year, with \nhonoring Al Gore and all, and everyone's names have to be on the list to attend). \nThanks so much, and look forward hearing more on this. \nBest, \nSteven \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030679 \nSteven Pfeiffer \nAssociate Director, Development \nIndependent Filmmaker Project \nMade in NY Media Center by IFP \n30 John Street  \nBrooklyn, NY 11201  \n13: \nwww.ifp.org \nFrom: Peggy Siegal < \nDate: Thursday, November 16, 2017 at 3:31 PM \nTo: Jeffrey Epstein <*eevacation mail.com>, Steven Pfeiffer <11.=11>, Rich Kahn \n, Joana Vicente \nCc: Rebecca Drescher <M111.1111M1>, Lila Walker__________________________ \nSubject: Re: 2017 IFP Gotham Awards.

As per Peggy Siegal's office, I have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards \nceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. \nThis year's ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn't be more thrilled with this year's impressive \ngroup of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The \nDirector Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the \nIndustry Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn't be more \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030680 \npleased to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year's special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year \nranging from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Bilge, this \nyear's ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions. \nBest regards, \nSteven \nSteven Pfeiffer \nAssociate Director, Development \nIndependent Filmmaker Project \nMade in NY Media Center by IFP \n30 John Street  \nBrooklyn, NY 11201  \np: \nwww.ifp.org  \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
