  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nThe case of the questionable antiques\n\nMy brother Nathan and I were retained to appeal the conviction of a Persian antiquities seller,\nwho was charged with arranging the theft of his own antiquities. The story, which became a lead\narticle in The New Yorker magazine, involved a man whose father had been the director of\nantiquities for the Shaw of Iran. When the Shaw fell, the son took the family’s antiquities and\nopened a shop in London. The Metropolitan Museum in New York wanted to exhibit the\nantiquities, since the owner said they were pre-Mohammaden and therefore very valuable. The\nowner had an expert examine and certify them as pre-Mohammaden and they were then shipped\nto the museum. When they arrived in New York, they were stolen. The District Attorney charged\nour client with arranging for their theft, because, as the DA alleged, they were not really pre-\nMohammaden and therefore considerably less valuable. The motive was to collect insurance\nbased on the artificially-high British evaluation. When the client asked us to do his appeal, he\noffered to pay us in pre-Mohammaden antiquities. I responded, “Would you really want a lawyer\nwho was foolish enough to accept pre-Mohammaden antiquities from a man charged with falsely\ndating them?” We agreed on a retainer and we won the case. Not only was the client totally\nreprieved but he even got his antiquities back. Shortly thereafter, he sent me a bonus for winning.\nSure enough, it was an antiquity. I hope it’s real.\n\n385\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017472",
