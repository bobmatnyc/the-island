  "text": "CNN\n\nHOST: Absolutely, well certainly but breaking precedent by\nnot having a young leader coming up behind him and we\ndiscussed this yesterday. The transfer of Mr. Xi will remain\nin power for many more years to come, perhaps revive the\nposition of party chairman and stick around indefinitely.\n\nRLK: There’s no question about the power and longevity of\nXi. I would put it a little differently. I’d say that it is not\neven necessary for him to have the party chairmanship or\nany particular title because of his overarching power by\nhaving his name associated with “Xi Jinping Thought on\nSocialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” - that\nwhole phrase is now in the Party Constitution. Moreover, he\nalready had the designation of “Core” of the Party.\n\nNO HEIR APPARENT TO CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING OW\n\nRLK: So those two elements - name in Constitution and\nCore - are totally overarching over any particular title. That\nsaid, not having a younger member of the Standing\nCommittee who is an obvious candidate for future\nleadership, prevents there being a separate power center\nthat could undermine what Xi wants to do. So the fact that\nXi will be there until, potentially, the mid-2030s is very real.\nI think now we should shift our attention to what Xi Jinping\nwants to do. We need to look at the policies he is putting\nforth, and see what they mean for China and for the world.\n\nHOST: And I want to touch on that in a moment, but given\nthis power and position afforded to him in the constitution\nno less, I mean where is room for discussion?\n\nWednesday\n\nHO\n\nCHINA'S NEW POWER PLAYERS\n\n7\n\nCHINA'S NEW POWER PLAYERS\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032639",
