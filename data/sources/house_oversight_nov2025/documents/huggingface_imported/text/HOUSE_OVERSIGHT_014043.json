The Task Force then made a series of recommendations for all\ncriminal justice agencies, including the police, prosecutors, and the courts.'!\nThe recommendations were designed to allow crime victims to receive\ninformation about, and to participate in, criminal cases.\n\nIn its most far-reaching recommendation, the Task Force proposed\namending the U.S. Constitution to protect victims’ rights.'7 The proposed\namendment would have built on existing constitutional rights for criminal\ndefendants by extending similar rights to crime victims.'*\n\nAfter the publication of the report, crime victims’ advocates secured\nthe passage of a series of state constitutional and legislative reforms. These\nmeasures guaranteed victims’ rights in the criminal process, such as the\nright to be notified of court proceedings, to attend those proceedings, and to\nspeak at appropriate points in the process, such as plea bargaining and\nsentencing. The measures were embodied in state statutes and, in more\nthan thirty states, state constitutional “bills of rights” for crime victims.'*\nWhile many of the measures had narrow participatory rights,'* some of the\namendments also contained more open-ended language, promising victims\na right to fair treatment “throughout the criminal justice process.”\"°\n\nAfter successfully passing many state constitutional amendments,\ncrime victims’ rights advocates sought to achieve the Task Force’s broadest\nrecommendation: to secure protection for victims’ rights in the U.S.\nConstitution. In 1996, victims’ advocates proposed a Victims’ Rights\nAmendment in a Rose Garden ceremony attended by President Bill\nClinton.'’ The proposed amendment contained a list of rights for crime\nvictims, largely paralleling the nghts contained in state victims’ nights\n\n\" See id. at 56-82.\n\n12 Td. at 114.\n\n13 Id. at 114-15.\n\n'4 For a map depicting the states with (and without) such amendments, see State Victim\nRights Amendments, NATL VICTIMS’ CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PASSAGE,\nhttp://goo.gl/znI4YW (last visited Nov. 26, 2013), for discussion, see infra Part IV.D\n(discussing legislative reforms in a number of states).\n\n15 See, e.g., CAL.
