  "text": "the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism — and I happen to think\nthat the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think\nstrong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors,\nand that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, and\nI think it’s what can see us forward.\n\nYou know, Putin’s been quite an interesting character. He’s also very, very, very intelligent.\nI can see this in the United States where he’s playing very strongly to social conservatives\nabout his message about more traditional values, so I think it’s something that we have to\nbe very much on guard of. Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin and his cronies\nare really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to expand. However,\nI really believe that in this current environment, where you're facing a potential new\ncaliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation — I’m not saying we can put it on\na back burner — but I think we have to deal with first things first.\n\nQuestioner: One of my questions has to do with how the West should be responding to\nradical Islam. How, specifically, should we as the West respond to Jihadism without losing\nour own soul? Because we can win the war and lose ourselves at the same time. How\nshould the West respond to radical Islam and not lose itself in the process?\n\nBannon: From a perspective — this may be a little more militant than others. I think\ndefinitely you’re going to need an aspect that is [unintelligible]. I believe you should take a\nvery, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other\naspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that’s fine.\n\nIf you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I\nbelieve that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think\nthey kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places... It\nbequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West.\n\nAnd I would ask everybody in the audience today, because you really are the movers and\ndrivers and shakers and thought leaders in the Catholic Church today, is to think, when\npeople 500 years from now are going to think about today, think about the actions you’ve\ntaken — and I believe everyone associated with the church and associated with the Judeo-\nChristian West that believes in the underpinnings of that and believes in the precepts of\nthat and want to see that bequeathed to other generations down the road as it was\n\nbequeathed to us, particularly as you're in a city like Rome, and in a place like the Vatican,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029040",
