  "text": "798\n\nRastelli v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,\n79 N.Y.2d 289, 295, 582 N.Y.S.2d 378, 591\nN.E.2d 222 (1992)). Conspiracy “requires\nan agreement to commit a tortious act.”\nId. at 122-23. Aiding and abetting “re-\nquires that the defendant have given sub-\nstantial assistance or encouragement to\nthe primary wrongdoer.” Jd. at 123.\n“[U]nder either theory, the defendant\nmust know the wrongful nature of the\nprimary actor’s conduct.” Jd. (finding no\nconcerted action liability where airline had\nno knowledge mother was removing\ndaughter from country without father’s ap-\nproval).\n\ni. Causation\n\nJudge Robertson found his consideration\nof Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s FSIA\ndefenses did not present an opportunity\nfor a general discourse on causation since\nPlaintiffs’ theory would stretch causation\nto “terra incognita.” Burnett I, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 20. This Court agrees with\nJudge Robertson’s conclusion, but it un-\ndertakes the causation analysis because a\nsimilar review will be necessary in its con-\nsideration of the Defendants’ motions for\nfailure to state a claim. See Part III\nbelow.\n\nPlaintiffs place great reliance on Halber-\nstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C.Cir.1983)\nand Bowm v. Quranic Literacy Institute. &\nHoly Land Foundation for Relief & Devel-\nopment, 291 F.3d 1000, 1028 (7th Cir.2002)\n(“Bowm IT”). Neither of these cases con-\ncern the tortious activity exception to the\nFSIA, but they do explain liability under\n\n28. The court in Halberstam outlined the ele-\nments of aiding and abetting as: “(1) the\nparty whom the defendant aids must perform\na wrongful act that causes an injury; (2) the\ndefendant must be generally aware of his role\nas part of an overall illegal or tortious activity\nat the time that he provides the assistance;\n(3) the defendant must knowingly and sub-\nstantially assist the principal violation.’’ Hal-\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nthe ATA and for aiding and abetting and\nconspiracy.“ In Halberstam, the defen-\ndant was found liable as a joint venturer\nfor a killing that occurred during a burgla-\nry at which she was not present. Halber-\nstam, 705 F.2d at 488; see also Lumbard\nv. Maglia, Inc, 621 F.Supp. 1529, 1536\n(S.D.N.Y.1985) (““[T]hose who aid or abet\nor conspire in tortious conduct are jointly\nand severally liable with other participants\nin the tortious conduct, regardless of the\ndegree of their participation or culpability\nin the overall scheme.”). The court found\nthat the defendant’s intimate relationship\nwith the burglar and her assistance in his\nother illegal ventures “defie[d] credulity\nthat [she] did not know that something\nillegal was afoot.” Halberstam, 705 F.2d\nat 486.\n\nIn Boim, the district court had denied a\nmotion to dismiss by U.S.-based charities\nalleged to have aided and abetted interna-\ntional terrorism. Bowm v. Quranic Litera-\ncy Inst. & Holy Land Found. 127\nF.Supp.2d 1002, 1018 (N.D.IIL2001)\n(“Bom I”). The Seventh Circuit affirmed\nthe decision and held that the parents of a\nyeshiva student killed in 1996 in Israel by\nmembers of the military wing of Hamas\ncould prove that the defendants aided and\nabetted their son’s murder under the ATA\nif they could demonstrate that the chari-\nties “knew of Hamas’ illegal activities, that\nthey desired to help those activities suc-\nceed, and they engaged in some act of\nhelping the illegal activities.” Bowm I],\n291 F.3d at 1023. The court explained\nthat “[floreseeability is the cornerstone of\n\nberstam, 705 F.2d at 477. It described the\nelements of civil conspiracy as: “(1) an agree-\nment between two or more persons; (2) to\nparticipate in an unlawful act, or a lawful act\nin an unlawful manner; (3) an injury caused\nby an unlawful overt act performed by one of\nthe parties to the agreement; (4) which overt\nact was done pursuant to and in furtherance\nof the common scheme.” Jd.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017863",
