They have, he concludes, just as\nmany problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost\ninvariably involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a science\nexperiment,” he recalled not long ago as we chatted about his life. “It did not\nreally involve me. I could just stand back and watch.”\n\nDalton fathers were attracted to him. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher\nof the New York Times, and a Dalton father at the time, tried to recruit\nEpstein to come to the Times. (Epstein recounts a story of riding with\nSulzberger in his wood paneled station wagon to the his country estate and\nSulzberger talking to the chauffer on a phone from the backseat to the front.)\n\nIn 1976, another Dalton father, asking “wouldn’t you rather be rich\nthan be a teacher?” introduced him to Bear Stern’s chief Ace Greenberg, a\nconversation Epstein recounts as this:\n\nGreenberg: “Everyone tells me you’re super smart in math and you’re\nJewish and you’re hungry...so why don’t you start working here tomorrow?”\n\nEpstein: “What?”\n\nGreenberg: “If your supposed to be so fucking smart, don’t you\nunderstand English?”\n\nEpstein: “Ok. Count me in.”\n\nHence, Epstein, like many in the late 70s, arrived on Wall Street.\n\nAs will happen to a generation of others, by the fortuitous luck of\nbeing on Wall Street at that point in time, Epstein is transformed by a new,\nmuch faster, form of upward mobility. With a facility for mathematics as\nwell as for getting along with rich men, he transforms at an even faster rate\nthan others being quickly transformed.\n\nHe moves into a new building at 66\" Street and Second Avenue—still\nin the shadow of the Maxwell Plum era when the 60s on Second was the\nglamour address—a building full of “actresses, models, and euro trash.” (It\nwould shortly become the Studio 54 era, where Epstein, who doesn’t drink\nor take drugs, was a regular).\n\nIf on one side of Wall Street there were the salesmen (the Wolf of Wall\nStreet model), on the other side there was a new sort of finance type able to\nembrace a level of acute abstraction.\n\n“In the past,” says Epstein, “investing was all about reputations and\nrelationships. You invested in a company on the basis of who was running it.\nDid they have integrity? Were they married? Good family men? It was a 50’s\nmentality. But in the mid 70s options started to be traded. In essence, the first\nformal derivatives. The movement of this instrument is not directly attached\nto the stock price. The world of investing began turning from relationships to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022716",
