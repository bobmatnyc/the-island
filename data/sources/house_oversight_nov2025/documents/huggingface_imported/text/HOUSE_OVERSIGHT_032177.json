What is described in some\nquarters as a recipe for new strife and confrontation can actually be\nleveraged into a win-win situation for Israelis, Palestinians and the\nworld.\n\nThe Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas want the United Nations to\ngrant them a sovereign state based on the 1967 boundaries with East\nJerusalem as its capital. That’s all. It is not asking the U.N. to solve\nthe refugee /right-of-return issue or to determine who owns the\nTemple Mount in Jerusalem. It is opting to convert an intractable\nconflict between a state and a liberation movement into a state-to-\nstate conflict with manageable parameters.\n\nWhy not offer the Palestinians what they want, but add elements that\ncould render the resolution acceptable to a majority of Israelis?\nIsrael wants acceptance as a Jewish state with its recognized capital in\nJerusalem. It needs assurances regarding the nature and priorities of\nfuture negotiations, with the truly intractable issues postponed to a\nlater phase. It needs solid security arrangements, understandings\nregarding Hamas rule in Gaza, and a viable incentive from an Arab\nworld that has long offered to reward it for moving forward with the\nPalestinians.\n\nHere are the components of a possible “win-win” U.N. resolution\nregarding Palestinian statehood:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032177",
