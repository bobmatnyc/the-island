They told me everything he did was illegal because |\n\nwas under age.’ (The age of consent in Florida is 18).\n\n‘They said that if it had to go to trial, they'd need me because I'd lived with him and that made me a\nkey witness. | was very afraid, because he had so much power, but eventually | agreed to testify.\n\n| was glad he’d finally been found out. He shouldn’t be hurting other girls. Following Epstein’s arrest,\ninvestigators are believed to have found a list of men’s names on his computer and asked him\nwhether they had been ‘treated’ to sexual encounters with his menage of minors.\n\n‘He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question,\nit could be incriminating,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday.\n\nEpstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a ‘slap on the wrist’ for him,\nand ended up serving 13 months of his sentence, much of it in a liberal work-release programme\nLawyer Brad Edwards, who represented several of Epstein’s victims, said: ‘Rather than punish him\nthe way they would an average Joe, they sent a clear message that with enough money and power\nand influence, the system can be bought.’\n\nVirginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings\nbottled up until last weekend’s photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories.\n\nVirginia says: ‘| am appalled. To me, it’s saying, “We are above the law.” But Jeffrey is a monster.’\n\nLast night, neither Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell nor Prince Andrew would comment on Virginia’s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShare or comment on this article\n\nSponsored Links by Taboola\n\nFROM THE WEB\n\nMiley Cyrus Just Revealed This Dog Lives Longer Than\n\nHer L.A.
