  "text": "Family and acquaintances, including a former Fort Worth police lieutenant,\nsubmitted letters to the court vouching for McDaniel’s character.\n\nThere were other issues, however, presented to the judge. While McDaniel was\nbeing held in federal lockup awaiting sentencing, he had corresponded with his\nvictim, despite being ordered not to contact her, the court record shows.\n\nStill, Hunt argued that a sentence of five years was overly harsh.\n\nVillafafia disagreed, but conceded that McDaniel would benefit from psychological\ntreatment. She advocated for a sentence of five to sex years, which was at the low\nend of the guideline.\n\nIt was then that the judge heard from the victim’s mother.\n\nIn a statement, the mother decried the emotional and mental trauma her daughter\nsuffered and the long road to recovery she had ahead of her. The mother mentioned\nshe was further upset that McDaniel continued contact with her daughter after his\narrest and she said she believed that McDaniel was still trying to manipulate her\ndaughter by blaming her for his arrest.\n\nThe mother pointed out that prior to their sexual encounter, McDaniel had directed\nher daughter to watch sexually explicit movies and had described for her sex\nactivities he had had with another underage girl.\n\nAt that point, the judge interrupted.\n\n“_.. [here has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do\nyou know about that, if anything?” Zloch asked Villafana.\n\n<acosta.jpg>\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta never told sexual-abuse victims of a lenient plea\ndeal for Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nGetty Images\n\nOnly then did Zloch learn that McDaniel had preyed on other girls over the internet,\nincluding a 16-year-old California girl whom he brought to Texas and impregnated.\nHe was also having another relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the time of his\narrest, Villafafa admitted in court.\n\nThe judge promptly sentenced McDaniel to 10 years — twice what Villafana\nrecommended.\n\nThree months later, in January 2007, after reviewing the entire case, Zloch issued\nan order excoriating Villafaiia for failing to tell him about McDaniel’s prior history.\n\n“The serial nature of defendant’s seduction of minor girls was revealed for the first\ntime to the court upon the Government’s response to the Court’s inquiry,” Zloch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021754",
