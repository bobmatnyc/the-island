  "text": "was a consequence of the high cost of my artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. -\nnow\n\nIf you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH\nassignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not\nprogressed very far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside\nteam will be brought in at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, .\nsucession, technology, tax and compliance. investment reporting , , computerized timelines for filings etc.\n. household classifcations and reporting with a system of best practices.\n\nMy goal is clear - to end, not extend , our financial interactions. you will have a machine that works , it\nwill not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for\nmy works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give\nyou a bad number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made\nperfectly clear . that you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but\nagain its value exceeds anything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please\nalso remember that you and i agreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big\ntransaction.\n\nOR, you can decide that brad , tom , and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they\ncan oversee your audits . they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought\nin but i would be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story.\n\n_-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make\nno judgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them . not my role I am always on\nyour side on the table. I hope your personal life quiets. you 've had a rough 15 months.\n\n3. Remind me to talk to you about MR\nDate: Mon, Sep 19, 2016 at 8:56 PM\nSubject:\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella hii,\n\ndec 2015\nIT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off\nexercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead,\n,consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals\nreceived without brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he\nknows little of finance, is run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using\nyour power, to appear larger . Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge\ndifference. bad info is rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer\nexamination it turns out they cannot be used at all. (ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they\nwere deducted on the return they said that is the question they get asked! \" were they deducted \"not -\"\nis there a benefit\" !! I asked for the balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in\norder to check your financials. \"sorry we never got one?\" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing ,\na construction project run amok , no budget, the coo fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that\nartspace financials are also a total mess.\n\nAs your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive\nThe following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by\nme.\n\nisuggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain\nthe paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you consider\nhaving the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023247",
