  "text": "growth theory says such restraint doesn’t happen. Data say the same. I apply the\n\nsame idea in next generation theory.\n\nMy 3.5% is a rough estimate. What counts is the generation length. The length was\nprobably higher, and the rate lower, before medicine and sanitation lowered\nmortality rates, and let two or three births per couple meet the need for population\n\nreplenishment.\n\nThe cash flow or pure consumption rate modeled at 3.5% might also vary for\nreasons other than changes in the generation length. My charts show the pure\nconsumption/total capital rate as higher in the middle part of the twentieth century\nas people drained capital reserves to keep up consumption in times of world-wide\n\ndepression. I’ll say more about these reserves.\n\nFirst Interpretation\n\nNext generation theory says in effect that R. A. Fisher’s version of the generation\nlength, not Petty’s primogeniture version, gives the period of production of total\ncapital. We would miss the point if we focused on the period production of human\ncapital separately. Total capital is our means of lineage survival. This reinforces my\ntheme that human capital does not mean humans. It means skill sets priced at\npresent value of foreseen cash flow. Skill sets are not enough for lineage survival.\nWe also need things. We should not fall into the trap of surplus value theory, which\nhad been taught by communists for decades before Karl Marx joined their ranks, in\nsupposing that skills make things. It is only half the truth. Skills plus things make\n\nskills plus things as the generations repeat.\nNor should we make the mistake of supposing that the generation length begins and\nends uniquely from birth to birth, so that the remaining period of production grows\n\nshorter over adult life and the time discount rate steeper. The period of a cycle is the\n\nsame at any point. The young, simply by maturing, are already investing in their\n\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 21\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011080",
