  "text": "Freedom House\n\nConclusion\n\nAuthoritarianism Comes Calling\n\nUntil very recently, the spread of the methods and strategies\ndescribed in this report has largely been greeted with complacency\nand indifference in the democratic world. Even as it became clear\nthat the rejection of liberal values by Russia, China, and other\nauthoritarian states was a permanent fixture of global politics,\ndemocracies convinced themselves that although modern\nauthoritarianism posed a challenge to the spread of freedom beyond\nits current reach, their own freedoms were in no jeopardy.\n\nIn the aftermath of the stunning events of 2016, it is\napparent that the post-Cold War democratic order is\nin fact facing an unprecedented threat. Britain’s vote\nto leave the European Union (EU), the election of Don-\nald Trump as president of the United States, and the\nemergence of populist demagogues across Europe\nhave all raised questions about the future of democra-\ncy in its traditional bastions.\n\nIt can no longer be assumed that Russia's challenge\nto democracy is limited to its policies of internal\nrepression and aggression toward neighbors like\nUkraine and Georgia. The Kremlin’s development of\nparallel institutions—government-controlled civil\nsociety, a propaganda machine based on the latest\nmedia technologies, realistic but purely decorative\nelections—was once regarded as a project intended\nfor Russia alone. When Angela Merkel, in response to\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine, exclaimed that Vladimir\nPutin lives in a different world, she meant a specif-\nically Russian universe where facts are irrelevant,\ninternational treaties are obsolete, and sovereignty is\na matter of power rather than law.\n\nNow, however, the Kremlin has attempted to project\nthis version of reality onto the democratic world. In\nthe United States, Russia brazenly interfered in the\nelectoral process through hacking efforts sponsored\nby its intelligence agencies. Whether this interference\nactually affected the outcome of the election is sub-\n\nject to debate. But there is strong evidence, endorsed\nby the entirety of the U.S. intelligence establishment\nand numerous independent analyses, that the inter-\nference did occur.\n\nJust as worrying is the suggestion that the United\nStates, much like Russia itself, has entered a “post-truth\nera,” in which lies and distortions carry as much weight\nas facts. Clearly, at least some of this hand-wring-\n\ning was a partisan reaction to Trumps victory. But it\nfollowed an election in which the winning candidate\nfalsely claimed, among other things, that the balloting\nwas rigged against him, that violent crime had reached\nrecord levels, and that undocumented immigrants were\nresponsible for a large share of the violence.\n\nMeanwhile, as of early 2017, populist parties with Rus-\nsian-friendly platforms and histories of nativism and\n\nother forms of bigotry were expected to gain ground in\nupcoming elections in countries like the Netherlands,\nFrance, and Germany.\n\nAs it became more obvious that the democracies\nwere poorly equipped to contend with resurgent\nauthoritarianism, the leading autocracies were exper-\nimenting with more frightening methods of assuring\ndomestic political control.\n\nChina in particular seemed to take an Orwellian\nturn with the planned introduction of a social credit\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\n57\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019291",
