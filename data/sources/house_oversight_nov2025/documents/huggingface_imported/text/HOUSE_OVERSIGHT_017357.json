  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nI think the President could win if it actually went to trial, but it\nwon’t go to trial. What I would do if I were his lawyer is to say,\n“Look, the dignity of the office precludes the [President from\nanswering any of these questions. We realize that as a result of not\nanswering these questions, we will reluctantly, without admitting\nanything, have to be sanctioned by having the verdict directed\nagainst us on the merits. We accept that because we can’t answer\nthe questions and preserve the dignity. And now let’s move on to\nthe damages, where the focus is not on the [P]resident but on Paula\nJones.” And in that way, he can, in effect, settle the case, even if\nthe other side doesn’t settle because the damages will be very low,\nthere won’t be an apology. There’ll be a judgment against him, but\nthe judgment will be explained on the basis of the dignity of the\npresidency. So if the settlement talks fail, that’s what I would\nrecommend that his lawyers think about. . . .\n\nAnd the [P]resident has to start asking himself: Is he well advised\nhere?\n\nThe President had three options, but he was aware of only two of them. He knew that he could\nlitigate and try to win — as he ended up doing. He also knew that he could try to settle the case,\nwhich would have avoided the necessity of testifying at the deposition or trial. A settlement\nrequires both sides to agree. In the Jones case, the president reportedly offered to pay Jones\n$700,000, in order to settle the case. Jones insisted on an apology® and the settlement talks\neventually broke down.\n\nThe third option, of which the president was unaware, was to default the Jones case. Every\nlitigant in a civil case has the right to default — which means, essentially, to settle the case\nunilaterally by simply refusing to contest the allegations in the complaint. Consider, for example,\nthe following hypothetical case: a fired employee of a high tech business sues for $10,000 in back\npay. The business realizes that in order to defend its actions, it would have to reveal commercial\nsecrets valued at $1,000,000 and take the time of executives which it estimates at being worth\n$200,000. It offers to settle the case for the $10,000 that the employee is demanding, but the\nangry employee prefers a trial at which he will be publicly vindicated. The company has the right\nsimply to default, have the judgment entered against it, and have the court order it to the pay the\ndamages sought by the employee. No stigma is attached to defaulting a case. It does not even\nnecessarily entail an admission of liability. It represents a practical assessment of the costs and\nbenefits of litigating and not litigating — just as a settlement does.\n\nRobert Bennett never told President Clinton that he could have defaulted and paid Jones without\nmaking any apology. Perhaps the Lewinsky story would have leaked, but the President would not\nhave had to dignify a rumor with a response. It was the entirely avoidable decision to have him\n\n%° Paula Jones’ lawyer have subsequently revealed that the Jones lawsuit could have been settled at one point for no\nmoney with just a simple apology from President Clinton which made it clear that Paula Jones did not do anything\nwrong in the hotel room.\n\n270\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017357",
