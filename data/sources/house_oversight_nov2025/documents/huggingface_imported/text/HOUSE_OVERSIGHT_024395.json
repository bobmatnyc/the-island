He has been a producer of several documentary films and assists numerous non-profit organizations. \nHe is the author of The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True Threat. \nFP: Bill Siegel, welcome to FrontPage Interview. \nCongratulations on this brilliant book. It is without question one of the most vital works of our time. \nLet's begin with what inspired you to write it. \nSiegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage of \nHitler and the Third Reich and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil that \nseemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the blindness. \nFollowing 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, terrorism and \nso on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates. \nRather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the \nfrightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to \ncatalog many of my friends' different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure. \nThe more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the \nmental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain. \nFP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as \"that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep us \nblind\" and that \"process of a voiding seeing the threats we face.\" It's also about, as you state, trying to believe \nthat the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound insights you \nmake in terms of the Control Factor. \nSiegel: First, let's distinguish the \"real world\" where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield \nwhich occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what is \n\"out there\" and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our internal \nminds become anxious and sense a loss of \"control,\" they tend to concoct ways to distort our perceptions so as \nto restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an \"active and continuous process\" \ndesigned to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our thinking and feeling \nprocesses are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening prospects, the mind is \ngeared to actively distort. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024396 \nSimilarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In \nturn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and thus \nseemingly all the more \"real.\" In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy McCarthy \nentitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer than we are \naware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out \nmaneuver our conscious thinking. \nSince World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of \nAmerica's history has been about \"over there,\" where we have always known that if things got too out of hand \n(e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have had \nvirtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting on this \npoint). \nConsequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a film, \nthere is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know there is \na threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc. This threat \nis typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial exposition \nshows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain it in \nfamiliar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The next \nstage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it, to \nappease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to not \nadequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes instead. \nThe final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters remain alive. I \nnamed this the \"turnaround moment\" when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as the threat. That \nchange in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for whichever \ncharacters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the threat. \nThis is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny \nthat which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we \nstill have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in. \nI said ear her that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid where \non the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of maneuvers the \nmany \"D's\" as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial, demonization, deflection, \ndeletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered upon these are moves such \nas projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in them or introject traits from \nthem into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve a mixing of identities where \nwe actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and introjection are active almost \nacross the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy accuses us of is more \nappropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our need to be liked, and o ther \npsychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies. \nAs these narratives (\"Our courts will never allow that,\" \"As a superpower we will always be able to win any \nfight we put our minds to,\" \"Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized\" ...) gain consent from others \nthey tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship we \ntake with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this \nrelationship is the \"transfer of responsibility\" in which we assume responsibility for the enemy's behavior who \nis addicted to transferring it away from itself The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship and \nmakes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction. And just as \nan addict needs to devote serious effort and con sciousness to his addiction, so must we devote great energy to \nunders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us. \nFP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad against us. \nWhat are they? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024397 \nSiegel: Simply stated, our Islamic Enemy seeks the totalitarian domination of Islam throughout the world — \nIslamic supremacy. It seeks to have the West submit to Islam. Obviously, this does not mean that everybody \nbecomes a Muslim. Islam, in all its varied expressions, permits dhimmis- those Christians, Jews, and some \nothers who are permitted to remain as protected non-Muslims as long as they submit to an inferior status. What \nis critical is that Shariah (Islamic Law) ultimately rules the world. \nJihad, loosely, is the effort/struggle to see this vision through. The most obvious method of Jihad is through \nviolence; it is the one most familiar to most Westerners and almost all of the Koranic references to Jihad are \nbased in violence. The Violent Jihad includes al-Qaeda and its offshoots as well as other groups that formed \naround the globe independent of al-Qaeda. It also obviously includes the violence from Islamic nations such as \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran whose constitution specifies such vision. It also includes, however, various \nmilitant groups and training camps here in the US as well as ad hoc efforts of individuals. \nSince 9/11, there have been something in excess of 15,000 Violent Jihadic attacks across the globe. However, \nas terrible as this is, we have a tendency in the West to think that the only dimension of threat we face comes \nfrom violence. While the Bush administration helped initiate this thinking, the Obama administration has \nactively abused it by limiting any discussion of the threat we face to al-Qaeda and some other terrorist groups \nabroad. As frightening as these groups are, we can get some ease from thinking they are a band of \"extremists \nlimited in number, weaponry, sophisticati on, and means. Stunningly, Hillary Clinton recently estimated that \nthere are only about 50,000 \"homicidal\" violent extremists around the world who simply have been able to \nproject power much greater than their number should allow. Here the Control Factor makes the threat appear \nmore easily manageable. \nJihad, however, is pursued in other often even more effective ways which I have grouped into three \"levels.\" A \nsecond more insidious level of threat is what the Muslim Brotherhood itself called the \"Civilization Jihad.\" It \nis the effort to infiltrate all aspects of our society, peacefully according to our laws, in order to later be in \nposition to sabotage and destroy it from the inside. The Civilization Jihadists have learned the culture and rules \nof the territories they seek to command and use those rules to maneuver—specifically using our freedoms to \ndestroy our freedoms. They use \"lawfare\" to seek changes in our laws so as to push Shariah into our society. \nYour readers should read Daniel Pipes and Brooke Goldstein's Lawfare Project material and others to fully \nappreciate how cancerous this activity has become. This includes intimidating in a variety of ways anyone who \nspeaks out against them or Islam and seeking to squelch our treasured broad right to free speech so as to \nultimately prevent any criticisms of Islam. Once criticism of Islam is prohibited, little can stop it from \ncascading throughout the culture. \nThe Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical positions in the society, in the government, in \nthe legal system, the military, and elsewhere. It includes the control over university programs that distribute \npropaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down throughout textbooks for even younger \nstudents. It includes control over most of the nation's mosques and local Imams guiding the mess ages engaged \nMuslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim g roups (CAIR, ISNA, MSA and others associated \nand/or joint venture partners with the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly interested in \"outreach\" which know \nhow to appear Westernized and interested in the goals of Western Civilization. They have fooled a large part of \nour authorities and media due in part to their patience and willingness to chip away, one airport prayer room, \none frivolous intimidating lawsuit, one Congressman or CIA officer, one mosque, one ruling at a time. \nParticularly in the US, given our deep attachment to freedom as well as cultural and psychological tendencies \ntoward diversity, Western guilt and expectations of truthfulness, this effort is devious and difficult to uproot. \nThe Civilization Jihadists present one face to the American public which is completely at odds with their true \nagenda and how they deal in private. Jamie, you and David and others such as Steve Emerson, Frank Gaffney, \nAndy McCarthy and others have done s o much to uncover this level of Jihad that your readers should be urged \nto review as much of their work (including Steve's recent excellent documentary, The Grand Deception,  and \nFrank's important web video course, The Muslim Brotherhood in America) as possible. \nFinally, there is a third level — the International Institutional Jihad. Here the most powerful international \ninstitutions such as the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others seek to push into America \nfrom without those changes which are difficult to complete from within. The OIC is the largest Islamic \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024398 \ninstitution in the world. It essentially controls the vote in the UN's General Assembly and thus explains in part \nthe absurd and abject pro-Islamic, anti-Israel thrust of that organizat ion. This level seeks to use the power of \nIslamic nations to work fro m outside the West to force changes within the West. While there are various \nconflicts between many of the nations, being Islamic majority states, there is a great deal they agree upon \nwhich becomes the focus of these efforts. Just as the Obama administration is beginning to cooperate with \ninternational efforts to control gun ownership, so has Hillary Clinton's Istanbul Process become a dangerous \nstep in the effort to restrict speech critical of Islam by norm (or possibly even treaty) when it may not be fully \nexecutable by domestic action alone. \nI should point out that Stephen Coughlin, the former Pentagon officer who has an important must-see \npresentation of Islamic Law, uses different names for these same three levels — Jihad, Dawa, and Ummah. Had \nI seen his work before I wrote my book I would have conformed to his categorizations. \nWe must learn how powerful language has become on all three levels. Words such as \"peace,. $B!1 \n\"freedom,\" \"terrorism,\" and phrases such as \"human rights\" have different meanings for us and for our Islamic \nEnemy. To oversimplify, \"peace\" is not something for now but that which comes when all the earth is \nsubmitting to Islam. In the context of battles, \"peace\" is at best a temporary ceasefire. \"Freedom\" is best \nunderstood as having the freedom to fully submit to Islam, not to choose whatever beliefs one desires while \nrespecting the same right in others. We've all seen how \"human rights\" and \"terror\" really only apply among \nMuslims, not to non-Muslims. Our enemy fully understands these differences and uses them at all levels to \nparalyze us. \nLook simply at how the phrase \"Israeli-Palestinian conflict\" has equalized the two parties, making it all the \neasier to ascribe features of one to the other and view the problem as a simple-to fix division of ass ets into \nstatehoods but for personality problems among the leaders. The simple truth is that this is and has always been \na one-sided Arab war against Israel as Ruth Wisse and others have described and, as Bibi Netanyahu made \nclear, the ONLY state truly at issue here has been the State of Israel that the Arabs have refused for over half a \ncentury. Nonetheless, the Control Factor hypnotically abuses the mind's susceptibility to the intricacies of \nlanguage. \nEven the label \"Peace Process\" has been damaging language. While most focus upon the first word, turning \nthis into a \"process\" has helped ensure that peace is never obtained. It is more appropriately called the \n\"Extortion Process\" because all that results is that violence is used over decades to extract concessions from \nIsrael. \nThese three levels must be understood for their differences while united by a single goal. While these levels \noften op erate together and assist each other, we must avoid \"level confusion\" which the Control Factor \nemploys to curtail our fears. If the Obama narrative is swallowed- that the only threat is the Violent Jihad- we \nwill miss the other contamination fomenting within our borders. We must appreciate how these levels work \ntogether and even unite with other forces such as the global Leftist movement that you, Jamie, have described \nso forcefully in United in Hate. \nFP: You write about how we like to talk of \"Good Muslims\" and how we are always on the eternal search for \n\"moderate\" Muslims (Khatami, Mousavi, Abbas, etc), while we stress how the \"extremists\" are the real \nproblem and how \"few\" they really are. All of this is connected to the Control F actor. Enlighten us. \nSiegel: The Control Factor seeks to have us feel in control of the situation. The easiest way to do this is to \nsimply minimize the number of potential enemies. We have been lectured for years about how Islam is a \n\"religion of peace\" and that the violence we see (remember that we have already improperly limited the \nproblem to violence) is the product of a small number of \"crazies\" (remember Hillary Clinton's 50,000) who \nhave distorted Islam. I call this the \"Peaceful Muslim Disclaimer\" as virtually everyone in the press and \ngovernment has been bullied into making some statement of the kind to silence those who will pressure them \nthat they are \"Islamophobic\" and Islam is being attacked. (These are the Islam hustlers who operate on the \nsame principles that black race hustlers so effectively used to extort concessions over the last six decades or \nso). \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024399 \nNobody has done any real work to support this proposition, nor is it clear exactly how it would be tested. My \nview is that the grammar \"Islam is x\" is itself problematic because Islam has expressed itself throughout \nhistory in a variety of fashions. It is more useful to talk in terms of how seriously engaged with Islam, the \nKoran and other texts, a Muslim is. What is significant is how Muslims today are using Islam and most of \nthose who are in power either throughout a large territory or within a small community tend toward, if not fully \nadvocate, the very supremacist ideas that we try to tell ourselves are reserved for the \nfew \"extremists.\" Presumably most Germans did not wish to see all Nazi atrocities carried out but in the end \nthey fell in line because they had to. Those our politicians and press call the \"extremists\" are in one sense more \naccurately the \"good\" Muslims who ar e following their Islamic beliefs dutifully. \nFP: Tell us how Western shame and guilt play into all of this. \nSiegel: One of the dirty little secrets the Control Factor preys upon is that if we believe we control something \nwe can comfort ourselves that we can change it. Remember the horror film- the threat has one purpose and that \nis to destroy you. You can not change it, talk it out of it, teach it alternatives or otherwise. That is what makes \nit so inherently frightening. If we can convince ourselves that we caused the threat to act the way it does we \ncan maintain the secret hope that we can change it. Consequently, there is a tremendous attraction to blaming \nourselves for the Islamic Enemy's behavior. And we see this power in our readily accepting responsibility for \nterror- because of our occupation, our greedy quest for oil, our failure to extend a hand of \"engagement,\" \nIsrael's building settlements, our making videos that defa me Mohammed and so on. Again, the relationship is \ndefined by the enemy blaming us for his actions and our accepting such responsibility. \nShelby Steele has written brilliantly about what he calls \"white guilt\" and outlines how whites during the 60's \nand thereafter were pressured into a transaction whereby in order to re-obtain a sense of moral authority they \naccepted blame for the condition of blacks and behaved as if guilty. Blacks were able to extract great \nconcessions and whites were able to view themselves as morally restored and redeemed. At a certain point, \nhowever, the behavior takes on a life of its own and the narratives become deeply embedded in the culture and, \nas we can see today, difficult to uproot. \nWestern guilt is an extension of Steele's notion. President Obama's confessionals to the Arab world admitting \nthat America has made \"mistakes\" and was not born a colonial pow er express this same tendency to appease \nthrough guilt. Hillary Clint on's \"reset\" with Russia conveyed the same submissive request for a more \nacceptable response. In being guilty we presume the other party will recognize our contrition and respond in \nlike kind. One of the Control Factor's most devastating moves is employed- presuming the other is just like us \nand will respond the way we would. This is frequently how an enabler justifies his continuous support for an \naddict. The problem, however is that our Islamic Enemy is NOT like us and will not respond in like kind. \nRather, as we repeatedly refuse to learn, appeasement invites more abuse from an enemy. This becomes \nthe \"game of guilt;\" it tends to expand to greater and greater consequences. Paradoxically, psychological \ndefenses tend to create the very outcomes they seek to eliminate and it is no different here. It is a game we love \nto play but, unfortunately, the game gives us no rules for how to end it. \nAll beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with other \nControl Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing. \nFP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely because of our \nControl Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers. \nSiegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see what he was \nabout, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that could \nallow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist views and \nJihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the \"painful liquidation\" of non-Muslims. Yet, in the \nArmy of all places, the Control Factor operated to allow and even foster his work. Even after the murders, we \ncont inue the denial by calling it \"workplace violence.\" He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad combo! And we \ncontinue to enable the same infiltration elsewhere. \nFP: Tell our readers about \"The Project\" and \"Explanatory Memorandum.\" These are realities that serve as \ngreat threats to the Control Factor, right? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024400 \nSiegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood's goals and plans underlying \nthe Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The 1991 Explanatory \nMemorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the Brotherhood's work in \nAmerica as a \"Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means\" and \"a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating \nand destroying the Western civilization from within and 'sabotaging' its miserable house by their own hands \nand the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God's religion is made victorious over all other \nreligions.\" \nMuch as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term plan to \ndestroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the nuclear family, \nsecularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to infiltrate while \neroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The Control Factor has \nmany ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system would never allow \nsuch a thing, that one is racist or \"Islamophobic,\" if not insane, for even thinking this is real. And just as with \nthe communists, time is plentiful. Even more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-decade plan is short term. It \nis not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is critical, more correctly a duty, \nhowever, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for Security Policy's Team B Report, \nShariah: The Threat to America, are excellent sources for your readers to pursue these documents. \nFP: And so what you call an \"Inner Jihad\" has to start. It's our, as you say, mandatory \"addiction treatment.\" \nPlease explain. \nSiegel: The \"Inner Jihad\" is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control Factors. There is a \nfamous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical fight \nwas the \"lesser Jihad\" and it is time to then attend to the \"greater Jihad 4\"- that internal battle against our own \ninternal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to say that \n\"Jihad\" is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally against our \nown Control Factor tendencies. \nAs I said earlier, the Control Factor is \"active\" and \"continuous\" so we must constantly monitor and combat \nit. Like \"Whack-a-Mole,\" just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use the \nterms \"addict\" and \"enabler\" because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the \nControl Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a typical \naddict and his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler act \nessentially addicted to his behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship involves the \ntransfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant actions onto us with our response framed \nessentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy's grievance. (Your book, United in Hate, \ndescribes this addiction to hate in detail. \nThe key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant \nactions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the \nenemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are \nnot. We must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are consistent \nwith our principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its intrusion. This is an \nindividual endeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book gives plenty of examples \nof each maneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the unique workings of his own mind. \nThat takes the work of the Inner Jihad. \nFP: Share with our readers what you mean by the \"Turnaround Moment.\" \nSiegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed to their limit. \nThey then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat they face. No more moral \nhigh ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat's essence. As Lee Harris described in The  \nSuicide of Reason, it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as ruthless that is \ncritical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive efforts at denial to finally clearly focus on \nthe threat faced. Part of the Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner rather than later. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024401 \nFP: You suggest that \"mirroring\" should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it. \nSiegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we have been \ninappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the enemy \nuses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression while we respond only. \nMirroring means that we demonstrate our willingness to act symmetrically, to be governed by the same rules. \nIt is stunning how much is accomplished when one's attitude simply is clear that he will do what is necessary; \noften not much else is needed as the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally changed. But other \ntimes action is absolutely needed. Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the enemy as it treats us carries \ngreat meaning. Imagine (international law aside) if Israel announced that from now on it will mirror Hamas \nsuch that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs from Gaza, Israel will do the same (it is accused of such \nanyway). The population might finally rethink and take responsibility for its privilege of voting its leaders. As \nstated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we teach the other the effects of his behavior. \nConversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is necessary to highlight \nour differences with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO drawing an \nequivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their relativistic\" \nnarratives.\" Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch's website has demonstrated for years, there is nothing in the \nWest anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed daily by the Palestinian Authority, including through its \neducation system. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initially funded the \"study,\"- in \nwhat appears to be an attempt to sanitize the PA's record so that the US can continue to fund the PA against \nthe spirit of US law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these \nschoolbooks along with other media \"profoundly poison(s) the minds of these children.\" It is most important \nthat we do not succumb to this type of use of symmetry that distorts the profound differences between us and \nthe enemy. \nEssentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with international rules, how to bes t fight this \nenemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we do not know how nor are we yet competent to \nstop our addictions. This is not a book about policy. In fact, the \"right\" policies are unlikely to emerge until a \ncritical mass has meaningfully dealt with their Control Factors and share a common perspective. We like to \nlook at our history and assume a single perspective throughout but the truth is that we had to learn how to \nrespond to Pearl Harbor, the Nazis, the Cold War etc. The same applies here. Our press promotes \"elites\" who \nare tasked with acting as if they possess the \"true wisdom\" to deal with our threats but the truth is we do not \nknow nor are we equipped to marshal enough of our population to agree just yet. The sooner we learn, \nhowever, the less we will suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those lessons. \nI have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, the language \nof \"feeling s\" had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of \"action;\" we would do terrible \nacts that would cause bad feelings in the enemy which would then serve to justify whatever response it \nmade. It had always been a question of the harsh insensitive acts Westerners do against Muslims and the \nresulting hurt, loss, shame etc. that Muslims experience. The Ground Zero Mosque incident, however, broke \nnew ground because all of a sudden non-Muslims' feelings became the focus and were cast as resulting from \nMuslim acts. Another example was seen in how quickly the attempt to blame the Benghazi murders on \nthe video about Mohammad fell apart. Just as large corporations eventually learned to turn away from \nshakedown attempts from race baiters, we are beginning to learn to demand symmetry through mirroring. A \nword of caution: When enablers change their behavior and demand symmetrical rules for the addict, the latter \ntypically initially erupts with great resistance. This is a stage we must be prepared to tolerate and fully \nwithstand as it creates the only real chance for the addict to finally change. It is critical, therefore, that when \nwe finally engage in mirroring that we be prepared to see it through completion. \nFP: What if we fail to engage in our own Inner Jihad and the Control Factor stays firmly in place? \nSiegel: Critical to the Inner Jihad is the realization that our civilization is fragile; not to be taken for granted. \nOur demands for multi-culturalism and diversity have bumped heads with the simple paradox that tolerating \nthe intolerant leads to extinction. Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the most crystalline version of asymmetry \nwe have accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST place the Koran above all law while in America, the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024402 \nConstitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad, founder of CAIR, reputedly said, \"Islam isn't in Amer ica to be \nequal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in America and Islam is \nthe only accepted religion on Earth.\" Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the Control Factor \nconstantly seeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be negotiated. Only one \ncan survive not because we have declared \"war\" but because our Islamic Enemy has. That is, perhaps, the \nlesson we will most need to fully learn, one way or another. We will eventually hit a Turnaround Moment as a \nnation and if enough of us are not truly prepared to fight and continue to be controlled by our delusions, we \nwill lose. If we truly seek to win, it is better to get there sooner while we have advantages than later. \nFP: Bill Siegel, thank you for joining FrontPage Interview. \nAnd thank you for writing this superb and most important book. \nWe encourage all o four readers to get their hands on The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True Threat \nand to read it! \nEditor's note: To watch The Glazov Gang's recent discussion about the Muslim Brotherhood's \ninfiltration of the United States and the Obama administration, see this week's episode below: \nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here. \nFiled Under: Daily Mailer, FrontPage Tagged With: Denial, Islam, muslim brotherhood, Obama, Siegel, The \nControl Factor  \n22 \na Print This Post  \nAbout Jamie Glazov  \nJamie Glazov is Frontpage Magazine's editor.

The mental side is a minefield of constructs, \ndeeply implanted within generations of Americans, and its PC chickens are coming home to roost. So much so, \nmillions of Americans (westerners) cannot break free of its shackles. But it is not as if these mental chains \nmagically appe ared.

By & quot;them\" I mean \nthose who have allegiance to a socio-political system disguised as a religion that seeks world dominance by \nman imposed methodology/effort -- unlike Judaism and Christianity properly understood. If we are to \n\"believe\", the world already has a King and does not need a Caliph. \nReport \nReply \n0 \nMikeWood 6 hours ago  \nGround-breaking, brilliant. There are absolutely essentially lessons to be learned from this. Buy this book, read \nit, study it, and lend it to your friends and colleagues. Do it. \nReport \nReply \n0 \nlambsev77 54p 4 hours ago \nThe fall of Rome... The fall of the 3rd Reich... The fall of Western Civilization... \n00000h...

Mia farrow has no clue what the right to bear arms means and because of \nthat she needs to shut the hell up. As far as blacks go-- I grew up in the 70's coming home from Hallahan H.S. \nin Philadel phia, me and my small group of girls were swarmed by a mob of black girls who would kick and \nslap and pull hair without provocation, of course we would fight back but then that was back in the day when \nwhites weren't sissies. Still I made excuses for them. Black men would get in my face for no other reason than \nto intimidate me. rocks were thrown a my car for no reason. So, in short, based on my experiences Blacks are \nthe cause of racism and if they hate whites so much then they should stay away completely and totally. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024404 \nReport \nReply \n+1 \n4 \n@WolfyJam  - 2 hours ago  \nI read the Control factor and it was excellent. I wish more people would realize that our country is at its most \nvulnerable than ever in its history. the jihadis have basically taken over the inner cities. Islam's love for \nviolence coupled with ignorance and narcissim are a recipe for disaster. I hope Americans wake up in time to \nsave their future. I'm not optimistic though. I think its over but still I fight on. \nReport \nReply \nPost a new comment \nTop of Form \nBottom of Form \nComment as a Guest, or login: \nLogin to IntenseDebate \nLogin to WordPress.com \nLogin to Twitter \nTop of Form \nName \nEmail \nDisplayed next to your comments. \nNot displayed publicly. \nBottom of Form \nSubmit Comment \nSubscribe to \nFPM appreciates your comments that abide by the following guidelines: \n1.
