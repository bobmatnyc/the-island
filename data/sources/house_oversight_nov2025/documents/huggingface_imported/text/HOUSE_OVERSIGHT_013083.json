  "text": "9.4 Naive Physics 167\n\nwhen you figure out that you need to pressure the knife slightly harder when spreading peanut\nbutter rather than jelly, you’re not making this judgment using Newtonian physics or the\nNavier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics; you’re using heuristic patterns that you figured out\nthrough experience. Maybe you figured out these patterns through experience spreading peanut\nbutter and jelly in particular. Or maybe you figured these heuristic patterns out before you ever\ntried to spread peanut butter or jelly specifically, via just touching peanut butter and jelly to\nsee what they feel like, and then carrying out inference based on your experience manipulating\nsimilar tools in the context of similar substances.\nOther examples of similar “naive physics” patterns are easy to come by, e.g.\n\nWhat goes up must come down.\n\nA dropped object falls straight down.\n\nA vacuum sucks things towards it.\n\nCentrifugal force throws rotating things outwards.\n\nAn object is either at rest or moving, in an absolute sense.\n\nTwo events are simultaneous or they are not.\n\nWhen running downhill, one must lift one’s knees up high.\n\nWhen looking at something that you just barely can’t discern accurately, squint.\n\nCONOR WN\n\nAttempts to axiomatically formulate naive physics have historically come up short, and we\ndoubt this is a promising direction for AGI. However, we do think the naive physics literature\ndoes a good job of identifying the various phenomena that the human mind’s naive physics deals\nwith. So, from the point of view of AGI environment design, naive physics is a useful source\nof requirements. Ideally, we would like an AGI’s environment to support all the fundamental\nphenomena that naive physics deals with.\n\nWe now describe some key aspects of naive physics in a more systematic manner. Naive\nphysics has many different formulations; in this section we draw heavily on [SC94], who divide\nnaive physics phenomena into 5 categories. Here we review these categories and identify a\nnumber of important things that humanlike intelligent agents must be able to do relative to\neach of them.\n\n9.4.1 Objects, Natural Units and Natural Kinds\n\nOne key aspect of naive physics involves recognition of various aspects of objects, such as:\n\nRecognition of objects amidst noisy perceptual data\n\nRecognition of surfaces and interiors of objects\n\nRecognition of objects as manipulable units\n\nRecognition of objects as potential subjects of fragmentation (splitting, cutting) and of\nunification (gluing, bonding)\n\nRecognition of the agent’s body as an object, and as parts of the agent’s body as objects\n6. Division of universe of perceived objects into “natural kinds”, each containing typical and\natypical instances\n\nmw N\n\nGr\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013083",
