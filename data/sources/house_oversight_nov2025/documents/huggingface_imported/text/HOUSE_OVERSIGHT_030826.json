  "text": "there are different military groups, using terrorist methods against the government\nforces, as well as against each other. The most prominent of them, the Free Syrian\nArmy, is not strong enough to defeat Assad’s forces. Even if the US provides the FSA\nwith light weapons, this opposition group is outnumbered by hundreds of\nthousands against Assad’s army. Even according to the most exaggerated estimates,\nthe size of the FSA does not exceed 20,000 soldiers, while Assad’s army counts as\n\nmany as 400,000, equipped with heavy and sophisticated weapons.\n\nDue to the uprising, different extremist military groups have been able to cross the\nborder and enter Syria. One of the leading armed groups, Al-Nusra Front, an affiliate\nof the world’s largest terrorist organizations Al-Qaeda, has been included by the US\nin the international terrorism blacklist. It is important to note that these rebels have\nmany supply channels, making it impossible for the US to control which group will\nbe receiving the weapons, creating the risk of the US arms being used by terrorists\n\nagainst America or its allies in the region.\n\nMoreover, after two years of fighting against the regime, the opposition forces have\nstarted to turn guns on each other, fighting for power and territory. This\nsignificantly undermines their ability to form a united government, decreasing the\nprobability of a strong alternative force. Providing military groups with weapons\n\nwill only escalade the violence, lead to more massacre and _destruction.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030826",
