  "text": "Estimates vs. Consensus: Mostly inline to the Street\n\nWe are slightly above the street on revenue at $189mn vs. $188mn, but in-line on\nEBITDA at $20mn. Cost cutting could improve EBITDA and Zynga has restructured some\nof its workforce and is focusing on driving more engagement with live events in its\ngame franchises. For 2017, we are below the Street on revenue at $779mn vs. $805mn,\nbut above on EBITDA at $101mn vs $99mn.\n\nTable 33: Zynga Estimate Summary\n\n1Q17 2017 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofA ML est. $189 $196 $779 $786\nGrowth Y/Y% 41% 41% 5% 1%\nStreet $188 5200 $805 $875\nBofA ML vs Street Above Below Below Below\nEBITDA\nBofA ML est. 520 520 $101 $106\nStreet $20 $24 $99 $122\nBofA ML vs Street Above Below Above Below\nEPS\nBofA ML est. $0.01 $0.01 $0.05 $0.06\nStreet $0.02 $0.02 $0.07 $0.08\nBofA ML vs Street Below Below Below Below\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, company report\n\nZynga is improving profitability while engaging players better with live services but we\nremain cautious on the company’s ability to materially grow its audience and still favor\nthe console gaming group. Zynga should have downside support given roughly $1.50 in\ncash and assets and strategic franchise value (we estimate Poker/Slots generates over\n$250mn+ in revenue annually}. Our $2.70 PO is based on 11x 2018E EBITDA (which is a\npremium to the Mobile gaming peer group due to margin expansion potential}, plus\n$1.41/share in cash and assets (building).\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 = 51\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014937",
