  "text": "Over the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins and attempted negotiations, and\nthen, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students to be\narrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called Introductory Police Brutality. These were\n\nfrom the lab notes student took.\n\nThere was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who—long after she had forgotten what some\nprofessor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment—would\nremember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that if\nshe planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine\n\nforesight to remove the earrings from her pierced lobes in advance.\n\nSo, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been happening heavily at Berkeley campus again.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump grabbed a pussy on the Statue of Liberty. Cavalier, anyone?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031979",
