Id. at 36. Beyond that, Ms. [EE “swore on her mother’s grave” that she\nand Mr. Epstein did not engage in sex of any kind. NM Tr. (deposition) at 24. She further\nrepeatedly explained that prior to the time she went to Mr. Epstein’s house (she went there only\nonce), nobody ever tried to coerce her to engage in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein. Not over the\ntelephone, not over the Internet, not at all. {MT r. (deposition) at 31-32. These are not facts\nupon which a federal case can stand.\n\nMs. [BBs age was also unknown to Mr. Epstein when she went to his home. |\n| | who was introduced to Mr. Epstein by Ms] testified in her federal sworn interview\nthat Ms Bko1d her to lie to Epstein. See: Tr. at 8 (“she just said make sure you’re 18\nbecause Jeffrey doesn’t want any underage girls’) (emphasis added). Ms. testimony\nstrongly suggests that Ms. HEMMicd to Mr. Epstein about her own age as well. Ms.\nalso self represented that she worked at a local erotic massage parlor that presumably required a\nminimum age.\n\nThe conduct of re i: likewise illustrative of “mutually corroborating” testimony\n\nwhich supports the fact that this is not an appropriate federal case. In the same way that Ms.\n\nHE as referred to Mr. Epstein and brought to his home without having been introduced or\n\nacquainted in any manner, Ms Mil@lliwas referred by someone else, | who also told\nher to lie to Mr. Epstein about her age, which she did. .. at pp. 8-9).\n\nCEOS seeks to buttress the USAO prosecution by asserting “it is possible to satisfy that\nelement [proof of specific intent as to the age of the alleged victims] with proof that the defendant\nwas deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest that the person was a minor.” (CEOS letter\nat p. 2). Such assertion is counter to the law and to the facts. Reliance on a deliberate ignorance\nstandard as to any of the three statutes in issue requires the factual predicate of an intent not to learn\nof an incriminating fact. This is the antithesis of the factual context of this case where there is\nrepeated proof that the minors believed that they had to lie because Mr. Epstein had an actual\npractice of attempting to verify age, and would not let them in his house if they were under the age of\n18. See United States v. Kennard, 472 F.3d 851, 857-858 (11\" Cir. 2006), quoting, United States v.\nPuche, 350 F.3d 1137, 1149 (11™ Cir. 2003) (An instruction on deliberate ignorance is appropriate\nonly if it is shown [among other things] . . . that the defendant purposely contrived to avoid learning\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012191",
