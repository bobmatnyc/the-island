Okay.\nA. I--+I think the record should be clear,\nI'm -- I'm an attorney and a law professor in Salt Lake\nCity, Utah, and my understanding, he's an attorney here\nin Florida. So I don't ordinarily interact with --\nwith, you know, attorneys in Florida, other than the\nones that I'm interacting with on -- on this case.\nMR.

SIMPSON:\nQ._ -- did -- didn't you testify yesterday that\nthe fact that Mr. Josefsberg's firm had filed a\n\ncomplaint against Miss Roberts, who is also your client,\n\nto be significant to your evaluation of the case?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQQ. And if it -- if that was significant to\nevaluation of the case, why are you telling us you don't\nnormally talk with attorneys in Florida? Doesn't he\nrepresent -- at one point, represent the same client?\n\nA. Right.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n185\n\nQ. And so wouldn't it be natural for you to be\nspeaking with -- at Jleast within the realm of something\none might expect for you to speak?\n\nA. If I were a solo representative of Virginia\nRoberts, that would be the case, but I think you're\nobviously aware that I have co-counsel on this case, and\nthere are other attorneys who are also participating in\nthis matter.\n\nSo I think it would be obvious that if\nthere's a division of labor, it might not be along the\nlines that you're suggesting. And I can't go any\nfurther without going into work product and other issues\nsurrounding Miss Roberts’ representation.\n\nQ. Has Mr. Boies ever told you that he believes\nMiss Roberts was mistaken in her accusations against\nProfessor Dershowitz?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Same objection. Same\ninstruction.\n\nMS.

McCAWLEY: Objection.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Same objection. Same\n\ninstruction.\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Prior to December 30th of 2014, had you\npersonally reviewed any of the flight logs that had been\nreferred to in the testimony in this case?\n\nA. All right?\n\nQ. My only question is whether you personally\nreviewed them.\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. What flight logs have you reviewed; how would\nyou describe them?\n\nA. Both Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2 that were shown\nto Mr. Dershowitz yesterday.\n\nQ. If -- I believe those were Exhibits 6 and\n7--\n\nA. Okay.\n\nQ. — -- but can we agree that flight logs were\nmarked as exhibits?\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n187\n\nA. Right. The two composite exhibits of flight\nlogs I had examined previously.\n\nQ. Okay. So the same documents that Professor\nDershowitz was shown at his deposition; is that right?\n\nA. That's my recollection, yes.\n\nQ. Okay. When did you review those?\n\nA. So one of the reviews was in May 2014. There\nmay have also been an earlier review at an earlier ~~\nearlier time, but I definitely remember reviewing them\nin May -- approximately May 2014.\n\nQ. Would -- do you -- isn't it true that those\nflight logs support Professor Dershowitz's testimony\nthat he was never on a plane with Virginia Roberts?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. How do they not? What is -- what is the\nexplanation for your conclusion in that regard?\n\nA. Right. We talked about this yesterday, so\nI'll incorporate to speed things up some of the\ntestimony that I gave yesterday.\n\nWhat the flight logs showed was, to my mind,\nevidence of potential doctoring, evidence of -- of\nselective presentation of evidence. Mr. Dershowitz had\npresented to a law enforcement agency, at their request,\napparently what I understood to be the -- the -- I\nunderstood that he had been requested by a law\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\nPage 184 to 187 of 335\n\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010849",
