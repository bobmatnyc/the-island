If Russian intelligence\nwere willing to opportunistically accept the delivery of U.S. secrets\nfrom an unknown espionage source that it neither recruited nor\ncontrolled, such as Hanssen, it would obviously have little hesitancy\nin acquiring the secrets that Snowden had stolen of his own volition,\neven if Snowden had acted for idealistic reasons.\n\nIf Russian intelligence focused its search pattern on disgruntled\nAmerican intelligence workers, such as Ames, it is plausible that it\nspotted Snowden through his Internet rants against U.S. surveil-\nlance. Even if it had missed Snowden in Hawaii, a disgruntled former\ncivilian employee at the NSA would have received its full attention\nafter he contacted Russian officials in Hong Kong. While the tactics\nof the SVR might have changed since Cherkashin retired, its objec-\ntives remained the same. And the NSA remained its principal target.\nNor is there any reason to doubt that it still measures success in its\n\n© ability to obtain, by whatever means, the secret sources and methods ®\nof its adversaries. Snowden was in a position, with both the docu-\nments he had taken and the knowledge he had in his head, to deliver\nthe KGB such a coup.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r.indd 264 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019752",
