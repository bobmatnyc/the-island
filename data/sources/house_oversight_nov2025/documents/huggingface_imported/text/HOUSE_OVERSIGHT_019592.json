Because his case involved national security secrets, he had also\nto consider that the Hong Kong court could deny him any use of the\nInternet until his extradition case was settled. If Snowden wanted to\nleave Hong Kong, he had to act swiftly.\n\nTibbo, although evasive on the point when I interviewed him,\nmight not have known about the escape Harrison was planning. He\ndid not know that Snowden’s other alternatives were not good. He\nhad no money, and his credit card had been blocked. He had no visas\nto go to any other country, and Interpol would issue its own border\nalert as soon as the United States filed its charges. At that point,\nHong Kong airport authorities would be officially notified and could\nprevent him from leaving the city. Even if he somehow got out, he\nwould be an international fugitive. Tibbo counseled Snowden to seek\nredress in the Hong Kong courts.\n\nSnowden, though, had no intention of allowing himself to be\n\n® arrested, Despite what he had told Lana Lam only one week earlier, ©\nat least for publication, about his determination to seek justice in\nthe Hong Kong courts, he had not planned to use Hong Kong as\nanything more than a temporary stopover on his escape route. Two\nmonths later and safely in Moscow, he made this point clear in a\nlengthy interview with Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guard-\nian. He told him that it had never been part of his plan to use Hong\nKong to escape the legal consequences of his act. “The purpose of my\nmission [to Hong Kong] was to get the information to journalists.”\nIf so, he had merely been using Tibbo, Man, and Ho to provide him\nwith temporary cover while, following the instructions of Assange,\nHarrison laid down the smoke screen for his escape to Moscow.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 104 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019592",
