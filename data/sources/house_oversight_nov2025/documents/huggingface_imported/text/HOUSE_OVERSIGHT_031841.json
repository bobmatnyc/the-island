  "text": "reasonable and realistic leaders should have nothing to fear from\nEgypt, with which it has an enduring peace treaty.\n\nThe situation with Syria may not be exactly the same, however,\nespecially when the two countries are still officially in a state of war.\nThe regime of Bashar Assad, and his father before him, would have\nnever started a war with Israel unilaterally. It also suited them not to\nhave a peace treaty. Any new Syrian leader is not likely (for a\nconsiderable period of time) to initiate a move toward a peace\nagreement with Israel as this will weaken his position domestically.\nNor will he launch a war, however, since such a war will not result in\nvictory. A democratic regime in Syria, or any other Arab country for\nthat matter, will need a good 10 years to build democratic institutions\nand stabilize a modern market economy needed in any democracy.\nSo, war won’t be on the agenda in the near future.\n\nProsperity increases the public’s stake in a stable economy, and this\nwill make people want to compromise to make their country more\nprosperous and stable. However, everything will depend on how\nprepared the free world is to help new democracies in the Middle\nEast survive and prosper. Small Islamic groups, organized and armed\nwith religious zeal, could hijack power from the moderates. This\nwould lead to a disaster for the whole region. Therefore, it 1s\nimperative for the free world, Israel included, not to leave matters to\nchance. A proactive stance is needed to nurture democracy and help\nmoderate forces organize themselves in order to govern the region\n\nHamid Alkifaey is a writer and journalist. He was the first government\nspokesman in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq and is founder-leader of the\nMovement for Democratic Society. Currently he is researching\ndemocratization at the University of Exeter in the U_K.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031841",
