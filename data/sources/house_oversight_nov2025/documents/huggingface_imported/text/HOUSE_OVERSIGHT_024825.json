  "text": "COWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\n\nWhile we are keen to gain more insights into the evolving use of CBD in the coming\nmonths from our survey work, this initial snapshot offers a framework for sizing the\nultimate CBD opportunity. With growing consumer awareness, we conservatively\nbelieve that CBD use can grow to 10% of adults in the U.S., or ~25 mm consumers (using\ncurrent population) by 2025. If we assume that the average consumer ultimately spends\n$640 per year (or less than $2 / day), that would imply a $16 bn market opportunity for\nCBD. We would note that using the U.S. Census 18+ population projection in 2025, a\n10% incidence rate would equate to just over $590 in annual spend to achieve $16 bn.\nConversely, holding the $640 in spend constant with the U.S. Census forecasted\npopulation would result in over $17 bnin revenues by 2025.\n\n2\n\nThat said, we view this estimate as somewhat conservative, as we can envision a\nscenario where a consumer that uses a CBD tincture or capsule, may also be inclined to\nconvert his or her beauty regimen to include CBD (e.g., CBD infused beauty products),\nand or use a topical for targeted relief as well. Our $16 bn estimate assumes the\nfollowing category contributions:\n\nFigure 3 We Believe CBD Can Be a $16 BN Revenue Opportunity in the U.S. by 2025\n\nNUTRACEUTICALS\n$6,400\n\nTOPICALS\n$4,000\n\nS16BN\n\nCBD REVENUE\nOPPORTUNITY\n\nSe\n\nBEAUTY\n$1,120\n\nBEVERAGES\n$2,400\n\nNote: $ in mm unless otherwise stated.\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nCOWEN.COM 9\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024825",
