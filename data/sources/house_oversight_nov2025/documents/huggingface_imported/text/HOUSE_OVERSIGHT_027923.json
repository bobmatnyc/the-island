  "text": "After my return in June 1963, Avraham asked me to share my experiences\nwith the other sayeret officers. I began with the positives. I singled out the sense\nof self-confidence, allied with individual strength and teamwork, that the French\ncommandos had developed from exposure to almost incredible extremes of\ndanger. I believed that their success depended not on eliminating risk. We all\nknew that was impossible. It was about professionalism developed over a period\nof years by men who had served together in the toughest of circumstances. But I\nalso mentioned their darker side, which seemed to me a reminder of the danger\nof the misapplication of the very qualities which made them a formidable\nmilitary force. “The ethos of a unit like theirs, and like ours, is essential to\nmaking us strong,” I said. “But what I saw in France was an entire ecosystem\nthat these guys had created, extremely patriotic in their own minds, reinforced\nby one another. But dangerous for society as a whole.”\n\nIt would be nearly a decade before Sayeret Matkal became not just a military\nintelligence unit, but a fighting force, and I would turn out to have a central role\nin making that happen. But there was an almost equally daunting challenge we\nwere called on to tackle first — a critical one, if Israel was going to be truly\nprepared in the case of a further war. For while our bugging missions on the\nGolan had reduced our vulnerability to a surprise attack in the north, the real\nchallenge of Rotem had yet to be addressed. It was Egypt — with its hundreds of\nbattle tanks, and hundreds of thousands of men under arms — that was by far our\nmost powerful Arab enemy. President Nasser wasted no opportunity to flaunt\nhis determination to fight, defeat and ultimately erase the state of Israel. But we\nstill had no reliable, real-time intelligence on his forces.\n\nFixing that, if such an operation was even possible, would make our bugging\noperations on the Golan look like mere boy-scout missions. We could not\nsimply walk into Egypt with our backpacks, find a telephone pole on one of the\nfew roads crossing the vast expanse of desert, and attach a bugging device. The\nidea was to tap into the main military communications cable in the Sinai. That\nmeant using a vastly more powerful, and far bulkier, intercept apparatus,\nweighing more than half a ton. Even getting it into Egypt would be a problem.\nWe certainly couldn’t carry it our backpacks, or tow it across the sand. Even if\nwe figured a way to get it there, we would still have to dig up the Egyptian\n\n15\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027923",
