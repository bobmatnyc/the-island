Every society in the world contains its own divides, just\nlike America's culture and subcultures. Because HIV/AIDS functions along the very\ntaboo, very culturally-influenced axis of sexuality, it throws taboo cultural sexual divides\ninto high relief.\n\nIn America, one thing the disease's advent served to highlight was stigma towards\nLGBTQ and other radical sexual subcultures. American HIV mitigation has often sought\nto redress that stigma. Here, one thing it serves to highlight -- one thing mitigation seeks\nto redress -- is mainstream gender and relationship issues. But these splits existed before\nHIV came along. Although the prevalence of HIV sheds light on and invokes compassion\nfor these divisions, they're more enduring than we like to think.\n\nStill, I can't help noticing the phoenixes arising from these ashes. Firstly, it turns out that\nthe best way to shut down sex-negative arguments against explicit sex education is to\ninvoke the specter of HIV. One 2008 report from a well-respected local organization\nargued that AIDS prevention efforts should include straightforward lessons on\npleasurable acts, such as oral sex or sex toy usage! (Obviously, I hope to work with this\norganization.)\n\nA 2004 New York Times Magazine article on HIV in southern Africa made the case that\nwhile \"many experts contend that sexual-behavior change in Africa is complicated\nbecause women's fear of abusive partners inhibits private discussions of sex, condom use\nand HIV,\" the crisis also contributes to a better environment for those discussions. One\nresearcher is quoted pointing out that, \"young South Africans are much more likely to\ntalk about sex and are developing 'a vocabulary for discussing feelings and desires.”\nFurthermore, southern African movements for women's empowerment invariably cite\nHIV as a reason change is necessary now. Because gender oppression is acknowledged as\na driver of the epidemic, gender equality is an explicit goal of both governments and\nmajor HIV organizations. Even admirably reasonable laws about sex work are being\ndiscussed -- considerably more reasonable than most Western sex work legislation. The\nlaws probably won't pass, unfortunately, but at least they're on the radar.\n\nI've got a twisted confession to make. On days when I feel particularly flippant, I find\nmyself thinking: Thank God for HIV/AIDS! Without HIV... would women's\nempowerment be such a given? Aside from bleeding heart feminists like myself, who\nwould care about sex workers' conditions? Aside from sex-positive nuts like myself, who\nwould advocate for explicit sex education?\n\nHere's hoping we can create better social conditions to arrest the pandemic... and keep\nthose conditions going afterwards.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018593",
