When I was with him yesterday I told him we were going to caribbean and he asked where.. He has an island in
bahamas, making you two the only people I know who own islands.. :) will ask him if he is free then. He is
remarkable in new movie, though the film itself is not fantastic.. he is also a pretty good guitarist.. his show
with alice cooper and joe perry in la was great.
