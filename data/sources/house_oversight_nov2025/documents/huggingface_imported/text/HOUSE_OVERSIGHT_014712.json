The only way to recover the compute\npower of the company is to manually shut down each server, some of which are in remote\nlocations.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHow might the possibility of such inadvertent scenarios with the use of resources be addressed ina\nproactive manner, as part of design and implementation of Al systems? What methods, including\nhigh-level monitoring and control, might employed? How might such approaches apply to related\nconcerns with long-term futures of Al?\n\n16\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014712",
