  "text": "leave the union. The US should help Turkey and Baghdad resovlve their issues.\nPortraying Turkey as a model and Iraq as a bad guy is counter productive. Turkey\nis trying to undermine Shia role in Iraq.\n\nJS: External forces will affect Iraq. We need to keep incentives for all parties to\nkeep country together.\n\nMO: Iraq is most vulnerable to Iran when it is weak and divided and we haven’t\ndone enough to help Iraq. Iraqi’s are worried that an Assad exit will push Iran to\ndouble down on Iraq.\n\nJS: limit Iran’s influence on Iraq by isolating Iran in region. Reducing Iran’s\nincluence in region 1s key. But Iraq also has to get its act together and be more\ncohesive. President has made a big bet on Erdogan and Turkey.\n\nScowcroft: What are Turkey’s objectives in Iraq?\n\nSteinberg: Kurd separation is their focus. Building a relationship with Iraqi Kurds\nis aroute for Turkey. They don’t like NAM and Shia — sunni split plays a role in\nTurkey’s attitude towards Iraq.\n\nMO: Turkey sees Iraq and Iraqi Kurds as a source of energy. Turkey doesn’t\nnecessarily like the idea of an indep. Kurdish state. Also comments that there are\nlimits to Iran’s influence in Iraq. Sadr is becoming an Iraqi nationalist. He wants to\nget rid of NAM. Fluid political dynamics in Iraq. Iran cannot determine outcomes\nin Iraq.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025799",
