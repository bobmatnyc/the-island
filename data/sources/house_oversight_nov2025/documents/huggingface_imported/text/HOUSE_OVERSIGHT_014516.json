Please find a white paper attached. \nRegards, \nAmanda \nThe election of Donald Trump as President is expected to lead to significant tax law changes. The tax changes may come \nin two parts: from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and its related taxes and from comprehensive tax \nreform. Since Republicans will also have majorities in both the House and Senate, such changes could be undertaken \nwithout bipartisan support. Although it is not yet known exactly what the changes will be or when they would be \neffective, we are issuing this Tax Alert to inform you of changes that are anticipated, based on proposals made during \nthe campaign by both President-elect Trump and the House Republicans. We also discuss how these changes may \nimpact your planning, both currently and in the future. \nBank of America Merrill Lynch does not provide tax, accounting, regulatory or legal advice.
