And you can have sexual relations with a minor (under 18) until\nyour 24th birthday.\n\n‘Females for JE': Disturbing log of telephone calls from schoolchildren found in sex den of Duke's billionaire friend\n\nBy Stephen Wright <<http:/Awww.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=y &authornamef=Stephen+Wright>\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=y &authornamef=Stephen+Wright>\n\nLast updated at 6:30 PM on 9th March 2011\n\nDetails of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily Mail uncovered logs of telephone\nmessages left at his Florida child sex den.\n\nSchoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages for the 58-year-old billionaire friend of\nPrince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex offences.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is named in several messages.\nDisturbing: Messages were found in Florida home of Jeffrey Epstein, left. The billionaire, 58, is a friend of Prince Andrew, right\nIn one left for her or ‘Sarah’, a caller says she ‘doesn’t know at what time she must come this night for the massage’.\n\nOther messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, contain such phrases as: ‘She has females for Mr JE’ and ‘Ihave a\nfemale for him’.\n\nAnother with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: ‘He just did a good one — 18 years. (She spoke\nto me and said, “I love Jeffrey’’)’.\n\nThe long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein’s celebrity friends including the business magnate Donald\nTrump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and magician David Copperfield, referred to as ‘Magic David’.\n\nThe sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein’s massages, many of which were ‘erotic’ and allegedly\ninvolved the abused girls.\n\nThe evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into Epstein and seen yesterday by the\nMail.\n\n<image.png>\n\n<image.png>\n\nLogs: Two of the answer phone messages. Miss Maxwell is asked, right, when a girl should give a massage\n\nOne message left for Epstein reads: ‘She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.’\n\nIt was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted police to Epstein’s abuse.\nAnother note shows that ‘Colleen’ phoned to tell Epstein: “Going into class — will be out in 45 min.’\n\nLast night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers are included in the logs.\n\nOne girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about Epstein.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030231",
