  "text": "282 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\non-camera star of a twenty-hour-long reality show, edited first into\na video and then a full-length documentary, transformed him in the\npublic’s mind into a hero.\n\nIt would be a mistake to assume that the central role he gave\nhimself was simply an exercise in narcissism. After the video was\nreleased, he was no longer a near nonentity servicing a computer\nsystem at a backwater NSA base in Hawaii. He had emerged from\nthe shadowy world of electronic intelligence to become one of the\nmost famous whistle-blowers in modern history. It was a mantle\nthat would allow him to also become a leading advocate of privacy\nand encryption rights, as well as the leading opponent of NSA spy-\ning. While this remarkable transformation might not have been his\nentire motive, it was certainly the result of the choice he made to go\npublic.\n\nThe Fourth Decision\n\n© The final choice he made was to board a nonstop flight to Moscow ®\non June 23.

According\nto one U.S. diplomat cited by The New York Times, China might have\nalready obtained copies of Snowden’s NSA files and did not want the\nproblem of having Snowden defect to Beijing. In any case, if it had\nnot already acquired the files, it could assume it would receive that\nintelligence data from its Russian ally in the intelligence war. What-\never its reason, China did not use its considerable power in Hong\nKong to block Snowden’s exit.\n\nNor did Snowden obtain a visa to any country in Latin America or\nelsewhere during his monthlong stay in Hong Kong. As in the oft-\ncited Sherlock Holmes clue of the dog that did not bark, Snowden’s\nlack of any visas in his passport strongly suggests that he had not\nmade plans to go anyplace but where he actually went: Moscow.
