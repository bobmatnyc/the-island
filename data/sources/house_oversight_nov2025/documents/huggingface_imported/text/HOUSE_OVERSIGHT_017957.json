For example, Ransome’s first\ncontact with any of Roberts’ lawyers was in November 2016, and at least as early\nas October 2016 Ransome had identified Dershowitz in writing to a reporter as\nsomeone who had had sex with one or more of the girls provided by Epstein and\nthat Epstein had arranged for Dershowitz to be Ransome’s lawyer.\n\n82. After settling the case against him brought by Messrs. Edwards and Cassell,\nDershowitz told the media he had been vindicated, while at the same time insisting that the term\nof the settlement remains confidential. Edwards and Cassell responded: “Following the\nannouncement of the settlement of defamation claims against Alan Dershowitz, he has been\nmaking public statements suggesting that he has prevailed in the lawsuit and that the terms of the\nsettlement exonerate him of any wrongdoing. Those statements are at best misleading. It is a\nmistake for anyone to conclude based upon Mr. Dershowitz’s statements that the case against\nhim was abandoned due to lack of factual support. It is a mistake for anyone to conclude based\nupon Dershowitz’s statements that Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell had determined that the\nallegations against Alan Dershowitz made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre were false or unfounded.\nNeither the terms of settlement nor the agreed upon joint public statement issued as part of the\nsettlement support any such conclusion and it is false to state or suggest otherwise.” Dershowitz\nSettles Sex Case, But is He Vindicated?
