Draconian laws protect this secrecy.\n\nIn the first week of June 2013, the NSA learned that there had\nbeen a massive breach. Thousands of secret files bearing on com-\nmunications intelligence had been stolen from a heavily guarded\nregional base in Oahu, Hawaii.\n\nThe suspect was Edward Snowden, a twenty-nine-year-old civil-\nian analyst at that base, who had fled to Hong Kong before the\nbreach was discovered. According to a three-count criminal com-\nplaint filed by federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Vir-\nginia, Snowden had stolen government property and violated the\nEspionage Act by the unauthorized and willful communication of\nnational defense information to an unauthorized person. He also\nlikely violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by entering com-\nputer systems illicitly.\n\nThis was not a whodunit mystery. On June 9, 2013, in an extraor-\ndinary twelve-minute video made in a cramped hotel room in Hong\nKong, Snowden identified himself as the person who had taken the\n\n© NSA documents.

He had also stolen secret documents from the\nNSA, the CIA, the Department of Defense, and the British cipher\nservice revealing the sources and methods they employed in their\nmonitoring of adversaries, which was their job.\n\nBy the time the theft had been discovered, in the first week of\nJune 2013, it was impossible for the FBI, a grand jury, or any other\nU.S. agency to question him because he had fled the country.
