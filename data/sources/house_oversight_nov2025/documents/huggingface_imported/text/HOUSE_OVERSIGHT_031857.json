  "text": "24\n\nWhile Ankara may answer anti-Turkish demonstrations in Libya by\nclosing down the Turkish embassy in Tripoli, the first ever such\naction by the diplomatic service throughout its modern history, anti-\nTurkish demonstrations in Damascus can be really costly for Turkey\nnow and in the future.\n\nWhile the personal friendly relations between Assad and his\ncounterpart in Turkey, Erdogan, might provide Turkey a golden\nopportunity to help Syria sail out of the current tumultuous situation.\nOf course at a time when Erdogan himself is after converting Turkey\ninto his sultanate of fear under the aegis of advanced democracy it\nmight be absurd to expect him to advise Assad of a democratic way\nout of the mess in Syria. Yet, as much as Turkey needs to see\nrestoration of peace, security and stability in Syria for domestic\nsecurity reasons as well as for its regional role, Syria and President\nAssad need Turkey and Erdogan to walk the extra mile in reforms\nadvised by them, as the real-politic of the day compels him to do so if\nhe wants to sail out of this problem in one piece.\n\nIf, however, despite Turkey’s democracy and reform preaches, the\nmassacres continue in the Syrian street not only the prestige of\nErdogan in the Arab street will be seriously impaired but sooner or\nlater the fire in the Arab street will have a reflection on the Turkish\nstreets.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031857",
