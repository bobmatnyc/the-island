The Great War was\ngoing to bea charnel house. The continent had built itself into a battle machine,\nwired by trains and telegraphs and armies. There was no reverse gear. There was\nnot even a switch to slow it down, let alone turn it off. A massive, technology-\npowered, fast-moving system with revolutionary implications, built beyond the\ncomprehension of any one figure or nation, had slipped out of control. And the men\nin charge of planning and directing the use of this super-fast complex? They failed\neveryone: their soldiers, their kings, their armies. They were all but insensible to the\nreal nature of their age.\n\nSound familiar?\n2.\n\nHere, then, is a question of the sort - violent, loaded with the possibility of tragedy -\nthat you'd rather not have to consider: A new way of war arrives, a new weapon, a\nfresh idea about fighting. Does it make your world peaceful or treacherous? The\nlethality of the equation of guns x machines at the end of the 19 Century appeared\nto some industrialists and bankers and statesmen inarguable evidence for peace.\nEveryone with such a violently efficient weapon; who dares start a war? As we now\nknow, machines x guns was a formula for some of the worst killing in human history.\nGatling’s fond hope that his weapons would stop war was naive, insane even. His\ncompetitor Maxim had been clearer eyed. A friend told him: “Give up your chemistry\nand electricity. If you want to make a pile of money, invent something that will\nenable those Europeans to cut each others’ throats with greater facility.”227\n\nSo: Let’s be a bit warmer about this. Networks x weapons = what exactly? Is there\nsome disaster lingering in our own future, as unimagined from our current\nperspective as machine guns and trenches were a century ago? Do we consider war\nimpossible now? There’s something sickening in such puzzles, of course. Think of\nthe men and women who, over the millennia, have contemplated similar questions\nknowing full well the answer would be measured in blood and treasure and\nchildren. Put yourself in the place of the population of Melos, a peace-loving\nMediterranean island whose destruction 2300 years ago was chronicled by\nThucydides in The Peloponesian Wars. “Surely you have noticed that you are an\nisland and we control the ocean,” an unwelcome Athenian general intimated to a\nMelian citizens’ council one day 243 BC as his soldiers and ships collected\nmenacingly outside the city’s walls. Athens wanted the Melians to join an alliance\n\n226 “You smug faced”: Seigfried Sassoon, “Suicide in the Trenches” in The War\nPoems of Seigfried Sassoon, (Mineola, N.Y.: Dover Publications, 2004), 64\n\n227 “Give up your chemistry”: John Ellis, A Social History of the Machine Gun (New\nYork: Pantheon, 1975) p.33\n\n154\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018386",
