Peggy \nSiegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her famous friends. Nice work if you can get \nit. \nIn 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for \"Platoon,\" he immediately turned to a domestic arena \nand began working on \"Wall Street\" in New York City where his father had been a stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen \nas a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of \nfinance (as seen through the Hal Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. \nAt the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers from his earlier \n\"Scarface\" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both groups had an animalistic need to obtain \nbig and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and greed. \nOliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud Fox, a kid from \nnowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust into the fast lane with a rock star \nfinancial mentor who teaches him corruption. \nOliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. Michael was not \nknown as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver also saw the anger, confidence, \nsalesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked \nback hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one \ncould ever forget. \nWhen Gekko delivers his speech, \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works,\" cinematic history was \nmade. \n\"Wall Street\" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire financial services \nindustry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. \nFour years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film Entertainment co-\nchairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board pending script approval. Steven Schiff \nwrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered it obsolete. \nAlan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the social rhythms of \nNew York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko 's character was modeled after '70s junk bond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s \nmergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike \nNovogratz, geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko 's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to \ndirect, he rewrote a portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. \nThis past September, Oliver yelled, \"action\" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he emerges from a \nlengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to redefine himself in a different era. The \nNew York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. \nA week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver designs an elaborate \ntracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a young idealistic investment banker \nplayed by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, Moore's fiancee, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an \noff-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032000 \nof Art. Gekko, who used to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. \nThe shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In one take Michael \nmakes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on the set is courteous but quick and tense. \nThere is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. \nI watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff (\"Monsters Ball\") and \nCelia Costas, who was a location manager on the first \"Wall Street.\" They have asked me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene \nand bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture \ngowns. \"Give me the night before the Titanic goes down,\" were his exact words. Not a problem. \nI pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his personal publicist \nwhen he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for \"Wall Street\" and we have remained great friends. Gekko is just as \nchallenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' \nBroadway debut in a \"Little Night Music.\" Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts \nreceived for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. \nI tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him and the \nproduction. \n8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th Street and \nMadison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia \nKoch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial \ntitan husband David is unaware where she is this morning. \nVanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage Geoffrey Beene, \nand Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake flower on his lapel. Costume \nDesigner Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. \nOliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's \"W\"). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a ruthless Wall \nStreet kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their \nhuge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still \nfamous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the '60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and \nreplaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's \nvision. \nAt 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and her friend \nMonique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production assistants fuss over them. \nDebonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate \nwife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, \nHamish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. \nOliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, gives out lines \nto his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too small. Wardrobe \njumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, \"Action.\" The kid plays the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for \nmoney, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours \nlater a PA yells, \"Lunch\". \nIn costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet \"The Harpies,\" including Liz Smith, Barbara \nWalters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. \nGraydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in \"Wall Street 2\" as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon \njokes that he only works with lines. I say, \"Not a problem.\" (This will be news to Oliver.) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032001 \nBack on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. \nOliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron \nsaunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching \nboyfriend Shia work. \nAt sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.) \nChuck Pfieffer plants a \"Page Six\" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. \nThursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street \nOliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner. \nSpontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing \nhimself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. \nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway \nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the \nAlzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. \nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join \nPrince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly \nKlein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer \nLawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia \nTaylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. \nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at \nbreak neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa \nwith a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are \nalternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of \nexcitement. \nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins. \nCharlie has been flown in from LA for half a days work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor \ncommanding two million dollars an episode of \"Two and a Half Men.\" \nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the \ncamera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their \nconcentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an \neasy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and \nmy marriage has become a threesome. \nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with \nSusan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each \nother turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. \nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and \nNatalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in \nthe film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032002 \nagent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. \nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me \nto a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations. \nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince \nDimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered \nchampagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and \nShia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between \ntakes. \nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and \nLord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown. \nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and \ninstructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not \nuse American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as \nevery VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. \nAt last, \"It's a wrap\" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of electrifying \nglamour,\" and \"the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\" \nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting \nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro \nwith wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to \ndinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural \nenvironment. \nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens \non the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is \nfinally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the \nshop for a cut and the banter begins about the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" \nlike his famous do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\" \nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across the street. The \nunit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. Michael comes out, and the press \nthink they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run \nthe next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver Stone's surprise endings. \nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and its got hit written all over it. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
