When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before\nhim. what would you like me to tell Barry?\n\nThere is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i\noutlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you\nlike ). Brad wechsler was never up to the task . sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a\nlong time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and\nTom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2\npeople. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get\nhim ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, | He complained for over a year , re his\ndirection by eileen and ada , and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of\nwarnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told\nyou he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for\nme and that brad needs to pays him .\n\n. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. :\n\nI have taken heat for years over the fact that 1 gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up\n\nquestions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. (that was Eileen _) but\nsomehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . —_ when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you\nbellowed. that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect\nyou from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out\nthat he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really\ndangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no\nresponsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!! , your response was that was my opinion\nwas only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he\ntoo is still there, and a waste of money and space.\n\nMy time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign\nfunds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re\nmy time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and\nmake any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess.\n\nThat being said, the tasks at hand are the following.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023341",
