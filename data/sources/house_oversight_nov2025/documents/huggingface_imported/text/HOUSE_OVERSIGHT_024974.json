Surely ElBaradei knows this.\nNonetheless, “The Age of Deception” provides the grist for serious\ndebate even as it helpfully chronicles the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency’s journey and tribulations as it evolved from a\nrelatively obscure group of technicians into an organization with\ngrowing international clout. But if those following in ElBaradei’s\npath think they can combat proliferation without the major powers —\nparticularly the United States — assuming a central role, they are\nwrong. Checking proliferation will require more innovative and\ntighter cooperation between the agency ElBaradei loves and the\nUnited States, of which he no longer seems especially fond.\n\nLeslie H. Gelb is president emeritus of the Council on Foreign\n\nRelations, a former senior official in the State and Defense\nDepartments, and a former New York Times columnist.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024974",
