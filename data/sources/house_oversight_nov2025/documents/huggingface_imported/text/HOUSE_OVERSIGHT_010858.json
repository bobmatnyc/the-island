LIthink that there are -- there is\ninformation along those lines in the police report, yes.\n\nQ. Okay. And so do you acknowledge that the\npolice report, on its face, reflects both reports of\nmassages that involved improper sexual contact --\ncontact and massages that were perfectly legitimate?\n\nA. Yes, but not in the same proportion.\n\nQ. My question wasn't proportion. The -- the\nreport on its face, you understood, reflected that there\nwere massages given at Mr. Epstein's residence that were\nperfectly legitimate?\n\nA. Some -- it was basically a few isolated\nexamples from what I could see,\n\nQ. So you would characterize what was said in\nthe police report as \"a few isolated examples\"?\n\nA. Well, given the backdrop that they had --\n\nQ. No. My question -- it's a yes or no\nquestion. Is that how you would characterize it?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. The witness is not\nconfined to answering yes or no, if yes or no\nwould be misleading.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n221\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. It's a different position than was taken\npreviously, but --\n\nA. Imean, I was just going to give one\nsentence, and the one sentence would be, in the context\nof this whole police report where they had 24,\napproximately, minor girls who were -- who were being\nsexually abused, the references to legitimate massages I\nwould view as isolated.\n\nQ. So you're coming to the conclusion, looking\nat the police report, that they are isolated; is that\nright?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. And do you think a fair-minded reader of the\npolice report would reach that conclusion?\n\nA. Absolutely.\n\nQ. And were you aware that the police report, to\ngive a bit more detail, reflected that a woman who was\ndescribed as having tattoos was hired to give\ndeep-tissue Swedish massages. Do you recall that being\nin the -- in the police report?\n\nA. Something along those lines, yes.\n\nQ. And she also -- that woman also told the\npolice that she was not Jeffrey Epstein's type, that she\nwasn't thin, had tattoos, didn't fit his type?\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n01:23:34\n\n01:23:37\n\n01:23:40\n\n01:23:40\n\n01:23:42\n\n01:23:44\n\n01:23:47\n\n01:23:50\n\n01:23:54\n\n01:23:57\n\n01:23:58\n\n04:24:01\n\n04:24:01\n\n01:24:04\n\n01:24:04\n\n01:24:05\n\n01:24:07\n\n01:24:09\n\n01:24:09\n\nOt:24:11\n\n01:24:14\n\n04:24:15\n\n01:24:18\n\n01:24:19\n\n01:24:24\n\n04:24:25\n\n01:24:25\n\n01:24:31\n\n04:24:31\n\n01:24:34\n\n04:24:35\n\n01:24:41\n\n01:24:49\n\n01:24:54\n\n04:25:04\n\n04:25:07\n\n01:26:13\n\n01:25:16\n\n04:25:18\n\n01:25:21\n\n01:25:22\n\n01:25:26\n\n01:25:30\n\n01:25:32\n\n04:26:36\n\n01:25:38\n\n04:25:42\n\n01:25:45\n\n04:25:47\n\n01:26:03\n\nON OD OH & WwW Dh <a\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\nOn OD Om WD =\n\n©\n\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n222\n\nA.

And she's over the age of 18, which is\nanother reason why wouldn't fit his type, so...\n\nQ. But you acknowledge that -- that this\nwoman -- that the police report reflects a woman over --\nwell over the age of 18, being hired to give perfectly\nlegitimate massages, correct?\n\nA. Yeah. That was cover for the sex trafficking\nthat was going on.\n\nQ. Okay. So you're now -- does the police\nreport say \"it was cover\" --\n\nA. That was --\n\nQQ. -- \"for the sex trafficking\"?\n\nA.

Do you consider yourself a conspira -- having\na conspiratorial view?\n\nA. Absolutely not.\n\nQ. Do you consider yourself a crusader?\n\nA. Well, crusader for justice, I would say, yes.\n\nQ. If -- let me put it this way: In your view,\nis evidence that a person, any person, any guest at\nMr. Epstein's house had a massage, evidence that that\nperson engaged in criminal sexual conduct, contact with\nminors, because of the fact of having a massage?\n\nA. You'd have to look at the context.\n\nQ. On its own, is it any evidence -- doesn't\nit -- is it any evidence at all, in your view?\n\nA. It would be some evidence, yes.\n\nQ. Notwithstanding that the report, on its face,\nreflects both legitimate and illegitimate massages?\n\nA. The report on its face, let's be clear,\nreflects a lot of illegitimate sag -- massages anda\nsporadic or isolated, you know, legitimate massages. So\nthe fact that somebody gets a massage in that context,\nI-- I think is -- is -- raises, you know, the concerns\nwe have been talking about.\n\nQ.
