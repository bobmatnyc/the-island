The NSA moved to\nmitigate the damage and find new ways of obtaining unexpected intelligence. In June 2014, the\nnew NSA director Admiral Michael Rogers had to confront flagging morale that, according to\nformer director Michael Hayden, was near-paralyzing the intelligence service. Admiral Rogers\nrecognized that as a direct result of the Snowden breach “the nation has lost capabilities against\nadversaries right now who are attempting to actively undermine us.\" But even with that loss, he\nobserved “the sky has not fallen.” As in the Chicken Little fable he cited, the world had not\nended for the NSA. Nor had it ended for the multi-billion out-sourcing enterprise it\nsuperintended. The NSA may have lost many of its sources, or “capabilities,” but Rogers held out\nhope that new sources could be eventually found to replace them. Compromised codes, after all,\ncould be changed. New technological methods could be devised. New vulnerabilities also could\nbe targeted in enemy territories. Although repairing the damage might take many “decades.”\naccording to Michael McConnell, the Vice Chairman of Booz Allen, the new director had to get\non with that task. McConnell, a former NSA director himself, pointed out that the NSA\nDirector’s “first responsibility is to be the chief cheerleader.\" Rebuilding the NSA capabilities\nassumed, however, that there would not be another Snowden-size breach.\n\nThe question remained: how could the NSA’s vaunted secrecy have been so deeply penetrated\nby a mere analyst-in-training at a regional base in Oahu? The perpetrator himself could not be\nasked. He was in Moscow, supposedly employed by an unnamed Russian cyber security firm. He\nwas also in his Moscow interviews pointing to the “incompetence” of the NSA. All that was\nknown for certain about the young man who had taken the “queen” from the board was that he\nhad gained entry to the NSA’s secret chambers through the back door, a portal opened to him by\nthe NSA’s reliance on outside contractors.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020313",
