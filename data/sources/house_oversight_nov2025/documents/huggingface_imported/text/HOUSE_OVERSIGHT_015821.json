  "text": "Knowledge 131\n\nEasy!\n\nNo, unfortunately. The problem is subtler than it first appears. First\nit will take a VEEEEERRRY long time. If I counted up from one, I would\nprint out War and Peace eventually but it would take 120 billion, billion,\nbillion, billion, billion... (I would need the entire length of this book\nto write out all the billions) years! For the physicists amongst you, I\nwould need 10°” years, assuming I could use every atom in the known\nuniverse counting in parallel at the plank interval. “The plank interval is\nthe shortest time that can exist in the Universe as a discrete ‘tick.\n\nEven going at this speed using with every atom in the known\nUniverse would take 10°° longer than the age of the Universe. This is\nstupendously long. Remember scientific notation means I have a 1 with\n5000 zeroes after it. It is a deceptive notation as something as innocuous\nas 10'”° is equal to the number of atoms in the known universe. 10° is\nan absolutely enormous number. If you hear something is going to ‘take\nuntil the end of time; we're talking a lot longer than that!\n\nYou may have spotted that in the process of counting up to the War\nand Peace number we also count through EVERY book ever written\nshorter than 500,000 words in all the world’s languages. Interestingly we\ncounted through the Japanese and Chinese translations of War and Peace\nquite a bit before we reached the English and finally French translations.\nDuring the process, we also stepped through countless other wonderful\nworks: proofs of amazing theorems, the complete works of William\nShakespeare, and every composition ever written. Sadly, we never knew\nit. The problem is my program never stopped and told me it had found\nany of these wonderful things. I would have to sit staring at the screen to\nspot them. If I was off doing something else — making a cup of tea, taking\nthe kids to school - I would miss all these wonders; the program never\ntells me if it has succeeded, but quietly prints out War and Peace and\ncarries on. This is really annoying. It’s not a useful machine.\n\nWhat I need is a machine that rings a bell when it finds something\ninteresting so I can break away from what I am doing and take a look.\nReading every book it writes in every language and all the nonsense\nin between would take a ginormous amount of my time. (By-the-way,\ncontrary to statements by school teachers that ginormous is not a word\n\n— it is!) I want a computer to come up with War and Peace without me\nhaving to do all the work.\n\nIt’s no help if the machine writes everything down and lets me take\na look in my own good time. That only puts off the time when I have to\nbegin reading all the gibberish it produced. Another practical problem\nis the massive storage required. Just imagine the immense piles of printer\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015821",
