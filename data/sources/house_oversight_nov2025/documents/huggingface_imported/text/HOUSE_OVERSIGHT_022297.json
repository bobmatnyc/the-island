First,\nrather than say that the union may not\n“threaten you that you will lose your\njob,” a more comprehensive statement\nwould be “threaten, harass, or coerce\nyou in order to gain your support for the\nunion.’ The Board agrees, except as\nregards “‘harass,” which is sometimes\nused to characterize almost any sort of\nunion solicitation. Accordingly, the\nstatement will be modified to read\n“threaten or coerce you in order to gain\nyour support for the union.”’ Second,\nthe comment suggests changing “‘cause\nor attempt to cause an employer to\ndiscriminate against you” to\n“discriminate or attempt to discriminate\nagainst you because you don’t support\na union.” The Board disagrees, because\nthe suggested change would shift the\nfocus of the provision away from the\nsort of conduct contemplated in the\ntule. See NLRA Section 8(b)(2), 29\nU.S.C. 158(b)(2). Third, the comment\nsuggests changing “‘take other adverse\naction against you based on whether\nyou have joined or support the union”\nto “take adverse action against you\nbecause you have not joined or do not\nsupport the union.’ The Board agrees\nand will modify this provision of the\nnotice accordingly.\n\nBaker & McKenzie urges that a variety\nof other examples of unlawful union\nconduct be added to the notice,\nincluding requiring nonmembers to pay\na fee to receive contract benefits,\ndisciplining members for engaging in\nactivity adverse to a union-represented\ngrievant, disciplining members for\nrefusing to engage in unprotected\nactivity, engaging in careless grievance\nhandling, failing to notify employees of\ntheir Beck rights, requiring employees to\nagree to dues checkoff instead of direct\npayment, discriminatorily applying\nhiring hall rules, and conditioning\ncontinued employment on the payment\nof a fine or dues in “‘right-to-work’”’\nstates.\n\n109 See comment of National Association of\nManufacturers.\n110 See comment of ALFA.\n\nAs with the examples of unlawful\nemployer activity, the Board concludes\nthat the provisions concerning unlawful\nunion activity, as proposed, are accurate\nand informative, and, as with the notice\nas a whole, strike an appropriate\nbalance between being simultaneously\ninstructive and succinct. Moreover, the\nBoard finds it unnecessary to include\nadditional examples of unlawful\nconduct so that the lists of employer\nand union activity are the same length\nbecause the notice describes the central\nforms of unlawful conduct engaged in\nby each type of entity. Still less is it\nnecessary to add a host of additional\nexamples of unlawful union conduct,\nwith the result that the list of such\nconduct would be much longer than the\nlist of unlawful employer conduct. In\nthe Board’s view, the list of unlawful\nunion conduct in the proposed notice\nfairly informs employees of the types of\nconduct that a union is prohibited from\nengaging in without providing\nunnecessary or confusing examples.\nEmployees may contact the NLRB if\nthey believe a union has violated the\nNLRA.\n\ne. Collective-Bargaining Provision\n\nThe collective-bargaining provision of\nthe NPRM states that “if you and your\nco-workers select a union to act as your\ncollective bargaining representatives,\nyour employer and the union are\nrequired to bargain in good faith and in\na genuine effort to reach a written,\nbinding agreement setting your terms\nand conditions of employment. The\nunion is required to fairly represent you\nin bargaining and enforcing the\nagreement.” 75 FR 80419.\n\nThe Board received only a few\ncomments on this provision of the\nnotice. Notably, COLLE requests the\ninclusion of a limitation on the\nprovision that employees have the right\nto bargain collectively, in order to\nclarify that the employer’s obligation is\nonly to bargain in good faith and not\nnecessarily to reach an agreement. A\nsecond comment suggests that the\nnotice inform employees that they have\nthe right to “sue a union for unfairly\nrepresenting the employee in\nbargaining, contract administration, or a\ndiscrimination matter.”\n\nThe Board has decided that no\nchanges are necessary to the duty to\nbargain paragraph. The Board is\nsatisfied that the proposed collective-\nbargaining provision provides sufficient\nguidance to employees about the\nexercise of these rights while still\nstaying within the constraints set by a\nnecessarily brief employee notice. As to\nthe first comment, the notice states that\nan employer and union have a duty to\n\n“bargain in good faith and in a genuine\neffort to reach a written, binding\nagreement.” As discussed above, by\nreferring to a “genuine effort’ to reach\nagreement, the notice necessarily\nimplies that the parties are not obliged\nto actually reach one. The duty to\nbargain in good faith has many\ncomponents. See NLRB v. Katz, 369 U.S.\n736 (1962). And the suggestion that\nemployers do not have to agree to\ncertain proposals, although correct, does\nnot account for the line of cases that\nsuggest that an important ingredient in\ngood faith bargaining is a willingness to\ncompromise. See Phelps Dodge, 337\nNLRB 455 (2002).\n\nTurning to the suggestion that the\nnotice include language informing\nemployees of their right to “sue” the\nunion if it fails to represent them fairly,\nthe Board has concluded that the notice\nsufficiently apprises employees of their\nright to fair representation and of their\nright to file unfair labor practice charges\nwith the Board should a union fail to\nfulfill that duty. The rights that\nemployees have to sue unions directly\nin court without coming to the Board\nare beyond the scope of this rulemaking.\n\nf. Coverage Provision\n\nIn regard to coverage under the NLRA,\nthe proposed notice states:\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act covers\nmost private-sector employers. Excluded\nfrom coverage under the NLRA are public-\nsector employees, agricultural and domestic\nworkers, independent contractors, workers\nemployed by a parent or spouse, employees\nof air and rail carriers covered by the Railway\nLabor Act, and supervisors (although\nsupervisors that have been discriminated\nagainst for refusing to violate the NLRA may\nbe covered). 75 FR 80419.\n\nA comment from the National\nImmigration Law Center suggests adding\nthe following language: ““The NLRA\nprotects the above-enumerated rights of\nall employees, irrespective of their\nimmigration status. That protection\nextends to employees without work\nauthorization, though certain remedies\nin those circumstances may be limited.\nEmployers cannot threaten you or\nintimidate you on the basis of you\nimmigration status to prevent you from\njoining or supporting a union, or\nengaging in concerted activity for\nmutual aid and protection.”\n\nThe Board has decided not to amend\nthe coverage provision in the final\nnotice. Although the Board understands\nthat many immigrant employees may be\nunsure whether they are covered by the\nNLRA, the notice does not include a list\nof covered employees. Including\nspecific coverage of immigrants, but not\nother classes of employees, may cause\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022297",
