Iraq was almost\nnever mentioned, nor was 9/11 or al Qaeda, and rather than rail at\nwhat America had imposed on them, the young Arabs instead\ncriticized how America reacted to them. (President Obama’s failure\nto support Egyptian revolutionaries until after Mubarak was clearly a\ngoner, and his inconsistency helping Libya’s rebels, but not Syria’s,\nwere both widely criticized.) By taking control of their own fates, in\nreality and perception—highly important in this prideful culture—the\nconversation has become more respectful and adult.\n\nSo it was that in 2011 I found myself having the kind of dialogue that\nHi, whose funding was pulled in 2005, had always aspired to have.\nOver lunch in the dark basement of Tabouleh, a restaurant in Cairo’s\nGarden City, seven Egyptian bloggers, including many of the digital\nheroes of the Tahrir Square Facebook revolution, debated U.S.\nsubsidies to Egypt. “We don’t want money,” says one blogger, Safa.\n“We want to make sure we go the right way.” No, counters Ahmad,\n“we need the money, but it must be with no strings attached.”\nEventually, the talk turns to nuts-and-bolts democracy, the real\nJefferson-Hamilton stuff (one of the bloggers, Karim, had already\nrequested a translated copy of the Constitution): federalism, the role\nof the military, and, above all, the peaceful transfer of power that\ninspires quadrennial awe worldwide.\n\nSuch technology-fueled enlightenment comes with an equally\nperilous downside, as evidenced by my conspiracy-minded Beirut\ncoffee-shop friend.
