After the SDFL agreed to accommodate your requést, counse/ for Epstein\nbegan taking issue with the methodology of compensation, notification to the victims, and the issues\n\nthat had been previously considered and rejected during negotiations, i.e., that the conduct does not\n\nrequire registration and the contemplated state and federal statutes have no applicability to the instant\nmatter. ,\n\nA. Delay.\n\nThe Agreement required that “Epstein shall use his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. The United States has no objection to Epstein self-\nreporting to begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 2008.” Agreement, pages 4-5,\nparagraph | 1 (emphasis added). After the Agreement was executed, the SDFL accommodated your\nrequest to extend the October 26th plea deadline to November 20\" based upon, what seemed to be,\nreasonable scheduling conflict issues.' By early November, you represented that the presiding state\ncourt judge would not “stagger the plea and sentencing as contemplated in the Agreement.” Although\nthe Agreement clearly did not contemplate a staggered “plea and sentencing,” the SDFL again agreed\nto accommodate Epstein’s request to appear in state court for plea and sentencing on January 4,\n2008.”\n\nt “Accordingly, I have now confirmed with Mr. Epstein's Florida counsel that the state's\nattorney's office and the court will be available to have him enter his plea on November 20. So we will\nplan to proceed on one that date.” October 18, 2007 email from Jay Lefkowitz to USA R. Alexander\nAcosta. °\n\nOn the same day, Mr. Lefkowitz confirmed with First Assistant Jeffrey H. Sloman that this\npostponement “ will not affect when Epstein begins serving his sentence.”\n\nCorrespondence from Jay Lefkowitz to FAUSA Sloman dated November 8, 2007 (“the judge\nhas invited the parties to appear for the plea and sentencing on January 4\", we do not anticipate any delay\nbeyond that date.”)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012200",
