  "text": "Free Will Universe\n\nbelieve we live in a Universe where information comes into existence\n\nthrough the creative endeavors of human beings. When Andrew\n\nWiles discovered his solution to Fermat’s Last Theorem, he did\nsomething a computer cannot do and demonstrated non-computational\nthought. But there is an alternative explanation put forward by the\ndetermined determinists.\n\nDaniel Dennett - the standard bearer for this camp — believes\neverything in the Universe is entirely determined. He argues there is no\nplace in the laws of nature for free will to arise.\n\nBoth sides of the argument agree Turing prohibits a general-\npurpose machine from solving all mathematical problems, but that\nseems to be the extent of agreement. The determinists solve the Wiles\nParadox by arguing he is a special purpose machine, perfectly able to\nfind answers to non-computable problems. The Turing prohibition only\napplies to general purpose machines. Let us run a thought experiment\nto see what sort of Universe we would live in if special purpose machines\nwere the answer to this puzzle.\n\nIfthe Universe is determined, it can be modeled asa single algorithm.\nIf everything in the Universe evolves according to a set of rules, it will\nrun like a giant piece of clockwork or one large computer game. Each\nsolar system, planet, and individual mathematician would evolve along\npreordained lines. Mathematicians would operate as software subroutine\nand would rely on further subroutines to explain the beating of their\nhearts and the way the molecules of their body interact.\n\nIf our Universe were organized in this way:\n\nThis Universe could not discover solutions to arbitrary problems.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016041",
