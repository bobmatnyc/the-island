Edwards represents four of Epstein’s minor victims,\n\nthree of whom have settled their cases with Epstein under a confidential agreement.\n\nEpstein attorneys Christopher Knight and Joseph Ackerman declined to comment Friday on the\ncourt filings.\n\nEdwards deposed Brunel, but his attorney delayed it and then said he was back in France with no\nplans to return. But according to the court papers, Brunel was staying with Epstein in Palm\nBeach during that period.\n\n34\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011945",
