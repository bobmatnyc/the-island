  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54037\n\nBoard rejects both contentions because,\nas explained in the NPRM, the Board\ndoes not have the authority to impose\nfines. 75 FR 80414, citing Republic Steel\nCorp. v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 10-12 (1940).\nAnother comment argues that the Board\nshould not provide remedies for failing\nto post the notice because such\nremedies are not provided under other\nstatutes. In fact, both remedies and\nsanctions are imposed under some\nstatutes; see, e.g., 29 CFR 1601.30 (fine\nof $110 per offense for failing to post\nnotice under Title VII); 29 CFR\n825.300(a)(1) (same sanction for failing\nto post notice under FMLA); cases cited\nabove for tolling of limitation periods\nfor failing to post notices under several\nstatutes.\n\nOne comment contends that the\nproposed remedies were proposed\nsolely as means of deterring failures to\npost the notices, and are therefore\ninappropriate; several other comments\nassert that the proposed remedies are\npunitive.169 Although the Board\ndisagrees, there is language in the\nNPRM that may have inadvertently\nsuggested that the enforcement\nmechanisms were proposed solely for\ndeterrent purposes. The Board wishes to\ncorrect any such misimpression. As\nstated above, in explaining why it was\nproposing those mechanisms, the Board\nstated in its NPRM that it was “mindful\nof the need to identify effective\nincentives for compliance.” 75 FR\n80413. Later, referring to tolling the\n10(b) period and considering a willful\nfailure to post the notice as evidence of\nunlawful motive, the Board said that it\n“proposes the following options\nintended to induce compliance with the\nnotice-posting requirement.” Id. at\n80414. However, the Board made those\nstatements while explaining why it had\ndetermined not to rely entirely on\nemployers’ voluntary compliance with\nthe rule. (The Board had had little\nsuccess in persuading employers to\nvoluntarily post notices of employee\nrights during the critical period leading\nup to a representation election.) Id. By\nnoting that the proposed enforcement\nscheme would have some deterrent\neffect in that context, the Board did not\nmean to imply that it was proposing\nthose measures solely for deterrence\npurposes. For the reasons discussed at\nlength above, the Board has found that\nfinding a failure to post the notices to\nviolate Section 8(a)(1) and, in\nappropriate circumstances, to warrant\ntolling the 10(b) period and/or inferring\nunlawful motive in an unfair labor\npractice case are legitimate remedial\n\n169 See, e.g., comments of FMI, ALFA, AHCA.\n\nmeasures supported by extensive Board\nand court precedent.\n\nIn addition, in a number of places the\nNPRM used the term “sanctions” in a\nvery loose sense to refer to aspects of the\nproposed enforcement scheme,\ninadvertently suggesting that this\nscheme was punitive. The term\n“sanctions” was an inapt choice of\ndescriptor for the enforcement scheme:\nthe classic 8(a)(1) remedial order has\nlong been upheld as nonpunitive;\nequitable tolling is concerned with\nfairness to employees, not punishment\nof misconduct, and is fully consistent\nwith current Board doctrine; and the\nanimus provision is little more than the\ncommon-sense extension of well-\nestablished evidentiary principles that\napply to many other NLRA violations,\nand is also not designed to punish\nemployers. That they may also furnish\nincentives for employers to comply with\nthe notice-posting rule does not detract\nfrom their legitimacy; if it were\notherwise, the Board could never\nimpose any remedy for violations of the\nNLRA if the remedy had a deterrent\neffect. In any event, the Board hereby\ndisavows any suggestion from\nstatements in the NPRM that the\nremedial measures were proposed solely\nas penalties.\n\nContrary to the tenor of numerous\ncomments opposing this rule,17° the\nBoard is not issuing the rule in order to\nentrap unwary employers and make\noperations more difficult for them\nbecause of inadvertent or technical\nviolations. It is doing so in order that\nemployees may come to understand\ntheir NLRA rights through exposure to\nnotices posted in their workplaces\nexplaining those rights. Accordingly,\nthe important thing is that the notices be\nposted. As explained above, an\nemployer that fails to post the notice\nbecause it is unaware of the rule, but\npromptly posts the notice when the rule\nis brought to its attention, will nearly\nalways avoid any further proceedings.\nSimilarly, an employer that posts the\nnotice but fails initially to comply with\none of the technical posting\nrequirements will almost always avoid\nfurther problems by correcting the error\nwhen it is called to the employer's\nattention. And if an employer is unsure\nof what the rule requires in a particular\nsetting, it can seek and receive guidance\nfrom the Board.\n\nThe Service Employees International\nUnion and the United Food and\nCommercial Workers propose that, in\n\n170 For example, “This seems to be yet another\ntrap for the employers. Another avenue to subject\nthem to law suits and interrogations, and\nuneconomic activities and ungodly expenditures.”\n\naddition to the proposed enforcement\nscheme, the rule state that an\nemployer’s knowing failure to post the\nnotice of employee rights during the\ncritical period before a representation\nelection shall be grounds for setting the\nelection aside on the filing of proper\nobjections. The Board finds that this is\nunnecessary, because the Board’s notice\nof election, which must be posted by an\nemployer three working days before an\nelection takes place, contains a\nsummary of employee NLRA rights and\na list of several kinds of unfair labor\npractices, and failure to post that notice\nalready constitutes grounds for setting\nan election aside.171 In any event,\nduring a union organizing campaign, the\nunion can instruct members of its in-\nplant organizing committee to verify\nwhether the notice required under this\ntule has been posted; if it has not, the\nunion can so inform the employer and,\nif need be, the Board’s regional office.\n\nSubpart C—Ancillary Matters\n\nSeveral technical issues unrelated to\nthose discussed in the two previous\nsubparts are set out in this subpart.\n\nIV. Dissenting View of Member Brian E.\nHayes\n\n“Agencies may play the sorcerer’s\napprentice but not the sorcerer\nhimself.” 172\n\nToday, my colleagues conjure up a\nnew unfair labor practice based on a\nnew statutory obligation. They impose\non as many as six million private\nemployers the obligation to post a notice\nof employee rights and selected\nillustrative unfair labor practices. The\nobligation to post is deemed enforceable\nthrough Section 8(a)(1)’s proscription of\ninterference with employees’ Section 7\nrights, and the failure to post is further\npenalized by equitable tolling of Section\n10(b)’s limitations period and the\npossible inference of discriminatory\nmotivation for adverse employment\nactions taken in the absence of posting.\nWhile the need for a more informed\nconstituency might be a desirable goal,\nit is attainable only with Congressional\nimprimatur. The Board’s rulemaking\nauthority, broad as it is, does not\nencompass the authority to promulgate\na rule of this kind. Even if it did, the\naction taken here is arbitrary and\ncapricious, and therefore invalid,\nbecause it is not based on substantial\nevidence and it lacks a reasoned\nanalysis.\n\n171 See Section 103.20 of the Board’s Rules and\nRegulations.\n\n172 Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 291\n(2001).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022308",
