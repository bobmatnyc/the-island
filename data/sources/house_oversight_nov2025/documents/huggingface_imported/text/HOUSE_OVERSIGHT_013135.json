Experiential education is by its nature an uncertain\nthing. One can strive to minimize the uncertainty, but it will still exist. Inspection of the\ninternals of an AGI’s mind is not a total solution to uncertainty minimization, because any\nAGI capable of powerful general intelligence is going to have a complex internal state that\nno external observer will be able to fully grasp, no matter how transparent the knowledge\nrepresentation.\n\nHowever, if what one is after is a plausible, pragmatic path to architecting and educating\nethical AGI systems, we believe the ideas presented here constitute a sensible starting-point.\nCertainly there is a great deal more to be learned and understood — the science and practice\nof AGI ethics, like AGI itself, are at a formative stage at present. What is key, in our view, is\nthat as AGI technology develops, AGI ethics develops alongside and within it, in a thoroughly\ncoupled way.\n\n12.5 Clarifying the Ethics of Justice: Extending the Golden Rule in\nto a Multifactorial Ethical Model\n\nOne of the issues with the “ethics of justice\" as reviewed above, which makes it inadequate\nto serve as the sole basis of an AGI ethical system (though it may certainly play a significant\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013135",
