  "text": "14.4 Implications of Patternist Philosophy for Derived Hypergraphs of Intelligent Systems 277\n\nCogPrime’s cognitive algorithms based on the explicitly existent Nodes and Links related to\nthe Frag Node.\n\nThis halo of Atoms related to the Frag node is called the Irag map. In general, some maps\nwill center around a particular Atom, like this rag map, others may not have any particular\nidentifiable center. CogPrime’s cognitive processes act directly on the level of Nodes and Links,\nbut they must be analyzed in terms of their impact on maps as well. In SMEPH terms, Cog-\nPrime maps may be said to correspond to SMEPH ConceptNodes, and for instance bundles of\nLinks between the Nodes belonging to a map may correspond to a SMEPH Link between two\nConceptNodes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013193",
