  "text": "Edwards adv. Epstein\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nSecond Renewed Motion for Leave to Assert Claim for Punitive Damages\n\nIt is thus neither necessary nor appropriate for a court to make evidentiary rulings,\nweigh rebuttal evidence, or engage in credibility determinations in considering the\nsufficiency of the proffer.\n\n“...a proffer should be evaluated by standards akin to those governing a motion to\ndismiss, where the truth of the plaintiff's allegations are assumed, and not the\nmore rigorous summary judgment standard, where the opposing party must show\nthat there is sufficient admissible evidence in the record to support a reasonable\njury finding in his favor.”\n\ni. INTRODUCTION\n\n~~» “The pleadings and discovery taken to date as confirmed by Epstein’s voluntary dismissal:\n\n~ of all-claims brought -by him against “Bradley-J.-Edwards, show: that thete-i¢’an absence of |\n\ncompetent evidence to demonstrate that Edwards participated in any fraud against Epstein, show\nthe propriety of every aspect of Edwards’ involvement in the prosecution of legitimate claims\nagainst Epstein, and further support the conclusion that Epstein sued Edwards out of malice and\nfor the — of intending to intimidate Edwards and Edwards’ ‘clients into abandoning or\ncompromising their legitimate claims against Epstein. Epstein sexually abused three clients of\nEdwards —L.M., EW. and I ane Doe — and Edwards properly and successfully represented them\nin a civil action against Epstein. Nothing in Edwards’s capable and competent representation of\nhis clients could serve as the basis for a civil lawsuit against him. Allegations about Edwards’s\nparticipation in or knowledge of the use of the civil actions against Epstein in a “Ponzi Scheme”\nwere never supporied by probable cause or any competent evidence and could never be\n\nsupported by competent evidence as they are entirely false.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013397",
