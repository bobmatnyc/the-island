  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nI bring to this task a strong and dynamic world view that has been shaped by my life experiences\nand which has, in turn, shaped my life experiences. In looking back on my life, I am inevitably\npeering through the prism of the powerful ideology that has provided a compass for my actions.\n\nIdeology is biography. Where we stand is the result of where we sat, who we sat next to, what\nwe observed, what happened to us, and how we reacted to our experiences.\n\nIdeology is complex. Its causes are multifaceted and rarely subject to quantification. The\nphilosopher, Descartes, who famously said, “I think therefore I am” got it backwards. I am—I\nwas, I will be—therefore I think what I think. The ability to think is inborn—a biological and\ngenetic endowment. The content of one’s thinking—the nature and quality of our ideas—is more\nnurture than nature. Without human experiences there could be no well-formed ideology, merely\nsimple inborn reflexes based on instinct and genetics.* There is no gene, or combination of genes,\nthat ordains the content of our views regarding politics, law, morality or religion.* Biology gives\nus the mechanisms with which to organize our experiences into coherent theories of life, but\nwithout these experiences—which begin in the womb and may actually alter the physical\nstructures of our brain over time—all we would have are the mechanics of thought and the\npotential for formulating complex ideas and ideologies. It is our interactions—with other human\nbeings, with nature, with nurture, with luck, with love, with hate, with pleasure, with pain, with\nour own limitations, with our mortality-—that shape our world views.\n\nAmong the most enduring and influential human encounters are those experienced at an early age.\nThese include the accidents of birth: to which family, in which place, at which time we happen to\ncome into the world. It is true that most people die with the religion and political affiliation into\nwhich they were born (or adopted). Identical twins, separated at birth, may share a common\ndisposition, IQ and susceptibility to disease, but they are likely to share the religious and political\naffiliations of their adoptive parents. There is little genetic about the factors that directly influence\nreligious, political or other ideological choices. They are largely a function of exposure to\nexternal factors.°\n\nMany of these external factors are totally beyond the control of the person. They may involve\ndecisions made by others, often before they were even born. Probably the most significant\ndecisions affecting my own life were made by my great grandparents on my father’s side and my\ngrandparents on my mother’s side: the decision to leave the shtetls of Poland and move to New\nYork. Had they remained in Poland, as some of my relatives did, I would probably not have\nsurvived the Holocaust, since I was three years old when the systematic genocide began.’ That\n\n3 Quote Steve Pinker\n\n“EN on Mark Hauser “Moral Minds.” Drew Weston, George Lakoff.\n\n> Kafka once quipped that “the meaning of life is that we die,” and when God told Adam and Eve that if they eat\nfrom the tree of knowledge, they will die, he meant they will obtain the knowledge of mortality—which elevated\nhumans above other species.\n\n° This is not to deny the likely influence genetics and biology may have on a predisposition toward homosexuality\nor other orientations. Nor is it to deny that biological predisposition may influence ideology through the prism of\nexperience. See [cite] [expand]\n\n’ Perhaps, of course, had my forbearers remained in Poland, my father might not have met my mother (although\ntheir families lived in neighboring shtetls). Accident, timing and luck determine virtually everything relating to\nbirth.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017094",
