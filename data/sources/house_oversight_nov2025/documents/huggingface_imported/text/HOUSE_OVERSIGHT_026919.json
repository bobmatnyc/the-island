Anyone looking to buy or sell single name\nequities should consult Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.\n\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n\nNevertheless, we believe that some of the headwinds that have plagued this sector will continue.\nThese include:\n\ne Data privacy issues impacting a broad range of companies, including Facebook, Google,\nTwitter, Alipay and Tencent.\n\ne High likelihood of greater regulatory scrutiny in the US? and Europe as policy makers\nincreasingly believe that these companies will not address “the privacy and security issues of\nsocial media users” on their own.\n\ne Increased focus by ESG investors (Environment, Social, and Governance) that many of the\ntechnology and social media companies are falling short on social and governance issues.\n\nWhile this basket of stocks may or may not lead the market in the future, it is important to note that\nthey represent only 10% of S&P 500 earnings.\n\nInvestment Implications\n\nThe recent market downdraft has understandably rekindled fears that the longest bull market in\nhistory is coming to an end. While there are no certainties in investing, we do not think the odds\nsupport that conclusion based on our read of the steady and unsteady factors discussed above. Keep\nin mind that about 75% of historical US bear markets—defined here as equity market declines of 20%\nor more—have occurred during economic recessions. In fact, US equity returns have remained\nfavorable until about five to six months prior to the onset of recession, highlighting the penalty for\nprematurely exiting the market (see Exhibit 11). With only 10% odds of recession over the next year,\nwe think the economic backdrop remains favorable for stocks.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026919",
