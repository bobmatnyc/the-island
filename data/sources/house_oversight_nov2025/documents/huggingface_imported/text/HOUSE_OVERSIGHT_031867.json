The interests of its\ninhabitants lie more with trading partners in the Mediterranean and\nthe rest of the world than with their countrymen. Their standard of\nliving is higher, and their commitment to traditions is lower.\nTherefore, there is an inherent tension between their immediate\ninterests and those of the Galileans, who live more precarious,\nwarlike lives. Countries can be divided over lesser issues — and\nwhen Israel is divided, it is vulnerable even to regional threats.\n\nWe say \"even\" because geography dictates that regional threats are\nless menacing than might be expected. The fact that Israel would be\noutnumbered demographically should all its neighbors turn on it is\nless important than the fact that it has adequate buffers in most\ndirections, that the ability of neighbors to coordinate an attack 1s\nminimal and that their appetite for such an attack is even less. The\nsingle threat that Israel faces from the northeast can readily be\nmanaged if the Israelis create a united front there. When Israel was\noverrun by a Damascus-based power, it was deeply divided\ninternally.\n\nIt is important to add one consideration to our discussion of buffers,\nwhich is diplomacy. The main neighbors of Israel are Egyptians,\nSyrians and those who live on the east bank of Jordan. This last\ngroup is a negligible force demographically, and the interests of the\nSyrians and Egyptians are widely divergent. Egypt's interests are to\nthe south and west of its territory; the Sinai holds no attraction. Syria\nis always threatened from multiple directions, and alliance with Egypt\nadds little to its security. Therefore, under the worst of circumstances,\nEgypt and Syria have difficulty supporting each other. Under the best\nof circumstances, from Israel's point of view, it can reach a political\naccommodation with Egypt, securing its southwestern frontier\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031867",
