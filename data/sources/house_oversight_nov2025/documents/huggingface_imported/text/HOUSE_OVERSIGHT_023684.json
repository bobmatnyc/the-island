  "text": "CHINA DAILY Wednesday, December 27, 2017\n\nVIEWS 9\n\n2017 YEAR-END: Politics\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\n\nWatchin\n\nhen future historians recon-\n\nstruct the long history of Chi-\n\nna, they will likely circle 2017\n\nas ayear of significance. I’ve\nseen it all this year, and attended or even\nparticipated in the major events. I’ve con-\nversed with Chinese leaders and experts,\nand searched for meaning.\n\nI didn’t appreciate the opportunity I've\nhad until I began reviewing the year from\nChina’s domestic perspective, seeking\nthemes and trends, discerning from what\nwe know about the recent past to what we\nmight forecast about the near-term future.\nIt takes no flash of insight to see the leader-\nship and vision of President Xi Jinping\nheadlining almost every event.\n\nFollowing is the review of the meaningful\nevents of 2017.\n\na January: Xi began\nthe year with a memo-\nrable speech at the\nWorld Economic Forum\nin Davos, Switzerland,\nmounting a roaring\ndefense of globaliza-\ntion, free trade, and\neconomic openness and.\nliberalization. It was the\nfirst-ever speech by Chi-\nna’s head of state at\nDavos and, as commentators the world over\nnoted with amazement and irony, as the\nUnited States under President Donald\nTrump was apparently retreating from the\nworld and abrogating global leadership,\nChina under President Xi was apparently\ndefending the international order and pro-\nmoting global governance.\n\nMarch: The annual “two sessions” of the\nNational People’s Congress, China’s top leg-\nislature, and the Chinese People’s Political\nConsultative Conference National Commit-\ntee, the top political advisory body, seemed\nto radiate more energy than usual, perhaps\nin anticipation of the 19th National Con-\ngress of the Communist Party of China in\nthe fall. A highlight was the adoption of the\ndraft general provisions of civil law, a step\ncloser to a long-needed unified civil code.\n\nIsensed delegates’ growing confidence\nand assertiveness to represent their particu-\nJar sectors in the competitive marketplace\nof public ideas and government funding, a\ncompetition that is vital for the develop-\nment of China’s kind of consultative democ-\nracy. This was especially true of the CPPCC\nNational Committee, whose members are\noften leading experts in their fields, such\nthat even though they do not have legal\nauthority to pass laws, they have moral\nauthority to exert pressure and affect\nchange. It did not escape notice that,\nthroughout the “two sessions”, Xi was recog-\nnized repeatedly as “core” of the CPC Cen-\ntral Committee and of the whole Party.\n\nRobert Lawrence\nKuhn\n\nBelt and Road to the fore\n\nMay: The first “Belt and Road Summit”\n(the Belt and Road Forum for International\nCooperation), held in Beijing, was the diplo-\nmatic highlight of the year in China. Some\n130 countries participated, including 29\nheads of state and government. The goal\nwas no less than the transformation of the\neconomic structure of the developing\nworld: building infrastructure and connec-\ntivity, stimulating development, alleviating\npoverty, reducing severe imbalances, pro-\nmoting South-South cooperation, and revi-\ntalizing globalization.\n\nXi called the Belt and Road Initiative “the\nproject of the century”.\n\nJuly: China celebrated the 20th anniver-\nsary of Hong Kong's return to the mother-\nland. It was a time of reflection for the\ncosmopolitan city, long a global leader in\neconomic freedom and competitiveness.\nHong Kong had flourished: its way of life\npreserved, its economy dynamic. But times\nchange. With Shanghai and Shenzhen on\nthe rise, and with some claiming the “one\ncountry, two systems” principle is in\ndecline, Hong Kong faces new challenges.\n\nAugust: The People’s Liberation Army\ncelebrated its 90th anniversary. In a move\nboth practical and symbolic, the PLA estab-\nlished its first overseas logistics base in Dji-\nbouti, situated strategically on the Horn of\nAfrica.\n\nXi Jinping, who is also chairman of the\nCentral Military Commission, said the PLA\nis becoming “strong” informationized\narmed forces. “The Chinese people love\npeace,” Xi said. “We will never seek aggres-\nsion or expansion, but ... No one should\nexpect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is\nharmful to our sovereignty, security or\ndevelopment interests”,\n\nForeigners are wondering: what is the\nPLAs long-term plan for operating over-\nseas? What will be the impact of the PLAS\nmodernization and reform, especially its\nburgeoning blue-water navy with multiple\naircraft carriers?\n\nAugust: China hosted the BRICS Sum-\nmit in Xiamen, East China’s Fujian prov-\nince. The five BRICS countries — Brazil,\nRussia, India, China and South Africa —\nhave increasing influence on global econo-\nmy and politics, but does BRICS as an orga-\nnization make sense? China certainly thinks\nso, and promoted the BRICS Summit as\n\nrepresenting a new kind of multilateral\nglobal governance. There are complexities:\npolitical instabilities in Brazil and South\nAfrica; the growing, comprehensive cooper-\nation between Russia and China; the sen-\nsitive, multifaceted relationship\nbetween India and China.\nThroughout the year, events on the\nKorean Peninsula continued to\nintrude. While China continued to\ncall for denuclearization and dia-\nlogue, just hours before Xi gave\nthe opening speech at the BRICS\nSummit, the Democratic People’s\nRepublic of Korea detonated its\nmost powerful nuclear bomb\never.\n\n19th Party Congress\nand the New Era\n\nOctober: The highlight of the\nyear was, as expected, the 19th\nCPC National Congress. Not quite\nexpected were the far-reaching\nproclamations and, taken together,\nthe magnitude of their significance. I\nwitnessed history and see six high-\nlights.\n\nFirst, Xi’s name and thought were writ-\nten into the CPC Constitution — “Xi Jinping\nThought on Socialism with Chinese Charac-\nteristics for a New Era” Xi is now, officially,\nthe overarching creator and arbiter of polit-\nical thought, and combined with his desig-\nnation as “core” of the CPC, he is now the\nundisputed, unimpeded leader with singu-\nJar authority. Xi Jinping “thought” is built\non the twin pillars of people orientation and\nnational rejuvenation, with the new con-\ncept of development (innovation, coordina-\ntion, green, open, sharing) driving anew\nkind of economic growth.\n\nSecond, the “New Era’, which is intended\nas a policy-energizing game changer, is a\nconceptual lens with which to view the\nrange of goals, strategies and concepts that\ncompose Xi’s way of thinking and the Par-\nty’s new direction.\n\nThe “New Era” is envisioned in three tem-\nporal segments: (i) from now until the ful-\nfillment of China’s first centenary goal of a\n“moderately prosperous society” in 2020\n(2021 being the 100th anniversary of the\nCPC); (ii) from 2020 to 2035, when the CPC\nstates it will build on the foundation of the\nmoderately prosperous society so that, after\n“15 years of hard work’; the country will\n“basically” realize “socialist modernization”;\nand (iii) from 2035 to 2050, when the CPC\nstates it will “work hard for a further 15\nyears” and “develop China into a country\nthat is prosperous, strong, democratic, cul-\nturally advanced, harmonious, and beauti-\nful”. Realizing this vision at mid-century,\naround 2050, with China being respected as\na great, modern, socialist country, is the sec-\nond centenary goal (2049 being the 100th\nanniversary of the People’s Republic of Chi-\nna).\n\nThird, the new “principal contradiction”\nin China’s “New Era” is between “unbal-\nanced and inadequate development” and\n“the people's ever-growing needs for a bet-\nter life’, which includes increasingly broad\ndemands for “democracy, rule of law, fair-\nNess and justice, security, and a better envi-\nronment” From now on, this new-era\nprincipal contradiction, replacing quantita-\ntive GDP growth with qualitative improve-\nment of life, is what will guide China’s\ndomestic affairs and policies.\n\nFourth, the Party’s leadership role in gov-\nerning the country is expanding and the\nParty’s stringent approach to governing\nitself is intensifying. The Party will be more\ndeeply embedded within agencies of gov-\nernment and sectors of society (including\nprivate companies, foreign businesses and\neducational institutions), and by reforming\nand purifying itself, the Party’s governance\nwill be stricter and more comprehensive.\nThe anti-corruption campaign, not only\ncontinues, it has been enhanced.\n\nFifth, the “New Era” has China moving\ncloser to center stage of the world and mak-\ning greater contributions to humanity,\noffering “Chinese wisdom” and “Chinese\nsolutions” for world problems. China’s\ndiplomacy will be proactive, championing\nthe development of a community with a\nshared future for humanity and encourag-\ning the evolution of the global governance\nsystem.\n\nSixth, I watched the new senior leaders of\nChina, the seven members of the new\nStanding Committee of the Political Bureau\nof the CPC Central Committee, walk out on\nstage, ending months, really years, of specu-\nlation and rumor. Because everything in\nChina reports to a Political Bureau Standing\nCommittee member, and because of the\nParty’s principle of collective leadership,\ntheir personalities, composition and bal-\nance determine the vision, strategies and\npolicies that shape China.\n\nThe importance of the Political Bureau\nStanding Committee remains true today,\nbut its importance frankly is also less true\ntoday. It is hard to overstate the conse-\nquences of Xi’s name written into the Party\nConstitution, thus inscribing into perpetu-\nity his predominant status and assuring\nhis continuing pre-eminence in the coun-\n\ntry’s political life.\n\nFollowing the 19th Party Congress, some\nmight have expected a respite, a slower\nNovember and December. They were any-\nthing but.\n\nForm is substance\n\nNovember: The “state visit-plus” of US\nPresident Donald Trump came at a delicate\nmoment. Amid pomp and pageantry,\nincluding a personal tour of the Palace\nMuseum (Forbidden City), $253 billion in\nbusiness deals were signed, a world record,\nthough critics complained it was all trans-\nactional, nothing structural. The number,\nsome said, was more form than substance,\nbut here, perhaps, form was substance.\nBoth Xi and Trump hailed the visit as “suc-\ncessful and historic”.\n\n‘Yet, on sensitive topics, one could be for-\ngiven for seeing sunlight between their\npositions. On trade, Xi lauded the business\ndeals and market access, “which will deliver\ngreat benefits for the two peoples” Trump\nsought improved trade with China based on\n“a level playing field for our workers” and\nsolving the “massive trade distortion” —\nwhich, characteristically, Trump blamed on\npast US administrations, not on China.\n\nOn the Democratic People’s Republic of\nKorea, Xi reiterated China’s firm commit-\nment for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula\nand direct communications, while Trump\nsaid that they “agreed not to replicate failed\napproaches of the past” and he called for\n“increased economic pressure until North\nKorea abandons its reckless and dangerous\npath”,\n\nSubsequent to Trump’s visit, China\nannounced revised regulations that were\nindeed structural. China will reduce or\neliminate (over time) limits on foreign\nownership of financial services sectors,\nincluding insurance, commercial banking,\nsecurities, futures, and asset manage-\nment.\n\nSignificantly, the State Council, China’s\nCabinet, established a Financial Stability\nand Development Committee to oversee\nfinancial stability and boost risk prevention\n(including close monitoring of “shadow\nbanking” and corporate debt). This new\nsupra-ministry commission will be empow-\nered to make decisions related to reform\nand development, coordinate issues con-\ncerning monetary policy, and establish\nfinancial policies and related fiscal and\nindustrial policies, thus improving the\nfinancial regulatory system.\n\nAt the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\nLeaders’ Meeting in Vietnam, Xi strength-\nened his themes of making economic glo-\nbalization more open, balanced and\ninclusive; lauded regional multilateralism\nfor promoting common interests; and\nstressed the Belt and Road Initiative for\nadvancing global connectivity.\n\nWhat struck me in Xi’s speech was what\nhe inserted about poverty: “To lift all the\n\nSHI YU / CHINA DAILY\n\nremaining poor people out of poverty is a\nsolemn commitment made by the Chinese\ngovernment to the people. It is uppermost\nin my mind, and I have spent more energy\non poverty alleviation than on anything\nelse.”\n\n“Upper most in my mind?” “More energy\non poverty alleviation than on anything\nelse?” An extraordinary statement from the\npresident! Although Xi has been making\nhigh-profile visits to numerous poor coun-\nties and villages, relentlessly championing\n“targeted poverty alleviation” for realizing\nthe “moderately prosperous society’; this\nwas his clearest statement that poverty alle-\nviation is his highest priority.\n\nMain contradiction reinforced\n\n‘Two unpleasant events in Beijing rein-\nforced the new “principal contradiction’,\nhighlighting “the people's ever-growing\nneeds for a better life” as that surprisingly\npowerful lens for viewing Chinese society.\nThe first was alleged child abuse at a kin-\ndergarten. The second was a fire in which\n19 migrant workers died. In both cases, net-\nizens reacted with anger: in the alleged.\nchild abuse, anger about a perceived cover-\nup; in the fire, anger for the disorderly and\ninconsiderate way of evacuating migrant\nworkers.\n\nWhen Xi first announced the new princi-\npal contradiction at the 19th Party Con-\ngress, some dismissed it as arcane Party-\nspeak. Public reaction to the alleged child\nabuse and to the fire revealed its prescient\nand perspicacious wisdom.\n\nThe second volume of Xi Jinping: The\nGovernance of China, a collection of 99 of\nXi’s speeches, conversations, instructions\nand letters, was published. The book offers\naresource to follow the development of Xi’s\nways of thinking and ideas and to under-\nstand China’s new guiding philosophy and\nthe specific elements that compose it.\n\nThe month ended with what may seem a\nlight touch when Xi called for China to\nupgrade its toilets. Toilets among the year’s\nhighlights? Xi was serious and his point is\nprobative. For China to become a more civi-\nlized society, the hygiene of the people must\nbe improved (especially in rural areas), and\nfor China’s tourism industry to blossom,\nbetter bathrooms are needed. Although\nChina’s leader talking toilets elicits smiles,\nand some say it downgrades his dignity, it\ndemonstrates, above all, Xi’s intrinsic com-\nmitment to improve the quality of life for\nthe Chinese people.\n\nDecember: In the first nine days of the\nmonth, Xi engaged with four international\nevents, stressing common commitment to\nbuild a community of a shared future for all\nhumanity.\n\nThe four engagements\n\nTo the “CPC in Dialogue with World Polit-\nical Parties High-Level Meeting” Xi\n\nChina’s year for history\n\ndescribed four views of the future: a world\nthat is safe and free of fear; prosperous and\nfree of poverty; open, inclusive and free of\nisolation; and environmentally clean and\nbeautiful.\n\nAt the “Fourth World Internet Confer-\nence’; Xi asserted how the internet posed\nnew challenges for sovereignty, security and\ndevelopment.\n\nAt the “2017 Fortune Global Forum’, Xi\ncalled for openness and innovation to\nenhance global economic growth, pledging\nto liberalize and facilitate trade and foreign\ninvestment in China.\n\nAnd at the “South-South Human Rights\nForum”, Xi emphasized that “human rights\nmust and can only be promoted in light of\nspecific national conditions and people’s\nneeds”.\n\nThe CPC's Dialogue with World Political\nParties was path-setting in that it put the\nworld on notice that a transformed CPC\nunder Xi is reaching out globally with pride\nand confidence — explaining, especially to\ndeveloping countries, the developmental\nbenefits of party leadership and party build-\ning. The point of debate, as it were, has\nshifted from whether the China model of a\nperpetually ruling party (with all that\nentails) is good for China to how the China\nmodel is good for other countries.\n\nAt a meeting of the Political Bureau of the\nCPC Central Committee, Xi directed author-\nities to improve digital infrastructure, pro-\nmote the integration and sharing of digital\nresources, and protect data security, in\norder to better serve the nation’s economic\nand social development as well as to\nimprove people's lives. The big vision is to\nturn China into a world leader in big data\nand a global innovation hub for artificial\nintelligence by 2030.\n\nThe last major event of the year was the\nannual Central Economic Work Conference,\nwhich identified “three tough battles” for\nthe next three years: preventing and defus-\ning risks (especially financial risks), elimi-\nnating absolute poverty (China’s 2020 goal),\nand curbing pollution (for instance, encour-\naging investment in environmental pro-\njects). Setting three-year targets was itself\nan innovation (over the traditional one-year\ntargets), thereby strengthening long-term\nthinking, reducing pressures to make hasty\ndecisions, and giving markets stable expec-\ntations.\n\nThe priority of reducing absolute debt\nwas modified to controlling a rise in bor-\nrowing, such that China’s debt-to-GDP ratio\ndoes not further deteriorate. This signaled\nthat growth would not be jeopardized and\n(to the disappointment of some) debt-driv-\nen growth would continue.\n\nTo contain financial risk, China will\ncrackdown on irregular and illegal activities\nin its chaotic financial industry and intensi-\nfy regulatory scrutiny; continue supply-side\nstructural reform (reducing overcapacities);\nand maintain a proactive fiscal policy, a\nprudent and neutral monetary policy, anda\nbasically stable yuan exchange rate.\n\nResisting arguments for shrinking State-\nowned enterprises, China will make SOEs\n“stronger, better and bigger”; and the gov-\nernment will seek efficiencies by becoming\nmore of an investor and less of an operator.\n\nChina pledged to open up its markets fur-\nther and to balance trade by boosting\nimports (US pressures, expressed vividly by\nTrump, were not mentioned).\n\nTheoretical foundation\n\nAfter five years of “practice”, the theoreti-\ncal foundation of China’s economic devel-\nopment is now labeled, “Xi Jinping\nThought on Socialist Economy with Chi-\nnese Characteristics for a New Era’, paral-\nleling the phrase added to the Party\nConstitution two months earlier. The\n“thought” is based mainly on Xi’s new con-\ncept of development — innovative, coordi-\nnated, green, open and shared development\n— which has been the core of his economic\nphilosophy.\n\nFor the first time at this annual confer-\nence, topics other than economics were on.\nthe agenda. Diverse public concerns were\naddressed, such as burdensome homework\nfor schoolchildren, sex discrimination in\nthe workplace, and online scams. This was a\nclear consequence of how China’s new\n“principal contradiction” in the “New Era”\nnow drives domestic policy; as Chinese citi-\nzens seek a “better life’; the government\nmust respond.\n\nTo pick one message to characterize the\nyear, it is this. In 2017, under the leadership\nof Xi, China set the trajectory, in all vital\nareas, of the country’s domestic develop-\nment and international engagement for the\nnext 30-plus years, to mid-century, to 2050.\n\nEvery year brings challenges. For China,\nno doubt, big ones lie ahead. In 2018, China\nwill celebrate the 40th anniversary of\nreform and opening-up. The world is\nwatching.\n\nThe author is a public intellectual, interna-\ntional corporate strategist and investment\nbanker, and China expert/commentator.
