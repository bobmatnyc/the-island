  "text": "97\n\nPromoting Integrity\n\nFiguring out how to properly counter the PRC’s influence operations in both\nEnglish- and Chinese-language media presents enormous challenges in a free society.\nThe United States could consider restrictions on state-controlled media outlets,\nwhich would not include publicly funded broadcasters, such as the BBC, which\nmaintain editorial independence. Failing that, the recent requirement that state-run\npublications, TV and radio broadcasters, and potentially their employees, register as\nagents of a foreign government is a partial solution.*’ And in late 2017, Russia’s RT\nregistered as a foreign agent®® while in September 2018, the US Justice Department\n\nreportedly also ordered CGTN and Xinhua to register as agents of a foreign power.*!\n\nWhen it comes to independent Chinese-language media, the US government should\nconsider doing more to help such independent outlets survive, including using\ngrants via the Fulbright program or other vehicles, such as the State Department\nInternational Visitors or Speakers’ Bureau. Domestically, the US government could also\nconsider aiding the operations of independent Chinese-language media, including\nmanufacturing credits for printing press operations, and nonprofit tax designations\n\nto allow journalism business models to survive the current transitional crisis. Private\ncharitable foundations can also make a difference in helping independent Chinese-\n\nlanguage media remain editorially independent and financially viable.\n\nPromoting Reciprocity\n\nThe time has come for the US government to demand reciprocity for American\njournalists attempting to do their professional work in China. To the extent that they\nare prevented from doing so as a result of visa denials and restrictions of access, the US\nState Department should respond in kind by restricting visas and access for Chinese\njournalists in the United States. To the extent that American journalists experience\nharassment and physical violence, this should also have a bearing on the granting of\n\nvisas and access to Chinese journalists.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 He Qinglian has written the most detailed study of the Chinese-language media landscape in the United\nStates. It is currently unpublished.\n\n2 Troianovski, Anton. “China Agency Nears Times Square.” Wall Street Journal.
