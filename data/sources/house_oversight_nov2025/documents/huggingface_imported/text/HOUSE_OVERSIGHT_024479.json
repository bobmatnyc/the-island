Although the Company intends to use leverage in a manner it\nbelieves to be prudent, the leveraged capital structure the Company plans to utilize may significantly\nincrease the Company's exposure to adverse economic factors such as rising interest rates, downturns in\nthe economy or deteriorations in the condition of the businesses or their respective industries. If a\nbusiness cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet debt obligations, the Company may suffer a partial\nor total loss of capital invested in such business.\n\nThe Company's ability to service its substantial indebtedness, and meet its other obligations depends on\nits future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of\nwhich are outside the Company's conirol. The Company cannot be certain that its cash flow will be\nsufficient for such purposes. If the Company does not have enough liquidity, it may be required to\nrefinance all or part of its existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money. The Company cannot\nguarantee that it will be able tc do so on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of existing or\nfuture debt agreements, may restrict the Company from pursuing any of these alternatives.\n\nThe substantial level of indebtedness incurred by the Company may have the following consequences of\npotential concern to investors in the Company:\n\ne The Company must use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay interest and\nprincipal on its indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other business purposes such\nas capital expenditures;\n\ne The Company's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\n« The Company may be limited in its ability to borrow additional funds;\n« The Company may have a higher level of indebtedness than some of its competitors, which may\nput it at a competitive disadvantage and reduce its flexibility in planning for, or responding to,\n\nchanging conditions in its industry, including increased competition; and\n\ne The Company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments than it\nwould without the leverage.\n\nAdverse developments in the Company's financial condition would have adverse effects upon the\nbusiness and results of the Company as a whole.\n\n6.1.5 The Company faces intense competition in the early childhood care and\neducation services industry from numerous other types of providers\n\nThe early childhood care and education services industry is competitive and highly fragmented. The most\nimportant competitive factors generally are quality, convenience and, to a lesser extent, price. The\nCompany's, specifically KLC OpCo's, competition in this industry consists principally of:\n\ne other for-profit, center-based child care providers, including franchise organizations;\n\ne preschool, kindergarten and before and after school programs provided by public schools;\n\n46\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024479",
