  "text": "I'm so grateful for my relatively liberal, relatively sex-positive upbringing. I think it did\nme a world of good. But here are my five biggest problems with the way I learned\nabout sexuality:\n\n1. L wish that I hadn't gotten this message: \"Sex is easy, light-hearted -- and if it's not,\nyou're doing it wrong.\"\n\nDo I believe sex can be easy? Sure. Do I think it can be light-hearted? Absolutely! But do\nI think it's always those things? No, and I don't think it \"ought to” be.\n\nI think we need to teach that sex can be incredibly difficult. It can be hard to\ncommunicate with your partner. It can be hard to learn and come to terms with your own\nsexual desires. It can be hard to understand or accept all your partner's sexual desires.\nAnd just because it's hard, doesn't mean that you're with the wrong partner -- or that\nyou're missing some vital piece of information that everyone else has -- or that you're\ndoing it wrong.\n\nAnd as for light-hearted, well -- sure, sex can be \"happy rainbows joy joy!\", but it can\nalso be serious... or dark. And there's nothing wrong with that!\n\nI recently talked to a friend, who also identifies as a BDSMer, about our stories of\ncoming into BDSM. Both of us had sadomasochistic fantasies from a very early age\n(mine, for instance, started in grade school -- seriously, I actually did tie up my Barbie\ndolls). I told my friend about how I'd always had these intense, dark, violent feelings --\nbut when I made it to middle school, I remember a change. I had a series of vivid BDSM-\nish dreams, and I freaked out. I closed it all away, I stopped thinking about it, I repressed\nit all as savagely as I could.\n\nBefore that, I had also started thinking about sex. I imagined sex at great length; I read\nabout sex. I had long since filched my parents’ copy of The Joy of Sex and examined it,\ncover to cover -- not to mention many other fine sexuality works, like Nancy Friday's\ncompilation of female sexual fantasies My Secret Garden. I was totally fascinated by sex.\nI talked about it so much that one of my friends specifically searched out a vibrator as a\nbirthday present for me. I actually pressured my first major boyfriend into some sexual\nacts before he was ready, which I suppose is an interesting reversal of stereotype (but to\nbe clear, it's not okay that I did that). As I started having sex, I found that I liked it okay,\nbut knew a lot was missing -- and couldn't figure out what.\n\nIt took me years and years to connect sex to BDSM -- to figure out that the biggest thing I\nwas missing was BDSM. Why? Because BDSM was horrible and wrong, and I'd shut it\naway; BDSM (I thought) couldn't possibly have anything to do with the bright, shiny,\nhappy horizon of sex! Coming into BDSM was a crisis for me partly because -- although\nI knew other people practiced it, and had never thought much about that -- my own need\nfor those dark feelings totally shocked me. This wasn't me. This wasn't healthy sex. Sex\nwas light-hearted, happy rainbows joy joy!... wasn't it?\n\nIn contrast, my friend -- who had an extremely sexually repressed upbringing -- never\nhad any trouble integrating BDSM into his sex life. Sex, for him, was already wrong and\nbad... so as he got in touch with his sexuality and began having sex, BDSM was involved\nfrom the start. After all, there was no reason for it not to be.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018461",
