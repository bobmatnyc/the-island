  "text": "ignorance, the emptiness and its mystery. Computations of the entropy of systems\nin motion convert questions and answers concerning the detailed workings of the\nleg’s neuromuscular machinery to global statistical descriptions of more abstract\nthematic motifs, forms, expressed in the dance. Patterns of behavior of these\nproperties can suggest intuitive ideas and imagery about global mechanisms,\napproach/avoid, smooth/discrete, wildtame, as well as correlated and objective\nphysical observables.\n\nTo learn more about this abstract, topology tinged (none numeric) style of\nmodel building, we can go to school on a long studied physical example. It connects\na simple and well understood rea/ world observable with abstract statistical patterns\nresulting from motions using the one-to-one correspondence (the equivalence\nrelation called isomorphism) between their entropies. As we have discussed, the\nStanford mathematician and Field’s Medal Winner, Donald Ornstein, proved that in\nstatistical studies of even point-to-point unpredictable, chaotic systems, entropy is\nthe only isomorphism. The hardware of this physical example is what the statistical\nphysicists call a dilute gas of some fixed number, n, of uniform hard spheres,\nmoving scatterers, that, absent of dissipative friction, wander continuously around,\nchanging their directions when bumping into each other. In a two dimensional\nbounded arena of randomly rolling balls, this game has been called Sinai’s billiards.\nIt was named for previously mentioned Ya Sinai, an eminent Russian\nmathematician He is now at Princeton and was previously a student of Andrei\nNikolaevic Kolmogorov, the Russian guru of many of the Twentieth Century’s world-\nclass Russian mathematicians. Kolmogorov axiomatized the field of probability and,\nmore relevantly, initiated the theory of statistical descriptions, the ergodic theory, of\nnonlinear dynamical systems. |In the language of statistical physics, we will see that\nthe same system produced by high number of elements executing Newton’s\ndeterministic laws can be generated by a so-called random system such as that\nresulting from flipping a suitably biased coin. Our example can also serve as a\nmetaphor, used extensively in the mathematical biology of the late Professor Art\nWinfree, for the temporal features of life on a topological circle: the natural\n\nirregularities of the recurrent beat of the heart, the in and out breathing of lungs, the\n\n103\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013603",
