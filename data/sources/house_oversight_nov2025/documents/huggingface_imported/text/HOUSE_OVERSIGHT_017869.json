Sau-\ndi Arabia’s treatment of and decisions to\nsupport Islamic charities are purely plan-\nning level “decisions grounded in social,\neconomic, and political policy.” Varig Atr-\nlines, 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755; see\nalso Kline, 685 F.Supp. at 392. The Fed-\neral Plaintiffs have not met their burden of\ndemonstrating an exception to the FSIA\napplies to negate the Kingdom’s immunity.\n“[Slovereion immunity under the FSIA is\nimmunity from suit, not just from liabili-\nty.” Moran v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\n27 F.3d 169, 172 th Cir.1994). Because\nthere were no factual disputes raised in\nthe Court’s resolution of this motion, no\njurisdictional discovery is necessary. See\nFiletech S.A. v. France Telecom S.A., 304\nF.8d 180, 188 (2d Cir.2002). The Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia’s motion to dismiss the\nFederal complaint for lack of subject mat-\nter jurisdiction is granted.\n\nII. Personal Jurisdiction\n\n[33-36] To avoid dismissal for lack of\npersonal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2),\nPlaintiffs must establish personal jurisdic-\ntion over each Defendant. Bank Brussels\nLambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez,\n171 F.3d 779, 784 (2d Cir.1999). Because\nthese motions are brought before discov-\nery and decided without an evidentiary\nhearing, Plaintiffs need only make a prima\nfacie showing that personal jurisdiction ex-\nists. PDK Labs, Inc. v. Friedlander, 103\nF.8d 1105, 1108 @d Cir.1997); AZ. Trade\nFinance, Inc. v. Petra Bank, 989 F.2d 76,\n79 (2d Cir.1993). Plaintiffs may rely en-\ntirely on factual allegations, Jazini v. Nis-\nsan Motor Co. 148 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir.\n1998), and they will prevail even if Defen-\ndants make contrary arguments, A.J\nTrade, 989 F.2d at 79. In resolving the\nmotions, the Court will read the com-\nplaints and affidavits in a light most favor-\nable to Plaintiffs. PDK Labs, 103 F.3d at\n1108. It will not, however, accept legally\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nconclusory assertions or draw “argumenta-\ntive inferences.” Mende v. Milestone\nTech, Inc, 269 F.Supp.2d 246, 251\n(S.D.N.Y.2003) (citing Robinson v. Over-\nseas Military Sales Corp., 21 F.3d 502, 507\n(2d Cir.1994)).\n\nA. Bases for Personal Jurisdiction\n\n1. New York Long—Arm Statute\n\n[37] “In a federal question case where\na defendant resides outside the forum\nstate, a federal court applies the forum\nstate’s personal jurisdiction rules if the\nfederal statute does not specifically pro-\nvide for national service of process.” PDK\nLabs, 103 F.3d at 1108. Similarly, a feder-\nal court sitting in diversity exercises per-\nsonal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant\nto the same extent as courts of general\njurisdiction of the state in which it sits\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\ndure 4(kK))(A). Bank Brussels Lambert\nv. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez, 305 F.3d\n120, 124 (@d Cir.2002). In such cases,\ncourts must determine if New York law\nwould confer jurisdiction through its long-\narm statute, and then decide if the exer-\ncise of such jurisdiction comports with the\nrequisites of due process under the Four-\nteenth Amendment. /d. (citing Bank\nBrussels, 171 F.8d at 784); Bensusan\nRest. Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25, 27 (2d\nCir.1997).\n\na. Conspiracy Theory\n\nPlaintiffs claim that New York’s long-\narm statute provides a basis for personal\njurisdiction. Rule 302(a)(2) of New York’s\nCivil Practice Law & Rules states in part:\n“(a) As to a cause of action arising from\nany of the acts enumerated in this section,\na court may exercise personal jurisdiction\nover any non-domiciliary, or his executor\nor administrator, who in person or through\nan agent ...
