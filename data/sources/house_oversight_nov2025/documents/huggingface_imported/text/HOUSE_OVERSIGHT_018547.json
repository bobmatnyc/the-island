  "text": "Here's my short answer for those guys: If you know women who are submissive and/or\nmasochistic in bed, that means those particular women like being submissive and/or\nmasochistic in bed. It doesn't mean anything else.\n\nYou're still here? Ah, well. I figured that wouldn't satisfy. So here's a longer answer:\n\nFirstly, if you're a straight dude, and you're drawing conclusions about \"all women\" based\non the women you get involved with, then stop. Just stop. Even if you have slept with\nzillions of women, you don't actually know what all women want, because:\n\nA) Your experience of women is limited to women who got involved with you. You\nare screening for certain qualities, sometimes consciously, and sometimes unconsciously\nor by accident. If you tend to enjoy the dominant role, for example, or if you use a\ndominant style of flirtation, then you could be screening for submissive female partners,\nwhether you intend to or not.\n\nB) Everyone has biases, including you. I love the old saying: \"When all you have is a\nhammer, everything looks like a nail.\" If you have a bias towards seeing women as\nsexually submissive (and you almost certainly do, because female sexual submission is a\nhugely prevalent cultural trope), then you're more likely to see female submission in\nplaces where it does not exist.\n\nC) Women, like people of all genders, are demonstrably varied. You really don't think\nnon-submissive straight women exist? Why then, it must be so inconvenient when I point\nyou to the work of blatantly dominant women, huh? It's shocking, I know... next I'll be\ntelling you that queer and asexual women exist! (Not to mention women who switch\namong roles -- from submissive to dominant, from sadistic to masochistic. I primarily go\nfor submissive masochism, but still, I myself play for both teams.)\n\nThe thing is, though... no matter how many holes I can poke in these dudes' anecdotal\n\"data,\" I can't bring myself to worry like they do. Even if a brilliant, well-reviewed study\ncame out tomorrow and proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that 100% of women are\nsubmissive masochists in bed, I wouldn't care. (I bet you my left ear this study will never\nhappen, but I'm just saying, even if it did, I wouldn't care.)\n\nLet me say it really clearly: Even if most women are submissive masochists in bed\n(and I'm not convinced most women are), there's nothing wrong with that. I don't\ncare.\n\nWhy don't I care? Because all this anxiety and argument about submission -- and in\nparticular, what it means for women to be submissive; whether all women are\nsubmissive; whether women are \"inherently\" or \"biologically\" submissive; whether\nBDSM is an orientation or not... this is all the wrong question.\n\nI'll note that the research seems to indicate that more kinky women are submissive than\ndominant. Of course, this doesn't necessarily indicate anything about the tastes of women\nwho don't identify as kinky. And it's probably biased by culture, in that everything from\nfashion photos to romance novels emphasizes female submission and male dominance.\nWithin BDSM culture, female dominance and male submission are often disappeared,\nmuch to the justified frustration of actual female dominants and male submissives.
