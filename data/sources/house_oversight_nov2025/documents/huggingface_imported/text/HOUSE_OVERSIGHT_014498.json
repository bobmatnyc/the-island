However, the federal government\nusually offers a credit of 5.4\npercent, meaning most employers actually\npay about 0.6 percent, according\nto the IRS.\nStates — and territories — with\nunemployment insurance programs\nmeeting federal standards are required\nto meet their unemployment\nobligations. When a state can’t meet\nits unemployment obligations, it’s\nentitled to take loans from the Federal\nUnemployment Insurance Trust\nFund.\nFederal documents show only one\nstate and one jurisdiction — California\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands — are\ncurrently in that position.\nThe territory owes $69,138,266.61\nin loans, according to the U.S. Department\nof Treasury website.\nIn fiscal year 2017, which began\nOct. 1, the loans have accrued\n$294,349.15 in interest payments\nalone.\nThe V.I. Labor Department is in\ncharge of administering unemployment\ninsurance. Labor Commissioner\nCatherine Hendry did not return a\nnumber of phone calls seeking comment.\nGovernment House spokeswoman\nCherie Munchez would not comment,\nsaying that Hendry would issue\na prepared statement about the debt\nby Wednesday.\nProvisions of the Federal Unemployment\nTax Act stipulate that in\nstates or territories with outstanding\nbalances in the fund, businesses are\nsubject to a credit reduction, which is\ncollected and directed toward the unpaid\nbalance, according to Robert Pavosevich,\nSupervisor of the Actuarial\nTeam in the Office of Unemployment\nInsurance’s Division of Fiscal and\nActuarial Services in the Department\nof Labor.\nVirgin Islands business owners\nwill pay the original 0.6 percent, plus\nan additional 1.8 percent caused by\nthe unpaid balance, for a total of 2.4\npercent, Pavosevich said.\nAt the fully discounted rate, an\nemployer would pay $42 for each\nemployee earning $7,000. At the Virgin\nIslands rate, employers will have\nto pay $168.\nAfter two years with an unpaid\nbalance, the discount decreases by\n0.3 percent each year until the total\ndiscount disappears, Pavosevich said.\n“It’s capped at 6 percent,” Pavosevich\nsaid.\nAt the full 6 percent, employers\nwill have to pay $420 for each new\nemployee earning $7,000 that comes\non board. By law, that money can’t\ncome out of the wages themselves\nand is paid out of the profits or losses\nthat employers face, said Charles\nEngeman, an attorney who served on\nthe Unemployment Insurance Advisory\nCouncil under the administration\nof Gov. John deJongh Jr.\nWithout payment on the loan — or\nwaivers or relief, which has happened\nthree times since 2013 — the rate is\nscheduled to max out by 2028. That’s\nbarring the imposition of step increases,\nwhich can happen if the state\nhas an outstanding balance for a certain\nnumber of years, or if — as was\nthe case in the tax year 2012 — step\nincreases are piled on by other provisions\nof the law, which could move\nthe unemployment tax rate up faster.\n“It looks like they’re not making\nmuch headway,” Pavosevich said, referring\nto the territory’s debt.\nThe territory wasn’t alone in 2011,\nthe first year the rate went up. In all,\n20 states and the Virgin Islands received\na 0.3 percent credit reduction\nthat year, federal documents show.\nThat’s in part because of the lingering\neffects of the Great Recession,\nsaid Bennett Chan, a lawyer who\nrepresents several businesses and has\nworked with the St. Thomas-St. John\nChamber of Commerce in the past.\nIn general terms, states collected\nmore money than they paid out during\nthe years leading up to the 2008\nmarket collapse, creating large surpluses.\nSometimes those surpluses\nwere subject to financial raids. Other\ntimes — as was the case in the territory\n— the surpluses were used as\na cause to reduce the amounts collected\nfor unemployment insurance.\nWhen large-scale unemployment hit\nas a result of the recession, surpluses\nturned into deficits, Chan said.\n“A lot of states were blindsided\nby the Great Recession,” Chan said.\n“They also had big surpluses and\nnever foresaw that there would be\nthis sudden inflow in unemployment\nclaims.”\nTerritorial officials were late in reacting\nto bring the rate back up to address\nthe issue, Chan said.\n“If we had done it earlier, we probably\nwould have collected enough,”\nhe said. “Now they want to make it\nup when times are hard.”\nIn many cases, the government\ncan’t say what each employer owes\n“\nI don’t think there’s enough political willpower to do\nthe kinds of thing necessary to fix the system.\n— Charles Engeman,\nan attorney who served on the Unemployment Insurance Advisory\nCouncil under the administration of Gov. John deJongh Jr.\n“\nThe business owners always bear the brunt of\nwhatever deficiencies we have. We have to, at some\npoint, find other sources of revenue for the\ngovernment. Any time there’s any sort of additional\ntax burden, fee burden, licensing burden, it’s always\na point of concern.\n— Kimberly McCollum,\npresident of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce\nor has paid in surplus, Engeman said.\nThe system originally was set up so\nthat employers faced a roller coaster,\nEngeman said.\nEach employer had a rate based\non a three-year average. If an employer’s\naccount paid out more in\nbenefits than they contributed, the\nrate would go up to 5.4 percent. After\nthree years, the employer’s rate would\ndrop down to 0.1 percent, because at\n5.4 percent, the rate exceeded likely\ncontributions.\nAt 0.1 percent, if anyone were laid\noff, it immediately moved the employer\nback to the 5.4 percent rate.\nEmployers would oscillate between\nthe 5.4 percent rate and the 0.1 percent\nrate.\n“It was 5.4 for many employers,\nand that’s what an average employer\nwould pay out over the course of 17\nyears for one employee,” Engeman\nsaid.\nAs a result, the unemployment\ninsurance fund accumulated large\nsurpluses. To reduce the surpluses,\nthe V.I. Labor Department dropped\nthe automatic increase based on a\nnegative account, and lowered the\nminimum rate to 0. Less money came\nin, even as unemployment rates remained\nhigh and benefits remained\nexpensive.\nA few steps could help move\nthe system back to sound footing,\nEngeman said. For example, better\nrecord-keeping would help reduce\ndelinquencies. Reducing unemployment\ninsurance benefits and\nreducing the amount of time the\nunemployed are eligible for unemployment\nwould both help. Verifying\nthat those collecting unemployment\nare seeking employment, and\ngenerally reducing fraud also would\nhelp, Engeman said.\n“I don’t think there’s enough political\nwillpower to do the kinds of thing\nnecessary to fix the system,” he said.\nChamber of Commerce officials\non both islands decried any increase\nin taxes or fees for businesses.\n“Despite what the governor and\nthe senators think, the economy of\nthe Virgin Islands is not doing that\nwell,” said Tom Brunt III, a member\nof the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber\nof Commerce Board of Directors.\nKimberly McCollum, president of\nthe St. Croix Chamber of Commerce,\nsaid any increases to fees or taxes was\nworrying.\n“The business owners always bear\nthe brunt of whatever deficiencies we\nhave,” she said. “We have to, at some\npoint, find other sources of revenue\nfor the government. Any time there’s\nany sort of additional tax burden, fee\nburden, licensing burden, it’s always\na point of concern.”\nThe folly of the situation is compounded\nby the fact that business\nowners themselves aren’t allowed to\nfile for unemployment if they lose\ntheir jobs, McCollum said.\n“You’re still paying unemployment\ntaxes on what you’re paid, but you are\nnot allowed to request compensation\nshould you find yourself in a position\nto file for unemployment,” she said.\n— Contact Brian O’Connor at\n340-714-9130 or email boconnor@\ndailynews.vi.\nISSN 2159-3019\nDaily News Publishing Co.

I am\na fair person,” Caproni said. “I want\nto listen to what they have to say. It\nseems as though they’re going to put\ntogether an offer.”\nCaproni had told The Daily News\non Monday he was announcing a\nwork stoppage beginning Wednesday.\nHe said he and other haulers were going\nto stop emptying scores of bins\nacross St. Thomas and St. John because\nWaste Management had failed\nto pay them for weeks or months.\nCaproni said he has worked 26\nyears in trash removal and roll on/\nBy BRIAN O’CONNOR\nDaily News Staff\nPolice officials dismissed this week\nmultiple complaints filed by a former\nemployee against high-ranking members\nof the V.I. Police Department.\nThe complaints are all filed by\nLynne Harrison, the former director\nof the Police Training Bureau.\nIn one such complaint, Harrison\nalleges Deputy Commissioner Curtis\nGriffin Jr. was “receiving compensation\nwhen absence from employment\nwithout proper leave documentation,”\nand “payroll fraud/embezzlement\n— falsifying timekeeping records,\nor when employees are not working\nwhile on the job.”\nIn a letter attached to the claim,\nHarrison says that from August 2016\nto the present, Griffin received compensation\nwhile not reporting for\nduty at the department.\n“In addition, he has not left forwarding\ncontact information to those\nunder his supervision and often was\nnot available during contact attempts\noccurring during normal working\nhours,” Harrison wrote. “Griffin was\navailable only via VIPD email which\nwas delayed or not deliverable, thus\nleaving him ineffective and not suitable\nto be classified as working telecommuting.”\nGriffin dismissed the complaints\nroll off services in the territory. He\nsaid his company empties “all the\nrear load bins on St. John,” and does\nemergency Waste Management Authority\nwork on St. Thomas.\nContacted by The Daily News,\nWaste Management Authority executives\nwere unaware Caproni and possibly\ntwo other haulers were walking\noff the job.\nRoger Merritt Jr., the newly hired\nexecutive director of the agency, said\nMonday evening he wants to meet\nwith all the contracted haulers to see\nwhat they are owed and come up with\na plan to get them paid.\n“I understand that the haulers need\nto get paid,” Merritt said. “We need\nto ensure we are able to make timely\npayments.”\nCaproni said he is willing to listen,\nbut the answer has to be that the\nWaste Management Authority comes\nup with payment for services already\nrendered.\n“The solution is, you pay your bills\non time,” he said.\nPatrick Charles, one of the vendors\nCaproni mentioned, said Monday that\nhe has “reasons to be on board” with\na work stoppage, though he couldn’t\nmake such a decision alone.\n“I realize that he is upset,” Charles\nsaid, referring to Caproni. “It is time\nfor anybody to get upset. I’m in\nagreement with him.”\nCharles said his firm empties bins\non St. Thomas and hauls trash from\nWaste Management Authority collection\nsites in a number of government\nhousing communities.\nRegarding how much Waste Management\nowes him, Charles replied:\n“It depends on what you call a lot.\nThey’re two months behind, now.”\nCaproni wouldn’t say how\nmuch Waste Management owes\nhim in total.\n“It’s a big amount of money,” he\nsaid. “I’m fed up with the whole\nthing.”\nCaproni said he estimated that\nWaste Management owes various\nvendors millions of dollars.\nThe Waste Management Authority’s\ninability to pay vendors has been\na topic during Senate testimony over\nthe years.\nSteve Aubin, who was interim executive\ndirector of the Waste Management\nAuthority for most of 2016,\nagainst him, and said he welcomed\nan investigation.\n“I want them to investigate because\nI’m hoping — when all is done\n— I’m hoping that maybe I can sue\nher for slander,” he said. “I have nothing\nto hide.”\nHarrison’s letter calls for Griffin to\nbe investigated.\n“While his explanation of absence\nhas been reported as a long term medical\nprocedure, due to the extraordinary\nlength of absence, previous absences,\nand non-contact information,\na full investigation is warranted to insure\nthe people of the Virgin Islands\nhave not been deprived of its funds\ndue to improper payroll deductions\nor notifications,” she wrote.\nThe complaint was one of 10 filed\nafter Harrison lost her job as director\nof the police department’s Training\nBureau, according to copies furnished\nby Harrison.\nShe filed a citizen’s complaint after\nher termination alleging that Police\nCommissioner Delroy Richards Sr.\nhad violated department policy and\nthat he had ignored requests for the\ncorrection of a violation.\nHarrison also filed a complaint\nalleging Griffin’s administrative assistant,\nLe-Reeda Lake, was absent\non sick leave for four weeks without\nprior notice; that special assistant to\nthe commissioner Capt. Mary Duggan\nhad potentially disclosed confidential\ndepartment information to a\nthird-party vendor for personal gain,\nand had used threatening behavior to\ncreate a hostile work environment,\nand that she had obstructed Harrison’s\nperformance of her duties.\nHarrison further alleged that Lt.\nMaria Colon-Jones had disrupted a\ntraining presentation, and she said\nher termination was retaliatory for\nasking for sick leave to be treated for\nZika.\nHarrison said that she eventually\nfled the Virgin Islands in fear of her\nlife and that the police department\nstill owes her $5,000 in back pay,\nHarrison said.\nHarrison said Monday she’s submitted\nher complaints to Gov. Kenneth\nMapp.\n“I was the director of training and\nwas fired without cause,” she said. “I\nhad filed several complaints.”\nHarrison said she requested 10 days\nof medical treatment off-island to combat\na Zika infection on Oct. 18.\n“Two hours later, I was terminated,”\nshe said.\nDocuments provided by Harrison\nshow she was suspended without pay\non Oct. 18, and terminated on Oct.\n28.\nGriffin said that while he was undergoing\ncardio rehab in Florida, he\nstarted hearing about issues involving\ntold the Senate Finance Committee in\nJuly that the contractors needed to be\npaid.\n“It is clear that the contractors\nare bearing the brunt while trying to\nprovide critical services in hopes of\npayment by the authority as soon as\npossible,” he said.\nAubin ran the agency after the retirement\nof May Adams Cornwall until\nMerritt was hired last month.\n“The financial condition of the\nVirgin Islands Waste Management\nAuthority is dire and requires immediate\nattention and relief,” Aubin\ntold senators in July. “The authority’s\navailable cash to pay its contractors/vendors\ntimely is critically\nlimited, resulting in delayed payments\nto its contractors/vendors;\ngrowing accounts payable, which\nis currently on the order of $10\nmillion for its major contractors/\nvendors; and non-compliance at the\nAnguilla and Bovoni landfills with\ncourt ordered mandates.”\nAn example of the outstanding\nHarrison. Ultimately, Richards made\nthe decision to terminate Harrison,\nGriffin said.\n“Subsequent to her termination,\nshe started sending complaints,” he\nsaid. “She said she heard that while\nI was away I was practicing law and\nnot really sick.”\nHarrison wasn’t his supervisor,\nand wasn’t aware of how the accumulated\nsick time was being used, Griffin\nsaid.\n“She submitted so many complaints\nagainst so many people,” he\nsaid. “It’s obvious that it’s frivolous.”\nThe complaints have not yet resulted\nin an internal investigation,\nRichards said.\n“I found she was too much of a\ndistraction for us to move forward\nwith the actions as required of us by\nthe mandates of our consent decree,”\nRichards said about his decision to\nterminate Harrison.\nHarrison had failed to submit to a\ndepartment background check in a\ntimely manner, Richards said.\n“The department brought her in\non an interim basis initially, and then\nshe was asked to comply with the\npackage that we provided in order to\nconduct a background investigation,”\nhe said. “She offered resistance. She\nbelieved she could complete her own\ntimeline.”\nHarrison said she had asked for 10\nobligations owed by Waste Management\nhas been highlighted for the\nlast two years in Senate testimony\nduring the budget process. For Fiscal\nYear 2016, the agency noted it owed\nvendor Gem’s Construction $200,000\nfrom fiscal year 2012 to pay for garbage\ncollection services on the island\nof St. Thomas.\nThe Waste Management Authority\nnoted that it was “unable to identify a\nrevenue source” to pay Gem’s for the\nyears-old debt.\nDuring testimony on the Fiscal\nYear 2017 budget, Waste Management\nagain listed $200,000 owed\nto Gem’s Construction for garbage\ncollection on St. Thomas. However,\nWaste Management officials said the\n$200,000 was owed from the 2011\nfiscal year.\nNo one from Gem’s Construction\nwas available for comment Monday\nafternoon.\nMerritt said he believes the Waste\nManagement Authority can address\nthe overdue debt owed to the vendors.\n“I think we can. We’ve got to get\na plan in hand and get them paid. If\nthey provide a service, they should\nget paid,” he said.\n— Contact Jonathan Austin at\n340-714-9104 or email jaustin@\ndailynews.vi.\nPolice: Ex-employee filing ‘frivolous’ complaints against top cops\n“\nThe solution is, you pay your bills on time.\n— Peter Caproni, owner of Your Environmental Services Inc.\ndays to secure her college transcripts.\n“My email specifically says I am\nnot saying I don’t want a background\ncheck,” she said.\nRichards said he ultimately directed\nHarrison’s complaints to the legal\ndepartment, but he said Harrison\ncontinued to send letters and emails.\nA response from the department’s\nlegal counsel provided by Harrison\nsays simply that Harrison couldn’t\nuse the citizen’s complaint process to\ncomplain about things that happened\nwhile she was the director of the\nTraining Bureau, and that each complaint\nwill be closed as it is received.\n“In some of her letters and emails,\nshe appeared very threatening,”\nRichards said. “In one of her emails\nshe wrote ‘You are sicker than a tree\nbranch that’s going to be cut down\nvery soon.’ It’s one ignorance after\nanother.”\nHarrison disputes that characterization.\n“I’m very professional,” she said.\nGriffin was on legitimate sick leave\nwhen he was in Florida, Richards\nsaid.\n“He was being treated and he entered\ninto a program in Florida,” he\nsaid. “The woman is on a witch hunt\nall over.”\n— Contact Brian O’Connor at\n340-714-9130 or email boconnor@\ndailynews.vi.\n4 The Virgin Islands Daily News VIRGIN ISLANDS\nTuesday, December 13, 2016\nPolice say woman tried to smuggle pot into prison\nBy BRIAN O’CONNOR\nDaily News Staff\nA Mon Bijou woman tried to sneak\ntwo bags of marijuana into Golden\nGrove, police said.\nSherifa Petersen, 27, faces a single\ncharge of introducing contraband\ninto prison, and was free on $10,000\nbail about six hours later, according\nto her arrest record.\nV.I. police arrested Petersen on\nFriday afternoon about 1:47 p.m.,\nafter corrections officers discovered\nBy BRIAN O’CONNOR\nDaily News Staff\nthe marijuana hidden in the personal\nbelongings of inmate Omari Gordon,\naccording to Petersen’s arrest log.\nRick Mullgrav, Director of the Bureau\nof Corrections, said corrections\nofficers discovered the marijuana\nduring a routine search.\nPetersen “was bringing a package\nfor her companion, and I will\nsay her companion, because I’m not\nsure what the relationship was there,”\nMullgrav said. “She was coming to\nvisit, and she brought some drugs.”\nCorrections officers told police\nThe 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\nwill sit this week in the federal\ncourthouse on St. Thomas.\nJudges Kent Jordan, Michael Chagares\nand Thomas Hardiman will hear\na range of appellate cases, ranging\nfrom a local prisoner challenging his\ndetention as unconstitutional to an estate\nbattle over an inheritance in which\ntwo separate federal cases were merged\ninto one.\nThe judges fly in from Philadelphia\nto hear argument on issues they decide\nat a later date.\nAppellate court argument is based\naround rapid-fire questions from the\nempaneled judges, unlike civil or\ncriminal court, which frequently is\ndominated by long exchanges between\nthey had smelled marijuana in a pair\nof black Jordan sneakers Petersen\nwas bringing to Gordon, according to\na VIPD press release. When corrections\nofficers pulled apart the sneakers,\nthey discovered two small plastic\nbags of marijuana, according to the\npress release.\nAny material that ends up in the\nhands of prisoners is thoroughly\nsearched as a matter of routine, Mullgrav\nsaid.\n“We search any item that goes to\nthe inmates,” he said. “Generally\nattorneys and witnesses.\nThe appellant attorney gets four minutes\nto make a case, followed by four\nminutes from the appellee, followed by\nfour minutes of rebuttal from the appellant\nattorney, though judges’ questions\ncan sometimes turn four minutes into\neight.\nFor example, Ronald Gillette, incarcerated\nin 2008 on multiple counts of\naggravated rape and unlawful sexual\nspeaking, it’s pretty thorough.”\nGordon, 32, has been in jail\nsince police charged him with firstdegree\nattempted murder and firstdegree\nassault following a Nov. 29\nshooting on St. Croix, authorities\nhave said.\nGordon’s name also matches that\nof a man charged in 2010 with the\nmurder of 19-year-old Kendal Wood.\nGordon’s trial languished in the Superior\nCourt on St. Croix for almost\nthree years, and he was most recently\ngranted a continuance in 2013.\ncontact against two children, is seeking\nan appeal on a motion denying his release\nfrom custody.\nGillette’s attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo\nIII, began on Monday by making his\ncase that the motion, ordered by Chief\nDistrict Court Judge Wilma Lewis,\nconstituted a final judgement and thus\nwas worthy of an appeal. DiRuzzo\nsought a three-judge panel to overturn\nLewis’s order.\nIt didn’t take long for Jordan to ask\na question.\n“How can it be a final order if there\nare still claims in the case, if you’re still\nseeking relief, which you are?” he said.\nDiRuzzo had a response.\n“The denial of a three-judge panel\neffectively throws Mr. Gillette out of\ncourt,” he said. He started to add to this,\nbut Jordan cut him off.\n“There are claims for relief, they still\nexist,” he said. “I’m struggling to see\nhow this is a final judgement.”\nOrders relating to the change in\nthe reduction of a prison population\nessentially rely on three-judge panels\nto be valid, DiRuzzo said. Prison\norders issued by a single judge\nare subject to challenge on appeal,\nDiRuzzo said.\n“I would submit that three-judge\ncourts are desirable in confrontations\nbetween state and federal power,” he\nsaid.\nKimberly Salisbury was the Assistant\nAttorney General arguing for the\nappellee. Her job on Monday was to\ntell three federal judges that it wasn’t\ntheir job to decide Gillette’s case.\n“This particular order is just simply\nnot final,” she said, at one point.\nThe disposition of the murder\ncase involving Gordon couldn’t be\nimmediately ascertained Monday\nevening.\nGordon had been released on electronic\nmonitoring and house arrest\npending trial in 2013, according to\ncourt documents at the time.\nHe was being held on $500,000\nbail in his most recent arrest, police\nsaid.\n— Contact Brian O’Connor at\n340-714-9130 or email boconnor@\ndailynews.vi.\nFederal judges from Philadelphia in the Virgin Islands to hear cases\nPick 3 (Dec. 12)\nMorning\n1st prize 5 5 4\nMidday\n1st prize 8 7 0\nSunset\n1st prize 3 9 8\nEvening\n1st prize 0 3 7\nCaribbean Lottery\nPick 4 (Dec. 12)\nMorning\n1st prize 4 3 6 2\nMidday\n1st prize 2 3 0 4\nSunset\n1st prize 8 0 9 6\nEvening\n1st prize 7 5 8 0\nHowever, Hardiman had a question.\nIf there was an order short of Gillette’s\nrelease that could make the\nprison resolve the Eighth Amendment\nviolations that put the prison under a\nfederal consent decree for decades to\nresolve, Lewis or another judge could\nstill make the determination.

Kenneth Mapp said Monday\nhe believes the territory must accept a\nfederal court ruling that found a 2011\ngovernment employee pay cut unconstitutional.\n“After reviewing the case with the attorney\ngeneral and reviewing the case\nwith our financial team, I really am of\nthe mind that the government of the\nVirgin Islands should make good on\nthis claim,” Mapp said.\nHe said he wants the Legislature to\nsign on to a plan to pay the claim and\naddress other issues by approving increased\nsin taxes, taxes on time-share\noccupants, and changes that set a\nminimum tax for property owners who\nclaim tax credits.\nHe said the lawsuit judgement is valued\nat $65 million.\n“We will include all workers affected\nby the cut. In unions, all unions, and out\nof unions,” Mapp said.\nThe territory had asked the full 3rd\nU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider\nthe judgement, which was penned\nby three of the court’s judges.\nThe court rejected that request Monday.\nThe governor made his comments\nduring a press conference Monday\nmorning on St. Croix.\nThe conference originally had been\nscheduled for Friday on St. Thomas,\nbut was delayed for no stated reason.\nMapp also announced he has invoked\npublic exigency authority to\nfast track road repairs in the territory.\nHe described public exigency as\n“sort of a public emergency” declaration\nthat should allow the government\nto more quickly award repair contracts\nfor roadways that have deteriorated\nfollowing extensive rainfall.\nMapp said he has consulted with\nfederal authorities and hopes to access\nexisting highway project funds “to use\nthem to get the primary road system\nand secondary road system repaired.”\nHe said the work will be done\nunder existing federal road requirements,\nmeaning they include proper\ndrainage, sidewalks, striping and other\nelements, “all compliant with federal\nhighway and DOT standards.”\nRegarding the 3rd Circuit ruling on\nthe 8 percent cuts enacted through the\nV.I. Economic Stability Act of 2011,\nMapp said the territory could pay off\nthe amounts due to employees in two\nyears if plaintiffs in the case give the\ngovernment time to make good.\nHe said the payments can be satisfied\nif new tax collections from what\nhe called the Virgin Islands Enhancement\nand Economic Recovery Act,\nwhich must be approved by the Senate,\ntotal at least $80 million.\nHe said alcohol and tobacco in the\nVirgin Islands is sorely undertaxed,\nand 40 million bottles of beer are sold\neach year in the territory.\nAdditional tax also would be\ncharged on distilled alcohol and wine.\n“In addition, we are seeking at least\n$12 per carton tax on cigarette and\ntobacco products in the territory,” as\nwell as “a sugar tax on carbonated\nsweet beverages,” Mapp said.\nMapp suggested most of the millions\nof beers are consumed by tourists,\nso the tax would target visitors\nwho enjoy the territory and should\ncontribute to maintaining its infrastructure.\n“If you felt that was too expensive,\nthen stop drinking beer. That’s healthy.\nThat’s a benefit,” Mapp said, referring\nto locals who drink alcohol.\nMapp is also seeking a tax on timeshare\noccupants, and wants to require\nthat any resident claiming credits on\nproperty taxes pay a minimum annual\nproperty tax of $360.\nHe said the additional tax revenue\ncould also provide $18 million to pay\nworker’s compensation debts to medical\nproviders, hospitals and injured\nworkers in the territory.\nMapp said Monday that “as of today,”\nhe was not prepared to call the\nLegislature back into session to address\nhis proposal.\nSenate Majority Leader Sammuel\nSanes said Monday he hopes more\nrevenue could be generated through\nthe reopening of the St. Croix oil refinery\nto pay some of what Mapp wants.\n“We shouldn’t rely so much on\ntaxation. Right now, people of the\nVirgin Islands are facing a financial\nburden. Now we want to tax them\nmore. That is not appealing to me at\nall,” he said.\n“There are some good points” to the\ngovernor’s suggestions, Sanes said. “I\nsee his point. I can understand where\nhe is coming from,” he said.\nLame duck Sen. Clifford Graham\nsaid Monday that the promise to repay\ngovernment workers back for the pay\ncut won’t be enough to convince legislators\nto support Mapp’s proposal.\n“The governor has sent us his version\nof the deficit reduction strategy,”\nGraham said. There are parts that\nsenators will support, and “some we\ndefinitely would not be in favor of,”\nhe said.\nGraham said paying back the government\nemployees should be a priority.\n“Are they Number 1 on the priority\nlist? I think there are more critical issues\nnow,” Graham said.\nGraham said he is not sure whether\nthe 31st Legislature will consider\nMapp’s approvals before it stands\ndown this month.\n“I am willing and able to work until\nmy last day,” he said. “I am not sure\nthe calendar will afford us the time to\ndo so.”\n— Contact Jonathan Austin at 340-\n714-9104 or email jaustin@dailynews.\nvi.\nSenate Agenda\nToday\nThe Homeland Security, Justice\nand Public Safety Committee will\nmeet at 9 a.m. in the Lawaetz Conference\nRoom on St. Croix to get an\nupdate on the V.I.

Commercial versions\nof the powder also are available\nfor sale online.\nRecipients of Winston’s letters\nwere mainly witnesses who might\ntestify against Winston in her lawsuit\nagainst Scotiabank, and also included\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Ruth\nMiller, the legal counsel for Scotiabank\nand Winston’s former counsel\nin her suit against Scotiabank, according\nto prosecutors.\nBecause the envelopes had a\nreturn address of the U.S. Courthouse\non St. Thomas, “despite the\nfact that Winston was serving these\nsubpoenas herself,” some of the envelopes\nthat could not be delivered\nwere returned to the courthouse and\nopened by staff there, according to\nprosecutors.\n“Believing the powder to be anthrax\nor some other deadly biological\ntoxin, the United States Courthouse\nwas evacuated and closed;\nthe employees in the courthouse\nwho were exposed to the powder\nwere quarantined for hours,” according\nto the filing.\nThe incident caused significant\ndisruption at the courthouse and at\nthe private law office of attorney\nBennett Chan near the West Indian\nCo. cruise ship dock.\n“The purpose of lacing these envelopes\nwith hotfoot powder was to\ninstill fear and intimidation in the\nwitnesses to prevent their testifying\nagainst Winston,” according to\nprosecutors’ filing.\nThe filing does not indicate how\nauthorities determined the substance\nin the envelopes was hotfoot\npowder or what ingredients were in\nthe powder.\nWinston admitted to FBI investigators\nshortly after the envelopes\nwere received that she was\nthe sender. But Villegas has filed a\nmotion to suppress all of her statements\nto law enforcement, saying\nshe was not properly advised of her\nright to avoid self-incrimination.\nBut prosecutors shot back in\nMonday’s filing, saying there is no\nevidence in a video-recorded interview\nwith Winston that authorities\ndid not properly advise her of her\nrights or attempt to intimidate her\nto give a statement in any way.\nVillegas wrote in his motion that\n“the videotaped interview speaks\nfor itself.”\nHowever, prosecutors wrote that\n“the most cursory view of Winston’s\nvideo recorded interview with law\nenforcement agents establishes beyond\ncavil that Winston was never\ncoerced, was properly and repeatedly\nadvised of her rights, and\nconsciously waived those rights,”\naccording to Monday’s filing. “The\nfirst thirty seconds of the interview\nwholly defeats Winston’s meritless\nmotion.”\nWinston is scheduled to go to\ntrial on Jan. 11 before U.S. District\nJudge Juan Sanchez.\n— Contact Suzanne Carlson at\n340-714-9122 or email scarlson@\ndailynews.vi.\n\n10 The Virgin Islands Daily News Tuesday, December 13, 2016\nCENTENNIAL SCENE\nArchaeology in the Virgin Islands\nVirgin Islands\nlaborers excavate\npre-historic deposits\nat Magens Bay, St.\nThomas.\nThe Cuban Scientific Expedition to the\nVirgin Islands in 1951 was documented by\narchaeologists Oswaldo I. Morales Patiño,\nabove, and Fernando Royo Guardia, and\nsubsequently translated and annotated\nmany years later for the Virgin Islands Archaeological\nSociety in its Journal number\n5 (1978) by Alfredo E. Figueredo. Morales\nPatiño was president of the National Board\nof Archaeology and Ethnology within the\nMinistry of Culture and Education from\n1951-1955. During that same period, Royo\nGuardia served first as secretary and\nthen treasurer. The visiting Cuban scientists\nwere part of a commission formed,\namong other objectives, to study and\nidentify possible routes through which\nprehistoric cultures may have reached\nCuba, to seek evidence of the presence\nof common Cuban influences in Jamaica,\nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and to\nascertain the spread of Carib influence\nand identify the culture found by Columbus\non St. Croix. Welcomed in the Virgin\nIslands by Gov. Morris de Castro, they\nvisited and examined four sites. On St.\nThomas, they judged the Magens Bay site\nto be Arawakan culture with a few Igneri\nspecimens. Administrator Harry E. Taylor\naccompanied the visitors on St. Croix,\nwhere they viewed three more sites:\nChristiansted environs where they examined\nand collected a number of rimsherds\nand shell samples; the Salt River midden,\nwith its French fort earthworks foundation,\nwhere they were able to excavate pottery,\nstone, shell and shell bead specimens;\nand Estate Richmond, where they viewed\nartifacts, including some Igneri pottery,\nobtained by the owners from Salt River\nand from an Indian site on the estate. According\nto Figueredo, the “importance of\nthis work (by the Cubans) is not due solely\nto its reports of archaeological remains,\nhowever; it is also a historical document,\noffering us interesting information on the\nstate of affairs, beliefs, and personalities\nof its time. The Cubans came during one\nof our minor dark ages — when archaeological\nwork had come to a near standstill,\nand the history and historiography of the\n(Virgin Islands) ... were in abject abandon.”\nKatheryne Brooks Kay-Willock, archaeologist with the Conservation and\nCultural Affairs Department, studies the remains of what is believed to be\n1,000-year-old skeleton located at Hull Bay beach in 1974 in St. Thomas,\nat a proposed condominium project.\nPhoto courtesy of\nTHE VIRGIN ISLANDS,\nOUR NEW POSSESSIONS\nThe “ribbon-sealed” bottle, a P.F.\nHeering Company “Heering’s\nCherry Cordial” bottle produced\nin the period 1835-1850, was\nrecovered from the harbor in\nSt. Thomas, where many such\nitems have been discarded over\nthe centuries. The Schenectady\n(New York) Gazette of Jan. 7,\n1981, reported an upcoming\nlecture presentation to the National\nBottle Museum Society in\nBallston Spa, N.Y., on the “Buried\nTreasures of St. Thomas.”\nThe newspaper reported that\nlecturer Gary T.

The collection dates\nback to 1700. ‘I have never\nseen so many bottles come out\nof one dig,’ said Stephenson,\nvice president of the museum\nsociety.

He may want to make\na grand strategy statement, letting the\nworld know that he is going to shakeup\nthe global status quo.\nCalls to Taiwan, support for the Philippines\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte and\nmeeting with Japan’s Shinzo Abe have\nalready shaken up the foreign policy\nestablishment’s rules for protocol, as\nwell as approaches to human rights and\nglobal power relations. All this wellbefore\nTrump has even been sworn-in.\nOnce in office, Ronald Reagan began\nthe tradition of new U.S. presidents\nmaking Canada the first foreign presidential\nvisit. George W. Bush notably\nbroke from this tradition, making his\nfirst stop Mexico, a country he knew\nwell. He also hoped his trip and Cinco\nde Mayo parties on the White House\nlawn would attract Latino voters to the\nRepublican Party.\nTrump has already been to Mexico,\nmet with President Pena Nieto, gotten\na great presidential photo-op and\nmade his talking points. It is unlikely\nhe will be heading south of the border\nfirst.\nMaking a splash abroad will likely\nrequire a large rally — similar or bigger\nthan candidate Barack Obama’s visit to\nBerlin in the summer of 2008 — and\nmay be chosen based on the right mix\nof pomp, circumstance, strategy and\nsignificance.\nIf two big border nations are knocked\nout of the running for the primary reception\nof America’s new head of state,\nwhere might he go first?\nThere are any number of early supporters\nin other countries who could be\nrewarded and elevated by a presidential\nvisit. The scramble to send invitations\nto Trump Tower has already begun.\nU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May\nis considering an invitation on behalf\nof Queen Elizabeth II. Trump’s friendship\nwith and preference for Brexit\nleader Nigel Farage as Britain’s next\ndiplomatic envoy will require Trump to\nbalance Buckingham Palace pageantry,\nthe “special relationship,” Brexit forces\nand a potentially restive urban populace\nbefore deciding to touch down in London\nTown.\nNumerous foreign leaders supported\nTrump’s candidacy early on, mostly\nopposition politicians. A few, however,\nare running countries. They include\nHungary’s Viktor Orban, North Korea’s\nKim Jong Un, Zimbabwe’s Robert\nMugabe and, of course, Russia’s\nVladimir Putin. Rewarding them with\nan American inaugural visit would be\nrevolutionary and could set in motion\ndramatic changes in how America’s\nglobal relations, alliances and power\nbalancing is perceived and conducted.\nBig, bold, groundbreaking unprecedented\nmoves were the hallmark of\nTrump’s campaign: Is there a reason\nto believe he would take a different approach\nto governing? Trump’s brand of\npolitics is proudly unconventional —\nfrom his brand management business\nto his Fifth Avenue transition tower to\nhis tweet-centric campaign.\nWhere will he go? Japan, Russia,\nChina, Italy, Germany, France — maybe\neven India, Australia or Argentina?\nTipping favor toward any of the G8\nmember countries other than Canada\nfor a “first visit” would create both\nnew foreign policy opportunities and\nchallenges.\nTo avoid granting any nation the\nfavor of a first foray, however, he may\ndecide never to leave the country at all,\nrequiring all foreign leaders visit him at\nTrump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, the Trump\nNational Golf Club Bedminster … or\nmaybe even the White House.\n— Markos Kounalakis is a\nsenior fellow at Central European\nUniversity and visiting fellow at the\nHoover Institution.
