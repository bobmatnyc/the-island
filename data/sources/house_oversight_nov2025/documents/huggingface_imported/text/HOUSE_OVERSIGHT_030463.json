  "text": "When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that “Andy’”—as\nJeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one\nthing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking about far more than “Andy” does.\nWhich is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him.\n\nAnd Ghislaine?\nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.\n\nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours talking to her about\nthe third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom\nof the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away\nalmost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for\nhours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party ofher best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, (known\nfondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she\nreally cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.\n\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then\nJeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her\nfather, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s\nfather was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To\nGhislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that strange.\n\nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end\neither have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid\npaying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most\nbalanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second\n“wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.\n\nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends\nlike Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she’|] be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one\nsees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes.\n\nBis 2fe 2A 24s 2s 2s 24s ois 2fe ois fe 2fs of 2c ois 2fe ois fe of 2s ofc ois 2fe ois fe ois fe 2c ois ofc ois 2fe 2s fe 2c ois 2fe ois 2fe os fe ofc ois 2fe ois 2fe 2s oie 2c ois ofc ois 2fe ois oie 2 ois 2 ok\n\nThe information contained in this communication 1s\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and 1s intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
