Next generation theory measures cash flow rate of total capital, which\nsimplifies to the pure consumption rate, at 3.5% a year as a reciprocal of the\ngeneration length. I argued that the risk component in rate of return is captured in\ncash flow rate, rather than growth rate, that return at any given moment varies only\nwith risk, and that human capital as a whole should prove the riskier and higher-\n\nreturn factor. Then f(H) should prove generally higher than 3.5% per year.\n\nThat could give the key to quantifying collective human capital through (A6.3). I will\n\nnot attempt that step here. A reason is that national accounts reflect pay mixed with\n\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 15\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011141",
