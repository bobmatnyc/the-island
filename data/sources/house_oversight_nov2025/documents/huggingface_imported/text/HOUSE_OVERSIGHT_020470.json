Although most members of\nCongress accepted the Ford administration’s cautious approach to China as wise, many were\ncircumspect about the merits of China’s political, economic, social, and value systems, then\nexperiencing the last turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and the decline and death of Mao\nZedong in 1976,\n\nThese congressional visits to China seemed to help the Chinese government improve its\nstanding with Congress and favorably influence American public opinion. The resulting\nreports show how granting these delegations access to China’s leaders and elements of\nChinese society that Beijing wished to highlight proved an effective strategy of calming\ntensions. And the costs for Beijing were limited to modest in-country expenses, since\nthe members usually traveled as official congressional delegations on US government\naircraft.\n\nOne notable feature of this historical episode was the remarkable role played by Senate\nMajority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-MT). Senator Mansfield was widely consulted in\nWashington as an Asian affairs expert, meaning his observations arguably had more\ninfluence than those of other members. He visited China three times during this period,\npublishing separate reports with detailed assessments of various issues of concern to\nAmericans at the time. In the main, his reports conveyed information and opinions that\nconformed with Chinese interests. Unlike many other members favoring a more cautious\npace of normalization with China and sustained ties with Taiwan, Senator Mansfield urged\nthe United States to promptly end ties with Taiwan and accept Beijing’s conditions for\nnormal diplomatic relations, warning that to do otherwise would lead to dangerous friction\nin Sino-American relations and instability in Asia. Senator Mansfield portrayed China as a\npower with fundamentally peaceful motives in international affairs and placed much of the\nblame on the United States for past Sino-American conflicts in Asia. He also contradicted\nthose members who worried that China’s leadership change could lead to internal struggles\naffecting China’s international and domestic policies. He insisted that such skepticism was\nunwarranted, because what he called the Maoist system had been effectively inculcated\namong the Chinese people. Some members complained that the limited itinerary for\ncongressional visits that was furnished by Chinese hosts did not provide a basis for any\nmeaningful assessment of conditions there. Despite the fact that many congressional\nvisitors questioned how durable China’s Maoist regime was and how lasting China’s\ncooperation with the United States would actually prove to be, Mansfield countered that\n\nhe had had enough opportunity during his three visits to the PRC to move about and\nobtain enough information through on-the-spot observation and talks with PRC leaders\n\nto conclude that it was no passing phenomenon. So, while many members thought the\nPRC’s system of indoctrination and control to be repressive politically, economically, and\nsocially—an affront to the human rights and dignity of its people—voices like Mansfield’s\nserved to mute the criticism, maintaining that the country’s political, economic, and social\nsystem was uniquely well suited to the Chinese people.\n\nSection 1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020470",
