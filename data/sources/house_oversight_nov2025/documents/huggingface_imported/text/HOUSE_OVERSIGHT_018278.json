  "text": "programmer’s line, runs on a very fast clock in a world of constant innovation, and it\napplies to nations and ideologies, your habits and mine. Think of General Liu again\nfor amoment: “A major state can lose many battles.” Those five lost American wars\nover the last 50 years weren’t fatal. They wore only a bit on our national pride and\nour position because they weren't strategic losses. But our next errors, which may\ncome without the firing of a single shot, could be far more costly because of the slick,\nstrategic slope on which we are now moving. “It is one thing to struggle heroically to\nget out of danger,” Liu wrote in another manifesto. “But it’s better to see the danger\nbefore it even begins to sprout.”5¢\n\nSix paradoxes trace the immensity of the gaps we now face.\n\nFirst: We find ourselves confronted, almost daily, with an unnerving mismatch\nbetween our interests and our means. The most powerful nation in human history\nfinds itself unable to achieve even simple military and diplomatic goals.\n\nSecond: A global crisis of faith in our institutions is now under way. No significant\ninstitution, from the US congress to the Euro to your local newspaper, is more\ntrusted than it was a decade ago. Many of our most essential institutions seem\ndestined to be victims to the logic of “forced obsolescence” that makes our phones,\nour cars and our televisions of ten years ago feel like antiques.\n\nThird: The connected age lets us see and measure, with historic precision, the\nproblems we face - yet we can do almost nothing about them. Global warming,\nwealth inequality, species destruction, nuclear accidents, terror killings - we can see\nall of these in rattlingly sharp detail, instantly, miraculously. Watch the Fukishima\nreactor meltdown! See BP oil leak into the Gulf of Mexico in HD! The rise and fall of\nmarkets, the moves of distant wars, rivers of refugees appear almost as if we were\ntuning into a football game. But we can only watch. “Hey, do something!” we want to\nshout as we see financial or ideological or religious chaos spill towards us. But\nnothing seems to move; and what does move makes the problems worse. This\nimpotence of being “just spectators”, works like a nutcracker on the credibility of\nthe people and institutions we expect to fix these problems.\n\nFourth: Many new challenges exhibit a worrying non-linearity. Small forces produce\nmassive effects. One radical teenager, a single mis-placed commodity order, or a few\nbad lines of computer code can paralyze an entire system. The scale of this\nwhiplashing grows every day, because the network itself grows, it turns pindrop\nnoises into global avalanches. Dangers, accidents, crises were once local. A drought\nin California was, largely, a drought in California. A slowdown in China hit Shenzhen\nor Shanghai, not South America. Now, as networks overlap and influence each other,\ncrises cascade at a new, stunning and comprehensive scale. And while we know\n\n56 “It is one thing to struggle”: Liu Yazhou, “Tan junshi gaige yu quojia anquan\nwenti”\n\n46\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018278",
