But based on my recent trip across the region, a\nconfluence—Arab Spring and the technology that empowered it—has\nprovided the U.S. a new chance to push reset with a half-billion\nArabs, as long as it can shout louder than increasingly sophisticated\nbunk merchants like El Aschkar.\n\nAsk about basic political facts—al Qaeda’s responsibility for 9/11, or\nthe death of Osama bin Laden—and even the most educated will start\npopping off inanities.\n\nI’ve been dealing with this frustrating relationship for much of the\npast decade. Shortly after 9/11, in an effort to win Arab “hearts and\nminds” in the mold of the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe,\nthe State Department poured hundreds of millions into a new public-\ndiplomacy initiative, overseen by former ad executive Charlotte Beers\nand then Bush communications czar Karen Hughes.

With two colleagues, I traveled across\nthe Arab world—the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon, and\nMorocco—for two weeks on what we called a “listening research\ntour,” interviewing scores of young Arabs individually, in focus\ngroups and at giant roundtables, using Hi as proxy for the region’s\nperpetual question: what do you think about the U.S.?
