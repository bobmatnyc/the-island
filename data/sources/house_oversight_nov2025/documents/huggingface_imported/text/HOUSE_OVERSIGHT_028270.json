I contacted Leon Panetta to see whether we could delay it.\nThe official reason cited by the Americans, when they agreed to do it, did have the\nmerit of being true: that Bibi was coming under pressure to shift our budgetary\npriorities away from defense toward social and economic issues. But Panetta\nunderstood that my request for a delay meant we were at least considering military\naction. He also realized that if we did launch an attack, it was in the Americans’\nown interest for their troops be as far away from Israel as possible. We agreed to\nreschedule the exercise for October 2012. That meant that if we did decide to\nattack, we’d have until well into September, when significant numbers of US\ntroops would begin arriving.\n\nAs we weighed our final decision, I held a series of high-level meetings in\nWashington: with Panetta, national security adviser Tom Donilon, Hillary Clinton,\nand President Obama himself. Though not explicitly saying we were ready to\nattack, I left no doubt that we were seriously considering it, and explained the\nreasons we believed our country’s fundamental security interests might make it\nnecessary. The message from all of the Americans I met was that the\nadministration shared our basic goal: to prevent, or at least seriously impair, Iran’s\ndrive to get a nuclear bomb. But they continued to believe that non-military\npressure was the best way to do it.\n\nThe Americans knew we were skeptical that the non-military route would work,\nand that we were deeply worried about the implications of not taking military\naction if it failed. I discussed our thinking — and, in general terms, our plans — in\nmy meetings with Panetta. He already had a pretty good idea of the broad contours\nof what we were contemplating, since US radar systems and electronic intercepts\nhad been recording the volume and nature of air force exercises we’d been\nconducting over recent months. Leon and I had by now got to know each other\nwell, having first met when he was in charge of the CIA at the start of the Obama\nadministration. In one of our early meetings at CIA headquarters in Langley, there\nhad been a small bunch of grapes on his desk and I plucked a few in my mouth\nwith obvious enjoyment. Now, at the Pentagon, he had a big bowlful ready\nwhenever we met. The fact that he opposed an Israeli military operation made him\nno less of a pleasure to deal with. He was unfailingly calm and even tempered. He\nhad an encyclopedic grasp of issues of defense, intelligence, budgets and policy.\nHe was always rock-solid in America’s commitments to Israel.
