Again, both to conceal his relationship with Epstein and to discredit Roberts,\nDershowitz has repeatedly asserted that he was never in Epstein’s residence in the presence of\nyoung women. As both Dershowitz and Epstein know, that assertion was also false. As Mr.\nRodriguez has confirmed, there were “also young ladies in the house at the time he [Dershowitz]\nwas there”. Mr. Rodriguez also confirmed that “Mr. Dershowitz was there” when “women came\nto Mr. Epstein’s home to give a massage”. Mr. Rodriguez also confirmed that “Alan Dershowitz\nwas at the house” with “the local Palm Beach girls” who he was “told to call masseuses”,\nalthough he did not himself know whether or not Dershowitz personally received a massage.\n\n58. Maria Farmer was an employee of Epstein responsible for “manning the front\ndoor at his New York mansion and keeping records of people who came to the home” (Exhibit\n12, 92).\n\n(a) Ms. Farmer “witnessed a number of school age girls coming to the house,\nsome of the young girls would be wearing their school uniforms”... who “then\nwould be escorted upstairs” (Exhibit 12, 3).\n\n(b) Ms. Farmer was told these young girls “were interviewing for modeling\npositions” even though “it did not seem credible to me that these young girls were\ninterviewing for modeling positions”. (Exhibit 12, { 3).\n\n59. Ms. Farmer asserts that “Alan Dershowitz was an individual who came to visit\nEpstein at his New York mansion a number of times when I was working for Epstein.\nDershowitz was very comfortable at the home and would come in and walk upstairs. On a\nnumber of occasions I witnessed Dershowitz at the NY mansion going upstairs at the same time\nthere were young girls under the age of 18 who were present upstairs in the house” (Exhibit 12, J\n\n4),\n\n15\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017949",
