  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nlast time I was physically threatened for what I believe. Free speech is anything but free in the\nreal world of high passions and violent tempers.\n\nIt is imperative that those of us who defend the rights of bigots and others to express horrible\nviews go out of our way to challenge these bad views in the marketplace of ideas. It is a\ncommonplace among civil Libertarians that the appropriate answer to bad speech is good speech,\nnot censorship. We must provide that good speech as we defend the bad speech.\n\nI had the opportunity to do just that when the actress Vanessa Redgrave had a scheduled\nperformance with the Boston Symphony Orchestra cancelled because of her controversial political\nviews and activities. I defended her right to perform but challenged her to a debate about her\noutrageous political views. She declined because she was on the Central Committee of the\nRevolutionary Workers Party — a British Stalinist group — and the Party had to approve in\nadvance everything she said in public. I then explained the hypocrisy of her complaints about\nbeing “blacklisted” for her political views and activities, while she herself, and her Party,\nadvocated the blacklisting of others.\n\nIn 1978, Redgrave had offered a resolution demanding that the British Actors Union blacklist\nIsraeli artists and boycott Israeli audiences. The resolution included a “demand” that “all\nmembers working in Israel terminate their contacts and refuse all work in Israel.” Several years\nlater, she justified as “entirely correct” the blacklisting of Zionist speakers at British universities.\nAnd she has praised the ultimate form of censorship: the political assassination of Israeli artists,\nbecause they “may well have been enlisted ... to do the work” of the Zionists.\n\nRedgrave herself has used her art “to do the work” of terrorists. In 1977, she made a film calling\nfor the destruction of the Jewish state by armed struggle. She has personally received training in\nterrorism at camps from which terrorist raids were staged. She advocated the assassination of\nNobel Peace Prize winner Anwar Sadat. After playing her controversial role as concentration\ncamp survivor in Arthur Miller’s 1980 teledrama “Playing for Time” she traveled around the\nworld arguing that her selection for the role constituted a propaganda victory against Israel.\n\nIn 1982, the Boston Symphony Orchestra hired Redgrave to narrate several performances of\nStravinsky’s opera-oratorio “Oedipus Rex”. There is some dispute over whether she was hired\nentirely because of her unquestionable acting ability or also because of her political “courage.” As\nsoon as the decision was announced, there was outrage among some of the orchestra’s musicians,\nsubscribers and board members. Some musicians suggested that they would exercise their own\nfreedom of association by refusing to perform with a terrorist collaborator who justified\nassassination of artists.\n\nAt the end, the orchestra decided — wrongly, in my view — to cancel the performances of\n“Oedipus Rex”. They offered to pay Redgrave the money she would have received if the show\nhad gone on. Redgrave declined the offer and sued the orchestra for breach of contract, seeking\n$5 million in damages. She claimed that the effect of the cancellation was that she was\n“blacklisted” by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and could no longer find appropriate work.\nThe orchestra board responded that Redgrave has earned more money since the cancellation than\nbefore it, and that if anyone has refused to hire her, it is because she has used her art to serve the\n\n144\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017231",
