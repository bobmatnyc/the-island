Einstein would be horrified.\nRealism is violated by the quantum world: reality and measurement are\nintertwined.\n\nThe Kochen-Specker paradox shows us that a particle only makes\nits choice at the point of measurement. This does not prove it has free\nwill as it might still be told what to do by some external entity. It’s rather\nlike the famous game show, Who Wants to be a Millionaire? The particle\ncould answer the spin question in four possible ways. First, it could know\nthe answer, but we have just proven it does not. Second, it could phone a\nfriend obtaining the answer from some cosmic arbiter. Third, it could ask\nthe audience and take a vote from all the particles around it. Finally, it\ncould freely choose, without recourse to any of the other possible options\n— in other words, it would guess!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016037",
