Still, he was convinced that if we could demonstrate a toughness,\ncommitment and competence which offered an obvious addition to Israel’s\nintelligence capability, even they would recognize the folly of not using it.\n\nHe made every one of us feel a part of making this possible. I was one of ten\nnew recruits, bringing the size of the sayeret to twenty. We were almost all\nteenagers. In fact, the oldest of our officers was 21. Most of the men were\nSephardi Jews. For a unit like ours, with the aim of undertaking secret missions\nin Arab countries, Avraham believed that a background in Arabic culture and\nlanguage was an important asset. I was the sayeret’s only lock-picker. But all of\nus had been recruited in the much same way that I was. It was how the top\nPalmach units had been formed, and the way Sharon assembled Unit 101:\nfriends recommending friends, in my case, my old yeled chutz schoolmate from\nthe kibbutz.\n\nWe trained in the whole range of commando skills. We used not only Uzis,\nbut Soviet-made Kalashnikovs and Gurionov machine guns. We worked with\ndetonators and explosives. We staged raids on Israeli airfields. We conducted\nexercises using rubber dinghies to practice attacking from the sea. But mostly\nwe walked. For hundreds of miles, almost always at night the length and breadth\nof the country. We would study a map of each area, committing every town or\nvillage, hilltop or dry creek bed, to memory before we set off. I can still\nremember what Meir Har-Zion told us: to be truly prepared, you needed to\nspend “an hour for an hour” — an equal time mastering the lay of the land to the\namount you’d need to carry out an operation. It was a gruelling regime —\ndesigned to push us to the very limits of endurance. On one series of exercises,\nwe were limited to a single canteen of water as we trekked deep into the Negev\nDesert. It was gruelling, designed to push us to the very limits of endurance. I\nremember the first time Errol set eyes on me after I joined the unit. He turned to\nAvraham, laughed, and said: “Are we taking high school kids now?” But before\nlong, I was a “high school kid” no longer.\n\nMeir Har-Zion rarely took a direct part in our exercises. On his final\nCompany A mission, a month before the 1956 war, he had been shot in his\nthroat and arm. A medic saved his life by performing a tracheotomy. But his\nspeech was affected, and he still had almost no use of his right arm. Errol,\nMicha Kapusta and Yitzhak Gibli were more actively involved with us. They\nwere there not only to help train us, but to instill a commando aftitude, a spirit\nof confidence bordering on bravado.\n\n59\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011530",
