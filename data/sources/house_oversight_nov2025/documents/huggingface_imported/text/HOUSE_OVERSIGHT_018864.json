Russell said he was\ntold that Williams had surrendered to law.enforcement\nofficers.\n\n“He tumed himself in, that’s what I understand,”\nRussell said.\n\nRussell said he had no additional information\nThursday.\n\nIn October 2011, about 25 federal and local law\nenforcement officers raided the St. Thomas Senate\nbuilding and Williams’ office.\n\nA federal grand jury handed up an indictment\nThursday charging Williams, Blackett and a third person\nwith operating and participating in cnmuinal activities\nincluding bribery, wire fraud and mail fraud, U.S.\nAttomey for the District of the Virgin Islands Ronald\nSharpe said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe indictment has not yet been posted by the District\nCourt. However, the statement from Sharpe includes a\nnumber of details from the charging documents includ-\ning that Williams is accused of:\n\n« Attempting to bribe Public Works Commissioner\nDarryl Smalls with $10,000 in cash.\n\n* Accepting bribes from the developers of Raphune\nVistas.\n\n+ Accepting $35,000 in bribes from the developers o\nthe wind turbines at Tutu Park Mall. -\n\n* Soliciting kick-backs from his own staffin exchange\nfor salary caises.\n\n* Committing wire fraud by using public fimds to pay\nfor courses and having staff members submit work in\nhis name to obtain an online degree in his name from\nUniversity of Phoenix.\n\nAccording to Sharpe, if Blackett and Williams are\nconvicted, they face a maximum 20-year prison sen-\ntence and up to $250,000 in fines.\n\nPublic Works\n\nOn Sept. 5, 2009, Williams gave the V.I. Public\nWorks Commissioner $10,000 in cash in an attempt\nto bribe him to give contracts to Ace Development\nInc., a company in which Williams had an interest,\nSharpe said.\n\nIn his answers to a Daily News candidate question-\nnaire for the 2006 Voter Guide, Williams said he was\nthe owner of Ace Development Inc.\n\nAt the time, Darryl Smalls was the Public Works\nCommissioner. When The Daily News reached Smalls\non Thursday night, he said he had no comment.\n\nSen. Alvin Williams Jr.\n\nRaphune Vistas\n\nBetween Feb. 21, 2007, and Nov. 18, 2011,\nWilliams solicited a bribe from the developers of the\nRaphune Vista housing development project on St.\nThomas, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office. The\nindictment says Williams promoted legislative action\nand supported the authorization of funding and zon-\ning of the project in exchange for which Ace\nDevelopment received a contract related to the con-\nstruction of Raphune Vistas, Sharpe said.\n\nAs part of the contract, Ace Development used\nand/or rented construction equipment to the develop-\ners, Sharpe wrote. =\n\nIn May 2009, the Senate approved a zoning change\nfor Oceanside Village Inc., the developers of Raphune\nVistas, from R-1, residential low density one- and\ntwo-family, to R-4, residential medium density —\nagainst the recommendations of the V.I. Department\nof Planning and Natural Resources.\n\nIn June 2009, Gov.

The legislation also would\nhave allowed wholesale renewable energy production\nin B-4 and B-3 zones.\n\nThe measure was line-item vetoed by deJongh in\n\nJuly 2009.\nCampaign funds and false reports\n\nFrom January 2006 to December 2011, Williams | senator, St. ThomasSt.\n\nand a legislative staff member failed to deposit cer- |\n\ntain campaign contributions; withdrew funds froma |\ncampaign account; and submitted false campaign dis- |\nclosure reports that failed to include certain contribu- |\n\ntions, according to Sharpe.\n\nKick-backs from staff\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Williams tried to solicit\n\nkick-backs from his own staff in exchange for giving | e member of Rules and\n\nthem salary increases, the statement from the US.\nattomey’s office said.\n\nAccording to Sharpe, the staff members were sup-\nposed to withdraw a portion of the increased salary in\n\ncash and give it to Williams.\nFrom September 2010 to July 2011, Williams\nreceived such a bribe, Sharpe said.\n\nUniversity of Phoenix\n\nFrom April 2007 to February 2008 and from January\n2008 to October 2011, Williams and a staff member\ncommitted federal wire fraud as the senator sought\nonline degrees from the University of Phoenix.\n\n“The indictment alleges that the staff member\nfalsely submitted various documents that were gen-\nerated, created and authored by others under the\ndirection of and in the name of Williams,” Sharpe\nsaid in the statement.\n\nFrom January 2008 to October 2011, Williams and\nBlackett defrauded the government by using public\nfunds fornon-legislative purposes, namely pursuing an\nonline degree for Williams, Sharpe said.\n\n“As the law enforcementarm of the U.S. Department\nof Education, the Office of Inspector General will\naggressively pursue anyone who games the Education\nsystem for their own selfish purpose,” Special Agent-\nin-charge of the U.S. Department of Education Office\nof Inspector General Yessyka Santana said in a written\nstatement.\n\nThe investigation\n\nThe investigation leading to the indictment was\nconducted by the Public Corruption Task Force, a\njoint federal and local team.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S.\nAttomeys Kim Lindquist, Nolan Paige and Kelly\nLake.\n\n“The prosecution of public corruption is a top pri-\nority of the U.S. Attomey’s Office,” Sharpe said. “It\nis a breach of the public trust for public officials to\nuse their office for personal gain.”\n\n“These individuals have allegedly abused their\npowers by utilizing their positions to discreetly con-\nduct illegal activities,” IRS-CI Special Agent-in-\ncharge Jose Gonzalez said Thursday. “IRS-Clis com-\nmitted to following the money trail to ensure that\npublic officials who use their office to line their own\npockets are brought to justice and deprived of their\nill-gotten gains.”\n\nSharpe asked anyone with direct knowledge of ille-\ngal acts or information on corruption in the Virgin\nIslands to call the Public Corruption Task Force at\n715-6516.\n\n— Contact reporter Aldeth Lewin at 7 14-9111 or email\n\nalewin@dailynews.vi.\n\nAlvin\nWilliams Jr., 34\n\nDemocrat\n\nJohn District.\nMEBth, 2th\n\nLegislatures.\nCommittees: Chairman\n\nof Planning and\n\nEnvironment Protection;\n\nvice-chairman of\n\nGovernment Operations;\n\nJudiciary, Housing,\nSports and Veterans\nAffairs, Public Safety,\nHomeland Security and\nJustice; liaison to the\nU.S. Congress.\n\nEducation: 1996 graduate\nof Charlotte Amalie High\nSchool.\n\nClaims to have earned an\nAA online degree from\nUniversity of Phoenix,\nbut federal indictment\nputs that in question.\n\nCommunity positions:\nFormer president of St.\nThomas-St. John Horse\nOwners Association.\n\nPrior eniployment: Owner\nof Ace Development Inc.\nand general manager of\nAlvin Williams Trucking\nand Heavy Equipment\nRental, which his\nLegislature website says\nhas been “contracted\nby the federal and local\ngovernments to provide\nmajor development\nservices in the territory.”\n\nAlvin\nWilliams Jr's\nSenate staff\n\ni Kim Blackett, chief of\n\nstaff.\n\nGarry Sprauve, senior\nadvisor. ‘\n\nRasheen St. Juste,\nconstituent officer.\n\nPhillip Harrigan, public\nrelations officer- *\ncommittee coordinator\n\nJonee’ Edwards,\nadministrative\nassistant, legislative\naide.\n\nSources: V.|.
