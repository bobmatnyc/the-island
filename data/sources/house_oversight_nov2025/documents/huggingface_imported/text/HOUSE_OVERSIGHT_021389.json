  "text": "example, physicians may agree that the\nexperience of depression can be treated\nlegitimately by antidepressant\nmedications, referral to a psychiatrist, or\nreferral to a counselor whose practice is\nrooted in a specific religious tradition.\nYet our research suggests that the\nreligious characteristics of physicians\nstrongly influence which of these\noptions they would recommend in a\ngiven case’.\n\nControversies over a particular\nmedical intervention often represent\ndeeper unspoken disagreements that,\nunfortunately, science cannot settle. For\nexample, controversies over the use of\nstimulants to manage childhood behavior\ndisorders, or the medicalization of social\nanxiety, seem to reflect disagreements\nabout more basic questions: What brings\nhuman happiness? Which moods and\nbehaviors should be considered normal\nparts of human experience and which\nshould be considered abnormal? What\nsorts of suffering should we try to\nalleviate? What leads to disordered\nbehaviors? What resources (social,\npsychological, spiritual or otherwise) are\nbest suited to addressing disruptions in\nindividuals’ mental and emotional\nstates? How does modern medicine fit\ninto our response to these experiences?\nAlthough physicians may not ask or\nanswer these questions explicitly, they\nimplicitly answer them in their responses\nand recommendations to patients.\n\nSo, for all that is hoped for in\n‘scientific’ and ‘evidence-based’\npractice, clinicians must in the end act as\npractical moral philosophers, making\njudgments about how best to pursue the\ngoals of medicine for a particular patient\nin a particular context, all things\nconsidered. Among those things to be\nconsidered are moral valuations about\nwhich religions and other moral\n\n143\n\nPage\n\ntraditions have much to say, but about\nwhich medical science remains silent.\n\nCaring for the patient as person\n\nSo far I have suggested that\nreligions provide a vision that animates\ncare of the sick and a moral framework\nthat guides the application of medical\ntechnology. Religions make another\ncontribution by fostering practices that\nnurture the human capacity to care for\npatients as persons rather than as mere\nobjects.\n\nPatients commonly complain that\ntheir physicians treat them as mere\nobjects or specimens rather than\nappreciating and attending to them as\nunique persons. This problem has always\nplagued the profession. To learn how to\nheal, the novice physician must learn of\npatients as representing abstract general\ntypes and classes. She must learn about\ncoronary artery disease and hematuria\nbefore she can begin to interpret Mrs.\nSmith’s chest discomfort and Mr.\nJones’s red urine. These abstractions\nallow knowledge of when and how\nthings happen, and that knowledge\nguides technological interventions that\nmay bring healing to the body. These\nabstractions also help doctors objectify\ntheir patients’ humanity enough to\nviolate social norms that operate in every\nother social situation, such as asking\npatients to expose their nakedness in\nvulnerable positions, or cutting patients\napart in hopes of making them whole.\n\nAs long as the process does not\ngo too far, scientific detachment serves\nto make our concern effective. Yet the\ncollective experience of both patients\nand physicians suggests that such\ndetachment usually does go too far and\noccurs too easily. As a result physicians\ntreat patients as mere objects and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021389",
