Epstein has plenty of\n\nmoney, and craves power and access.”\n\nBannon made an early-morning beeline to Epstein, even though Bannon may have burned\n\nbridges when he savaged Ivanka Trump over her criticism of Roy Moore, whom Bannon\nbacked despite claims the candidate had sexually harassed teens.
