  "text": "54042\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nthe notice of a final rule, DOL rejected\ncommenters’ contentions that the\nExecutive Order and implementing\nregulation were preempted by the\nBoard’s jurisdiction under the Garmon\ndoctrine.188 Necessarily, this meant that\nDOL believed that the rule requiring\nfederal contractors to post the employee\nrights notice did not involve any rights\nprotected by Section 7 of the Act, such\nas a right to receive such information\nfrom their employer, or conduct\nprohibited by the Act, such as the\nemployer’s failure to provide such\ninformation.\n\nNot only does my colleagues’\nrulemaking action today contradict\nDOL’s preemption analysis, but its flaws\nare manifest in comparison to the DOL’s\nrule and the authority enabling it.\n\nConclusion!89\n\nSurely, no one can seriously believe\nthat today’s rule is primarily intended to\ninform employees of their Section 7\nright to refrain from or to oppose\norganizational activities, collective\nbargaining, and union representation.\nMy colleagues seek through\npromulgation of this rule to reverse the\nsteady downward trend in union\ndensity among private sector employees\nin the non-agricultural American\nworkforce. Theirs is a policy choice\nwhich they purport to effectuate with\nthe force of law on several fronts in\nrulemaking and in case-by-case\nadjudication. In this instance, their\naction in declaring that employers\nviolate the law by failing to inform\nemployees of their Section 7 rights is\nboth unauthorized and arbitrary and\ncapricious. Regardless of the arguable\nmerits of their policy choice or the\nbroad scope of Chevron deference and\nthe Board’s rulemaking authority, I am\nconfident that a reviewing court will\nsoon rescue the Board from itself and\nrestore the law to where it was before\nthe sorcerer’s apprentice sent it askew.\n\nV. Regulatory Procedures\n\nA. Regulatory Flexibility Act\n\nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980\n(RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires\nagencies promulgating final rules to\nprepare a final regulatory flexibility\nanalysis and to develop alternatives\n\n188 San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon,\n359 U.S. 236, 244 (1959)\n\n189 Because I find the rule is invalid, I find it\nunnecessary to comment on the content of the\nnotice or the consequences, other than finding an\nunfair labor practice, if an employer fails to post the\nrequired notice. For the reasons stated in my\ndissenting opinion in /. Picini Flooring, 356 NLRB\nNo. 9 (2010), I also disagree with the rule’s\nrequirement that certain employers must also\nelectronically distribute the notice.\n\nwherever possible, when drafting\nregulations that will have a significant\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities. The focus of the RFA is to\nensure that agencies ‘‘review draft rules\nto assess and take appropriate account\nof the potential impact on small\nbusinesses, small governmental\njurisdictions, and small organizations,\nas provided by the [RFA].” E.O. 13272,\nSec. 1, 67 FR 53461 (‘Proper\nConsideration of Small Entities in\nAgency Rulemaking’’). However, an\nagency is not required to prepare a final\nregulatory flexibility analysis for a final\ntule if the agency head certifies that the\nrule will not, if promulgated, have a\nsignificant economic impact on a\nsubstantial number of small entities. 5\nU.S.C. 605(b). Based on the analysis\nbelow, in which the Board has\nestimated the financial burdens to\nemployers subject to the NLRA\nassociated with complying with the\nrequirements contained in this final\ntule, the Board has certified to the Chief\nCounsel for Advocacy of the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA) that this\nrule will not have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial\nnumber of small entities.\n\nThe primary goal of this rule is\nnotifying employees of their rights\nunder the NLRA. This goal is achieved\nthrough the posting of notices by\nemployers subject to the NLRA of the\nrights of employees under the NLRA.\nThe Board will make the notices\navailable at no cost to employers; there\nare no information collection, record\nkeeping, or reporting requirements.\n\nThe Board estimates that in order to\ncomply with this rule, each employer\nsubject to the NLRA will spend a total\nof 2 hours during the first year in which\nthe rule is in effect. This includes 30\nminutes for the employer to learn where\nand how to post the required notices, 30\nminutes to acquire the notices from the\nBoard or its Web site, and 60 minutes\nto post them physically and\nelectronically, depending on where and\nhow the employer customarily posts\nnotices to employees. The Board\nassumes that these activities will be\nperformed by a professional or business\nworker, who, according to Bureau of\nLabor Statistics data, earned a total\nhourly wage of about $32.20 in March\n2011, including fringe benefits.19° The\n\n199 Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, “Economic News Release,” Table\nB-8, June 3, 2011 (available at http://www.bis.gov).\n(The Board is administratively informed that BLS\nestimates that fringe benefits are approximately\nequal to 40 percent of hourly wages. Thus, to\ncalculate total average hourly earnings, BLS\nmultiplies average hourly wages by 1.4. In March,\n2011, average hourly wages for professional and\n\nBoard then multiplied this figure by\n\n2 hours to estimate the average costs for\nemployers to comply with this rule\nduring the first year in which the rule\nis in effect. Accordingly, this rule is\nestimated to impose average costs of\n$64.40 per employer subject to the\nNLRA (2 hours x $32.20) during the first\nyear.191 These costs will decrease\ndramatically in subsequent years\nbecause the only employers affected\nwill be those that did not previously\nsatisfy their posting requirements or that\nhave since expanded their facilities or\nestablished new ones. Because the final\nrule will not require employers to post\nthe notice by email, instant messaging,\ntext messaging, and the like, the cost of\ncompliance should be, if anything,\nsomewhat less than the Board\npreviously estimated.\n\nAccording to the United States Census\nBureau, there were approximately 6\nmillion businesses with employees in\n2007. Of those, the SBA estimates that\nall but about 18,300 were small\nbusinesses with fewer than 500\nemployees.192 This rule does not apply\nto employers that do not meet the\nBoard’s jurisdictional requirements, but\n\nbusiness workers were $23.00. Table B-8.\nAccordingly, the Board multiplied that number by\n1.4 to arrive at its estimate of $32.20 average hourly\nearnings, including fringe benefits.) In the NPRM,\nthe Board estimated hourly earnings of $31.02,\nbased on BLS data from January 2009. 75 FR 80415.\nThe estimate has been updated to reflect increases\nin hourly earnings since that time. Those increases\nhave been relatively minor, and do not affect the\nBoard’s conclusion that the economic impact of the\nrule will not be significant; see discussion below.\n191 The National Roofing Contractors Association\nasserts (without support) that “federal agencies\nhave a notoriously poor track record in estimating\nthe costs of new regulations on businesses”; it\ntherefore predicts that “the actual cost for many\nemployers could be considerably higher.” The\nBoard recognizes that some employers, generally\nfirms with extensive and/or multiple facilities, may\nincur initial compliance costs in excess of the\nBoard’s estimate. For example, a company with\nmultiple locations may require more than 30\nminutes to physically post the notices on all of its\nvarious bulletin boards. The Board’s estimate,\nhowever, is an average for all employers; many\nsmall employers, especially those with only one\nfacility and/or limited electronic communication\nwith employees, may incur lower compliance costs.\nIn this regard, however, contrary to numerous\ncomments, such as that of St Mar Enterprises, Inc.,\nthe Board does not expect that the rule will be\n“very burdensome” for businesses with more than\none facility. Normally, such firms should have to\nlearn about the rule’s requirements and acquire the\nnotices only once, no matter how many facilities are\ninvolved. The same should be true for electronic\nposting: downloading the notice and posting it on\nan employer’s Web site normally should have to be\ndone once for all facilities. Thus, the only\nadditional costs involved for multi-facility firms\nshould be those of physically posting the notices at\neach facility.\n192 Source: SBA Office of Advocacy estimates\nbased on data from the U.S. Department of\nCommerce, Bureau of the Census, and trends from\nthe U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, Business Employment Dynamics.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022313",
