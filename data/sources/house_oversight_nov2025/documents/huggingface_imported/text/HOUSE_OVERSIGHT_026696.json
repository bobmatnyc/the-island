  "text": "Growth of the US for both returns and protection\nThe attractiveness of the US has been driven by\ninterest rate rises (with expectations for further raises\nthis year) and bond yields lagging in other developed\nmarkets (figure 8). There is also market confidence of\na ‘pro-business’ corporate tax regime following Trump\ntaking office in January 2017, causing sovereigns\n\nto note the growth potential of US equity markets\n(with 40% of sovereigns expecting to increase North\nAmerican allocations in 2017), as other developed\nmarket stocks remain flat. Currency strength\nunderlies this optimism (USD up 3% against EUR and\n20% against GBP in 2016‘), with some sovereigns\ndeliberately targeting dollar exposure through their\ninternational investments. Liability sovereigns noted\nthe dual benefit of the open currency position, both\neliminating hedging costs and generating additional\nreturns relative to home market currency.\n\nIn our 2015 sovereign study, we highlighted the\nattractiveness of real estate investments in developed\nmarkets. Under FIRPTA (Foreign Investment in\nReal Property Tax Act), sovereign appetite for real\nestate investment in the US has further grown. Most\nnotable, however, is the growing optimism around\nthe potential for new infrastructure deals in the\nUS following political campaigning suggesting an\ninvestment opportunity of USS1 trillion.\n\nDespite positivity, sovereigns in Europe and Asia\nnoted that successful US real estate investments\ngave no guarantee of similar opportunities within\ninfrastructure. Many respondents were concerned\nabout growing protectionism in the US, questioning\nif it might both limit access to infrastructure and real\nestate investments for foreign sovereigns and would\nhave long-term economic implications as foreign\nrelations are strained.\n\n1Source: XE currency data.
