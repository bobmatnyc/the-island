Some of the things that are in the\n\nreport aren't relevant to the case and, in fact, are going to\n\nbe highly prejudicial for the jury.\" That's why we're here\n\nthis morning asking for some of those things to be excluded.\n\nFor example, there are some references I won't\n\nbelabor the point -- but the references that we're making to\n\nsome of the illegal drug usage and so forth, that's not\nsomething we're trying to deploy affirmatively. The good\n\ndoctor simply listed all of the information that had been\n\nrecited as part of his report so that the lawyers and the judge\ncan now make a determination.\n\nAnd the fact that Ms. Giuffre told Dr. Kliman ina\n\nconfidential psychiatric examination certain things about drug\nuse can't possibly go to her reputation because no one was\nthere who was assessing what kinds of things might be going on.\nA similar point can be made about tax fraud. We're\ntold, \"Well, your Honor, tax fraud goes to her reputation.\" I\nsuppose that goes to her reputation with some IRS agent who is\n\nlooking at a return, but it can't possibly go to a general\n\nreputation that is at issue in this case.\n\nAnd once again, the cases that we cite in our briefs I\n\nthink make this point clear, there is a vast risk of\n\nprejudicial effect to Ms. Giuffre because the jury is going to\n\nthink, oh, she's a tax cheat, and they're going to hold that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011377",
