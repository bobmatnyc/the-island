But with ECB policy unlikely\nto become any more accommodative, additional\nvaluation expansion can no longer be taken for\ngranted. Instead, the onus for Eurozone equity\nupside now rests with earnings.\n\nHere, the prospects are favorable for several\nreasons. First, above-trend Eurozone GDP growth\nis likely to lead to boosted domestic sales and\nreduced economic slack, both of which have lifted\nEurozone earnings in the past. Second, the broader\npickup in global GDP growth we expect should\nbenefit the 45% of the EuroStoxx 50’s sales that\nare generated outside Europe. Higher revenue\nis particularly beneficial to these EuroStoxx\nfirms given their operating leverage, as small\nimprovements in sales spread over their sizable\nfixed costs also push profit margins higher. Finally,\nfinancial sector earnings stand to benefit from the\nhigher interest rates we foresee.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we expect earnings\nto expand 5% in 2017. Meanwhile, valuation\nmultiples are likely to contract slightly as interest\nrates normalize higher and investor focus shifts\ntoward eventual ECB tapering late this year.\nCombining these elements with a 3.6% dividend\nyield implies EuroStoxx 50 total returns of\n3% in 2017.\n\nThe risks to our base case are skewed mildly\nto the upside. After underperforming most equity\nmarkets in 2016, Eurozone equities have room to\nplay catch-up. Moreover, the passing of long-feared\nFrench and German elections could compress\ntoday’s elevated equity risk premium, although\npolitical uncertainty is likely to remain high in the\ninterim. Finally, investors’ recent shift toward firms\nmore exposed to the business cycle should benefit\nEurozone firms given their greater operating\nleverage (see Exhibit 63).\n\nWithin the Eurozone, we are overweight\nSpanish equities. Here, we are drawn to attractive\nvaluations (see Exhibit 64), domestic growth\nmomentum and embedded overweight to banks.\n\nUK Equities: Scaling the Wall of Worry\n\nWhile the Brexit vote was surprising, the\nsubsequent performance of the UK stock market\nwas even more so. Despite the tremendous\npolitical and social uncertainty engendered by the\nreferendum’s outcome, UK equities generated one\nof the strongest returns of any major equity market\nlast year in local currency terms.\n\nSeveral factors at the root of this\noutperformance should continue to work in favor\nof UK equities in 2017.
