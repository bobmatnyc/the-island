  "text": "any moment, and it pleased him that Bannon’s pronouncements and views would\nconsistently be fully formed and ever available, a bracing, unified-field narrative. As well,\nhe could turn him off, and Bannon would be tactically quiet until turned on again.\n\nKushner had neither Bannon’s policy imagination nor Priebus’s institutional ties. But,\nof course, he had family status, carrying its own high authority. In addition, he had\nbillionaire status. He had cultivated a wide range of New York and international money\npeople, Trump acquaintances and cronies, and, often, people whom Trump would have\nwished to like him better than they did. In this, Kushner became the representative in the\nWhite House of the liberal status quo. He was something like what used to be called a\nRockefeller Republican and now might more properly be a Goldman Sachs Democrat. He\n—and, perhaps even more, Ivanka—was at diametric odds with both Priebus, the stout-\nright, Sun Belt-leaning, evangelical dependent Republican, and Bannon, the alt-right,\npopulist, anti-party disruptor.\n\nFrom their separate corners each man pursued his own strategy. Bannon did all he\ncould to roll over Priebus and Kushner in an effort to prosecute the war for\nTrumpism/Bannonism as quickly as possible. Priebus, already complaining about\n“political neophytes and the boss’s relatives,” subcontracted his agenda out to Ryan and\nthe Hill. And Kushner, on one of the steepest learning curves in the history of politics (not\nthat everyone in the White House wasn’t on a steep curve, but Kushner’s was perhaps the\nsteepest), and often exhibiting a painful naiveté as he aspired to be one of the world’s\nsavviest players, was advocating doing nothing fast and everything in moderation. Each\nhad coteries opposed to the other: Bannonites pursued their goal of breaking everything\nfast, Priebus’s RNC faction focused on the opportunities for the Republican agenda,\nKushner and his wife did their best to make their unpredictable relative look temperate\nand rational.\n\nAnd in the middle was Trump.\n\nOOK Ok\n\n“The three gentlemen running things,” as Walsh came to coolly characterize them, all\nserved Trump in different ways. Walsh understood that Bannon provided the president\nwith inspiration and purpose, while the Priebus-Ryan connection promised to do what to\nTrump seemed like the specialized work of government. For his part, Kushner best\ncoordinated the rich men who spoke to Trump at night, with Kushner often urging them to\ncaution him against both Bannon and Priebus.\n\nThe three advisers were in open conflict by the end of the second week following the\nimmigration EO and travel ban debacle. This internal rivalry was the result of stylistic,\nphilosophic, and temperamental differences; perhaps more important, it was the direct\nresult of the lack of a rational org chart or chain of command. For Walsh, it was a daily\nprocess of managing an impossible task: almost as soon as she received direction from one\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019974",
