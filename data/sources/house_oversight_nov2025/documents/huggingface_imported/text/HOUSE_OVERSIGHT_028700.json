The Majlis al-Shura considers all\nelements of the group's activities, including\nits political and military wings, as part of\none holistic entity.\n\nAccording to Hezbollah's top officials, this\nunity of purpose among the group's diverse\nactivities is essential to its success. \"If the\nmilitary wing were separated from the\npolitical wing, this would have\nrepercussions, and it would reflect on the\npolitical scene,\" Qassem told a Lebanese\npaper in 2000. \"Hezbollah's secretary-\ngeneral is the head of the Shura Council\nand also the head of the Jihad Council, and\nthis means that we have one leadership,\nwith one administration.\"\n\nThe Jihad Council is the functional council\nunderneath the Majlis al-Shura responsible\nfor all military matters. Qassem writes that\nit \"comprises those in charge of resistance\nactivity, be that in terms of oversight,\nrecruitment, training, equipment, security,\nor any other resistance-related endeavors.\"\nTo accomplish its mission, the council is\ndivided into several smaller units in charge\nof protecting the leadership and carrying\nout internal and external surveillance, as\nwell as overseas operations. The party's\nsecurity branch is further broken down into\nthree subgroups: central, preventive, and\noverseas security. In 2000, a dedicated\ncounterintelligence branch was reportedly\nfounded as well.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028700",
