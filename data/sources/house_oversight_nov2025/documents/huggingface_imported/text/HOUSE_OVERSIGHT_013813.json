  "text": "reflect very distinct priorities and life philosophies.\n\nNote how subtle differences in wording completely change the necessary actions for fulfilling what at\n\na glance appear to be similar goals. These are not limited to business owners. Even the first, as I will\nshow later, applies to employees.\n\nNR:\n\nNR:\n\nNR:\n\nNR:\n\nNR:\n\nNR:\n\nNR:\n\nNR:\n\nTo work for yourself.\nTo have others work for you.\n\nTo work when you want to.\n\nTo prevent work for work’s sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (“minimum\neffective load”).\n\nTo retire early or young.\n\nTo distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life ona regular basis\nand recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is.\n\nTo buy all the things you want to have.\n\nTo do all the things you want to do, and be all the things you want to be. If this includes some tools\nand gadgets, so be it, but they are either means to an end or bonuses, not the focus.\n\nTo be the boss instead of the employee; to be in charge.\n\nTo be neither the boss nor the employee, but the owner. To own the trains and have someone else\nensure they run on time.\n\nTo make a ton of money.\n\nTo make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines and steps\nincluded. What are you working for?\n\nTo have more.\n\nTo have more quality and less clutter. To have huge financial reserves but recognize that most\nmaterial wants are justifications for spending time on the things that don’t really matter, including\nbuying things and preparing to buy things. You spent two weeks negotiating your new Infiniti with the\ndealership and got $10,000 off? That’s great. Does your life have a purpose? Are you contributing\nanything useful to this world, or just shuffling papers, banging on a keyboard, and coming home to a\ndrunken existence on the weekends?\n\nTo reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold.\nTo think big but ensure payday comes every day: cash flow first, big payday second.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013813",
