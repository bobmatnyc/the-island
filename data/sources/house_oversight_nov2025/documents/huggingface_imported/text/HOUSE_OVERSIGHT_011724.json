  "text": "Chapter Sixteen\n\nRabin had inherited a peace process, put in motion by the Bush\nAdministration after the Gulf War. But since both Prime Minister Shamir and\nour Arab enemies had reasons of procedure, politics or principle to resist the\ntalks, merely getting them off the ground had required the same combination of\ndeftness and determination President Bush had brought to assembling his\nwartime coalition and defeating Saddam. After a formal opening session in\nMadrid, the “bilateral tracks” — between Israel and negotiators from Syria,\nLebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians — had quickly stalemated and stalled.\n\nYitzhak came to office saying he was not interested in a peace process,\nwhich seemed to him a license for endless talk with no set endpoint, but in\npeacemaking. Since | had the good fortune to be part of the informal inner circle\nwith which he discussed the potential opportunities, pitfalls and frustrations\nalong the way, I know that he wasn’t assuming we could necessarily achieve a\npeace agreement with any of our neighbors. But after the twin shocks of the\nLebanon War and the Scud missiles, he was concerned that Israel would retreat\ninto a mix of political caution and military deterrence which he rightly believed\nwas short-sighted. He believed we needed at least to try to seize a “window of\nopportunity” with those enemies who were at least open to compromise, if only\nbecause we were facing new threats from enemies for whom talk was not even\nan option. An increasingly assertive Iran, with nuclear ambitions, was one. But\nthe intifada had also thrown up new Palestinian groups grounded not in\nnationalism, but fundamentalist Islam: Hamas in Gaza, which opposed Israel’s\npresence on any part of “Muslim Palestine,” and Islamic Jihad on the West\nBank. And in Lebanon, we were confronting the Iranian-backed Shi’ ite militia\nfighters of Hizbollah.\n\nEach of us in the small group on whom Rabin relied for input on the peace\ntalks brought something different to the mix. In addition to me, there were four\nother generals: Uri Saguy, the head of military intelligence; Gadi Zohar, in\ncharge of civil administration for the West Bank and Gaza; my own former\nsayeret deputy, Danny Yatom, who was head of the central command; and\nRabin’s military aide, Kuti Mor. Also included were longtime political and\nmedia aide Eitan Haber, and another trusted political adviser thousands of miles\naway: Itamar Rabinovich, our ambassador in Washington and Israel’s leading\nSyria expert. But I’m sure we weren’t chosen just for our insights. It was\n\n253\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011724",
