Maybe tomorrow?\n\nI will speak to Jeffery Epstein's lawyer but JE has a conflict with you and will want your silence as whilst you\nare being attacked there is less heat on him.\n\nEither is lying or not. If we let her lie without challenge then the lies become the reality and\nthat may lead to you facing investigation. These are serious allegations and In the UK prosecuting people who\nface allegations of sex abuse is now common place and a lot of resources are focused on this.\n\nWe can't sit back and let you be a conspirator by silence.\n\nYour are not guilty and must follow Dershowtiz line. He is a leading lawyer and he hasn't followed the don't say\nanything for fear of litigation. He has rightly called Pe biutt and shouted his innocence.\n\nYou have to stand up and deny the allegations or be branded guilty by association and that may lead to other\ninvestigations and worse.\n\nI feel I am going around in circles.\n\nI know what is right to do and that is to shout your innocence.\nTry and get some rest. Call me tomorrow if you want anytime.\nSpeak to Deshowitz.\n\nDon't allay yourself to JE as that is not the way to go.\n\nBest\n\nPhilip\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn 10 Jan 2015, at 16:02, \"G Maxwell\"\n\nwrote:\n\nIam out of my depth to understanding defamation and other legal hazards and don't want to end up in a law suit\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030296",
