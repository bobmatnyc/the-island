For example, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\nnow feature satellite campuses of major Western universities. One reason\nfor the shift is that the experience of other regions, such as Asia, has shown\nthat modernization does not simply equal westernization-that it is possible\nto pursue, say, economic and social development while still retaining\ndistinctive cultural characteristics.\n\nIt is true that a certain number of young Muslims will continue to choose\nrebellion against the modern world rather than integration into it, joining\nradical Islamist groups and trying to wreak havoc where they can. About\n30,000 Muslim fighters from all over the world, including the West, have\njoined the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). But however much they\nconstitute a major global security problem, they are dwarfed by, say, the 200\nmillion nonradical Muslims who live peacefully in Indonesia alone.\nIndonesia has elected two consecutive leaders committed to integrating the\ncountry into the modern world, and its largest Muslim organization, the 50-\nmillion-plus-member Nahdlatul Ulama, has publicly challenged ISIS'\nactions and ideology.\n\nThe real challenge, therefore, is not the Islamic world per se but figuring out\nhow to bolster the pro-modernization trends in that world while containing\nthe radical trend. In retrospect, it was a mistake for the West to have\nremained silent when Saudi funding dramatically increased the number of\nradical madrasahs around the world. A comparable investment today in\nbuilding a good modern school next to each radical one would create a\ncontest for legitimacy that would likely spread Enlightenment values far and\nwide. Such a program could be undertaken by the UN agencies UNESCO\nand UNICEF at relatively modest cost, and it is only one of many possible\nlines of advance in attacking the problem.\n\nCHALLENGING CHINESE\n\nThe second great challenge many worry about is the rise of China. China's\nsuccess, however, can also be seen as the ultimate triumph of the West. The\nemperor Qianlong famously wrote to Great Britain's King George III in 1793\nsaying, \"Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and\nlacks no product within its own borders. There [is] therefore no need to\nimport the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own\nproduce.\" Two centuries later, the Chinese understand that absorbing\nWestern modernity into their society has been crucial to their country's\nreemergence. It has led to rapid economic growth, new and gleaming\ninfrastructure, triumphs in space exploration, the spectacular 2008 Olympic\nGames in Beijing, and much more.\n\nEven as Chinese society has accepted modernity with great enthusiasm,\n\nhowever, it has not abandoned its Chinese cultural roots. The Chinese look\nat their modern Chinese civilization and emphasize its Chineseness, seeing\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026843",
