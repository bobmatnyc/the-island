Here are some examples of the\n\nOF H Q ARASH OK A\nAncient Greek, Japanese:\nKanji, Katakana, Chinese,\nand Russia-Cyrillic\nSymbols\n\ncharacters represented by Unicode.\n\nFor our discussion, it does not matter which language War and\nPeace is written in. We just treat the symbols as numbers. I am going\nassume the English translation which has around 500,000 words; a nice\nround number. Assuming a generous 10 characters per word, War and\nPeace is approximately 10-megabytes — that’s about the same size as a\nmusic track on iTunes. In practice, the book uses a bit more memory, as\nthere is some overhead for formatting information. My laptop has a 500\nGigabyte hard disk so I could fit half a million copies of War and Peace\non it!\n\nIf we take a look at the contents of the file on my computer the book\nstarts:\n\n8710110810844801141051109910144115111\n\nCan a computer calculate this number?\n\nThe obvious answer is YES. It is just an integer like 1, 3 or 42. Granted\nit’s a large number, but the length of the number is simply the length of\nall the symbols in the book coded into Unicode — about 10 million digits.\nWe have already determined this number can be stored on my hard disk\nhalf a million times, so it’s not an unimaginably large number. How long\nwould it take to calculate the number corresponding to War and Peace?\n\nThe simplest method is to count up starting at 1 then 2, 3, 4, 5, and\nso on until I try every number. Will this eventually get to the War and\nPeace number? The answer is yes. Eureka! All of human knowledge is\ncomputable. I have written this computation out as a simple computer\nprogram below. It says, in plain English, start at zero, go round a loop\ncounting up one at a time and print each number as you go along.\n\ni==0; Loop i++ Print i;\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015820",
