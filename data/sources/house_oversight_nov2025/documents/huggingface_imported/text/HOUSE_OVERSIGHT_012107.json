Epstein\n291874\n\nDATE: April 07, 2011\n\nJS: Virginia, Jack Scarola and Brad Edwards\n\nBE: Hi Virginia.\n\nV: Hi Jack! Hi Brad! How you guys doing?\n\nJS: | We’re doing fine, thank you. I’m sorry for all of the trouble and before we go any\nfurther, let me tell you, if I have your permission, I have started a tape recorder and I\nwant to be able to tape this conversation from the very beginning. Is that alright with\nyou?\n\nV: Sure, that’s fine, Jack. No problem\n\nJS: | Ok, good, thank you. I appreciate that. Let me start off by introducing myself. I know\nthat Brad has spoken to you about me but I am Brad’s lawyer, and I assume that you can\nconfirm that you and I have never had any communication before. Is that right?\n\nV: That’s correct.\n\nJS: Alright. I have, however, gotten some information from Brad about conversations that\nyou have had with him, and that will enable me, hopefully, to make this a little bit more\nefficient and take up a minimum amount of your time while still getting the information\nthat we think is going to be helpful to us and to any jury that might ultimately have to\nhear these facts.\n\nSo, let me begin by asking you first to tell us what your full name is.\n\nV: Virginia Louise Roberts. That’s my maiden name. My married name is Virginia Louise\n*\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012107",
