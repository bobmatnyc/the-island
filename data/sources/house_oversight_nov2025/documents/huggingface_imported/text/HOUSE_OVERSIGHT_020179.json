Mike Rogers, (R.-Mich.), her counterpart on the House\nIntelligence Committee, said on the NBC program, “Meet the Press,” that Snowden might be\nworking for a foreign intelligence service. And a former prominent member of President Obama's\ncabinet went even further, suggesting to me off the record in March this year that there are only\nthree possible explanations for the Snowden heist: 1) It was a Russian espionage operation; 2) It\nwas a Chinese espionage operation, or 3) It was a joint Sino-Russian operation. These severe\naccusations generated much heat but little light. They were not accompanied by any evidence\nfrom these Congressional leaders showing that Snowden had acted in concert with any foreign\npower in stealing the files or, for that matter, that he was not acting out of his own personal\nconvictions, not matter how misguided they may have been.\n\nOn this side of the divide, Snowden's critics regard the whistle blowing narrative as at best\nincomplete, and at worst fodder for the naive. They point out that the FISA document that gave\nhim credentials as a whistle-blower was only issued in the last week of April 2013, which was\nthree months after he first contacted Greenwald and almost 9 months after he began illegally\ncopying secret documents. They further believe that the evidence contradicts Snowden’s claims\nthat he stole only documents that exposed NSA transgression into domestic surveillance, that he\nturned over all the stolen documents to journalists, and that he was forced to remain in Moscow\nby the actions of the US government. They believe that all three of these claims, which are at the\nconceptual basis of the whistle blowing story, are false. They also find that the unprecedented\nsize and complexity of the penetration of NSA files, compromising hundreds of thousands of\nsecret documents pertaining to US operations against adversary nations, according to the NSA’s\nand Pentagon estimates, does not afford an innocent explanation for the volume of files he took.\n\nThe deep split in how Snowden is perceived brings to mind the famous drawing of a duck\n\n-rabbit cartoon first published in 1900 in the book Fact and Fable in Psychology. The figure is\nperceived either as a duck or as a rabbit but it cannot be seen as both simultaneously. Whether a\nperson sees a rabbit or duck in this test may depend on the information available to that person.\nFor example, if the person has never seen an image of a rabbit before, he will see almost certainly\nsee a duck; and vice versa.\n\nSimilarly, what may account for the sharp divide between the Snowden and anti-Snowden\ncamps is a disparity in the available information. The pro-Snowden camp's view is largely\ninformed by Snowden himself. It prefers to believe his words over his actions.\n\nIn the anti-Snowden camp are administration officials and the members of the House and Senate\nintelligence oversight committees who have been at least partially briefed on the continuing\ninvestigations of the Snowden affair. The members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, for\nexample, were briefed by David Leatherwood, the director of operations of the Defense\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020179",
