  "text": "Page 49 of 52\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *919\n\n(c) Victim's Right Against Delay. The court shall assure that a victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay is\nprotected. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any motion to continue any proceeding. If the court grants a motion to\ncontinue over the objection of a victim, the court shall state its reasons in the record.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nUnder the CVRA, a victim has a right \"to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\" 73! A number of states have similar\n332\n\nprovisions.\n\n[*920] The proposed rule would give effect to this right. Of course, in some situations, delay is reasonable. In others,\nhowever, the court should deny a motion to continue in order to wrap up the proceedings and possibly bring closure to a victim.\nAs Senator Feinstein has explained,\n\nThis provision does not curtail the government's need for reasonable time to organize and prosecute its case. Nor is the\nprovision intended to infringe on the defendant's due process right to prepare a defense. Too often, however, delays in criminal\nproceedings occur for the mere convenience of the parties and those delays reach beyond the time needed for defendant's due\nprocess or the government's need to prepare. The result of such delays is that victims cannot begin to put the crime behind them\nand they continue to be victimized. It is not right to hold crime victims under the stress and pressure of future court proceedings\nmerely because it is convenient for the parties or the court. 373\n\nThe proposed rule gives victims a right against unreasonable delay in subsection (c). To ensure that defendants’ rights are\nreasonably protected, a new subsection (b) is added recognizing defendants’ rights in the Speedy Trial Act. *34 The existing\nrule's direction to give scheduling preference to criminal cases would remain in subsection (a).\n\nThe proposal also gives victims the right to be heard on any continuance. This is consistent with the drafters’ intent, as at least\none court has already opined. 77° As Senator Kyl stated, \"This provision [in the CVRA] should be interpreted so that any\n\n331 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(7). Even before the adoption of the CVRA, child victims had the right to a \"speedy trial” in certain situations. /8\nU.S.C. 3509(j).\n\n332 See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-4435 (2001) (\"In any criminal proceeding in which a continuance is requested, the court shall consider the\nvictim's views and the victim's right to a speedy trial.\"); Ca/. Penal Code 1050(a) (2005) (stating policy of the California legislation that\n\"excessive continuances ... cause substantial hardship to victims and other witnesses ... . It is therefore recognized that the people, the\ndefendant, and the victims and other witnesses have the right to an expeditious disposition ... .\"); Del. Code Ann. tit. 1], 9423 (2001) (\"In\nruling on any motion or other request for a delay or continuance ... the court shall consider and give weight to any adverse impact such delay\nor continuance might have on the well-being of any victim ... .\"); 730 JI]. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3.](c) (West 2005) (\"Victim shall be\nnotified of the date and time of hearing [on any motion for continuance] and shall be provided an opportunity to address the court on the\nimpact the continuance may have on the victim's well-being.\"); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 46:1844 (1999) (\"When ruling on a defense motion for\ncontinuance, the court shall consider the impact on the victim.\"); Miss. Code Ann. 99-43-19 (2000) (\"The court ... should make every\nreasonable effort to consider whether granting [a] continuance shall be prejudicial to the victim.\"); Ri. Gen. Laws 1]-37-11.2 (2000) (\"The\ncourt shall consider any adverse impact the delay or continuance may have on the well-being of the victim ... .\"); Tenn. Code 40-38-116(a)\n(2003) (\"In any criminal proceeding in which a continuance is requested, the court shall consider the victim's views and the victim's right to a\nspeedy trial. If the continuance is granted over the victim's objection, the court shall state on the record the reason for the continuance and the\nprocedures that have been taken to avoid further delays.\"); vo. Stat. Ann. 1-40-207 (2004) (\"The court shall consider the victim's interest\nand circumstances when ... granting or denying continuances.\").\n\nSome states limit speedy trial rights to child victims. See, e.g., Ala. Code 15-25-6 (2000) (\"In ruling on any motion ... for ... continuance ...\nthe court shall consider and give weight to any adverse impact the delay or continuance may have on the well-being of a child victim or\nwitness.\"); Del. Code Ann. tit. 1], 5133 (2001) (same); Idaho Code Ann. 19-110 (2004) (same); Ky. Rev. Stat Ann. 421.510 (LexisNexis\n1992) (same); N.Y. Penal Law 642-a (2005) (same); N.D. Cent.
