  "text": "Could U.S. case against sex offender Jeffrey Epstein be reopened? http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/crime--law/fight-reopen-teen-s...\n\n2 of 4\n\ncase to any victim,” they wrote, urging him to uphold the provisions of the 13-year-old federal law.\n\nAt the same time, the stakes are equally high for Epstein, who has ferried President Bill Clinton on his\nprivate jet and counts celebrities, such as Britain’s Prince Andrew, as friends.\n\nMarra has already ruled that if he finds that federal prosecutors violated the act, he will consider\nthrowing out the plea deal that Epstein signed with federal prosecutors in 2007. Miami attorney Roy\nBlack, one of dozens of high-profile lawyers who has represented Epstein, claims that would be\nmanifestly unfair.\n\nAs part of the unusual non-prosecution agreement, which wasn’t shared with victims for nearly a year\nwhile and after it was being negotiated, federal prosecutors agreed not to pursue charges that could\nhave sent Epstein to prison for life. In exchange, Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty in Palm Beach County\nCircuit Court to two Florida criminal charges — one count each of soliciting a minor for prostitution and\nsoliciting prostitution. He served 13 months of an 18-month sentence in a vacant wing of the county\nstockade — a cell he was allowed to leave 16 hours a day, six days a week.\n\nEpstein, who now spends most of his time on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, also is\nrequired to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. In addition, as part of the plea deal, he paid\nroughly 30 women, who were identified by prosecutors as his victims, undisclosed amounts of money\nto settle civil lawsuits they had filed against him.\n\nTo throw out the deal after Epstein has been punished would rob him of his constitutional right to due\nprocess, Black wrote in court papers. “If a defendant lives up to his end of the bargain, the government\nis bound to perform its promises,” he wrote, quoting a prior court decision.\n\nHowever, Edwards and Cassell claim that because federal prosecutors didn’t confer with their clients\nabout the plea deal before it was made, they violated the law and that makes the non-prosecution\nagreement illegal. They cited examples where plea deals have been invalidated after judges later\nfound prosecutors violated the crime victims’ rights law.\n\nIn most of the cases they cited, the mistakes were the result of oversights. But Edward and Cassell\nwrote, “The undisputed facts of this case prove that, rather than forthrightly discharging its obligations\nto numerous child sexual assault victims, the government chose to enter into a secret deal with the\nman who had victimized them.”\n\nFederal prosecutors have said they didn’t reveal the terms of the non-prosecution agreement because\nthey feared Epstein and his high-powered attorneys were trying to circumvent it. Still, Edwards and\nCassell, said there was no justification for the secrecy.\n\n“The government’s conduct here was particularly egregious, because it repeatedly found time to confer\nwith attorneys for Epstein — the man who sexually abused the victims,” they said of emails and\nmeetings between federal prosecutors, including U.S. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, who was then\nU.S. attorney for South Florida.\n\nIn an affidavit, Edwards said Assistant U.S. Attorney Marie Villafana, who was handling Epstein’s case,\nhad numerous chances to tell him and the young women he represented about the non-prosecution\nagreement. Instead, four months after the agreement was signed in September 2007, federal officials\nwrote victims letters, assuring them the case was still under investigation.\n\n“This can be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation,” officials wrote in a January 2008 letter to Edwards’ clients.\n\nIn court papers, Villafana said she alerted Edwards the day before Epstein was to plead guilty in circuit\ncourt, hoping that Edwards, his clients and other alleged victims would attend the hearing. But\nEdwards said neither he nor the young women had any idea that the plea in state court meant Epstein\nwouldn’t be prosecuted for federal crimes.\n\n“The victims (and their attorneys) could hardly have expected that the prosecutors and the man who\nhad sexually abused them would be working together to conceal an arrangement that would prevent\nhis prosecution for crimes against them,” Edwards and Cassell wrote.\n\nWhile Judge Marra could allow a jury to decide the complex case, prosecutors are asking him to toss\nthe women’s lawsuit and end the litigation.\n\n9/27/2017, 12:04 AM\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015029",
