  "text": "G10 currencies\n\nUBS View\n\nside have been considerably reduced.\n\n¢ The GBP trended higher despite stimulus measures by the Bank of England. The main reason is the need\nfor diversification out of the EUR and USD and decisive UK policy making. We maintain an overweight\nafter the strong rebound of economic data in 3Q 2012 which we expect to persist into 2013.\n\n¢ The CAD remains supported by better growth dynamics. However in the short term, around the US\nelections and fiscal cliff debate, a setback cannot be ruled out. We also remain underweight in the AUD.\n\n¢ The SNB has shown that it can defend the CHF floor. With EUR tail risk reduced the CHF likely recovers\ntogether with the EUR against most other currencies. Thus we close the CHF underweight.\n\ne We expect stronger policy intervention in Japan to weaken the JPY over the coming months.\n\n4 Positive scenario\n\n& Negative scenario\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nChinese growth We expect China to land softly and then recover. Should China disappoint with a\nhard landing, then risk-unwinding would support USD and JPY vs. risk-taker\ncurrencies. In the base case, a Chinese recovery should support the AUD in the\nmedium term, but a dip below parity is likely in the short term.\n\nEuropean sovereign The main focus lies on the Spanish application for ESM/ECB support, which would\ncrisis, ECB policy be EUR positive; a rate cut (not expected) would hurt the EUR. Key date: Nov 8,\n\nECB meeting\n\nUS growth and Fed What will the Fed do once Operation Twist ends at year end? How will the\npolicy response presidential elections change political power in Washington? Key dates: Nov 6,\nUS presidential elections; Dec 12, FOMC meeting\n\n2 UBS\n\nSee table for current exchange rates and CIO forecasts\n¢ We believe the risks to the EURUSD currency pair are now more balanced, as tail risks on the European\n\nFX targets: EURUSD >1.35 / EURJPY 115\n¢ The announcement of unlimited QE in the US, as well as a stronger-than-expected acceleration of global\ngrowth or further European integration would be EURUSD positive. EURUSD should trade above 1.35 in\n\nthis case. Yen weakness should come as the Bank of Japan intervenes to weakens its currency.\nFX targets: EURUSD <1.25 / EURJPY 90\n¢ The European growth outlook deteriorates further with continued recession in 2013. The euro could\nrapidly fall below 1.25. A European debt-default cascade (possibly triggered by a disorderly Greece euro\nexit) is a tail risk for the single currency. Risk aversion would lead to an extended USD and JPY rally.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\n¢ We continue to have a preference for the\nGBP and keep the short in the JPY.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne We recommend that investors diversify\nfrom large USD and EUR exposures into\nminor currencies. Structural financing\nissues weigh on all the major currencies.\n\ne The best diversifiers based on long-term\nmacroeconomic fundamentals are the\nCAD and the SEK. The AUD, NOK and CHF\nshould only be added at better entry\nlevels. The GBP also remains attractive.\n\nUBS CIO FX forecasts\n\n24-10-12 3M 6M 12M PPP\nEURUSD 1.294 1.30 32 34 1.30\nUSDIPY 79,75 80 82 86 79\nUSDCAD 0.991 0.94 0,94 Q;92 0.98\nAUDUSD 0322 0.97 00 05 0.74\nGBPUSD 6018 {.85. 68 70 1.69\nNZDUSD 0.8138 0.78 0.80 0.83 0.60\nUSDCHF 0.9346 O88 0.92 O92 1.03\nEURCHF 2097 1.21 2) 23 1.33\nGBPCHF 4974 1.54 54 56 1.73\nEURJPY 03.27 104 108 115 102\nEURGBP 0.8079 0.79 Of 9) O79 O77\nEURSEK 8.6577 8.20 8.00 8.00 8.86\nEURNO! 7.4373 1:30 eA AG) 7.20 8.53\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters, UBS, as of 15 Octeber 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nF ‘ Tl 31\nFor further information please contact ClO asset class specialist Thomas Flury, thomas.flury@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025278",
