I asked him if he thought the average stu-\ndent attending the University of Illinois was going there because she\nfigured after graduation she would be able to get a job.\n\nHe agreed.\n\nI then asked whether job skills were in fact taught to the majority\nof students there and whether the faculty, by and large, actually had\never worked anyplace but a university.\n\nHe laughed.\n\nIt is OK that Yale hires only intellectuals and only the best of the\nbest because Yale is not a state-run institution and Yale can do what it\nwants. No one is making anyone go to Yale. Caveat emptor.\n\nBut a state spending a great deal of money on its flagship educa-\ntional institution ought to know what it is getting.\n\nThis is what it is getting—Yale.\n\nThere are no faculty members at the University of Illinois in any\nmainstream department (I don’t mean agriculture, for example) who\ndo not consider themselves the equal of, and in some cases better\nthan, their Yale colleagues.\n\nWhen I went to Northwestern, I was given the right to hire a va-\nriety of faculty in a number of disciplines that related to learning.\nWhen you recruit faculty, you mostly consider how your institution\nmight look better to someone at another institution. So, Northwestern\ndoesn’t recruit from Harvard or MIT (or Yale!) very often because Chi-\ncago doesn’t seem a more appealing place than Boston to an academic\nand Northwestern isn’t a step up. And, Northwestern doesn’t recruit\nfrom California in general, for the same reason.\n\nSo, it’s the University of [linois!\n\nI recruited heavily from [linois because Chicago looks more ap-\npealing than Champaign-Urbana to most people, so I had something\nto offer, and the faculty there had already bought into the idea of liv-\ning in the Midwest. Moreover, in the academic world, the University\nof Illinois is considered to a top-ranked institution with a faculty every\nbit as good as Yale’s, maybe better in some departments.\n\nSo, why is this bad?\n\nIt is bad for the students of the state of Illinois who worked hard\nto get into the state’s best university only to discover that its faculty\nthink they are at Yale.\n\nOf course, they know they are not at Yale, but they are compet-\ning in that world nevertheless.
