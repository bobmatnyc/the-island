The obituary evoked inquiries\n\nfrom newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV.\n\n“What's the meaning of it?” one editor asked me. “There's a lot of excitement at the city\n\ndesk.”\n“That is the meaning of it.”\n\nA few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived\nmagazine, Cheetah, published a fake obituary of me.
