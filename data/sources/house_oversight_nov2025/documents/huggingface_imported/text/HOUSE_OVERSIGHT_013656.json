  "text": "what appeared to be rageful biting and then immobilized resignation in behaviorally\ndepressed rats.\n\nFreud’s last paper, Analysis, Terminable and Interminable (1939), featured\nexamples of what he perceived to be the unsolvable mystery of helpless\npsychological entrapment in repetitious patterns of self-destructive behavior. He\nblamed the lliad’s and Odyssey’s villainous immortal, Thanatos, the ever-\nthreatening spirit of death and destruction to contrast with the good, life giving Eros.\nThe Yiddish word for a personified Thanatos is Moloch ha-Moves. A range of\nfixations in self-excitatory, repetitious, self-mutilating behaviors is documented in\ndomesticated animals. Dogs, particularly German Shepherds and Labrador\nRetrievers, can lock up in compulsive grooming cycles of what is called acral lick in\nwhich endless licking of paws or flanks lead to the break down of skin into seeping-\nsore dermatitis, which, in turn, stimulates more licking.\n\nMark Twain wrote a story about his getting stuck in ceaseless mental\nrepetitions of a catchy, clangy poem. He could not stop reciting it to himself even\nafter days of sleep loss and anorexia. He was finally cured by relating his problem\nand the poem to his pastor who he then unwittingly heard creating a community\nepidemic by including the rhyme in his following Sunday’s sermon. Psychologists,\nwho study this form of human mental limit cycle attacks, call this state of internal,\nrepetitiously recited, poetic stuckness, earworms.\n\nThere are additional invariants of sudden transformations into spiritual-mind-\nbrain bifurcations into a limit cycle lockups and, as discussed, one of them is\npsychological splitting. |n psychoanalytic theory, as first suggested by Freud in his\n1937 written and posthumously published paper, Splitting of the Ego in the Process\nof Defense (1940), splitting implies two simultaneous and contrary psychological\nreactions, one can be conscious and the other unconscious. They can both emerge\nin conflictual situations involving adaptive efforts of the personality to deal with the\nopposition between some form of powerful instinctual pressure and attendant\nperceived or imagined danger. Otto Fenichel’s Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis\n(1950) elucidates multiple manifestations of splitting of the | (more technically, the\n\nego) into a conscious part that knows reality versus an unconscious part that denies\n\n156\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013656",
