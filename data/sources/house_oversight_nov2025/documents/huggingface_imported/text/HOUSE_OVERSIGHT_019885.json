  "text": "After Trump’s victory, Ailes seemed to balance regret that he had not seized the chance\nto run his friend’s campaign with incredulity that Trump’s offer had turned out to be the\nultimate opportunity. Trump’s rise to power, Ailes understood, was the improbable\ntriumph of many things that Ailes and Fox News represented. After all, Ailes was perhaps\nthe person most responsible for unleashing the angry-man currents of Trump’s victory: he\nhad invented the right-wing media that delighted in the Trump character.\n\nAiles, who was a member of the close circle of friends and advisers Trump frequently\ncalled, found himself hoping he would get more time with the new president once he and\nBeth moved to Palm Beach; he knew Trump planned to make regular trips to Mar-a-Lago,\ndown the road from Ailes’s new home. Still, though Ailes was well aware that in politics,\nwinning changes everything—the winner is the winner—he couldn’t quite get his head\naround the improbable and bizarre fact that his friend Donald Trump was now president of\nthe United States.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nAt nine-thirty, three hours late, a good part of the dinner already eaten, Bannon finally\narrived. Wearing a disheveled blazer, his signature pairing of two shirts, and military\nfatigues, the unshaven, overweight sixty-three-year-old joined the other guests at the table\nand immediately took control of the conversation. Pushing a proffered glass of wine away\n\n“T don’t drink’—he dived into a live commentary, an urgent download of information\nabout the world he was about to take over.\n\n“We’re going to flood the zone so we have every cabinet member for the next seven\ndays through their confirmation hearings,” he said of the business-and-military 1950s-type\ncabinet choices. “Tillerson is two days, Session is two days, Mattis is two days... .”\n\nBannon veered from “Mad Dog” Mattis—the retired four-star general whom Trump\nhad nominated as secretary of defense—to a long riff on torture, the surprising liberalism\nof generals, and the stupidity of the civilian-military bureaucracy. Then it was on to the\nlooming appointment of Michael Flynn—a favorite Trump general who’d been the\nopening act at many Trump rallies—as the National Security Advisor.\n\n“He’s fine. He’s not Jim Mattis and he’s not John Kelly ... but he’s fine. He just needs\nthe right staff around him.” Still, Bannon averred: “When you take out all the never-\nTrump guys who signed all those letters and all the neocons who got us in all these wars\n... It’s not a deep bench.”\n\nBannon said he’d tried to push John Bolton, the famously hawkish diplomat, for the\njob as National Security Advisor. Bolton was an Ailes favorite, too.\n\n“He’s a bomb thrower,” said Ailes. “And a strange little fucker. But you need him.\nWho else is good on Israel? Flynn is a little nutty on Iran. Tillerson”—the secretary of\nstate designate—“just knows oil.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019885",
