  "text": "Attorney’s Office apparently disregarded or was not aware of in the proceedings before the lower\ncourt. Jd.\n\nNot only are the appellate briefs subject to the strong presumption of openness that\napplies to all judicial documents but there is also an intense public interest in disclosing these\nspecific documents because they will shed light on why the District Attorney’s Office initially\ntook the controversial decision to argue in favor of lenient treatment of Epstein.? As Justice\nBurger wrote, “[p]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but\nit is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.” Richmond\nNewspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 572 (1980). “Only a free and unrestrained press can\neffectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free\npress is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people... .” N.Y.\nTimes Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 717 (1971) (Black, J. concurring). In short, the\nappellate briefs should be unsealed so that the Post can inform the public about the decisions\ntaken by the District Attorney’s Office with respect to Epstein so that the public can decide\nwhether there was anything careless or improper about those decisions.\n\nThe need for transparency and public understanding of why the District Attorney’s Office\nhandled the Epstein case the way it did is heightened by the fact that District Attorney Vance has\n\nfaced criticism over claims that his office gives favorable treatment to rich and powerful men\n\n? The presumption of openness is grounded in the U.S. and New York Constitutions as well as deeply-entrenched\ncommon law rules that govern this Court. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I,\nsection 8 of the New York State Constitution both recognize the presumptive right of the public and press to access\nand inspect court records. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1 (1986); Globe Newspaper Co. v.\nSuperior Court, 457 U.S. 596 (1982); In re Associated Press v. Bell, 70 N.Y.2d 32, 517 N.Y.S.2d 444 (1987). In\naddition to being well established under the federal and state constitutions, the right of access to court records “‘is\nalso firmly grounded in common law principles.” Danco Labs., Ltd. v. Chem. Works of Gideon Richter, Ltd.,274\nA.D.2d 1, 6, 711 N.Y.S.2d 419, 423 (1st Dep’t 2000) (citing inter alia Nixon v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S.\n589, 597 (1978)). See also People v. Burton, 189 A.D.2d 532, 535-36, 597 N.Y.S.2d 488, 491-92 (3d Dep’t 1993)\n\n“a common-law presumption” favors public access to court records); /n re Application of National Broad. Co., 635\nF.2d 945, 949 (2d Cir. 1980) (“[T]he common law right to inspect and copy judicial records is beyond dispute.”)\n(citation omitted).\n\n13\n4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016500",
