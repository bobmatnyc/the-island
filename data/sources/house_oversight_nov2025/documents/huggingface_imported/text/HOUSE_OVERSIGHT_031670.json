Warner \nSelect Committee on Intelligence \nUnited States Senate \nWashington, D.C. 20510 \nRobert K. Kelner \nCovington & Burling LLP \nOne CityCenter \n850 Tenth Street, NW \nWashington, DC 20001-4956 \nMay 22, 2017 \nRe: Subpoena to Lieutenant General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) \nDear Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Warner: \nWe write in response to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's subpoena dated \nMay 10, 2017, requesting that our client, Lieutenant General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.), produce \nany documents he may have that are responsive to a broad range of requests covering an 18-\nmonth period of time. Specifically, the subpoena requests that he create a list of all meetings and \nall communications between himself and Russian officials, and that he produce records of all \ncommunications between himself and President Trump's campaign that were in any way related \nto Russia, for the period from June 16, 2015, to January 20, 2017. \nIn our May 8, 2017, letter to the Committee, we reiterated General Flynn's eagerness to \ngive a full account of the facts and to answer the Committee's questions, should the \ncircumstances permit, including assurances against unfair prosecution. We stated that, absent \nsuch assurances, General Flynn would respectfully decline your request for an interview and for \nthe production of documents. \nOur client's position remains unchanged. Producing documents that fall within the \nsubpoena's broad scope would be a testimonial act, insofar as it would confirm or deny the \nexistence of such documents. Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and \napplicable court precedents, no person is required to offer testimony when he has \"reasonable \ncause to apprehend danger from a direct answer,\" even when that person is entirely innocent \nand has committed no crime.1 Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has \"emphasized that \none of the Fifth Amendment's basic functions... is to protect innocent men . . . who otherwise \nmight be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\"2 The Court held that even \"truthful responses \nof an innocent witness\" may provide the Government with evidence that could be used against \nI See Ohio v. Reiner, 532 U.S. 17, 21 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n2 Id. (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nDC: 6427118-1 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031670 \nCOVINGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 2 \nthe witness. 3 And, as courts have repeatedly held, the protection offered by the Fifth \nAmendment privilege extends to producing documents where the act of production itself is \ntestimonial in nature. \nThe context in which the Committee has called for General Flynn's testimonial \nproduction of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any \ntestimony he provides could be used against him. Multiple Members of Congress have \ndemanded that he be investigated and even prosecuted. He is the target on nearly a daily basis of \noutrageous allegations, often attributed to anonymous sources in Congress or elsewhere in the \nUnited States Government, which, however fanciful on their face and unsubstantiated by \nevidence, feed the escalating public frenzy against him.4 Additionally, in the intervening time \nsince the Committee issued its subpoena, the Department of Justice has appointed a special \ncounsel to investigate these and related matters. This environment creates a \"reasonable cause \nto apprehend danger,\" giving rise to a constitutional right not to testify. A detailed explanation \nof the legal basis for respectfully declining to comply with the Committee's requests follows \nbelow.5 \nThe Fifth Amendment Privilege Bars Congress From Compelling A Witness to Provide \nTestimony Through The Act of Producing Documents  \nThe Fifth Amendment protects an individual from being \"compelled in any criminal case \nto be a witness against himself.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. This privilege applies in congressional \ninvestigations. In Watkins v. United States, Chief Justice Warren stressed that \"the \nconstitutional rights of witnesses will be respected by the Congress as they are in a court of \njustice.... Witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves.\" 354 U.S. 178, \n187-88 (1957). The Supreme Court later held in United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27,34 \n(200o), that the right not to be compelled to give testimony against oneself applies as well to the \ncompelled production of documents that would be \"testimonial\" in nature. Specifically, the act \nof producing documents in response to a subpoena may have a \"compelled testimonial aspect\" \nwhen \"the act of production itself may implicitly communicate statements of fact\" that the \ndocuments \"existed, were in his possession or control, and were authentic.\" Id. at 36 (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605,613 & n.11 (1984)). \n3 Id. \n4 These include leaks that purport to describe classified briefings, documents, and intelligence \ncollection. Any actual leaks of classified information -- including reported leaks of signals \nintelligence -- constitute criminal offenses by government officials violating their duty to protect \nclassified information. \n5 General Flynn reserves the right to assert, in connection with the subpoena, any other privilege \nor protection provided by the Constitution, statute, or common law. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031671 \nCOVINGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 3 \nA. If the government fails to demonstrate prior knowledge of requested \nsubpoenaed documents, the act of producing those documents is testimonial. \nTwo Supreme Court precedents, Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976) and United \nStates v. Hubbell, as well as Hubbell's progeny, United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313 (D.C. Cir. \n2oo6), inform the determination of whether a production of documents in response to a \nsubpoena has a testimonial character. Fisher involved IRS investigations in which the \ngovernment learned that the investigated taxpayers had given their attorneys tax returns \nprepared by their accountants in the years in question. The Court highlighted that the \nsubpoenaed documents belonged to the accountant and not the target of the investigation, were \nprepared by the accountant, and are \"the kind usually prepared by an accountant working on the \ntax returns of his client.\" Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411. The Court concluded that insofar as the \ngovernment was not relying on the taxpayer to prove the existence of the documents, production \nof the documents was not \"testimonial\" because \"the existence and location of the papers are a \nforegone conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's \ninformation by conceding that he in fact has the papers.\" Id. \nIn contrast to Fisher, a case in which investigators already knew that documents existed \nand exactly where they were located, the investigators in Hubbell lacked \"any prior knowledge of \neither the existence or the whereabouts\" of the subpoenaed materials. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 44-\n45. Hubbell arose out of the Whitewater investigation, in which Independent Counsel Kenneth \nStarr sought broad categories of information from Webster Hubbell, a target of the \ninvestigation. The subpoena included such requests as \"any and all documents reflecting, \nreferring, or relating to\" the broad contours of the investigation, as well as \"Hubbell's schedule \nof activities.\" Id. at 41, 47. In examining the broad requests in the subpoena, the Court \nemphasized that \"it [was] apparent from the text of the subpoena itself that the prosecutor \nneeded respondent's assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce \nthose sources.\" Id. at 41. The Court ruled that the acts required to respond to such a broad \nsubpoena were testimonial in nature, comparing them to \"answering a series of interrogatories \nasking a witness to disclose the existence and location of particular documents fitting certain \nbroad descriptions.\" Id. at 41, 43. \nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit applied Hubbell and \nFisher in United States v. Ponds, framing the inquiry as concerning \"an act of production that, \nin its testimonial character, falls somewhere between the response to a fishing expedition \naddressed in United States v. Hubbell, and the production of documents whose existence was a \n'foregone conclusion' in Fisher v. United States.\" United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313, 316 \n(D.C. Cir. 2oo6). The court emphasized that \"[w]hether an act of production is sufficiently \ntestimonial to implicate the Fifth Amendment ... depends on the government's knowledge \nregarding the documents before they are produced.\" Id. at 320. Significantly, the Ponds court \nput the burden on the government to show that the act of production would not be testimonial, \nrequiring the government to show its pre-subpoena knowledge of the \"existence, possession, and \nauthenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity such that the \ncommunication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.\" Id. \nat 324 (internal citations omitted). \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031672 \nCOVI NGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 4 \nThe court contrasted the concept of \"reasonable particularity\" with mere general \nknowledge of an event or topic, finding that mere \"prior knowledge [of a topic] ... cannot suffice \nto establish [the government's] prior knowledge of the existence and location of the documents \nrelating or referring to those topics.\" Id. at 326. Ultimately, the court held that \"[b]ecause the \ngovernment has failed to show with reasonable particularity that it knew of the existence and \nlocation of most of the subpoenaed documents... Ponds' act of production was sufficiently \ntestimonial to implicate his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the \nConstitution.\" Id. at 316. \nB. Because the Committee's subpoena fails to demonstrate with reasonable \nparticularity prior knowledge of the requested documents, General Flynn's act \nof production would be testimonial in nature. \nThe great breadth of the Committee's subpoena to General Flynn suggests that his act of \nproducing the requested documents, if they even exist, would be testimonial in nature, given \nthat the Committee has not demonstrated knowledge of the \"existence, possession, and \nauthenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity such that the \ncommunication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.\" Id. \nat 324. Schedule A of the subpoena requests production of: \n1. A list of all meetings between you and any Russian official or \nrepresentative of Russian business interests which took place \nbetween June 16, 2015, and 12pm on January 20, 2017. For each \nmeeting listed, please include the date, location, all individuals \npresent, and complete copies of any notes taken by you or on your \nbehalf. \n2. All communications records, including electronic \ncommunications records such as e-mail or text messages, written \ncorrespondence, and phone records, of communications that took \nplace between June 16, 2015, and 12pm on January zo 2017, to \nwhich you and any Russian official or representative of Russian \nbusiness interests was a party. \n3. All communications records, including electronic \ncommunications records such as e-mail or text message, written \ncorrespondence, and phone records, of communications related in \nany way to Russia, conducted between you and members and \nadvisors of the Trump campaign prior to izpm on January 20, \n2017. \nIn sum, the subpoena demands a list of \"all meetings\" with \"any Russian official,\" \"all \ncommunication records\" with \"any Russian official,\" and \"all communication records ... related \nin any way to Russia\" conducted with unnamed \"members and advisors of the Trump \ncampaign,\" that occurred over an 18-month period. The broad sweep and lack of specificity of \nthese demands clearly reflect that the Committee does not have specific knowledge regarding \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031673 \nCOVI NGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 5 \nthe existence of any particular responsive documents. See United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, \n613 n.12 (1984) (\"The most plausible inference to be drawn from the broad-sweeping subpoenas \nis that the Government [is] unable to prove that the subpoenaed documents exist . ...\"). \nThe first demand for a list of all meetings with any Russian official (or \"representative of \nRussian business interests\") over 18 months fails for want of specifying particular individuals, \nlocations, or dates. Moreover, this is not merely a demand to produce existing documents. It is \nactually an interrogatory demanding that General Flynn create a new document containing \ninformation that the Committee seeks to discover. This is a demand for direct testimony, not \nmerely a testimonial act of production. As in Hubbell, General Flynn's compilation of such a list \nwould be akin to him \"answering a series of interrogatories asking [him] to disclose the \nexistence and location of [meetings] fitting certain broad descriptions.\" Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 41. \nThe Court in Hubbell held that the witness could not be compelled to prepare such a list without \nviolating his Fifth Amendment privilege. Finally, the nebulous term \"representative of Russian \nbusiness interests\" necessarily would require General Flynn, in responding to the request, to \ntestify as to who is or is not a \"representative of Russian business interests.\" This too constitutes \ndirect testimony that is clearly covered by the Fifth Amendment privilege. \nThe subpoena's second and third demands are even broader in scope than the first, given \ntheir request for all communication records with any Russian official. The complete lack of \nspecificity in the request makes clear that, unlike in Fisher, the existence of any document \nresponsive to the Committee's request is far from a \"foregone conclusion.\" Fisher, 425 U.S. at \n411. The fact that the subpoena also demands all documents in the custody, control or \npossession of General Flynn's \"agents, employees, or representatives\" underscores that the \nCommittee does not know whether responsive documents exist, who may possess them, or \nwhere they are located. Were General Flynn to provide responsive documents, he would be \nproviding compelled testimony about \"the documents' existence, custody, and authenticity.\" \nHubbell, 530 U.S. at 28. This is precisely the sort of testimonial information that the Fifth \nAmendment privilege is designed to protect from compelled disclosure. See In re Grand Jury \nSubpoena, Dated Apr. 18, 200,3,383 F.3d 905, 911 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding an act of production \nto be testimonial in nature where a \"subpoena seeks all documents within a category but fails to \ndescribe those documents with any specificity. .\"). \nThe Committee must demonstrate more than general knowledge that a meeting may \nhave occurred; the Committee must demonstrate \"knowledge of the existence and possession of \nthe actual documents\" in order to prove that the existence and location of the documents is a \n\"foregone conclusion.\" Id. at 910 (emphasis added). The Committee simply has not met its \nburden of showing its \"pre-subpoena knowledge of the existence, possession, and authenticity of \nthe subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity.\" Ponds, 454 F.3d at 324. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031674 \nCOVINGTON \nThe Honorable Richard Burr \nThe Honorable Mark R. Warner \nMay 22, 2017 \nPage 6 \nInstead, as in Hubbell, the Committee's broad demands makes it \"apparent from the text \nof the subpoena itself' that the Committee needs General Flynn's \"assistance both to identify \npotential sources of information and to produce those sources.\" Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 41. As a \nconsequence, the subpoena seeks to compel General Flynn to offer testimony through the act of \nproducing documents that may or may not exist. In these circumstances, General Flynn is \nentitled to, and does, invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against production of documents. \nRespectfully submitted, \nRobert K. Kelner \nStephen P.
