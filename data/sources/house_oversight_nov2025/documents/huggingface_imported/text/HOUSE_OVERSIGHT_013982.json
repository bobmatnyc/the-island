Perhaps I was better off when I was following orders and ignorant of the\npossibilities. It was easier at least.\n\nAm I really successful or just kidding myself?\n\n5. Have I lowered my standards to make myself a winner? Are my friends, who are now making\ntwice as much as three years ago, really on the right track?\n\n6. Why amI not happy’? I can do anything and I’m still not happy. Do I even deserve it?\n\nMost of this can be overcome as soon as we recognize it for what it is: outdated comparisons using the\nmore-is-better and money-as-success mind-sets that got us into trouble to begin with. Even so, there is a\nmore profound observation to be made.\n\nThese doubts invade the mind when nothing else fills it. Think of a time when you felt 100% alive and\nundistracted—in the zone. Chances are that it was when you were completely focused in the moment on\nsomething external: someone or something else. Sports and sex are two great examples. Lacking an\nexternal focus, the mind turns inward on itself and creates problems to solve, even if the problems are\nundefined or unimportant. If you find a focus, an ambitious goal that seems impossible and forces you to\n\ngrow,®! these doubts disappear.\n\nIn the process of searching for a new focus, it is almost inevitable that the “big” questions will creep\nin. There is pressure from pseudo-philosophers everywhere to cast aside the impertinent and answer the\neternal. Two popular examples are “What is the meaning of life?” and “What is the point of it all?”\n\nThere are many more, ranging from the introspective to the ontological, but I have one answer for\nalmost all of them—I don’t answer them at all.\n\nI’m no nihilist. In fact, ?ve spent more than a decade investigating the mind and concept of meaning,\na quest that has taken me from the neuroscience laboratories of top universities to the halls of religious\ninstitutions worldwide. The conclusion after it all is surprising.\n\nI am 100% convinced that most big questions we feel compelled to face—handed down through\ncenturies of overthinking and mistranslation—use terms so undefined as to make attempting to answer\nthem a complete waste of time.®2 This isn’t depressing. It’s liberating.\n\nConsider the question of questions: What is the meaning of life?\n\nIf pressed, I have but one response: It is the characteristic state or condition of a living organism. “But\nthat’s just a definition,” the questioner will retort, “that’s not what I mean at all.” What do you mean,\nthen? Until the question is clear—each term in it defined—there is no point in answering it. The\n“meaning” of “life” question is unanswerable without further elaboration.\n\nBefore spending time on a stress-inducing question, big or otherwise, ensure that the answer is “yes”\nto the following two questions:\n\n1. Have I decided on a single meaning for each term in this question?\n\n2. Can an answer to this question be acted upon to improve things’?\n\n“What is the meaning of life?” fails the first and thus the second. Questions about things beyond your\nsphere of influence like “What if the train is late tomorrow’?” fail the second and should thus be ignored.\nThese are not worthwhile questions. If you can’t define it or act upon it, forget it. If you take just this\npoint from this book, it will put you in the top 1% of performers in the world and keep most\nphilosophical distress out of your life.\n\nSharpening your logical and practical mental toolbox is not being an atheist or unspiritual. It’s not\nbeing crass and it’s not being superficial. It’s being smart and putting your effort where it can make the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013982",
