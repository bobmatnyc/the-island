  "text": "Susan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children,\nschools, country houses and vacations.\n\nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live\nmusic. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza,\nwatches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old\nfather, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his\nhero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes.\n\nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is\nclose to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner\nfor artists uptown.\n\nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of\nthe shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman,\nWilliam advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot\ncontinues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom\nwith one-line greetings.\n\nAt last, “It’s a wrap” is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of\nelectrifying glamour,\" and “the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.”\n\nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting\n\nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet\nfrom Teterboro with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in\nSeptember, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they\ncould observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment.\n\nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial\n\ncomeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV.\nThe camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite\nsuit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about\nthe money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" like his famous\n\ndo. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.”\n\nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across\nthe street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews.\nMichael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan\nsplendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver\nStone’s surprise endings.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and it's got hit written\nall over it.\n\nDe ee ee eee ee i ee ee ee i ee a\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021239",
