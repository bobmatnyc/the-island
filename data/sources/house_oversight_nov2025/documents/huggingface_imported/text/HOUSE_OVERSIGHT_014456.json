  "text": "Options Risk Statement\n\nPotential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk\n\nUnlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by\ndefinition governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with\ngeneral options trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment\nrisk... all of which can occur in a short period.\n\nInvestor suitability\n\nThe use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are\nconsidered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are\nencouraged to become familiar with the \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized\nOptions\" (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult\nwith a FINRA Registered Options Principal.\n\nFor detailed information regarding the risks involved with investing in listed options:\nhttp://Awww.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp\n\nAnalyst Certification\n\nWe, James Barty, Abhinandan Deb, Barnaby Martin, Benjamin Bowler, Claudio Piron,\nDavid Hauner, CFA, Hans Mikkelsen, lan Gordon, loannis Angelakis, Kamal Sharma, Mark\nCapleton, Ritesh Samadhiya, CFA, Shusuke Yamada, CFA and Shyam S.Rajan, hereby\ncertify that the views each of us has expressed in this research report accurately reflect\neach of our respective personal views about the subject securities and issuers.
