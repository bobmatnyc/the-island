  "text": "From: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>\n\nSent: Tuesday, January 20, 2015 12:14 AM\nTo:\n\nSubject: your statement?\n\nImportance: High\n\nI have to hand it iii I'm sure she deserves the pretty penny she has made for her effort . She has\ncertainly caught the imagination of a public hungry for salacious fiction. To suggest her story is anything other\nthan that, a fiction , is ludicrous. Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( clinton was never ever there, easy\nto confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small even for one adult ). sex slave being paid\nthousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ). being\nlent out to a prime minister though this prime mininster, never out of sight of his massive security detail also\nnever visited the island, , sex ona small airplane with a famous lawyer while the other passengers must have\nbeen all looking out the window during the event . I would have thought that her fabrications were readilly\napparent , but now , being asked to deny what the press has termed her \" allegations \" is frankly silly. ok, to\nplay along I deny each and every allegation. The only person she didn't suggest she was forced to have sex\nwith , was Bilbo Baggins. , maybe its in the sequel.\n\n2\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
