  "text": "Defining Intelligence 157\n\nguess that she doesn’t think about causation because no one ever tried\nto get her to do so. So she may very well be smart but she sounds\nstupid because she seems to be unaware of her own causal reasoning\nand is not very good at it. Being good at understanding causation\nand figuring what could possibly cause what and why is a hallmark of\nintelligence.\n\nIntelligence can be enhanced by practicing the cognitive processes\nthat are the basis of intelligent behavior and intelligent reasoning.\nOne of these hallmark processes is certainly causation.\n\nWe could make Miss South Carolina smarter by teaching her how\nto determine what causes what and asking her to figure things out and\nexplain them to others using a causation model that she could defend.\nOf course, it would have been better if this process started when she\nwas a small child.\n\nNow, with that in mind, let’s look at the Palin remark. Palin was\nasked about her readiness for the office of vice president, which isn’t\nmuch of an office really. What was really being asked was her readi-\nness for the presidency, which was not unreasonable to worry about\nconsidering John McCain’s age. She responded in a way that made\nclear that she has no understanding of causation either.\n\nIn the statements above, she asserted (implicitly) the following\nbeliefs about causation:\n\nAny mayor or city manager is ready to be president.\n\nAny governor is ready to be president.\n\nAny commissioner is ready to be president.\n\nAny regulator of gas and oil is ready to be president.\n\nIf you have a vision of energy independence, you are ready to be\npresident.\n\nNow, of course, one of these beliefs is, in fact, shared by the country\nsince we have chosen governors to be president. But the other beliefs\nare simply wrong. No one thinks that having a vision of energy in-\ndependence prepares you to be president or that being an oil and gas\nregulator prepares you to be president.\n\nSo, what does Palin misunderstand here? She doesn’t get the idea\nof preparedness as causation. Having a degree in accounting prepares\nyou to be an accountant, most would agree. We believe, as a society, in\ncertain rites of passage preparing you for the next step. Palin apparently\nhas never thought about this or why anyone would hold such beliefs.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023897",
