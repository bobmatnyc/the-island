  "text": "xvi Preface\n\nThis lack of understanding about what learning really is like, and\nwhat teaching must be like in order to be useful, has caused us to set\nup school in a way that really does not work very well. When students\ncomplain about school, when politicians say school isn’t working, we\nunderstand that there is a problem. But we don’t understand what\nthe problem is. We think we can fix schools by making them more\nfriendly, or safer, or paying teachers better, or having students have\nmore say, or obsessing about test scores, but none of this is the case.\n\nThe problem with schools lies in our conception of the role of\nschool. We see school as a place to study academics, to become a\nscholar, when in fact very few students actually want to become schol-\nars or study academics.\n\nAS a society we have gotten caught up in a conception of school\nfrom the late 1800s that has failed to change in any significant way,\ndespite the fact that universal education has made the system un-\nstable. Universities dominate the discussion, and everyone listens to\nwhat academics have to say because they don’t see the alternative or\nknow whom else to listen to. But, if we understand how learning ac-\ntually works, and how teaching actually should work, the alternative\nbecomes much clearer.\n\nIt is establishing that clarity that is my goal in this book.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023746",
