  "text": "asset globally where vols are up this year — and the one with broader consequences for neighbors (through EM Asian intervention\npolicy). Hence, this week's focus in our FX Markets Weekly on two other dimensions of the bearish yen view: what is the currency\nworth if the BoJ successfully delivers 2% inflation, and how broad is the yen short.\n\n° To those who believe in purchasing power parity (and we are not amongst them), USD/JPY could move to 100 on a credible\nBoJ. Realizing these extreme targets requires Japanese participation in this yen move, since international investors could reach their\nrisk limits on yen shorts. So far domestics look fairly unconvinced. Japan has been posting net capital outflows (foreign purchases of\nJGBs minus Japanese purchases of foreign bonds) since mid-2011, but the pace of those outflows has not increased since then-\ncandidate Shinzo Abe began calling for much looser monetary policy. Stay short yen on the possibility that locals join the move, but\nrotate exposure. Book gains on a KRW/JPY one-touch, a USD/JPY seagull and CHF/JPY cash. Stay long NOK/JPY and re-enter\nEUR/JPY (both in cash). Stay short USD vs a basket of AUD, RUB and KRW.\n\nCommodities\n\n° Commodities are up around 1% this week, with all sectors gaining ground. In Wednesday’s GMOS, we retained all our\nprevious positions. Our main trades are long Brent time spreads (long front vs. third futures contract), long industrial metals, long US\nnatural gas and short agriculture. Production losses in the North Sea should support our Brent trade, while the current economic\nrebound in China should push industrial metals higher. US Natural gas should benefit from the ongoing switch from coal to gas for\npower generation and 2013 should see the first slowdown in production since the boom began five years ago.\n\ne The GSCI agriculture index has already reversed around 80% of its rise in summer 2012 as farmers have planted a much\nlarger area, which means a higher likelihood of much higher future supply. We stay short for now as we think this downtrend has\nfurther to go. We are also long gasoil vs. Brent. Global inventories are very low and demand from Asia is picking up, consistent with\nthe economic data, which we expect to improve further over the coming months. An expected cold snap should also help push demand\nhigher through January\n\ne We took profit on our long position in gold last Friday and year-to-date gold is down around 1%. We believe many investors\nhad bought gold over the past few years to hedge against the risk of “QE unlimited.” The recent FOMC minutes, however, have since\nraised the risk of an early end to QE, reducing to need to hedge through gold. The risk is thus that a number of market participants will\nreduce their gold hedges, pushing gold prices down further. We still like gold as a hedge against long-term inflation risks once global\ngrowth returns to trend and we would look to reopen the position at around $1,550/oz..\n\nJan Loeys\n(1-212) 834-5874\n\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com\n\nJohn Normand\n(44-20) 7134-1816\njohn.normand@jpmorgan.com\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou\n(44-20) 7134-7815\n\nnikolaos.panigirtzoglou@jpmorgan.com\n\nSeamus Mac Gorain\n(44-20) 7134-7761\nseamus.macgorain@jpmorgan.com\n\nMatthew Lehmann\n(44-20) 7134-7813\nmatthew.m.lehmann@jpmorgan.com\n\nLeo Evans\n(44-20) 7742-2537\nleonard.a.evans@jpmorgan.com\n\nIf you no longer wish to receive these e-mails then click here to unsubscribe www.jpmorganmarkets.com\n\nAnalyst certification: I certify that: (1) all of the views expressed in this research accurately reflect my personal views about any and all of the subject\nsecurities or issuers; and (2) no part of my compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views\nexpressed herein.
