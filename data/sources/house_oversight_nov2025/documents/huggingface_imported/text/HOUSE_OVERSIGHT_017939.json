  "text": "Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 5 of 28\n\nexposing how Epstein and his lawyers had corrupted the legal system to obtain the NPA and\nreferring to Dershowitz’s sexual abuse of Roberts. Dershowitz’s response on behalf of himself\nand his client and co-conspirator Epstein has been a desperate barrage of false and increasingly\ndefamatory attacks on Roberts. The purpose and effect of these attacks has been to damage\nRobert’s reputation and credibility and to try to intimidate her into silence.\n\n14. Defendant’s central assertion is that Roberts has committed perjury, and that in\nDecember 2014, Roberts and her attorneys hatched a scheme to falsely accuse Dershowitz of sex\ntrafficking as part of a criminal attempt to extort a settlement from another party.\n\n15. As Defendant and Epstein well knew, Dershowitz’s assertion was false.\nDershowitz and Epstein knew that Dershowitz had in fact had sex with Plaintiff. Dershowitz and\nEpstein also knew that Roberts’s assertions about Dershowitz were not part of any criminal\nextortion plot. Indeed, Dershowitz and Epstein knew that Roberts had identified Dershowitz as a\nsexual predator years before December 2014.\n\n16. Defendant’s knowledge of the falsity of his attacks on Roberts have not, however,\nlimited the scope or scale of those attacks.\n\n17. | Examples of Dershowitz’s knowingly false and malicious defamatory statements\nmade on behalf of himself and Epstein are:\n\n(a) November 28, 2018: “the story was 100% flatly categorically made up” and\n“Roberts and her attorneys fabricated the assertion in order to get money from other\npowerful, wealthy people”. (Exhibit 1, p. 8).\n\n(b) December 1, 2018: “I never met Roberts; I never had sex with her; she\n\nsimply made up the entire story for money”. (Exhibit 2).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017939",
