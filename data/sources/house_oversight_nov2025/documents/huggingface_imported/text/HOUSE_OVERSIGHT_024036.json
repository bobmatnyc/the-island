As the populations of\nthese countries become more affluent, a greater proportion of their GDP is being spent on health\ncare, and this is leading to rapid growth in many different healthcare product sectors in these\ncountries. For example, China’s prescription drug market, which is projected to be the world’s\nsecond largest by 2020, is projected to grow to more than $110 billion by 2015 - up from $50\nbillion in 2010.25 The medical device market in China is showing a similar growth pattern, with\nthe current $17 billion medtech market (world’s fourth largest) projected to more than double\nwithin the next five years. This growth in emerging economies is expected to continue for the\nforeseeable future, and as it does, it will open vast new markets for established healthcare\nproducts companies in more developed countries, and will become increasingly important as a\npercentage of sales of global brands. At the same time, it will create opportunities for smaller,\nU.S. based companies to partner with large multinationals and domestic companies in the\nBRICs that have established distribution channels in these markets.\n\nSIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY HEALTHCARE REFORM &\nRESTRUCTURING\n\nAs a result of the strong growth in healthcare expenditures, for at least the next decade, and\nlikely much longer, the healthcare industry in the U.S. will be going through a period of\nsignificant reform and restructuring as the increasing healthcare costs place unsustainable fiscal\nburdens on government programs. After years of dire predictions and endless debate amongst\nelected officials, pundits, corporate leaders, and patient advocacy groups, there is recognition\nthat long term healthcare liabilities are a critical issue and require broad reform to control their\ngrowth before they lead to irreparable fiscal harm. While much of the attention in these\ninitiatives is focused on identifying opportunities to cut costs, the silver lining in them for\ninvestors is that their objectives also seek to improve the quality of healthcare and to\nsubstantially broaden the population that has access to healthcare services covered by third\nparty payment.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Government has laid the foundations for restructuring the healthcare\nsystem through two key pieces of legislation. First, the HITECH Act provides large government\nsubsidies for the adoption of IT tools by healthcare providers. The Federal Government has\nrecognized that a fundamental underpinning of healthcare reform is a massive upgrade of the\ninformation technology infrastructure at all levels of the industry, and through this legislation\nhas earmarked $26 billion dollars in direct subsidies to catalyze investment in this area.\n\nThe second key piece of legislation is the ACA, which is being implemented as a first step in the\noverhaul of the U.S. healthcare system. The ACA was signed into law in the U.S. in 2010 and\nbegins its implementation phase in 2014. It is a complex piece of legislation that is designed to\nreform and overhaul many aspects of the U.S. healthcare system. The goals of the ACA are to\nincrease the affordability and rate of health insurance coverage for all Americans, and to control\nthe runaway growth in costs of health care faced by government, employers, and individuals.\nThe ACA mandates a number of broad reaching mechanisms to achieve these goals, and\n\n2 Reuters\n26 InVivo (Elseveir), June 2013\n\n25 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024036",
