  "text": "te OK ok\n\nTowards My Personal Sex-Positive Feminist 101\n\nThere's an aphorism from the early 1900s literary critic Andre Maurois: \"The difficult\npart in an argument is not to defend one's opinion but to know it.\" Even though I identify\nas an activist and genuinely want to make a real impact on the world based on my\nbeliefs... I often think that much of my blogging has been more an attempt to figure out\nwhat I believe, than to tell people what I believe. And sometimes, I fall into the trap of\nwanting to be consistent more than I want to understand what I really believe -- or more\nthan I want to empathize with other people -- or more than I want to be correct. We all\ngotta watch out for that.\n\nBut I'm getting too philosophical here. (Who, me?) The point is, I am hesitant to write\nsomething with a title like \"Sex-Positive 101,\" because not only does it seem arrogant\n(who says Clarisse Thorn gets to define Sex-Positive 1017?) -- it also implies that my\nthoughts on sex-positivity have come to a coherent, standardized end. Which they\nhaven't! I'm still figuring things out, just like everyone else.\n\nHowever, lately I've been thinking that I really want to write about some basic ideas that\ninform my thoughts on sex-positive feminism. I acknowledge that I am incredibly\nprivileged (white, upper-middle-class, heteroflexible, cisgendered etc) and coming\nmostly from a particular community, the BDSM community; both of these factors inform\nand limit the principles that underpin my sex-positivity. I welcome ideas for Sex-Positive\nFeminism 101, links to relevant 101 resources, etc.\n\nte ok ok\n\nSome Central Sex-Positive Feminist Ideas, according to Clarisse Thorn\n\n1) Desire is complicated, and people are different. These ideas both seem basic and\nobvious to me as I write them, but I wanted to put them out there because I think they're\nuseful anchors for all the rest.\n\n2) Gender is not a binary, and gender cannot be determined by a person's outer\nappearance or behavior. Different people experience and display gender in a galaxy of\nways. No woman in the world is perfectly submissive, perfectly hourglass-shaped,\nperfectly kind, etc, although these are stereotypes commonly associated with women. No\nman in the world is perfectly dominant, perfectly confident, perfectly muscular, etc.\nWhile many people reduce the idea of a person's gender to whether they have a penis or a\nvagina, the existence of trans people and intersex people proves that this isn't a valid\napproach. Individual people have all kinds of qualities that are attributed to the \"other\"\ngender... and the concept of an \"other\" (or \"opposite\") gender is weird in itself, because\nwhy does one gender have to be the \"other,\" and what does that imply?\n\nAll this having been said, gender is frequently perceived as a binary, and many people fit\nthemselves into the possibly-arbitrary system of gender that currently exists. There are\nideas of \"men\" and \"women\" that are culturally understood, widely adopted, and socially\nenforced. Feminism has its roots in women resisting men's violent and social dominance,\nand in women resisting the cultural emphasis on stereotypical men's desires.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018480",
