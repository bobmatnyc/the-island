Ultimately, this would improve household affordability, reduce social\ntensions and indirectly tackling energy subsidies as it frees up potential household\nincome to spend on electricity and gasoline.\n\nLand tax could generate up to US$11bn/yr from the major urban cities\n\nWe estimate that the government could potentially collect up to US$11bn per annum of\ntax related to undeveloped land in the top 5 urban Saudi cities which accommodate\nmore than 50% of the Saudi population. While the law will not be effective until end-\n2016, we do not expect the tax proceeds to be significant early on.\n\nTable 20: Land tax proceeds estimates for the 5 major urban cities\nLand tax could generate up to US$11bn per annum in first phase\n\nAnnual Land tax proceeds\n\nCity Selected urban land area(sqm) White land value (SARbn) @ 2.5% (SARbn)\nRiyadh 1,300,000,000 494 12.4\nJeddah 1,686,000,000 481 12\nMecca 850,000,000 485 12.1\nMedina 293,000,000 88 2.2\nDammam 200,000,000 48 1.2\nTotal 4,329,000,000 1,595 39.9\n\nSource: SAMA, BofA Merrill Lynch estimates for white land and proceeds\n\nTable 21: NTP objectives and KPls affecting the real estate sector\n\nStrategic objective KPI ; , Regional _Int'l\nUnit Baseline 2020 target Biman bimark\nMinistry of Housing\nEnable citizens to obtain a house Real estate sector contribution to GDP % 5 10 13 20\nImprove performance of real estate Average time required to license new Day/ Permit 730 60 44 6\nsector residential new projects\nEnable citizens to obtain a house Housing unit cost multiples of gross\nae , 10 5 67 3\nindividual annual income\nEnabling citizens to obtain suitable Real estate financing to non-oil GDP % 3 45 16 5\n\nhousing financing\n\nSource: Saudi National Transformation Plan\n\nTable 22: NTP government costs related to the consumer and real estate sectors\n\nConsumer SAR (000)\nMinistry of Economy and Planning 3,293,255\nMinistry of Commerce and Industry 4,313,050\nMinistry of Environment, Water and Agriculture 13,942,405\nMinistry of Haj and Umrah 333,600\nMinistry of Labor and Social Development 7,931,710\nTotal 29,814,020\nReal Estate SAR (000)\nMinistry of Housing 59,166,666\n\nSource: Saudi National Transformation Plan\n\n66 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016176",
