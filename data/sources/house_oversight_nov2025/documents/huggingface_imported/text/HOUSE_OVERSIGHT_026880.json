  "text": "RLK: The GDP per capita has gone\nup more than 50 times in these 40\nyears. And so that's number one.\nBut number two is national\nrejuvenation, national pride. This is\nwhat the government and the Party\nhas brought to China in terms of its\nposition in the world. So it cannot\nback down and look weak in terms\nof these tariff attacks. But given\nthat, given that environment, the\nChinese response is very carefully\ncalibrated.\n\nRLK: China levying tariffs on $60\nbillion is not dollar for dollar, the\nway the first $50 billion was. But\nwhat it is, in fact, is in proportion —\nbecause $60 billion is roughly 40\npercent of the roughly $150 billion\nof the total US exports to China,\njust as $200 billion is roughly 40\npercent of the little over $500\nbillion of the total China exports to\nthe US.\n\nE WAR\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\n\nthor\n\nHO\n\nGetty images\n\nCNN TODAY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026880",
