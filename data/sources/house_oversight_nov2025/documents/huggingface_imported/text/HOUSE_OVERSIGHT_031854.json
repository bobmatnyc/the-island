  "text": "21\n\nhappy marriage of economic convenience in which one partner does\nall the saving and the other does all the spending.\n\nIn Kissinger’s own words, China’s rise could “make international\nrelations bipolar again,” ushering in a new cold (or possibly even hot)\nwar. Nationalist writers like Liu Mingfu, author of China Dream,\nurge China to switch from “peaceful development” to “military rise”\nand look forward to the “duel of the century” with the United States.\nThere are those in Washington, too—apparently including, for the\nmoment, the Obama administration—who would relish a more\nconfrontational relationship. Yet Kissinger remains hopeful that\ncooler heads will prevail in Beijing: thinkers like Zheng Bijian, who\nurges China to “transcend the traditional ways for great powers to\nemerge” and “not [to] follow the path of Germany leading up to\nWorld War I.” Rather than attempting to “organize Asia on the basis\nof containing China or creating a bloc of democratic states for an\nideological crusade,” the United States would do better, Kissinger\nsuggests, to work with China to build a new “Pacific Community.”\nFour decades ago, Richard Nixon grasped sooner than most the huge\npotential of China. “Well,” he mused, “you can just stop and think of\nwhat could happen if anybody with a decent system of government\ngot control of that mainland. Good God ... There’d be no power in\nthe world that could even—I mean, you put 800 million Chinese to\nwork under a decent system ... and they will be the leaders of the\nworld.” That prophecy is being fulfilled in our time. The fact that\nuntil now China’s rise has been a boon to the United States rather\nthan a bane owes much to the work of Henry Kissinger. With this\nbook he has given his successors an indispensable guide to\ncontinuing the Sino-American “coevolution” he began.\n\nFerguson is writing a biography of Henry Kissinger.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031854",
