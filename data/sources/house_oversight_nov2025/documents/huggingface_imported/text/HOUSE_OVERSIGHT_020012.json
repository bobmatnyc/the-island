  "text": "Freedom Caucus. (Ryan’s people believed that Bannon was secretly urging Meadows to\nhold out, though earlier in the week Bannon had harshly ordered the Freedom Caucus to\nvote for the bill—“a silly Bannon show,” according to Walsh.) At three-thirty, Ryan called\nthe president to say he was short fifteen to twenty votes and needed to pull the vote.\nBannon, backed by Mulvaney, who had become the White House’s Hill operative,\ncontinued to urge an immediate vote. A defeat here would be a major defeat for the\nRepublican leadership. That suited Bannon just fine: let them fail.\n\nBut the president backed down. Faced with this singular opportunity to make the\nRepublican leadership the issue, and to name them as the problem, Trump wobbled,\nprovoking in Bannon a not-so-silent rage. Ryan then leaked that it was the president who\nhad asked him to cancel the vote.\n\nOver the weekend, Bannon called a long list of reporters and told them—off the record,\nbut hardly—“T don’t see Ryan hanging around a long time.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nAfter the bill had been pulled that Friday, Katie Walsh, feeling both angry and disgusted,\ntold Kushner she wanted out. Outlining what she saw as the grim debacle of the Trump\nWhite House, she spoke with harsh candor about bitter rivalries joined to vast\nincompetence and an uncertain mission. Kushner, understanding that she needed to be\ndiscredited immediately, leaked that she had been leaking and hence had to be pushed out.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Walsh had dinner with Bannon in his Capitol Hill redoubt, the\nBreitbart Embassy, during which, to no avail, he implored her to stay. On Monday she\nsorted out the details with Priebus—she would leave to work part time for the RNC and\npart time for the Trump (c)(4), the outside campaign group. By Thursday she was gone.\n\nTen weeks into the new administration, the Trump White House had lost, after Michael\nFlynn, its second senior staff member—and the one whose job it was to actually get things\ndone.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020012",
