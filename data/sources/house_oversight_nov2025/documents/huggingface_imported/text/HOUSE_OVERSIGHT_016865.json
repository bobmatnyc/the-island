  "text": "I was introduced to Max Tegmark some years ago by his MIT colleague Alan Guth, the\nfather of the inflationary universe. A distinguished theoretical physicist and cosmologist\nhimself, Max’s principal concern nowadays is the looming existential risk posed by the\ncreation of an AGI (artificial general intelligence—that is, one that matches human\nintelligence). Four years ago, Max co-founded, with Jaan Tallinn and others, the Future\nof Life Institute (FL), which bills itself as “an outreach organization working to ensure\nthat tomorrow ’s most powerful technologies are beneficial for humanity.” While ona\nbook tour in London, he was in the midst of planning for FLI, and he admits being driven\nto tears in a tube station after a trip to the London Science Museum, with its exhibitions\nspanning the gamut of humanity’s technological achievements. Was all that impressive\nprogress in vain?\n\nFLI’s scientific advisory board includes Elon Musk, Frank Wilczek, George\nChurch, Stuart Russell, and the Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom, who dreamed up an\noft-quoted Gedankenexperiment that results in a world full of paper clips and nothing\nelse, produced by an (apparently) well-meaning AGI who was just following orders. The\nInstitute sponsors conferences (Puerto Rico 2015, Asilomar 2017) on AI safety issues and\nin 2018 instituted a grants competition focusing on research in aid of maximizing the\nsocietal benefits of AGI.\n\nWhile Max is sometimes listed—by the non-cognoscenti—on the side of the\nscaremongers, he believes, like Frank Wilczek, ina future that will immensely benefit\njrom AGI if in the attempt to create it, we can keep the human species from being\nsidelined.\n\n62\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016865",
