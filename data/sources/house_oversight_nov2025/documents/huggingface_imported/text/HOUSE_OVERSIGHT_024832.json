As a commodity, we see economics diminishing as CBD supply rises with\nincreased acres along with higher costs for seed from increased seed demand. We also\nsee a lack of best practices for cultivation, storage restrictions and uncertainty about\nthe consistency of seeds/clones available increasing the probability that yields are\ncompromised.\n\n16 COWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024832",
