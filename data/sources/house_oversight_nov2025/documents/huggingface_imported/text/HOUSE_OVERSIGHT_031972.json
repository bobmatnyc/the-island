But Mr. Sessions, a long-\ntime conservative himself, disa-\nvowed that position in his speech \non Wednesday. \"Immigration law \nis the province of the federal gov-\nernment,\" he said. \nJustice Antonin Scalia, the con-\nservative jurist who died in 2016, \ntook a different view of the Ari-\nzona case. In an impassioned par-\ntial dissent, he wrote that \"it is \neasy to lose sight of the states' tra-\nditional role in regulating immi-\ngration — and to overlook their \nsovereign prerogative to do so.\" \nThere is no doubt that the Cali-\nfornia lawsuit is at odds with some \nof the Trump administration's \nusual positions. \"It's a fascinating \nsuit on a number of levels,\" Profes-\nsor Vladeck said, \"not the least of \naznalosous contexts, \nCristina nearigoes, a law pro-\nat 'Yale said she detected \npolitical parallels between the two \nsuits. \n\"Both administrations claim \nthat the state laws they challenge \nimpermissibly interfere with the \nexecutive branch's ability to en-\nforce the immigration laws,\" she \nsaid. \"But both lawsuits are also \nclearly designed to take on visible \nand politically powerful local offi-\ncials whose vision of immigration \npolicy conflicts with the presi-\ndent's and his supporters'.\" \nIn a news conference on \nWednesday, Xavier Becerra, the \nCalifornia attorney general, said \nhe was ready for the fight. The \nstate's laws, he said, were \"fully \nconstitutional and provide for the \nsafety and welfare of all our peo-\nple.\" \n\"California is in the business of \npublic safety,\" he said. \"We are not \nin the business of deportations?' \nThe Justice Department chal-\nlenged parts of three of Califor-\nnia's so-called sanctuary laws. \nOne restricts employers from co-\noperating with immigration offi-\ncials. A second generally prohibits \nstate officials from telling federal \nones when undocumented immi-\ngrants are to be released from \nNOAH BERGER/AGENGE FRANGE.PRESSE — GETTY IMAGES \nProtesting a speech delivered by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in Sacramento on Wednesday. \nThe state may not \npursue policies that \nundermine federal \nlaw,' a justice wrote. \nthe commandeering issue was a \nsubstantial one. \"To the ?xtenttlie-,_ \nTrump administration s claims \nagainst California would produce \nan outcome that would effectively \nforce states and localities to par-\nticipate m immigration enforce-\nment; she said,'. there couldhe an \nunconstitutional commandeer-\ning:\" \nProfessor Spiro said that Cali-\nfornia may have the upper hand in \nthe suit's early stages, as the is-\nsues in it are novel, leaving judges \nwith substantial discretion. \nThe Trump administration has \nnot fared well in federal courts in \nCalifornia in other cases concern-\ning immigration, including ones \nchallenging President Trump's ef-\nforts to restrict travel from pre-\ndominantly Muslim countries and \nto rescind a program protecting \nsome 700,000 young unauthorized \nimmigrants from deportation. \nBut the ultimate fate of the suit \nwill probably rest with the Su-\npreme Court. In 2012, with what \nmay have been unwarranted opti-\nmism Justice Kennedy said he \nhoped that conflicts over immi-\ngration policy would be worked \nout through reasoned discussion. \n\"The national government has \nsignificant power to regulate im-\nmigration,\" he wrote. \"The sound \nexercise of national power over \nimmigration depends on the na-\ntion's meeting its responsibility to \nbase its laws on a political will in-\nformed by searching, thoughtful, \nrational civic discourse?' \nstate custody. A third requires \nstate officials to inspect some fa-\ncilities that house people detained \non behalf of the federal govern-\nment. \nJennifer Chacon, a law profes-\nsor at the University of California, \nIrvine, said the state laws had \nbeen carefully written to avoid di-\nrect conflicts with federal immi-\ngration laws. \"I think it is clear \nthat California deliberately tried \nto draft laws that involved core ex-\nercises of state police power in a \nway that did not run afoul of fed-\neral law,\" she said. \nEach state law presents differ-\nent issues, and courts may give \nvarying answers depending on \nhow directly the state laws con-\nflict with federal ones. More gen-\nerally, though, courts will take ac-\ncount of the Supreme Court's deci-\nsion in the Arizona case, which \ncalled for collaboration rather \nthan conflict. \n\"Consultation between federal \nand state officials is an important \nfeature of the immigration sys-\ntem?' Justice Kennedy wrote in \nthe court's decision in the Arizona \ncase. \nGov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, \nhas said that consultation is fine \nbut that federal officials should \nnot use California's resources to \npursue undocumented Californi-\nans. The federal government, he \nadded, may do so on its own. \n\"They are free to use their own \nconsiderable resources to enforce \nfederal immigration law in Cali-\nfornia,\" he said in October in sign-\ning one of the challenged laws. \nThe Supreme Court has said \nthat the federal government may \nnot commandeer state resources \nto achieve federal objectives. In \nhis speech on Wednesday, Mr. Ses-\nsions denied that anything like \nthat was afoot. \n\"Contrary to what you might \nhear from the lawless open bor-\nders radicals,\" he said, \"we are not \nasking California, Oakland or any-\none else to enforce immigration \nlaws.\" \n\"We are simply asking Califor-\nnia and other sanctuary jurisdic-\ntions to stop actively obstructing \nfederal law enforcement,\" he add-\ned. \nBut Professor Rodriguez said \nInvestigating Sexual Misconduct Accusations, Arizona State Suspends a Physicist \nBy KENNETH CHANG \nArizona State University has \nsuspended Lawrence M. Krauss, \na prominent theoretical physicist, \nwhile the university investigates \naccusations of sexual misconduct \nover a decade. \n\"In an effort to avoid further \ndisruption to the normal course of \nbusiness as the university contin-\nues to gather facts about the alle-\ngations, Krauss has been placed \non paid leave and is prohibited \nfrom being on campus for the du-\nration of the review,\" the univer-\nsity said in a statement released \non Thesday. \nLast month, BuzzFeed reported \nthat several women have accused \nDr. Krauss of inappropriate be-\nhavior including groping women \nand making sexist jokes. \nThe university said it would not \nOrder home delivery today. \nrelease any additional details until \nits investigation is complete. \nDr. Krauss, a professor in the \nuniversity's School of Earth and \nSpace Exploration, is director of \nArizona State's Origins Project, a \nmultidisciplinary research effort \nto tackle questions about life, the \nuniverse and complex social prob-\nlems. He gained prominence for \nhis book, \"The Physics of Star \nTrek\" in 1995. He later became one \nof the leaders of the so-called \n\"skeptics\" movement that es-\npouses science over religion. He \nhas also written essays and Op-Ed \narticles that were published in \nThe Times. \nMichael Crow, president of Ari-\nzona State, told The State Press, \nan independent student news or-\nganization, that the university had \nreceived no complaints of har-\nassment against Dr. Krauss. The \nuniversity started the investiga-\ntion after being contacted by Buz-\nzFeed. \nDr. Krauss moved to Arizona \nState from Case Western Reserve \nUniversity in Ohio in 2008. \nLawrence M.
