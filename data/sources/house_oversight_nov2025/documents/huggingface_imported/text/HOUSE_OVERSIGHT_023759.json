  "text": "Cognitive Process-Based Education 13\n\nI want to teach kids to date and drive better. What kind of school is\nthat?\n\nBut this trivializes the point. I do want to teach students to date\nand drive better. But these are just a few instantiations of general cog-\nnitive processes. Forming human relationships and figuring out what\nis going in the physical world are two of many very important cogni-\ntive abilities that manifest themselves in myriad ways in real life.\n\nA properly designed school system needs to focus on cognitive\nabilities, not scholarly subjects. Kids will recognize instantly that these\nactivities are the ones they know how to do and that they need to get\nbetter at. If we allow them to choose what areas of knowledge they\nwould like to focus on while learning these skills, they would be atten-\ntive and interested students. No more ADHD. Poof!\n\nA society that organized schools around cognitive abilities would\nbecome one where people were used to thinking about what they did\nand how and why they did it. They would not find school stressful or\nboring.\n\nThis wouldn’t be a bad thing.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023759",
