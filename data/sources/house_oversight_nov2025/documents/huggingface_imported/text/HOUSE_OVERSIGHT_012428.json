And you\n\n18 well know that, Mr. Leopold.\n\n19 MR. LEOPOLD: She can't answer that\n\n20 question. The way you phrased that question,\n\n21 you're purposely making her not be honest in her\n22 testimony. She can't answer a question like that.\n23 She doesn't remember. So then you say, \"So you\n24 were lying.” That's improper and you know that.\n25 That's not a proper question. And any attorney\n\n39\n\n~\n\nthat would do that to a witnesses or to a person\n\n2 that's sitting in this chair is not acting\n3 professionally. You can't ask a question like\n4 that. You can do it, but it's not proper. And\n5 I'm sure you weren't trained that way, certainly\n6 not ethically.\n7 MR. TEIN: Will you stop?\n8 MR.
