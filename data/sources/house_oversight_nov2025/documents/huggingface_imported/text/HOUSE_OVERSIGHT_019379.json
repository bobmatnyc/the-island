She\n\nsaid another parent had overheard a\nconversation between their chil-\ndren.\n\nNow the mother was afraid her\nI4year-old daughter had been\n\n- molested by a man on the island.\n\nThe phone call triggered an\nextensive investigation, one that\n\n* would lead detectives to Epstein but\n\nleave them frustrated.\n\nPalm Beach police and the state\nattorney’s office have declined to\ndiscuss the case. But a Palm Beach\npolice report detailing the criminal\nprobe offers a window into what\ndetectives faced as they sought to\nclose in on Epstein.\n\nDetectives interviewed the girl,\nwho told them a friend had invited\nher to a rich man’s house to perform\na massage. She said the friend told\nher to say she was 18 if asked. At the\nhouse, she said she was paid $300\nafter stripping to her panties and\nmassaging the man while he mas-\nturbated. ‘\n\nPolice interview 5 alleged victims\n\nThe investigation began in full\nafter the girl identified Epstein in a\nphoto as the man who had paid her.\nPolice arranged for garbage trucks\nto set aside Epstein’s trash so police\ncould sift through it. They set up a\nvideo camera to record the comings\nand goings at his home. They mon-\nitored an airport hangar for signs of\nhis private jet’s arrivals and depar-\ntures.\n\nThey quickly learned that the\nwoman who took the 14-year-old girl\nto Epstein’s house was Haley Rob-\nson, a Palm Beach Community Col-\nlege student from Loxahatchee. Ina\nsworn statement at police head-\nquarters, Robson, then 18, admitted\nshe had taken at least six girls to visit\nEpstein, all between the ages of 14\nand 16, Epstein paid her for each\nvisit, she said.\n\nDuring the drive back to her\nhouse, Robson told detectives, “I’m\nlike a Heidi Fleiss.”\n\nPolice interviewed five alleged\nvictims and 17 witnesses. Their\nreport shows some of the girls said\nthey had been instructed to have sex\nwith another woman in front of\nEpstein, and one said she had direct\nintercourse with him.\n\nIn October, police searched the\nPaim Beach mansion. They discov-\nered photos ofnaked, young-looking\nfemales, just as several of the girls\nhad described in interviews. Hidden\ncameras were found in the garage\narea and inside a clock on Epstein’s\ndesk, alongside a girl’s high school\ntranscript.\n\nTwo of Epstein’s former\nemployees told investigators that\nyoung-looking girls showed up to\nperform massages two or three\ntimes a day when Epstein was in\ntown.\n\nThey said the girls were permit\nted many indulgences.

But as they tried to tighten the\nnoose, they encountered other\nforces at work.\n\nIn Orlando they interviewed a\npossible victim who told them noth-\ning inappropriate had happened\nbetween her and Epstein.
