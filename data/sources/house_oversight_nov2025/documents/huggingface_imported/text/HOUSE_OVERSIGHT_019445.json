The Biotron,\nHiiner says, is “as close as you\ncan get to nature [in a lab].”\nThe Biotron will help integrate\nbiology into the scientific study of\nglobal warming. Existing climate\nchange models, says Hiiner, are\ntore about physics than biology;\nmoreover, they describe changes\nthat are happening to the planet.\nrather than to particular habitats,\nspecies, or individuals. Scientists\nhaven't been able to create pre-\ndictive models, for example,\nof how changes in rainfall and\n\nresearchers tested in two sepa-\nrate “missions” whether humans\ncould live sustainably in a sealed,\nself-contained environment as\na precursor to colonizing outer\nspace. The Biotron, scientifically\nspeaking, is in a different league.\n\nThe superlaboratory is a\njoint project of the University of\nWestern Ontario, the University\nof Guelph, Ontario, and Agricul\nture and Agri-Food Canada, a\nfederal agency. The nondescript\nfive-story building, located in the\nagricultural heartland of south-\nwestern Ontario, is an engineer-\ning marvel, yel a bargain al just\nU.S. $28 million.\n\nInside are state-of-the-art fa-\ncilities that support research into\nmicroorganisms, insects, and\nplants, afl of which can be geneti-\ncally modified to suit research-\ners’ needs.

With more complete data,\nscientists will be able to make\nbetter predictions—and their ex\nperimental findings could better\ninform policy makers, who might,\nfor example, provide subsidies for\ncrops thatrespond well to emerg-\ning climate patterns.\n\nThe Biotron may call to mind\nBiosphere 2, the large artificial\nhabitat plopped down 20 years\nago in the Arizona desert, where\n\n14 onearth WINTER 2008\n\nBiotron’s climate chambers can\nbe varied from —40 degrees Fahr-\nenheit to 122 degrees, to simulate\nanything from the Arctic winter to\na tropical rainforest. On the reof of\nthe building are six “biomes”——air-\nlocked, preenhouselike structures\nthat have been custom designed\nto precisely control environmental\nfactors such as ternperature, UV\nradiation, light intensity, wind, pre-\ncipitation, and CO;, Each biome is\nlarge enough to house trees more\nthan 30 feet tall and to allow for\nthe re-creation of complex biologi-\ncal communities that can extend\nfrom the highest tree canopies to\nunderground soil layers.\n\nIf the possibilities seem end-\nless, they nearly are. The plan is\nfor the world’s leading scientists to\nrotate in and out of the lab space,\nand the biomes will be regularly\nreconfigured. One such setup will\n\nuse cross sections of Arctic perma-\nfrost, transported from northern\nCanada, so researchers can study\nhow it reacts to rising tempera-\ntures: As the permafrost thaws,\nhow much methane gas will be\nreleased? How will bacteria and\noverwintering insects be affected\nby changing freeze-thaw cycles?\nScientists will design and study\nmore temperate ecosystems,\nas well, to learn how changes\nin temperature and CQ» affect\nthe growth of photosynthetic\norganisms, including crops and\nboreal forest,\n\nBiotron researchers will also be\nable to study the benefits and risks\nof biotechnology in agriculture,\nforestry, and medicine by examin-\ning the basic biology of genetically\nmodified organisms: What is the\nrate of gene transfer from trans-\ngenic plants to wild ones? Can\nplants be engineered to manufac\nture medicinal compounds that\nwill benefit humans?\n\nThe Biotron will be equipped\nwith a sophisticated imaging and\nanalysis system—a virtual control\nroom—that will expand its reach\nglobally, allowing researchers\nanywhere to manage and moni-\ntar experiments remotely over\nthe Intemet in real time. A scien-\ntist in India studying the impact\not climate change on rice could\ninstruct the Biotron to raise the\ntemperature or CO, concentra-\ntion in a biome set up to simulate\na South Asian rice paddy. Then he\nor she could monitor the impact\nof this change through images\nand other data automatically col-\nlected and stored in a supercom-\nputing network.\n\nResearchers will vie for access\nto the Biotron in much the same\nway that physicists compete te\nuse the world’s few particle accel-\nerators or astronomers the latest\nand biggest optical telescopes.\nLike them, itis a place for frontier\nscience, where old models will fall\nand new and unexpected ones will\narise—excenpt that the goal is not\nto understand our cosmic origins\nbut to influence our destiny.\n\nafps uanoid uaeg JOU anDY JOY] ApIDp spoIiiuaya ZZ 01 pasodxa $1 piIYa uNdIIdawYy asddany ay] ‘sjonpoud aipa poUuOssad YSENOLY J,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019445\n\nFar From\nNirvana\n\nNEW YORK CITY'S AMITABHA\nBuddhists are full of good\nintentions.
