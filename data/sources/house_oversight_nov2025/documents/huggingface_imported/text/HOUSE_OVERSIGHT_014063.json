  "text": "84 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\n\nthe victim has an opportunity to be heard by the court, and by the\nGovernment, before the court accepts the plea.”!*\n\nBut OLC failed to recognize that its interpretation of the CVRA\nrendered the night to be heard a nullity in many important cases—including,\nnotably, the Epstein case.'* Where prosecutors and defense attorneys work\nout a nonprosecution agreement that agreement will never be presented to a\ncourt for review. Thus, in cases where the need for victim participation\nmay be the greatest—that is, in cases where the Government is considering\nnever filing any charges—OLC’s interpretation would bar victims from\nhaving any rights at all.\n\nEven in situations where a prosecutor works out a plea agreement,\nOLC’s interpretation is problematic. As OLC recognizes, prosecutors and\ndefense counsel commonly work out pre-indictment plea agreements\n(particularly in white-collar cases), under which a defendant will plead\nguilty to certain charges.'* Then, the parties jointly present to the district\ncourt a criminal “information” (that is, a recitation of the charges drafted by\nthe prosecutor but never presented to the grand jury'**) and a plea\nagreement, asking the court to file the criminal information and\nsimultaneously accept the guilty plea) As the OLC memorandum\nacknowledges, a crime victim would have the nght to object to the plea\nagreement, because the CVRA gives crime victims the “right to be\nreasonably heard” at any public proceedings involving a plea.'*” But under\nOLC’s interpretation of the CVRA, a crime victim has no nght to notice of\ncourt hearings until the charges are filed. Thus, if the information and plea\nare filed simultaneously, as is often the case, two scenarios are possible. A\nvictim could have no prior right to notice of the proceeding at which the\nplea was being accepted, or alternatively (if the act of filing the information\nin the course of accepting a plea triggers a notification right), the district\ncourt would be required to stop in the middle of proceedings and ensure that\nnotification was belatedly provided. Of course, these difficulties are all\navoided if the right to confer is properly construed as attaching before\ncharges are filed, such as during plea negotiations between prosecutors and\ndefense attorneys.\n\n#3 Id.\n\n“4 The OLC opinion was publicly released on May 20, 2011. Perhaps not\ncoincidentally, this release date was shortly before the Government filed its response in the\nEpstein case.\n\n45 See OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 9 (acknowledging the potential effect\nof the CVRA on plea negotiations).\n\n46 See FED. R. CRIM. P. 7(b).\n\n47 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (a4) (2012), OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6-7.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014063",
