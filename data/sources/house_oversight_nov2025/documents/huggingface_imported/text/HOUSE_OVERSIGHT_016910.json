  "text": "or are too “high frequency” (like static) rather than “low frequency” (more\ncontinuous, like actual real-world features).\n\nJust because AI systems sometimes end up in local minima, don’t conclude that this\nmakes them any less like life. Humans—indeed, probably all life-forms—are often stuck\nin local minima.\n\nTake our understanding of the game of Go, which was taught and learned and\noptimized by humans for thousands of years. It took Als less than three years to find out\nthat we’d been playing it wrong all along and that there were better, almost alien,\nsolutions to the game which we’d never considered—mostly because our brains don’t\nhave the processing power to consider so many moves ahead.\n\nEven in chess, which is ten times easier and was thought to be understood, brute-\nforce machines could beat us at our own strategies. Chess, too, turned out, when\nexplored by superior neural-network AI systems, to have weird but superior strategies\nwe'd never considered, like sacrificing queens early to gain an obscure long-term\nadvantage. It’s as if we had been playing 2D versions of games that actually existed in\nhigher dimensions.\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, it’s because physics has been wrestling with these\nsorts of topological problems for decades. The notion of space being many-dimensional,\nand math reducing to understanding the geometries and interactions of “membranes”\nbeyond the reach of our senses, is where Grand Unified Theorists go to die. But unlike\nmultidimensional theoretical physics, AI is something we can actually experiment with\nand measure.\n\nSo that’s what we’re going to do. The next few decades will be an explosive\nexploration of ways to think that 7 million years of evolution never found. We’re going\nto rock ourselves out of local minima and find deeper minima, maybe even global\nminima. And when we’re done, we may even have taught machines to seem as smart as\na mosquito, forever descending the cosmic gradients to an ultimate goal, whatever that\nmay be.\n\n107\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016910",
