When President Donald Trump assumed office in 2017 and actively began courting\nChinese President Xi Jinping, first at Mar-a-Lago and then at the Beijing summit, Congress\ntook a wait-and-see posture. But as his own ardor for a partnership with Xi cooled and his\nadministration became disenchanted with the idea of finding an easy new “engagement”\npolicy, momentum began to shift. Soon Congress was working toward one of the most\nsignificant reevaluations of American-China policy since the start of normalization fifty\nyears ago. And with the White House increasingly skeptical about the prospects of winning\nPresident Xi ‘s cooperation, a series of new initiatives began issuing forth from both the\nadministration and the Congress, suggesting a rapidly changing landscape for US-China\nrelations. What was telling was that this tidal shift now emanated not from Congress\nalone—where it had strong bipartisan support—but from the White House and National\nSecurity Council, the Pentagon, the Office of the US Trade Representative, the Department\nof the Treasury, and even the Department of State. As sentiment shifted away from hopes of\nfinding common ways to collaborate, a spate of new US policy initiatives began appearing\nthat suggested a sea change. Congress passed the 2019 National Defense Authorization\n\nAct, which sought to bolster US defenses against both Chinese military threats and\n\nChina’s influence-seeking operations inside the United States. Congress also passed the\nForeign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRMMA), which empowered\nCFIUS (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) to expand its oversight\nof foreign direct investment (FDI) from China. At the same time, members of Congress also\nbegan expressing ever more strenuous opposition to Chinese nonreciprocal practices in\ntrade and investment, such as: putting whole sectors of the Chinese economy out-of-bounds\nto American investors; using Chinese companies to buy into sensitive high-tech areas of\nthe US economy through mergers and acquisitions; and making the transfer of American\nadvanced technology to Chinese partners the price of American companies being given\naccess to Chinese markets. Congressional concern rose over Beijing’s continued expansion\ninto and militarization of the South China Sea; the predatory lending practices that can be\ninvolved in President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative; and Beijing’s continued\npersecution of Taiwan and opposition to US support for the island.\n\nThis section reviews highlights of Chinese government’s efforts to influence the US Congress\nsince the start of the normalization process in 1972.
