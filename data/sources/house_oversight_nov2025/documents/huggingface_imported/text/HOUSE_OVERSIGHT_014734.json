We are\ncognizant of the possibility that the willingness of Japanese investors — who have\nalready bought record amount of US bonds this year — to buy more is likely to be\nconstrained by their recent losses (Chart 7). However, with long-dated USD/JPY forward\noutrights near their lowest levels in more than a year, further purchases are more likely\nto be currency unhedged (Chart 8). This is why we would recommend buying USD/JPY\n\neven after the big rally of the past week.\n\nMore generally, the USD is likely to benefit from repatriation of overseas US corporate\nearnings, which is highly likely, in our view, given that it is the lowest hanging fruit in\n\nWashington for the new administration.\n\n4. MXN is oversold but BRL faces more headwinds\n\nUntil the US election, EM fixed income was the best performing asset class in 2016,\nbenefiting from the decline in rates in core markets as well as the rebound in global\ngrowth. The combination of higher US rates and higher USD over the past week has\nnearly wiped out its YTD gains. However, long positions remain crowded (Chart 9) and\nliquidity conditions are poor. For these reasons, we think downside risk remains and\nwould recommend selling a basket of Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian long bonds.\n\nSome EM markets have already seen brutal capitulation. In particular, MXN has priced in\nalot of bad news, even though it is not clear that the net impact of Trump policy is\nnegative for Mexico. In contrast, the BRL remains one of the most crowded EM\n\nChart 9: EM fixed income performance vs. positioning\n\na\n\n320) 575\n\n280 _\n160 475\nao\n\nJan-11. Jan-??
