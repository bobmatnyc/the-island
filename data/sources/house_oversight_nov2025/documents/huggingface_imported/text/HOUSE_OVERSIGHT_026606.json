  "text": "Obama's aides say he has not yet made up his mind on whom to nominate and won't announce a choice until\nafter the Nov. 4 elections, in part to avoid making the nominee into a political issue facing embattled\nDemocratic candidates. They say he also hasn't decided whether to seek confirmation in the Senate's lame duck\nsession later this year or to wait until the new year, when Republicans are expected to pick up seats if not win\noutright control.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Denis McDonough said in a statement, \"Kathy is someone who always tells it like it\nis, is a world class lawyer and remains a trusted adviser to the president. Anyone who knows Kathy knows she\nhas impeccable judgment, extraordinary foresight and is a formidable force. But she is also as selfless as they\ncome, and the president is proud to call her a close friend.”\n\nFollow Nedra Pickler on Twitter at https://twitter.com/nedrapickler\n\nThe information contained in this communication is intended for the use\nof the designated recipients named above.
