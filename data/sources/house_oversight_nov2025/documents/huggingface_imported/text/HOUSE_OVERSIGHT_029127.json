So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science\nand Rare Sentience).\n\nInitial ideas:\n\n* Expand the first episode “Mathematics and Truth” into two or likely three episodes. I’m intrigued by this\nbecause there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner’s\n‘unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)’, astrophysics, cosmology, biology,\ngeneral systems theory. I’ve felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three\nepisodes could work - if you agree, I’ll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts.\nAlso, Closer To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277\nepisodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029127",
