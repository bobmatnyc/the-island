  "text": "Zalikow: US posture in Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. We can put non-uniformed\npeople in Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdish conflict with NAM is about oil. These are big\nbets. NAM is saying you oil companies can go to Kurdistan or Basra but not both.\nImmediate neighbors of Kurds are Sunnis who also dislike NAM. What would US\nposition be if Iraqi forces fought with Kurds?\n\nMadeleine: Turkey needs to be a key relationship. Need to assure that Turkey is a\nsolid partner in our efforts in region.\n\nFeinstein: You guys underestimate activities and missions being executed by Qud\nForces and Republican Guards. Proxies are going to become major players.\n\nDov: If Syria goes Sunni, that’s bad for NAM.\n\nPodesta: What role of AQI in Syria?\n\nKahl: Risk to Iraq is growth of NAMs power, but we couldn’t affect politics in Iraq\nw 150k toorps what makes anyone think we could do it with 10 k troops. Also, we\ncouldn’t get SOFA cause all attys were saying we needed Parliament to approve\nSOFA and NAM said he couldn’t take it to Parliament.\n\nJS: Resid forces might have been helpful under some circumstances. Now, we\nneed to make clear that we do not support an Indep. Kurdistand. How do we do\nthat and still support Kurds?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025800",
