This is done through face-to-\nface meetings with government officials, providing testimony before congressional\ncommittees, track-two discussions, emails and other communications aimed at\ntargeted audiences, and a wide variety of publications.\n\nThe third role, undertaken by some, but not all, US policy think tanks, is to provide\nspecific research on a contractual basis for government agencies that is generally not\nfor public consumption.\n\nThe fourth role is to provide personnel to go into government service for fixed periods\nof time through the famous American “revolving door,” whereby think tanks become\n“governments in waiting” for ex- and would-be officials until just after an election,\nwhen there is usually a large-scale turnover of personnel in Washington as each new\nadministration is formed.\n\nIn American think tanks, selection of general research topics can be influenced by\noutside sources (management, external funding agencies, or government policy\nshifts). But the final selection is usually subject to mutual agreement, and the findings\nof research are not supposed to be dictated by outside pressures. At the same time,\nboth US think tanks and university research institutes are expected to maintain\nanalytical independence from their funders. If the funding body does seek to interfere\nwith a research project or promote its own agenda, there is an established expectation\nthat its funding should be rejected. More often than not, there is a process of\nmutual consultation between researcher, think tank, and potential external\n\nfunding bodies—through which interests are de-conflicted and grants are negotiated\nto the mutual satisfaction of all parties. While this is the optimal scenario, there have\nbeen cases revealed in the US media in recent years in which such principles were\nabridged.\n\nThe Role of China in American Think Tanks\n\nIt is against this general backdrop that the role of expanding Chinese influence on\nAmerican think tanks needs to be considered. What follows are the findings gleaned\nthrough interviews with seventeen think-tank analysts from eleven Washington- and\nNew York-based think tanks! that explore the nature of interactions that US think-tank\nspecialists have recently been having with Chinese counterparts.
