[Screams]\nOh oh oh oh oh OH OH OH OH OH OOQQOQOHHHHHH NOOOOOOO!!!\nLive in Hell!!!”\n\nThe majority of cannibalistic serial killers are motivated by a kind of\nnecrophilia--it’ s usually a highly sexually arousing experience for them\nwhen they eat their victims. Here, from my “Great Moments in\nNecrophilia” file, is a dispatch from Associated Press:\n\n“The prosecution in the insanity trial of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer\nrested its case. Dahmer has confessed to killing and dismembering 17\nyoung males since 1978. A jury must decide if he will be sent to prison or a\nmental institution.
