  "text": "/ BARAK / 12\n\nthat his long record of service should have earned him that right, and that it would\nbe painful for him to accept that, by June, there would be a new Labor leader.\n\nHe was relaxed and gracious when I arrived. We went through the details of\nwhat we’d agreed, and worked out what each of us would say to reporters. What\ncame next, as the party faithful filed in, was simple human nature, I suppose.\nSeeing some of his oldest supporters, he had second thoughts. His comments to\nreporters afterward were more hedged than what we’d discussed. Giora told me\nthat after all of us had left, Peres turned to him and said: “Look what Barak is\ndoing to me. What have you been doing?” Giora, who had been a conduit between\nus at the very beginning of our discussions, replied: “You asked me to bring Barak\nto you.” At which point, Shimon said: “OK. So probably I made a mistake.”\n\nAt a convention of 3,000 party activists in mid-May, a few weeks before the\nleadership election, he made a final attempt to mitigate that “mistake”. Nissim\nZvili, the secretary-general of the party and a longtime Peres ally, introduced a\nmotion to vote him into a new post of party president. A couple of Shimon’s\nfriends urged me to back the idea, describing it essentially as a ceremonial role.\nBut I feared it was a recipe for prolonging the agony. Whatever powers “President\nPeres” would have, the idea of two captains on a ship would almost certainly mean\ntrouble. I was especially reluctant to go along with it because our particular ship\nhad been in rough waters for so long. Labor needed to steer a calm, decisive course\ntoward the next election if we were going to defeat Bibi.\n\nWhat followed was one of the most painful spectacles I’ve ever witnessed.\nWhen Peres rose to make his case for becoming party president, he said: “I don’t\nwant powers. I don’t want honors. But I also don’t want insults. I announced my\ndecision to resign from the position of party chairman. Did someone push me into\nit? Am I trying to hold on to my job?”\n\n“Yes!” many hundreds of the delegates shouted back at him.\n\nStung, he reminded the meeting that it was he who had led Labor back from the\nbattering it took in the 1977 election against Begin. In 1981, he’d helped us\nrecover a dozen of our lost seats. Even so, because he hadn’t succeeded in forming\na Labor government, people had called him a loser! “Mah? Ani loser?” he asked,\nusing the English word. “Am I a /oser?”\n\n“Yes! Yes!” came the shouts.\n\n298\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028146",
