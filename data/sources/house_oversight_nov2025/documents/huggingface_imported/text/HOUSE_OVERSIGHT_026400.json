  "text": "Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch\nup), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor\ndevelopment! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-\nlevel structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it\nis easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place.\n\nIt could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a\nmore hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal\npatterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc.\n\nand CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time ,\nand structure of interactions. .\n\nI suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social\nand cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and\nlearn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts\nand mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they\nenjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in\nmath, because it does not help people or yield social attention.\n\nMen tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with\npeople, one will not have good social cognition.\n\nIQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I suspect\nhistorically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually independent\nand anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to find in Asia.\n\nAt the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to\nunderstanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in\na motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in\nmusic.\n\nIt would mean that Chomsky’s life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical\nlanguage, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational urge\nto build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a natural\nlanguage can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit.\n\nimy self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of\nthose layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based,. I belive that synphoic movments\nbest describe your layering. | they open with a basic simple melody, , after it is learned , it is repeated and \"\ndeveloped\" , inverted, distorted, related, etc. the development stage take a long time. then there is a\nrecapitlaltion of the whole. and its inter and intra actions. . african musci has lots of beats. and little\ndevelopment. - no accident, it mirrors their learning process.\n\nInteresting question if music is somehow indicative of genetically defined prefs, but I am not sure. It could be\npath effects, starting in culture.\n\nre taboo\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026400",
