Thanks Darren
Good news!

I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will
use mostly wires.

Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends | would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when | need to.

When | use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in
multiple currencies, but | am not familiar with DB.

Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed.

Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, | will also need to have
someone keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be
need for some work on my side before final filing is done.

On the other hand, if there is a "checks and balances" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent.

Please do let me know.

We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time)
