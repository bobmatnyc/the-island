  "text": "“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was\ncertainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments\nin his company and you know this to be true.\n\nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that\n“Andy”—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange\ntitle is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking\nabout far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out\nwith him.\n\nAnd Ghislaine?\nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.\n\nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours\ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious.\nShe has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of\nthe fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’.\nShe is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is\nclose friends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero,\n(Known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes\ndown to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.\n\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable.\nAnd then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement\nfor her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but\nthen Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d\nfraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange.\n\nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people\nin the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and\nmoved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to\nthe top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a\nnormal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.\n\nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her\nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at\nWaksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts\nof blemishes.\n\nDK OK KK OK KK KK OK KK OK OK OK KK OK KK OK OK OK OK OK KK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK KK 2K OK OK 2K OK 2K OK OK KOK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK KOK\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
