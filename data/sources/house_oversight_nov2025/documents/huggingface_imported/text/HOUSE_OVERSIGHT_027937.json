  "text": "was always the principle of targeted force, the idea that we would take out\ntargets, or defeat enemies, out of military necessity. But even on the first day of\nthe war, it was clear that it would be by far the most consequential conflict in\nour country’s history. There was no mission for Sayeret Matkal, nor, it seemed,\nany prospect of our playing any significant part.\n\nThe fact that my own role was slightly less peripheral was due to Avraham\nArnan. He phoned me almost as soon as we’d got news of the Israeli air victory,\nand told me he had been told to take a few men from the sayeret across the\nsouthern border. Our assignment was to complete our failed attempt to defuse\nthe booby-trap on the intercept in the Sinai. I quickly drafted in two others from\nthe unit. One was Danny Michaelson, a friend from Hebrew University, where\nwe had been lab partners. The other was Rafi Friedman, our paramedic, who\nhad been with me on several of our missions on the Golan.\n\nAvraham arrived at the base around noon. I got a Jeep and we set off. We\ncrossed into Egypt around four o’clock in the afternoon and headed for the field\nheadquarters of Israel Tal. Known as Talik, he was the commander of Israel’s\narmored corps, and Avraham knew him well. His wartime division consisted of\nthe country’s premier tank unit, the Seventh Armored Brigade, and a reserve\nbrigade. We accompanied them the next day to an abandoned Egyptian camp\nnot far from El Arish, in the northern Sinai. At least, we’d assumed it was\nabandoned. As Talik and Avraham were talking in his command post, we heard a\nsudden burst of gunfire, which seemed to come from just a few dozen yards\noutside. As everyone inside the command post looked around, Avraham turned\nto me and said: “Ehud, don’t you think we ought to deal with it?” Then, to\nTalik: “Make sure none of your guys shoots him.”\n\nI got Danny and Rafi. We made our way toward an underground bunker,\nwhich seemed the most likely source of the gunfire. Hugging the wall as I led\nthe way down a series of concrete steps, I clicked off the safety on my Uzi just\nin case. But with the main Egyptian forces in obvious retreat, I figured that\nwhoever was doing the shooting would have to be shellshocked, or insanely\nbrave, to put up a fight. There were eight men crouched inside, soldiers and\nseveral staff officers cradling Kalashnikovs, and an Egyptian army general. In\nwhat was obviously at least serviceable Arabic, I told them all to raise their\nhands. I made a brief attempt to interrogate the general, but quickly reached the\nlimits of my linguistic proficiency. So we marched them away and handed them\nover to Talik’s intelligence officers.\n\n89\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027937",
