Get an assistant—even if you don’t need one.\n\nDevelop the comfort of commanding and not being commanded. Begin with a one-time test project or\nsmall repetitive task (daily preferred). I advise using domestic help for language-intensive tasks and using\nforeign assistants in the early stages to improve the general clarity of your communication. Pick one\nfrom each group and get started.\n\nThe following sites, split up geographically, are useful resources.\n\nU.S. and Canada ($20/hour+)\nhttp://www.iavoa.com (International Association of Virtual Office Assistants). Global directory that\nincludes the U.S.\n\nhttp://www.cvac.ca (Canadian Virtual Assistant Connection)\n\nhttp://www.canadianva.net/files/va-locator.html (Canada)\nwww.onlinebusinessmanager.com\n\nNorth America and International ($4/hour+)\n\n39> 66\n\nwww.elance.com (Search “virtual assistants,” “personal assistants,” and “executive assistants.”) The\nclient feedback reviews on Elance enabled me to find my best VA to date, who costs $4/hour. Similar\nmarketplaces with positive reviews include www.guru.com and www.rentacoder.com.\n\nIndia\n\nwww.tryasksunday.com ($20-60 per month for 24/7 concierge, free one-week trial). AskSunday is one\nof the sophisticated new kids on the personal outsourcing block. Their site was nominated the #2 website\nof the year in 2007 by Time magazine. Just dial a 212 (NYC) area code and get routed to well-spoken\nassistants in India and the Philippines. I use this service 80% of the time, as most tasks take less than 10\nminues to complete. For longer projects, there are teams available for $12/hour.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013886",
