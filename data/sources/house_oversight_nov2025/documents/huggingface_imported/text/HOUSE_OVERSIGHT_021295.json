  "text": "Page |49\n\nFrom Relationships to People and\nGroups to Relationships with God\n\nThe extent and quality of our\nsocial connections can have profound\nconsequences for our physical well-\nbeing. In her essay, Louise Hawkley\nexplores in particular the consequences\nthat feelings of inadequate social\nconnection have on such physical\noutcomes as sleep quality, high blood\npressure, reduced ability to respond to\ninflammation, cognitive health in aging,\nand cardiovascular health. While\nHawkley emphasizes the relationship\nbetween the invisible forces of social\nconnection and health and the biological\nmechanisms responsible for this\nrelationship, Gary Berntson takes things\none step further by exploring a person’s\nperceived connection with God and its\neffects on our basic biological systems.\nMany of our basic biological processes,\nsuch as breathing or maintaining\nsufficient blood pressure to oxygenate\nthe brain, are reflexes that are so\nautomatic that they become invisible to\nus. Berntson shows that thoughts and\nbeliefs alter not only behaviors, but also\nthe regulation of these reflex-like\nmechanisms. And he suggests that the\nroot of these effects may lie in the way\nthat humans and other animals maintain\nbiological equilibrium with regulatory\nmechanisms that, under ordinary\ncircumstances, keep each other in check.\nThis theory describes a biological\nmechanism that could explain why\nSpirituality is associated with generally\nbetter health.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021295",
