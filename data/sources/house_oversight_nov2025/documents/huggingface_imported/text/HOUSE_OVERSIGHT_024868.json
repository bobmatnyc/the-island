In addition to CBD only-focused companies, we are starting\nto see crossover from adult-use / medical focused companies including Green Thumb\nIndustries and Curaleaf Hemp. Indeed, GTI recently announced the acquisition of Beboe,\nwhich will offer a CBD vape pen with a focus on gaining distribution in high-end retail\nstores. Curaleaf will offer their pen through its e-commerce platform and dispensaries.\n\nNotably, crossover does not pertain solely to cannabis companies, as Turning Point\nBrands recently announced a minority stake in CASH, a privately held CBD extraction\nand production company. With a rapidly growing vapor infrastructure in place already\n(from Vapor Beast, Vapor Shark and Vapor Supply), TPB has a number of avenues and\ndistribution points, both B2B and B2C, to introduce CBD vapor products to complement\nits portfolio. As such, we look for new CBD product introductions from TPB over the\nnext year, with vapor as a logical entry point and key focus area.\n\nFigure 98 Competition Expected to Heat Up Across Vapor\n\n$0.40 $030\n$0.30\n$0.20\n$0.10\n$0.00\n\n$027 so25 $024\n\nPure Kana\nPure Ratios\nCanna Hemp\nVape Bright\nDiamond CBD\nCuraleaf Hemp\n\nSuper Premium\n(> $0.23)\n\nTERP@EX\nRea Cannaths\nTerpenes\n\n$0.20 S018 $017 So46 $015 $0.14 $014 $014 ¢942 $012\n\nCBD Vape by Price Segment\n\n90.11 $0.10 $0.10 $0.10 $0.09 soos $0.07 $0.04\n\nMedix CBD\nVeedVerks\nCompany\nCBDistillery\nJust CBD\nFresh Leaf\nJolly Green Oil\n\nHemp Bombs\nFunky Farms\n\nPinnacle Hemp\nCarolina Hemp\n\nPure Hemp Botanicals\n\nMain\n($0.10-$0.17)\n\nVAPE PEN\neo VAPING\n\nCBD OIL\n;\ni tr) 2e\n=o\n\nNeng —_\n\n=\n| cbdMD-\n\nSource: Company Websites and Cowen and Company\n\nNote: Reflects price per mg of CBD; For companies with multiple SKUs, we used a straight line average\n\n52\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024868",
