It would be a relatively easy to gain access to passwords if\nSnowden had the cooperation of an insider at the center that had been read into the compartments\nor, even better, if he had the cooperation with a system administrator with the necessary PKI\ncards and shell keys to bypass the password protection. Such an accomplice could also help\nexplain how Snowden was able to get the job at the Center in the first place; how he knew in\nadvance that he could find there the “lists” of the NSA sources in foreign countries, and how he\nknew that there were no security traps at the center. Such a witting accomplice might even have\nprepared in advance the “spiders” that Snowden used to index the files.\n\nThe witting-accomplice scenario of course requires a somewhat unsettling expansion of the\nplot. It means Snowden collaborated with one or more insiders at the Center to steal secret\ndocuments. It is not difficult to imagine, in light of the lax background checks at outside\ncontractors servicing the NSA, that there were others in the “geek squad” that shared Snowden’s\nantipathy to NSA surveillance. Certainly, we know that Snowden found other NSA workers\nwho were willing to attend his anti-surveillance Crypto party in December 2012. Anyone of these\nother potential dissidents could have shared Snowden’s objective of exposing NSA abuses. It\nwould only be a small next step to offer Snowden help if he was willing to go public. Indeed, if\nthe geek culture produced one Snowden, why wouldn’t it produce others? If such an accomplice\nlacked Snowden’s willingness to flee to another country, he may have limited his participation to\nsupplying technical assistance. For his part, Snowden may have agreed to divert suspicion from\nhis accomplice by taking sole responsibility for the crime when he went public.\n\nThe problem with this scenario, however, is that no witting accomplices were ever found. The\nFBI, which was in charge of the domestic part of investigation of the Snowden case, questioned\nall of Snowden’s co-workers at the Center over the course of six months but it failed to find\nanyone who knowingly helped Snowden. If the accomplice was an idealistic amateur, it is likely\nthe FBI would have found him. Three co-workers did admit to the FBI that they might have\ninadvertently given Snowden their passwords but these three slips would not account for\nSnowden’s breach of all the other compartments. Of course, there may have also been less\nforthcoming co-workers hid their slips in divulging their passwords to Snowden.\n\nThis raises the more sinister possibility that the accomplice was not an amateur co-worker but a\ndeep-cover spy who was already in place when Snowden arrived on the scene. Such a\npenetration agent could have been recruited by an adversary intelligence service before Snowden\ncame on the scene. After Snowden expressed a desire to expose the NSA’s domestic\nsurveillance, it could then have used Snowden as an “umbrella” to hide its own activities. Finding\nsuch a means to protect a source while exploiting his or her information is not uncommon in\nespionage operations, and since Snowden was willing to flee America and go public, he could\nserve as a near perfect umbrella. “Snowden may have carried out of the NSA many more\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020274",
