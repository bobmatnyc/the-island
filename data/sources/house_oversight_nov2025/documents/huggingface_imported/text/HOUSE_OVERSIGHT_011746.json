  "text": "on security and foreign affairs. Barely three weeks after I joined the\ngovernment, we had to decide on the most important agreement with the\nPalestinians since Oslo. Dubbed Oslo II, it involved a major transfer of\nauthority and territory. The process would begin with our pulling out from more\nthan a quarter of the West Bank, including the major Palestinian towns and\nsome 450 smaller towns and villages. After that, there would be three further\nredeployment phases, at six-month intervals, in so-called “Area C” of the West\nBank — a mix of unpopulated land, settlements and a number of points we’d\ndesignated as strategically important. Under Oslo, and its parent agreement\nCamp David, it was all part of ensuring the Palestinians could exercise their\n“legitimate rights” in the “single territorial entity” of the West Bank and Gaza —\nin other words, a path to statehood. But only by the time the final three phases\nof redeployment were complete were we required to begin the “permanent-\nstatus” talks on issues like land and borders, Israeli settlements, the future of\nJerusalem: the real core of a peace agreement.\n\nBy the time I joined the discussions on Oslo I in August 1995, the main\npoints had already been agreed. Rabin was in favor, as were virtually all the\ncabinet ministers. Whatever scant influence I might exercise would have to\ncome at the decisive cabinet meeting, set for August 13. From the objections I’d\nraised to the Gaza-Jericho deal as chief of staff, Rabin knew I’d be concerned\nnot only to ensure the security provisions avoided potential misunderstandings\non the ground, but about the longer-term implications, especially since the scale\nof the Israeli withdrawals was much larger this time. In fact, the agreement\ncould be interpreted as requiring us to cede Palestinian control over virtually all\nof Gaza and West Bank by the end of the third redeployment phase —quite\npossibly before talks on the permanent-status questions had even begun.\n\nI went to see Rabin a few days before the cabinet vote. I explained why I\nthought the agreement was flawed. I argued we should either delay some of our\nredeployments or bring the permanent-status negotiations forward. He listened\nto me. He barely spoke. He knew I'd be against Oslo II, and knew the reasons\nwhy. But we both knew something else: having been brought into government\nby Rabin, I would be expected, on a vote of this importance, to be in his corner.\n\nThe cabinet vote wasn’t happening in a political vacuum. Likud’s defeat in\n1992 had meant the end of Yitzhak Shamir’s leadership. The new Likud leader\nwas the former Sayeret Matkal officer with whom I’d shared a newspaper cover\nin 1986 predicting that he and I would end up facing each other at the ballot\nbox: Bibi Netanyahu.
