  "text": "306 | Acknowledgments\n\nBecause I do not believe an investigative book should be written\nwithout the author visiting the crime scene and other pertinent ven-\nues, I undertook research in Hawaii, Japan, Hong Kong, and Moscow.\nWhere possible, I flew the same flights that Snowden did. I am grate-\nful to Ena and Ines Talakic for their assistance on these research trips.\nAs talented documentarians in their own right, they filmed a num-\nber of my interviews on these trips, and generously provided pho-\ntographs for this book. I thank Alexander Bitter in Hawaii, Joyce Xu\nin Hong Kong, Ko Shoiya in Japan, and Zamir Gotta, Natalie Filkina,\nand Svetlana Chervonnaya in Russia for their help in arranging my\ninterviews in those places. I also owe special thanks to Nick Grube,\nan editor at Civil Beat in Honolulu, for accompanying me to the\nNSA base where Snowden was working in 2013.\n\nI am indebted to Nancy Novick for her skill, patience and enter-\nprise in helping me find the selection of photographs for this book.\n\nlam grateful to Zachary Gresham for his meticulous fact-checking\nand proofreading, and to Ingrid Sterner for her immensely helpful\ncopyediting skills. Because I perform all my own research, I alone am\n\n© responsible for any errors that appear in this book. ®\n\nMort Janklow, who has represented me for three decades, did a\nsuperb job in arranging for Alfred A. Knopf to publish this book.\n\nTam thankful to Julia Ringo and the team at Knopf for their help\nin preparing this book. Finally, I am deeply indebted to Jonathan\nSegal for meticulously editing this book. The manuscript gained\nimmeasurably from both his keen eye and his wise judgment.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 306 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019794",
