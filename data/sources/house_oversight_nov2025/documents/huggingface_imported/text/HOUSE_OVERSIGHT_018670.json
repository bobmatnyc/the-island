  "text": "The book is filled with writing exercises that prompt readers to reflect on everything from\nbody image to sexual assault. It's essentially a guide to writing one's own personal sexual\nmanifesto.\n\nAmong BDSMers, an example of this approach is the multi-page checklists that some\nBDSMers use. (I already wrote about this in my piece \"Sex Communication Tactic\nDerived From S&M: Checklists,” reprinted earlier in this book; just in case you haven't\nread it, I'll briefly describe them.) Checklists are essentially lists of every conceivable\nBDSM.-related act; each act on the checklist looks something like this:\n\nFLOGGING -- GIVING O0O000\nFLOGGING -- RECEIVING O0O000\n\nEach partner rates each entry by filling out 1-5 bubbles, with 1 darkened bubble meaning\n\"Not interested\" and 5 bubbles meaning \"I crave this!\" This type of explicit\ncommunication is both an excellent way to help partners understand each other's desires\n-- and to help partners understand each other's boundaries. In a way, this sort of thing\ncould be seen as \"Master Class\" consent communication.\n\nThis was the context whence I emerged when I started investigating pickup artistry. Iam\na feminist, but I'm a flavor of feminist with a troubled history within the movement. I am\nan advocate for explicit communication, but I believe that no aspect of consent should be\nignored, and I am concerned that many feminists and BDSMers give a certain\nunwarranted privilege to explicit verbal communication over implicit or non-verbal\ncommunication.\n\nPeople seem likely to develop a preference for explicit communication if it seems more\nnecessary. For instance, many BDSMers develop a preference for explicit communication\nbecause our desires are unusual and precise, and complicated words will help us get what\nwe want. Feminists develop the same preferences because explicit communication is the\nclearest way to ensure sexual consent. Accordingly, some people attempt to promote\nexplicit sexual communication by saying: We should make it necessary.\n\nHere's an example exchange from the comments on a thoughtful feminist BDSM blog. A\nmale commenter asks:\n\nI once had an argument with a very good female friend of mine about kissing. She was\nperturbed about a date who asked her if he could proceed to kiss her. She said the man\nShould just know. It should be instinctual and u lose the moment as soon as u ask. I said\nthat was bs, the first move is one of the most nerve wracking things, the very fact that he\nasked shows his politeness and tact and frankly a lack of presumptuousness.... What do\nyou think? What's the line between politeness and passivity?\n\nThe feminist blogger, an intelligent and awesome lady who goes by the name Holly\nPervocracy, responds that:\n\nI don't say this very often, but \"you lose the moment as soon as you ask\" girls really are\nruining it for the rest of us.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, they can go without ever being kissed until they wise up.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018670",
