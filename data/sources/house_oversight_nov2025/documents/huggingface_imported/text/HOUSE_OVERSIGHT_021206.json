  "text": "already smitten. After pizza he walked me across the street to my hotel\nwhere we made plans to meet up again. There was no kiss goodnight or\nanything like that. No, he was too polite for that, he wanted to prove\nhimself different and different he was. Walking through the hotel’s\nrevolving doors I watched as he walked away and when he was finally\nout of sight, I sung my way up to my room. Floating on cloud nine I was\nfree falling into a deep pit of love.\n\nThe next day I attended my class as usual but not able to concentrate\nlike | normally did, too excited about when I’d be seeing Robbie that\nnight again. As I walked out of class that afternoon even the teacher\nnoticed a difference in my performance and asked me if I was feeling\nwell, “On top of the world actually” I smiled back at the old instructor\nand it wasn’t far from the exact truth either. [ hadn’t ever felt the\nchurning of butterflies in my stomach and the constant thoughts of\nanyone else like this before. My girlfriend and I got a tuk-tuk back\ntogether as we usually did after school and I couldn’t shut up about the\nnight before. She was laughing at my girlishness telling me that anyone\nwho just met me would think I had never been let out before, but little did\nshe know that | had more than my fair share in experience with men and\nnever had I ever come across anyone that could make me feel this way,\nand what spun me out even more was that it was such an instant\nattraction. Never considering myself a person who believed in the\nexistence of “Love at first sight”, but a true romantic deep at heart, |\ncouldn’t help but believe in it now. He is my walking proof of it!\n\nWaiting for me in the hotel lobby was the very person I couldn’t stop\nentertaining the thought of all day long, there he was looking ever so fine\nstanding in front of me now. The whole entire world faded away and all\nthat was left for the moment was this complete stranger I had only met\nlast night but somehow captivated the very essence of my very heart.\nThere was no need for me to try and act cool now. He already knew I was\nsnagged hook, line and sinker. Smiling all the way up the many stories in\nthe elevator up to my room he took notice of the posh décor of the hotel.\n“You should see where I’m staying, this is a royal palace compared to it”\nHis first impression of me he automatically thought I was going to be a\nspoiled high-maintenance girl that had money coming in from a parents\nhefty trust fund. Casually he got to find out through many deep and\nmeaningful conversations that my life’s grim story wasn’t that pretty at\nall. For some reason beyond my knowledge | had the need to tell this\nstranger almost everything.\n\nWanting to be judged and looked down upon for everything about my\nlife that I knew was wrong and being the first time I had spoken about my\nyears with Jeffrey to anyone honestly like that ever before, I had felt like\nI had deserved punishment. He offered me no judgment, instead only\n\n123\n\n|!

Encouraging me to see the worthiness of myself and leave that life\nbehind, he adorned me with a kind love that I wasn’t accustomed too.\n\nHe took me in and made me feel so at home. It was like I had known\nhim my whole life. I couldn’t bear to be without him another second\nwhile 1 was away on this dream holiday. When he wasn’t training for\nMuay-Thai tournaments and I wasn’t in school, nobody would ever see\nus. Too enveloped in each other in my hotel room to care about anything\nelse. Which is why I asked him to come stay at my hotel with me, seeing\nhe was never at his own anyways. My girlfriend was soon departing back\nto Wisconsin, making my room more than available for him. Enchanted\nby his words and tender touch, the way he made love to me was again\nlike nothing I had experienced before. Even down to after sex as | had\nbeen routinely instructed by Jeffrey to get up for a warm washcloth to\nclean his genitals afterwards, he refused it, telling me I was no longer a\nslave and that he didn’t want me acting like one. He’d just rather lay\ndown together afterwards and repeat our sweet nothings with many\nadjoining kisses.\n\nOn our third night together with nothing but the bed sheets between us,\nwe had spent all night looking into each other’s eyes sharing such an\nundeniable passion for one another. In the deepest caverns of my heart |\nknew this man would give me what I had never experienced\nbefore...True love. We were still laying in each others arms when the\norange and pink sunrise began to rise slowly through the peak’s of my\nrooms windows, enticing me to come feel the freshness of the morning’s\nchill. Only the bed sheets were still wrapped around my body as ] went\nthe balcony. It was overlooking the city in a valley surrounded by\nmountainous tops. My thoughts began to rampage through my head and }\nknew this could only be a dream for me. It was getting serious now, too\nserious for the life that I led back home. As if he sensed my anxiety\nRobbie walked up behind me and wrapped his strong arms around my\nwaistline, gently kissing my neckline and pausing with his ever so\nthoughtful stares and gave me the exact opening that I needed to expel\nmy thoughts. “Back home, as you already know, ] am going back to\nsomeone else, it’s my job, and as much as I really like you, this guy that I\nkind of see is going to expect me to be putting him first, I am so sorry to\nsay all of this after such a wonderful few days we have spent together, but\nyou need to know this thing happening between us can’t get anymore\nserious than what we have for now. | am so sorry” I looked down to the\nfloor with nothing else I could say to alter his perception of me now that I\nhad told him the truth and it never dawned on me that thought he\nwouldn’t be out the door before I could even finish my sentence but he\n\n124\n\nCopyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFRLQ04257\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021206",
