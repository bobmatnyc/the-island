  "text": "straight nights which replicated, as nearly as we could, what we intended to do\nacross the border in the Sinai. It was as if we’d never been there at all.\n\nYet there were the errors, setbacks and frustrations as well. Many months\ninto our planning, we conducted a series of run-throughs in which we simulated\nattaching the intercept to Israel’s telephone network in the south, not far from\nthe camp where I’d done my fironut. Though it all seemed to go as planned, the\nnext morning in rained heavily. Within hours, the phone company was getting\nreports from all around southern Israel of phones malfunctioning. Even\nallowing for the fact it rained less in the Sinai, we had to address the risk. I went\nto see the people in Meir Amit’s technology unit, and they began developing a\nwaterproofing system for the equipment.\n\nThe main problem with the equipment, however, was its sheer weight. The\nhelicopter could get us, and it, into Egypt. But we couldn’t fly directly to the\ncable site in the Sinai. We might just as well tell the Egyptians we were on our\nway. At around 1,100 pounds, it was much too heavy for us to carry. And if we\nwere going to go ahead with the mission, time was running short. A date for the\noperation had been set by the kirya: February 1964. I was not alone in believing\nthat, unless we cracked the problem of getting the equipment to the cable site,\nthe operation was impossible.\n\nThe solution came from a staff officer in military intelligence. Meir Amit\nvisited our base once a month to hear how the preparations were going. With the\ndate getting closer, he brought along his entire staff. When I raised my concern\nabout the weight problem, a colonel from his personnel section said: “Why not\nbuild a lightweight rickshaw, small enough to get in the door of the helicopter,\nbut which can carry all or most of the equipment once you’re on the ground?”\nWithin days, they had a prototype, made of airline-standard tubing and designed\nto be pulled by two men. We held an exercise in the Negev. But it was almost\nimpossible for two men to pull through the sand. It also left deep zig-zag\nimprints in the sand, which would surely raise the suspicions of the Egyptians.\n\nBut prototype number-two was a four-wheel, chrome alloy cart. The\ntechnology experts had made the axles telescopic, so the vehicle would get\nthrough the door of the chopper but could be expanded to the width of an\nEgyptian army Jeep. They had borrowed nose wheels from a training jet. To\ncomplete their oeuvre, they glued on real tire tread from one of the Egyptian\nJeeps we had captured in the 1956 war.\n\na\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011548",
