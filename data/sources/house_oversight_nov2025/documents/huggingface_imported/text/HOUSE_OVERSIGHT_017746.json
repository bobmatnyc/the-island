Rev. 835, *888\n\nIn its current form, Rule 32(c)(1)(B) suggests that the probation officer is required to include restitution information only in a\ncase covered by the MVRA because only then is restitution (in the language of the current rule) \"required.\" 22° No sound\nreason exists [*889] for such a limitation, particularly after the enactment of the CVRA. The CVRA guarantees that victims\nhave \"the right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\" *2? Even when the court is proceeding under the discretionary\nVWPA, without appropriate information in the presentence report, the court cannot determine whether to exercise its discretion\nto award restitution. Therefore, the rule should be changed to require that the presentence report contain restitution information,\nfrom which the court can determine whether to make a restitution award.\n\n(New) Rule 32(c)(3) - Probation Officer To Seek Out Victim Information\nThe Proposal:\n\nThe probation officer preparing a presentence report should be directed to determine whether a victim wishes to provide\ninformation for the report as follows:\n\n(3) Victim Information. The probation officer must determine whether any victim wishes to provide information for the\npresentence report.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nUnder the CVRA, the victim has \"the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving ...\nsentencing ... .\". 72° This right clearly encompasses the victim's right to allocate, or make an oral statement at sentencing, as\ndiscussed below in connection with Rule 32(i). 73! However, the right to be \"reasonably heard\" also appears to include the\nopportunity to provide information to the probation office during preparation of the presentence report.\n\nAs Senator Kyl explained, the victim's right to be heard at sentencing should be broadly construed:\n[*890]\n\n[The CVRA] provides victims the right to reasonably be heard at any public proceeding involving ... sentencing. This provision\nis intended to allow crime victims to directly address the court in person. It is not necessary for the victim to obtain the\npermission of either party to do so ... . When a victim invokes this right during ... sentencing proceedings, it is mtended that ...\nhe or she be allowed to provide all three types of victim impact: the character of the victim, the impact of the crime on the\nvictim, the victims’ family and the community, and sentencing recommendations ... .\n\nIt is not the intent of the term \"reasonably\" in the phrase \"to be reasonably heard\" to provide any excuse for denying a victim\nthe right to appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to\nappear personally and directly address the court. This section would fail in its intent if courts determined that written, rather\nthan oral communication, could generally satisfy this right. On the other hand, the term \"reasonably\" is meant to allow for\nalternative methods of communicating a victim's views to the court when the victim is unable to attend the proceedings. Such\ncircumstances might arise, for example, if the victim is incarcerated on unrelated matters at the time of the proceedings or if a\nvictim cannot afford to travel to a courthouse. In such cases, communication by the victim to the court is permitted by other\nreasonable means. 777\n\nIn light of this legislative history, victims undoubtedly have a right to make an in-court statement at sentencing as part of their\nright \"to be heard.\" But they also have the right to communicate in other ways with the court. At sentencing, an obvious\n\n228 Fed. R. Crim.
