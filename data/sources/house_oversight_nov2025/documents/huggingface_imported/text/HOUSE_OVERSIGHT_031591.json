The young, bright options trader, who\nunderstood Black Sholes and how to use it, at Bear, made good!!\n\nUnless your PR advisor is Donald Trump, I am not sure that current press provides you with much benefit.\nPerhaps I am wrong? Not the first time!!\n\nAnyway, middle age has brought its own unique set of challenges. Aging certainly ain’t for sissy’s.\n\nRegards,\n\nPs. David Asch and I toasted to you during our Thanksgiving weekend in Amagansett in November.\n\nChristina Galbraith\nMEDIA/PR\nJeffrey Epstein VI Foundation\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031591",
