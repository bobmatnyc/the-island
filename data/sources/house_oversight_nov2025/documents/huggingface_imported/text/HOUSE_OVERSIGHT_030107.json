  "text": "Former White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would\nhave acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such\ntechnology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership.\nIn her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and\nInfoSpan sold the bank a “bill of goods,” arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never\nworked and InfoSpan wasn’t as big a company as it claimed.\nThe bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the\nbank’s money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan’s employees, Ruemmler\ntold the jury.\n“They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded,” she said.\nLubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that \"Emirates\nBank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts.\"\nBajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn’t know his next steps.\n“T am just beat up,” he said.\nPhil Hirschkorn contributed to this report.\n\nis\nCopyright © 2016, Los Angeles Times<http://www.latimes.com/>\n\nFrank Pizzurro\nPublic Relations Senior Manager\n\nLATHAM & WATKINS LLP\n355 South Grand Avenue | Los Angeles, CA 90071-1560\n\nThis email may contain material that is confidential, privileged and/or attorney work product for the sole use of\nthe intended recipient.
