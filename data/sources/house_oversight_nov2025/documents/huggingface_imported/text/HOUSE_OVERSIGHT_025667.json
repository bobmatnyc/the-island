Division\n\nIllustrative Schematic: Centralized Network versus Distributed Network\n\nCentralized Network Distributed Network\n\n= Blockchain is the critical and differentiating infrastructure that underlies cryptocurrencies.\n\n= Unlike most networks today, which rely on a centralized hub, a blockchain is a public distributed network whose\ncomplete database can be accessed and maintained by each member of the network.\n\n# The blockchain is a shared and continually reconciled database. As new transactions occur, data is quickly\ndisseminated to, verified, and incorporated across all nodes on the network.\n\n= Because it has no single maintainer, the blockchain’s history is resistant to editing by a malicious actor.\n\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, http://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/how-does-cryptocurrency-work-2/ . 4\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025667",
