  "text": "61. In reasonable reliance on this and other information, Edwards served Maxwell for\ndeposition in 2009. See Deposition Notice attached as Exhibit “BB.” Maxwell was represented\nby Brett Jaffe of the New York firm of Cohen and Gresser, and Edwards understood that her\nattorney was paid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein. She was reluctant to give her\ndeposition, and Edwards tried to work with her attorney to take her deposition on terms that\nwould be acceptable to both sides.

He left messages for Epstein. One dated 4/1/05 said, “He has a teacher for you to\nteach you how to speak Russian. She is 2x8 years old, not blonde. Lessons are free and you can\nhave your 1\" today if you call.” See Messages taken from Jean Luc Brunel are attached hereto as\n\nExhibit “EE.” In light of these circumstances of the case, this message reasonably suggested to\n24\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013342",
