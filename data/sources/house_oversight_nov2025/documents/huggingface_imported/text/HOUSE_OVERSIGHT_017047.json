Example of grammatical change. Irregular verbs are used as a model of grammatical evolution.\nFor each verb, we plot the usage frequency of its irregular form in red (for instance, ‘found’), and the\nusage frequency of its regular past-tense form in blue (for instance, ‘finded’). Virtually all irregular verbs\nare found from time to time used in a regular form, but those used more often tend to be used in a\nregular way more rarely. This is illustrated in the top two rows with the frequently-used verb “find” and\nthe less often encountered “dwell”. In the third row, the trajectory of “thrive” is one of many ways by\n\n|”\n\nwhich regularization occurs. The bottom two panels shows that the regularization of “spill” happened\n\nearlier in the US than in the UK.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017047",
