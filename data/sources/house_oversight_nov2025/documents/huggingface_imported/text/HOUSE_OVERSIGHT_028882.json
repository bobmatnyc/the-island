  "text": "From: Lisa New\n\nSent: 10/27/2014 1:48:05 PM\nTo: Jeffrey Epstein [jeevacation@gmail.com]\nSubject: writing up proposal\n\nImportance: — High\nDear Jeffrey,\n\nLarry has told me that you and a friend would like to contribute to my project (hallelujah and thank you a\nmillion times, Jeffrey) and that I ought to write up a proposal asking for 500,000. This is wonderful. If this\ncomes to pass, the best way for that money to come, I think, is as a gift to Poetry in America, an initiative at\nEdLabs at Harvard University. This will give me discretion over its disbursement to HarvardX and WGBH, but\nthis will be absolutely be a Harvard gift that will count as Campaign success and from which Harvard will take\nsome (but not as much)overhead. . So far the best finance people I've met are at EdLabs and they are happy to\nmanage these funds for me. There are other ways to give me this money that leave Harvard out, but my\nunderstanding is that your friend would like this to be a Harvard gift.\n\nHere's a draft of what I'd like to do with that money.\n\nI'd like 500,000 to do post-production and distribution of a whole historical period of American poetry (1914-\n1945 is what I'm thinking--Modernism) and including three episodes of tv.\n\nThe raw materials for that period include interviews with Bill Clinton (including footage not yet used by\nWGBB), Peter Gallison, Walter Isaacson, Lena Dunham, Woody Allen (whose lawyers didn't like our release a\nwhile ago, but we're hoping will soften over time), Harrison Ford (still a maybe), Robert Polito, Sarah Kay, Al\nFilreis, Rafael Campo, Susan Howe, kids from Nantucket High School, kids from Brookline High\n\nSchool, Alfre Woodard, Jane Pickering, Jay Parini, Ray Dalio, Leon Wieseltier, Richard Dawkins and others;\nand footage shot in Harlem, Greenwich Village, midtown, Chicago, London (if I have the money to hire a crew\nthere; don't now ), at museums including the Fogg, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Frost's house in Ripton\nVermont and more.\n\nThis allows the donor to give to a big Harvard Campaign priority, Teaching and Learning , by supporting Poetry\nin America, allowing me to produce the crucial segment of the online course with the highest (TV quality)\nproduction values and so also supplying higher quality video to WGBH as a way also to cut their costs.\n\nCurrently, HarvardX skimps (on lighting, for instance--see the Bill Clinton interview) and while WGBH ladles\nmoney raised by others into everything. I have been pounding away at my friends at WGBH and I know that\nWGBH producer will work with HarvardX if they can give him footage of the right quality. . That is, we'll use\nHarvardX as the backlot for WGBH so as to squeeze three episodes out for 250.\n\nThis proposal does not include experiments in schools or the curricular development into courses for teachers\nthat you've seen in other (million dollar_) proposals. But the courses for teachers can't happen before the\nfootage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this funding\nwill make all the rest possible.\n\nI can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong.\nAnd I can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer, media\n\nmanager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at a\nsecond stage.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028882",
