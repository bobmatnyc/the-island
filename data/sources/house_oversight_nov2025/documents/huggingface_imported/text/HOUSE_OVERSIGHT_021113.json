The \nHillman Foundation established the award in 2005 to honor a labor historian who has made \nsignificant contribution to the field, researching and telling the stories of working peoples' lives. \nSince 1950, the Hillman's Prizes for Journalism honor the legacy of Sidney Hillman, an \nimmigrant who dedicated his life to a \"better America.\" Hillman believed that a free press was \nessential to a fair and equal society. The Sidney Hillman Foundation has sought to carry on his \nlegacy by honoring journalists who illuminate the great issues of our times—from the search for \na basis for lasting peace, to the need for better housing, medical care, and employment security \nfor all people, to the promotion of civil liberties and the battle against discrimination based on \nrace, nationality, or religion. \nFor more information, including to RSVP to the event, please contact Alexandra Lescaze at 646-\n448-6413 or Alex@HillmanFoundation.org \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021116 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021117 \nShare \nTweet \nForward \nView this email in your browser \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021118 \nCopyright © 2019 The Sidney Hillman Foundation, All rights reserved. \nYou are receiving this email because you opted in to our list. \nOur mailing address is: \nThe Sidney Hillman Foundation \n330 W. 42nd St., Suite 900  \nNew York, NY 10036  \nAdd us to your address book \nunsubscribe from this list update subscription preferences \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
