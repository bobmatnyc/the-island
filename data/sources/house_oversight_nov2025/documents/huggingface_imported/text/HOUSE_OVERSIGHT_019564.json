  "text": "76 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nWhen Snowden applied to Booz Allen earlier in March 2013, the\ncompany had no opening for a system administrator at the National\nThreat Operations Center, an NSA unit in which it dealt with\nLevel 3 data. It did have an opening for an infrastructure analyst, a\nlower-paying job involving maintaining the computer technology\nnecessary to monitor threats. Despite a cut in pay, Snowden took\nthat job. “Snowden was an IT guy, not a SIGINT analyst,” a former\nNSA Signals Intelligence officer pointed out. “He was working as a\ncontracted infrastructure analyst for NSA’s Information Assurance\narm,...[which, ironically as it turned out] protects classified U.S.\ncommunications from potential intruders.” Steven Bay, the manager\nat Booz Allen who hired and supervised Snowden, recalled that the\nfirst “red flag” came up soon after Snowden began he training, when\n“Snowden began asking about a highly classified mass-surveillance\nprogram” to which Snowden did not have access (although Bay did).\nIn retrospect, Bay realized that Snowden had applied for the job for a\nspecific reason. “He targeted our [Booz Allen] contract directly,” Bay\nsaid. “Somehow he figured out that our contract, and what we did\n\n© on that contract, were the types of gates he needed to get access to.” ®\n\nSnowden subsequently told the South China Morning Post that\nhe took this job to “get access to lists of machines all over the world\nthe NSA had hacked.” If so, he was after the keys to the NSA’s king-\ndom of global surveillance. Booz Allen held those keys. “He targeted\nmy company because we enjoy more access than other companies,”\nBooz Allen’s vice-chairman Michael McConnell said with the bene-\nfit of hindsight. As a result of the theft, he appraised, “an entire gen-\neration of intelligence was lost.” McConnell, a former NSA director,\nwas in a position to know.\n\nSnowden’s sudden career change had both advantages and disad-\nvantages for the enterprise he was planning. The main advantage\nwas that he would have proximity to the computers in which were\nkept the “lists” he sought of NSA global sources. The main disad-\nvantage, aside from a cut in salary, was that he would no longer be a\nsystem administrator. This change meant he would no longer have\nprivileges to bypass password restrictions or temporarily transfer\ndata. Instead, as an infrastructure analyst, he would not have pass-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 76 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019564",
