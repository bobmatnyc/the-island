  "text": "\"Our findings suggest that [so-called] real men experience their gender as a tenuous\nstatus that they may at any time lose and about which they readily experience anxiety and\nthreat.\" Earlier in the paper, they wrote that -- although \"our focus on manhood does not\ndeny the importance of women's gender-related struggles\" -- \"Women who do not live up\nto cultural standards of femininity may be punished, rejected, or viewed as 'unladylike,'\nbut rarely will their very status as women be questioned in the same way as men's status\noften is.”\n\nWhen is it to a man's disadvantage to publicly examine and question masculinity? Surely\nthe mere act of questioning and examining gender does not make a man less masculine;\nhow can we work against the perception that it does?\n\nAt the same time, though, this isn't a \"with us or against us” situation: men who don't\nchoose to identify as non-normative also don't tend to join the \"opposition.\" By\n\"opposition\" I mean folks like \"Men's Rights Activists\" (on the Internet we call them\nMRAs). MRAs -- at least according to my stereotype of them -- are conscious of social\nand legal disadvantages suffered by men, such as the fact that men are at a severe\ndisadvantage in child custody cases; at the same time, they're blind to male privilege. It's\na deadly combination. My personal favorite MRA quotation ever is, \"White men are the\nmost discriminated-against group in the country.\" Mercifully, MRAs are a fringe group,\nbut they make a big impression.\n\nMy \"not into gender studies\" friend once told me that although he frequently deconstructs\nproblems of masculinity in the privacy of his own mind, he doesn't like to publicly have\nthose conversations because he doesn't want to sound like an MRA. He said, \"A lot of the\ntime, men who want to think seriously about masculinity won't talk about it aloud\nbecause we really don't want to be that.\" He later added, \"It's very tricky to discuss\nmasculinity yet avoid simply devolving into male entitlement. That's the crux of the\nproblem with the 'Men's Movement’ assholes -- none of them are addressing the\nunderlying problems of masculinity. They're just whining about not receiving the\nprivileges their cultural conditioning tells them to expect.\"\n\nHow do the current \"men's rights movements\" discourage men who might, in a different\nclimate, be very interested in discussing masculinity? Assuming men can reclaim the\n\"pro-masculinity movement\" from MRAs, do any men feel motivated to do so? Can men\noccupy the middle ground between MRAs and LGBTQ, feminist, or other leftist\ndiscussions of gender -- that is, can men find space to discuss masculinity without being\naligned with \"one side or the other\"?\n\nAll too frequently in radical sex/gender circles, the theme has been blame. Men in\nparticular are excoriated for failing to adequately support feminism -- or criticized for\nfailing to join the fight against oppressive sex and gender norms -- but few ideas are\noffered for how men can be supportive and non-oppressive while remaining overtly\nmasculine, especially if their sexuality is normative (e.g., straight/dominant/big-dicked).\n\nThere are fragments: some insight might be drawn from the ways in which many BDSM\ncommunities create non-oppressive frameworks within which we have our deliciously\noppressive sex. With practice, one can get shockingly good at preserving a heavy\ndominant/submissive dynamic that still allows both partners to talk about their other\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018577",
