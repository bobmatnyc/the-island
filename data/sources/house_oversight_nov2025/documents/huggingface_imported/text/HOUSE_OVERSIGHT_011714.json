I said we needed to remind ourselves of the\narmy’s purpose: to protect Israel’s security and, if a war came, to win it. My\nbudgetary rule of thumb over the next four years would be simple: anything that\ndidn’t directly contribute to that mission was expendable. In fact, I put it a bit\nmore bluntly: “We need to cut anything that doesn’t shoot.”\n\nMy first attempt failed utterly. I proposed to close, or sell off, the army’s\nradio station, Galei Tzahal. Running it cost serious money. If we were going to\ncut everything that didn’t shoot, it was an obvious candidate. But what I failed\nto take into account was its popularity with the listening public. Although other\nradio stations had opened recently, for many years it had been the only major\nalternative to the state-funded Kol Yisrael. It also provided a training ground\nand employment feeder for future journalists. Galei Tzahal’s alumni included\nsome of the country’s top media figures, and more than a few members of the\nKnesset. Within weeks, a lobbying effort was underway to “save” the station. I\nwent to see Misha. He agreed that, from a military and budgetary standpoint,\nclosing it was the right thing to do. But in an early lesson in how different\npolitics were from the army, he told me that politically, it simply wasn’t going\nto fly. “Drop it, Ehud,” he said. So I did.\n\nStill, I did end up fundamentally retooling the armed forces during my time\nas chief of staff. We developed agile new strike forces and high-precision, high-\ntech weapons systems with “stand-off” munitions designed to be fired from\nmany miles away. In the 1973 war, and for the decade or two that followed,\nSaggers, and the US-made TOW missiles that Israel acquired after the war, had\nthe capability to transform a battlefield. Now, Israeli developers came up with\nsmall, ground-launched missiles that could take out a tank from five to 10 miles\naway, even without a direct line of sight to the target. Of even more long-term\nmilitary significance, I pushed ahead with developing pilotless drones — so-\ncalled UAVs — making us the first army in the world to produce and deploy\nthem.\n\nYet for a security challenge like the intifada, even the most advanced stand-\noff munitions or UAVs offered no practical answer. The latest stage in the\nviolence involved knife attacks by Palestinians against Israeli civilians, both on\nWest Bank settlers and inside Israel. Days after I took over, a 26-year-old from\nGaza, wielding a butcher’s knife and shouting Alahu Akhbar, killed four people,\n\n243\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011714",
