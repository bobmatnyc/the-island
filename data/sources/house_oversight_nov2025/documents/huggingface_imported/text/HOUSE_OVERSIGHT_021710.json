Epstein is American so was the girl. And we all know how morally corrupt the rest of the Maxwell\nfamily were/are, Prince Andrew is not the epitome of being English. What you are talking about is related to a small minoirty of\nindividuals who just happen to be English. If they behave badly, then it says something about them, their chosen lifestyle, or\nthe circles they move around in. What it does NOT, is have any bearing on the rest of the nation! So please, let's not get into\nprovocative Scottish vs English battle - history is what it is - the PAST. And | certainly won't be accountable for what someone\nelse did long before | was born or simply beacause | am also English. | am proud to be English, that is what | am.
