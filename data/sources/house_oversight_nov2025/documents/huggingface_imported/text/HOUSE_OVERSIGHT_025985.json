Data from Nov-28 to Aug-16.\n\nUsing the VIX term structure in the Sep/Oct/Nov buckets and\nadjusting for term structure/day convention (see footnote to\nChart 13), we estimate the option markets’ implied move over a\nsingle day in the Oct-Nov period (which encompasses the US\nelection on 8-Nov).\n\nOur estimated implied move is 1.4% which is notably very close\nto the typical 1-day post-election day SPX realized move over\npast election cycles (1.5% since 1928) (see Chart 14).\n\nImportantly, there is a larger-than-typical variation in the\ndistribution of all daily post-election SPX returns (34.0 vol pts\nvs. 18.4 vol pts for daily SPX returns since Jan-1928), with the\nlargest and the fourth largest daily post-election SPX returns\nsince 1928 occurring in the last two election cycles alone (see\nChart 14).\n\nHence, investors who believe this /s not your typical election (to\nquote President Obama at the latest Democratic National\nConvention) may still find that option markets are currently\npricing too little of a move.\n\nHowever, as we have recently argued the debate about whether\na Trump win would be good or bad for markets coupled with the\ninability to exactly pinpoint real risks are likely headwinds to a\nsizeable market shock.\n\n8 Global Equity Volatility Insights | O09 August 2016\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025985",
