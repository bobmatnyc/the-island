Accordingly, the Board\nassumes for purposes of this analysis\nthat the great majority of the nearly 6\nmillion small businesses will be\naffected, and further that this number is\na substantial number within the\nmeaning of 5 U.S.C. 601. However, as\ndiscussed below, because the economic\nimpact on those employers is minimal,\nthe Board concludes that, under 5\nU.S.C. 605, the final rule will not have\na significant economic impact on any\nsmall employers.\n\nThe RFA does not define ‘‘significant\neconomic impact.” 5 U.S.C. 601. In the\nabsence of specific definitions, “what is\n‘significant’ * * * will vary depending\non the problem that needs to be\naddressed, the rule’s requirements, and\nthe preliminary assessment of the rule’s\nimpact.” See A Guide for Government\nAgencies: How to Comply with the\nRegulatory Flexibility Act, Office of\nAdvocacy, U.S. Small Business\nAdministration at 17 (available at\nhitp://www.sba.gov) (SBA Guide). As to\neconomic impact and whether it is\nsignificant, one important indicator is\nthe cost of compliance in relation to\nrevenue of the entity or the percentage\nof profits affected. Id. at 17. More\nspecifically, the criteria to be considered\nare:\n\ne Whether the rule will lead to /ong-\nterm insolvency, i.e., regulatory costs\nthat significantly reduce profits;\n\ne Whether the rule will lead to short-\nterm insolvency, i.e., increasing\noperating expenses or new debt more\nthan cash reserves and cash flow can\nsupport, causing nonmarginal firms to\nclose;\n\ne Whether the rule will have\ndisproportionate effects, placing small\nentities at a significant competitive\ndisadvantage; and\n\ne Whether the rule will result in\ninefficiency, i.e., in social costs to small\nentities that outweigh the social benefits\nresulting from the rule. Id. at 26.\n\nApplying these standards, the Board\nconcludes that the economic impact of\nits notice-posting rule on small\nemployers is not significant. The Board\nhas determined that the average cost of\ncomplying with the rule in the first year\nfor all employers subject to the NLRA\nwill be $64.40. It is unlikely in the\nextreme that this minimal cost would\nlead to either the short- or long-term\ninsolvency of any business entity, or\nplace small employers at a competitive\ndisadvantage. Since this rule applies\nonly to organizations within the NLRB’s\njurisdictional standards, the smallest\nemployer subject to the rule must have\n\nan annual inflow or outflow across state\nlines of at least $50,000. Siemons\nMailing Service, 122 NLRB 81 (1959).\nGiven that the Board estimates that this\ntule will cost, on average, $64.40, the\ntotal cost for the smallest affected\ncompanies would be an amount equal to\nless than two-tenths of one percent of\nthat required annual inflow or outflow\n(.13%). The Board concludes that such\na small percentage is highly unlikely to\nadversely affect a small business.193\nAnd, in the Board’s judgment, the social\nbenefits of employees’ (and employers’)\nbecoming familiar with employees’\nNLRA rights far outweigh the minimal\ncosts to employers of posting notices\ninforming employees of those rights.194\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the\nBoard has concluded that the final rule\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities. 5 U.S.C. 605.\n\nAs discussed in the NPRM, because it\nassumes that a substantial number of\nsmall businesses will be required to\ncomply with the rule, the Board\npreliminarily considered alternatives\nthat would minimize the impact of the\ntule, including a tiered approach for\nsmall entities with only a few\nemployees. However, as it also\nexplained, the Board rejected those\nalternatives, concluding that a tiered\napproach or an exemption for some\nsmall entities would substantially\nundermine the purpose of the rule\nbecause so many employers would be\nexempt under the SBA definitions.\nGiven the very small estimated cost of\ncompliance, it is possible that the\nburden on a small business of\ndetermining whether it fell into a\nparticular tier might exceed the burden\nof compliance. The Board further\npointed out that Congress gave the\nBoard very broad jurisdiction, with no\nsuggestion that it wanted to limit\ncoverage of any part of the NLRA to\nonly larger employers. The Board also\nbelieves that employees of small\nemployers have no less need of a Board\nnotice than have employees of larger\nemployers. Finally, the Board’s\njurisdictional standards mean that very\nsmall employers will not be covered by\nthe rule in any case. 75 FR 80416. (A\nsummary of the Board’s discretionary\njurisdictional standards appears in\n§ 104.204, below.) Thus, although\n\n193 Tn reaching this conclusion, the Board believes\nit is likely that employers that might otherwise be\nsignificantly affected even by the low cost of\ncompliance under this rule will not meet the\nBoard’s jurisdictional requirements, and\nconsequently those employers will not be subject to\nthis rule.\n\n194 See further discussion in section II, subsection\nC, Factual Support for the Rule, above.\n\nseveral comments urge that small\nemployers be exempted from the rule,\nthe Board remains persuaded, for the\nreasons set forth in the NPRM, that such\nan exemption is unwarranted. 195\n\nSome comments contend that, in\nconcluding that the proposed rule will\nnot have a significant impact on small\nemployers, the Board understates the\nrule’s actual prospective costs. One\ncomment, from Baker & Daniels LLP,\nargues that the Board improperly\nfocuses solely on the cost of complying\nwith the rule—i.e., of printing and\nposting the notice—and ignored the\n“actual economic impact of the rule’s\neffect and purpose.” According to this\ncomment, it is predictable that, as more\nemployees become aware of their NLRA\nrights, they will file more unfair labor\npractice charges and elect unions to\nserve as their collective-bargaining\nrepresentatives. The comment further\nasserts that the Board has ignored the\n“economic realities of unionization,”\nspecifically that union wages are\ninflationary; that unions make business\nless flexible, less competitive, and less\nprofitable; and that unions cause job\nloss and stifle economic recovery from\nrecessions. Accordingly, this comment\ncontends that ‘‘the Board’s RFA\ncertification is invalid, and [that] the\nBoard must prepare an initial regulatory\nflexibility analysis.” Numerous other\ncomments echo similar concerns, but\nwithout reference to the RFA.\n\nThe Board disagrees with the\ncomment submitted by Baker & Daniels\nLLP.196 Section 605(b) of the RFA states\nthat an agency need not prepare an\ninitial regulatory flexibility analysis if\nthe agency head certifies that the rule\n\n195 Cass County Electric Cooperative says that,\nafter estimating the average cost of compliance, “the\nNLRB quickly digresses into an attempt to estimate\nhe cost of the proposed rule on only small\nbusinesses.” The Board responds that in estimating\nhe cost of the rule on small businesses, it was\ndoing what the RFA explicitly requires (and that\nocusing on small businesses, which comprise more\nhan 99 percent of potentially affected firms, is\nhardly a “digression”). The comment also asserts\nhat the Board concluded “‘that the cost of\nestimating the implementation cost will likely\nexceed the cost of implementation, and thus is not\nwarranted. At best, this is a poor excuse to justify\nhe rule.” This misstates the Board’s observation\nhat “Given the very small estimated cost of\ncompliance, it is possible that the burden on a small\nbusiness of determining whether it fell into a\nparticular tier might exceed the burden of\ncompliance.” This observation was one of the\nreasons why the Board rejected a tiered approach\nto coverage for small entities, not an ‘excuse to\njustify the rule.” 75 FR 80416.\n\n196 In any event, the comment from Baker &\nDaniels LLP and related comments are difficult to\nsquare with the assertions made in numerous other\ncomments that the notice posting is unnecessary\nbecause employees are already well aware of their\nNLRA rights and have made informed decisions not\nto join unions or seek union representation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022314",
