  "text": "15\n\nAllawi's Iragiya bloc, or whether different parties, or sects, would\nrotate within its leadership in future years.\n\nIraqis need to decide whether the council's leader will always be a\nShi'ite, given that Allawi is Shi'ite, or whether Sunnis, Kurds and\nChristians will be entitled to compete for the post. If the new council\nwill have powers equal to that of the prime minister, will it become\npart of the sectarian division of power in Iraq? Will it become a\npermanent seat that is given to the \"second runner up\" in any\nparliamentary election? And what will its status become if Allawi\nbecomes prime minister one day?\n\nWould it stay with Allawi's team or will it go to the \"defeated\"\ncoalition in parliament? If this is the case, it needs to be said, either in\nwriting or gentleman's agreement; especially that in today's case,\nAllawi's team is not a minority in parliament, but actually, the\ncoalition with the largest number of seats.\n\nSami Moubayed is a university professor, historian, and editor-in-\nchief of Forward Magazine in Syria.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030282",
