Those claims that fly in the face of a 2002 New York Magazine interview in\nwhich Trump claimed to have known Epstein for 15 years.\n\n“He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and\n\nmany of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life,”\nTrump told reporters.\n\npos and corrections to corrections@rawstor\n\nNEXT ON RAW STORY >\n\nGleeful Democrats see Trumpcare as political suicide for House GOP:\n\n‘They are staring death in the face’\n\nBy commenting, you agree to our terms of service and to abide by our commenting policy\n\n| an\n\n57 COUNTY CLERKS SEND LETTER TO GOV.
