  "text": "13\n\nNor did Snowden’s breach begin with him handing over classified documents to the Guardian\nreporters in Hong Kong in June 2013 or, for that matter, in the eleven days prior to his meeting\nwith journalists in 2013. He had, as the NSA quickly determined begun illicitly copying\ndocuments in the late summer of 2012. Such an enterprise does not emerge from thin air. Even if\nhe had managed to elude American intelligence from late May to early June 2013, he could not\nhide all the history that led to his decision to come to Hong Kong. There had to be an envelope\nof reality surrounding it, including Snowden’s motivation, associates, movements, finances, and\nhis activities prior to his fleeing to Hong Kong. What was missing was not just Snowden’s first\n11 days in Hong Kong but the entire context of the alleged crime. I now needed to fill in that\nenvelope of reality in America. I left Hong Kong for New York on June 2, 2014 two days after\n\nmy meeting with the former official of the consulate.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020165",
