While there\nare intellectually convincing new rationales for the project, including\nthe rise of non-Western giants such as China, rationales are no match\nfor emotional motivators. The key to so much of this, especially on\nthe economic side, is Germany. For much of its history, what has\nbecome the European Union pursued political ends by economic\nmeans. For Kohl and Mitterrand, the euro was mainly a political\nproject, not an economic one. Now the boot is on the other foot. To\nsave a poorly designed and overextended monetary union, the\npolitical must ride to the rescue of the economic. That will require\nAngela Merkel's leadership. If we are talking about the European\neconomy and currency, Germany is the indispensable power. Only\nthe combination of Germany and the European Central Bank,\nworking in unison, has a chance of calming the mighty markets.\n\nFor more than a year now, Merkel has attempted to find the narrow —\nperhaps nonexistent — line where the minimum that can be done to\nsave the embattled Eurozone periphery meets the maximum she\nthinks German public opinion will bear. She has then tried to win her\nEurozone partners to that course. So far, it has not worked. Now she\nneeds to start from the other end: Work out, with the central bank and\nother Eurozone governments, what is the best, most credible deal\navailable, and then put all her authority on the line to convince a\nreluctant German public that this is in the long-term, enlightened\nnational self-interest of Germany. And it is. For no one has more to\nlose from the disintegration of the Eurozone than the Continent's\ncentral economic power. It may soon be too late.\n\nTimothy Garton Ash, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a senior\n\nfellow at the Hoover Institution and professor of European studies at\nOxford University.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018102",
