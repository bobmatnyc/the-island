  "text": "CHAPTER 52\n\nJeffrey Epstein: June 30, 2008\n\nhe Palm Beach County Main Detention Center is on the\nwest side of Lake Worth Lagoon, which separates West\n4 Palm Beach from the island of Palm Beach. Epstein’s\n_ home on El Brillo Way is five miles to the east. Mary’s high\n' school is several miles to the west.\n\nIts fitting, somehow, that this jail—which is the jail Epstein\n\"ends up in, after turning himself in to the local sheriff—lies in\n| between the two points.\n\na The detention center’s inmates, their families, and their law-\nJ yers call it the Gun Club, a reference not only to the jail’s address,\non Gun Club Road, but also to its population of hustlers, bur-\na ts, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. There’s the occa-\nsional hooker as well. And, from time to time, Haitian refugees\nre lodged there.\n\nThere are three thousand inmates in all.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010539",
