  "text": "NAUTIL.US | TEXT SETS\n\nIntroducing\nNautilus Education\n\nThe modern world has placed an unprecedented emphasis on\nscience literacy. But most existing science texts do not emphasize\nliteracy, and most literary texts don’t have science.\n\nThis Nautilus Education text set pamphlet 1s a beta product\nintended to fill this gap. It contains three groups of articles from the\naward-winning science magazine, Nautilus, each accompanied by lesson\nplans and guides for teachers.\n\nKey science concepts like genetics and astronomy are explored\nthrough narrative story telling and tailor-made artwork, letting science\nspill over rts usual borders, and waking the imagination and interest of\nthe student. This kind of literary science classroom material was\ndesigned to helps teachers satisfy the new U.S. common core and\nnext gen standards but have global application. The relevant standards\nare listed in each lesson plan.\n\nNautilus is looking for partners interested in using and further\ndeveloping this kind of content. For more information, please write\nto education@nautil.us.\n\n—Michael Segal\nEditor-in-Chief\n\nAbout Nautilus Magazine\nNautilus is a new kind of science magazine. Each monthly issue tackles\na single topic in contemporary science using multiple vantage points,\nfrom biology and physics to culture and philosophy. We are science,\nconnected.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015463",
