I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive when\nI get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam (who was as\nalways very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not feel like\nconceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that humans have\nvery specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other ideas), and his\nfrustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them.\n\nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a\ncultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, but\nit seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a very\nintricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition works\nlayer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few years to\ntrain in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and after the low\nlevel learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in child\ndevelopment, that have famously been described by Piaget.\n\nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The\nswitching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in other\napes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their brains are\nmature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations are quite a bit\nfaster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in very poor and\nsocially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive development even\nafter controlling for family income.\n\nGorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4\nyears. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their brains\nhave the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are literally\nsmarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower levels, they\ncan perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to train them.\n\nThe second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention\nto, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual\nwill find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. Ifa brain gets lots of rewards for discovering\nother people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition.\n\nLanguage might be the result of three things that are different in humans:\n\n- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of\nphonemes or the first language)\n\n- more layers\n\n- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us\nlike music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making themselves\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025957",
