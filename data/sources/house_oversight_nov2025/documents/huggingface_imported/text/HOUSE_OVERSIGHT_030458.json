We set the\nnews agenda for the BBC and in many respects we set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews\nare regularly re broadcast across the BBC's national and international news network including - BBC World,\nBBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of these outlets means the global 'reach' of a BBC\nToday programme interview is second to none.\n\nProgramme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international\nrelations and the arts including US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President Nicholas Sarkozy, President\nHamid Karzai, HRH the Prince of Wales, former President Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza\nRice, former President Bill Clinton, Senator George Mitchell, Al Gore, Kofi Annan, former Prime Minister\nTony Blair, the Dalai Lama, Bill Gates, George Soros, Stephen Hawking, Sir Paul McCartney, Mick Jaggar\nand Salman Rushdie.\n\nWe are a programme that carries considerable weight and influence and which prides itself in being a first port\nof call for many of the most important and influential figures on the international stage.\n\nI can best be reached via my cell phone - I or this email address.\nMy very best wishes and my thanks!\nKirsty\n\nKirsty MacKenzie,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030458",
