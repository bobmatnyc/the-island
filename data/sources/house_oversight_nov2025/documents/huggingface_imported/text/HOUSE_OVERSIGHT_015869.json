  "text": "ealth warning! The man who discovered infinity had a mental\n\nbreakdown. This subject may tax your brain.\n\nGeorg Cantor didn’t really ‘discover’ infinity but he was the first\nmathematician to put it on a firm theoretical footing. In the late 19\"\ncentury, most mathematicians thought infinity was a curious idea with\nno proper place in mathematics. They treated Cantor's attempts to make\nit into a real mathematical object with contempt. This affected Cantor’s\nmorale and caused him to suffer several bouts of deep depression,\nretreating to a sanatorium from time to time.\n\nInfinity is a difficult idea to grasp but it is vital to our study of\ninformation. It behaves counter-intuitively but is not impossible to grasp.\nThe reason it is important is that information can always be translated\ninto numbers and numbers go on to infinity. If you want to know all\nabout information, you must understand infinite numbers.\n\nHistory\n\nIndian scholars began studying infinity in the 4 Century BC. It turns\nup naturally in all manner of places. In geometry, parallel lines extend\nforever in either direction without ever meeting. To define a parallel line\nyou must contemplate infinity. In arithmetic, even if you pick the largest\nnumber you can imagine, there is always a larger one; just add one. In the\nphysical world if you look up at the night sky it appears to go on forever.\nAgain you have infinity.\n\nHistorically there were two interpretations of infinity. The first,\nfavored by Plato, was a journey. When you embark upon a journey, you\ncan always take another step. Infinity is the idea of ‘one more’ or never-\nending. It can never be reached. The second definition is more radical.\nInfinity is a thing, a number so bigyou could not imagine anything bigger,\nbut it is one number. Plato thought this second definition tantamount to\nmadness. Today we embrace this madness and go a whole lot further. Let\nme show you how.\n\nIfinfinity were a number, you should be able to perform mathematics\nwith it; add it, multiply it, and even raise it to a power. This is not as\nradical as it might first seem. Until comparatively recently, zero was not\naccepted as a number - if you consider recent to be one thousand years!\nNowadays it is.\n\nAt the end of the first millennium Indian scholars found, against\ntheir intuition, that you can use zero as a number without generating\ncontradictions. Take addition. I can have zero cakes, add one, and I\nhave one cake, add another, and have two cakes and so on. In this way,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015869",
