  "text": "passion and madness that sent the heart into spasms and pressed the mind to\ndistraction. This was about the last thing a new state needed. “Poetry mustn't be\ntaken seriously as a serious thing laying hold of truth,” Socrates warns. “The man\nwho hears it must be careful, fearing for the regime in himself.” Thus: Hesiod’s\nmagnificent Works and Days, banned. Homer, banned. There has always been, about\npoetry, this sense of the magical, that it was a key to something intimately bound to\nthe human mystery. It was no surprise to me to find, when I went back to re-read\nTuring’s “Can Machines Think?” essay, that the very first thing the great\nmathematician dreamed up to ask a digital brain was: “Write me a sonnet.” Poetry\nhas always marked a test. Socrates and Plato gatekeep the poets out of their republic\nbecause they know the mad part of the soul verse can touch. It is hard to blame\nthem. After all, they were among the earliest Western minds to try to dispel\nmadness and superstition and sophistry. Without their logic and effort there would\nbe no Aristotle, no science, none of the sense of our world as a comprehensible\nmachine. The confidence to philosophize - which for them meant also to poke at the\npolitical wiring of our world - demanded the break from poetry and mysticism as a\nsource of action or legitimacy. Had they failed, we'd still be in the dark. But had they\ncompletely succeeded? We'd hardly be human.\n\nYou know, as I’ve said, when I first moved to China, there were so many things that\nbaffled me. (There still are, to be honest.) But very high on that list was a peculiarity\nof ancient Chinese political life. For thousands of years the greatest poets and\npainters had also been emperors and politicians. Su Dongpo, for instance, the official\nwho turned the lake city of Hangzhou into one of the great cultural centers of human\nhistory is also one of China’s best regarded poets. The calligraphy of the Qing\ndynasty Mingzhen Emperor is marked with a temprament of transcendent delicacy.\nIt’s not merely that we'd never seriously expect a Western political figure to make\ngreat art - or even to have interesting ideas or be able to write these days. It’s not\neven that many of the most significant Chinese political documents are paintings of\nmountains or rivers, that even letters from high officials are often rated as great art.\n\nMy first encounter with this strange mix, art and power mingled, produced a\npredictable Western reaction: It’s amazing how many “Renaissance Men” China had, |\nthought. These officials seemed to have mastered so many different talents. What I\ndid not understand was that these men had not, in fact, mastered many different\ntalents, at least not in any way I might understand it. They were not “Renaissance\nMen”, but actually a different breed, operating on a deeper level. They had mastered\none skill. This was the cultivation of a finely-tuned inner energy - an instinct\npowerful enough that it could be turned with equal ease to calligraphy or warfare.\nThis sort of effort took time. It demanded that knife-in-the-leg focus of Su Qin. And it\ndemanded faith that some sort of enlightenment would in fact take place. For this,\nthey had thousands of years of history as proof. Once this breakthrough to inner\nknowledge happened, once they developed a fine sensitivity to the underlying force\nof power, then they could tap into it for anything. Fighting wars. Counseling princes.\nFishing. Composing poetry.\n\n202\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018434",
