According to Greenwald, the NSA vastly exagger-\nated the magnitude of the theft in order to “demonize” Snowden.\nSnowden also disputed the magnitude of the 1.7 million number. He\ntold James Bamford of Wired in early 2014 that he took far fewer\nthan the 1.7 million documents that the NSA reported were com-\npromised. He offered, however, no more specific details on the mag-\nnitude of his theft. Nor did he offer Bamford any way to verify his\nassertion other than to say that he had purposely left behind “a trail\nof digital bread crumbs” at the NSA base in Hawaii so that the NSA\ncould determine which documents he “touched” but did not down-\nload. A government official familiar with the investigation said no\nsuch “bread crumbs” were found by the NSA.\n\nIt is possible that the NSA Damage Assessment team under Led-\ngett falsified its findings or otherwise inflated the number of doc-\numents that Snowden stole. NSA executives might have also lied\nto Congress to exaggerate the loss. But why would these officials\nengage in an orchestrated deception that made them look bad? Exag-\n\n© gerating the magnitude of the theft would only magnify Ledgett and ©\nthe NSA’s failure in its mission to protect U.S. secrets.\n\nOfficials had no reason to demonize Snowden for legal reasons.\nHe already had been. Greenwald and Poitras had already revealed\nthat Snowden had given them a vast number of NSA classified docu-\nments ona thumb drive that revealed, as Greenwald put it, the “blue-\nprints” of the NSA. This drive contained, it will be recalled, no fewer\nthan 58,000 highly classified documents. In the eyes of the law, that\nconstituted an unprecedented breach of the laws passed to protect\ncommunications intelligence. In any case, in Russia Snowden was\nnot in any jeopardy, no matter how many documents he was said to\nhave stolen. Interestingly, the thirty-five-page Defense Intelligence\nAgency’s damage assessment reports that 900,000 Pentagon docu-\nments compromised by Snowden were not made public. That was\nonly disclosed via a Vice magazine Freedom of Information request\nin June 2015.\n\nMany of the putative 1.3 million documents that the NSA says\nwere copied and moved were duplicate copies. Others were outdated\nor otherwise useless routing data. So the quantity does not tell the\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 171 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019659",
