  "text": "David Kaiser is a physicist atypically interested in the intersection of his science with\npolitics and culture, about which he has written widely.\n\nIn the first meeting (in Washington, Connecticut) that preceded the crafting of this\nbook, he commented on the change in how “information” is viewed since Wiener’s time:\nthe military-industrial, Cold War era. Back then, Wiener compared information,\nmetaphorically, to entropy, in that it could not be conserved—i.e., monopolized; thus, he\nargued, our atomic secrets and other such classified matters would not remain secrets for\nlong. Today, whereas (as Wiener might have expected) information, fake or not, is\nleaking all over the other Washington, information in the economic world has indeed\nbeen stockpiled, commodified, and monetized.\n\nThis lockdown, David said, was “not all good, not all bad’”—depending, I guess,\non whether you’re sick of being pestered by ads for socks or European river cruises\npopping up in your browser minutes after you’ve bought them.\n\nTo say nothing of information’s proliferation. David complained to the rest of us\nattending the meeting that in Wiener’s time, physicists could “take the entire Physical\nReview. /t would sit comfortably in front of us in a manageable pile. Now we’re awash\nin fifty thousand open-source journals per minute,” full of god-knows-what. Neither of\nthese developments would Wiener have anticipated, said David, prompting him to ask,\n\n“Do we need a new set of guiding metaphors?”\n\n108\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016328",
