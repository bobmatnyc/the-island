  "text": "crisis, they were declared and (made) clear-cut. There was no need to unleash predictions in this respect,” His\nHighness said.\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYYour Highness, do you feel that Dubai is threatened as a result of the current crisis?\n\nWe did not at any time feel that the financial crisis is a threat. The worst is over and behind us. Since the\neruption of the crisis we did not hear of any state-owned bank or company announcing bankruptcy. None of the\neconomy sectors was snapped. We are currently implementing plans and programs of action to benefit from the\nlessons of the crisis and ensure the recovery of the negative effects.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nThe recent murders that occurred in Dubai seriously raised the issue of security despite\nthe speed of discovery of the perpetrators of these crimes. How would you respond to the\nstatements that the prevention of the assassination should come first?\n\nOf course, prevention is better than cure. To prevent killing is a very valuable act. Often, people hear about the\ncure procedures, but they do not hear about the actions of prevention. Murders that took place in Dubai in\nrecent months, were fewer than half of one hand’s fingers -- and this is not to minimize the seriousness but just\nto confirm that it is an exception and the rule is that the UAE, including Dubai, is one of the most secure and\nstable countries, and this would not happen without having our authorities taking preventive measures of\nutmost importance. In any case, the crime rate in the UAE, including Dubai, is one of the lowest in the world,\nand we are working to remain so, and the murder of two known figures will not change the reality.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nWith the brunt of the global financial crisis on Dubai, we noticed the continuation of most\nof the art, culture, media, sports, and cultural activities, in addition to the enormous\nfinancial awards being bestowed by various organizations for business efficiency, among\nother things. How do you explain this?\n\nThese activities were scheduled prior to the crisis, and some of them are annual events such as the Dubai World\nCup, the Arab Media Forum and Arab Journalism Award. Some new events were launched, such as the World\nPoetry Festival -- but I don’t know why you are wondering about the continuation of those activities. In fact, it\nwould be a strange thing to cancel them. With regards to the prizes, they remain as were previously announced.\nDo you suggest in your question that these awards have become a burden to Dubai? If so, I promise we are ina\ngood shape. All our projects under implementation have not ceased, and we are paying our loans and debts on\ntime, and all suppliers and contractors have begun to receive their entitlements.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, the media is focusing currently on the large layoffs from the companies\nworking under the umbrella of Dubai Holding. What is the truth regarding this matter,\nespecially that the issue is going to reach its peak in the coming months?\n\nThe collapse of the global debt markets has pushed all the big companies worldwide to review their plans, expe\nnses and strategies and urged them to restructure their managements including the human resources. “Dubai\nHolding” is not an exception at all. All its companies work on a commercial basis, and it is normal to lay off the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024935",
