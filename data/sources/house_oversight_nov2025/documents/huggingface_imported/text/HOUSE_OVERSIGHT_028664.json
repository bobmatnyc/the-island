  "text": "when it would no longer be the number one power in the world. In his\n2003 Yale University address on “Global Challenges,” he said:\n\nIf you believe that maintaining power and control and absolute freedom of\nmovement and sovereignty is important to your country’s future, there’s\nnothing inconsistent in that [the US continuing to behaving unilaterally ].\n[The US is] the biggest, most powerful country in the world now. .. . But\nif you believe that we should be trying to create a world with rules and\npartnerships and habits of behavior that we would like to live in when\nwe're no longer the military political economic superpower in the world,\nthen you wouldn’t do that. It just depends on what you believe.\n\nLong before 2003, Clinton wanted to begin preparing Americans for this\nnew world. “Clinton believed [...] what we had in the wake of the cold\nwar was a multilateral moment — an opportunity to shape the world\nthrough our active leadership of the institutions Clinton admired and\n[Charles] Krauthammer disdained,” writes Strobe Talbott, former deputy\nsecretary of state in his book The Great Experiment: The Story of Ancient\nEmpires, Modern States, and the Quest for a Global Nation. “But Clinton\nkept that belief largely to himself while he was in office.... political\ninstincts told him it would be inviting trouble to suggest that the sun\nwould someday set on American preeminence.” Sadly, few Americans\nhave heeded Clinton’s wisdom. Few dare to mention that America could\nwell be number two. I discovered this when I chaired a panel on “the\nfuture of American power” at the 2012 World Economic Forum in Davos.\nAfter citing projections that America would have the second largest\neconomy in just a few years, I asked the American panelists — two\nsenators, a congresswoman and a former deputy national security advisor\n— whether Americans are ready to become number two. To my shock,\nnone could acknowledge publically this possibility.\n\nAmerica may well become number two faster than anyone has anticipated.\nAccording to the most recent International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nprojections, China will have larger share of global GDP than the United\nStates by 2017. In 1980, in PPP terms, the US share of the global economy\nwas 25 percent, while China’s was 2.2 percent. By 2017, the US share will\ndecline to 17.9 percent, and China’s will rise to 18.3 percent.
