  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nSeveral years after the argument, Griswold expressed a rather different view:\n\n“T have never seen any trace of a threat to national security from the publication. Indeed, I\nhave never seen it even suggested that there was such an actual threat. [He, of course,\nhad suggested just that in his oral argument]...It quickly becomes apparent to any person\nwho has considerable experience with classified material that there is massive\noverclassification and that the principal concern of the classifiers is not with national\nsecurity, but rather with governmental embarrassment of one sort or another. There may\nbe some basis for short-term classification while plans are being made, or negotiations are\ngoing on, but apart from details of weapons systems, there is very rarely any real risk to\ncurrent national security from the publication of facts relating to transactions in the past,\neven the fairly recent past. This is the lesson of the Pentagon Papers experience, and it\nmay be relevant now.”””\n\nThe First Amendment emerged victorious in the Pentagon Papers case, as it did in most of the anti-\nwar cases of the 1970s. But this was before the age of the internet. Everything would soon be\ndifferent as technology changed the sounds and sights of expression—as well as the stakes\ninvolved in the debate over disseminating massive amounts of classified material throughout the\nworld in the blink of an eye.\n\nJulian Assange and Wikileaks\n\nImportant as it was as a First Amendment precedent, the Pentagon Papers case was First\nAmendment “child play” compared with the Wikileaks case and other current threats to national\nsecurity posed by modern computer technology. The Pentagon Papers, after all, were to be\npublished by “mainstream,” “responsible”*’ and “patriotic” media, such as The New York Times,\nThe Washington Post and the Beacon Press, which would be “sensible” in what they exposed to\npublic view. They would never publish the names of spies, informers or other people whose lives\nmight be endangered by disclosure. (After all, they don’t even publish the names of alleged rape\nvictims, though there are good arguments for doing so, at least in some cases.)“*\n\n99 6¢\n\nMoreover, these “established” media have permanent “addresses.” They can be found and held\nlegally accountable if they violate the law. Moreover, they are “businesses” that need public\nsupport, and are therefore unlikely to take any actions that would alienate their paying readership\nand advertisers. These constraints provide some assurance that such established members of “the\nFourth Estate” will not pose the worst kind of dangers to our national security. They serve as an\ninformal “check and balance” on the excesses of journalistic freedom.”\n\nNone of these assurances or checks are in place when it comes to the “hackers,” “cyber-thieves,”\n“anarchist” and other “outsiders”—many of whom are “anonymous”—who currently threaten to\nexpose our deepest, most dangerous and most valuable “secrets.”\n\n” Washington Post, February 15, 1989.
