  "text": "Subject:\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella i,\nLeon,\n\nYesterday , | again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get\nflavor) and you and 1 will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other\nweeks spent doing the things that I don;t have the time to do.\n\nIn order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you,\n\nmight be helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500\nmillion dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments,\nin various categories ,a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range\nof all types of taxes. , planes. boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no\noversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants.\nconstruction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of Ilc's , including foreign, and with\nall that you only have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars.\n\nI have previously sent you the very same note that 1 have enclosed again below ,this time with\nhighlights . I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to\nhave been raised as one of your concerns , as aruleI try to memorialize things in writing in an\nattempt to lay out issues that I fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what 1 would and wouldn't\ndo , - my responsibilities. ete and those things that are not. below you will find details of things that I\nthought needed to be done, so that you wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently\nfind yourself. however ,you chose to defer many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago.\n! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50\n40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning that you needed to do something re personnel if it\nwere to stabilize,- you chose to wait.\n\nONE YEAR AGO\nFeb 17 2014 1 wrote:\n\nWith regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very\nstrong inclination is not to be involved at all . It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with\nmany pitfall many that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago\nthat the quality of the people involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way\nbefore the beginning of my involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship\nobligations of ok, -given all the complexities who else can do it? problem.\n\nYour family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around , sniping ,\nnitpicking with little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take\ncharge Everyone would report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not,\nby a long shot my first choice as I prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own\npersonal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmitted to reflect status stated by others )\n\nWith no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as Ihave failed in my attempt in\ntrying to think through the problem creatively . My organizations handling of the more complex\nissues I believe you might find very costly, very ! (however many structures available some risk\nsharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should\nbe only a trust, grat administrator. not sure what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to\noversee investments. whether Rich your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a\nnew person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person.\nThe increasing public profile needs to be taken into consideration.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023209",
