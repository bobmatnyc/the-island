  "text": "our follow up telephone conversation after the meeting, a plea to two federal misdemeanors was\nnever extended or meant as an offer.\n\nWe also would reiterate that the agreement to Section 2255 liability applies to all of the minor\ngirls identified during the federal investigation, not just the 12 that form the basis of an initial\nplanned charging instrument.\n\nAs you know, the ability to engage in flexible plea negotiations is dramatically changed upon the\nreturn of an indictment. Once an indictment is returned, the Office does not intend to file a\nSuperseding Information containing a lesser charge or to dismiss the case in favor of state\nprosecution.\n\nPlease let us know your client’s decision by no later than August 17. I have conferred with U.S.\nAttorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of incarceration is a\nnon-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time, he is not inclined to\nmeet with counsel for Mr. Epstein.\n\nSincerely,\n\nR. Alexander Acosta\nUnited States Attorney\n\nBy:\nMatthew Menchel —\nChief, Criminal Division\n\ncc: Roy Black\n\nGerald Lefcourt\n\nR. Alexander Acosta\nJeffrey Sloman\nAndrew Lourie\n\nA.
