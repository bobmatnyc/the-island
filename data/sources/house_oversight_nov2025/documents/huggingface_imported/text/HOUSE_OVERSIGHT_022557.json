Similar\nthe prosecution of others. to SEC’s treatment of cooperating individuals, credit\nfor cooperation by companies may range from taking no\n\nCivil Cases enforcement action to pursuing reduced sanctions in con-\n\nSEC’s Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by\nCompanies\n\nSEC’s framework for evaluating cooperation by com-\npanies is set forth in its 2001 Report of Investigation Pursuant\nto Section 21 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and\nCommission Statement on the Relationship of Cooperation to\nAgency Enforcement Decisions, which is commonly known\nas the Seaboard Report.”* The report, which explained the\nCommission’s decision not to take enforcement action\nagainst a public company for certain accounting violations\ncaused by its subsidiary, details the many factors SEC consid-\ners in determining whether, and to what extent, it grants leni-\nency to companies for cooperating in its investigations and\nfor related good corporate citizenship. Specifically, the report\nidentifies four broad measures of a company’s cooperation:\n\ne self-policing prior to the discovery of the miscon-\nduct, including establishing effective compliance\nprocedures and an appropriate tone at the top;\n\ne self-reporting of misconduct when it is discovered,\nincluding conducting a thorough review of the\nnature, extent, origins, and consequences of the mis-\nconduct, and promptly, completely, and effectively\ndisclosing the misconduct to the public, to regula-\ntory agencies, and to self regulatory organizations;\n\ne remediation, including dismissing or appropriately\ndisciplining wrongdoers, modifying and improv-\ning internal controls and procedures to prevent\nrecurrence of the misconduct, and appropriately\ncompensating those adversely affected; and\n\n* cooperation with law enforcement authorities,\nincluding providing SEC staff with all informa-\ntion relevant to the underlying violations and the\ncompany’s remedial efforts.\n\nSince every enforcement matter is different, this ana-\n\nlytical framework sets forth general principles but does not\n\n55\n\nnection with enforcement actions.\n\nSEC’s Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by\n\nIndividuals\n\nIn 2010, SEC announced a new cooperation program\n\nfor individuals.” SEC staff has a wide range of tools to\n\nfacilitate and reward cooperation by individuals, from tak-\n\ning no enforcement action to pursuing reduced sanctions in\n\nconnection with enforcement actions. Although the evalu-\n\nation of cooperation depends on the specific circumstances,\n\nSEC generally evaluates four factors to determine whether,\n\nto what extent, and in what manner to credit cooperation\n\nby individuals:\n\nthe assistance provided by the cooperating indi-\nvidual in SEC’s investigation or related enforce-\nment actions, including, among other things: the\nvalue and timeliness of the cooperation, including\nwhether the individual was the first to report the\nmisconduct to SEC or to offer his or her coopera-\ntion; whether the investigation was initiated based\nupon the information or other cooperation by the\nindividual; the quality of the cooperation, includ-\ning whether the individual was truthful and the\ncooperation was complete; the time and resources\nconserved as a result of the individual's coopera-\ntion; and the nature of the cooperation, such as the\ntype of assistance provided;\n\nthe importance of the matter in which the indi-\nvidual provided cooperation;\n\nthe societal interest in ensuring that the cooperat-\ning individual is held accountable for his or her\nmisconduct, including the severity of the individ-\nual’s misconduct, the culpability of the individual,\nand the efforts undertaken by the individual to\n\nremediate the harm; and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022557",
