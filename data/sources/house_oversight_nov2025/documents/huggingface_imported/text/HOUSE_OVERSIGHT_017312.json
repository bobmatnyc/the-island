We knew each other, though not well, and he had consulted with me regarding several\nissues, including the one that may have led to his death.\n\nEight days before Rabin was killed, Israel’s Ambassador to the United States had asked me to\nmeet with Prime Minister Rabin, when he was scheduled to speak in Boston later that month. I\nasked the Ambassador what the subject of the meeting would be, and he told me that the Prime\nMinister was deeply concerned about the increasingly virulent level of rhetoric in Israel and the\nfact that certain fringe religious and political figures were advocating violence against government\nofficials. He wanted to discuss whether there were ways of constraining the level of vitriol\nwithout infringing on the right of free speech.\n\nI agreed to meet with Rabin and wrote the appointment in my calendar. The meeting was not to\nbe. Rabin was murdered a week before his scheduled trip to Boston. I could never erase the\nscheduled meeting from my appointment book.\n\nI declined the offer to represent Amir, and watched with interest as his lawyers tried to present\nthe “rodef’ defense to an appropriately unsympathetic judge. Amir was convicted and sentenced\nto life in prison. He was married while in prison and allowed conjugal visits, during which he\nfathered a child.\n\nOther murder clients I rejected included Radovin Karadic, the head of Bosnian Serbs during the\nterrible ethnic wars in the former Yugoslavia. Karadic first called me while he was still a fugitive\nand while the killings were still ongoing and asked me to represent him. I told him of my policy\nof not representing fugitives or people involved in ongoing crimes. He asked if he could call me\nagain if the circumstances changed. I did not say no.\n\nShortly after receiving this call, I had occasion to be at a dinner with then President Clinton and\nFirst Lady Hillary Clinton. My decision to turn down Karadic had been reported in the press (he\nor someone close to him disclosed it) and it became the subject of discussion. Mrs. Clinton was\nadamantly against my representation of this “butcher,” but President Clinton said that if I could\npersuade him to turn himself into the international tribunal in the Hague as a condition of my\nrepresenting him, it would be a worthwhile tradeoff. Karadic did not turn himself in, and when he\nwas finally caught many years later, he asked me to meet with him in his prison cell in the Hague.\nI met with him just days after his capture and we discussed his case, as well as the cases of several\nof his former colleagues (one of which I was involved in). In the end, I did not represent him. He\nis still on trial in the Hague.\n\nDuring the “Arab Spring” of 2011, I received calls from individuals representing both deposed\nPresident Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and then fugitive leader of Lybia, Muammar Gaddafi, both of\nwhom were being accused of killing innocent civilians.\n\nA Norweigan human rights activist who was close to Mubarak asked me if I would be willing to\n\ngo to Cairo as part of the Mubarak legal team. I raised the question of whether it would be wise\nfor Mubarek to be represented by a Zionist Jew. He said that I would be part of a team of three\n\n229\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017312",
