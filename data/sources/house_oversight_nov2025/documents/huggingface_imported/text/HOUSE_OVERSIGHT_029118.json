I went through the candidates in math. . we should talk , I have great hopes for this and am\nsure you woud! want to get it right though some of the math people write well , their speakinn style and\npresence is less than A , and probaby closertoaC+/ . Im around today or hte weekend if you would like\nto chat.\n\nOn Fri, Dec 29, 2017 at 1:45 AM, Robert Kuhn ez wrote:\n‘Blahblahs’ forbidden in \"Radical Breakthroughs’. So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science\n\nand Rare Sentience).\nInitial ideas:\n\n* Expand the first episode “Mathematics and Truth” into two or likely three episodes. I’m intrigued by this\nbecause there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner’s\n‘unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)’, astrophysics, cosmology, biology, general\nsystems theory. I’ve felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three episodes\ncould work - if you agree, I’ll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts. Also, Closer\nTo Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 episodes!), so\n\nthis would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the series.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029118",
