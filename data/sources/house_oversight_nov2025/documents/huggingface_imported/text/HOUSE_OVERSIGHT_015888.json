  "text": "The Game of Math\n\nne of my most vivid childhood memories is driving my mother\n() distraction by asking the ‘why’ question. Most children go\nthrough this phase:\n\nMe: “Why is a sponge wet?”\n\nMy mother: “Because it has soaked up water.”\n\nMe: “Why has it soaked up water?”\n\nMy mother: “Because it has small holes in it”\n\nMe: “But what makes water wet?”\n\nMy mother: “Because it is made of wet stuff” a bit weak now.\n\nMe: “What is wet stuff?”\n\nYou can ramble on indefinitely unpeeling a never-ending onion.\nSometimes, if you are unlucky, you may get stuck in a loop. For example,\n“where did the chicken come from?” “An egg, “and where did the egg\ncome from?”..\n\nMathematics breaks this cycle!\n\nIn mathematics, there is no danger of an infinite number of ‘why’\nquestions because at its core are a clearly defined set of absolute rules\ncalled axioms. You cannot ask the ‘why’ question of an axiom. It is a\nRULE!\n\nStarting from an absolute minimum of fundamental rules\neverything else is built up so that no step requires any leap of faith nor\ngenerates any contradiction. Let me give you a concrete example and, in\nthe process, show you how numbers are defined.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015888",
