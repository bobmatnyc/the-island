By consulting personnel\nrecords, one would further discover that he did not actually work for\nthe State Department. Because it was no secret that the U.S. mission\nin Geneva housed the CIA station for all of Switzerland, any out-\nsider would think it probable that this brittle gambler who played\nthe options market worked for the CIA.\n\nEven though it cannot be precluded that Snowden was spotted\nin Geneva by another intelligence service, there is no evidence, at\nleast that I know of, to suggest that he was approached by one. Nor\nis there reason to believe that if he had been contacted by a for-\neign service in 2008, he would have responded positively. Despite\nhis indiscreet posting about his outside activities, he apparently still\nrespected the boundaries of secrecy that had been clearly defined in\nthe oath he had taken at the CIA. For example, after The New York\nTimes published an article revealing secret American intelligence\nactivities in Iran on January 11, 2009, Snowden railed against the\nnewspaper on the Internet under his TrueHooHa alias. He wrote,\n\n© “This shit is classified for a reason.... It’s because this shit won't ®\nwork if Iran knows what we are doing.” He clearly recognized that\nrevealing intelligence sources was extremely damaging. As for the\nTimes, he said, “Hopefully they’Il finally go bankrupt this year.”\nWhen another Internet user asked him if it was unethical to release\nnational security secrets, he answered, “ YEEEEEEEEEES.”\n\nAs with every CIA officer, Snowden had to undergo a two-year\nevaluation and take a routine polygraph test. It was then, in Decem-\nber 2008, that his superior at the CIA placed a “derog” in his file, the\nCIA’s shorthand for a derogatory comment, in an unfavorable evalu-\nation. The reason remains somewhat murky. According to a New\nYork Times story by the veteran intelligence reporter Eric Schmitt,\nSnowden’s superior had suspected that Snowden “was trying to\nbreak into classified computer files to which he was not authorized\nto have access.” Schmitt evidently had well-placed sources in the\nCIA. He said that he interviewed two senior American officials who\nwere familiar with the case. According to what they told Schmitt, the\nCIA superior had decided to “send Snowden home.” Officially, how-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 25 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019513",
