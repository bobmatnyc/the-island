  "text": "BHSEC has its roots in the college system. In June 2001, The New York City Board of Education\nand Bard College jointly created Bard High School Early College (BHSEC), with the support of\nthe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Since the 1960’s Bard College, originally called, Bard\nCollege of Simon’s Rock, was the nation’s only four year college and was specifically designed\n\nfor younger scholars.\n\n“Competition is tough,” Jeffrey Epstein notes, whose foundation actively supports public\neducation across the country. “Approximately 7,000 applicants compete for 150 seats each fall.\n\nSo we need to continue working with state education boards to duplicate this successful model.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026566",
