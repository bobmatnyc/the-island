Given their important\nportfolio hedging characteristics, municipal bonds\nshould remain the bedrock of the “sleep-well”\nportion of a US-based client’s portfolio.\n\nThe same can be said for high yield municipal\nbonds. Despite their almost 10-year duration, these\nbonds currently offer attractive spreads of close to\n3%, a level that has been higher only 29% of the\ntime since 2000. This spread provides a substantial\nbuffer that could partially offset higher Treasury\nyields, enabling the high yield municipal market\nto deliver positive returns of around 4% in our\nbase case. Therefore, we recommend clients stay\ninvested at their customized strategic weight.\n\nUS Corporate High Yield Credit\n\nEven for the bullish among us, last year’s\n\n17% total return in corporate high yield was\nsurprisingly strong.

What makes this performance even more\nimpressive is that high yield was down about 5%\nat its worst point in early 2016.\n\nBut these sizable gains have come at a cost.\nSpreads—which compensate investors for the risk\nof default losses—now stand well below their long-\nterm average. In fact, the level of spreads has been\nlower only a third of the time in the last 30 years.\nMoreover, yields have fallen from above 10%\nearly last year to less than 7% now, diminishing\nthe allure of these bonds to investors searching for\nhigh returns.\n\nEven so, we think the strong fundamentals\nunderpinning the asset class still warrant an\noverweight, though returns are almost certain to\nbe more modest going forward. At the heart of\nthis stance is our benign view on default losses,\nwhich are the primary risk to high yield investors.\nHere, several factors support our below-historical-\naverage 2.5% par-weighted default\nforecast for 2017.\n\nFirst, high yield firms stand to benefit\ndirectly from the strengthening US\neconomy we expect this year, considering\nalmost three-quarters of their sales\noriginate domestically.’** Second, leading\nindicators of defaults—such as Moody’s\nliquidity and covenant stress indexes—\nare trending downward, suggesting\nfewer speculative-grade companies are\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 69\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014602",
