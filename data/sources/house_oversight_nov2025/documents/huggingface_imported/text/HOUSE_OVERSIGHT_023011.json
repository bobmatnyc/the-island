  "text": "with obstruction of justice and sentenced to federal prison. He dies in 2015. The\ncontents of the black book become public as part of several civil lawsuits.\n\n2010\n\nApril: Flight logs obtained as part of civil lawsuits against Epstein show an\nassortment of politicians, academics, celebrities, heads of state and world leaders\nflying on Epstein’s jets in the early 2000s. Among them: former President Bill\nClinton, former national security adviser Sandy Berger, former Colombian President\nAndrés Pastrana and lawyer Alan Dershowitz.\n\n2011\n\nMarch: Two of Epstein’s victims file a motion in federal court accusing the\ngovernment of violating their rights by failing to notify them about the plea deal and\nkeeping it secret. Among other things, they want the plea deal invalidated in the\nhopes of sending Epstein to prison. They accuse federal prosecutors of deceiving\nthem with “false notification letters.”\n\nSeptember: U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra rejects the U.S. Attorney’s Office\nargument that it was under no obligation to notify victims prior to striking a non-\nprosecution agreement with Epstein because there were no federal charges filed\nagainst him. The decision marks a victory for Epstein’s victims, but the case will\ndrag on for seven more years.\n\nNovember: Epstein must register in New York as the highest and most dangerous\nlevel of sex offender, despite efforts by him and the New York District Attorney’s\noffice to lower the classification. A Level 3 status means “high risk of repeat offense\nand a threat to public safety exists,” according to the state’s guidelines.\n\n2012\n\nMarch-December: Calling himself a “celebrated philanthropist” and a “renowned\neducational investor,” Epstein undertakes a public relations campaign to counter\nbad press about his sexual exploits. His foundation donates millions to scientific\nresearch and sponsors global conferences on ways to achieve world peace and save\nthe planet. He funds cancer and educational research projects around the country.\n\n2015\n\nVirginia Roberts was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited to be a\nmasseuse to Palm Beach hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein. She was lured into a\nlife of depravity and sexual abuse.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023011",
