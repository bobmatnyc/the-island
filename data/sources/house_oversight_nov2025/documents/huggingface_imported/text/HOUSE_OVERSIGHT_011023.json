  "text": "... But unlike the wonderful “one-hoss shay,” the productive life of educational\ncapital typically does not go to pieces all at once. It depreciates along the way, it\nbecomes obsolete, it is altered by changes in retirement and by the state of\nemployment ...\n\n... As already noted, educational capital, like reproducible physical capital, is subject\nto depreciation and obsolescence. The established tax treatment takes account of\nboth depreciation and obsolescence in the case of physical capital, but this\naccounting is not extended to education capital... In brief, our tax laws... appear to\nbe all but blind to the fact that educational capital entrails maintenance and\ndepreciation, becomes obsolete, and disappears at death...\n\nThese excerpts clearly show Shultz’ meanings of pure and invested consumption,\nand of human deprecation. He says “pure investment” in place of my “invested\nconsumption”, but I prefer to follow tradition by applying “invested” to physical\ncapital alone. We also see his belief, with which | disagree, that substantial invested\nconsumption continues after independence and physical maturity. For example, he\nwrites “Direct expenditures on ... health and internal migration ... are clear\nexamples.” I interpret these outlays, when applied to adult workers, as maintenance\nconsumption preserving rather than adding skills, and enabling current pay rather\n\nthan invested for higher pay later.\n\n| agree that self-invested work “to improve skills and knowledge ... accounts for\nmost of the impressive rise in the real earnings per worker ...”. But | don’t share\nSchultz’ view that the “use of leisure time” accounts for much of this improvement.\nMy years in plants and oilfields and offices have given me an impression of some\nstudy by workers during leisure time, but mostly passive accumulation of\n\nexperience and insight while fully at work on the job.\n\nPractical Uses\n\nOne obvious use of the human capital idea is to compare the factors (human and\ntradeable capital) in the same dimension. Capital and labor cannot be added, as\n\nPetty knew, since capital is measured in dollars where labor is measured in dollars\n\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011023",
