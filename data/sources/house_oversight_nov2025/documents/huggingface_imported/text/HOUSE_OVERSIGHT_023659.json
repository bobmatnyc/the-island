  "text": "- You mean the media of “Muslim brotherhood”. The media criticizing Saudi Arabia or the Saudi-\nEgyptian relationship is the same criticizing President Sisi. The Saudi-Egyptian relationship has a\nstrong and solid relationship in the deepest roots of the relations between the countries that are\nnot affected in any way. In the history of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, they always stand with each\nother conditions and at all times. That situation did not change and there is no a situation of\nnegative attitude of the Egyptian government towards Saudi Arabia, and also, there is no a\nsituation of negative attitude of one of the Saudi government to the Egyptian government. Egypt\nhas not been delayed for a moment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia will not be\ndelayed for a moment to Egypt. This is a strong conviction between the leaders of the two\ncountries, but also between the people of both countries. Without a doubt, the enemies of Saudi\nArabia and Egypt will try to create rumors in one form or another, whether from Iranian\npropaganda or the media of “Muslim brotherhood” propaganda to cause a rift in the Saudi-\nEgyptian relationship, and the leadership of the two countries does not pay attention to these\npolemics and trivialities.\n\n* Your Highness has mentioned the subject of King Salman Bridge between the Kingdom and Egypt. Do\nYour Highness bet on it?\n\n- That is true, the working relevant teams have started working in the offices, not in front of the media\nthe bridge after the bridge has been approved. The results will be announced when laying the\nfoundation stone with full details, and the time of laying the foundation stone before 2020 without a\ndoubt.\n\n* The islands. Have you finished the subject of islands?\n- There were no problems with the islands originally.\n* We heard the Egyptian media speaks about the subject that within the corridors of the courts?\n\n- which occurred about a year ago is only a delimitation of the maritime boundaries. The islands are\nregistered with Egypt as a Saudi islands and they are registered with Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as Saudi\nislands. And are also, registered in the international centers as Saudi islands. Only the demarcation of\nthe maritime borders has been done. Both Egypt and Saudi Arabia has not relinquished any part of their\nterritories. The demarcation of the border came for reasons of economic benefits that could be created\nafter the demarcation of these borders, especially the King Salman Bridge, oil supply, gas supplies,\npower supply or train and roads that will target the port in North Sinai, and the exports of Gulf countries\nto Europe.\n\n* |s it possible to see in the future a direct dialogue with Iran, despite what it is doing in the region?\n\n- How to reach an understanding with one who has the regime is firmly convinced that his system is\nbased on the ideology of extremism enshrined in the Constitution and stipulated in the command of\nKhomeini that he must control the Muslims of the Islamic world and the dissemination of the doctrine of\nJaafari-Ethna Ashry ethnic of them throughout the Islamic world until the Mahdi appears. How can |\nconvince this person? What are the interests between me and him? When | have a problem with\nanother state, we start to solve it. For example, if there is an economic problem there is a continuation\nof what you want and what we want and how we understand it. Or a political problem, for example with\nRussia how to cooperate in Syria. What are your interests and what are mine. How do we cooperate in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023659",
