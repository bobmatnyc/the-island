  "text": "many decades, stemmed from their desire to protect their own private\ninterests—even at the expense of the state.\n\nCould reform efforts have taken a different course in Jordan? In a\ncountry where the king has broad powers over all branches of\ngovernment, his expressed frustration over the struggling reform\nefforts begs the question of why the status quo remains intact. This\ndecade-long process, initiated by the king, has been largely ignored\nby an ossified layer of elites seeking to protect their own interests.\nThe clear discrepancy between the king’s directives to the seven\nprime ministers he had entrusted to form governments in his twelve\nyears of power—and the actual record of reform completed by these\nrespective governments—points to a structural problem that is all too\noften ignored.\n\nMuch research has been done on the creation of rentier and semi-\nrentier systems in the Arab world, whereby the state relies on rents\nfrom such nonproductive sources as oil or external assistance. Such\nrents, however, are also specifically utilized to provide privileges to\nthe political elite in exchange for its loyalty. These groups, developed\nby many Arab systems over decades, support the existing order\nbecause it occupies a privileged position that would be compromised\nby merit-based systems, rather than ones based on clientelism and\npatronage.\n\nIn the case of Jordan, this group has become so entrenched, powerful,\nand ossified that it is now not only resisting such reform from below\nbut—more dangerously—from above. In other words, these elites\nhave become recalcitrant, self-appointed guardians of the state who\nbelieve they alone should decide how the country ought to evolve.\nThey have no qualms about opposing the directives of the leaders or\nsystems that created them in the first place if those leaders are seen as\nadopting policies that threaten their interests.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030068",
