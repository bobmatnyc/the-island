  "text": "the attorneys went to outside counsel Kendall Coffey, and asked whether or not they\ncould buy the book for the $50,000 that the houseman had asked for it. THREE\nmonths later, the FBI and the same AUSA that had headed my prosecution set up my\nhouseman in a sting. It appears that while using a lawyer from the RRA firm, Brad\nEdwards, as a confidential informant for the government at the same time that Scott\nRothstein was using me and the allegations against me to fleece his victims, the US\nattorneys’ office was sitting in the Rothstein offices planning a sting operation, while\nright next door, Scott Rothstein was making off to Morocco in an attempt to flee the\ncountry. Alfredo Rodriguez was prosecuted by the same AUSA and received an 18-\nmonth sentence; however, it also appeared that on the very same day of his sting\narrest, he bought an illegal gun, and was later sentenced to four years in prison.\nWho Cara Holmes is, and what her role was in RRA is still a mystery to us. She\nappears to be a former FBI agent out of the Chicago office. She joined the Rothstein\nfirm in May of 2009, and joined the Florida Bar at the same time. She attended\ndepositions of my pilots and my houseman. She communicated regularly with Brad\nEdwards and the investigators on my case. The email traffic is extensive.\n\nThe telephone book that sy Rodriguez had stolen from my house was then\nturned over(by the government?) to the same attorneys who had been told they\ncould not buy it as s they would have been buying stolen property. Brad Edwards, the\nformer partner of Scott Rothstein, then used the purloined book to send out letters\nto everyone in the book, asking for additional stories of my wrongdoing in the past\nfive years with the hopes of getting new clients. The letter was structured so as to\ncircumvent the ethical rules regarding trolling for clients.\n\nWhile I was serving my sentence, my lawyers were able to come see me in jail. Only\ntwo months after being incarcerated, my in house lawyer came to see me to tell me\nthat we were now conducting an audit of legal fees paid to date. They had\ndiscovered that Gerald Lefcourt, my primary attorney, had taken out cash to\nthe tune of $800,000, that according to his own accountant, he was not entitled to.\nHe had simply prepared invoices that said, “Please pay another $100,000 or\n$200,000”. Though he had been asked on multiple occasions to substantiate the\nbills, his response would be, “We are working full time for you”. I pointed out that\nhis was not the only firm working for me, but he replied, “Would you like me to\nquit?” He eventually returned over $400,000 over a period of time, as he said that\nhis cash flow could not handle the strain. He said that he was still owed for things\nlike taxi fair, coffee and doughnuts, detailed for $2.53, and would keep $400,000.\n\nI was told that I should hire Guy Lewis, a former US Attorney in the Southern\nDistrict. Lewis, a southern style gentleman; white suits, fast cars; said he had a great\nrelationship with the current US Attorney, Alex Acosta, and the people in\nWashington that would potentially need to review what ever happened in South\nFlorida. He wanted a $100,000 per month retainer, and with this, his partner Mike\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025544",
