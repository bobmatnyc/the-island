  "text": "with wit and arresting thought expertments—Dennett shows how culture enables reflection by installing a\nbounty of thinking tools, or memes, in our brains. Language, itself composed of memes, turbocharged this\ninterplay. The result, a mind that can comprehend the questions it poses, emerges from a process of cultural\nevolution.\n\nAn agenda-setting book for a new generation of philosophers and other researchers, From Bacteria to Bach and\nBack will delight and entertain anyone who hopes to understand human creativity in all its wondrous\napplications.\n\nDANIEL C. DENNETT is the author of Intuition Pumps, Breaking the Spell, Freedom Evolves, and\nConsciousness Explained. He is the University Professor and Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy, and\nco-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University.\n\n-o\n\nA CRACK IN CREATION\n\nGene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution\n\nBy Jennifer A. Doudna and Samuel H. Sternberg\n\n[US — Houghton Mifflin, UK — Bodley Head, China — Hunan Science, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub\nDate: June 2017; 320 pages]\n\nIn the tradition of The Double Helix, A Crack in Creation is an insider’s account of the biggest scientific\ndiscovery of our era: a cheap, easy way of rewriting genetic code, with nearly limitless promise and peril.\n\nNot since the atomic bomb has a technology so alarmed its inventors that they warned the world against its use.\nNot, that is, until the spring of 2015, when biologist Jennifer Doudna called for a worldwide moratorium on the\nuse of the new gene-editing tool CRISPR to make heritable changes in human embryos. The cheapest, simplest,\nmost effective way of manipulating DNA ever known, CRISPR may well give us the cure to HIV, genetic\ndiseases, and some cancers, and will help address the world’s hunger crisis. Yet even the tiniest changes to DNA\ncould have myriad, unforeseeable consequences—to say nothing of the ethical and societal repercussions of\nintentionally mutating embryos to create \"better\" humans.\n\nWriting with fellow researcher Samuel Sternberg, Doudna shares the thrilling story of her discovery, and\npassionately argues that enormous responsibility comes with the ability to rewrite the code of life. With\nCRISPR, she shows, we have effectively taken control of evolution. What will we do with this unfathomable\npower?\n\nJENNIFER A. DOUDNA 1s a professor in the Chemistry and the Molecular and Cell Biology Departments at\nthe University of California, Berkeley, investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and researcher in\nthe Physical Biosciences Division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She is internationally\nrecognized as a leading expert on RNA-protein structure and function, CRISPR biology, and genome\nengineering.\n\nSAMUEL H. STERNBERG received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2014, and has\nbeen a member of Jennifer Doudna’s laboratory since 2010. He was a lead researcher and author of numerous\nhigh-profile publications on the CRISPR technology. He has been awarded the RNA Society’s Scaringe Award\nand the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award, among other\nhonors.\n\nBrockman, Inc.
