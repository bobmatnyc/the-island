And finally, Turkey will extend full support to the families of\nthe Mavi Marmara victims in their pursuit of justice from Israel.\nSome of these sanctions could be considered radical; however, some\nof these same actions, although with some slight differences, have\nbeen taken before in Turkey's relationship with Israel.
