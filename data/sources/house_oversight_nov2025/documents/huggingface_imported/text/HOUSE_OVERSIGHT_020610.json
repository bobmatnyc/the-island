Rudd has argued that\nthis legislation would have mitigated some of the more problematic behaviors regarding foreign influence\nthat have since occurred. Others, however, maintain that the ban would not have stopped the bulk of\nCCP-backed donations, which are channeled through Australian residents and citizens, and that the more\nimportant reform was to ensure greater transparency in identifying foreign agents.

There are roughly\n\n160,000 PRC students in Canadian schools, about 70 percent of them in universities\nand colleges. Per capita, this is about three times as large as in the United States and\nroughly on par with Australia.\n\nCanadian experiences with Chinese interference are less intense than those documented\nin Australia and New Zealand.
