  "text": "deliver the honestly-earned confidence of the secure. They will provide purchase for\nthe patient work of diplomacy, a marked shift from the crisis-to-crisis lurching of\ntoday.\n\nThe texture of our values should be everywhere woven into these gatelands we will\ncultivate: Democratic choice, freedom of thought, privacy. We won't have time for\nleisurely deliberation about ideals in the crashing, time-compacted crises ahead, so\nwe should begin with them. Let other nations measure gated enclosures for their\ndifferent values, marked by their paranoias and historical burdens; our strength will\nbe an order that reflects our habits of civilization. The curious, open-minded\nsearching native to our temperament, for instance. This will force constant\ninnovation and evolution, an antidote to the failure to change that poisons most\nclosed systems. A continued absence of gates will undo us in the short run. But the\nlong run will be a disaster if our gates are inflexible, too closed, incapable of upgrade\nor —- worse - girded by promises and fears that are not naturally our own.\n\nA second principle is that we ought not force anyone else to use our gated systems.\nGatekeeper or gatekept? No more profound, painful, liberating or enslaving political\nchoice now exists. Nations must be free to select, in as much as they can, their own\nterms of enmeshment. Our aim should simply be to build the best order we can.\nAmerica’s tremendous economic and technical lead serves us - for now, at least - as\nthe isolating stretch of the Atlantic and Pacific once did. There’s no need to force\nothers to follow us. Recall Greshams’ famous “economic law”: The way in which the\nbad drives out the good. A stock market made of swindlers won’t attract investors\nfor very long. Well, in many networks, a sort of reverse-Gersham’s law applied. The\ngood drives out the bad. By this I don’t mean merely the self-cleaning properties of\nsystems like Wikipedia. But of linked systems more broadly. If one nation runs a\nDNA database where results are skewed by rules of political power - family\nmembers of leaders get special access for instance — it will make it less effective, and\ntherefore less appealing as a gateland. So we should be relaxed about letting Europe\nor Russia or China try their own gated systems. Their desires reflect sensible,\nunderstandable urges. If you were leading a nation would you rely on Washington’s\ntrade or financial commitments? Because of the nature of power now many nations\nmay have no other choice; but forcing them to enmeshment could bring shattering,\nunnecessary pressure. Let them divide themselves from us; it will only weaken\nthem.\n\nWe need not evangelize, invade, or compel our way to power. Consider the case of\nglobal trade. For decades after World War Two, many nations sought independence\nfrom economic entanglement. They yearned for autarky. They scorned trade. And\nthey nearly bankrupted themselves in the process: Want to buy Portuguese cars?\nFrench computers? Indian bikinis? | didn’t think so. The whole point of trade was to\nsolve such imbalances of skill and trade. When the age of connection began after the\nCold War, most countries made a decisive shift: They arranged their economies to\nbe attractive to global financial flows. Trade grew twice as fast as the world\neconomy. The cost of being left out was, and is, a nearly impossible burden.\nAmerican systems, if they work for America, should have the same magnetic appeal,\n\n174\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018406",
