Investors in structured investments assume the credit risk of the issuer or\nguarantor. If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity. Structured investments often perform differently from the asset(s) they\nreference. Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the structured investment or the reference asset. Each structured\ninvestment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you may be forced to own the reference asset at a depressed price; 2) limits on the ability to\nshare in upside appreciation; 3) the potential for increased losses if the reference asset declines; and 4) potential inability to sell given the lack of a public trading market.\n\n* Tactical Tilts. Tactical tilts may involve a high degree of risk. No assurance can be made that profits will be achieved or that substantial losses will not be incurred. Prior to investing, you must\ndetermine whether a particular tactical tilt is suitable for them.\n\n* U.S. Registered Mutual Funds / Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”) or Exchange Traded Notes (“ETNs”). You should consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses,\nand read the summary prospectus and/or the Prospectus (which may be obtained from your PWM Team) carefully before investing, as they contain this and other relevant information. You may\nobtain documents for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at http:/Avww.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your PWM team; or 3) calling toll-free at 1-866-471-2526. Unlike\ntraditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly redeemable by the fund. Leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs, or commodities futures-\nlinked ETFs may experience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver multiples of the\nperformance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis. Their performance over a longer period of time can vary significantly from the stated daily\nperformance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding. Performance differences may be magnified in a volatile market. ETFs are redeemable only in\nCreation Unit size aggregations and may not be individually redeemed; are redeemable only through Authorized Participants; and are redeemable on an \"in-kind\" basis. The public trading price of\na redeemable lot of the ETFs may be different from its net asset value. These ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value. There is always a fundamental risk of declining\nstock prices, which can cause losses to your investment. Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into\nand liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure (i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future prices for the underlying\ncommodity. ETFs and ETNs linked to commodity futures do not offer direct exposure to the commodity’s spot price and may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself.\nPerformance differential can be magnified if a specific condition persists in the market for a commodity that creates a disparity between near-term future prices and long-term future prices and\nmay lead to unexpected performance results. Other factors, such as roll yield, transaction costs, management fees, and taxes may cause deviation in performance between the spot price of a\ncommodity and commodity futures. You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio.\n\nSecurity-Specific References.
