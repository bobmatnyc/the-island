  "text": "14\n\nThere is another problem with realism. Like it or not, the United\nStates is a revolutionary power. Whether our government is trying to\noverthrow foreign dictators is almost irrelevant; American society is\nthe most revolutionary force on the planet. The Internet is more\nsubversive than the CIA in its prime. The dynamism of American\nsociety is constantly creating new businesses, new technologies, new\nideas and new social models. These innovations travel, and they\nmake trouble when they do. Saudi conservatives know that whatever\ngeopolitical arrangements the Saudi princes make with the American\ngovernment, the American people are busily undermining the core\nprinciples of Saudi society. It’s not just our NGOs educating Saudi\nwomen and civil society activists; it’s not just the impact of American\ncollege life on the rising generation of the Saudi elite. We change the\nworld even when we aren’t thinking anything about global revolution —\nwhen Hollywood and rap musicians are just trying to make a buck,\nthey are stoking the fires of change around the world.\n\nA revolutionary nation cannot make a conservative foreign policy\nwork for long. In the 1820s and 1830s Washington tried to reassure\nthe Mexican government that it had no hostile designs against\nMexican territory. But the American people were moving into Texas\nand the US government couldn’t stop that movement or blunt the\nthreat to Mexico if it tried. In the same way today, the economic and\npolitical activity of individual Americans and American companies is\nchanging the world in ways that make life much harder for\ngovernments in countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. We\ncan press all the reset buttons with Russia that we want, but the\nRussian government will still notice that both US society and\nsometimes the government are actively working to help foreign\nsubversives overthrow repressive regimes.\n\nFeckless Idealists\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031889",
