  "text": "see the the whole ox. Nowadays, | meet the ox with my mind and spirit rather than\nsee it.”4 The butcher was not looking at his work; he was feeling the energy of the\ntask. “A good cook goes through a knife in a year, because he cuts,” the butcher\nconcluded. “An average cook goes through a knife in a month, because he hacks. I\nhave used this knife for nineteen years. It has butchered thousands of oxen, But the\nblade is still like it's newly sharpened.” He was cutting not with his knife, but with an\ninstinct - and the result was the highest form of mastery: accomplishment with\nnearly no effort. This our our aim: To see the world with our mind, not our eyes. So\nmuch of what will affect us in the future is invisibly stashed on a connected\nlandscape we're only now learning to feel. It will emerge from the complex, adaptive\nsea of links expanding around us. We must tune our own instincts for this power,\nwhich will make our moves almost effortless. The ever-sharp mental knife laid upon\nthe thick challenges of a new age.\n\nThere will be moments ahead for all of us - the most dangerous or terrifying or\nwonderful ones - in which things will happen that none of our old ideas or senses\ncan help us understand. The truly new. We've had previews of such moments often\nenough in recent years: innovative devices, surprise attacks, unexpected and\npermanent economic quakes. A cracking of the old physics of wealth and power is\nunderway around us, largely invisible to most of us, except perhaps in its strange\nand unnatural effects: everywhere terror, instant billionaries, the failure of ideas\nand institutions, millions of migrants loosed and drifting across old borders, but\ntethered to deeper fields of connection, data, and ideology. The Seventh Sense is the\nability to see why this is happening. And to use what you see. This is not merely\nabout brain power or sharpened intellect; it’s about a gut reaction. Just as the\ndemand for liberty or industry was once invisible and insensible to an age\naccustomed hundreds of years ago to feudal, agricultural habits, so we're likely blind\nto urgent pressures of our own. Surely you've felt this creeping anxiety yourself, the\nexciting nausea of movement coming from you know not where? The ability to sense\nand feel the deeper chord changes of history has, always, been the decisive mark of\nleadership and success in revolutionary periods.\n\nConsider, for instance, Charles, the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel who faced\ndown Napoleon on the fields of Jena in what is now central Germany in October\n1806. Brusnwick-Wolfenbuttel was then 71 years old. He was considered one of the\nmost courageous soldiers of his age, with a record of astonishing victories. He\nlooked over the sun-dappled fields along the Saar river on that fall day and saw\nnearly certain victory in the coming battle. He had Napoleon outmatched two\nsoldiers to one. His men were masters of the subtle techniques of Frederick the\nGreat, tactics that had delivered victory in far more perilous moments. But\nNapoleon, less than half the Duke’s age at 37, stared across the same undulating\nland, the same poised armies and saw in the landscape something completely\n\n4 When I started butchering: I’ve finessed the always-unstranslatable Zhuangzi.\nSee for reference Burton Watson, Burton, The Complete Works of Chuang Tzu.
