  "text": "142 Teaching Minds\n\nYoung woman: Good judgment.\n\nInterviewer: Any specifics?\n\nYoung woman: I think she would control the out-of-control\nspending.\n\nYoung woman: I think she would acknowledge the system of\ngovernment in the United States rather than focus on the\nadministration of czars.\n\nInterviewer: Yeah, and what is your problem with czars?\n\nYoung woman: I’m an American and we don’t have czars in\nAmerica.\n\nHere again, we have a juxtaposition of beliefs based on no actual evi-\ndence or reality. I don’t know what this woman has heard about czars,\nbut whatever it is, it misses the point. Could we teach this woman to\nbe on point—to say meaningful things based on actual evidence? Not\nnow, I fear, but it is my contention that we could have done so at some\npoint in her life. School has failed her and she seems, to anyone listen-\ning, to be stupid. But she is not really stupid; she is just talking stu-\npidly because she hasn’t been challenged to behave in any other way.\nHere is another:\n\nMiddle-aged woman: Governor of Alaska is the only one that has\ntop security.\n\nInterviewer: What does that mean?\n\nMiddle-aged woman: It means that if anything happens to our\nborders on that side, she’s the first one in line for attack for\nthere.\n\nThis person not only makes no sense, but she can’t speak in an under-\nstandable way. Is that genetic? I doubt it. Intelligence, as it is popularly\ndefined, includes the ability to produce coherent speech, which cer-\ntainly can be enhanced through teaching, but apparently not by our\nschools as they currently exist.\n\nHere is one last interview from that event:\n\nInterviewer: What do you think of foreign policy—what would\nyou like to see her do with foreign policy?\n\nMan with cap: I don’t know, I really don’t have an answer—I\ndon’t know her well enough. I don’t know what she knows or\ndoesn’t know. I don’t know some stuff of what people ask me.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023888",
