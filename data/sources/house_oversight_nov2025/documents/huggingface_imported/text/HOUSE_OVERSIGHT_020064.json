  "text": "after a long and bitter internal debate, the president announced that he had decided to\nwithdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. For Bannon, it was a deeply satisfying slap\nin the face of liberal rectitude—Elon Musk and Bob Iger immediately resigned from\nTrump’s business council—and confirmation of Trump’s true Bannonite instincts.\n\nIt was, likewise, the move that Ivanka Trump had campaigned hardest against in the\nWhite House.\n\n“Score,” said Bannon. “The bitch 1s dead.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nThere are few modern political variables more disruptive than a dedicated prosecutor. It’s\nthe ultimate wild card.\n\nA prosecutor means that the issue under investigation—or, invariably, cascading issues\n—will be a constant media focus. Setting their own public stage, prosecutors are certain\nleakers.\n\nIt means that everybody in a widening circle has to hire a lawyer.

More\nto the point: you must not under any circumstances speak to Jared and Ivanka, who were\nnow Russia toxic. It was Bannon’s widely advertised virtue and advantage: “I’ve never\nbeen to Russia. I don’t know anybody from Russia. I’ve never spoken to any Russians.\nAnd I'd just as well not speak to anyone who has.”\n\nBannon observed a hapless Pence in a lot of “wrong meetings,” and helped to bring in\nthe Republican operative Nick Ayers as Pence’s chief of staff, and to get “our fallback\nguy” out of the White House and “running around the world and looking like a vice\npresident.”\n\nAnd beyond the immediate fears and disruption, there was the virtually certain\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020064",
