  "text": "There has been some looting and other lawlessness in some areas. Local law enforcement is now\nsupported by resources from our federal and state governments. Our on-site team reports that we have\nbeen spared that threat. In addition to our own Loss Prevention staff, our Management Company has\nhired an independent security team to help protect our property.\n\nOne of the most important questions we must address is just when our Club might open again. The\nClub is closed through October 7 and Member Services is not presently taking any reservations through\nDecember 17. There is a strong possibility that our re-start date could hinge on when the rest of St.\nThomas recovers, and it is simply impossible to predict that date at this time. Your Board and the\nManagement team are monitoring this closely and we will keep you apprised.\n\nAnd finally, we thank all who have contributed to the GBCOA Employee Relief Fund. Our Ladies\n\nand Gentlemen are in desperate need of your help. They deeply appreciate whatever you may offer to\nhelp, as does the Board. Thank you!\n\nGREAT BAY CONDOMINIUM OWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC.\n\n6910 GREAT BAY; ST.
