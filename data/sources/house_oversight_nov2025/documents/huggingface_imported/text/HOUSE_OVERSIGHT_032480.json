In any case there will be\nneed for some work on my side before final filing is done.\n\nOn the other hand, if there is a \"checks and balances\" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers\n(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent.\n\nPlease do let me know.\n\nWe can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032480",
