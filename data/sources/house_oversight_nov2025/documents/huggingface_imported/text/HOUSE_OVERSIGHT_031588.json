  "text": "practice of foreign policy, and as such is antithetical to Western ideals,\nwhich raises questions, misunderstandings, and fears among the Western\npowers as China emerges a major world power. The notion of peaceful\ndevelopment is also important, and is central to Xi Jinping’s\nadministration. This concept means that China seeks peaceful relations\nwith other members of the international community to establish fruitful\neconomic relations that will serve Chinese development goals. To achieve\nthis goal, China needs a stable environment. The concept of peaceful\ndevelopment means, according to Xi Jinping, that “China will never seek\nhegemony or expansion.”\n\nAlthough Western powers may not approve of the “Chinese Model,” it\ndoes explain Chinese policy on the Syrian crisis.\n\nIt is also worth noting the influence of China’s domestic situation on\nChinese policy in Syria. Beying cannot legitimize any insurrection abroad,\nas it has to deal domestically with separatist issues (such as in Tibet,\nXinjiang, or Inner Mongolia.). To show that domestic considerations can\nlogically obliterate considerations of human rights, George Abu Ahmad,\ntaking domestic policies of Iran, Russia or China as an example, explains\nthat “the exceptional decision to attack the population is, therefore, not\nonly a sovereign right of the twentieth-century state, but the paramount\nright that guarantees a state’s integrity.” This perspective helps us to\nunderstand the way in which China may have internalized the causes of\nthe Syrian crisis in the context of its own domestic separatist issues and\nthus cannot provide any legitimacy to an insurrection abroad.\n\nA final point to make is China’s inability and unwillingness to take on a\n“superpower” role within the international community. China has no\nexperience being a political leader on the international stage, and as a\nresult has mostly abstained in the Security Council on any draft resolution\nthat did not directly affect its own domestic situation. Nor does it like to\ntake any strong stances that could lead to diplomatic clashes with a major\npower, especially the U.S. It seems improbable, given the record of\nChinese positions in the UN, that China would have opposed the Western\nresolutions on Syria without the support of Russia.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031588",
