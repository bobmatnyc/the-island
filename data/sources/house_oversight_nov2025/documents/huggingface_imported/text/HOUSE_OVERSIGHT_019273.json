  "text": "Freedom House\n\nto economic mismanagement and political dishones-\nty. It was devastated by the 2010 election results, and\nhas failed to reemerge as a viable opposition entity. In\nPoland, the center-right Civic Platform had been the\ndominant force until the 2015 PiS victory. It achieved\neconomic success and gained respect in Brussels,\nbut lost the support of the working class, the provinc-\nes, and all those who felt bypassed by globalization.\nSimilarly, the elitist secular parties that had ruled\nTurkey for most of the 20th century were swept aside\nby Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development\nParty, which appealed to a rising Islamist middle class.\nAnd in Venezuela, it took only a few years in power\nfor Hugo Chavez to win over the country’s poor and\nmarginalize the conservative mainstream parties that\nhad led the country for decades.\n\nA second precondition for the emergence of illiberal re-\ngimes is a fundamental weakness in democratic institu-\ntions beyond the political sphere, including the media,\ncivil society, anticorruption agencies, and the judiciary.\nIn many newer democracies, these checks and balanc-\n\nes remain fragile: It is widely assumed that whoever\ncontrols the parliament will also come to dominate the\njudiciary and the security services, and the media are\nvulnerable to intimidation or partisan capture.\n\nlliberalism seems less likely to gain traction in the\nUnited States because the courts, for example, are\nproudly independent, and freedom of the press is firm-\nly protected by statute and constitutional jurispru-\ndence. But if illiberal forces have sufficient political\nwill and the defenders of democratic institutions lack\nconviction and public support, anything is possible.\nPolls have shown that popular faith in Congress and\nthe Supreme Court are at historic lows. A growing\nnumber of Americans question the effectiveness of\nrepresentative democracy and ask whether it would\nbe better to let the president make decisions unen-\ncumbered by the legislative branch. An astonishing\none in six Americans believe it would be acceptable\nto have the army rule. And with each passing genera-\ntion, a smaller share of U.S. citizens believe that living\nunder a democracy is important.’\n\n1. “Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Speech at the 25th Balvanyos Summer Free University and Student Camp,” Website of the Hungari-\nan Government, July 26, 2014, http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/the-prime-minister-s-s peeches/prime-minister-vik-\ntor-orban-s-speech-at-the-25th-balvanyos-summer-free-university-and-student-camp.\n\n2. “Speech by Prime Minister Viktor Orban on 15 March,” Website of the Hungarian Government, March 16, 2016, http://www.korma-\nny. hu/en/the-prime-minister/the-prime-minister-s-speeches/speech-by-prime-minister-viktor-orban-on-15-march.\n\n3.
