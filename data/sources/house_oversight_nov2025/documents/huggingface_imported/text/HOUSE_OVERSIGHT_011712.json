  "text": "Chapter Fifteen\n\nOn the morning of April 1, 1991. I got up even earlier than usual, to visit the\ngraves of the men who had lost their lives in my battalion in the Yom Kippur\nWar. I also went to pay my respects to Uzi Yairi, killed when he’d rushed from\nhis desk in the kiryva to join the Sayeret Matkal attack at the Savoy Hotel. Then\nNava and I drove to Jerusalem. At Israel’s national military cemetery on Mount\nHerzl, we stood before the resting place of Nechemia Cohen, Yoni Netanyahu,\nDado, and Avraham Arnan. From there, we went to the Prime Minister’s office.\nWith Dan Shomron and his wife looking on, Shamir presented me with my third\nstar and formally made me chief of staff.\n\nFor years, I'd developed the habit of carrying around a notebook in which\nI’d jot down thoughts on things I thought that the Israeli military, and I as an\nofficer, could have done better: errors, oversights, and how we might fix them.\nIn the weeks before becoming ramatkal, I'd filled dozens of pages on issues\nlarge and small I hoped to address as the commander of the armed forces. A lot\nof them dealt with what I sensed was an erosion of cohesiveness in the army,\nand, since ours was a citizen military, a fraying of the relationship between the\narmy and Israeli society. To some degree, this was inevitable in a country now\nnearly 45 years old: developed economically and free of the kind of existential\nthreat we’d faced in the early years of the state. But the political divisions over\nthe war in Lebanon, and morale-sapping need to quell the violence on the West\nBank and in Gaza had further strained our unity of purpose.\n\nMilitarily, we were now indisputably strong enough to defeat any of the\nArab armies, even if they launched a joint attack as in 1973. Our most important\noverseas ally, the United States, was committed to helping us retain that\nposition — what both we and they called Israel’s “qualitative edge” — in the\ninterest of our security and their own. But we were facing a series of new,\nunconventional challenges. One of them, which had come on to Dan Shomron’s\nand my radar over the past year, was Iran. Though geographically distant, it was\npotentially the most serious in the longer run, as Dan himself warned Israelis in\nhis final interview as chief of staff. Iran was likely to become even more\nassertive regionally now that the Gulf War had weakened its neighbor and rival,\nIraq. We also knew, from our intelligence sources, that the Iranians were\nmaking preliminary efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\n241\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011712",
