And you see the same thing in the Office of Legal Counsel, where you have, you know,\nlawyers loaning their credentials to approving what are clear violations of the Geneva Conventions.\"\n\n(https://www.democracynow.org/2009/4/21/the story of mitchell jessen associates )]\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
