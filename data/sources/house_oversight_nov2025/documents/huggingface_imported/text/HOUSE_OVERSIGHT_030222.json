However, Editors can pay for people, stories and documents. \nThey can even pay criminals if it is in the public interest. \nMaz can pay who he wants for info but the Yorkshire Ripper for instance, as a convicted criminal, can't sell his \nstory...unless in public interest cos there was say, a bent detective. \nFax: \nBelow is from PCC Code for Editors. It is not well drafted. \n15 \nWitness payments in criminal trials \ni) No payment or offer of payment to a witness - or any person who \nmay reasonably be expected to be called as a witness - should be made \nin any case once proceedings are active as defined by the Contempt of \nCourt Act 1981. \nThis prohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed \nunconditionally by police without charge or bail or the proceedings \nare otherwise discontinued; or has entered a guilty plea to the court; \nor, in the event of a not guilty plea, the court has announced its \nverdict. \n*ii) Where proceedings are not yet active but are likely and \nforeseeable, editors must not make or offer payment to any person who \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030222 \nmay reasonably be expected to be called as a witness, unless the \ninformation concerned ought demonstrably to be published in the public \ninterest and there is an over-riding need to make or promise payment \nfor this to be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken to \nensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses \ngive. In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the \noutcome of a trial. \n*iii) Any payment or offer of payment made to a person later cited to \ngive evidence in proceedings must be disclosed to the prosecution and \ndefence. The witness must be advised of this requirement. \n16 \n*Payment to criminals \ni) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information, \nwhich seek to exploit a particular crime or to glorify or glamorise \ncrime in general, must not be made directly or via agents to convicted \nor confessed criminals or to their associates — who may include \nfamily, friends and colleagues. \nii) Editors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers \nwould need to demonstrate that there was good reason to believe the \npublic interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public \ninterest emerged, then the material should not be published. \nRoss Gow \nManaging Partner \nACUITY Reputation Limited \nMobile \nTel• \nacuityreputation.com <____________ \nSent from my iPad \nOn 10 Mar 2011, at 16:41, GMAX \n> wrote: \nActually school means university in the states.

'School' can mean university. Age of \nconsent in Florida is complex — see below: \nIf you are 16-yrs-old, a sexual relationship with someone 18-24is legal in Florida. The two persons \ninvolved must be between 16 and 24. \nFlorida Statute 794.05 \n(1) A person 24 years of age or older who engages in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17  \nyears of age commits a felony of the second degree.  \nSo as soon as you turn 16 you are able to have sexual relations. And you can have sexual relations \nwith a minor (under 18) until your 24th birthday.  \n'Females for JE': Disturbing \nlog of telephone calls from \nschoolchildren found in sex \nden of Duke's billionaire \nfriend \nBy Stephen Wright <http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=y &authornamef=Stephen+  \nWright <http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=y &authomamef=Stephen+ Wright> > \nLast updated at 6:30 PM on 9th March 2011 \nDetails of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily Mail \nuncovered logs of telephone messages left at his Florida child sex den. \nSchoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages for the \n58-year-old billionaire friend of Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex offences. \nGhislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is named \nin several messages. \nDisturbing: Messages were found in Florida home of Jeffrey Epstein, left. The billionaire, 58, is a \nfriend of Prince Andrew, right \nIn one left for her or 'Sarah', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come this night \nfor the massage'. \nOther messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, contain such phrases as: 'She has \nfemales for Mr JE' and 'I have a female for him'. \nAnother with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just did a \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030224 \ngood one — 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, \"I love Jeffrey\")'. \nThe long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends including \nthe business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and magician David \nCopperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. \nThe sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of which were \n'erotic' and allegedly involved the abused girls. \nThe evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into Epstein \nand seen yesterday by the Mail. \n<image.png> \n<image.png> \nLogs: Two of the answer phone messages. Miss Maxwell is asked, right, when a girl should give a \nmassage \nOne message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' \nIt was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted police to \nEpstein's abuse. \nAnother note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class — will be out in 45 min. \nLast night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers are \nincluded in the logs. \nOne girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about Epstein. \nA man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.' \nToday, Prince Andrew was embroiled in further controversy as it was revealed Kazakhstan had \nasked for his help in recruiting investors to the country. \nThe plea came after the former Soviet Republic's President's son-in-law had bought the Prince's \nformer marital home for £3million above the asking price. \nTimur Kulibayev paid £15million for Sunninghill Park but it has remained empty and has been \nallowed to fall into disrepair. \nLast year the Prince told Hello! magazine: 'It was like any property deal between friends.' \nYesterday he attempted to perform business as usual as he visited an East London school and met \nrail bosses in Canary Wharf \nHe steadfastly ignored questions from journalists asking whether he was an 'embarrassment to his \ncountry' and would resign from his trade ambassador role as he arrived for a briefing from \nbusiness executives at the headquarters of the £15billion train project Crossrail. \nPrince Andrew managed to sell Sunninghill Park for £3million more than the asking price \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030225 \nRead more: http ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-\ndamning-telephone-log.html#ixzz1GBL6XKcI <http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-\n1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-damning- telephone-lo g.html#ixzz1GBL6XKcI > < \nhttp ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-damning-\ntelephone- log.html <http ://www. dailymail. co .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein-\nThe-damning-telephone-log.html> > \nFrom: Ross Gow \nSent: 10 March 2011 7:48 AM \nTo: Ross gow  \nCc: 1111> ; Ian Maxwell; Kevin Maxwell; Brian \nBasham; Gareth Thompson; \nSubject: Dai y Mai \nMail have published phone logs \nhttp ://www. dailymail. c o.uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-damning-\ntelephone- log.html <http ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/Females- Jeffrey-Ep stein-\nThe-damning-te lephone- lo g.html>  <http ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le- 1364171/F emales-\nJe ffrey-Ep stein- The-damning-telephone-log.html <http ://www. dailymail. c o .uk/news/artic le-\n1364171/F emales- Jeffrey-Epstein- The-damning- telephone- lo g.html> > \nRoss Gow \nManaging Partner \nACUITY Reputation Limited \n23 Berkeley Square \nLondon W1J 6HE \nMobile \nTel \nacuityreputation.com <http://acuityreputation.com > <http://acuityreputation.com > \nSent from my iPad \nOn 10 Mar 2011, at 07:35, Ross gow < \n> < \n> wrote: \n\"Epstein's Gulfstream flew in to RAF Marham with him and the Duke's friend Ghislaine Maxwell \non board, before they enjoyed the Duke's hospitality at the Queen's Norfolk estate 20 miles \naway....\" \nRoss Gow \nManaging Partner \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030226 \nACUITY Reputation Limited \n23 Berkeley Square \nLondon W1J 6HE \nMobile \nTel \nacuityreputation.com <http://acuityreputation.com > <http://acuityreputation.com < \nhttp://acuityreputation.com > > \nSent from my iPad \nOn 9 Mar 2011, at 22:52, Ross Gow < \n> < \n> wrote: \nDear Ghislaine \nThank you for your good-humoured patience with us and the legal team today, during what is, \nunderstandably, a testing time. \nTo confirm: \n1) I spoke to Dilenschneider in NYC at length tonight and shared strategy and role definition. \n2) we sent agreed statement to Dan Mangan ay NYPost - he's on deadline for a piece on Charlie \nSheen/Rob Lowe and seems to have moved on - for the moment. \n3) we will release statement via Press Association and PR Newswire @11.00GMT tmrw and \nfollow up with calls to those journalists who have written pieces. \nWe will create call log/matrix and advise feedback and sentiment as appropriate tmrw.
