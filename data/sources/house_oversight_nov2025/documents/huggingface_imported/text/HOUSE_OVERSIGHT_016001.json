  "text": "Creativity 311\n\nand perspective. Once coded the program takes off and is remarkably\ncreative in its compositions, without any further human intervention.\nHowever, each new capability must be hand-coded by its creator, Harold\nCohen. These paintings give a good visual interpretation for the sort of\nlatitude imposed by the logic limit. AARON can do some very impressive\nthings, but always in a mechanical — albeit beautiful — way, within the\nrules set by Harold Cohen, the true artist. AARON will not suddenly\nawake one morning and independently decide to experiment with the\ncolor blue!\n\nTo give an idea of what I mean by ‘mechanical elaboration’ in a\nmusical context, imagine you were using a Casio synthesizer. These\nmachines have all sorts of fun settings. You can program them to play\ndrum tracks, fill in chords, and add a jazzy, syncopated harmonization\nto your melody. But none of this is truly innovative. It’s mechanical\nelaboration of your artistic material. Jape, AARON and Emily Howell\nall do the same thing within their domain. They mechanically elaborate\nthe artistic creation of their human masters. AARON does an extremely\n\ngood job of this.\n\nThe Myth of the Design Tradeoff\nAn important consequence of the non-linearity of creativity is we are not\nconstrained by tradeoff laws. Let me explain.\n\nVolkswagen Polo\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016001",
