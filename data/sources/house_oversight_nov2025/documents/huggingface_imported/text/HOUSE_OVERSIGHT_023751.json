  "text": "Cognitive Process-Based Education 5\n\nlook at education in a new way. We need to think about how people\nactually learn, regardless of the subject, in order to address them.\n\nLet’s think about dating, then. I was never any good at it as a kid.\nI know how the non-cool guys feel. But, later on, much later on, I got\nvery good at it. So, I must have learned something. What?\n\nWhat was I bad at as a kid? Meeting girls, for one thing. Other kids\ncould do it easily. I always needed to be fixed up.\n\nTalking to girls, for another. I hardly knew any girls. I went to an\nall-boys high school. I was 16 when I went to college and the other\nfreshmen were 18, so that didn’t help either. In other words, I had no\nconfidence.\n\nBut mostly, I had no idea what to say to a girl. What did they talk\nabout?\n\nAnd, one more thing. I really didn’t get the point. I didn’t know\nwhy one wanted to go out with girls anyway. I mean I eventually got\nthe idea, at least I think I did.\n\nWhy am I saying it this way? I am trying to get an insight into the\nlearning process and I am a fine example. I didn’t know how to do it\nand then I did. I didn’t get the point and then I did, sort of. So I must\nhave learned something between the ages of 16 and 60. What?\n\nHere are some things I learned:\n\ne Human relationships are important, but they aren’t easy\nto establish or maintain. They require work.\n\ne The work involves, among other things, learning how to\nlisten and respond to the needs of another human being.\nIt involves subjugating one’s own interests from time to\ntime for the interests of another.\n\ne Girls, and later women, feel good. Being with someone\nwho loves you feels good. Learning to love feels good.\nMore than feeling good, these things are critical for\nstaying alive. This is not so obvious when you are\nsurrounded by love from your family. But eventually you\nare alone, and alone is not so much fun.\n\nAs this is not a chapter on love, I will stop there. Suffice it to say\nthat I learned how to meet girls, how to gain their interest, and how to\nform relationships with them. I also learned why I wanted to do that.\n\nNow let’s see what we have learned about learning from my little\ndiversion into teenage angst.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023751",
