Increases in ALT or AST (>3x\nULN) occurred in 12 CBD and 1 placebo patient, all of whom were on concomitant\nvalproic acid. All elevations resolved. SAEs were seen in 10 Epidiolex patients vs. three\non placebo. Eight patients on Epidiolex discontinued treatment compared with one\npatient on placebo, due to adverse events similar to those above, including three due to\nALT/AST elevations.\n\nFigure 122 Safety Data From Epidiolex’s First Phase III Trial In Dravet Syndrome\n\n(CBD (n=61) Placebo (n=59)\nn(%) n(%)\n\nAll-causality TEAES 57 (83.4%) 44 (74.6%)\nTreatment-related TEAES 43(70.5%) 16 (27.1%)\nTEAEs leading to withdrawal 9(14.8%) 1(1L.7%)\nSerious TEAEs 10(16.4%) 3(5.1%)\nTreatment-related serious TEAEs 5 (8.2%) ie)\nTEAEs reported in >10% of patients in either group by preferred term\nSomnolence 22 (36.1%) 6(10.2%)\nDiarrhea 19(31.1%) 6 (10.2%)\nDecreased appetite 17 (27.9%) 3(5.1%)\nFatigue 12(19.7%) 2(34%)\nPyrexia 9(14.8%) 5 (8.5%)\nVomiting 9(14.8%) 3(5.1%)\nLethargy (13.1%) 3(5.1%)\nUpper respiratory tract infection 7 (11.5%) 5 (8.5%)\nConvulsion 7 (11.5%) 3(5.1%)\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nIn 2015, GW initiated two Phase III trials in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The first trial\nenrolled 171 patients, and the second enrolled 225. In the first LGS study, the patients\nwere randomized 1:1 to 20mg/kg or placebo while in the second, they were randomized\n1:1:1 to 20mg/kg Epidiolex, 10mg/kg Epidiolex, or placebo.
