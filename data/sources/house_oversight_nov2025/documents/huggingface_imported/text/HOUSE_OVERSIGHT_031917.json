General Assembly will\nvote on whether to recognize Palestine as an independent and\nsovereign state with full rights in the United Nations. In many ways,\nthis would appear to be a reasonable and logical step. Whatever the\nPalestinians once were, they are clearly a nation in the simplest and\nmost important sense - namely, they think of themselves as a nation.\nNations are created by historical circumstances, and those\ncircumstances have given rise to a Palestinian nation. Under the\nprinciple of the United Nations and the theory of the right to national\nself-determination, which is the moral foundation of the modern\ntheory of nationalism, a nation has a right to a state, and that state has\na place in the family of nations. In this sense, the U.N. vote will be\nunexceptional.\n\nHowever, when the United Nations votes on Palestinian statehood, it\nwill intersect with other realities and other historical processes. First,\nit is one thing to declare a Palestinian state; it is quite another thing to\ncreate one. The Palestinians are deeply divided between two views of\nwhat the Palestinian nation ought to be, a division not easily\novercome. Second, this vote will come at a time when two of Israel's\nneighbors are coping with their own internal issues. Syria is in chaos,\nwith an extended and significant resistance against the regime having\nemerged. Meanwhile, Egypt is struggling with internal tension over\nthe fall of President Hosni Mubarak and the future of the military\njunta that replaced him. Add to this the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq\nand the potential rise of Iranian power, and the potential recognition\nof a Palestinian state - while perfectly logical in an abstract sense -\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031917",
