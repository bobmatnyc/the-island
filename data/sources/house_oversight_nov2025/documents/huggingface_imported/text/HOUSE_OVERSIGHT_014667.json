He\nshouldn't be hurting other girls. Following\nEpstein’s arrest, investigators are believed to\nhave found a list of men’s names on his\ncomputer and asked him whether they had been\n‘treated’ to sexual encounters with his menage\nof minors.\n\nConviction: Jeffrey Epstein\n\n‘He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question,\nit could be incriminating,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday.\n\nEpstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a ‘slap on the wrist’ for him,\nand ended up serving 13 months of his sentence, much of it in a liberal work-release programme\nLawyer Brad Edwards, who represented several of Epstein’s victims, said: ‘Rather than punish him\nthe way they would an average Joe, they sent a clear message that with enough money and power\nand influence, the system can be bought.’\n\nVirginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings\nbottled up until last weekend's photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories.\n\nVirginia says: ‘| am appalled. To me, it’s saying, “We are above the law.” But Jeffrey is a monster.’\nLast night, neither Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell nor Prince Andrew would comment on Virginia’s story.\n\nShare or comment on this article\n\nNeed Business Capital?
