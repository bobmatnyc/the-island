Here is what one of my participants pictured:\n\n\"I was getting my hair cut to donate to Locks of Love [a charity that\nfashions wigs for young cancer patients]. It had taken me years to\ngrow it out, and my friends were all there to help celebrate. We went\nto my favorite hair place in Brooklyn and then went to lunch at our\nfavorite restaurant.\"\n\nI asked another participant to imagine a plane ride. \"I imagined the\ntakeoff — my favorite! — and then the eight-hour-long nap in\nbetween and then finally landing in Krakow and clapping for the pilot\nfor providing the safe voyage,\" she responded. No tarmac delays, no\nscreaming babies. The world, only a year or two into the future, was a\nwonderful place to live in.\n\nIf all our participants insisted on thinking positively when it came to\nwhat lay in store for them personally, what does that tell us about\nhow our brains are wired? Is the human tendency for optimism a\nconsequence of the architecture of our brains?\n\nThe Human Time Machine\n\nTo think positively about our prospects, we must first be able to\nimagine ourselves in the future. Optimism starts with what may be\nthe most extraordinary of human talents: mental time travel, the\nability to move back and forth through time and space in one's mind.\nAlthough most of us take this ability for granted, our capacity to\nenvision a different time and place is in fact critical to our survival.\n\nIt is easy to see why cognitive time travel was naturally selected for\nover the course of evolution. It allows us to plan ahead, to save food\nand resources for times of scarcity and to endure hard work in\nanticipation of a future reward. It also lets us forecast how our current\nbehavior may influence future generations. If we were not able to\npicture the world in a hundred years or more, would we be concerned\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030286",
