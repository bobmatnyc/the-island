  "text": "Turing’s Machine 225\n\nexecution. You might ask what runs the operating system and that is a\nsmaller program called the BIOS. What runs BIOS? An even smaller\nprogram called the Bootstrap. Once all this is up and running you have a\nworking computer, which can run any program you throw at it.\n\nThe problem with programs is they tend to crash — usually at\nthe most inconvenient times. It is often not clear whether a program\nhas truly crashed. It might be stuck in an infinite loop, or it could be\ncalculating the answer to a complex question, such as the answer to life,\nthe Universe, and everything. How would we know? If only I had waited\na little longer before rebooting, the program would have run to its end\nand given me the answer to Douglas Adams’ question.\n\nIt would be very useful, and save a great deal of time, if I had a way\nof telling whether a program will ever stop. An elegant solution would be\nto have a second program called “Halt, which would test the program and\noutput ‘will halt’ or ‘will crash’ as appropriate. It turns out this program\nwould be more than just useful. It could be used as an oracle, capable of\nanswering almost any question imaginable.\n\nI could, for example, write a program that says: for every index in\nFermat’s puzzle try every number and halt if you find a solution greater\nthan 2. Now if I run my halt program on this program and it states ‘will\ncrash; I will have solved Fermat’s Last Theorem! Do you see why?\n\nIf we give ‘Halt’ an input: a program we are interested in, along with\nsome data, it will tell us if the program finds an answer. If I am trying to\nsolve Fermat’s Last Theorem, we will ask it to try every possible index for\nthe equation 3*+4*=5* and halt when it finds a true result greater than 2.\nIf the halt program says yes and halts, you can trace through the program\nand work out how it did it. The theory would be proved. If the program\nsays no, the theory is disproved. This gives us a way to discover proofs of\nmany mathematical theorems.\n\nI could try almost any puzzle using a program with this form. All I\nneed do is put a problem in the following decision format: try all possible\noptions, and then stop and ring a bell if a solution is found. The Halt\nprogram would then give the result leading to untold riches, winning all\nthe remaining Clay Mathematics prizes at the very least and earning me\n$6m.\n\nDoes such a magical program exist? The answer, sadly, is no. There\nis no Halt program and the final part of Turing’s paper proved there can\nnever be.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015915",
