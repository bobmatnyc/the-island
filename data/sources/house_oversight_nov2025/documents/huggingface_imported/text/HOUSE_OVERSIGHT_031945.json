  "text": "Erian, a veteran Brotherhood leader and the vice chairman of its new\nparty, who met with Mr. Walles. “And we are keen and eager to say\nthat we respect the democratic process and the rights of all people\naccording to the Constitution and the law.”\n\nAdministration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to\ndiscuss private diplomatic exchanges, said they hoped that a\ncombination of internal and external pressure on the council would\npersuade it to yield power and submit to civilian oversight. In\naddition to the public comments by Mrs. Clinton, other senior\nAmerican officials have privately urged the council to revise its\nrecent proposals to preserve power, the officials said.\n\nThe officials noted that since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, the council’s\nleaders had repeatedly offered, then backed away from, some\nproposals only after street protests and public pressure, in a kind of\nprolonged back-and-forth that some noted reflected a true, if messy,\ndemocratic process taking root.\n\nBut administration officials and Egyptian activists note worrying\nsigns. The military core of Mr. Mubarak’s government has\n“reasserted itself again,” a senior administration official said. “We\ndon’t have great expectations that this is going to be the creation of a\ndemocratic system,” the official said, referring to the coming\nelections.\n\nAt best, the official added, the elections will be “a transition to a\ntransition,” one that could leave the military as the de facto power in\nEgypt for years to come, as it was under Mr. Mubarak’s rule.\n\nThe military has said that it intends to hold ultimate political power\neven after the election of a Parliament in the coming months, and that\nit will play a role in drafting the constitution as well. It has refused to\nlift the Mubarak-era “emergency law” allowing arrests without trial,\nand it has sent as many as 12,000 civilians to military trials.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031945",
