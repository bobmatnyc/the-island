COWEN'S COLLECTIVE VIEW OF CBD

FEBRUARY 25, 2019

11 Cowen analysts across consumer, health
care, industrials, and regulatory offer a
comprehensive view of the global CBD
opportunity.

Nearly 7% of adults in our proprietary U.S.
survey (n = ~2,500) reported using CBD as a
supplement, far higher than we expected.

We believe U.S. CBD can conservatively
generate sales of $16 bn by 2025. We offer
detailed analysis at the sub-category level, as
well as company-specific discussions, including
Outperform rated WEED, TLRY, and TPB.
