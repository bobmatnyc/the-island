Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor was
previously rebuked for handling of a
child sex case

Julie K. Brown

Nine months before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey
Epstein, Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead

prosecutor in Epstein’s case had concealed victim information in another underage
sex crimes case, the Miami Herald has learned.

The prosecutor, A. Marie Villafafa, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in
January 2007 for what he called her “intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment”
when she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who
traveled to Florida to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, had a prior history of
predatory behavior with minors, court records show.

Acosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafafa’s breach — records show
that he subsequently defended it. Acosta assigned another prosecutor in his office to
write a treatise for the judge in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to soften
the stinging language in his order.

Senior U.S. District Court Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order,
noting, “The court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the United States Attorney
for the Southern District of Florida, as well as the Assistant United States Attorney
assigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ...
information from the court.”
