  "text": "police car respects the force field he creates, and the cops drive around\nhim.\n\nObviously he originally started this strange stint as a matter of\nchoice. “I think I’ Il walk around in circles on the boardwalk today.” And\nthe next day. And the next. But somewhere along the way, walking around\nin circles became a compulsion, and /t started doing Aim. When you play a\nrole long enough, the role can begin to play you if you’ re not careful.\n\nI' ve been out at six o’ clock in the morning and there was the\nPacer walking in circles. I’ ve been out at six 0’ clock in the evening and\nthere was the Pacer walking in circles. He does stop to eat—which\nindicates that at some level he is still acting voluntarily. He walks in a\nstraight line to a greasy-spoon diner nearby on the boardwalk and sits at\nthe counter, but he doe not twirl on his stool, nor stir his coffee, nor roll\nhis eyes.\n\nOnce he talked about his obsessive activity: “I'’ m in control of\nwalking, but out of control too.
