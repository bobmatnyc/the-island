  "text": "election with the Russians, OMG! The anti-Trump world, and especially its media—that\nis, the media—believed that there was a high, if not overwhelming, likelihood that there\nwas something significant there, and a decent chance that it could be brought home.\n\nIf the media, self-righteously, saw it as the Holy Grail and silver bullet of Trump\ndestruction, and the Trump White House saw it, with quite some self-pity, as a desperate\neffort to concoct a scandal, there was also a range of smart money in the middle.\n\nThe congressional Democrats had everything to gain by insisting, Benghazi-like, that\nwhere there was smoke (even if they were desperately working the bellows) there was fire,\nand by using investigations as a forum to promote their minority opinion (and for\nmembers to promote themselves).\n\nFor Republicans in Congress, the investigations were a card to play against Trump’s\nvengefulness and unpredictability. Defending him—or something less than defending him\nand, indeed, possibly pursuing him—offered Republicans a new source of leverage in their\ndealings with him.\n\nThe intelligence community—with its myriad separate fiefdoms as suspicious of\nTrump as of any incoming president in memory—would, at will, have the threat of drip-\ndrip-drip leaks to protect its own interests.\n\nThe FBI and DOJ would evaluate the evidence—and the opportunity—through their\nown lenses of righteousness and careerism. (“The DOJ is filled with women prosecutors\nlike Yates who hate him,” said a Trump aide, with a curiously gender-biased view of the\ngrowing challenge.)\n\nIf all politics is a test of your opponent’s strength, acumen, and forbearance, then this,\nregardless of the empirical facts, was quite a clever test, with many traps that many people\nmight fall into. Indeed, in many ways the issue was not Russia but, in fact, strength,\nacumen, and forbearance, the qualities Trump seemed clearly to lack. The constant\nharping about a possible crime, even if there wasn’t an actual crime—and no one was yet\npointing to a specific act of criminal collusion, or in fact any other clear violation of the\nlaw—could force a cover-up which might then turn into a crime. Or turn up a perfect\nstorm of stupidity and cupidity.\n\n“They take everything I’ve ever said and exaggerate it,” said the president in his first\nweek in the White House during a late-night call. “It’s all exaggerated. My exaggerations\nare exaggerated.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nFranklin Foer, the Washington-based former editor of the New Republic, made an early\ncase for a Trump-Putin conspiracy on July 4, 2016, in S/ate. His piece reflected the\nincredulity that had suddenly possessed the media and political intelligentsia: Trump, the\nunserious candidate, had, however incomprehensibly, become a more or less serious one.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019958",
