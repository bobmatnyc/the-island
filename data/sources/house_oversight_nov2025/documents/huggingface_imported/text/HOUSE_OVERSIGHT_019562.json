  "text": "CHAPTER 8\nRaider of the Inner Sanctum\n\nThey think there’s a smoking gun in there that would be the\ndeath of them all politically.\n\n—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2014\n\nHE NIGHTMARE OF THE NSA is a penetration. As the CIA, the\n\nFBI, and the NSA found out in the 1990s, no intelligence service\nis invulnerable to it. Any employee of a large intelligence organiza-\ntion can turn, or be turned, against it. Among the more than ten\nthousand intelligence workers employed by the NSA, it is a near\ncertainty that over time more than one of them will become dis-\nsatisfied with their work. A worker may have a personal grievance\nabout salary, lack of promotion, or treatment by his or her superi-\nors. Disenchantment with the NSA may also proceed from idealis-\ntic objections. The NSA is in the business of secretly intercepting\nmessages, and an insider could come to find its spying activities at\nodds with his or her own beliefs about the violation of privacy. For\nany of these reasons, a disgruntled insider could go rogue. He or she\nthen might attempt to right a perceived wrong by disclosing NSA\nsecrets to another party. That party might then induce or blackmail\nthe rogue employee into disclosing further secrets.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 74 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019562",
