Morell suggested in his book that\nSnowden might not himself have fully realized “when and how he\nwould be used.”\n\nIt can be safely assumed that the decision made by Putin’s intel-\nligence service to allow Snowden to travel to Russia proceeded from\nsomething other than softhearted sentiment about his welfare. After\nPutin learned that there was an American in Hong Kong from the\n“special services” seeking to come to Russia, he also learned from\nSnowden’s own disclosure on the video released that Snowden had\ntaken a large number of NSA documents to Hong Kong: indeed,\nsome were shown on the video. After that self-outing by Snowden,\nPutin had plenty of time to calculate the advantages and disadvan-\ntages of allowing him to come to Moscow.\n\nPutin could offer him not only freedom from arrest but also a\nplatform to express his views. The exploitation of an intelligence\ndefector, even after he yields his secrets, can be the final stage of\na successful intelligence operation. The CIA considered one of its\ngreatest coups of the Cold War its release of the espionage-acquired\n\n© secret speech of Nikita Khrushchev to the Communist Party of the ©\nSoviet Union in 1956 exposing the transgressions of the previous\nregime of Joseph Stalin. Making public these deeds was meant by\nthe CIA to sow discord both inside the Soviet Union and to disrupt\nits relations with its allies. General Alexander suggested that Putin\nmight similarly be “looking to capitalize on the fact that [Snowden’s]\nactions are enormously disruptive and damaging to US interests.”\nThis potential gain, if Alexander’s assessment is correct, provided\nPutin with an additional reason to have his representatives in Hong\nKong offer Snowden exfiltration.\n\nSnowden was in no position to refuse. After the release of the\nvideo, there was no going back to America without his facing a\ndetermined criminal prosecution. He would have known that in\nalmost every prior case intelligence workers who had intentionally\nreleased even a single classified document had gone to prison. As his\nInternet postings show, he had closely followed the ordeal of Bradley\nManning, whose trial was coming to its conclusion while Snowden\nwas in Hong Kong.
