We are not big buyers of Chinese onshore equities for reasons we have\nexplained before, but we do rely on 7%-8% Chinese GDP growth to fuel economic activity in Asia that underpins many\nof our investments there. As things stand now, we see no reason why this growth target will not be achieved.\n\nChinese economic monitor, percent change*, YoY, sa, 2006 to present\n\nTotal loans\nMoney\nsupply \\\nNon-food CPI\n\nPassenger car Fixed asset Housing price to\nsales investment income\n\nShenzhen\n\nElectricity Cement\nproduction production production\n\nSource: Nationa Bureau of Statistics, PROC, China Automotive Information, China Economic Information Network, CLSA-Markit, Haver Analytics.
