  "text": "instrument to undermine the investigation.\n\nAccording to present and former White House advisors, the\nPresident's recent spates of pardons are in part his way of taunting the\nSpecial Counsel. The White House, according to these sources, is aware\nthat the Special Counsel has concluded the pardon power is near\nabsolute: the President can certainly pardon himself, and others\ninvolved in the investigation.\n\nEarly in June, the Special Counsel, believing that a pardon for\nMichael Flynn was imminent, rushed to build a case that might form an\nexception to the President's pardon authority. The argument, perhaps a\nslim thread one, tries to undermine what both the White House and\nmany outside legal authorities, and much of the Special Counsel's own\nresearch, believes to be one of the few unchallengeable powers granted\nthe President. In effect, the Special Counsel continues the theme of it’s\ncase: there is a level of obstruction of justice that all reasonable men\nmight know when they see it. If you pardon someone to get yourself off\nthe hook, that’s a \"corrupt\" action. Since the President is in charge of\nupholding the constitution and much of the constitution is about\npreventing corrupt acts, the pardon, in the case of Michael Flynn, is\nunconstitutional. What's more, since there is an impeachment process\nin place—or there at least several impeachment resolutions before\ncongress—and impeachment is the province of Congress, a pardon ofa\npotential witness in this impeachment is an unconstitutional trampling\non the separation of powers.\n\nAs the President, by nature and design, tries to claim aggressive\nnew powers, the Mueller team, almost in equal proportion, is trying to\nlimit the theory of Presidential power and, even, to criminalize an\nexpansive exercise of those powers.\n\nPeople who know and have worked with Mueller find it, at best,\nunexpected that such a traditional, and by the book, G-man, would be\npursuing such far-reaching legal theories. One view, shared by the\nWhite House, is that Mueller is overly reliant on his staff. In this\nscenario, the legal charge is being led by his number two, Andrew\nWeissman, the aggressive prosecutor whose pursuit of the accounting\nfirm Arthur Anderson in the Enron debacle end in its conviction—a\njudgement reversed well after the firm's bankrupcy and dissolution.\nWeissman is a particular bet noir and favorite whipping boy for the\nWhite House.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029172",
