  "text": "capital of both North and South Cyprus, remains today as the last divided\ncity in Europe and the only divided capital in the world. However, the\nCyprus problem has to change face and move on from this conundrum\ncharacterized by a relentlessly enduring state of conflict to an inspirational\nsuccess story of peace. Time is ripe for such a change, especially in view\nof current dynamics that are molding together both on the island and in the\nregion.\n\nMissed Opportunities\n\nApril 24, 2014 marked the 10th anniversary of the referenda held on the\nUN Comprehensive Settlement Plan (the Annan Plan) on both sides of the\nisland. This was the first time in the history of Cyprus negotiations that a\ncomprehensive settlement document, comprising 9,000 pages, was put to\nseparate simultaneous referenda.

Yet, it further complicated the prospects of reconciliation\non the island.\n\nThriving Opportunities from Within\n\nAgainst this background, the Turkish Cypriot side has intensified its\nendeavors to overcome this crisis of confidence and engaged sincerely\nwith the Greek Cypriot side for the preparation of the ground for a new\ndialogue. Subsequently, the two sides were able to initiate a series of\nagreements in early 2008, which paved the way for the resumption of full-\nfledged negotiations after a four-year stalemate.
