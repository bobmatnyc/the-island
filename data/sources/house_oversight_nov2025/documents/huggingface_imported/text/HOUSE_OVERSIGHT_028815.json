Negative aspects associated with a brand can leave a long-term \nimpact on its reputation. If a customer is facing a problem with your product or service, \nthe world is going to hear about it. On the contrary, social media has the ultimate ability \nto turn audiences into customers and communicate positive messages. \nA marketer's worst nightmare is a social media campaign gone wrong. In such a \nsituation, resources are diverted to fix the problem, disrupting the entire workflow. \nDuring a social media crisis, marketers are left with limited control over the market as \nthe news spreads like wildfire. Businesses need to choose the right strategy and the \nmost appropriate way to respond. \nWith an increase in social media, marketing has become a two-way conversation \nbetween brand and consumer. Customers demand businesses to be proactive and \nefficient to meet their demands and InsightsPod provides businesses with the data to do \njust that and more. \nSolution \nInsightsPod is an ambitious, innovative new company that is helping businesses, \ngovernments, and investors in analyzing opinions, sentiments, emotions, and attitudes \nof people from social media. \nImagine a customer leaves a bad review for your product. To improve your reputation \nand the overall customer experience, we help you identify which customer is \ndissatisfied in minutes. We help businesses determine a customer's intent and buying \nhabits. \nPage 1 I \nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

It also tracks channel \nperformance, monitors response times and benchmark against competitors. \nOur competitors are offering a variety of services but the distinguishing factor between \nus and the competitors is that we support 73 languages and offer location based \nsentiment analysis. We also support multiple data sources including \nTwitter, YouTube, Facebook and discussion boards. \nExpectations \nForecast \nWe are projecting sales of $400,000 in Year 1, $850,000 in Year 2, and $1.6 million in Year \n3 with a profit margin of 100%.

No loans \nhave been taken. Founders are not taking any salaries and will not do so for another 2 \nyears. \nWe are looking to raise $2.4 million at a $10 million valuation to scale. We require \n$800,000 per year for the next three years. The proceedings will be used to: \n- Refine our sentiment analysis system (currently 5% false positives) \n- Hire a PR firm \n- Hire a Data Scientist \n- Marketing and Sales (UK and US Market) \n- Office space in London and San Francisco \nPage 4 I \nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

The service is extremely relevant, timely, and accurate \nenabling clients to make informed decisions. Social media platforms such as Facebook, \nYouTube, and Twitter are used to gather live feeds on which we run a sentiment \nanalysis, and in turn, offer our clients a superior approach to market research. We \nprovide the expertise to companies seeking the means to develop and improve their \nproducts and services. To improve a company's reputation and overall customer \nexperience, we help identify which customer is dissatisfied in minutes. We help \nbusinesses determine a customer's intent and buying habits. Through the vast amounts \nof data available across social media, we not only help politicians to understand what \ntheir constituencies are talking about but also to influence people, track voters and get \nthem to vote. Investors who predict stock behavior by interpreting the news and public \nsentiment make better trades. InsightsPod can give an insight into public sentiment \nquickly and can aid financial institutions, as well as individuals, to make sound \ninvestment decisions. \nInsightsPod has already been tested during the recent EU referendum and it is \ncurrently evaluating public opinion on the two US presidential candidates; Donald \nTrump and Hillary Clinton. The results that InsightsPod produced during the \nreferendum proved to be positive in favour of a Brexit, and a week later, Britain voted \nto leave the EU, indicating that our model was reliable. The final results of the \nreferendum were the complete opposite of the poll projected figures; the Leave \ncampaign won with a 51.9% majority. This is potentially a great example of how polls \nare not as reliable as we originally thought them to be when it comes to collecting data \non general public consensus. In contrast, we gather live feeds on significant political \nevents to aid political figures in their campaigns and activities. \nPage 5 I \nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE. This business plan contains confidential, trade-secret \ninformation and is shared only with the understanding that you will not share its contents or ideas with \nthird parties without the express written consent of the plan author. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028822 \nInsightsPod \nTarget Market \nOur target market will range from individuals, political parties, well-known \nbusinesses e.g. McDonalds, Nike, Apple, and government institutions needing \ninformation on any particular areas of concern. \nBusinesses, such as the aforementioned, have a huge social media presence on a global \nlevel. This is essential and effective in being able to communicate information to a mass \nof consumers, both current and potential, and to receive feedback faster than you would \nvia other means of communication. However, with such global exposure combined \nwith the speed of social media, the brand image and company reputation of these \nbusinesses is now more vulnerable to change than ever before. There are many \nexamples from the past that can be cited in which negative tweets about companies \nproducts, services, and even marketing strategies, went viral causing a huge onslaught \nof negative public opinion, thus, having an adverse effect on the company in question. \nIn a similar fashion, government institutions have also been the victim of negative \npublic sentiment posted online on various social media platforms directly affecting \npolitical parties and their reputations, and the number of votes in a particular party's \nfavour (on both local and national levels). \nThe stock market is malleable and is affected by global consensus in various circles of \ninterest, therefore, an investor keeps a close eye on that consensus when it comes to \nmaking profitable trades and investment decisions. An ill-informed investment decision \nmade based on inaccurate information on global consensus could result in huge losses \nfor an investor. Clearly, the problems our target clients face are all similar in nature and, \nin one way or another, affect each other. \nCompetition \nCurrent Alternatives \nCompetition does exist in the industry InsightsPod is operating in. IBM Watson \nAnalytics, Lexalytics, and Falcon.I0 are some of our competitors. However, we have an \nPage 6 I \nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

This could \nbe significant to both retail brands and political parties, or individuals too. \n• Our platform also has the potential to process data in a multitude of languages, \nhence, the outcome tends to be more precise and effective. \n• Highly customizable service - we assist our customers in engaging their target \naudience \nPage 7 I \nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

There are four companies in San Francisco \nthat are under consideration amongst which we will opt for one; The Outcast Agency, \nSpark, SutherlandGold Group, and Brew. Usually, these companies charge $15,000 to \n$20,000 per month for their services. \nFeature articles and product reviews will help launch awareness of our platform. \nOnline advertisement will help with buyer impressions. The top 20 to 30 customers in \neach segment will be approached first; a few sales hits in these top tiers will enable \nachievement of targeted forecasts. \nSales Plan \nIn the first couple of months, the company will set up the office, hire a competent PR \nfirm and members of sales/business development to generate sales. There will be no \nsales activity during this time span. Revenue will begin to flow in by the end of the first \nsix months. \nInsightsPod expects to generate revenue from a subscription-based model. In order to \ndemonstrate the capability of our platform, InsightsPod's website will display limited \nlive insights on popular topics. Currently, we are displaying live insights on the US \npresidential election's candidates and the Apple iPhone 7. In addition to this, key \ncontacts with senior writers at Wired Magazine, Business Week, CNet, and ZDnet \nwill bring positive national attention to our technology. \nWe anticipate that the initial revenues will come from businesses who will subscribe to \nour service. InsightsPod will rigorously pursue government contracts from federal, state \nand local governments. InsightsPod can be used by LEA to detect criminal and terrorist \nPage 8 I \nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

We will enlist the help of consultants familiar with government bidding \nprocesses, and those who have contacts within different departments. We will also \npursue political parties. \nDue to InsightsPod being a new entity, we understand that we will have to prove our \ncompany's worth to businesses in order to earn their respect and business. We will \nprovide free sample reports to potential clients. InsightsPod will also offer an 800 \nnumber phone line for customer service purposes. \nPricing \nCustomers will be charged according to the number of impressions being processed by \nInsightsPod.

We have yet to decide on the two locations, however, we are leaning towards \nOakland due to lower running costs and the accessibility of tech resources. We will also \nhave one office set up in London where we will appoint one salesperson. We currently \nhave an operating office space in Islamabad and our back-end developers will be \nworking from this location. \nTechnology \nOur platform acquires data from different social media sites and discussion forums. \nCurrently, we are supporting Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. We can acquire \nunlimited Twitter data which includes historical data for $60,000 per year. For Facebook \nand YouTube, we have developed our own crawler that collects data from both \nwebsites.

From each brand/retailer, we have assumed to earn a revenue of \n$25,000 to $30,000 per year. Additional revenue will be received through providing \nconsulting services to clients, especially government sectors and political parties. \nIn our first three years, we are projecting $400,000 in Year 1, $850,000 in Year 2 and \n$1.6 million in Year 3 in revenue with a 100% profit margin. We expect PR and \nMarketing to be our top expense. The first 2 years' payroll costs will be minimal as \nfounding members are not taking any salary for that period of time. \nPage 13 I \nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

The biggest \nexpense will be contracting of a PR/Marketing Agency. We have allocated $192,000 for \nthis. \nWe have allocated $103,000 per year for product development. The breakdown of this \namount is as follows: \n• We plan to hire a Data Scientist who will be paid $24,000 per year. To reduce the \nexpense we will hire a Data Scientist in Pakistan. The current salary of an \nexperienced Data Scientist working for companies like Teradata and Telenor is \n$2000-$2500 per month. \n• Our development team in Pakistan will consist of five team members. The \nsalaries for our two senior developers will be $18,000 each, making that a total of \n$36,000 per year.

Also, we plan on \nparticipating in industry related events every quarter such as exhibitions and trade \nshows. \nData acquisition from Twitter will cost us $60,000 per year. Our office space expense \nis for two locations, i.e. Oakland or San Francisco and London. \nWe don't plan on paying ourselves salaries until after 2 years, and even then, we will \nkeep them low so we can invest as much as we can back into the business. \nSources of Funds \nWe have already covered our startup costs. The founder is currently paying the salaries \nof programmers and the back-end office of Tranchulas Islamabad is being used to \nfacilitate the development process. All servers are currently hosted in Germany which is \nalso funded by the founder. The company has no loans and has no intention of taking \nout any loans from banks.
