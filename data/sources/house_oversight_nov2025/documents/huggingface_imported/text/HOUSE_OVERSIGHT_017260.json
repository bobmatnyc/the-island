  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nI was reminded of Chief Justice Berger’s bear baiting hypothetical in the I Am Curious Yellow\ncase, but this time the stakes were much higher. I answered the Justice’s question:\n\nNo. That wouldn't be enough.\n\nAnd that is not this case in any event.\n\nThis case is handing guns over, under an agreement that no shooting would take place.\nIn Enmund the guns were provided.\n\nWhat Your Honor, Justice Scalia, is asking for, in a sense, is a return to the felony murder\nrule where guns are provided.\n\nJustice Scalia didn’t seem satisfied with my answer, so I threw a hypothetical back to him—law\nprofessor to law professor:\n\nAnd to throw a hypothetical back, which I'm not entitled to do, but I'll throw it back to\nmyself...what if there were a statute saying, anyone who provides guns to an armed\nrobber in the course of an armed robbery, whereby death results, is guilty of first-degree\ncapital murder?\n\nThat would be clearly within Enmund.\n\nThat's what Enmund decided.\n\nBecause the facts of Enmund were exactly that.\n\nThe dialogue continued:\nJustice:\nIn Enmund, had he provided the gun?\nMr. Dershowitz:\nThe state certainly argued that he had provided the gun in Enmund.\nThe gun had belonged to his common law wife.\nHe then disposed of the gun.\nCertainly, a reasonable judge and jury could conclude that he had provided the gun.\n\nIt was an armed robbery.\n\nL73\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017260",
