The Géttingen event had to be cancelled so that means | now do not have an air ticket to Germany. |\nam going to check whether | can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime |\nthought | should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket.\n\nLawrence.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029192",
