  "text": "Director Tate.»\n: eorge Clooney” _ A\n\navigating our presidential\n\ncampaign was a piece of cake\n\ncompared to understanding the\nnuances of the 2011 Oscar race for the\nmost revered artistic honor in the world.\n\nThis is how nine films fell into the big\npicture.\n\nThree premiered in Cannes mid-May,\na distant nine months ago, creating an\nOscar campaign as long as any human\npregnancy. At the Palais, the first inkling\nof Oscar buzz was born as the reclusive\nWoody Allen premiered Midnight in\nParis. PBS later aired a documentary of\nWoody discussing his forty-four films\nshowing the astonishing depth of his\ntalent that made you want to immediately\nhand him the Oscar for Best Picture.\nAcademy rules and Woody forbade\nmarketing this gem.\n\nWoody is not a member of the\nAcademy becase he doesn't feel that films\nshould be in competition. He told me, “A\nstatue does not change your life. You still\nget a cold. You can't get a date. You still\n\n58 | AVENUE MAGAZINE « APRIL 2012\n\nhave everyday things to worry about.”\nThe Academy learned to love him from\na distance and gave him Best Original\nScreenplay as a consolation.\n\nTerrence Malicks long-awaited,\nesoteric The Tree of Life was unveiled at\nCannes and won the coveted Palme D’Or,\npositioning it for a nomination.\n\nThe Artist, created by the French, shot\nin Hollywood and about Hollywood was\nthe festival surprise. This charming and\noddly original black-and-white silent\nentry was introduced by the ringmaster\nhimself, Harvey Weinstein. No one\ncould pronounce or spell director Michel\nHazanavicius’s name. Jean Dujardin\ncould not speak a word of English and\nneither could his 10-year-old co-star, the\nJack Russell Uggie who had been rescued\nfrom the pound after two adopters found\n\nhim too wild. Tragically Uggie developed\nan undisclosed neurological disorder\nduring production, forcing him to retire\nat the height of his popularity.\n\nNo slam dunk Oscar winner emerged in\nCannes. Any future film could easily win.\n\nDreamWorks’ The Help premiered\nin LA in August and distributor Disney\nbegan propelling the politically correct and\nsocially significant film to box office heaven\nof $200 million. Viola Davis and Octavia\nSpencer were forecast to win Oscars.\n\nIn September, the Toronto and New\nYork Film Festivals and Fox Searchlight\npresented Alexander Payne’s Hawaiian\nfamily saga, The Descendants, which broke\nout of the pack with whispers of winning.\nBeloved George Clooney, playing a\nfather for the first time was hailed as a\nshoo-in for best actor. Directing Ides of\nMarch added momentum.\n\nAlso at New York's festival Marty\nScorsese and Paramount sneaked an\nunfinished cut of Hugo in Alice Tully\nHall, built for concerts but converted into\na 3-D theater. Marty was christened the\nvisionary genius of an innovative, costly\n3-D masterpiece.\n\nDirector Bennett Miller's highly\nanticipated Moneyball for Sony hit a\ngrand slam at its west coast premiere in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013452",
