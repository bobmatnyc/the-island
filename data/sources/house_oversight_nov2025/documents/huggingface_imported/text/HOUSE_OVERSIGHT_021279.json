  "text": "humanism that spread simultaneously\ninto Judaism, Christianity, and Islam can\nbe found when the lost texts of Aristotle\nwere discovered, translated, and\nappropriated by scholars from these\nthree religions who worked at the same\ntables in Islamic libraries in Spain and\nSicily during the ninth and tenth\ncenturies. Richard Rubinstein in his\ntimely book titled Aristotle ’s Children\n(2003) tells the story well.’ This gave\nrise to forms of Aristotelian religious\nhumanism in the works of Thomas\nAquinas in Christianity, Maimonides in\nJudaism, and Averroés in Islam. On the\nAmerican scene, one sees another form\nof Christian humanism in the synthesis\nof philosophical pragmatism, with all its\ninfluence from Darwin, and expressions\nof liberal Christianity and the social\ngospel movement. *\n\nReligious humanisms have not\nalways flourished and are subject to\nattacks from both fundamentalists and\nscientific secularists. They need\nconstant updating and vigorous\nintellectual development. But at their\nbest, they make it possible for societies\nto maintain strong religious communities\nas well as integrating symbolic\numbrellas that protect the productive\ninteraction of the scientific disciplines\nwith the wider cultural and religious life.\n\nAn Example: The Agape, Caritas, and\nEros Debate\n\nFew words in the English\nlanguage have such a range of everyday\nmeanings and of serious philosophical\nand theological consideration as the\nword love. For this reason, it is an\nexcellent candidate for scientific\ninvestigation that has potential benefits\nfor religious practice and everyday life.\nAlthough some theologians have sought\nto create a sharp division between\n\nPage |33\n\n\"Christian love\" and all other forms of\nlove, the tradition of religious humanism\nproposes that science clarifies the\nworkings of love in human societies and\nreligion extends the scope of love\nbeyond its most immediate domain of\nkinship.\n\nThere are three major tensions in\ntheological discussions of Christian love.\nThey center around the two Greek words\nagape and eros and the Latin word\ncaritas. A famous book titled Agape\nand Eros (1953) written by the Swedish\ntheologian Anders Nygren traced the\ndebate through Christian history. °\nNygren believed that the truly normative\nand authentic understanding of Christian\nlove is found in the word agape, the\nGreek word used for Christian love in\nthe New Testament. It refers to a kind of\nself-giving, even self-sacrificial, love\nthat is only possible by the grace of God.\n'© Nygren was particularly interested in\narguing that Christian love did not build\non what the Greek philosophers called\neros. He claimed eros refers to the\nnatural desires of humans to have and\nunite with the goods of life. This\nincludes the goods of health, wealth,\naffiliation, and pleasure but it also\nincludes the higher goods of beauty and\ntruth. Nygren’s point, however, was\nthat Christian Jove does not build on or\nincorporate eros — the natural\naspirational strivings of humans. He\nbelieved he found this view of Christian\nlove in the New Testament (especially\nthe writing of the apostle Paul) and\nMartin Luther, the giant of the Protestant\nReformation.\n\nNygren was particularly\ninterested in dismantling the classical\nmedieval Roman Catholic view of\nChristian love that was often\nsummarized with the English word\ncharity or the Latin word caritas.
