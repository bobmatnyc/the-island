  "text": "and headed to my car with T.J in tow. For the rest of the night he was\noddly quiet and asked to be dropped off at his parent’s house, I was more\nthan obliged to do so. I couldn’t stand the sight of him let alone want to\nbe around him tonight. Being so revved up it didn’t yet dawn on me that\nsomething wasn’t right. The next morning I was woken up by an alerting\nphone call, | had the manager from the restaurant where I worked, on the\nother end screaming at me and asking where the money is. I sat up in bed,\ncompletely awake now, and asked him back, “What are you talking\nabout, what money?” His tone had calmed a bit and he could hear the\neamestly in my voice and explained his accusations “The tip jar was\nempty after you had left last night and there was over a hundred and fifty\ndollars in there, now it’s missing”. The answer hit me instantly and I got\na terrible knot in my stomach...T.J. When I left him at the bar not even\nthinking about the tip bowl to talk with the manager, he saw an\nopportunity to fund more drugs and he took it. That’s why he didn’t even\nwant to come back to my apartment last night. It was all too clear for me\nnow and I tried to explain to my manager about my boyfriend’s sickness\nand asked him to take the lost money out of my wages. “I have no choice\nbut to let you go and file a police report for the missing money”. I\ncouldn’t believe what I was hearing. How did things tum upside down so\nquickly? I exclaimed “Even though I’m paying you from my pocket for\nmoney I didn’t even steal and you’ve never even had any problems from\nme before?”. His apologies were short and icy, nothing that could be\ndone. I slammed down the receiver only to pick it up again to dial T.J’s\nparents house and to no surprise he hadn’t slept there last night and was\nnot able to be reached. J felt like I was in a bad dream I couldn’t wake up\nfrom and with no money to pay rent, eat, or even survive, | was back to\nthe drawing board.\n\nThe week passed without hearing from T.J, he was in hiding, for now.\nWhen the phone rang early one morning [ expected it to be him, instead it\nwas a surprise phone call from a familiar voice. Jeffrey decided to give\nme a call to invite me over to his Palm Beach mansion for some lunch\nand to catch up, it really was just his way of finding out if | was cleaned\nup and ready to come back to work for him. With my life in chaos once\nagain and having to borrow money off my parents for grocery food, I saw\na quick solution to my situation and was even convinced this is what I\nhad to do to take care of myself.\n\nHe greeted me at the door and led me inside. Ghislane was at her usual\nspot, her desk working away, and we headed past her with a quick wave\nand lip-synced a “Hello”, not wanting to disturb her important sounding\nphone call. She glanced up quickly and gave a brisk wave my way, then\nput her attention back to the computer. Once we were inside the poolside\ncabana, which was Jeffrey’s office, & gym, Jeffrey took a seat behind his\n\n85\n\n\\ Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFREO0$218\n\ndesk and told me to have a seat across from him. He took a sip of water\nfrom an already poured glass and asked if I'd like some. “Yes, Thank\nyou” My reply was short and polite, already just wanting to get this\nmeeting done and over with. His face was like steel and his expressions\nwere stern, I felt like a child in trouble sitting in the principles office.\n\nHe cut straight to the chase wanting to know “Are you on drugs\nanymore?” There was a moment’s pause as | took a deep breath and told\nhim the entire truth. “I got really depressed for awhile and coped with my\nemotions by blanketing them with mind-altering substances. Just smoking\najay to relax wasn’t good enough anymore. | needed to be high and\nflying to believe I was happy and dealing with all of life’s curveballs.\nSnorting things like coke and popping amphetamines replaced my\nsorrows with an overflow of endorphins, making it possible to keep up\nwith everything, until | would come down and the cycle just kept on\nrepeating itself”.\n\nHe listened to me continue to tell him about the good things that have\ncome from the break. Like my dog, yoga, and working at a restaurant,\nmaking lots of new friends but most of all, I got my smile back, without\nthe drugs this time. He was really happy to hear the upside of everything,\nbut there was one thing I was reluctant to tell him about. My recent\ntravail that T.J effortlessly caused at the restaurant where I was so happily\nemployed. As my manager had warned he had to file a police report\nstating that after I had left, the tips were gone, putting the blame solely on\nme.\n\nGiving Jeffrey a clear picture of the entire ordeal he exclaimed “What\nare you doing with this idiot Jenna, he is no good for you! I know you can\ndo better for yourself, why do you let him drag you down every time?”\nNodding my head in concurrence I went on to finish my epic drama. “T\nreceived a phone call from the PBCP asking me to come in about the\nmoney, I told them what happened over the phone but they still want me\nto come in. I don’t want to have a record for something I never did or\never would do!’ I put my face into my hands and covered the tears now\ntrickling down my cheeks. “I just can’t believe this is happening to me\nwhen everything has been going so uphill, now I’m out of work and in\ntrouble” I wiped my face and looked up at him “ What do I do?” Enabling\nhim as my mentor once again, his sly grin said it all. Jeffrey normally\nhated when girls made waves in any way and this one would be\nconsidered a tsunami but this time it worked to his favor. He wanted me\nto come back to work for him, continuing my massage studies and I\nneeded his help. In his eyes he was doing me a solid, which in return [\nwould have to scratch more than his back for. Taking his time to\ncontemplate what to respond back and what solution he could offer, |\nbegan to worry that maybe | shouldn’t have done this.\n\n86\n\nO Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUIFRE004219.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021187",
