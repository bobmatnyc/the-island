  "text": "Forget clockwork analogies; our brains are closer to a system of canals and locks, with\nsignals traveling like water from one state to another.\n\nAs I sit here typing, I’m actually seeking equilibrium states in an n-dimensional\ntopology of gradients. Take just one: heat. My body temperature is higher than the air\ntemperature, so I radiate heat, which must be replenished in my core. Even the bacteria\nin my digestive tract use sensors to measure sugar concentrations in the liquid around\nthem and whip their tail-like flagella to swim “upstream” where the sugar supply is\nrichest. The natural state of all systems is to flow to lower energy states, a process that is\nbroadly described by entropy (the tendency of things to go from ordered to disordered\nstates; all things will fall apart eventually, including the universe itself).\n\nBut how do you explain more complex behavior, such as our ability to make\ndecisions? The answer is just more gradient descent.\n\nOur Brains\n\nAs miraculous and inscrutable as our human intelligence is, science is coming around to\nthe view that our brains operate the same way as any other complex system with layers\nand feedback loops, all pursuing what we mathematically call “optimization functions”\nbut you could just as well call “flowing downhill” in some sense.\n\nThe essence of intelligence is learning, and we do that by correlating inputs with\npositive or negatives scores (rewards or punishment). So, for a baby, “this sound” (your\nmother’s voice) is associated with other learned connections to your mother, such as food\nor comfort. Likewise, “this muscle motion brings my thumb closer to my mouth.” Over\ntime and trial and error, the brain’s neural network reinforces those connections.\nMeanwhile “this muscle motion does not bring my thumb close to my mouth” is a\nnegative correlation, and the brain will weaken those connections.\n\nHowever, this is too simplistic. The limits of gradient descent constitute the so-\ncalled local-minima problem (or local-maxima problem, if you’re doing a gradient\nascent). If you are walking in a mountainous region and want to get home, always\nwalking downhill will most likely get you to the next valley but not necessarily over the\nother mountains that lie around it and between you and home. For that, you need either a\nmental model (i.e., a map) of the topology so you know where to ascend to get out of the\nvalley, or you need to switch between gradient descent and random walks so you can\nbounce your way out of the region.\n\nWhich 1s, in fact, exactly what the mosquito does in following my scent: It\ndescends when it’s in my plume and random-walks when it has lost the trail or hit an\nobstacle.\n\nAl\nSo that’s nature. What about computers? Traditional software doesn’t work that way—it\nfollows deterministic trees of hard logic: “If this, do that.” But software that interacts\nwith the physical world tends to work more /ike the physical world. That means dealing\nwith noisy inputs (sensors or human behavior) and providing probabilistic, not\ndeterministic, results. And that, in turn, means more gradient descent.\n\nAI software is the best example of this, especially the kinds of AI that use\nartificial neural-network models (including convolutional, or “deep,” neural networks of\nmany layers). In these, a typical process consists of “training” them by showing them\n\n105\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016325",
