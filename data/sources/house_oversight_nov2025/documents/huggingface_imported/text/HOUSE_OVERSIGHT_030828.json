  "text": "almost inevitable. Subsequently, the conflict in Syria is dramatically impacting its\nneighboring countries. More than a million of refugees from Syria have fled to\n\nJordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq.\n\nSome critics, looking at the turmoil in Syria, Egypt, Lybia, claim that the warm Arab\nspring has turned into a cold winter. Tunisia, for example, the first of the Arab\ncountries to overthrow their dictatorship, is on the edge of another civil war after\ntwo political assassinations. It might take years until the situation in Syria stabilizes,\ndecades until the country turns into a genuine and a true democracy. If Americans\nare to learn from their mistakes in Iraq and Libya, military intervention is off the\ntable. To stop Syria’s turmoil, the United States needs a new strategy aimed at\npressuring both sides into negotiating. Syrian conflict cannot be resolved by military\nmethods. The only way to end the war is through political dialogue. Providing the\nrebels with weapons would only aggravate the situation and lead to more deaths\n\nand casualties.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030828",
