Villafana to J. Lefkowitz.\n\nThe following day, Ms. Villafana relayed that, and asked us to respond to, the very first\nconcern raised Mr. Ocariz, which was “how are they going to get paid” and whether\n“there is any cap or other limitation on attorney’s fees that [Epstein] will pay in the civil\ncase.” See Tab 30, September 27, 2007 Email from M. Villafana to J. Lefkowitz.\n\nMs. Villafana clearly contemplated that Mr. Epstein would be paying for Mr. Ocariz at\nhis “hourly rate” to represent the alleged “victims” against Epstein even “if all [the] girls\ndecide they want to sue.” Jd.\n\nWhen the defense complained of Ms. Villafana’s undisclosed conflict-of-interest in\nselecting her boyfriend’s friend to prosecute civil claims against Mr. Epstein on behalf of\nher undisclosed list of purported “victims,” Ms. Villafana later argued that Mr. Epstein\nhad no right to complain because “the Non-Prosecution Agreement vested the Office with\nthe exclusive right to select the attorney representative.” See Tab 18, December 13, 2007\nLetter from M. Villafana. Shortly after being notified, however, United States Attorney\nAcosta removed Mr. Ocariz from consideration, and requested an amendment to the Non\nProsecution Agreement.\n\nIn response to the many complaints about Ms. Villafana’s misconduct and violations of\nthe United States Attorney’s Manual, Criminal Division Chief Matthew Menchel\ncharacterized her as “unsupervisable.”\n\nContrary to the express agreement of United States Attorney Acosta that the federal\ngovernment would not interfere in the administration of any state sentence, FAUSA\nSloman continued to try to deny the right of the State to issue work release and/or gain\ntime by stating that Mr. Epstein must “make a binding recommendation that the Court\nimpose” a sentence of 18 months of continuous confinement in the county jail. See Tab\n21, September 24, 2007 Non Prosecution Agreement. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Sloman\nsent the FBI to meet with the state sex-crimes prosecutor in an attempt to secure her\ncommitment to oppose a work release option.\n\nFAUSA Sloman Attempts to Thwart Discovery\n\nOn October 31, Mr. Sloman emailed Mr. Epstein’s counsel, confirming that “I understand\nthat the plea and sentence will occur on or before the January 4th [2008] date.” See Tab\n41, October 31, 2007 Email from J. Sloman to J. Lefkowitz (emphasis added).\n\nOn November 5, despite Mr. Sloman’s having sent that email just one week before, after\nlearning that the defense had begun to question women on their “list,” Mr. Sloman wrote\nMr. Epstein’s attorneys demanding that his plea and sentencing in the State case now be\nmoved up to November 2007. See Tab 2, November 5, 2007 Letter from J. Sloman.\n\nMr. Sloman further demanded in the letter that Mr. Epstein’s attorneys “confirm that\nthere will be no further efforts to contact any victims” until the victims are represented by\ncounsel. Jd. As the women were all adults, there could be no lawful justification for Mr.\n\n7\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012166",
