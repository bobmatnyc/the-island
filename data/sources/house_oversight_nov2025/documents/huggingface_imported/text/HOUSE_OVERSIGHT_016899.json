  "text": "for interpreting images and text have resulted from developing good models for vision\nand language. Developing good models of people is the next frontier.\n\nOf course, understanding how human minds work isn’t just a way to make\ncomputers better at interacting with people. The trade-off between making mistakes and\nthinking too much that characterizes human cognition is a trade-off faced by any real-\nworld intelligent agent. Human beings are an amazing example of systems that act\nintelligently despite significant computational constraints. We’re quite good at\ndeveloping strategies that allow us to solve problems pretty well without working too\nhard. Understanding how we do this will be a step toward making computers work\nsmarter, not harder.\n\n96\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016899",
