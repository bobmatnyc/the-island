Those death pilots may have been\nzealous, but now the Americans know, and for the first time, what it\nmeans to be at the receiving end of power.\n\nVery few Arabs believed that the landscape all around them—the\ntyrannical states, the growing poverty, the destruction of what little\ngrace their old cities once possessed, the war across the generations\nbetween secular fathers and Islamist children—was the harvest of\ntheir own history. It was easier to believe that the Americans had\nwilled those outcomes.\n\nIn truth, in the decade prior to 9/11, America had paid the Arab world\nscant attention. We had taken a holiday from history's exertions. But\nthe Arabs had hung onto their belief that a willful America disposed\nof their fate. The Arab regimes possessed their own sources of power—\nfearsome security apparatuses, money in the oil states, official\ncustodians of religion who gave repression their seal of approval. But\nit was more convenient to trace the trail across the ocean, to the\nUnited States. Mohammed Atta, who led the death pilots, was a child\nof the Egyptian middle class, a lawyer's son, formed by the\ndisappointments of Egypt and its inequities. But there was little of\nhim said in Egypt. The official press looked away.\n\nThere was to be no way of getting politically conscious Arabs to\naccept responsibility for what had taken place on 9/11. Set aside\nthose steeped in conspiracy who thought that these attacks were the\nwork of Americans themselves, that thousands of Jews had not shown\nup at work in the Twin Towers on 9/11. The pathology that mattered\nwas that of otherwise reasonable men and women who were glad for\nAmerica's torment. The Americans had might, but were far away.\nNow the terrorism, like a magnet, drew them into Arab and Muslim\nlands. Now they were near, and they would be entangled in the great\ncivil war raging over the course of Arab and Muslim history.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025017",
