In reality both will evolve together.\n\n3.6 Postscript: Formalizing Pattern\n\nFinally, before winding up our very brief tour through patternist philosophy of mind, we will\nbriefly visit patternism’s more formal side. Many of the key aspects of patternism have been\nrigorously formalized. Here we give only a few very basic elements of the relevant mathematics,\nwhich will be used later on in the exposition of CogPrime. (Specifically, the formal definition of\npattern emerges in the CogPrime design in the definition of a fitness function for “pattern min-\ning” algorithms and Occam-based concept creation algorithms, and the definition of intensional\ninheritance within PLN.)\nWe give some definitions, drawn from Appendix 1 of [Goe06a];:\n\nDefinition 1 Given a metric space (M,d), and two functions c: M — [0,co| (the “simplicity\nmeasure”) and F: M —> M (the “production relationship”), we say that P © M is a pattern\nin X € M to the degree\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012969",
