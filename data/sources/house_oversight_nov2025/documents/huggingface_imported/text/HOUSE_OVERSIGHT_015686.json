  "text": "xii Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\ndecision was already made. As Daniel Dennett says, “You have no free\nwill. Get over it!” They say I am effectively an avatar in some giant cosmic\ncomputer game, going about my business in an entirely predefined way. I\ndo not agree! If they are right all the coincidences and chance actions of\nmy life were fixed at the time of the Big Bang. I feel this must be wrong,\nbut finding a chink in the determinist armor is hard work; the laws of\nphysics as we know them today are almost exclusively deterministic.\nThis book lays out the options — the chinks — that would allow free will\nto enter our Universe.\n\nTo understand human thinking we would really like to look inside\na working human brain. We can’t do this yet. All we can do is observe\nminds at work when they communicate with one another. If our minds\nthink non-computationally — as I believe — we should be able to see them\nstruggle when they have to translate thoughts into symbolic form. The\nmore symbolic, the harder it will be. This is indeed what we observe: face-\nto-face communication is easy, while formal written modes are much\nharder. We will explore the difference between human and computer\ncommunication as our first step in locating the weakness in the armor\nof determinism.\n\nWhat do I Believe?\n\nAs a scientist, I ought not to have beliefs. I should have theories and\nworking assumptions. But, as a human being, I must admit believing\ncertain things are true. Science does not forbid beliefs. It just requires\nyou to be prepared to have one overturned if a better one comes along.\nRichard Feynman summed this up in a lecture he delivered at Cal Tech:\n“If you want to discover a theorem,” he said, “first, you guess, then you\nwork out some effect predicted by the theorem. Finally, you see if the\neffect happens in the real world. If it does, you have a good theory. If the\neffect happens a little differently, you will need to look for a better theory.’\nHere are some of my overturn-able beliefs.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015686",
