  "text": "[9\n\nNobody has ever had to balance transformational and conservative\nroles on a global scale before.\n\nFrom an American point of view, the Arab Spring is just another\ncomplication of this global task — a sudden thunderstorm with\nflashes of lightening, driving rain and unpredictable gusts of wind as\nwe hop one-legged on the tightrope changing our pants. The Islamic\nworld is entering new territory as it struggles to integrate religious\nand liberal political values; as the United States tries to juggle its\ngeopolitical interests with its values at a volatile moment in world\nhistory, we are almost certain to get the balance wrong much of the\ntime.\n\nHere, however, history offers some hope. As I wrote at the beginning\nof this post, the United States has been doing two things for more\nthan 200 years: getting foreign revolutions wrong, but somehow still\npushing its global revolution forward. America’s success as a\nconservative revolutionary power on a global scale depends less on\nthe clever policies of our presidents and our secretaries of state, and\nmore on the creativity and dynamism of American society as a whole.\nIt is power of a free people more than the brilliance of our intellectual\nand social establishment that has brought the United States this far; in\nthat truth lies the secret of our revolution and of our success.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031894",
