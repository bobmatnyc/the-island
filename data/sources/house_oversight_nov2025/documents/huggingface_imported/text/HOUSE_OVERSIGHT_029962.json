It’s so\nfunny (to me — totally embarrassing to him)!!! Still like Trump and might be a delegate to the republican\n\nconvention.\n\nWas in St. Thomas for a couple of days — did call this island, but never heard back. Went scuba diving off St.\nJeff and it was beautiful. Would be totally funny (to me at least) if you put a big fake shark or statute under the\n\nwater where the divers go....\n\nLove ya,\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
