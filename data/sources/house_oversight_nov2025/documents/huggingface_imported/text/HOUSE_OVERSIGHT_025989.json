  "text": "Week in review (Europe)\n\nThe FTSE100 reached 13 months highs last week as the BOE exceeded market\nexpectations by announcing a 25 bp rate cut (its first rate cut in 7yrs}, a further £60bn\nof QE purchases (vs forecasted £50 bn) while also hinting at more potential stimulus in\nthe autumn. Unsurprisingly, GBPUSD fell further on the back of this. The better-than-\nexpected US nonfarm payrolls that beat all surveyed forecasts helped drive US markets\nto new all-time closing highs also helped European equities rebound from a mid-week\ntrough. As a result, the V2X has retraced close to its 11 month lows as foreseeable\ncatalysts are behind us for a potentially quieter end to the summer.\n\n« Long dated ESTX50 var term structure is historically elevated; vol term\nstructure is not: The dislocation of 3y var convexity (var strike/ATMf volatility)\nvs that of ly, which in itself is near extremes, is particularly striking\n\n- European issuance of ESTX50-linked structured products picked up in July:\nWe estimate issuance of ~€120Mn/day in July, which compares to €5Mn daily\nissuance in June and €55Mn daily issuance in 1H16 (excluding June).\n\n- The current vega outstanding in SX5E-linked products is €143Mnh, which is in\nits 97\" percentile since Jan-14 (when our records begin}. Moreover, this could\nrise to as much as €169Mn if the SX5E rallied to 3280.\n\nLong-dated ESTX50 var term structure is steep; vol term structure is not\n\nDespite a significantly steep longer dated ESTX50 variance term structure (vs its\naverage since 2008), the volatility term structure is nearly flat. As a result, the level of\nESTX50 long dated variance is historically elevated vs the level of long dated vol. The\ndislocation of 3y var convexity (varswap strike/ATMf vol ratio) vs 1y var convexity (which\nin itself is near its historic highs) is particularly striking.\n\nChart 21: Longer dated ESTX50 variance term structure is significantly Chart 22: ESTX50 variance convexity (varswap strike/ATMf vol ratio) is\nelevated vs long term average — the extreme steepness is not mirrored near extremes — the dislocation of 3y var convexity vs that of ly, which\nin the ATMf volatility term structure in itself is near extremes, is particularly striking\n30% 1.40 7 99.7 percentile\n28% 1.35 mwmmee er ee Se Se ee oe\n26% e\n1. 96.1 percentile 7\n24% ; tN a ae\n20\n22% 445\n20% 1.10\n18% 1.05\n1.00\n==O= = vol surface - Current === var surface - Current ; ;\n; ; m= SX5E 1y var convexity = ==\"SX5E 3y var convexity\n=== vol surface - Avg since 2008 ==@== var surface - Avg since 2008\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.
