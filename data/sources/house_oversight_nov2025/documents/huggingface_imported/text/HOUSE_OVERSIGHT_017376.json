If you never have a celebrity case during\nyour career, you haven’t missed anything.\n\n9. Clients whether civil or criminal, are increasingly brought to trial not only before a judge\nin robes and a jury of peers, but also in the “court of public opinion,” where every citizen\ngets to “cast a vote” on the legal and moral aspects of the case. For some clients in the\npublic eye—political figures, entertainers, business moguls, even ordinary citizens—the\n“verdict” rendered by the court of public opinion may be as important as the verdict of the\njury or court. But being aware of the importance of winning in the media is not enough.\nA good lawyer must be prepared to face the media, where the usual rules of evidence do\nnot prevail. A good “all purpose” lawyer must learn the very different “rules” of the court\nof public opinion and must develop the skills with which to win in that important forum as\nwell.\n\n10. Despite the often distorting effect of the media on the administration of justice, the press\nserves as an important check and balance on judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers.\nThe First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of the press, may sometimes be in\nconflict with other amendments designed to guarantee a fair trial. An appropriate balance,\ndifficult as it is to achieve, is essential to democratic governance.\n\n289\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017376",
