  "text": "Also included are several high priced special edition items made\nfor VIP’s such as a beautiful Taj Mahal leather jacket and a Taj\nMahal Golf Bag and Clubs as well as a 1994 Trump Castle Casino\nBirthday Invitation titled, “Trump, Lord Of The Financial Jungle.”\n\nThe centerpiece of the installation is a sizable portrait of Donald\nTrump taken by Andres Serrano in 2004 for his “America” series\nand a giant rotating sculpture below it. The sculpture, which is\nmore than 10 feet tall, is the word, EGO, spelled vertically, an\nelegant sign that once greeted visitors at the entrance of Trump’s\nTaj Mahal Casino's Ego Lounge.\n\nFinally, there are several board games including “Trump\nMonopoly,” “The Apprentice Game” and “Trump: The Game.”\n\nThe premise of “The Game” is stated on the box.\n\n“It's not whether you win or lose, its’ whether you win.”\n\nThere are different versions of “The Game,” including one in\nFrench, all to be laid out in several locations in the gallery under\nglass.\n\nWhat kind of game was it, or 1s it? Who wins, and who loses?\n\nThat’s for the audience to decide. The artist prefers to stay neutral.\n\n“It’s a portrait of a man painted with his own brushes,” says\nAndres Serrano.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018705",
