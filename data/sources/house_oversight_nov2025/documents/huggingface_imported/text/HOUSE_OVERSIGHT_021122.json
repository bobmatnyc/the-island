Here was a volatile and uncertain\npresident, releasing, almost on a daily basis, his strange furies on the world,\nand, at the same time, on his own staff. This first phase of the most abnor-\nmal White House in American history ended in August 2017, with the\ndeparture of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and the appointment of\nretired general John Kelly as chief of staff.\n\nThis new account begins in February 2018 at the outset of Trumps\nsecond year in office, with the situation now profoundly altered. The pres-\nident’s capricious furies have been met by an increasingly organized and\nmethodical institutional response. The wheels of justice are inexorably\nturning against him. In many ways, his own government, even his own\nWhite House, has begun to turn on him. Virtually every power center left\nof the far-right wing has deemed him unfit. Even some among his own\nbase find him undependable, hopelessly distracted, and in over his head.\nNever before has a president been under such concerted attack with such\na limited capacity to defend himself.\n\nHis enemies surround him, dedicated to bringing him down.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021122",
