  "text": "does not make me their relationship therapist, and it doesn't make me best friends with\nhis other girlfriends (or boyfriends, for that matter). I am responsible for what I do, but\nI'm not responsible for what he does. I am responsible for how I treat his spouse, but I\ncan't be responsible for how he treats his spouse.\n\nBut what if I'm already friends with someone, and one of my partners gets involved with\nthat person? Do I have special responsibilities in that case? I'm still figuring that one out.\n\n2. When is it actually the best time to start talking about polyamory and setting out\nrelationship definitions? My approach so far has been to put poly on the table during\ninitial conversations, and then talk about it more when the topic of the relationship comes\nup. But I've been thinking lately that I probably should go into more detail sooner,\nbecause people have such different stereotypes of open relationships that I can't be sure\nthey're on board with what I'm talking about unless we've discussed polyamory in-depth.\n\nI feel like I talk to a lot of people who think they want a supposedly \"polyamorous”\nrelationship because they see it as a no-strings-attached free-for-all, and that's definitely\nnot what I want. Or I talk to people who back away from polyamory for the same reason.\nI see polyamory as being about more commitment to relationship negotiation, not less. I\nsee it as being about setting individual boundaries, if necessary -- it's not about having no\nboundaries. I see it as being about creating a secure situation for all parties involved --\nnot making anyone insecure, or ignoring anyone's needs. And being polyamorous doesn't\nmake my relationships unimportant to me. Being in love doesn't seem at odds with\npolyamory for me.\n\nThis is a hard thing to communicate in a small dose, though, especially if I'm dealing\nwith someone who has minimal exposure to the concept. On the other hand, having a\nSerious Conversation about polyamory on the first date is a bit much.\n\n3. Is it a good idea for me to get involved with guys who ultimately want\nmonogamy? As I noted earlier, I might compromise to monogamy eventually, but poly is\na priority for me. (Who knows, maybe I'll decide it's my ideal relationship formation\nagain someday. This seems unlikely to me right now, but anything's possible.)\n\nBut what if I get really into a guy who ultimately plans to be monogamous? Is this a bad\ncall on my part? On the one hand, if I go on a few dates with a 28-year-old guy who\ndoesn't want to get married until his mid-30s but definitely wants a monogamous\nmarriage when he does... I mean, why not have a relationship? On the other hand, I may\nbe setting myself up for heartbreak in such situations, if he basically sees our relationship\nas \"not real” from the start. This brings me to my next point...\n\n4. Some people see polyamory as a sign of commitment-phobia. I've made this\nmistake myself -- in fact, the \"polyamory as commitment-phobia\" stereotype is so strong\nthat I've occasionally reversed it and wondered if my desire for it was a sign of\ncommitment-phobia. But the fact is, my appreciation for polyamory only increased as I\nbecame more certain about what I'm seeking in a partner, and as I gained more\nunderstanding of how to negotiate that. It's come along with relationship confidence and\nunderstanding.\n\nI feel pretty okay with believing in commitment in the context of polyamory. But my\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018607",
