Perhaps particles are composed\nof sub-particles that cause the weird quantum effects we see.\n\nWe have discovered sub-particles — quarks and the like — but more\nthan a hundred years of experimentation have gradually ruled out any\nform of theory explaining how these random events can be governed\nby the properties of the particle. The collapse of the wave function just\nseems to happen randomly.\n\nThere is one explanation for quantum mechanics that avoids\nthe measurement problem altogether but it is even stranger than the\nCopenhagen interpretation: ‘the many worlds’ view. The idea was first\nput forward by Hugh Everett in 1957, and it claims measurements are\nnever made, there is never a collapse of the wave function, and every\nwave continues to exist. We just can't see them all. There is a version of\nme that has seen a live cat and another in a parallel universe that saw a\ndead one. The two versions of me are also in superposition, just like the\ncat, so there are an infinity of parallel universes tracking every possible\noption.\n\nThe only measurable consequence of this ‘many worlds’ idea is the\nexistence of enormously enjoyable science fiction plots and much poking\nof fun between the many worlds camp, and the no-many-worlds camp.\nThe single-worlds proponents point out the whole idea is untestable and\njust plain odd. For example, each choice we make, every reflection and\nany quantum process generates a new branch in the Universe. This is a\nvast amount of information to track and puts us back in a position where\nmoral choices have no consequence. Every decision I make spawns a\nUniverse where I made a different choice.\n\nFor a humorous take on this, you can visit a website and buy your\nown Universe for $2.99. You pose a question based on the throw of a die,\nlet’s say, one to three I go to work today and, four to six, I take a sick day.\nThe website generates a quantum random number using an experimental\nsetup at a laboratory in California. You can make your choice based on\nthis quantum random number in the certain knowledge that another\nUniverse springs into existence where you made the alternate choice, so\nsomewhere you are not taking a sick day after all, and can be found hard\nat work at your desk.\n\nThere is one more explanation for quantum measurement, proposed\nby Roger Penrose. He proposes gravity comes to the rescue. Once enough\nparticles are involved in the superposition of states, the curvature in\nspace time becomes great enough to force a measurement event. In\nhis view, a measuring instrument is simply an amplifier which brings a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016018",
