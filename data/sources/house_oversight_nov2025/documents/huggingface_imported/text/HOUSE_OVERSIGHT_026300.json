  "text": "e This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would\nstart off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is\njust too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 months until the next presidential\nelection. We can’t beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics,\nsports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must\nstart out in striking distance in any three-way poll against Trump and a fill-in-the-blank\nDemocratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine\n\nirrelevance otherwise.\n\ne A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone\nwith a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral\nvotes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida,\nPennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put\nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral\nsweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary\nchallenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won’t be\ncleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states\n\nwould be off the table entirely.\n\ne With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side\nof entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely\nStephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily\ncomedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald’s\nacross the country. A few of the “Saturday Night Live” script writers could certainly be enticed to\ndisguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near\ndaily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep\nthe voters’ attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing\naccess to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of\n\nvoters in the months leading up to the general election.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026300",
