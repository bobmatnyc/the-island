As a result, the cultural\nfocus moved from a focus on the social\ngroup — the family, neighborhood, or\nsociety — toward the autonomous\nindividual.\n\nForty years ago, the dominant\nmetaphor for the human mind was the\ndigital computer, complete with inputs,\nfiling and memory systems, limited\nprocessing resources, and outputs.\nEvolutionary theory focused on the\nselfish gene and, by extension, on the\nindividual whose purpose for living was\nto survive long enough to reproduce.\nMilton Friedman influenced economic\ntheory and government policies for\ndecades by positing that people, being\nfundamentally rational, are motivated\nfirst and foremost by self interests, and\nthe adage of “united we stand, divided\nwe fall” was supplanted by the notion\nthat what is best for the me is best for the\nsociety. Moving from an economy\nbased on manufacturing for the masses\nto one based on catering to idiosyncratic\nconsumer interests further fueled a focus\non the preferences of the autonomous\nindividual.\n\nOne can certainly find evidence\nin humans and other species for the view\nof life being best understood in terms of\nself-interest. Sardines, for example,\nswim in what appears to be synchronized\nschools until approached by a predator,\nat which time they dart about so\nchaotically that they create what appears\n\nPage |19\n\nto be a large, tumultuous ball with a\nmind of its own. The rule governing the\nbehavior of this dynamic and adaptive\ncollective action can be explained\nentirely in terms of self-interests. Each\nfish is driven to swim to the middle,\nwhere it is less likely to be eaten by the\nhungry predator. Sardines are born with\nthe capacity to swim, find food, and\navoid predators. If they survive long\nenough to reproduce, their genes will be\npart of the gene pool for future\ngenerations. That is, if those who are\ngenetically predisposed to swim to the\nmiddle are more likely to survive\npredation, then the genetic\npredisposition to swim to the middle will\nbecome a characteristic of a larger\npercentage of sardines in future\ngenerations.\n\nThe sardine ball is an example of\na more general phenomenon, in which\nthe choices made by members of a group\nendow the collective with properties that\nare consistent, predictable, and\npurposive enough that we can speak of\nthem as “behaviors” of the group, even\nthough the collective actions of the\ngroup are not directed by any of the\nindividual members. This phenomenon\ncan be called “emergent,” because the\nproperties or behavior of the group are\nnot determined by any individual but\narises from the collective behaviors of\nthe individuals who constitute the group.\nSocial structures like the sardine ball\nhave evolved because the sardines\nwhose genes compelled them to swim to\nthe middle in the presence of predators\nwere more likely to survive to\nreproduce, thereby contributing these\ngenes to this species’ gene pool.\n\nAccording to the National\nScience Foundation’s Tree of Life\nproject, there are anywhere between 5\nmillion and 100 million species on\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021265",
