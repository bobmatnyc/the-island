Now divide by total acceleration to reach the\n\ncounterparts of (4.5) and (4.5a).\nI will sometimes save space, from now on, by expressing these arguments in the\nequations of Chapter 4, as for example in leaving the words “total” and “pure”\n\nimplicit if the context shows that I mean them.\n\nThe Slave Paradox\n\nSay that Phil enslaves Bill. Bill’s maintenance consumption had been taste-satisfying\npure consumption to Bill when Bill was free, and so was not deducted from his pay\nto find his gross realized output as valued by himself.
