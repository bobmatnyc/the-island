Acosta was U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at\nthe time. Alan Diaz\n\nInstead, Epstein — whose friends included President Donald Trump, former\nPresident Bill Clinton and other politically connected people — was allowed to\nquietly plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court. He served 13 months in\nthe county jail, where he was allowed liberal work release privileges rarely given to\nsex offenders in Florida and barred by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Department’s own\nrules.\n\nHe was released in 2009, but his victims — who were 13 to 16 years old at the time —\nare still fighting more than a decade later to have his non-prosecution agreement\noverturned.\n\nIn his op-ed, Sloman called Acosta “an outstanding public servant ... at risk of\nbecoming collateral damage in Washington’s latest polarized conflagration,” adding,\n“I won't let it happen without first being heard.”\n\nJeffrey Epstein apologizes, but not to his victims\n\nJeffrey Epstein, a multimillionaire who molested dozens of underage girls, and is\nsuspected of trafficking countless other girls around the world, issued a public\napology Tuesday.
