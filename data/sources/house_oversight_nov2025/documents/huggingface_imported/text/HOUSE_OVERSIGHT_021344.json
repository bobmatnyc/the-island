  "text": "precedent found in courts around the\nworld dating back to the Middle Ages.\nIn times past and cultures in which\npeople did not so naturally restrict\nintentional capacities to other humans,\nanimals (such as rats) and objects (such\nas “possessed” statues) were common\ntargets of criminal prosecution'®\"”,\nIncreasing the extent to which other\nagents seem mindful also increases the\npraise or blame that they receive for\ntheir actions. And even diminishing the\nextent to which people feel in mindful\ncontrol of their own behavior (e.g., by\nundermining people’s belief in free will),\nleads people to behave in ways that are\nconsistent with diminished self-control\n(such as by cheating on an exam when\ntempted to do so).'*\n\nSecond, other minds are capable\nof thinking, and may therefore be\nthinking about you. Being under\nscrutiny by mindful agents has two basic\neffects on human behavior. One is that\nmindful agents become sources of social\ninfluence, increasing the extent to which\npeople behave in socially desirable\nways’. Imagine, for instance, how you\nmight behave if you found a magic ring\nthat made you invisible... and you'll get\nthe point. This ability for mindful\nsurveillance to control behavior has been\nproposed as one of the reasons, if not the\nprimary reason, why religious systems\nthat posit an omnipresent deity are able\nto maintain such large-scale cooperative\nsocieties. The other effect of mindful\nsurveillance is that it is mentally taxing\nto monitor others’ thoughts. This\neffortful monitoring can diminish a\nperson’s performance on other\ncognitively demanding tasks”. And\nwhile waiting for a stressful event, such\nas giving a speech, people show less\nstress-related responses when in the\npresence of their relatively mindless pet\n\nPage |98\n\nthan when in the presence of their\nrelatively more mindful spouse”.\n\nFinally, other minds matter\nbecause mindful agents become moral\nagents worthy of care and compassion’.\nThe principle of autonomy captures this\nmost basic of human rights—that\nbecause all people have the same\nminimal capacity to suffer, deliberate,\nand choose, no person can compromise\nthe body, life, or freedom of another\nperson. Agents with mindful\nexperience, the capacity to suffer,\ndeliberate, and choose, become those\nthat evoke empathy and concern for well\nbeing, whereas agents without mindful\nexperience can be treated simply as\nmindless objects. From debates about\nabortion to animal rights to euthanasia,\nthe mindful experience of the agents in\nquestion is often either the explicit or\nimplicit focus of debate. Making\ninvisible minds visible, and hence more\nlike one’s own, enables people to more\nreadily follow the most famous of all\nethical dictates—to treat others as you\nwould have others treat you.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is impossible for scientists to\nexamine whether God was looking out\nfor the passengers of flight 1549 or\npunishing the residents of New Orleans\nwith Hurricane Katrina, but it is very\npossible to examine why people might\nmake such inferences. These\nexaminations have revealed a\nremarkable capacity to look beyond the\nvisible behavior that the environment\nprovides to reason about a completely\ninvisible world of intentions and goals,\nof motives and beliefs, of attitudes and\npreferences—an invisible world of other\nminds. Understanding when people are\nlikely to recognize other minds (and see\ninto them) and when they are not is the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021344",
