Even so, the PA remained highly dependent on U.S. aid,\nreceiving more than $400 million per year from Washington, and it\nwas unclear whether the PA and its president, Fatah leader Mahmoud\nAbbas, could survive without it.\n\nAs a result, the U.S. Congress responded to Hamas’ 2006 electoral\nvictory by passing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act (PATA), which\nconditioned assistance to the PA on a presidential certification that\nHamas did not effectively control any “ministry, agency, or\ninstrumentality” of the PA and made “demonstrable progress” toward\nfive benchmarks related to transparency, democratization, and\nantiterrorism. PATA provided a national security waiver that allowed\nthe White House to continue funding various entities in the PA\npresidential office and judiciary branch, so long as Hamas did not\ncontrol the recipient. It also permitted funding to nongovernmental\norganizations that provide aid to the West Bank and Gaza relating to\nhumanitarian needs and democracy promotion.\n\nUltimately, the dilemma over funding the PA resolved itself in 2007,\nwhen Hamas broke with Fatah and the PA and took control of Gaza.\nThis separation freed OFAC to allow all transactions with the Fatah-\ncontrolled PA in the West Bank. But should Hamas rejoin the PA as\na result of the recent unity arrangement, there may be pressure on\nOFAC to take a tougher stance. Indeed, in recent appropriations bills,\nCongress has made assistance to a “power-sharing government” in\nPalestine contingent on compliance with PATA.\n\nCongressional authorization to fund a Hamas-affiliated PA would\nlikely overcome existing legal prohibitions. In the face of PATA,\nhowever, there is a substantial risk that providing aid without specific\ncongressional authority would violate U.S. criminal laws. Although\nthere are several arguments for exempting the PA from the U.S. laws\nagainst dealing with FTOs, none is particularly convincing.
