  "text": "understanding. These discontinuous and global transformations are the stuff of\nmiracles, especially for physicists. Even with respect to initial and end-states, rather\nthan using straight forward phenomenological observation, the mathematical and\nphysical theories of phase transitions are usually dependent on not necessarily\nintuitive, derivative physical quantities. Their verbal representations are often not\nconcrete but metaphoric. This retreat to derived and abstract, far from the primary\ndata computables, may be more evidence of man’s many insufficiencies in\n\nunderstanding of the mysteries that are often placed in the spiritual realm.\n\nDriven by an effect that contributes to cause, like the faith-driven\nabandonment to God that generates more faith, a drop of water hanging from a\nfaucet is pulled down by its own gravitational field as the thinning neck of the drop\nfacilitates its own further thinning. A gobbet connected by a thick neck to the main\ndrop begins to separate. The neck between them thins and breaks, and one\nbecomes suddenly and irreversibly two. A continuous structure has suddenly\nbecome discontinuous in finite time at what is called a singularity. Since the single\nmeasurable feature that dominates the water’s behavior around this singularity is\nthe diameter of the thinning neck, a derivative physical, one-dimensional\nobservable, neither the details about where it all began (called the initial conditions)\nnor the path it followed to get to the moment of fracture, are predictively relevant\nwith respect to the sudden transition. Considering this kind of phenomenon going on\nin our brains, choosing between theories of behavior that involve changes in brain\ncell groups and/or brain chemicals versus those that involve behavioral quantities,\nmay be neither possible nor necessary. The challenge is to place the problems of\ncataclysmic change in brain and behavior in sufficiently abstract and universal terms\nthat can be represented in some low dimensional, computationally accessible space\nof variables.\n\nThe simplification and stereotypy of behavior around singularities reduce the\n\nnumber of features that are required to discuss the dynamics of change in what\n\n131\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013631",
