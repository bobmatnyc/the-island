Dear Jeffrey,

Since your last meeting in Paris and the meeting on site I have had no news from you. I would
just like to know if you intend to go ahead with the interior design work because Florence is
blocked and waiting. If you want to do it and since about ~70-80-90% of the project is
approved then why don’t we start with what is sure and for the remaining points, such as the
kitchen, we can see about these the next time you are in Paris.

As for the kitchen I understand new samples were sent yesterday. These samples are in grey
which is not a very bright color for a beach house kitchen where perhaps blue might be more
appropriate. Let’s see.

If you would like us to do the project we will send you a budget recap for the points agreed
upon along with our first account and fees.

Big kisses,
