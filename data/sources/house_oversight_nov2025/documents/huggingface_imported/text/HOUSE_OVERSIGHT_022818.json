We would be looking for on record comments or a \"no comment\" to our\nquestions. But | am certainly happy to have an off record conversation with yourself as well. Perhaps we\ncould set up a time to chat briefly off record on Monday before | send you our questions for Mr Epstein?\n\nKind regards,\nMatt\n\nOn 11 August 2018 at 11:08, Martin G.
