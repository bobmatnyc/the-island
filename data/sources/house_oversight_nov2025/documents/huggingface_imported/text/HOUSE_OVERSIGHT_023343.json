Alan\n\nPeas\nEPI Er\n\nSubject:\nTo: Melanie Spinel as\n\nLeon,\n\nYesterday , | again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and\nyou and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing\nthe things that I don;t have the time to do.\n\nIn order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be\nhelpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per\nyear. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories ,\n\na desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. _, planes.\nboats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800\npage tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers,\nhome mgmt.,vast multitude of Ilc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead\nof less that 3. million dollars.\n\nI have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights\n. I wrote itto you over a year ago.

I am torn, as my very strong\ninclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many\nthat will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people\ninvolved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my\ninvolvement ) Iam also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the\ncomplexities who else can do it? problem.\n\nYour family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking with\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023343",
