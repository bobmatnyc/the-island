Ghislaine Maxwell?\n\n| know from the court filings and hearing transcripts, that Mr. Epstein was deposed in this action, but was not\nexpected to be called as a live trial witness.\n\nAccording to the transcripts - it was represented by plaintiff’s counsel during pre-trial hearings, that Mr.\nEpstein invoked his 5“ amendment rights and declined to answer substantive questions during the\ndeposition. It also appears that Judge Sweet had not yet made a final determination as to whether Mr.\nEpstein’s depo, or selected portions thereof, would be admitted at trial (which is obviously a moot point,\nnow).\n\nIf you believe any of that to be in error, and/or if you wish to provide a statement about the settlement or in\nresponse to Giuffre’s allegations about your client, please give me a call or reply to this email.\n\nIf you have no comment, I’d appreciate you letting me know that.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022941",
