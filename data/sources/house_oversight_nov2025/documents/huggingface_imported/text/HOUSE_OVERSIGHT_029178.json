  "text": "RLK: Well some people would say that tariffs\nhave at least got China’s attention. Even some\nleading people tell me privately in China that in\nthat sense China needs to move faster in doing\nthings like opening markets, like intellectual\nproperty protection. Now they are doing some\nthings. They have an intellectual property\ncourt. I visited it in Shanghai a few months\nago. It’s working really well. Much more\nprogress needs to be done. So in that sense the\ntariffs are a beacon that tells everybody we\nneed to deal because everybody is going to\nsuffer by tariffs. The question is how we deal\nwith it.\n\nChina needs to make some specific changes\nregarding markets, IPR, some of these other\nthings — they should be done subtlety and not\npublicly. That’s the way to get things done.\n\nHOST: Isee. You know, President Trump has\ninfamously said that trade wars are good and\nthey're easy to win. And you wrote about this,\nwhy the Chinese don’t think that the U.S. could\never win a trade war with Beijing. It was a\nvery long list but tell us the highlights of that.\n\nRLK: Right — in the early days of the so-called\ntrade war, the Chinese media and Chinese\nexperts were talking very frequently about how\nthe U.S. can’t win.\n\nRobert Law rrence Kuhn Chairman, The Kuhn Foundation\n\nRecord-breaking temperatures leave 29 dead in S. Korean heatwave\n\nMay bump 10% to 25% tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods\n Ottcom Trump also thanks North Korea's Kim for “very nice letter\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029178",
