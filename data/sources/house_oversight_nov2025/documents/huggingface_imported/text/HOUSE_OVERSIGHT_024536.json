Junior Mezzanine debt is recorded at face value.

The growth stems from\nKLC PropCo’s reinvestment of excess cash flow in additional real estate and rent increases in the\nproperties leased to KLC OpCo as described below:\n\nIntercompany Rent. KLC PropCo currently leases 847 properties (845 childcare centers) to KLC for a\ntotal annual rent payment of $96.3 million. The rent on the properties is fixed for the first five years of the\nlease, at which point it increases by the lesser of the CPI growth over the five years or 7%.\n\nAdditional Real Estate. KLC PropCo has projected that it will invest all excess cash (anything over $5.0\nmillion) in additional real estate. The additional real estate may be comprised of either educational or\n\nnon-educational assets, but will not be leased back to KLC OpCo. KLC PropCo has projected that it will\ninvest its capital at an 8.25% cap rate.\n\n103\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024536",
