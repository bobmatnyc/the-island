  "text": "[9\n\nNobody and no amount of external assistance can help the Syrian\nprotesters overcome their differences (as a Lebanese citizen, trust me\non this one). But the sooner they speak with one voice, organize their\nranks from within, and show the world that they are a mature and\ncapable group able to turn Syria into a responsible democracy, the\ncloser they will be to fulfilling their dream of toppling the Assad\nregime.\n\nTheir unity and organization are indeed more powerful than NATO’s\nbombs and more effective than the West’s sanctions. The lessons of\nLibya, Egypt, and Tunisia are clear: With unity comes historic\nopportunity.\n\nBilal Y. Saab is a visiting fellow at the James Martin Center for\n\nNonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International\nStudies.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031931",
