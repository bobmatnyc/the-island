  "text": "The human motivation for social\nconnection extends beyond the boundary\nof the human in the (often\nmisunderstood) religious language of\nanthropomorphism. In this chapter, an\ninfamous sermon from colonial\nAmerica—‘Sinners in the Hands of an\nAngry God’—1s used to illustrate the\nway anthropomorphic language works to\nincorporate human society in a web of\nethical obligations that connect to the\nnatural environment and, by imaginative\nextension, to the universe as a whole.\n\nPersonifications of God\n\n12. How Does God Become Real\nBecoming a person of faith is not so\nmuch about acquiring certain beliefs\nbut about learning to use one’s mind\nin particular ways; the often intensely\nprivate experience of God is built\nthrough a profoundly social learning\nprocess.\n\nBelief and Connection\n\n13. Theological Perspectives on God as\n\nan Invisible Force\nThe beliefs that religious individuals\nhold about the way God operates in\nhuman life are potential factors affecting\nperceived social isolation. My paper\ndiscusses a specific type of such belief\nthat is common in the history of\nChristian thought: the belief that God 1s\nan invisible force of a rather impersonal\nsort working for the good in everything\nthat happens. The paper argues that this\nsort of belief has as great or greater\npotential than belief in God as a personal\nfriend to give one the sense that one is\nnever alone, but the conception of God\nas pervasive can also lead to inattention\nand disconnection.\n\nThe Elusiveness of Meaningful\nConnection\n\n14. Visible Efforts to Change Invisible\nConnections\n\nDespite the human need for social\nconnection, many individuals are lonely\nbecause they are unable to create\nmeaningful social bonds. Interventions\ndesigned to reduce loneliness have not\nbeen successful, suggesting that a better\nunderstanding of loneliness, social\nconnection, and the obstacles to forming\nmeaningful connections with others is\nneeded.\n\nReflections on Invisible Connections\n\n15. Social Brain, Spiritual Medicine?\n\nScience and religion are mextricably\nintertwined in the practice of medicine.\nScience has provided modern medicine\nwith extraordinary diagnostic and\ntherapeutic capacities that can be\nemployed to care for patients. Religions\nprovide a fuller vision for the worthiness\nof caring for the sick, a framework to\nguide the application of medical science\nin that endeavor, and practices that\nstrengthen the human capacity for\ntreating patients as the mindful persons\nthey are.\n\nInvisible Forces\n\n16. Epilogue\n\nInvisible forces that connect individuals\nto society, or to each other, have effects\nat both ends of the connection. As\nhumans we are fundamentally individual\nand fundamentally social. We\nencompass both the pursuit of rational\nself interest of Homo economicus and the\npursuit of approval, belonging, and\nintimacy of Homo socialis, the former\ngrounded in eros, the latter in agape.\nThese forces acting together represent a\nsignature feature of Homo sapiens (the\nwise ones) and have contributed a record\nof influence and impact— both positive\nand negative —that is unmatched in\nbiology.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021250",
