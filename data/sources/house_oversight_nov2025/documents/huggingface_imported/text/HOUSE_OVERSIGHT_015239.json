  "text": "1986 it was the turn of the Presidio. The San Francisco Police investigated,\nverified that my wife and | had been three thousand miles away in\nWashington, D.C.—where | was on duty every single day [that the alleged\nvictim] was at the day-care center September 1st to October 31st,\n1986—and closed the case with no charges accordingly.\n“In October 1988, however, | appeared as a panelist on a Gera/do\nRivera Halloween Special. Rivera was trying to aggravate and escalate the\n‘Satanic Ritual Abuse’ witch-hunt mania, and | was speaking out against\nit. The broadcast came to the attention of Senator Jesse Helms who\nbecame enraged that a Lt. Colonel in the Army should dare to hold a\n‘Satanic’ religion. As Freedom of information filings later revealed,\nHelms then secretly contacted his close personal friend, Secretary of the\nArmy John Marsh, and insisted that Marsh devise some way to destroy my\ncareer.\n“What was actually taking place: a blatant attempt by Senator\nHelms, Secretary of the Army Marsh and the Criminal Investigation\nDivision of the Army to discredit an Army officer with a ‘politically\n\nincorrect’ religion. It didn’ t work.”\n\nzk k *\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015239",
