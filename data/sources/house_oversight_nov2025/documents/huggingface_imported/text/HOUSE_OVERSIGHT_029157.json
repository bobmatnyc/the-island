  "text": "RECOMBINGATION? OF COURSE NOT. BUT THAT WOULD A TRULY DARWINIAN\nSYSTEM...\n\nINCIDENTALLY CANCER DOES EVOLVE IN US BUT IT IS A ONE-GENERATION\nWONDER, BEING ONLY PASSED ON IN ONLY A COUPLE OF SPECIES OF THE DOG\nFAMILY (where it has become a sexually transmitted disease). INOURSELVES IT\nEVOLVES GENETICALLY IN ONE LIFETIME AND WE KNOW THE UNITS THAT ARE\nSELECTED FOR. PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE AN ALMOST INFINITE VARIETY OF\nCANCERS AND AS WE LEARN TO TREAT ONE, OTHERS COME TO THE FORE.\n\nNONSENSE—THE AUTHORS ARE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT PSYCHOPATHIiC\nBEHAVIOR BUT RATHER ‘AGGRESSIVE AND ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR’\n\nTRUMP IS NOT THE PERFECT MATE BUT IS HE REALLY A ‘LOUSY FATHER’?—ASK\nHIS CHILDREN, IVANKA, DONALD JR ETC—THEY SURE DON’T ACT LIKE THEY\nHATE HIM. HOW ABOUT VICTIMS OF HINDU AND MUSLIM HONOR KILLINGS WHO\nARE ‘ASSASSINATED’ ‘WITH THE ASSENT OF THEIR FAMILIES’—ARE THE VICTIMS\nPSYCHOPATHS OR ARE THEIR KILLERS? FOR THE EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS OF\nHONOR KILLINGS—SEE BELOW. NOTE THAT CULTURAL PEOPLE HAVE OFFERED\nLITTLE OR NOTHING OF VALUE ON THIS SUBJECT BUT EVOLUTINARY GENETICS\nAT ONCE SUGGESTS AN INTERESTING AND VERY STRONG EFFECT.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029157",
