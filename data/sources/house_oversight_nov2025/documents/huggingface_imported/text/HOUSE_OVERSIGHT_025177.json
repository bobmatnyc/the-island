What's been stimulating as a source of good questions for the \"distributions in nature\" issue?\n\n7. \"Signal intelligence in biol. systems\" seems to cover all of neurophysiology: Jonathan Victor, whom\nyou met a few years ago in your office, is powerfully thoughtful on the issues of neural coding. Are there\nspecific examples that have stimulated you to better questions or turned your thinking around?\n\n6. Are you aware of apps that purport to play music to enhance productivity and focus on tasks at hand?\nMy buddy Reese Jones has backed that; he has a fascinating set of beliefs and projects around what may\nsoon be understood as \"consciousness hacking.\" He's on the board of Singularity University as one of the\nfounders. (His father was a pioneer UCSF MD researcher of hallucinogens, I believe!)\n\nMore to come in a day or so.\n\nThanks!\n\nYou're up late or you're not so east of my SF location!\nDavid\n\nPS How to trade the Trump-GOP demolition of the welfare state, erratic elevation of risks of trade\ndisruptions and war? Has anyone from the rational center or left given thought to how to respond to a\nnational emergency to cope with a kakistocratic seizure of emergency powers? The Patriot Act was on a\n‘shelf as you know, ready to be used.
