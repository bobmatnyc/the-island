Would he be available to answer any of these on the\nphone or by email? People have told me some of his thoughts on background but I wanted to see if he could\ntell me or email me anything directly I could use on the record. Also I'd like to run the information I already\nhave by you or him.\n\nThank you,\nAlexandra\n\n-What is he chiefly focusing on now? Is he spending more time on The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation?\nCould he talk about his interest in science and the 2011 grants/conference?\n\n-How has his business been affected? Is there any new direction he's taking it? Does he still have the same\nclients or new ones? Is it still at $15 billion?\n\n-Did he still work while in prison? How was that arranged? With whom was he working/advising?\n-Where is he spending his time now? How has his social life changed from three years ago?\n\n-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell?\n\n-What were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions to his conviction?\n\n-What does he think about the sentence he got- was it too lenient or too harsh and why?\n\n-What is his side of the story and have people been supportive?\n\n-Is he continuing the charity initiatives he started with Bill Clinton, etc?\n\n----- Original Message-----\n\nFrom: Jay Lefkowitz [mail i i i 7 i iii’\n\nSent: Mon 3/7/2011 12:18 PM\nTo: Wolfe, Alexandra\nSubject:\n\nDear Ms. Wolfe,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031983",
