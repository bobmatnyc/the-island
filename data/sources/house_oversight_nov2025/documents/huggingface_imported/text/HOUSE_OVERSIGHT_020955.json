Rising from 19% of revenue in 1965 to 33% of revenue\nin 2005 — of which 75% was spent on healthcare — takes its toll on other\nareas of spending / growth. There are serious tradeoffs - every dollar that\ngoes to entitlement programs is not spent on education, infrastructure, and\ndefense.\n\n2) Why have corporate income taxes fallen to 13% of revenue in 2009 from\n22% in 1965 aside from recession? How crucial has this been to maintain\nglobal competitive advantage and stimulating American job and GDP\ngrowth?\n\nNote: All data are inflation adjusted using GDP price index from BEA; 05 vs. 40-yr variance is rounded.\n\nKP Data source: White House Office of Management & Budget.\n(@E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 228\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020955",
