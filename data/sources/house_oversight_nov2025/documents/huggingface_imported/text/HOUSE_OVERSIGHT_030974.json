Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and Trump's \nperceived A -level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money \nlaunderers. What's more, Trump's own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain \nbillionaire lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle \nschemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the Mueller investigation \nappeared to be finding. \nIn November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later caught in a scandal \ninvolving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, \nFlorida for $36 million—a house that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and \nTrump had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, \nwith Trump always hopeful that Epstein would provide some of his financial expertise to \nenabvle h8im to survive. Trump was beholden to Deutsch Bank and was on the hook \npersonally for 40 million dollars. \nEpstein took Trump to see the Palm Beach house to advise him on construction issues \ninvolved with moving the swimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the \nhouse, an incredulous Epstein saw a severely cash-constrained Trump bid $41 million for \nthe property, buying it through an entity named Trump Properties LLC, ultimate owner \nunknown.. Trump, Epstein knew, had been in the buisness of leasing his name. Hotels are \nactually owned by others but renting the trump name would cost a percent or two. , \nTrump was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the actual ownership in a real estate \ntransaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of Trump's basic business model of \nlicensing his name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furious Epstein \nsuspected that others actually owned the new house. then getting extensive scrutiny in \nFlorida papers. The disagreement re the purchase of the house became all the more bitter \nwhen, two months later, the house was put on the market for $125 million. Well known to \nTrump, who often visited with Epstein at his Palm Beach house, whose visits were \nconfirmed in depostions of Epsteins houseman. It appears that Epstein was visited almost \nevery day, by and had been for many years, by girls who he paid for massages with happy \nendings—girls recruited, and who often returned to his house from the local massage \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030974 \nparlors strip clubs, and, also, Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Just as the threats and enmity of the \ntwo friends increased over the house sale, Epstein found himself under investigation by \nlocal Palm Beach police. Epstein's legal problems vastly escalated but the new Trump \nproperty, with only minor improvements, was bought 3 years later in 08 , the time \nTrump was facing his huge debt. for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev. a Russain oligarch. \nThat is, Trump had either miraculously earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or \nRybolovlev, or someone such as Rybolovlev, paid Trump Properties, LLC—actual owner \nunknown—$96 million, thereby providing a clean payment of $55 million to \nsomeone. This at the very same time that trump was into Deutsch bank for over 600 \nmillion dollars but with a 40 millino personal guarnatee .Rybolovlev might have, in effect, \npaid himself for the house, thereby cleansing the money. Epstein, on his part, would be \nsenetenced to 30 months, 12 of those months in jail on a prostitution charge. \nAfter the election, when Bannon was introduced to Epstein, Bannon told him, \"You were \nthe one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign.\" \n\"not surprising\" said Epstein. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
