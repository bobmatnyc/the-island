That's it. Mr. Trump has NEVER \nbeen accused of having any involvement or even having any knowledge of any of Mr. \nEpstein's conduct by anyone,\" Garten wrote. \n\"As a result, I have no idea what the purpose of your article could possibly be other than to \ntry and intentionally and with actual malice defame my client's name and reputation by \nmentioning him in the same article as Mr. Epstein. In other words, suggest guilt by \nassociation. This is the very definition of irresponsible and reckless journalism and to publish \nsuch a story would be highly unethical - even by buzzfeed's standards.\" \nOn Tue, Dec 8, 2015 at 4:53 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nhawain tropic girl \nlauren petrella \nOn Tue, Dec 8, 2015 at 5:50 PM, Landon Thomas Jr. wrote: \nYes!!! \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Dec 8, 2015, at 4:43 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nwould you like photso of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen. \nOn Tue, Dec 8, 2015 at 5:41 PM, Thomas Jr., Landon_________________________wrote: \nNow everyone coming to me thinking I have juicy info on you and Trump. \nBecause of this. \n\"I've known Jeff for fifteen years.
