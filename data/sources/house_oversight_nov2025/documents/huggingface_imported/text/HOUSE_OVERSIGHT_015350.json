  "text": "sperm because it’ s a good source of protein, something that’ s often\nlacking when meat is removed from the diet.\n\nFinally--and this could possibly be an urban legend--in a biology\nclass at Harvard University, a professor was discussing the high glucose\nlevels found in semen which give the spermatozoa all that energy for their\njourney. A female freshman raised her hand and asked, “If | understand\nyou correctly, you’ re saying there is a lot of glucose, as in sugar, in\nsemen?”\n\n“That’ s correct,” replied the professor.\n\nThe student asked, “Then why doesn’ t it taste sweet?”\n\n“It doesn’ t taste sweet,” he answered as she realized what her\nquestion implied. She blushed, picked up her books and headed for the\ndoor, as he continued, “because the taste buds for sweetness are on the\n\ntip of your tongue and not the back of your throat. Have a good day.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015350",
