  "text": "though... or threatening... or frustrating, like in my example above. It's complicated!\n\nHowever, I often see those dynamics play out in ways that the participants won't admit,\nno matter how much evidence comes up. I think it gets especially complicated when\npeople experience jealousy as a sexual thing, a turn-on. Most people have a hard enough\ntime discussing their sexuality in the first place. When you add an ingredient as\ncontroversial as jealousy, the potential discussions become that much more combustible.\n\nWhen I was researching pickup artists for my awesome book Confessions of a Pickup\nArtist Chaser, I found a number of discussions in that community that praise competitive\nfeelings because they're seen as making the relationship more fun. A lot of these guys say\ncompetition among different lovers within open relationships is awesome because it\nkeeps everyone a little uncertain, and encourages them to be \"on top of their game.\" This\ncontrasts drastically with most polyamorous perspectives; in my experience, poly folks\nsee jealousy and competition as things that should be compartmentalized and managed\nvery carefully, rather than encouraged or exalted. For polyamory theorists, a feeling of\nsafety is often the goal, as opposed to a feeling of competition.\n\nAnd emotional safety is certainly a concern, because jealousy is one of the most intense\nand overwhelming emotions out there. It's such a hard feeling to sit with and work\nthrough. My worst experiences of jealousy felt like I was choking, like I couldn't breathe,\nlike I was sick to my stomach, like I was terribly obsessed, like I couldn't think of\nanything but the jealousy and how much it hurt. And yet... I've occasionally felt jealousy\nthat was weak, almost nice, where I felt a little twinge of it and turned to my lover and\ngot reassured... and that made me feel more safe, more cared for, more loved.\n\nThe bottom line is that people experience jealousy and competitive urges in many\ndifferent ways. It's important to acknowledge that and honor it. I don't see it as\nproductive to frame things like \"jealousy is bad,\" or \"competition is awesome.” I'd much\nrather frame things like: \"Jealousy and competition happen sometimes, and how do\nwe deal with them when they come up so that everyone involved feels comfortable\nand happy?\"\n\nKK ok\n\nThe Toolkit\n\nI firmly believe that the primary tools for dealing with jealousy and competitive\nurges are honesty, good faith and respect. If you're feeling jealous, then take a deep\nbreath. (I'm pretty sure that most relationship drama could be avoided if more people took\ndeep breaths.) Hopefully, you're dating someone who you like and trust (if you're not,\nwhat's the point?). Remind yourself that this person, who you like and trust, probably is\noperating in good faith and isn't trying to hurt you. Respect that this person has their own\ndesires, which won't always overlap perfectly with your own. Don't assume that your\npartner is obliged to do everything you want -- but do be honest about what's hurting you,\nso you can work it out together.\n\nAnd, in turn: if your partner is jealous, respect that emotion. Remind yourself that this\nperson, who you like and trust, probably is operating in good faith and isn't trying to\ncontrol you. Be honest about how your partner's jealousy makes you feel, and think about\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018641",
