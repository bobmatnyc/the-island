  "text": "In the case of loneliness interventions,\nall of the reviews essentially confirmed\nthe findings of previous reviews that\nsocial skills training and group-based\ninterventions can succeed in reducing\nloneliness. Is this conclusion justified, or\nis this a case in which prior conclusions\nhave been perpetuated in the manner\nKuhn describes?\n\nTo combat bias favoring results\nthat confirm dominant theories, some\nscientists have argued that specific study\ncriteria should be met to warrant an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the\nintervention (18). These criteria include\nrandom assignment of study participants\nto receive the intervention, evidence that\nthe intervention is more effective than no\nintervention, findings that are replicated\nby at least one independent research\ngroup, and results that are published in\npeer-reviewed journals. Previous\nreviewers of loneliness interventions\nhave, in fact, placed a premium on\nrandomized trials that contrast a group\nrandomly selected to receive the\nintervention with a group randomly\nselected to receive no intervention.\nHowever, none has employed meta-\nanalysis, a quantitative technique for\ncalculating the average effect of diverse\ninterventions designed to accomplish the\nsame goal. Whereas qualitative reviews\nare subjective and vulnerable to\nconfirmatory biases, quantitative reviews\nare objective and relatively impervious\nto bias as long as all relevant studies are\nincluded in the analysis.\n\nTo minimize bias in our meta-\nanalysis, we first combed the literature\nto identify all the intervention studies\nthat specifically targeted loneliness. To\nfurther meet our criteria for inclusion in\nthe meta-analysis, studies had to be\npublished in a peer-reviewed journal or\nas a doctoral dissertation (to ensure the\n\n133\n\nPage\n\nscientific integrity of the findings),\nbetween 1970 and 2009 (to include and\nextend the time interval reviewed\nqualitatively in prior research), and had\nto measure loneliness quantitatively.\n\nFifty-two intervention studies for\nloneliness met our inclusion criteria.\nThese studies were divided into three\ncategories based on the experimental\ndesign used to assess the effects of the\nintervention. Twelve studies used a\nsingle group pre-post design in which\nloneliness among participants was\nassessed at baseline and again after\nexposure to the intervention. The single\npre-post design is weak in terms of\nmeasuring the effectiveness of an\nintervention, however, because\nindividuals who have high scores on a\nloneliness measure on one occasion are\nlikely to score less extremely on a\nsecond occasion even if no intervention\nhad occurred. Said differently, people\nwhose measurements suggest they are\nvery lonely at one point in time, on\naverage, appear to be less lonely when\nmeasured at a later point in time. Our\nmeta-analysis of these studies indicated\nthere was indeed a lowering of\nloneliness as measured before and after\nthe interventions, but we cannot\nconclude from this evidence that the\nreductions in loneliness were due to the\ninterventions.\n\nEighteen studies utilized a non-\nrandomized group comparison design in\nwhich some of the participants sought\nout the intervention (the experimental\ngroup) while others (the control group)\ndid not. In this design, assignment of\nindividuals to the experimental or\ncontrol groups was based upon\nconvenience, participant preference, or\nsome other factor, which means the\ngroups that did and did not receive the\nintervention may differ in ways that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021379",
