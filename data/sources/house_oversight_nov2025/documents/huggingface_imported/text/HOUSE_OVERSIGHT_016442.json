  "text": "Kellen, had called many of the girls. Epstein’s flight logs showed that the calls\nwere made when Epstein was in Palm Beach.\n\nThey obtained dozens of message pads from his home that read like a who’s who\nof famous people, including magician David Copperfield and Donald Trump, an\n\nindication of Epstein’s vast circle of influential friends. There were also messages\nfrom girls, and their phone numbers matched those of many of the girls Recarey\n\nhad interviewed, Recarey said. They read: “Courtney called, she can come at 4,\nor “Tanya can’t come at 7 p.m. tomorrow because she has soccer practice.”\n\nThey also found naked photographs of underage girls in Epstein’s closet, Recarey\nsaid.\n\nThere were also witnesses: Two of Epstein’s butlers gave Recarey sworn\ninterviews, confirming that young girls had been coming and going at the house.\nOne of the butlers, Alfredo Rodriguez, told Recarey that when he was tasked with\ncleaning up the master bath after Epstein’s sessions with the girls, he often\ndiscovered sex toys. Once, he accidentally stumbled on a high school girl, whom\nhe identified, sleeping naked in Epstein’s spa, he testified in a 2009 court\ndeposition.\n\nRodriguez said he was given the job of paying the girls, telling Recarey that he\nwas “a human ATM machine” because he was ordered by Epstein to keep $2,000\non him at all times. He was also assigned to buy the girls gifts. Rodriguez gave\nRecarey copies of pages from a book that Epstein and his staff kept with the\nnames and phone numbers for many of the Palm Beach County girls, Recarey\nsaid.\n\nRodriguez, however, held onto the bulk of Epstein’s “little black book,” and in\nNovember 2009 tried to sell it for $50,000 to an undercover FBI agent posing as\na victim’s lawyer. He was arrested and sentenced in 2012 to federal prison, and\ndied three years later following an illness. The book — listing personal phone\nnumbers for a cavalcade of Epstein’s powerful friends and celebrities — eventually\nbecame public as part of a civil lawsuit. It listed more than 100 female names\nand phone numbers under the headings “massage’’ in every city where Epstein\nhad homes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016442",
