  "text": "ring was actually sanctioned, and they could target children like myself\nwho were so horribly abused that they would be used in child\npornography. When my father was caught sending this pornography\nthrough the mail, Gerald Ford approached and told him that he could\nreceive immunity from prosecution if he would sell me into the project. My\nfather eagerly agreed. He was so happy that the government actually\ncondoned child abuse that he went on to have five more children to raise\nfor the project, so there were seven of us in all. He was never prosecuted\nand remains free for reasons of national security.”\n\nAt the age of 13, she met the man “who would become my\nowner” —Senator Robert Byrd. In 7rance Formation, she describes their\nfirst meeting:\n\n“| undressed and climbed into his bed as ordered. | was\nmomentarily relieved to find that his penis was abnormally tiny—so small\nit didn’ t even hurt! And | could breathe with it in my mouth! Then he\nbegan to indulge himself in his brutal perversions, talking on and on about\nhow | was ‘made just for him’ due to the vast amounts of pain | could\nwithstand. The spankings and police handcuffs | had previously endured\nwere child’ s play compared to Senator Byrd’ s near-death tortures. The\n\nhundreds of scars on my body still show today.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015229",
