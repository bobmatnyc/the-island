  "text": "weaponry and intelligence — Defense Minister Ehud Barak told CNN on Monday, “I should tell you honestly\nthat this administration under President Obama is doing in regard to our security more than anything that I can\nremember in the past.”\n\nWhile Romney had time for a $50,000-a-plate breakfast with American Jewish donors in Jerusalem, with\nAdelson at his elbow, he did not have two hours to go to Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, to meet\nwith its president, Mahmoud Abbas, or to share publicly any ideas on how he would advance the peace process.\nHe did have time, though, to point out to his Jewish hosts that Israelis are clearly more culturally entrepreneurial\nthan Palestinians. Israel today is an amazing beehive of innovation — thanks, in part, to an influx of Russian\nbrainpower, massive U.S. aid and smart policies. It’s something Jews should be proud of. But had Romney gone\nto Ramallah he would have seen a Palestinian beehive of entrepreneurship, too, albeit small, but not bad for a\npeople living under occupation. Palestinian business talent also built the Persian Gulf states. In short, Romney\ndidn’t know what he was talking about.\n\nOn peace, the Palestinians’ diplomacy has been a fractured mess, and I still don’t know if they can be a partner\nfor a secure two-state deal with even the most liberal Israeli government. But I do know this: It is in Israel’s\noverwhelming interest to test, test and have the U.S. keep testing creative ideas for a two-state solution. That is\nwhat a real U.S. friend would promise to do. Otherwise, Israel could be doomed to become a kind of apartheid\nSouth Africa.\n\nAnd here is what I also know: The three U.S. statesmen who have done the most to make Israel more secure and\naccepted in the region all told blunt truths to every Israeli or Arab leader: Jimmy Carter, who helped forge a\nlasting peace between Israel and Egypt; Henry Kissinger, who built the post-1973 war disengagement\nagreements with Syria, Israel and Egypt; and James Baker, who engineered the Madrid peace conference. All of\nthem knew that to make progress in this region you have to get in the face of both sides. They both need the\nexcuse at times that “the Americans made me do it,” because their own politics are too knotted to move on their\nown.\n\nSo how about all you U.S. politicians — Republicans and Democrats — stop feeding off this conflict for\npolitical gain. Stop using this conflict as a backdrop for campaign photo-ops and fund-raisers. Stop making\nthings even worse by telling the most hard-line Israelis everything that they want to hear, just to grovel for\nJewish votes and money, while blatantly ignoring the other side. There are real lives at stake out there. If you’re\nnot going to do something constructive, stay away. They can make enough trouble for themselves on their own.\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031707",
