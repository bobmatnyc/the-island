She is a\nfriend of Ghislaine’s but she was a real bitch to me.\n\n\"She was very fake. She turned away from me when we were introduced by Ghislaine and Jeffrey.\n\n‘Donald Trump was aiso a good friend of Jeffrey's. He didn’t partake in sex with any of us but he\nflirted with me. He'd laugh and tell Jeffrey, “You've got the life.” '\n\nPalm Beach Police say Epstein seemed utterly unfazed by the allegations against him when they\nbegan their long and detailed investigation.\n\n‘Jeffrey's craw: Middle East peace envoy George Mitchell, right, pictured with President Barack Obama and\n\nBut he also took his defence very seriously indeed. Epstein engaged his friend, the Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershowitz — whose celebrity clients have included Mike Tyson, Patty Hearst, Claus\nvon Bulow and O.J. Simpson ~ to run his legal defence.\n\nHe aiso employed a firm of private investigators to investigate the backgrounds of the girls.\n\nDetectives painstakingly built a case which they believed showed that Epstein systematically paid\nteenage girls to recruit other teenage girls to his sex ring.\n\nHowever, as the investigation continued, they found that Epstein’s team had already spoken to key\nwitnesses, suggesting that the financier would reward those who helped him.\n\nIn addition, Epstein's defence team agreed to the unusual move of suggesting that the alleged\nvictims sue Epstein in the civil courts. The result was a plea bargain in which Epstein admitted a\nsingle charge of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution ~ a deal which infuriated many police\nofficers who worked on the case.\n\nMore than 20 of Epstein’s girls are said to have sued him for damages. At least 17 have settled out\nof court.\n\nMr Clinton, Mr Gore and Mr Mitchell were all contacted about their friendship with Epstein but\ndeclined to comment.\n\nShare or comment on this article\n\nhitp:/Avww.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1363452/Bill-Clinton- 15-year-old-masseuse-|-met-twice-claims-Epsteins-girl html\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, frequently visited Epsteings New York residence, Virginia also claims\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 539-2 Filed 01/06/17 Page5of5\nCase 1:15 Gyo 7ahehs RWS oC yercerraerin 2 Hie sGicer pings BG I/9:6!
