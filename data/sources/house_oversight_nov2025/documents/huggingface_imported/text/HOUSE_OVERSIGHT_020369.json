It applies not only to documents but to the secret knowledge that such a source is\nable to recall and includes both controlled and uncontrolled bearers of secrets. It is also a job\ndescription that fitted Edward Snowden in June 2013.\n\nUnless one is willing to believe that the Putin regime acted out of purely altruistic motives in\nexfiltrating this American intelligence worker to Moscow, the only plausible explanation for its\nactions in Hong Kong was that it valued Snowden’s potential as an espionage source.\n\nSnowden’s open disillusionment with the NSA presented the very situation that the Russian\nintelligence services specialized in exploiting. He had also revealed to reporters in Hong Kong\nthat he had deliberately gained access to the NSA’s sources and methods and he that he had taken\nto Hong Kong highly-classified documents. He further disclosed that, before leaving the NSA, he\nhad gained access to the lists of computers that the NSA had penetrated in foreign countries. He\neven went so far as to describe to these journalists the secrets that he had taken as a “single point\nof failure” for the NSA. And aside from the documents he had copied, he claimed, it will be\nrecalled, that he had secret knowledge in his head that, if disclosed would wreak havoc on the\nentire U.S. foreign intelligence system. “If I were providing information that I know, that’s in\nmy head, to some foreign government, the US intelligence community would ... see sources go\ndark that were previously productive, he told the editor of the Guardian in Moscow.\n\nIn short, he advertised possessing precisely the priceless data that the Russian intelligence\nservices had been seeking, with little success, for the past six decades. These electronic files could\nprovide it with the keys to unlock the NSA’s entire kingdom of electronic spying. Could any\nworld-class intelligence service ignore such a prize? To miss the opportunity to gets in hands such\na potential espionage source would be nothing short of gross negligence.\n\nIn fact, as has been already established in these pages, this golden opportunity was not missed in\nHong Kong. Even if the Russian intelligence service had not previously had him in its sights —\nwhich, as discussed in chapter XV, appears to me to be extremely unlikely-- he made contact with\nRussian officials in Hong Kong, and Putin, as he himself said, personally approved allowing\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020369",
