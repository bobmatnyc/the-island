  "text": "Case No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 9 of 15\n\nwhich might otherwise apply to a defamation claim for statements made during the course of a judicial\nproceeding did not bar a malicious prosecution claim.\n\nIn light of the implicit recognition by the Supreme Court in Levin that a claim of malicious\nprosecution is not barred by the litigation privilege — an implicit recognition acknowledged by the Third\nDistrict itself — Epstein’s reliance on Wolfe is misplaced. Wo/fe is also factually distinguishable from\nEdwards’ claims against Epstein. Wolfe involved a malicious prosecution action against attorneys.\nSeparate policy considerations might serve to impose additional limitations on the assertion of malicious\nprosecution claims against attorneys — against whom alternative remedies exist such as bar disciplinary\nproceedings. See Taylor v. McNichols, 243 P.2d 642 (Idaho 2010). Moreover, in light of the decisions in\nWright v. Yurko, supra and Olson v. Johnson, supra, the weight of authority supports the proposition that\nthe litigation privilege would not apply to malicious prosecution claims.\n\nBoth the Third and Fourth Districts have applied the litigation privilege to abuse of process\nclaims. However, Wolfe itself, and the decisions of the Third and Fourth Districts cited in Wolfe,\ninvolved the litigation privilege as applied to claims of abuse of process by attorneys. None of the cases\ninvolved the extraordinary actions of an individual party like Epstein who carried out a course of action\nagainst Plaintiff's counsel with a singular purpose unrelated to any legitimate judicial goal. Under the\ncompelling facts of this case, where the actions of Epstein are coupled with the elements of malice and\nabsence of probable cause arising from the unfounded filing of the claims against Edwards, the litigation\nprivilege should not have any applicability to the abuse of process claim asserted by Edwards.\n\nThere are Disputed Issues of Fact Precluding Summary Judgment on the Abuse of Process Claim\n\nAn abuse of process claim requires pleading and proof of the following three elements: 1) that the\ndefendant made an illegal, improper or perverted use of process; 2) that the defendant had ulterior\nmotives or purposes in exercising such illegal, improper, or perverted use of process; and 3) that, as a\n\nresult of such action on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff suffered damage.” See S&J Invs. v. Payless\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013312",
