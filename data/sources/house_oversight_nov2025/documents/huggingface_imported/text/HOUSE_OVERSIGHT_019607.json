He complimented Snowden\nfor having “uncovered illegal acts by the United States around the\nglobe.” Putin’s defense of Snowden not only implied a global concept\nof whistle-blowing that justifies breaking U.S. laws but also pointed\nto America’s double standard in publicly complaining about Russian\nand Chinese cyber espionage.\n\nSnowden’s whistle-blower interpretation gained immense public\nresonance. Even after President Obama and leaders of both houses\nof Congress roundly denounced Snowden for betraying American\nsecrets, the majority of the public, according to a Quinnipiac poll\ntaken in July 2013, still considered “Snowden a whistleblower who\ndid a service revealing government domestic spying programs.”\nMoreover, Snowden’s revelations helped stoke a growing distrust of\nthe American government itself.
