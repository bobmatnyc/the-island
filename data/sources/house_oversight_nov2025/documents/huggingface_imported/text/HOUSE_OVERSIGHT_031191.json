  "text": "BE. May 20, 1997\n\nDonald Trump’s instincts regarding Jeffrey Epstein were solid. But if\nthe reporters who were beginning to look into Epstein’s mysterious\nbackground had dug a bit further, there’s a chance they would have hit\npay dirt as well—and not just in Palm Beach.\n\nIn California, for instance, a paper trail already stretched from the\nSanta Monica Police Department to Epstein’s front door.\n\nIn the spring—almost the summer—of 1997, a call came in to the\npolice. The young woman who placed it—a young actress who'd\nappeared on Baywatch and General Hospital—said she’d been sexually\nassaulted at a trendy hotel called Shutters on the Beach.\n\nThe officer who took the call knew the woman’s name——\nand her voice. A week earlier, she’d told him about an encounter with\nEpstein. The woman had not wanted to make a formal complaint at the\ntime. But she had taken the cop’s card, and now he was happy to hear\nthat she’d changed her mind.\n\nIn a shaky voice, {MM described Epstein as a tallish man—five feet\neleven or six feet in height was her guess—with gray hair and brown\neyes. He was the owner of a large black four-door Mercedes and was a\nregular at Shutters on the Beach, which was the kind of place that cost\none thousand dollars a night and was frequented by actors, agents, and\nother Hollywood types.\n\nGE old the cop that she was a model and actress herself. She’d\nknown Epstein for about a month. They had a friend in common, and\nshe’d sent him her head shots.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031191",
