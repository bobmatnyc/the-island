Starr \nTo Call Writer Directly: Facsimile: \n777 South Figueroa Street \nLos Angeles, California 90017 \nwww.kirkland.com \nJune 19, 2008 \nJohn Roth, Esq. \nPrincipal Associate Deputy Attorney General \nOffice of the Deputy Attorney General \nUnited States Department of Justice \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 4115 \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \nDear Mr. Roth: \nDir. Fax: \nI again want to thank you for this opportunity to explain why we believe that a federal \nprosecution of Jeffrey Epstein is unwarranted. I appreciate your having informed us that you \nalready have our May 19 and May 27 communications to the Deputy Attorney General, as well \nas our prior written submissions to CEOS and to the Southern District of Florida. \nIn light of the significant volume of our prior submissions and to facilitate your review, \nwe have drafted four supplemental submissions that will provide a roadmap for your \ninvestigation of this matter. Given the bulk of these documents and their appended supporting \nattachments, you will receive this packet by messenger tomorrow. A brief description of each of \nthe four submissions follows. First, I have included a succinct summary of the facts, law and \npolicy issues at hand. This document sets forth a basic overview of the issues and summarizes \nour principal contentions as to why federal prosecution of this matter is neither appropriate nor \nwarranted. \nThe three other submissions include: a summary of the irregularities and misconduct that \noccurred during the federal investigation; a letter from former CEOS attorney Stephanie Thacker \nthat responds to CEOS's assessment of its limited review of Mr. Epstein's case; and a point-by-\npoint rebuttal to First Assistant United States Attorney Jeffrey Sloman's recent letter which we \nbelieve contains factual inaccuracies typical of our correspondence from the United States \nAttorney's Office in Miami (the \"USAO\"). Also, for your reference, the package you receive \ntomorrow will contain a binder including all documentation to which we refer in our \nsubmissions. Finally, we will be providing a detailed checklist of each submission or substantive \ncommunication to the USAO. Our intention is that you have copies of each such document to \nenhance your review. If there are any that you have not received from the USA() or CEOS, \nplease advise and we will fedex them to you without delay. \nChicago Hong Kong London Munich New York San Francisco Washington, D.C. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012136 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nJohn Roth, Esq. \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 2 \nAs you are likely aware, the Department's prior review of this matter was incomplete \nand, by its own admission, not \"de novo.\" See Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from A. Oosterbaan. \nWithout considering the Non Prosecution Agreement that left this matter to be resolved in the \nState or any of the misconduct, CEOS reviewers, tasked with reviewing some of their own \npreviously expressed opinions, assessed only whether the United States Attorney would \"abuse \n[his] discretion\" if he pursued this case. While we appreciate CEOS 's willingness to examine \nthese limited issues, its conclusion that a prosecution would not be an \"abuse of discretion\" rings \nparticularly hollow in light of CEOS's admirably candid concessions that we have raised \n\"compelling\" objections and that a prosecution on these facts would require \"novel\" applications \nof federal law. Indeed, even a brief review of CEOS's own mission statement reveals how \ninapposite a federal prosecution is to the facts in this case. \nImportantly, we note that the CEOS review was conducted prior to the Supreme Court's \nvery recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar, which we believe—illuminating as they do the \nCourt's interpretive methodology when it comes to federal criminal law—powerfully \ndemonstrate the substantive vulnerability of the USAO's unprecedented employment of three \nfederal laws. That Office's interpretation would never pass muster under the Supreme Court's \nrecent pronouncements and should not be countenanced. That is all the more true under the \ncircumstances where the duly appointed U.S. Attorney opined that, in effect, the \"unitary\" \nExecutive Branch was driving this prosecution. We now know that is not so. \nWhat I respectfully request, and what I hope you will provide, is a truly \"de novo\" \nreview—that is, an independent assessment of whether federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is both \nnecessary and warranted in view of the legal and evidentiary hurdles that have been identified, \nthe existence of a State felony plea and sentence that have been advocated by the State Attorney \nfor Palm Beach County, and the many issues of prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness \nthat have permeated the investigation. I also request that you provide us with the opportunity \nduring your review to meet with you in person to answer any questions you may have and to \nelucidate some of the issues in our submission. \nWe believe that an independent review will confirm our strong belief that federal \nprosecutors would be required to stretch the plain meaning of each element of the enumerated \nstatutes, and then to combine these distorted elements in a tenuous chain, in order to convict Mr. \nEpstein. Indeed, just this week (and after two years of federal involvement in this matter), \nAssistant United States Attorney Villafana re-initiated the federal grand jury investigation—in \ndirect contravention of the parties' Non Prosecution Agreement—and issued yet another \nsubpoena seeking evidence in this case. See Tab 19, Subpoena to In the \nsubpoena, AUSA Villafana directs to appear on July 1, 2008 to give testimony \nand produce documents to FGJ 07-103 West Palm Beach. The attachment to the subpoena seeks \ndocuments such as photographs, emails, telephone billing information, and contact information \nthat relate to Mr. Epstein as well as specific other people who received protection from federal \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012137 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nJohn Roth, Esq. \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 3 \nprosecution as a result of Mr. Epstein's having entered into the September 24, 2007 Non \nProsecution Agreement with the USAO. \nNotably, the Non Prosecution Agreement contains the following agreed condition: \nFurther, upon execution of this agreement and a plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office, \nthe federal Grand Jury investigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury \nsubpoenas will be held in abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this \nagreement. The defendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to intervene and to \nquash certain grand jury subpoenas. \nSee Tab 21, September 24, 2007 Non Prosecution Agreement. It also guarantees that persons \nidentified in the Grand Jury subpoena such as , and Leslie Groff \nand others will not be prosecuted. The new Grand Jury subpoena clearly violates the Non-\nProsecution Agreement. Although Mr. Epstein has exercised his rights to appeal to the \nDepartment of Justice with the full consent and knowledge of the USAO, he has not breached the \nAgreement. The re-commencing of the Grand Jury is in violation of the Agreement. \nBut further, the new investigation, which features a wide-ranging, fishing-expedition type \nto search in New York does nothing to satisfy the very essential elements of federal statutes that \nare lacking despite the intensity of an over two-year investigation in the Palm Beach area. \nAbsent evidence of Internet luring, inducements while using the phone, travel for the purpose, \nfraud or coercion, the subject of the New York investigation is as lacking in the essential basis \nfor converting a state case into a federal case as is the remainder of the Florida investigation. \nThe reaching out to New York to fill the void emanating from the failures of the Florida \ninvestigation compellingly demonstrates the misuse of federal resources in an overzealous, over-\npersonalized, selective and extraordinary attempt to expand federal law to where it is has never \ngone. This last-ditch attempt by Ms. Villafana reinforces our belief that the USAO does not have \nfacts that, without distortion, would justify a prosecution of Mr. Epstein. \nIn view of the prosecution's often-verbalized desire to punish Mr. Epstein, we believe \nthat the prosecution summary suffers from critical inaccuracies and aggregates the expected \ntestimony of witnesses so as to reach a conclusion of guilt. Our contention is reinforced by the \nfact that key prosecution witnesses have provided evidence and testimony that directly \nundermines the prosecution's misleading and inaccurate summary of its case. Indeed, we now \nhave received statements from three of the principal accusers- __________________1(through a state \ncriminal deposition (through a• federal FBI-USAO sworn and transcribed \ninterview), and (through a defense—generated sworn transcribed interview). \nEach of these witnesses categorically denies each essential element that the prosecution will have \nto prove in order to convert this quintessential state-law case into a federal matter. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012138 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LL? \nJohn Roth, Esq. \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 4 \nIt thus is especially troubling that the USAO has not provided us with the transcript of \nMs. federal interview, nor the substance of the interviews with Ms. or Ms. \nnor any information generated by interviews with any of the approximately 40 alleged \nwitnesses that the prosecution claims it has identified. Because the information provided by \nthese women goes directly to the question of Mr. Epstein's guilt or innocence, it is classic Brady \ninformation. We understand that the U.S. Attorney might not want to disclose impeachment \ninformation about their witnesses prior to a charge or during plea negotiations. But we firmly \nbelieve that when the Government possesses information that goes directly to a target's factual \nguilt or innocence, the target should be informed about such heartland exculpatory evidence. \nMost importantly, aside from whether the Department believes Brady obligates \ndisclosure to a target of a federal investigation prior to the target's formal accusation, no such \nlimit should apply to a Department review. Accordingly, we request that you go beneath the face \nof any summary provided to you by the USAO and instead review the actual witness transcripts \nand FBI 302s, which are essential for you to be able to make a truly independent assessment of \nthe strength and wisdom of any federal prosecution. \nAfter careful consideration of the record, and as much as it pains me to say this, I simply \ndo not believe federal prosecutors would have been involved at all in this matter if not for Mr. \nEpstein's personal wealth and publicly-reported ties to former President Bill Clinton. A simple \nInternet search on Mr. Epstein reveals myriad articles and news stories about the former \nPresident's personal relationship with Mr. Epstein, including multi-page stories in New York \nMagazine and Vanity Fair. Mr. Epstein, in fact, only came to the public's attention a few years \nago when he and the former President traveled for a week to Africa (using Mr. Epstein's \nairplane)—a trip that received a great deal of press coverage. I cannot imagine that the USAO \never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein lacked this type of \nnotoriety. \nThat belief has been reinforced by the significant prosecutorial impropriety and \nmisconduct throughout the course of this matter. While we describe the majority of these \nirregularities in another submission, two instances are particularly troubling. First, the USAO \nauthorized the public disclosure of specific details of the open investigation to the New York \nTimes—including descriptions of the prosecution's theory of the case and specific terms of a plea \nnegotiation between the parties. Second, AUSA Villafana attempted to enrich friends and close \nacquaintances by bringing them business in connection with this matter. Specifically, she \nattempted to appoint a close personal friend of her live-in boyfriend to serve as an attorney-\nrepresentative for the women involved in this case. \nIt also bears mentioning that actions taken by FAUSA Sloman present an appearance of \nimpropriety that gives us cause for concern. Mr. Sloman's former law partner is currently \npursuing a handful of $50-million lawsuits against Mr. Epstein by some of the masseuses. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012139 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nJohn Roth, Esq. \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 5 \nFinally, as you know, Mr. Epstein and the USA° entered into an agreement that deferred \nprosecution to the State. In this regard, I simply note that the manner in which this agreement \nwas negotiated contrasts sharply with Mr. Sloman's current representation that \"[T]he SDFL \nindicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration . . . \" See Tab 1, May 19, \n2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 2. This statement is simply not true. Contrary to Mr. Sloman's \nassertion, federal prosecutors refused to accept what the State believed to be appropriate as to \nMr. Epstein's sentence and instead, insisted that Mr. Epstein be required serve a two-year term of \nimprisonment (which they later decreased to 18 months plus one year of house arrest). Federal \nprosecutors have not only involved themselves in what is quintessentially a state matter, but their \nactions have caused a critical appearance of impropriety that raises doubt as to their motivation \nfor investigating and prosecuting Mr. Epstein in the first place. \nAt bottom, we appreciate your willingness to review this matter with a fresh—and \nindependent—set of eyes. To facilitate your review, I once again request the opportunity to \nmake an oral presentation to supplement our written submissions, and we will promptly respond \nto any inquiries you may have. \ncc: Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012140 \nMAIN SUBMISSION \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012141 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nSUBMISSION TO THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL  \nIN THE MATTER OF JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN  \nJeffrey Epstein, a successful businessman and noted philanthropist with no prior criminal \nrecord, has been investigated for potential violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b) and 2423(b). \nSince the limited review conducted by CEOS, two Supreme Court decisions—one authored by \nJustice Scalia and the other by Justice Thomas—have revitalized the bedrock principles that \nfederal criminal statutes must be narrowly construed, that they may not be stretched to federalize \nconduct not clearly covered by their prohibitions, and that whenever there are two plausible \nconstructions of a criminal statute, the narrower construction (hich safeguards liberty) rather than \nthe broader construction (which expands the federal prosecutor's arsenal) controls under the \nvenerable rule of lenity. \nMr. Epstein's conduct—including his misconduct—falls within the heartland of historic \nstate police and prosecutorial powers. Absent a significant federal nexus, matters involving \nprostitution have always been treated as state-law crimes even when they involve minors. Mr. \nEpstein's conduct lacks any of the hallmarks that would convert this quintessential state crime \ninto a federal one under any of the statutes prosecutors are considering. \nMr. Epstein lived in Palm Beach, and his interstate travel was merely to go home. Any \nsexual conduct that occurred after he arrived was incidental to the purposes for his travel. Even \nCEOS admitted that applying § 2423(b) to a citizen traveling home would be \"novel.\" In fact, it \nwould be both unprecedented and in conflict with Supreme Court cases that have withstood the \ntest of time for over 60 years. \nMoreover, Mr. Epstein did not use the internet (either via email or chatrooms) to \ncommunicate with any of the witnesses in this investigation. Indeed, he did not use any other \nfacility of interstate commerce, including the phone, to knowingly persuade, entice, or induce \nanyone to visit his home—the \"local\" locus of all the incidents under investigation—much less \nto persuade, entice, or induce a known minor to engage in prohibited sex acts, as § 2422(b) \nrequires. Nor did anyone on his behalf \"persuade\" or \"induce\" or \"entice\" or \"coerce\" anyone as \nthese words are ordinarily understood and as the new Supreme Court decisions mandate they be \napplied: narrowly, without stretching ordinary usage to conform to a prosecutor's case-specific \nneed for a broad (and in this case unprecedented) application. In addition, as will be shown \nbelow, § 2422(b) requires that the object of the communication be a state law offense that \"can \nbe charged.\" Yet because the state of Florida's statute of limitations is one year for the first \nprostitution offense and three years for other targeted offenses, and because all or virtually all of \nthe offense conduct at issue in the federal investigation occurred prior to June 20, 2005, those \nacts can not be charged by the State, and thus cannot meet this essential element of federal law. \nFinally, Mr. Epstein neither coerced, nor enslaved, nor trafficked, nor derived any profit \nfrom his sexual conduct. He was an ordinary \"John,\" not a pimp. But § 1591 is directed only \nagainst those who engage in force or fraud or coercion or who are in the business of commercial \n1 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012142 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nsexual trafficking. The statute has never been applied to a \"John,\" and only a highly and \nimpermissibly selective prosecution could stretch § 1591 to reach conduct like that at issue in \nthis case. \nIn short, without \"novel\" interpretive expansions—a description used by CEOS itself—it \ncannot be shown that Mr. Epstein violated any of the three federal statutes identified by \nprosecutors. As the Supreme Court's recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar make clear, federal \nlaw may not be stretched in that manner, and the current federal investigation relies, as its \nfoundation, on impermissibly elastic stretches of each statute beyond any reported precedent; \nbeyond the essential elements of each statute; well outside the ordinary construction of each \nstatute's limitations; and on a selective, extraordinary, and unwarranted expansion of federal law \nto cover conduct that has always been exclusively within the core of state powers. \nAt this point in time, the need for Departmental oversight is critical. We appreciate this \nopportunity to submit our assessment of the key facts in this case and review of the pertinent \nfederal statutes, and respectfully request that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General end \nfederal involvement in this matter so that the State of Florida may resolve this case appropriately. \nSummary of the Facts \nMr. Epstein has maintained a home in Palm Beach, Florida for the past 20 years. While \nthere, he routinely conducted business, received medical attention, socialized with friends, and \nhelped care for his elderly mother. Mr. Epstein also had various women visit his home to \nperform massages. He did not personally schedule the massage appointments or communicate \nwith the women over the phone or the Internet. Rather, Mr. Epstein's personal assistants \nscheduled many types of appointments, personal trainers, chiropractors, business meetings and \nmassages. The phone message pad taken from his house and in the possession of the \ngovernment confirmed that in many cases, the women themselves contacted Mr. Epstein's \nassistants to inquire about his availability—rather than vice versa. \nThe majority of the massages were just that and nothing else. Mr. Epstein often would be \non the telephone conducting business while he received his massage. At times, the masseuses \nwould be topless, and some sexual activity might occur—primarily self-masturbation on the part \nof Mr. Epstein. On other occasions, no sexual activity would occur at all. There was no pattern \nor practice regarding which masseuse would be scheduled on a particular day—if one would be \nscheduled at all—or whether any sexual activity might occur. Indeed, Mr. Epstein almost never \nknew which masseuse his assistants had scheduled until she arrived. See Tab 3, Toll \nRecords. \nMr. Epstein specifically requested that each masseuse be at least 18 years old. The vast \nmajority of the masseuses were in fact in their twenties, many accompanied to Mr. Epstein's \nhome by friends or even other family members. Furthermore, most of the women who have \ntestified that they were actually under 18 have specifically admitted to systematically lying to \nMr. Epstein about their age. See Tab 4 MIME Tr. at 38-39; Tab 5, =Err. at 16; Tab 6, \n2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012143 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nat 6, 8, 22, 45; Tab 7, Jr.M 13; Tab 8 Tr. at 8; Tab 9, Tr. at 5; and \nTab 10, Tr. at 14-15 (excerpts from these transcripts are included below). Furthermore, \nthe women who visited Mr. Epstein's home all visited voluntarily and many willingly returned \nseveral times. \nThe State Attorney's Office (the \"SAO\") has vast experience prosecuting sex crimes and \nconducted an exhaustive, 15-month investigation of Mr. Epstein. A Grand Jury has concluded \nthat Mr. Epstein was merely a local \"John,\" guilty of soliciting prostitution in violation of state \nlaw. Notably, Florida law distinguishes soliciting from procuring and compelling prostitution if \nminors are involved. Indeed, soliciting is a misdemeanor except for the commission of a third \nsubsequent offense, turning it into a felony. The SAO, therefore, sought and obtained an \nindictment charging Mr. Epstein with felony solicitation of prostitution. Mr. Epstein is prepared \nto plead guilty and accept a sentence for that offense—a sentence that, notably, is far more \nsevere than that meted out to other \"Johns\" convicted of violating Florida's solicitation laws for \ncases in which sexual activity was alleged. \nThough CEOS points out its admirable goal of \"protecting children,\" a moniker that \nengenders high emotions, the conduct alleged here involves women over 16, which is the age of \nconsent in 38 states and supplies the effective federal age of consent. The young women were by \nno means the target of high-school trolling; they were individuals who, with friends, visited Mr. \nEpstein's house—a home full of friends and staff. The civil complaints filed against Mr. Epstein \nreiterate the fact that the individuals who visited Mr. Epstein would visit with their friends. And \nMr. Epstein never spoke to or had any contact with these women before they arrived at his \nhouse. And again, the State is handling this matter appropriately. \nWe respectfully submit that that should be the beginning and the end of this matter. As \nyou know, the Department's Petite Policy precludes successive federal prosecutions after a State \nhas acted: \"[A] state judgment of conviction, plea agreement [here held in abeyance solely as a \nresult of the federal investigation], or acquittal on the merits shall be a bar to any subsequent \nfederal prosecution for the same act or acts.\" U.S.A.M. § 9-2.031A (emphasis added). \nConsistent with that principle, and of particular relevance to this case, the Department itself just \nrecently observed the following: \n[P]rostitution-related offenses have historically been prosecuted at the state or \nlocal level. This allocation between state and Federal enforcement authority does \nnot imply that these crimes are less serious, but rather reflects important structural \nallocations of responsibility between state and Federal governments.... [T]he \nDepartment is not aware of any reasons why state and local authorities are not \ncurrently able to pursue prostitution-related crimes such that Federal jurisdiction \nis necessary. \nSee Tab 11, November 9, 2007 Letter from Justice Department Principal Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General Brian Benczkowski to the House Committee on the Judiciary, p. 8-9. \n3 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012144 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nSummary of the Law \nWe have reviewed every reported case under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b), \nand cannot find a single one that resulted in a conviction on facts akin to the ones here. In some \nrespects, it is not surprising that no precedent supports federal prosecution of a man who engaged \nin consensual conduct, in his home, that amounts to solicitation under State law. After all, \nprostitution, even when the allegations involve minors, is fundamentally a State concern, United \nStates v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, n.1 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that federal law \"does not \ncriminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice traditionally governed by state regulation)\"), and there \nis no evidence that Palm Beach County authorities and Florida prosecutors cannot effectively \nprosecute and punish the conduct. See also Batchelder v. Gonzalez, No. 4:07-cv-00330-SPM-\nAK, 2007 WL 5022105 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 19, 2007). In fact, the opposite is true—the state-elected \nofficials, cognizant of the local mores of the community, have a lauded history of just such \nprosecutions. \nIn any event, and as set forth below, none of the federal statutes in this case remotely \nsupports a prosecution on the facts of this case without each and every element being stretched in \na novel way to encompass the behavior at issue. We begin with first principles. Courts in this \ncountry have \"traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of federal criminal statutes, \nboth out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress, Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 \n(1985), and out of concern that 'a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the \ncommon world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.' Arthur \nAndersen LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 703 (2005) (quoting McBoyle v. United States, 283 \nU.S. 25, 27 (1931)) (citation omitted). \nTwo recent Supreme Court decisions dramatically underscore these principles and help to \nhighlight why federal prosecution in this case would be improper as a matter of both law and \npolicy. See United States v. Santos, No. 06-1005 (June 2, 2008); Cuellar v. United States, No. \n06-1456 (June 2, 2008). Though they both address the interpretation and application of the \nfederal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956, the principles they set forth are equally \napplicable here. In Santos, the Court held that the statutory term \"proceeds\" means \"profits\" \nrather than \"receipts,\" and thus gave the statute a significantly narrower interpretation than what \nthe government had urged. In his plurality opinion, Justice Scalia emphasized that where a \nstatutory term in a criminal statute could support either a narrow or broad application, the narrow \ninterpretation must be adopted because \"[w]e interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of \ndefendants, not prosecutors.\" Slip op. at 12. As his opinion explained, the rule of lenity \"not \nonly vindicates the fundamental principle that no citizen should be held accountable for a \nviolation of a statute whose commands are uncertain, or subjected to punishment that is not \nclearly proscribed. It also places the weight of inertia upon the party that can best induce \n4 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012145 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nCongress to speak more clearly and keeps courts from making criminal law in Congress's stead.\" \nSlip op. at 6.1 \nIn Cuellar, the Court examined the link between the money-laundering statute's mens rea \nrequirement and the underlying elements of the offense. After a careful textual analysis of the \nstatute and its structure, the Court ruled that the defendant's conviction could be sustained only if \nhe knew that the transportation of funds to Mexico was designed to conceal their nature, \nlocation, source, ownership or control—not merely that the defendant knew that the funds had \nbeen hidden during their transportation to Mexico. Slip op. at 10-17. \nBoth decisions relied on the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms Congress chose. \nAnd both rejected attempts to broaden those words to cover conduct not clearly targeted by \nCongress. Taken together, these decisions reject the notion that prosecutors can take language \nfrom a narrowly drawn federal statute—especially one that itself federalizes the prosecution of \nconduct traditionally within the heartland of State police powers—and convert it into a license to \nreach additional conduct by ignoring, rewriting or expansively interpreting the law. Both cases \nadditionally rejected the notion that statutes should be broadly construed in order to facilitate \nprosecutions or to in anyway diminish the burden on prosecutors to prove each essential element \nof a federal charge in conformity with Congress's determinations as to what is within the federal \ncriminal law and what is not. The conflict between the Santos and Cuellar decisions and \nCEOS 's grant of effectively unlimited discretionary authority to the USA0 to take federal law to \n\"novel\" places where they have never reached before could not be starker. \nThese lessons have no less force in the context of Executive Branch decision-making \nthan they do in the context of Judicial interpretation. As you are aware, when federal prosecutors \nexercise their discretion, they bear an independent constitutional obligation to faithfully interpret \nthe law as written—not to broaden its scope beyond the limits endorsed by both Congress and \nthe President. There is no support for CEOS's view that the courts or a jury should ultimately \ndecide whether a \"novel\" construction of the law is correct. Instead, the Executive Branch itself \nhas a non-delegable obligation not to exceed its authority; the power of other branches to check \nor remedy such usurpation does not legitimize executive action that exceeds its bounds. See Tab \n12, November 2, 1994 Memorandum from Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger to the \nHon. Abner J. Mikva, Counsel To The President, on Presidential Authority To Decline To \nExecute Unconstitutional Statutes, available at http://www.usdoj.gov/olc/nonexcut.htm. \nIn this case, the text, structure, and history of the relevant federal statutes unambiguously \nindicate that these statutes were designed to address problems of a national and international \nJustice Stevens, in his concurring opinion, also acknowledged the rule of lenity, calling the plurality opinion's \ndiscussion of that rule \"surely persuasive.\" United States v. Santos, No. 06-1005, slip op. at 5 (June 2, 2008) \n(Stevens, J., concurring). \n5 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012146 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nscope—not the local conduct that is alleged here—and each of these statutes requires proof of \nthe defendant's actual knowledge that simply is not present in this case. Any attempt to stretch \nthe language of these statutes to cover this case would be a misuse of the law and contrary to \nexpress legislative intent. In short, the elements under each federal statute-18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, \n2422(b) and 2423(b)—are not satisfied here. \n1. 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b)  \n18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the \ndefendant engaged in communications over an interstate facility (e.g., the Internet or phone) with \nfour concurrent intentions: (1) to knowingly (2) persuade, induce, entice or coerce, or attempt to \npersuade, induce, entice, or coerce (3) a minor (4) to engage in prostitution or criminal sexual \nactivity for which the person can be charged. Mr. Epstein's conduct does not satisfy the \nelements of § 2422(b). Each element must be individually stretched, and then conflated in a \ntenuous chain to encompass the alleged conduct with any individual woman. \nAs the statute makes clear, the essence of this crime is the communication itself—not the \nresulting act. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in Murrell, underscores the point: \nThe defendant in Bailey contended that attempt under § 2422(b) 'requires the \nspecific intent to commit illegal sexual acts rather than just the intent to persuade \nor solicit the minor victim to commit sexual acts.' Id. at 638. In response, the \ncourt held `[w]hile it may be rare for there to be a separation between the intent to \npersuade and the follow-up intent to perform the act after persuasion, they are two \nclearly separate and different intents and the Congress has made a clear choice to \ncriminalize persuasion and the attempt to persuade, not the performance of the \nsexual acts themselves. Hence, a conviction under the statute only requires a \nfinding that the defendant had an intent to persuade or to attempt to persuade.' \nUnited States v. Murrell 368 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing United States v. Bailey, \n228 F.3d 637, 638-39 (6th Cir.2000)). Thus, the targeted criminal conduct must occur through \nthe interstate facility, not thereafter, and the scienter element must be present at the time of the \ncall or Internet contact. \nIn this case, however, Mr. Epstein did not use an interstate facility to communicate any \nillegal intention in this case; the phone calls were made by his assistants in the course of setting \nup many other appointments. Neither a conspiracy charge nor a charge of aiding and abetting \ncan fulfill the mens rea requirement here. Indeed, neither Mr. Epstein nor his assistants knew \nwhether sexual activity would necessarily result from a scheduled massage. And certainly, no \nsuch activity was ever discussed on the phone by either Mr. Epstein or his assistants. Instead, as \nthe record in this case makes clear, many appointments resulted in no illegal sexual activity, and \noften, as confirmed by the masseuses' own testimony, several individuals who were contacted by \nphone visited Mr. Epstein's house and did not perform a massage at all. Where sexual activity \n6 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012147 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \ndid result, it was mainly self-pleasuring masturbation and not necessarily illegal, but spontaneous \nand resulted from face-to-face conversations during the massage. Thus, the fact that Mr. Epstein \nlater may have persuaded any particular masseuse to engage in unlawful activity during the \nmassage does not work retroactively to render the earlier scheduling phone call an offense under \n§ 2422(b). Nor is there any evidence that women who returned to Mr. Epstein's home time and \nagain were somehow coerced or induced over a facility of interstate commerce to do so. \nThe first essential element of § 2422(b) that \"[w]hoever, using the mail or any facility or \nmeans of interstate or foreign commerce,\" by its plain language, requires that the \ncommunication, which is the essence of the crime and its actus reus, take place during the use of \nthe facility of interstate commerce (in this case, unlike the vast majority of Internet chat room \nsting operations, a telephone). The statute is not ambiguous. It requires that the criminal \nconduct occur while the defendant is \"using\" (i.e. engaged in the communication), not thereafter. \nGiven the utter lack of direct evidence against Mr. Epstein, prosecutors have signaled that \nthey intend to offer a purely circumstantial case if this matter proceeds to trial—essentially \narguing that \"routine and habit\" evidence could substitute for actual proof that an interstate \nfacility was used to solicit sex from minors. Thus, despite the fact that the calls themselves were \nnot made by Mr. Epstein and did not contain the necessary explicit communication to knowingly \ninduce minors to provide sexual favors for money, prosecutors are seeking to turn the phrase \"are \nyou available\"—the same phrase used with friends, chiropractors, and trainers—into a ten-year \nmandatory prison sentence. In any case, the prosecution's attenuated argument regarding \n\"routine and habit\" will also not fit the facts of this case. The witness testimony at issue makes \nclear that there was no clear \"routine or habit\" with respect to the interactions at issue. And in \nthose unpredictable instances where sexual contact resulted, it was a product of what occurred \nafter the benign phone communication, not during the call itself. \nThe prosecution's theory of liability—that a call to a person merely to schedule a visit to \nthe defendant's residence followed by a decision made at the residence to engage in prohibited \nsexual activity is sufficient—cannot survive either a \"plain language\" test or the rule of lenity as \nthey have been authoritatively construed in the recent Santos and Cuellar cases. The statute \ncannot be read otherwise. As the Cuellar decision makes clear, a proper interpretation of a \nfederal criminal statute is guided \"by the words of the operative statutory provision,\" not by \noutside objectives, such as those facilitating successful prosecution. See Cuellar, supra, Slip op. \nat 7. As Justice Alito stated in his concurring opinion, the government must prove not just the \n\"effect\" of the secretive transportation, but also that \"petitioner knew that achieving one of these \neffects was a design (i.e. purpose) of the transportation\" of currency. Cuellar v. United States, \nsupra, 553 US., Slip op. At 1 (Auto, J. concurring). Similarly, it is not enough that one effect of \na communication scheduling a visit between Mr. Epstein and a minor was that there might be \nsubsequent face-to-face inducement. Instead, the statute, as drafted, defines the crime as the \ncommunication and demands that far more be proven than that the use of an interstate facility \nresulted in a later meeting where even an inducement (as opposed to a solicitation) was made. \n7 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012148 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nThe prosecution has never represented to counsel that they have evidence that would \nprove that the inducement or enticement to engage in illegal sexual acts occurred over the phone \n(or Internet). The prosecution's references to \"routine and habit\" evidence that would substitute \nfor the explicit communications usually found in the transcripts from chat rooms or sting \noperations is tenuous at best. In essence, the prosecution would be alleging communications \nunderstood, but not spoken, by two people, one of whom was usually a secretary or assistant. \nSeparating the actus reus and the mens rea, however, and premising criminal liability on \npersuasion that might occur after the communication, or on the existence of a specific intent to \nengage in illegal sex with a minor that arises after the communication would violate the bedrock \nprinciple of criminal law that predicates liability on the concurrence of the act and the criminal \nstate of mind. Even if, arguendo, the communication and mens rea could be separated (a \npremise which is at odds with the requirement of concurrence), Mr. Epstein denies that the \nfactual proof demonstrates such a pattern or practice. Instead, the evidence compellingly proves \nthat there was no regularity or predictability to the content of the communication or in what \noccurred at meetings that were telephonically scheduled (including those that are the subject of \nthis investigation). \nA second essential element of 2422(b) requires that the defendant \"knowingly\" induce, \npersuade, entice or coerce a person believed to be a minor. \" . . . [K]knowingly. . . induces. .\" \nrequires the Court to define inducement so it is consistent with its ordinary usage and so the term \nis not so broad that it subsumes the separate statutory terms of \"entices\" and \"persuades.\" \nInducement has a common legal meaning that has been endorsed by the government when it \noperates to narrow the affirmative defense of entrapment. Inducement must be more than \"mere \nsolicitation;\" it must be more than an offer or the providing of an opportunity to engage in \nprohibited conduct. See, e.g,. United States v. Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d 65, 76-77 (1st Cir. \n2005); United States v. Brown, 43 F.3d 618, 625 (11th Cir. 1995). The government cannot fairly, \nor consistent with the rule of lenity, advocate a broader definition of the same term when it \nexpands a citizen's exposure to criminal liability than when it limits the ambit of an affirmative \ndefense to criminal conduct. If the term is ambiguous, absent clear Congressional intent on the \nissue, the Court's decision in Santos requires that the narrower rather than the broader definition \nbe used. \nThe facts simply do not prove Mr. Epstein's culpability for knowingly inducing or \npersuading minors. First, in the case of masseuses who agreed or even sought to return to see \nMr. Epstein on successive occasions, there is no evidence that there was any inducement, \npersuasion, enticement or coercion over the phone. And, for masseuses seeing Mr. Epstein for \nthe first time, there was generally no telephone contact with Mr. Epstein and there was no \nknowledge that any third party at Mr. Epstein's specific direction was inviting them to Mr. \nEpstein's home over the phone rather than in face-to-face meetings. The women who visited Mr. \nEpstein's home were all friends of friends. Contrary to the facts in this case, § 2422(b)'s \nknowing inducement element is essential to federal liability and, given its hefty minimum \nmandatory punishment, it should not be interpreted as a strict liability statute. \n8 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012149 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nThere is insufficient evidence that Mr. Epstein targeted minors, as required. The \nevidentiary pattern does not even establish willful blindness since Mr. Epstein took steps to \nensure his visitors were over 18—and certainly took none to avoid knowing. But, even if the \ngovernment contends that it possesses evidence that could demonstrate that Mr. Epstein knew or \nshould have known or suspected that a small number of the masseuses were underage, that would \nstill not make this an appropriate case for federal, rather than state prosecution. The federal \nstatutes were not intended to supersede state prosecutions involving isolated instances of \nunderage sex. Instead, the federal statutes were intended for large-scale rings or for an \nindividual who was engaged, while using interstate facilities such as the Internet, with the willful \ntargeting of minors. \nThe government's evidence, even when stretched to the limit, will not show a pattern of \ntargeting underage persons for illegal sexual activity. A federal prosecution should not become a \ncontest between the prosecution and defense over whether the defendant knew, suspected or \nshould have known whether a particular person was or was not over age. The history of cases \nbrought under this statute make crystal clear that knowledge of the defendant regarding the age \nof the women is required—either by admission or by incontrovertible transcripts of \nconversations (i.e. stings operations which require repeated acknowledgment of the defendant's \nawareness of the victims' age). Even states with absolute liability about mistake regarding age \nrarely prosecute cases where definitive proof is lacking (Palm Beach County rarely does and \nwhen it does, it imposes house arrest sentences). This is a matter for the exercise of state \nprosecutorial discretion and not federal mandatory minimum statutes that were not intended to \ncover such conduct. \nA third essential element of § 2422(b) is the requirement that the government prove that \nthe defendant actually believed that the person being persuaded (coerced, etc.) was a minor at the \ntime of the communication. See e.g., Offense Instruction 80, Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury \nInstructions-Criminal (2003) (\"The defendant can be found guilty of that offense only if... the \ndefendant believed that such individual was less than (18) years of age...\"); United States v. \nMurrell, 368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir. 2004) (§ 2422(b) requires that the defendant knowingly \ntarget a minor). Importantly, then, all the elements must be proven with respect to a specific \nperson. However, we are told that the majority of proof is no more than toll records, not \nrecorded conversations or Internet chat transcripts, but toll records and perhaps a memory of \nwhat was said years ago on a particular call for a particular request from a particular person \nacting at Mr. Epstein's direction. \nTwo final points bear special emphasis here. The statute, which according to Santos and \nCuellar must be narrowly construed, also requires that the inducement be to engage in \nprostitution or sexual activity \"for which [the defendant] can be charged.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b). \nHowever, simple prostitution is not defined (or made punishable) in the U.S. Code, and state law \nthus supplies the appropriate reference point. Under Florida law, \"prostitution\" entails the \n\"giving or receiving of the body for sexual activity for hire,\" Fla. Stat. § 796.07(1)(a), and the \nterm \"sexual activity\" is limited to \"oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the \n9 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012150 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nsexual organ of another; anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object; or the \nhandling or fondling of the sexual organ of another for the purpose of masturbation.\" Fla. Stat. § \n796.01(1)(d). Also, the Florida Supreme Court jury instructions define prostitution as involving \n\"sexual intercourse.\" As a result, topless massages—even ones for hire that include self-\nmasturbation—fall outside the ambit of the state-law definition of prostitution. Absent proof \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that, at the critical time of the communication, Mr. Epstein had a \nspecific intent to persuade another to engage in prostitution or \"sexual activity,\" as defined by \nFlorida law, he cannot be guilty of an offense under § 2422(b). \nAs important, the plain language of the phrase \"for which any person can be charged\" \nnecessarily excludes acts as to which the state's statute of limitations has run. Under Florida \nlaw, prostitution and prostitution-related offenses are misdemeanors in the second degree for a \nfirst violation.2 See Fla. Stat.. § 796.07(4)(a). The limitations period for a misdemeanor in the \nsecond degree is one year, and there is no tolling provision based upon the victim's age. See Fla. \nStat. § 775.15(b). Even as to allegations of third degree felonies, the statute of limitations is \nthree years. Thus, any conduct alleged to have occurred before mid-June 2005 cannot be \ncharged as a matter of state law and thus cannot be a predicate for a § 2422(b) offense—even if \nthe federal statute of limitations has not run on any given § 2422(b) offense because of the \nlengthier statute codified in 18 U.S.C. § 3282. Thus, no prosecution under § 2422(b) can be \nbrought based upon inducement of prostitution or sexual activity for which Florida's statute of \nlimitation has run. Furthermore, in Florida, the statute of limitations does not simply give rise to \nan affirmative defense. On the contrary, statute of limitations \"creates a substantive right which \nprevents prosecution and conviction of an individual after the statute has run.\" See State v. King, \n282 So. 2d 162 (Fla. 1973); Tucker v. State, 417 So. 2d 1006 (Fla. 3d D.C.A. 1982) (citing \ncases). \nGiven the one-year statute of limitations, any conduct that might amount to prostitution \nor other chargeable sexual activity that occurred before one year from today is not conduct for \nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense. Also, given the three year statute of \nlimitations for third degree felonies, any allegations of illegal state criminal conduct that is \nclassified as a third degree felony cannot be charged in the state and, concomitantly, cannot be \nthe basis for a federal charge under § 2422(b), to the extent that it occurred—as did almost all of \nthe pivotal allegations (e.g., the allegation which was made in March of 2005) \nprior to mid-June of 2005. \n2. 18 U.S.C. 1591  \n2 The offense is a felony of the third degree only for a third or subsequent violation. Fla. Stat. § 796.07(4)( c). \n10 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012151 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \n18 U.S.C. § 1591, a sex trafficking statute, provides up to 40 years' imprisonment for \nanyone (1) who recruits or obtains by any means a person in interstate commerce (ii) knowing \nthat the person is under 18 and (iii) knowing that the person will be caused to engage in a \ncommercial sex act. The most heinous of crimes, described on the CEOS website, fall within \nthis statute and include the buying and selling of children and the forced servitude of third-world \nimmigrants brought to this country to be enslaved. Mr. Epstein's behavior is nowhere near the \nheartland of this statute. This statute has also been previously reserved for prostitution rings \ninvolving violence, drugs and force. In stark contrast, there is no jurisdictional hook that brings \nMr. Epstein's conduct within the ambit of the statute, and securing a prosecution on these facts \nwould require a court to set aside both reason and precedent to convict a local 'John' with a sex-\nslavery crime. It can not be said that Mr. Epstein engaged in trafficking and slavery nor did he \nknowingly recruit or obtain underage women with knowledge that they would be caused to \nengage in a commercial sex act. Thus, prosecuting him under this statute would expand the law \nfar beyond its scope. \nTo the extent there are cases where prosecutors think that Mr. Epstein should have known \nthat certain women were underage, there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein \"caused [them] to \nengage in a commercial sex act.\" The term \"cause\" naturally implies the application of some \nsort of force, coercion, or undue pressure, but there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein's interactions \nwith the women were anything but consensual. Again, many of the women phoned Mr. \nEpstein's assistant themselves in order to determine whether he wanted a massage. Nor can the \ncause requirement be proved simply by the fact that Mr. Epstein compensated the women. After \nall, the statute elsewhere requires that the women \"engage in a commercial sex act,\" which by \ndefinition means that they would have received something of value in exchange for sexual \nservices. Interpreting the statute to authorize prosecution whenever a commercial sex act results \nfrom solicitation thus would render the term \"caused\" superfluous, and would make every 'John' \nwho interacts with an underage prostitute guilty of a federal crime—even where the transaction \nis entirely local. Read in context, then, there is no doubt that the statute targets pimps and sex-\ntraffickers who knowingly obtain underage girls and direct them to engage in prostitution. There \nis not a shred of evidence that Mr. Epstein (or his assistants) did any such thing, and he cannot be \nprosecuted under this statute. \nThe Cuellar and Santos decisions also foreclose a prosecution under § 1591. Just as the \nfederal money laundering statute did not come down to a proscription against transportation of \ncriminal proceeds that are hidden, the sex trafficking of children statute cannot be boiled down \nand expanded to a federal proscription of commercial sexual activity with persons who turn out \nto be below the age of 18. \n3. 18 U.S.C. § 2423 \n11 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012152 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \n18 U.S.C. § 2423(b), a statute enacted to prevent sex tourism, provides up to 30 years of \nimprisonment for anyone who travels across state lines (i) for the purpose of engaging in (ii) \nillicit sexual conduct with a minor. Neither of those elements is satisfied here. \nMr. Epstein did not travel to Palm Beach for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity \nwith a minor, within the meaning of the statute. The evidence is indisputable that Palm Beach \nwas where Mr. Epstein spent most of his discretionary time, and that his travels to Palm Beach \nwere merely trips returning often to his home of twenty years—not the escapades of a sex tourist \noff to some destination inextricably intertwined with the required significant or dominant \npurpose of that trip to be to have \"illicit sexual conduct.\" Epstein's trips to Palm Beach were \nsimply those of a businessperson traveling home for weekends or stopping over on his way to or \nfrom New York and St. Thomas or to visit his sick and dying mother in the hospital for months \non end. He certainly did not travel to his home in Florida for the dominant purpose of engaging \nin sexual conduct with a person who he knew was under 18 when he did not know, at the time he \ndecided to travel, from whom he was to receive a massage, if he were to receive one at all. \nIn Cuellar, the unanimous Supreme Court linked the term \"design\" in the money-\nlaundering statute to the terms \"purpose\" and \"plan,\" and stressed that those terms all required \nthe defendant to \"formulate a plan for; devise\"; \"[t]o create or contrive for a particular purpose or \neffect\"; [carry out] \"[a] plan or scheme\"; or \"to conceive and plan out in the mind.\" Slip. op. at \n12 (citing dictionary definitions). The same link is present here, and it simply cannot be said that \nMr. Epstein's design, plan, or purpose in traveling to Palm Beach was to engage in illicit sexual \nconduct with minors; his design or plan or purpose was simply to return to his home. \nAny construction of § 2423(b)'s \"for the purpose of' language to include purposes \nbeyond the dominant purpose of the travel would run afoul of the rule of lenity and due process \nprinciples discussed earlier. Any attempted prosecution of Mr. Epstein under a more expansive \nconstruction of the \"for the purpose of' language would also violate the separation of powers \ndoctrine. Congress, which selected the \"for the purpose of' language signaled no clear intention \nto make it a federal crime whenever an actor has engaged in illicit sexual conduct following his \ncrossing of state lines as long as it might be said that sexual activity at his destination was among \nthe activities he pursued there. Congress well knows how to write a statute in this field which \neliminates a purpose requirement. See 18 U.S.C. § 2423(c)(\"Any United States citizen or alien \nadmitted for permanent residence who travels in foreign commerce, and engages in any illicit \nsexual conduct with another person ...\"). § 2423(b) is not such a statute. \nFederal court decisions watering down the \"for the purpose of\" requirement fly in the \nface of the two Supreme Court decisions addressing that element. See Hansen v. Huff 291 U.S. \n559 (1934); Mortensen v. United States, 322 U.S. 369 (1944). Santos and Cuellar speak loudly \nand clearly against prosecutors seeing such elasticity in federal criminal statutes, including those \nenacted to protect important federal interests. In cases involving the federalization of activity \nthat is within the States' historic police power, Congress must speak with particular clarity. See, \ne.g., Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 65 (1989). \n12 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012153 \nIURKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nRelevant Past Cases  \nWe have not been able to find a single federal prosecution based on facts like these—but \nhave voluminous evidence of federal prosecutors routinely declining to bring charges in cases far \nmore egregious than this one. To take just one obvious example, federal prosecutors have self-\nconsciously refrained from involvement in the literally dozens of sexual cases of former priests, \nopting instead to allow seasoned state prosecutors (like the ones in this case) to pursue the \naccused former clergymen. That is so despite (1) the large number of victims, (2) the vast \ngeographic diversity of the cases, and (3) the fact that some of these cases involve allegations \nthat the defendant forcibly molested, abused, or raped literally dozens of children—including \nsome as young as five years old—over a period of years. Nonetheless, federal prosecutors have \nnot hesitated to let their state counterparts pursue these cases free from federal interference—\neven though the sentences meted out vary greatly on account of the fact that \"[c]riminal penalties \nare specific to localities or jurisdictions.\"3 The facts of this case, which involve the solicitation \nof consensual topless massages and some sexual contact, entirely in the privacy of his home and \nalmost entirely by women over the age of 18, pale in comparison to the outright sexual abuse and \ndegradation of preteen minors in many of the priest cases. \nNor does this case bear any of the hallmarks that typify the cases that federal prosecutors \nhave pursued under the federal statutes at issue here. When asked, the closest case suggested by \nthe prosecutors was United States v. Boehm—and it hardly could differ more from Mr. Epstein's \ncase. In Boehm, the defendant was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine \nbase to minors, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), and 859(a); being a felon in \npossession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1); and sex trafficking of children in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 1591. United States v. Boehm, Case No. 3:04CR00003 (D. \nAlaska 2004). Boelun's actions, unlike Mr. Epstein's, also had a strong interstate nexus: Boehm \npurchased and distributed large quantities of crack cocaine and cocaine that traveled in interstate \ncommerce, and he used his home and hotels (which were used by interstate travelers) to purchase \ndrugs and distribute them to minors while also arranging for these minors to have sex with him \nand others. Indeed, Boehm not only (1) purchased cocaine in large quantities; (2) distributed the \ndrugs to minors; (3) possessed illegal firearms; (4) and arranged for the minors to have sex with \nother members of the conspiracy in exchange for drugs; but (5) admitted to knowing the ages of \nthe individuals involved.4 Here, by contrast, as previous stated, all of the conduct took place in \nMr. Epstein's private home in Palm Beach; there was no for-profit enterprise; no interstate \ncomponent; no use by Mr. Epstein of an instrumentality of interstate commerce; no violence; no \nforce; no alcohol; no drugs; no guns; and no child pornography. \n3 See http://www.bishop-accountability.org/reports/2004_02_27_JohnJay/2004_02_27 Terry Joluday_3.htm \n#cleric7. \n4 \nIn fact, Boehm and his co-defendants distributed drugs to approximately 12 persons between the ages of 13 and \n21. Boehm also had a prior criminal history—and one that clearly showed he was a danger to society: he \npreviously had been convicted of raping both a thirteen year-old girl and a fifteen year-old girl. (Day 7 of \nSentencing hearing p. 32). \n13 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012154 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nTo the extent there is a similar, but more egregious, local Florida case on the books, it is \nthat of Barry Kutun, a former North Miami city attorney accused of having sex with underage \nprostitutes and videotaping the sessions. Mr. Kutun pleaded guilty on May 18, 2007 in a Miami-\nDade County courtroom as part of an agreement with State prosecutors and he received five \nyears probation and a withholding of adjudication with no requirement to register as a sex \noffender—all without a shred of involvement by federal prosecutors, who declined to prosecute \nhim. Indeed, given the wide use of the telephone in today's society, it gives a rogue prosecutor \ncarte blanche to turn any local crime into a federal offense. Given the federal government's \ndecision to abstain from prosecuting that case, it is hard to understand how the federal \nprosecutors responsible for this case think that the State's treatment of Mr. Epstein somehow \nleaves federal interests substantially un.vindicated. There is simply no basis for the federal \nprosecutors' disparate treatment of Mr. Epstein. \nSummary of the Evidence  \nFinally, we wish to share new evidence—obtained through discovery in connection with \nthe civil lawsuits filed in this matter—which confirms that further federal involvement in this \nmatter would be inappropriate. This testimony taken to date categorically confirms that (i) Mr. \nEpstein did not target minors; (ii) women under 18 often lied to Mr. Epstein about their ages; (iii) \nMr. Epstein did not travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual \nactivity; (iv) Mr. Epstein did not use the Internet, telephone or any other means of interstate \ncommunication to coerce or entice alleged victims; (v) Mr. Epstein did not apply force or \ncoercion to obtain sexual favors; and (vi) all sexual activity that occurred was unplanned and \npurely consensual. The women's own statements—made under oath—demonstrate the absence \nof a legitimate federal concern in this matter, and highlight the serious practical difficulties an \nattempted federal prosecution would face. \n• Mr. Epstein did not recruit or obtain these women in interstate commerce (necessary \nfor a conviction under § 1591). \no confirmed that she did not know Mr. Epstein and had \nabsolutely no contact with him—be it through Internet, chat rooms, email, \nor phone—prior to their arrival at his home.

A federal \nprosecution based on these facts would be an unprecedented exercise of federal power, a misuse \nof federal resources, and a prosecution that would carry with it the appearance, if not the reality, \nof unwarranted selectivity given the incongruity between the facts as developed in this matter \nand the factual paradigms for all other reported federal prosecutions under each of the three \nstatutes being considered. It would require the pursuit of a novel legal theory never before \nsanctioned by federal law—and that indeed is inconsistent with each of the statutes prosecutors \nhave identified. Accordingly, we respectfully request that you direct the U.S. Attorney's Office \nfor the Southern District of Florida to discontinue its involvement in this matter, and return \nresponsibility for this case to the State of Florida. \n17 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012158 \nSUMMARY OF \nMISCONDUCT \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012159 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nSUMMARY OF MISCONDUCT ISSUES IN THE MATTER OF JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN \n• The manner in \nwhich federal prosecutors have pursued the allegations against Mr. Epstein is highly irregular \nand warrants full review by the Depaament. While we repeatedly have raised our concerns \nregarding misconduct with the United States Attorney's Office in Miami (the \"USAO\"), not only \nhas it has remained unwilling to address these issues, but Mr. Epstein's defense counsel has been \ninstructed to limit its contact to the very prosecutors who are the subject of this misconduct \ncomplaint. For your review, this document summarizes the USAO's conduct in this case. \nBackground  \n1. In March 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department opened a criminal investigation of \nPalm Beach resident, Jeffrey E. Epstein. The press has widely reported that Mr. Epstein \nis a close friend of former President Bill Clinton. \n2. In July 2006, after an intensive probe, including interviews of dozens of witnesses, \nreturns of numerous document subpoenas, multiple trash pulls and the execution of a \nsearch warrant on his residence, Mr. Epstein was indicted by a Florida Grand Jury on one \ncount of felony solicitation of prostitution. \n3. In a publicly released letter, Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter criticized the Grand \nJury's decision and the State Attorney's handling of the case. Shortly after the Grand \nJury's indictment, the Chief took the unprecedented step of releasing his Department's \nraw police reports of the investigation (including Detective Recarey's unedited written \nreports of witness statements and witness identification information), that were later \nproven to be highly inaccurate transcriptions of witnesses' actual statements. The Chief \nalso publicly asked federal authorities to prosecute the case. \nJeffrey Sloman Becomes Involved in Mr. Epstein's Case at the Earliest Stage \n4. In early November of 2006, Epstein's lawyers had their initial contact with the newly \nassigned line federal prosecutor, A. Marie Villafana. Although it is extremely unusual \nfor a First Assistant United States Attorney to participate in such a communication, \nFAUSA Jeffrey Sloman was present on that very first phone call. \n5. On November 16, 2006, despite that the fact that the investigation exclusively concerned \nillegal sexual conduct during massage sessions, AUSA Villafana issued irrelevant official \ndocument requests seeking Mr. Epstein's 2004 and 2005 personal income-tax returns, \nand later subpoenaed his medical records. See Tab 16, November 16, 2006 Letter from \nM. Villafana. \nSloman Becomes Personally Involved in a Dispute Over Another State Sex Case \n6. In March 2007, FAUSA Sloman reported to local police an attempted trespass by a 17-\nyear-old male. Mr. Sloman claimed that the individual had attempted to enter Mr. \nSloman's home without invitation to make contact with his 16-year-old daughter, but he \nspotted the young man before the perpetrator had an opportunity to enter the house. The \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012160 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nsame individual had previously fled the home of another neighbor after entering that \nhouse uninvited, when, looking for the bedroom of their 17-year-old daughter, he \nmistakenly entered the bedroom of their 14-year-old daughter, touched her on the leg and \nstartled her awake. State of Florida v. Johnathan Jeffrey Zirulnikoff, Case No. F078646 \n(June 28, 2007). \n7. After a thorough review by the Miami State Attorney's Office, and sex-crimes prosecutor \nLaura Adams, the investigation revealed that the defendant and both the neighbor's 17-\nyear-old daughter and Mr. Sloman's daughter were previously acquainted. The \ndefendant was charged with simple trespass in connection with his unauthorized entry \ninto the neighbor's house. Id. \n8. FAUSA Sloman, however, demanded that the young man be registered as a sex offender \nand objected to any sentence short of incarceration. The Assistant State Attorney in \ncharge of the sex-crimes unit reported Mr. Sloman's conduct during the proceedings as \n\"outrageous.\" The defendant's attorney described Mr. Sloman as being \"out of control.\" \nShortly after, Mr. Sloman began publicly deriding the elected State Attorney, his office \nand the state process for prosecuting sex offenses, as \"a joke.\" \nUnauthorized Tactics in Disregard of the United States Attorney's Manual are Used \n9. In June 2007, AUSA Villafana subpoenaed the investigating agent of Epstein's attorney, \nRoy Black, in a clear effort to invade the defense camp. The subpoena was specifically \ndrafted to discover the investigator's contacts, with all prospective witnesses, Mr. Epstein \nand his attorneys.' Not surprisingly, Ms. Villafana issued this subpoena without the \nrequisite prior approval by the DOJ's Office of Enforcement Operations. See United \nStates Attorneys' Manual, § 9-13.410. When confronted, she misleadingly responded \nthat she had consulted with the Department of Justice and was not required to obtain \n0E0 approval because her subpoena was not directed to \"an office physically located \nwithin an attorney's office.\" See Tab 18, December 13, 2007 Letter from M. Villafana at \n4 n.1 . This answer clearly suggests that Ms. Villafana had intentionally misled the \nDepartment officials about the items that her subpoena sought.2 \nThe subpoena sought, among other things: \"All documents and information related to the nature of the \nrelationship between [the investigator and/or his firm] and Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, including but not limited to . . . \nrecords of the dates when services were performed . . . telephone logs or records of dates of communications \nwith Mr. Epstein (or with a third party on Mr. Epstein's behalf); appointment calendars/datebooks and the like \n(whether in hard copy or electronic form) for any period when work was performed on behalf of Mr. Epstein or \nwhen any communication was had with Mr. Epstein (or with a third party on Mr. Epstein's behalf) . See Tab \n17, June 18, 2007 Subpoena to William Riley! Riley Kiraly, If 3. \nIndeed, we are aware of two other recent instances in which Villafana placed serious misrepresentations before \na court. On July 31, 2007, in the grand-jury litigation arising out of this case, she filed the \"Declaration of \nJoseph Recarey,\" attaching the state detective's affidavit in support of a search warrant for Epstein's house. See \nIn Re Grand Jury Subpoenas Duces Tecum OLY-63 and OLY-64, No. FGJ 07-103(WPB) (S.D. Fla. July 31, \n2007). At the time she filed Detective Recarey's affidavit, she knew it contained numerous material \nmisrepresentations, including gross misstatements of witness statements and other evidence. Second, we \n(Continued...) \n2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012161 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nMr. Epstein is Required to Agree to Civil Liability In Order to Avoid a Federal Indictment \n10. On July 31, 2007, during negotiations over a possible federal plea agreement, FAUSA \nSloman and AUSA Villafana demanded that Mr. Epstein agree to the imposition of civil \nliability under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 as a pre-condition to deferral of federal prosecution. To \nthe best of our knowledge, the inclusion of such a term in a deferred prosecution \nagreement of this kind is absolutely unprecedented.3 Specifically, Ms. Villafana \ndemanded that Mr. Epstein waive the right to contest civil liability to a list of individuals \nshe said were \"victims\" of § 2255, whose names, however, she refused to disclose, and \nagree to pay damages of a minimum of $150,000 to each and every one of such \nundisclosed individuals, and hire an attorney to represent them if they decided to sue \nhim. See Tab 20, July 31, 2007 Draft of Deferred Prosecution Agreement. \n11. FAUSA Sloman and AUSA Villafana insisted that the identities of the individuals on the \nlist not be disclosed to Mr. Epstein or his counsel until after Mr. Epstein was already \nsentenced in the state case. \n(a) Over the next two months, Mr. Sloman refused to negotiate these terms. They \nultimately became incorporated into the final deferred prosecution agreement. \nSee Tab 21, September 24, 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement, T117-11. \n(b) It was not until seven months later, in February 2008, that Epstein's lawyers were \nable to take their first official statement from one of the women FAUSA Sloman \nalleged were minor victims of federal offenses. \n(c) This statement, a deposition of the initial complainant in the state \ncase, taken in the presence of her lawyer, proved that none of the necessary \nelements for any federal charge could be satisfied based on brief \ncontact with Mr. Epstein. The witness also admitted lying to Mr. Epstein, \ntestifying that she told him that she was an adult  and wanted him to believe that \nshe was an adult. See Tab 13,_____________________(deposition), p. 35 (\"Q. So you \ntold Jeff that you were 18 years old, correct? A. Yes.\"), 37 (\"Q. You wanted Mr. \nEpstein to believe that you really were 18, right? A. Correct.\"). \n(d) Shortly after this deposition, the defense was able to obtain statements from other \nwomen on Mr. Sloman's so called \"list of § 2255 victims\" and, so far, all such \nstatements also continue to demonstrate that Mr. Sloman's repeated \nrepresentations to the defense about the existence of federal jurisdiction were \nfalse. \nunderstand that Villafana was recently reprimanded at a special hearing convened by a United States District \nJudge in the West Palm Beach Division of the Southern District of Florida, for making misrepresentations \nduring a prior sentencing proceeding. \n3 In fact, Stephanie Thacker, a former deputy to CEOS Chief Drew Oosterbaan, has stated that she knew of no \nother case like this being prosecuted by CEOS. \n3 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012162 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \n12. In August 2007, in a clear attempt to coerce a state settlement, Ms. Villafana threatened \nto broaden the investigation to include a money laundering violation (18 U.S.C. § 1956), \nthough all the funds expended were simply Mr. Epstein's, and a violation for operating an \nunlicensed money-transmitting business (18 U.S.C. § 1960), though Mr. Epstein never \nhad such a business. See Tab 22, August 31, 2007 Letter from M. Villafana to Ross \n(reciting, in a target letter to one of Epstein's employees, that the investigation concerns \n\"suspected violations of federal law, including but not limited to, possible violations of \nTitle 18, United States Code, Sections . . . 1591, . . . 1956, 1960 . . . .\") (emphasis \nadded). \n13. On the very same day that the grand jury issued subpoenas to the records-custodian and \nemployees of Epstein's businesses for all financial transactions from 2003 forward, Ms. \nVillafana (who we were told was not authorized to act in this regard without supervisory \napproval) promised to close the money-laundering investigation \"if the sex offense case \nis resolved.\" See Tab 23, August 16, 2007 Letter from M. Villafana to G. Lefcourt (\"In \nother words, if the sex offense case is resolved, the Office would close its investigation \ninto other areas as well. The matter has not been, and it does not appear that it will be, \nresolved so the money laundering investigation continues, and Request Number 6 \n[seeking records of every financial transaction conducted by Epstein and his six \nbusinesses from \"January 1, 2003 to the present\"] will not be withdrawn.\"). \n14. Two weeks later, when Mr. Epstein continued to oppose federal prosecution during \nnegotiations and Mr. Epstein's counsel sought a meeting with the United States Attorney, \nAUSA Villafana then classified all of Mr. Epstein's assistants as targets (sending a target \nletter to one of them and promising the attorney of the other two that additional target \nletters would be served on them as well), dispatched FBI agents to the homes of two of \nhis secretaries, and personally telephoned Mr. Epstein's largest business client to advise \nhim of the nature of the investigation. See Tab 22, August 31, 2007 Letter from M. \nVillafana to \nFAUSA Sloman Forces Mr. Epstein's Lawyers to Convince the State Prosecutors To  \nImpose a More Severe Sentence Than They Believe Is Appropriate  \n15. Throughout the plea negotiations with the USAO, Mr. Sloman and Ms. Villafana \ncontinually insisted that the only way they would agree not to bring a federal indictment \nwas if Epstein's lawyers, not the state prosecutors as required under the Petite Policy, \nconvinced the state prosecutors to impose a more severe punishment than the state \nbelieved was appropriate under the circumstances. \n16. FAUSA Sloman's version of the history with respect to the sentence he required Mr. \nEpstein's lawyers to seek from the State contradicts his later assertion, which is patently \nfalse—that \"the SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of \nincarceration\" and \"considered a plea to federal charges that limited Epstein's \nsentencing exposure . .. \" See Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from J. Sloman. In fact, by a \nemail dated August 3, 2007, Criminal Division Chief Matthew Menchel advised the \ndefense that the federal government required a minimum term of two years of \nincarceration. See Tab 40, August 3, 2007 Email from M. Menchel. Subsequently, Ms. \n4 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012163 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nVillafana emailed the defense stating that United States Attorney Acosta would accept no \nless than 18 months of incarceration, following by a one-year term of house arrest. \nFederal Prosecutors Misrepresented the Number of Alleged \"Victims.\"  \n17. In September 2007, in order to add additional pressure on Mr. Epstein to execute a \ndeferred prosecution agreement, AUSA Villafana claimed that there were \"40\" minors on \nthe government's list of purported § 2255 victims. To compound that misleading \ncharacterization, she continued to insist that a guardian-ad-litem be appointed to represent \nthese purported \"minors\" in the proceedings. See Tab 24, September 19, 2007 Email \nfrom M. Villafana to J. Lefkowitz. \n18. When challenged as to whether there was a genuine need for a guardian, given that Ms. \nVillafana continued to refuse to disclose the names or any other information about her \nputative list of \"minors,\" she eventually conceded that only \"I is definitely under 18 still, \nand I think there is another minor.\" See Tab 25, September 23, 2007 Email from M. \nVillafana to J. Lefkowitz (emphasis added). \n19. The next day, AUSA Villafana retreated from the number \"40,\" stating that she had now \n\"compiled a list of 34 confirmed minor victims with no definition of how they would be \nconsidered as such.. There are six others, whose names we already have, who need to be \ninterviewed by the FBI to confirm whether they were 17 or 18 at the time of their activity \nwith Mr. Epstein.\" See Tab 26, September 24, 2007 Email from M. Villafana to J. \nLefkowitz (emphasis added). This statement indicated that, at least the \"six others\" (and, \nas it turns out, all those identified except two) had reached the age of majority, and, in \nfact, no guardian was necessary to represent their interests. \nDefense Counsel was Falsely Advised That the Non Prosecution Agreement Would Be Kept \nConfidential.  \n20. On September 24, Epstein and the USAO executed a Non Prosecution Agreement. \n21. His attorneys asked Ms. Villafana to \"please do whatever you can to keep this from \nbecoming public.\" See Tab 27, September 24, 2007 Email from J. Lefkowitz to M. \nVillafana. \n22. Ms. Villafana replied that she had \"forwarded your message only to Alex [Acosta], Andy \n[Lourie], and Rolando [Garcia]. I don't anticipate it going any further than that.\" Id. \n23. Ms. Villafana stated that the agreement would be \"placed in the case file, which will be \nkept confidential since it also contains identifying information about the girls.\" Id. \nThe Prosecution Immediately Notifies Three Plaintiffs That Mr. Epstein Has Executed A  \nNon Prosecution Agreement  \n24. In direct violation of these representations, \"shortly after the signing,\" the government \nnotified \"three victims\" of the \"general terms\" of the Non Prosecution Agreement. See \n5 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012164 \n(c) \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nTab 18, December 13, 2007 Letter from M. Villafana (admitting that the notification \noccurred \"shortly after the signing\"). \nAUSA Villafana Misleads Mr. Epstein In An Attempt To Refer Plaintiffs to Her \nBoyfriend's Close Friend  \n25. On September 25, Ms. Villafana recommended a local products-liability defense \nattorney, Humberto \"Bert\" Ocariz, Esq., for the highly lucrative post of attorney \nrepresentative for the government's list of as-yet-undisclosed \"victims.\"4 \n(a) \nMs. Villafana wrote to the defense, \"I have never met Bert, but a good friend in \nour appellate section and one of the district judges in Miami are good friends \nwith him and recommended him.\" See Tab 28, September 25, 2007 Email from \nM. Villafana to J. Lefkowitz (bottom email) (emphasis added). \n(b) Ms. Villafana failed to disclose that this \"good friend in our appellate section\" \nwas her live-in boyfriend. See Tab 18, December 13, 2007 Letter from M. \nVillafana (conceding the \"relationship\" with \"my boyfriend\"). \nBeyond her clear conflict-of-interest and affirmative effort to conceal it, it is \nunimaginable that AUSA Villafana would have engaged in an ex-parte \ncommunication with a United States District Judge in the same district about the \ndetails of a pending grand-jury investigation without prior disclosure and \nsupervisory approval. \n(d) Later, it became clear that Ms. Villafana also had at least one other ex-parte \ncommunication with that same United States District Judge about the grand jury's \ninvestigation. See Tab 29, October 5, 2007 Email from M. Villafana to J. \nLefkowitz (stating that \"one of the District Judges in Miami mentioned [retired \nJudge Joseph Hatchett] as a good choice\" to decide any fee disputes concerning \nEpstein's paying for a lawyer to represent the unnamed women in claims against \nEpstein). \n26. The next day, AUSA Villafana advised the defense that she was removing one of the \nalternatives to Mr. Ocariz from our consideration, on the basis that \"one of his partners is \nmarried to an AUSA here,\" and explained that, because of that personal relationship, \n4 \nThese actions were improper. As you know, the Department prohibits employees from using any nonpublic \ninformation to secure private benefits of any kind: \"An employee shall not ... allow the improper use of \nnonpublic information to further his own private interest or that of another, whether through advice or \nrecommendation, or by knowing unauthorized disclosure.\" 5 C.F.R. § 2635.703 (emphasis added). Among \nthe examples of prohibited disclosure specifically illustrated by this regulation is the disclosure of nonpublic \ninformation to \"friends\" to further their financial interests, id., at Example 1, and the disclosure of nonpublic \ninformation to a newspaper reporter, id., at Example 5 (see allegations below regarding the leak to the New York \nTimes). Furthermore, the Justice Department prohibits its employees from using their position to benefit friends \nor relatives. See 5. C.F.R. § 2635.702; see also 5. C.F.R. § 2535.502. \n6 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012165 \nIURKLAND &ELLIS LLP \n\"[t]here is too great a chance of an appearance of impropriety.\" See Tab 28, September \n26, 2007 Email from M. Villafana to J. Lefkowitz. \n27. The following day, Ms. Villafana relayed that, and asked us to respond to, the very first \nconcern raised Mr. Ocariz, which was \"how are they going to get paid\" and whether \n\"there is any cap or other limitation on attorney's fees that [Epstein] will pay in the civil \ncase.\" See Tab 30, September 27, 2007 Email from M. Villafana to J. Lefkowitz. \n28. Ms. Villafana clearly contemplated that Mr. Epstein would be paying for Mr. Ocariz at \nhis \"hourly rate\" to represent the alleged \"victims\" against Epstein even \"if all [the] girls \ndecide they want to sue.\" Id. \n29. When the defense complained of Ms. Villafana's undisclosed conflict-of-interest in \nselecting her boyfriend's friend to prosecute civil claims against Mr. Epstein on behalf of \nher undisclosed list of purported \"victims,\" Ms. Villafana later argued that Mr. Epstein \nhad no right to complain because \"the Non-Prosecution Agreement vested the Office with \nthe exclusive right to select the attorney representative.\" See Tab 18, December 13, 2007 \nLetter from M. Villafana. Shortly after being notified, however, United States Attorney \nAcosta removed Mr. Ocariz from consideration, and requested an amendment to the Non \nProsecution Agreement. \n30. In response to the many complaints about Ms. Villafana's misconduct and violations of \nthe United States Attorney's Manual, Criminal Division Chief Matthew Menchel \ncharacterized her as \"unsupervisable.\" \n31. Contrary to the express agreement of United States Attorney Acosta that the federal \ngovernment would not interfere in the administration of any state sentence, FAUSA \nSloman continued to try to deny the right of the State to issue work release and/or gain \ntime by stating that Mr. Epstein must \"make a binding recommendation that the Court \nimpose\" a sentence of 18 months of continuous confinement in the county jail. See Tab \n21, September 24, 2007 Non Prosecution Agreement. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Sloman \nsent the FBI to meet with the state sex-crimes prosecutor in an attempt to secure her \ncommitment to oppose a work release option. \nFAUSA Sloman Attempts to Thwart Discovery \n32. On October 31, Mr. Sloman emailed Mr. Epstein's counsel, confirming that \"I understand \nthat the plea and sentence will occur on or before the January 4th [2008] date.\" See Tab \n41, October 31, 2007 Email from J. Sloman to J. Lefkowitz (emphasis added). \n33. On November 5, despite Mr. Sloman's having sent that email just one week before, after \nlearning that the defense had begun to question women on their \"list,\" Mr. Sloman wrote \nMr. Epstein's attorneys demanding that his plea and sentencing in the State case now be \nmoved up to November 2007. See Tab 2, November 5, 2007 Letter from J. Sloman. \n34. Mr. Sloman further demanded in the letter that Mr. Epstein's attorneys \"confirm that \nthere will be no further efforts to contact any victims\" until the victims are represented by \ncounsel. Id. As the women were all adults, there could be no lawful justification for Mr. \n7 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012166 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nSloman's demand, other than to protect prospective plaintiffs from being interviewed \nprior to their retaining an attorney (including, as it turned out, Mr. Sloman's former law \npartner) to bring civil lawsuits against Epstein. \n35. Mr. Sloman also demanded that Epstein \"begin his term of incarceration not later than \nJanuary 4, 2008,\" id., which turned out to be just three weeks before the first civil lawsuit \nwould be filed against Epstein. \n36. Contrary to the express agreement of United States Attorney Acosta that the federal \ngovernment would not interfere in the administration of any state sentence, Mr. Sloman \ntried to limit gain time and or work release by stating that Mr. Epstein must \"make a \nbinding recommendation that the Court impose a sentence of 18 months of continuous \nconfinement in the county jail.\" Id. (This followed Mr. Sloman's position that the Office \nwould consider a state sentence ordering probation in lieu of incarceration to be a breach \nof the deferred-prosecution agreement.) Shortly thereafter, Mr. Sloman sent the FBI to \nmeet with the state sex-crimes prosecutor in an attempt to secure her commitment to \noppose work release. \n37. Mr. Sloman insisted that Mr. Epstein not learn the identities of the government's list of \nalleged \"victims\" until after Epstein was sentenced and incarcerated. \n38. We have reason to believe that, around this same time, Mr. Sloman's former law partner, \nJeffrey Herman, had met with the father of one of the prospective plaintiffs, Saige \nGonzalez.5 At the same time (and until as recently as March of 2008), the Official \nFlorida Bar website continued to identify Mr. Sloman as a named partner in Mr. \nHerman's firm. See Tab 31, Florida Bar Website page. \n39. Mr. Herman, who is the named partner in the former firm of Herman, Sloman, \nMermelstein, filed five lawsuits, each asking for $50 million, against Mr. Epstein. Each \nlawsuit is entitled \"Jane Doe # vs. Jeffrey Epstein,\" despite the fact that each of the \nplaintiffs is an adult and not entitled to plead anonymously. See Tab 32, Examples of \nFederal Complaints. \n40. Mr. Herman convened press conferences contemporaneously with filing three of the \nsuits. In the most recent press conference, he admitted that all of the plaintiffs lied to \nEpstein about their ages. See Tab 33, Herman Public Statement. One of the supposedly \ntraumatized \"victims\" actually pled in her complaint that she returned to Epstein's house \n\"on many occasions for approximately three years.\" Another of these supposedly \ntraumatized \"victims\" herself acted to introduce her friends and acquaintances to Mr. \n5 \nThe Justice Department rules disqualify employees from working on matters in which their former employers \nhave an interest: \"an employee shall be disqualified for two years from participating in any particular matter \nin which a former employer is a party or represents a party if he received an extraordinary payment from \nthat person prior to entering Government service. The two-year period of disqualification begins to run on the \ndate that the extraordinary payment is received.\" 5 C.F.R. § 2635.503(a) (emphasis added). \n8 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012167 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nEpstein. All of these plaintiffs are apparently on the above-described government \n\"victim\" list. \nFAUSA Sloman Attempts to Encourage Civil Suits and the Hiring of the Government's  \nChoice of Attorney  \n41. On November 27, Mr. Sloman sent an email to Mr. Epstein's attorneys stating that \"I \nintend to notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday [two days later].\" See Tab 34, \nNovember 27, 2007 Email from J. Sloman to J. Lefkowitz. \n42. The morning of November 28, attorneys for Mr. Epstein faxed a letter to Assistant \nAttorney General Alice Fisher, requesting a meeting with her to discuss the impropriety \nof the USAO's encouraging civil lawsuits against Mr. Epstein under the guise of the \nterms of the Non Prosecution Agreement. See Tab 35, November 28, 2007 Letter from \nK. Starr to A. Fisher. \n43. Late in the day on November 28, Epstein's attorneys received from AUSA Villafana a \ncopy of the USAO's proposed victim-notification letter that \"Jeff [Sloman] asked that I \nforward.\" See Tab 36, November 28, 2007 Email from M. Villafana to J. Lefkowitz. \n(a) The proposed victim-notification letter cited as authority the \"Justice for All Act \nof 2004\" (which U.S. Attorney Acosta later agreed had no application to these \ncircumstances). It referred to the addressees as minor \"victims,\" suggested they \nmake statements in state court, that they were not entitled to make, and referred \nincorrectly to Mr. Epstein as a \"sexual predator.\" Id. \n(b) FAUSA Sloman also proposed advising recipients, in an underlined sentence that, \n\"You have the absolute right to select your own attorney\" to \"assist you in making \n. . . a claim\" for \"damages from [Epstein].\" But that \"[i]f you do decide to use \n[two attorneys selected by the U.S. Attorney's \"special master\"] as your attorneys, \nMr. Epstein will be responsible for paying attorney's fees incurred during the time \nspent trying to negotiate a settlement.\" Id. \nThe USA() Leaks Confidential Information to the New York Times \n44. Perhaps most troubling of all, the USAO has repeatedly leaked information about this \ncase to the media—including to Landon Thomas, the senior business correspondent for \nthe New York Times. We have personally reviewed Mr. Thomas's own notes, and they \nare remarkably detailed about highly confidential aspects of the prosecution's theory of \nthe case and the plea negotiations. \n45. Mr. Thomas's calls to the USAO initially were referred to Assistant United States \nAttorney David Weinstein. AUSA Weinstein informed Mr. Thomas that federal \nauthorities were considering charging Mr. Epstein under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422 and \n2423, and told the reporter that Mr. Epstein had both lured girls over the telephone and \ntraveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in sex with minors. AUSA \nWeinstein also divulged the terms and conditions of the USAO's negotiations with Mr. \nEpstein—including the fact that Mr. Epstein had proposed \"house arrest\" with extra \n9 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012168 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nstringent conditions—which Mr. Weinstein could only have learned from FAUSA \nSloman, AUSA Villafana or United States Attorney Acosta himself. \n46. AUSA Weinstein then asked why Mr. Epstein should ... be treated differently than \nanyone else. Mr. Thomas apparently stated that he understood that there was evidence \nthat the women had lied about their ages. AUSA Weinstein replied that this was not a \ndefense and that Mr. Thomas should not believe \"the spin\" of Mr. Epstein's \"high-priced \nattorneys.\" Indeed, Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Thomas that the USA() was very concerned \nabout a Palm Beach editorial that questioned whether Mr. Epstein would receive a rich \nman's justice. AUSA Weinstein then stated that, in fact, Mr. Epstein \"doesn't have a \ndefense.\" \n47. Mr. Epstein's attorneys learned of the call and complained to the USAO. Counsel for \nMr. Epstein then had an in-person meeting with FAUSA Sloman and United States \nAttorney Acosta describing these leaks to the New York Times. During Mr. Thomas' next \ncall to the USAO, made two weeks later, AUSA Weinstein \"admonished\" him (in the \nwords of Mr. Thomas) for disclosing the contents of their prior conversation to the \ndefense, and strongly \"reminded\" Mr. Thomas that AUSA Weinstein's prior comments \nabout Mr. Epstein had only been \"hypothetical\" in nature. That claim is sheer nonsense: \nAUSA Weinstein had disclosed specific details of Mr. Epstein's case, including plea \nterms proposed by the defense, as revealed based on Mr. Thomas's own \ncontemporaneous hand-written notes. \n48. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Sloman wrote to the defense that Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant \nto his request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes.\" See \nTab 37, February 27, 2008 Email from J. Sloman. Again, that claim was utterly false; \nMr. Thomas's contemporaneous hand-written notes, reviewed by Jay Lefkowitz, confirm \nthat the USAO had violated settled Department policy and ethical rules by providing \ncase-specific information about the Department's legal theories and plea negotiations. \nConclusion \nWe bring these difficult and delicate matters of misconduct to your attention not to \nrequire any disciplinary action or review by the Office of Professional Responsibility. Although \nwe have been told that some of this misconduct has been self-reported (only after we raised these \ncomplaints in writing), we feel confident that not all the facts were adequately presented. Rather, \nwe believe that they are highly relevant to your decision whether to authorize a federal \nprosecution in this case. This pattern of overzealous prosecutorial activity strongly suggests \nimproper motives in targeting Jeffrey Epstein, not because of his actions (which are more \nappropriately the subject of state prosecution), but, rather, because of who he is and who he \nknows. We also bring this pervasive pattern of misconduct to your attention because we believe \nit taints any ongoing federal prosecution. The misconduct pervades the evidence in this case. \nThe offers of financial inducement to witnesses, improperly encouraged by the government, \nmake their potential testimony suspect. The reliance on tainted evidence gathered by the state \nwill require a careful sorting out of poisonous fruits. \n10 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012169 \nKIIUCLAND &ELLIS LLP \nMost important, however, is that the extraordinary nature of this misconduct, so unusual \nin ordinary federal prosecutions, raises the gravest of concerns about why prosecutors would go \nto such lengths in a case already being prosecuted by the State and with so little, if any, federal \nconcern. Accordingly, we ask you to conduct your own investigation of these matters, because \nwe believe that what we have provided you may constitute only the tip of a very deep iceberg. \nWithout the power of subpoena, which we currently lack, we are unable to dig deeper. We \nstrongly believe that there is far more exculpatory evidence that has not been disclosed, more \nleaks that we have not yet uncovered and more questionable behavior. This is a case that cries \nout for a deeper investigation than we are capable of conducting, before any decision to \nprosecute is permitted. \n11 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012170 \nRESPONSE TO \nFAUSA \nSLOMAN'S LETTER \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012171 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nResponse to Letter by FAUSA Sloman Dated May 19, 2008 \nIn a May 19, 2008 letter to Jay Lefkowitz (See Tab 1), SDFL First Assistant U.S. \nAttorney Jeffrey Sloman provided what purported to be a summary of the events that have \noccurred during the investigation of Mr. Epstein. Mr. Sloman's letter is fraught with \ninconsistencies, false and misleading characterizations and outright falsehoods. The comparison \nbelow between the false assertions in Mr. Sloman's letter and what actually transpired is only the \ntip of the iceberg. We respectfully submit that Mr. Sloman's letter alone demonstrates the \ndegree to which the record of facts have been distorted and these distortions have permeated this \nunprecedented investigation. \n1. \"INDEPENDENT\" AND \"DE NOVO\" REVIEW. \nMr. Sloman's Letter: \n• \"[W]e obliged your request for an independent de nova review of the investigation and \nfacilitated such review at the highest levels of the Department of Justice. \" Tab 1, May \n19, 2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 5, 1 3. \nThe Truth: \n• CEOS' review, concluded in May 2008, was neither independent nor de nova. \no CEOS' review was not \"independent:\" \n• Drew Oosterbaan, who conducted the review on behalf of CEOS, had \nalready reviewed the prosecution memo on this matter eight months \nearlier. During a meeting with defense counsel at the United States \nAttorney's Office in Miami (the \"USAO\") in September of 2007, he \nopined that he so believed in the prosecution that he \"would try the case \nmyself.\" \n• Indeed, Mr. Sloman acknowledges that Mr. Oosterbaan had previously \nopined on this matter, stating: \nThis particular attack on this statute [18 U.S.C. § 2242(b)] \nhad been previously raised and thoroughly considered and \nrejected by . . . CEOS prior to the execution of the \n[Deferred Prosecution] Agreement [in September 2007]. \nId., p. 5 (emphasis added). \n• The statute Mr. Sloman referred to (§ 2422(b)) lies at the heart of the \nEpstein investigation. Thus, according to Mr. Sloman, Mr. Oosterbaan \nwas tasked with reviewing his own prior decision regarding applying the \nkey statute under which the SDFL proposed prosecuting Mr. Epstein. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012172 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \n• The defense immediately raised concerns regarding the non-independence \nof the review when told that it would be Mr. Oosterbaan tasked with \nproviding the review, but was told that when Mr. Oosterbaan rendered his \nprior opinion, \"he was not really up to speed on the facts\" \no CEOS' review was not de novo: \n• By letter dated May 15, 2008 (four days before Mr. Sloman's letter), Mr. \nOosterbaan advised Mr. Lefkowitz that CEOS reviewed the matter only \nfor abuse of discretion: \n[T]he question we sought to answer was whether U.S. \nAttorney Acosta would abuse his discretion if he \nauthorized prosecution in this case. \nSee Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from D. Oosterbaan, p. 1 (emphasis \nadded). See also, id., p. 2 (\"Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his \ndiscretion if he decided to pursue such a course of action.\"); and p. 5 \n(\"Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he \nauthorized federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein.\"). \n• For the factual record of its \"abuse of discretion\" review, CEOS relied on \nthe very same prosecution memo that it had already reviewed in rendering \nits prior opinion, stating: \nAs you know, our review of this case is limited, both factually and \nlegally. We have not looked at the entire universe of facts in this \ncase. \nSee Id., p. 1 (emphasis added). \n• Nor did CEOS review any facts related to the irregular provisions in the \nDeferred Prosecution Agreement or the numerous complaints of \nprosecutorial misconduct, both of which are inextricably intertwined with \nthe impropriety of the investigation. Id. at 1. \n2. NOTIFICATION OF WITNESSES. \nMr. Sloman's Letter: \n• Mr. Sloman dismissed the totality of the defense's objections to the inappropriate \nnotification the SDFL proposed to send to its witnesses, stating merely that: \n\"[Y]ou objected to victims['] being notified of time and place of Epstein's \nstate[-]court sentencing hearing.\" \n2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012173 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nSee Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 4, 'ff 1. \nThe Truth: \n• The defense engaged in days of negotiation and made 14 separate substantive objections \nto the unprecedented notification letter that Mr. Sloman threatened to send to an \nundisclosed list of \"victims.\" The eventual transmission of this highly misleading letter \nwas only halted by an appeal to AAG Fisher. Among those substantive objections \n(which related to far more than the \"time and place\" of the state's sentencing hearing) \nwere: \no Sending the letter would contravene the government's commitment to take no \nposition regarding potential claims of government witnesses. See Tab 39, \nNovember 28, 2008 Email from J. Lefkowitz to J. Sloman. \no The letter cited to an inapplicable statute (the Justice for All Act of 2004) as its \njustification for being sent. Id. AUSA Acosta later conceded that the citation to \nthis statute as a justification was wholly incorrect. \no The letter wrongly advised all recipients that Mr. Epstein would be required to \nregister as \"a sexual predator for the remainder of this life.\" \no The letter amounted to an invitation to civil litigation against Mr. Epstein, \nadvising recipients that they had the right to seek civil damages from Mr. Epstein, \nand in an underlined instruction, stated that if they chose an attorney other than \nthe one chosen by the government they would be required to pay his fees, but if \nthey chose the government's choice, Mr. Epstein would be required to pay the \nfees. \n3. MISCHARACTERIZATION OF OUR ARGUMENTS. \nMr. Sloman's Letter: \n• Mr. Sloman's letter misleadingly characterizes our substantive defense of the \ngovernment's investigation as, \"the investigation merely produced evidence of relatively \ninnocuous sexual conduct with some minors who, unbeknownst to Mr. Epstein, \nmisrepresented their ages.\" \nSee Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 2. \nThe Truth: \n• We never made such a claim. To the contrary, we argued that sworn statements we have \ntaken of the alleged victims demonstrate that law enforcement has presented versions of \ntheir testimony that are necessarily sensationalized and fictionalized. We presented \n3 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012174 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nevidence that Mr. Epstein routinely and daily receives massages from adults. Only a \nsmall percentage of the masseuses turned out to be minors. The majority of those minors \ninterviewed by law enforcement admitted to lying directly to Epstein about their ages \n(not \"unbeknownst to Epstein\"), and inventing further false details to substantiate their \nlies. Indeed, the civil attorney for several of these women admitted at his recent press \nconference that they lied to Mr. Epstein about their ages. Numerous witnesses testified \nthat Mr. Epstein asked that all masseuses be over the age of 18. Further, the evidence is \nundisputed that Mr. Epstein's assistants scheduled the massages and Mr. Epstein did not \nknow which masseuses his assistants had scheduled on a particular day, until the massage \ntook place. We admitted that there was sexual conduct, and argued—not that it was \n\"innocuous\" as Mr. Sloman alleges—but that it was mostly Mr. Epstein's own self-\npleasuring, which did not satisfy the requisite federal element of criminal sexual conduct \n(which is, in turn, defined by state law). These are important distinctions and show that \nMr. Sloman has misrepresented the record about the most basic part of our defense. \n4. SLOMAN DEMANDS AN UNREALISTIC DEADLINE TO COMPLY WITH AN \nAGREEMENT HE UNILATERALLY MODIFIES. \nMr. Sloman's Letter:  \n• \"Unless [Mr. Epstein] complies with all of the terms and conditions of the [Deferred \nProsecution] Agreement, as modified by the United States Attorney's December 19, \n2007 letter to Ms. Sanchez by close of business on Monday, June 2, 2008, the SDFL will \nelect to terminate the Agreement.\" Id., p.1 \nThe Truth:  \n• The Deferred Prosecution Agreement was never modified by U.S. Attorney Acosta's \nDecember 19, 2007 letter. Oddly, Mr. Sloman acknowledges this on page 4 of his May \n19 letter, where he writes that Mr. Acosta \"proposed\" this modification and that \"[Mr. \nLefkowitz] rejected these proposals.\" Thus, Mr. Sloman is threatening to terminate the \nDeferred Prosecution Agreement, unless Mr. Epstein complies with a unilateral \nmodification that Mr. Sloman concedes was never agreed to by defense counsel. \n• Orchestrating the information, plea and sentencing requirements of the Deferred \nProsecution Agreement within the extremely limited two-week timeframe imposed by \nMr. Sloman's June 2, 2008 deadline would have been difficult enough. \n• More importantly, as explained below, the SDFL has refused to provide the defense with \ninformation it requires to enable Mr. Epstein to comply with the additional plea and \nsentencing requirements of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (let alone, by the June 2 \ndeadline arbitrarily imposed by Mr. Sloman). \no The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires Mr. Epstein to plead guilty to and \nbe sentenced for an additional offense which requires that he be registered as a \nsex offender. In different places in his May 19, 2008 letter, Mr. Sloman \n4 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012175 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \ndescribes the additional charge to which Mr. Epstein is required to plead guilty \nunder the Deferred Prosecution Agreement as \"procurement of minors to engage \nin prostitution\" or \"solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution.\" The former \nis an offense for which Mr. Epstein would be required to register, but one for \nwhich the state has no evidence to charge Mr. Epstein and the SDFL refuses or is \nunable to provide evidence that it claims it has. The latter requires no \nregistration, but it is the offense which, over and over again, Ms. Villafana \ninsisted upon including in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, and is one which \nthe State believes is appropriate. The inconsistency between the description of \nthe offense required by the SDFL, the elements of an offense that can be justified \non the facts of this case and the SDFL's requirement that the offense be a \nregistrable one has created substantial confusion. \no As a result of this confusion, in December 2007, both the defense and the state \nrequested that the SDFL provide the factual allegations to enable Mr. Epstein and \nthe State to create a truthful factual recitation of a registrable offense required by \nthe Deferred Prosecution Agreement, but, to date, the SDFL has failed to do so \nwithout any explanation. \n• Mr. Sloman refuses to provide the requested factual allegations, which the State cannot \nfurnish, and now demands a two week deadline to comply. Thus Mr. Sloman has \nunreasonably imposed a deadline with which he himself has made it impossible for Mr. \nEpstein to comply. \n5. WAIVER OF APPEAL TO ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FISHER. \nMr. Sloman's Letter: \n• \"[T]he SDFL provided you with 30 days to appeal the decision to the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral of the United States Alice Fisher\" and \"you chose to forego an appeal to AAG \nFisher.\" \nId., p. 2. \nThe Truth: \n• Mr. Acosta tolled an August 17 deadline, acknowledging that there were \"serious issues\" \nabout the case that needed to be discussed, and scheduled a meeting with the defense for \nSeptember 7, 2007. At the September 7, 2007 meeting, with Drew Oosterbaan in \nattendance, the government dismissed the defense's objections and set a September 21, \n2007 deadline to finalize a non-prosecution agreement or the defense would face an \nalready-drafted 53-page indictment, purportedly identifying 40 minors, with a guideline \nrange of 188 months. \n• Facing Ms. Villafana's threatened draconian indictment, without the claimed offer of the \nright to raise objections in an appeal to AAG Fisher, the defense chose to negotiate an \n5 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012176 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nAgreement to Defer Prosecution to the State, an agreement without precedent and fraught \nwith substantial practical and legal hurdles to its implementation. \n6. THE SDFL DID NOT DEFER TO THE STATE. \nSloman's Letter: \n• \"[T]he SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration.\" \nId., p. 2. \nThe Truth: \n• The SDFL neither deferred to the State, nor even discussed with the State, the length of \nMr. Epstein's incarceration. In a letter to the defense, Criminal Division Chief, Matthew \nMenchel rejected the sentence contemplated by the State's plea agreement, writing that \n\"the federal interest will not be vindicated in the absence of a two-year term of state \nimprisonment.\" See Tab 40, August 3, 2007 Email from M. Menchel. Of course, this \nposition is contrary to Section 9-2031D of the U.S. Attorney's Manual (indicating that \nthe \"result\" of a state prosecution is \"presume[d]\" to have vindicated the federal interest). \nIt is understandable, therefore, that Mr. Sloman might want to retreat from it now. \nIndeed, the final Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) restricts the state-court judge \nfrom exercising any of his rightful discretion and to specifically prohibit the judge from \noffering probation, community control or any other alternative in lieu of incarceration. \nDPA, 2(a). \n7. SUGGESTION OF ADDITIONAL STATE PLEA \nMr. Sloman's Letter: \n• The parties considered: \"as suggested by [the defense], a plea to state charges \nencompassing Epstein's conduct.\" See Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p.2, \nI 2. \nThe Truth: \n• It was the government, and not the defense, that suggested a plea to state charges to \nresolve the federal investigation. Andrew Lourie proposed declining prosecution in favor \nof the state. Although Mr. Epstein and the State Attorney's Office had already reached \na plea agreement, in August 2007, Mr. Sloman and AUSA Marie Villafana warned that \nthey intended to prosecute Epstein federally unless his counsel (i.e., not the U.S. \nAttorney's Office) sought more stringent conditions to the State's proposed plea \nagreement. These stringent conditions included, among other things, the two-year prison \nterm demanded by Mr. Menchel (discussed above) and a charge requiring him to register \nas a sex offender. \n6 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012177 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \n8. ALL IDENTIFIED VICTIMS BE PUT IN SAME POSITION AS IF EPSTEIN \nHAD BEEN TRIED. \nMr. Sloman's Letter: \n• \"The Agreement provides for a method of compensation for the victims such that they \nwould be placed in the same position as if Epstein had been convicted of one of the \nenumerated offenses set forth in Title 18, United States Code Section, 2255.\" \nId. \nThe Truth: \n• Mr. Sloman continues to mischaracterize the highly irregular provisions of the Deferred \nProsecution Agreement. The SDFL did not merely attempt to preserve the compensation \nrights of those it identified as victims; it attempted to create compensation rights for those \nit identified, without imposing on them the burden of proving that they were in fact \nvictims under § 2255. \no In the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the SDFL required Mr. Epstein to waive \nthe right to contest liability under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 as to a list of individuals that \nthe SDFL would not disclose to Mr. Epstein until after he was sentenced and to \npay for an attorney to secure compensation under § 2255 for those undisclosed \nindividuals, or if they decided to sue Mr. Epstein. \no § 2255 ordinarily provides individuals with a right to recover minimum guaranteed \ndamages of $150,000, without having to prove actual damages, only if: (1) they \nwere victims of an enumerated federal offense, including offenses under 18 U.S.C. \n§§ 2422 and 2423, (2) they were minors at the time of the offense, and most \nimportantly (3) they were personally injured as a result of the offense. \no The defense has confirmed examples of women who testified that they were not \nvictims of Mr. Epstein and suffered no personal injury. These women were, \nnevertheless, on the list of \"victims\" identified by the government.. In fact, when \nconfronted with the testimony of a women who denied both being a victim and \nincurring personal injury, Ms. Villafana actually acknowledged such testimony. \nTo justify inclusion of that woman on the government's list, however, Ms. \nVillafana then challenged her own witness's credibility. \n• For this reason, it is false to state that these \"identified\" individuals are in the same \nposition that they would have been had Epstein been convicted at trial. Had there been a \ntrial, Mr. Epstein would have had a right to confront these individuals through cross-\nexamination. Any individual that did not establish that she was a minor victim of conduct \nthat satisfied each element of an enumerated statute under § 2255,or that she suffered \npersonal injury, would not qualify for any treatment under § 2255. However, under the \nDeferred Prosecution Agreement, as an \"identified individual\" on the government's list, \n7 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012178 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nthis same individual would nevertheless be entitled to engage an attorney paid for by Mr. \nEpstein to recover $150,000 of damages from Mr. Epstein under § 2255 without ever \nalleging any injury. In fact, the defense was told that the only question Mr. Epstein \nwould be permitted to ask before paying the girls is \" have you ever met Epstein.\". Thus, \nthe Deferred Prosecution Agreement places identified individuals in a far better position \nthan they would be in if Mr. Epstein were convicted at trial. \n9. ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHT TO SELECT LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE. \nMr. Sloman's Letter: \n• \"Prior to any issues arising concerning the implementation of the 2255 provision, the \nSDFL unilaterally agreed to assign its responsibility to select the attorney representative \nfor the alleged victims to an independent third-party.\" \nSee Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 4, f.3. \nThe Truth: \n• That such an assignment was the SDFL's \"unilateral\" decision is false. Before the \nSDFL decided to assign selection of the \"attorney representative\" to an independent third \nparty, AUSA Marie Villafana had already proposed an \"attorney representative.\" She \nhad proposed local products-liability lawyer, Humberto Ocariz, and claimed he had been \nrecommended by a \"good friend in the Appellate Division.\" Ms. Villafana's account was \nmisleading, as it omitted that this \"good friend\" was her live-in boyfriend, and that Mr. \nOcariz was his former law-school roommate. When we discovered this independently, \nwe objected. Only then did the SDFL propose assigning the selection process to an \nindependent special master and agree to amend the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. \nThus, while it may be true that the SDFL assigned its selection responsibility to avoid the \nappearance of favoritism, it did not do it \"unilaterally,\" but, rather, only after Epstein \nuncovered the Office's misleading disclosure and apparent conflict-of-interest. \n10. TIMETABLE FOR MOVING FORWARD. \nMr. Sloman's Letter: \n• \"On February 25, 2008, I sent you an e-mail setting forth a timetable for moving forward \nin the event that CEOS disagreed with your position. That time is now.\" \nId. , p. 6. \nThe Truth: \n• Mr. Sloman provides only part of the history of this case in order to justify his improper \nactions. He had stated he would close the investigation if CEOS told him to. However, \nCEOS at our very first contact said that under no circumstances did they see that as their \n8 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012179 \nIURKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nrole. They said they would only advise on an abuse of discretion standard. Making the \noutcome a foregone conclusion. Furthermore, in response to the February 25 e-mail, \nwhich attempted to establish a schedule to limit the entire review process (the defense has \nrepeatedly suggested that the misconduct was intertwined with the investigation and \nwould therefore seek higher review), Mr. Lefkowitz e-mailed Mr. Acosta directly. On \nFebruary 29, 2008, Mr. Sloman responded to Mr. Lefkowitz's e-mail to Mr. Acosta, \nstating that Mr. Sloman was acting out of frustration, but \"[p]lease be assured that it has \nnot, and never has been, this Office's intent to interfere or restrict the \"review process\" \nfor either Mr. Epstein or CEOS. I leave it to you and CEOS to figure out how best to \nproceed and will await the results of that process.\" As stated above, CEOS determined \nthat it would not review many of the defense's objections and as to the remainder of those \nobjections, its review would be limited (contrary to Mr. Acosta's assurances), which left \nthe need, supplemented by the defense's subsequent request, for a more thorough review \nof critical issues by others at the Department of Justice. Mr. Sloman's re-imposition of \nthe (albeit modestly extended) timetable was an obvious attempt, in violation of his \nFebruary 29 agreement, to thwart the request made by the defense to the Deputy Attorney \ngeneral, to complete the review process that Mr. Acosta had promised. \n11. \"DELAY.\" \nMr. Sloman's Letter: \n• In a section entitled \"Delay,\" Mr. Sloman states that \"the SDFL again agreed to \naccommodate Epstein's request to appear in state court for plea and sentencing on \nJanuary 4, 2008.\" \nId.,p. 3. \nThe Truth: \n• Curiously, Mr. Sloman fails to mention correspondence from the U.S. Attorney stating \nthat delay of that date would be \"inevitable\" as the defense has raised \"serious questions\" \nabout the propriety of the prosecution. Strikingly, in that same section, Mr. Sloman \nclaims that \"the Agreement did not contemplate a staggered 'plea and sentencing,\" \ndespite quoting, three sentences earlier, from the Agreement's staggered requirement \nthat Epstein plead and be sentenced by October 26, and \"begin serving his sentence not \nlater than January 4, 2008.\" \nWe are, like most attorneys seeking Depai___Luient review, without access to the USAO \nprosecution summaries or other submissions to the Department.

As the CEOS letter points out (CEOS letter at p. 3), I was a member of \nCEOS. In fact, I served as a federal prosecutor for twelve years; five years as an Assistant United \nStates Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, and seven years at CEOS. I began \nworking as a trial attorney for CEOS in 1999, and was promoted to Deputy Chief for Litigation in \n2002, and ultimately to Principal Deputy Chief for the Section in 2004. \nAs those who have worked with me know, I have a history of working diligently on behalf of \nvictims of crime. While at the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of West \nVirginia, I was a part of the prosecution team that prosecuted the first case in the country under the \nfederal Violence Against Women Act. United States v. Bailey, 112 F.3d 758 (4th Cir.), cert denied, \n522 U.S. 896 (1997). The case went to trial and the defendant was sentenced to life in prison. I also \nspearheaded the domestic violence and federal criminal child support prosecution efforts for that \noffice, prosecuting some of the first cases in the country under the federal Child Support Recovery \n1 Citations to the May 15, 2008 correspondence will be referenced herein as \"CEOS letter at p. .\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012183 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 2 \nAct. Later, while at the Department of Justice, I co-authored the Department's Federal Child \nSupport Prosecution Handbook. \nMy work at CEOS permitted me to continue my efforts on behalf of vulnerable victims of \ncrime. While there, for example, I was part of the prosecution team in United States v. Dwight York, \n428 F.3d 1325 (1 1thCir. 2005), cert denied, 548 U.S. 908 (2006). York was the leader of a pseudo \nreligious organization, and systematically molested countless children, some as young as six years \nold. The case went to trial and York was sentenced to 135 years in prison. As part of that trial team, \nI was awarded the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service. Additionally, at CEOS I \nwas one of the architects of the Innocence Lost Initiative, a nationwide initiative designed to combat \nchild prostitution. For this, I was awarded an Assistant Attorney General's Award for Outstanding \nVictim/Witness Service. Likewise, I was awarded a subsequent Assistant Attorney General's Award \nfor Special Initiative in connection with a nationwide sex tourism prosecution initiative I helped to \ndevelop. \nI say all this not for any boastful purpose, but, rather, to make clear that I am fully cognizant \nof victim issues, and that I am no pushover in terms of prosecution standards. I am also very well \naware of the good work of CEOS, and the outstanding credentials of those who toil in that office. \nWith all due respect to CEOS, however (and recognizing that their review of this case was \nquite limited), given the facts and circumstances of this investigation, a federal prosecution of Mr. \nEpstein simply should not be countenanced. In my view, such prosecution would be counter to the \nimportant mandate of the Department of Justice as emblazoned on its seal, \"Qui Pro DominaJustitia \nSequitur,\" referring to the Attorney General\"who prosecutes on behalf of justice.\" \nAs you well know, it is fundamental to that mandate that, as the representative of the people \nof the United States, the duty of a federal prosecutor is not simply to seek conviction as at any cost, \nbut, rather, to seek justice. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). (\"The United States \nAttorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose \nobligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.\") While it is true \nthat Berger was decided at the post-trial, as opposed to the pre-indictment, stage of the case, the \nbedrock principle contained in the above quote should transcend the entire investigation and \nprosecution process. Indeed, it is arguably most imperative at the investigation stage, at which point \nlaw enforcement is dealing with a presumptively innocent citizen. \nIn summary, we understand the allegations against Mr. Epstein to be that Mr. Epstein paid \nindividuals to find friends and acquaintances, certain of whom were under the age of 18, to provide \ntopless massages to him at his Palm Beach home in exchange for money. Mr. Epstein's assistants \nallegedly scheduled these massages for him over the telephone at the direction of Mr. Epstein, \nallegedly including some scheduling calls to underage women. However, the evidence contradicts \nthese allegations. First, Mr. Epstein did not ask that the masseuses be under the aca To the \ncontrary, he specifically asked that they be 18 or older. As one witness commented, said tell \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012184 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 3 \nthem you're 18 because if you're not, he won't let you in his house.\" Ir. at 38-39. \nSecond, Mr. Epstein himself did not schedule such appointments. Third, Mr. Epstein would not \nknow who would be providing a massage at any particular time. Fourth, and importantly, Mr. \nEpstein's assistants were not directed to contact underage women, and were not aware of the true \nages of the women they contacted. In fact, more often than not, the masseuses themselves, or the \nindividuals who introduced the masseuses, made the initial contact. As a result, Mr. Epstein and his \nassistants were routinely unaware of the identities of many of these young women before they \narrived. \nThe allegations further include the assertion that Mr. Epstein engaged in unlawful sexual \nconduct with certain underage women who arrived at his house to provide a massage. At times, \nduring these massages, Mr. Epstein masturbated, engaged in some sexual touching, and a small \nnumber of alleged acts of penetration. However, most of the women who performed massages on \nMr. Epstein were over the age of 18. Many of the young women have sworn under oath that they, in \nfact, told Mr. Epstein that they were 18 or older, and that they did so because they knew that if they \nwere not 18 years old, they would not be allowed into Mr. Epstein's home. In fact, Mr. Epstein has \npassed a polygraph examination to this effect relative to the government's primary, and youngest, \nalleged victim, Indeed, many of the women also worked at local massage parlors, \nwhich presumably had a requirement that the masseuse have reached the age of majority. To the \nextent there are allegations that Mr. Epstein should have been alerted to certain underage women \nbased on conversations he allegedly had with them, those conversations would have taken place in \nperson and at his home, thereby precluding any prior scheduling with knowledge of their true ages. \nAs explained below, any factual allegations of repeat massages with such persons would lack \nnecessary elements required for a federal nexus to such conduct. \nAll of the alleged activity occurred in Mr. Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida. Many of \nthe massages allegedly involved conduct which, even if engaged in, is not proscribed by federal law, \neither because the masseuses were of age, or because conduct with underage masseuses only \ninvolved topless massages, massages in undergarments or naked massages. To the extent prohibited \nsexual activity occurred, any inducement, enticement, and/or persuasion used would have taken \nplace during a face-to-face encounter—thus eliminating the possibility for the commission of a \nfederal crime, which requires the existence of a communication through a facility of interstate \ncommerce in which the defendant persuades or entices the minor to engage in illegal sexual activity. \nFurthermore, any prohibited sexual activity that did occur based on the facts on the record is best left \nto the state to address because the facts of this case do not fall comfortably within the federal \ndomain. \nThis is a case about purely local activity, involving local actors, and affecting local \ninterests and thus, should be handled by local authorities. Nonetheless, the USA() has indicated \nits intent to prosecute Mr. Epstein for purported violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2423, and \n1591. However, as set forth in detail in prior submissions, the facts of this case fall squarely \noutside the heartland of those statutes — in fact, in law, and in congressional intent. As their plain \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012185 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 4 \ntext and history indicate, these statutes were designed to address problems that are truly national \nand international in scope: human trafficking in § 1591; telephone or Internet sexual predation in \n§ 2422; and sex tourism in § 2423. Unlike the alleged conduct at issue here, those problems \nunquestionably present multi-jurisdictional obstacles that States and localities cannot confront \neffectively on their own. Mr. Epstein's conduct was purely local in nature, and the State of \nFlorida and Palm Beach County are effectively prosecuting and punishing that conduct. \nAlthough CEOS asserts, \"that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look precisely like the \ncases that came before it is not dispositive\" (CEOS letter at p. 4), the fact is this case does not look \nanything like those cases. The facts here do not carry any of the hallmarks that typify an appropriate \nfederal prosecution •for child exploitation as reflected in all such prior federal prosecutions. \nSpecifically, the facts here do not carry the hallmarks for a sex trafficking or child prostitution \nprosecution. Mr. Epstein did not target minors. In fact, the evidence indicates just the opposite. \nThere was no travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity. \nThere was no prohibited use of a facility of interstate commerce. There was no commercial for profit \nsexual enterprise. There was no force. There was no violence. There was no use of drugs or \nalcohol. There was no child pornography. \n18 U.S.C. § 1591 is clearly designed to combat organized rings of individuals who engage in \nthe business of human trafficking, involving both a commercial and coercive component. As \nPresident Bush has noted: \ngenerally speaking, trafficking in persons refers to actions, often including the use of \nforce, fraud or coercion, to compel someone into a situation in which he or she will \nbe exploited for sexual purposes, which could include prostitution or pornography, or \nfor labor without compensation, which could include forced or bonded labor . . . \ntrafficking in persons is often linked to organized crime, and the profits from \ntrafficking enterprises help fund other illegal activities. The growth of vast \ntransnational criminal networks supported in part by trafficking in persons fosters \nofficial corruption and threatens the rule of law.2 \nThis in no way describes the case here. Yet the USA() has been unwavering in its single \nminded focus to stretch the limits of these federal statutes beyond their intended use, and beyond \nprecedent, in order to prosecute Mr. Epstein. As the CEOS letter acknowledges, the legal theories \nthe USAO intends to attempt to pursue against Mr. Epstein are \"novel,\" having never before been \nsanctioned by federal law. They should not be sanctioned now. As the Supreme Court recently \npronounced, when a statutory term in a criminal statute could support both a narrow or broad \napplication of the federal criminal law, \"the tie must go to the defendant.\" United States v. Santos, \n553 U. S .______and Cuellar v. United States, 553 U.S_____(June 2, 2008), Slip Op. at 6. \n2 February 25, 2003 Trafficking in Persons National Security Presidential Directive. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012186 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 5 \nA full and fair review of the facts here is critical to this analysis. Yet, it is clear that CEOS \ndid not conduct such a review. In his recent letter to Jay Lefkowitz, First Assistant United States \nAttorney (\"FAUSA\") Jeffrey Sloman confirmed our understanding that the USA() was to have \n\"facilitated\" an \"independent de novo review of the investigation\" by the Department. (May 19, \n2008 Sloman letter at p. 5). Yet, the CEOS review was not complete, and by its own terms not de \nAs CEOS itself noted, \"our review of this case is limited both factually and legally. We have \nnot looked at the entire universe of facts in this case. It is not the role of the Criminal Division to \nconduct a complete factual inquiry from scratch.\" (CEOS letter at p. 1). Indeed, entire subject areas \nrelevant to the inquiry were not considered at all by CEOS. In essence, CEOS was only in a position \nto make the most cursory possible review, an \"abuse of discretion\" review, without considering the \nfacts at the necessary level of detail, and without taking into account the many and varied issues of \nmisconduct we have raised in this case. As the CEOS letter indicates, \"we did not review the facts, \ncircumstances, or terms included in the plea offer nor any allegations that individuals involved in the \ninvestigation engaged in misconduct.\" (CEOS letter at p. 2). All of this begs the question — if it is \nnot CEOS' role to \"conduct a complete factual inquiry,\" and CEOS did not consider any of the \nallegations of misconduct here, which at the very least have created a strong appearance of \nimpropriety, and, at worst evidence an intent and effort to unfairly prejudice Mr. Epstein to the \nfinancial benefit of the friends and colleagues of the prosecution team in the USAO, then where and \nwhen can justice ever hope to be served in this case? This is a prosecution burden that cannot, and \nshould not, be brushed aside. \nWe contend the limited nature of the CEOS review deeply affected its conclusions. For \nexample, CEOS most likely did not review original documents, such as transcripts, and instead relied \non the summaries of federal prosecutors and FBI agents, against whom we have raised serious \nconcerns regarding misconduct. If the summary memos from the USA() are as flawed as other \nUSAO communications have been, and which we have been able to show are misleading and \ninaccurate, the CEOS abuse of discretion review is likely flawed as well. Moreover, although the \nUSAO expected, and personally promised to us, an independent review, FAUSA Sloman's letter also \nmakes clear that our pivotal legal challenge to the use of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) had already \"been \npreviously raised and thoroughly considered and rejected by . .. CEOS prior to\" the recent CEOS \nreview. (May 19, 2008 Sloman letter at p. 5). The fact that CEOS had to evaluate its own decision \nwith respect to some of the allegations against Mr. Epstein prevents its subsequent review and \nopinion from being truly independent. \nFollowing this most recent CEOS review \"limited both factually and legally,\" and with no \ncitation to any case law relative to the statutes in question, CEOS concludes merely, \"federal \nprosecution in this case would not be improper or inappropriate (CEOS letter at p. 5);\" in essence, \nthat the United States Attorney could bring this case in the exercise of his federal discretion should \nhe so choose (\"we conclude that U.S. Attorney Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize \nprosecution in this case.\"). (CEOS letter at p. 2). However, CEOS drew the conclusion that the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012187 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 6 \nfederal prosecution of Mr. Epstein would not be \"improper or inappropriate\" absent any review at all \nof the misconduct here, and absent a full review of the facts and law. The facts, the law, and the \nalleged misconduct are each necessarily inextricably intertwined with the question of whether or not \nthis is a viable federal prosecution. These imposed limits flawed the review from the outset. In any \nevent, CEOS concedes that the defense team makes \"many compelling arguments.\" (CEOS letter at \np. 5). In the end, then, one is left with the impression that the CEOS review and opinion, although \nconcluding that the USA() could push forward at its own discretion, is a much qualified one. \nThe federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein has been a moving target from the inception. Each \ntime the allegations, the witnesses or the applicable law is subject to a searching inquiry, we have \nfound that the allegations have been misrepresented, the law does not apply to the actual facts here, \nand the USA() prosecution theory falls apart. Yet, in the face of the voluminous evidence we have \nsubmitted in this regard, while acknowledging that the theories are \"novel,\" and that our arguments \nagainst federal prosecution are \"compelling,\" CEOS concluded, \"Mr. Acosta could rightfully \nconclude that this federal issue is best resolved by a jury\" and that \"the USA° has a good faith basis \nto fully develop the facts on this issue and brief the law to permit a court to decide whether the law \nappropriately reaches such conduct.\" With all due respect, and recognizing that CEOS may be— and \napparently was — limited in its authority, it should not be the prerogative of the prosecution arm of \nthe United States government to simply roll the dice, and let the court system just sort it out when \ndealing with the life and liberty of a United States citizen. The Department of Justice should not be \nso cavalier when labeling someone as a child molester. While it may be within the discretion of the \nUSA() to do so, it is not in accord with the principles of justice. \nIndeed, as noted, just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court underscored this point in Santos \nand Cuellar. The Court made clear that prosecutorial discretion does not provide the USA() cart \nblanche to expand criminal statutes as they seek to do here with complete disregard for congressional \nintent. The Court rejected speculation as a basis of determining the scope of a criminal statute; \n\"probability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take.\" Slip op. at 7, \nquoting United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76,105 (1820). \"We interpret ambiguous criminal \nstatutes in favor of defendants, not prosecutors.\" Slip op. at 12. \nBased on my experience, I believe that the facts here do not warrant a federal child \nexploitation prosecution. At its core, this case is quintessentially a state concern as opposed to \nimplicating any federal interest. Indeed, the Florida State Attorney's Office (\"SAO\"), led by the \nchief of the Sex Crimes Division, thoroughly investigated this matter, and presented it to the grand \njury. The facts, as opposed to the deeply flawed press reports, were carefully assessed by \nexperienced State prosecutors who aggressively enforce State criminal laws. Following an extensive \n15-month State investigation, Mr. Epstein was indicted by a State grand jury on a single felony count \nof solicitation of prostitution. \nDuring the investigation, the State prosecutor exhaustively reviewed the evidence, met face-\nto-face with many of the alleged victims, considered their credibility — or lack thereof — and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012188 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 7 \nconsidered the extent of exculpatory evidence, including a psychosexual evaluation of Mr. Epstein \nand a polygraph examination demonstrating that Mr. Epstein genuinely believed at the time of the \nalleged conduct that the State's key witness was over the age of 18. Then, after \nmonths of negotiations, the State reached what it believed was an appropriate resolution of the case. \nImportantly, this resolution was consistent with that of cases involving other defendants who had \nengaged in similar conduct. Implementation of the State resolution of the case was held in abeyance, \nhowever, due to the unexpected commencement of the successive federal criminal investigation. \nWhile it is true, as CEOS points out, (CEOS letter at p. 3) that many criminal prosecutions \nturn on issues of credibility of witnesses, to which many members of the defense team can attest \n(having had decades of federal criminal litigation experience among us), this does not serve to divest \nthe prosecutor of his/her duty to make a searching inquiry of the facts before using the power of \nprosecution, and the weight of the United States government, to level serious accusations. CEOS \nlikewise acknowledges as much, \"the prosecutors are in the best position to assess the witnesses' \ncredibility.\" (CEOS letter at p. 3). \nSince the CEOS letter also singles me out as someone who should be familiar with witness \nissues, I feel compelled to note that, of course, I am well aware that it is not uncommon for witnesses \nto give conflicting statements. I am also fully aware that the credibility of key government witnesses \nmay be strongly impacted by the $50 million incentive provided via the civil lawsuits at play, and \nencouraged by the goverrunent here. 3 I have also read many of the conflicts between witness \ntestimony and Detective ReCarey's own rendition of that testimony in his reports and/or search \nwarrant affidavit. Detective ReCarey apparently formed a view early on as to the purported \ncriminality of Mr. Epstein's conduct regardless of the mountain of evidence to the contrary. For a \nprosecutor that has had an opportunity to review the full facts, and to meet with the witnesses, \nhowever, \"conflicting statements\" cross the line to a \"lack of credibility\" that simply can not sustain \na prosecution. That is where an appropriate application of prosecutorial discretion must be brought \nto bear. \nAgain, CEOS was not itself in the position to exercise such discretion. By its own admission, \nCEOS did not make a full review of the witness statements here, and CEOS certainly did not sit \ndown across the table and speak to these witnesses. We understand that was apparently not its \nperceived role. But, CEOS should recognize that at least one prosecutor in this case — the Chief of \nthe SAO Sex Crimes Division has done so. Lana Belohlavek not only met with and interviewed \nthese witnesses during the course of the 15-month state investigation prior to any federal \ninvolvement, but she again sat across the table from many of them in connection with recent civil \n3 It is important to note here that this investigation was launched not upon the complaint of any alleged victim, but, \nrather, upon the complaint of ather, , and her stepmother, More \nnotable still is the fact that has been convicted of federal bank fraud, an has a state \nconviction for identify fraud. Hardly pillars of credibili. Yet, the USAO did not supply this information to the \ndefense. Even more telling is the fact that filed a $50million lawsuit purportedly on behalf of his \ndaughter without her authority or knowledge. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012189 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 8 \n0 \ndepositions in this matter. Ms. Belohlavek, and the SAO, is likewise well familiar with the breadth \nof the federal investigation, and has integrated that knowledge into the current enhanced state \nsentencing recommendation. The SAO remains firm in the position that the proposed state resolution \nis a sound one, and that there was no child exploitation here. Notably, however, not once during the \npendency of the federal investigation has the USA() ever reached out to its state prosecutive \ncounterpart that initiated this investigation in the first place to discuss the issues or to thoroughly \nferret out the facts or the witness credibility issues. \nIn the eight lines the CEOS letter accords to the topic of witness credibility CEOS asserts, \n\"there are multiple mutually-corroborating witnesses,\" (CEOS letter at p. 3). However, the CEOS \nletter does not highlight a single one. In contrast, we have put forth numerous \"mutually \ncorroborating\" witness statements. Far from supporting a federal prosecution, these statements \ninstead corroborate that 1) the alleged victims lied to Mr. Epstein about their age; 2) there was no use \nof a facility of interstate commerce by Mr. Epstein; 3) there was no inducement or coercion; 4) there \nwas no commercial enterprise; and 5) there was no illicit sexual conduct. \nIndeed, Mr. Epstein took several steps to ensure that no minors entered his home, most \nnotably, by affirmatively asking the women whether they were actually 18. See e.g. 'I'r. At \n38-39. That fact — which many of the potential witnesses have confirmed in sworn interviews — \nstrongly indicates that Mr. Epstein specifically intended to preclude anyone under 18 from giving \nhim a massage. That fact is confirmed by, among other things, testimony that \"he \nlikes the girls that are between the ages of like 18 and 20 . . . .\" Tr. at 12. In fact, the \nevidence bears out that the majority of the women who came to Mr. Epstein's residence to provide a \nmassage were over 18. \nMany of the young women who were aged 16 and 17 visited Mr. Epstein's residence only \nonce or twice, and the evidence strongly shows that they lied to Mr. Epstein about their age. Two of \nthese individuals,an, were 14 and 15 at the time they met Mr. \nEpstein. Given that each has brought a civil lawsuit against Mr. Epstein, with and her \nfamily seeking $50 million from Mr. Epstein, their testimony against Mr. Epstein is per se suspect. \nBut, despite their obvious incentive to harm Mr. Epstein, their testimony actually confirms his \ninnocence, for instance, has testified that who introduced her to Mr. \nEpstein, expressly told her to lie to Mr. Epstein about her age. \nQ: And told you that if you weren't 18 Epstein wouldn't let you into his house, \nright? \nA: That's — yes, yes. \n(deposition) at 32. \nQ: You didn't want Mr. Epstein to know that you were lying about your age, right? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012190 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 9 \nA: Correct. \nQ: You didn't want Mr. Epstein to know that you were not 18 yet, right? \nA: Correct. \n(deposition) at 36. \nIn fact, Ms. told Mr. Epstein that she was 18 years old, and confirmed this fact with \nPalm Beach Police. Id. at 36. Beyond that, Ms. \"swore on her mother's grave\" that she \nand Mr. Epstein did not engage in sex of any kind. Tr. (deposition) at 24. She further \nrepeatedly explained that prior to the time she went to Mr. Epstein's house (she went there only \nonce), nobody ever tried to coerce her to engage in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein. Not over the \ntelephone, not over the Internet, not at all. Ir. (deposition) at 31-32. These are not facts \nupon which a federal case can stand. \nMs. s age was also unknown to Mr. Epstein when she went to his home. \n, who was introduced to Mr. Epstein by Ms testified in her federal sworn interview \nthat Ms. old her to lie to Epstein. aggm- Tr. at 8 (\"she just said make sure you're 18 \nbecause Jeffrey doesn't want any underage girls\") (emphasis added). Ms. testimony \nstrongly suggests that Ms. ied to Mr. Epstein about her own age as well. Ms. \nalso self represented that she worked at a local erotic massage parlor that presumably required a \nminimum age. \nThe conduct of is likewise illustrative of \"mutually corroborating\" testimony \nwhich supports the fact that this is not an appropriate federal case. In the same way that Ms. \nwas referred to Mr. Epstein and brought to his home without having been introduced or \nacquainted in any manner, Ms. was referred by someone else, , who also told \nher to lie to Mr. Epstein about her age, which she did. =Tr. at pp. 8-9). \nCEOS seeks to buttress the USA() prosecution by asserting \"it is possible to satisfy that \nelement [proof of specific intent as to the age of the alleged victims] with proof that the defendant \nwas deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest that the person was a minor.\" (CEOS letter \nat p. 2). Such assertion is counter to the law and to the facts. Reliance on a deliberate ignorance \nstandard as to any of the three statutes in issue requires the factual predicate of an intent not to learn \nof an incriminating fact. This is the antithesis of the factual context of this case where there is \nrepeated proof that the minors believed that they had to lie because Mr. Epstein had an actual \npractice of attempting to verify age, and would not let them in his house if they were under the age of \n18. See United States v. Kennard, 472 F.3d 851, 857-858 (11th Cir. 2006), quoting, United States v.  \nPuche, 350 F.3d 1137, 1149 (11th Cir. 2003) (An instruction on deliberate ignorance is appropriate \nonly if it is shown [among other things] . . . that the defendant purposely contrived to avoid learning \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012191 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nRule 19, 2008 \nPage 10 \nof all of the facts in order to have a defense in the event of a subsequent prosecution.\"). Thus, the \nfacts preclude reliance on the concept of deliberate ignorance as a substitute for proof. \nThe fact that the search warrant affidavit in this case is rife with mis-statements and \nomissions regarding the key element of age is critical. However, CEOS concludes with no apparent \nsupporting analysis, \"despite the numerous factual errors you describe, the U.S. Attorney's Office \ncould still plausibly argue that the mistakes — whether inadvertent or intentional — were not material \nto the determination . . . .\" (CEOS letter at p. 3). Although, as CEOS notes, there are \"numerous\" \nsuch misrepresentations, through affirmative statement or intentional omission, a focus on but one of \nthose misrepresentations highlights that such misrepresentations were, in fact, material. The fact is \nthat Detective ReCarey grossly misrepresented Mr. Epstein's intent as it related to the age of the \nwomen he permitted entry to his residence. \nIn the search warrant affidavit, Detective ReCarey affirmed that claimed: \n[Mr. Epstein told her the younger the better. \nAnd, stated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the \nfemale was too old. \nWhat Detective ReCarey, no doubt intentionally, omitted wafurther explanation, \nwhich rendered Mr. Epstein's comments innocuous: \nA: Let me put it this way, he — I tried to bring him a woman who was 23 and he didn't \nreally like it. \nQ: He didn't go for it? \nA: It's not that he didn't go for it. It's just that he didn't care for it. And he likes the \ngirls that are between the ages of 18 and 20. (Statement at 12) (emphasis \nadded). \nHad that critical information, information that turns allegedly illegal conduct into more \ninnocent conduct, been included, it would have seriously undermined the probable cause for the \nsearch warrant. \nSimilarly, and equally problematic, Detective ReCarey did not include the many statements \ndemonstrating that, when asked by Mr. Epstein, the women affirmatively misrepresented their ages \nas being 18, and/or that Mr. Epstein was not aware of their true ages. Indeed, although Detective \nReCarey did note that Ms bid Mr. Epstein that she was 18, he omitted from the affidavit \nthe key point as to why she lied: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012192 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 11 \n=said tell him you're 18 because if you're not, he won't let you in his house. \nSo I said I was 18. As I was giving him a massage, he was like how old are you. \nAnd then I was like 18. But I kind of said it really fast because I didn't want to make \nit sound like I was lying or anything. at 38-39. \nThus, consistent with the guidance provided in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), the \nsearch warrant affidavit in this case reveals knowing and reckless falsehoods and omitted material \ninformation. This is precisely the type the United States Supreme Court sought to guard against. \nThe age of the alleged victims, and of Mr. Epstein's intent in that regard, is an element of the \ncrimes that must be proven in order to sustain a conviction. In particular, § 2422(b) requires that the \ndefendant specifically intended to target a minor. See, e.g., United States v. Murrell, 368 F.3d 1286 \n(11th Cir. 2004) (\"[T]o prove an attempt the government must first prove that [defendant], using the \nintemet, acted with a specific intent to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in \nunlawful sex.\") (Emphasis added). Section 2422(b) expressly requires that the crime be committed \n\"knowingly,\" and that requisite mental element applies as to each element of the crime. United \nStates v. XCitement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 68-69 (1994); United States v. Meek, 366 F.3d 705, \n718 (9th Cir. 2004); United States v. Root, 296 F.3d 1222, 1227 (11th Cir. 2002); United States v.  \nBailey, 228 F.3d 637, 638-639 (6th Cir. 2000). How, then, could the USA() \"plausibly argue\" that a \nmisrepresentation about an element of the crime could be viewed as \"not material\"? If the elements \nof the alleged crime are not met, there is no probable cause to sustain the search warrant in the first \ninstance. If the elements are not met, there is no federal crime. That is material. \nMoreover, it is clear from the plaint text of the statute that the statutorily proscribed act \npursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2422(b) is the actual use of a facility of interstate commerce to persuade, \nentice, induce, or coerce. \"The underlying criminal conduct Congress expressly proscribed in passing \n§2422(b) is the persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of the minor rather than the sex act \nitself. That is, if a person persuaded a minor to engage in sexual conduct (e.g., with himself or a third \nparty) without then committing any sex act himself, he would nevertheless violate §2422(b).\" United \nStates v. Murrell, 368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir. 2004). See also, United States v. Bailey, 228 F.3d \n637, 639 (6th Cir. 2000) (\"Congress has made a clear choice to criminalize persuasion and the \nattempt to persuade, not the performance of the sexual acts themselves.\"). Thus, if there has been \nsexual misconduct (which we deny) without the requisite persuasion, there is no violation of this \nfederal law. \nThe investigation and testimony in this case makes clear that Mr. Epstein did not use any \nfacility of interstate commerce to commit any act forbidden by 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b)—to persuade, \ninduce, entice, coerce—nor did he direct any of his assistants to do so. Indeed, by way of example, \nas clear on this point at her deposition during which she repeatedly testified that \nnobody—not Mr. Epstein or any of his assistants—ever used the Internet or phone in any way to try \nto persuade her to engage in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein. (deposition) at 31-32. \nNonetheless, even assuming, arguendo, that persuasion to engage in sexual conduct occurred over \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012193 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 12 \nthe telephone (which we deny), it is black letter law that the mens rea must coincide with the actus \nreus. Thus, the government must prove that Mr. Epstein has the specific intent to target a known \nminor to engage in prohibited sexual activity at the time of the call. We have seen zero evidence of \nthis. To the extent Mr. Epstein later may have persuaded a particular individual to engage in \nunlawful sexual activity during a massage, such persuasion occurred face to face, and can not work \nretroactively to render the earlier phone call an offense under the statute. \nAs to the purported violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 for allegedly traveling in interstate \ncommerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity, CEOS does not deny that Mr. Epstein \nwas returning to one of his residences when he traveled to Florida!' CEOS explicitly stated it \"fully \nunderstand[s] our argument\" (CEOS letter at p.2) that Mr. Epstein should not be charged under \n§ 2423(b) because the dominant purpose for his traveling to Palm Beach was not to engage in illegal \nsexual activity, but to simply return to one of his residences. Rather, this is apparently another \n\"compelling\" point of law which may be left to \"a court to decide whether the law properly reaches \nsuch conduct.\" (CEOS letter at p. 2).5 Notably, implicit in this concession by CEOS is that the law \nhas never before been so applied, that is, there is no precedent for a court to extend the statute as the \nUSA() seeks to do here. In fact, the United States Supreme Court prohibited the criminalization of \ntravel under identical circumstances over a half century ago. See Mortenson v. United States, 322 \nU.S. 369, 374 (1944) (intention to engage in proscribed conduct must \"exist before the conclusion of \nthe interstate journey and must be the domMate motive of such interstate movement.\" (Emphasis \nadded.) \nBeyond an absence of proof regarding the travel element in connection with 18 U.S.C. §2423, \nthe requisite age requirement for a violation of that statute is important. 18 U.S.C. §2423, by \nreference to Chapter 109A (18 U.S.C. §2423(0(1)), specifically defines a minor for purposes of that \nstatute as an individual who has not attained the age of 16. If an alleged victim is 16 years of age or \nolder, a violation of this statute pursuant to 2423(f)(1) can only occur if it can be proven that force, \nthreat or drugs were involved. See, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241 et seq. There are no such allegations here. As \na result, in order to find a violation under 18 U.S.C. § 2423, the United States would have to prove \nthat Mr. Epstein engaged in one of the sexual acts defined at 18 U.S.C. § 2246(2) with an individual \nunder the age of 16, and that he formed the intent and dominant purpose to do so prior to the time he \nmade a return trip to Florida. Again, there is no such evidence here. has specifically \ntestified that 1) she never engaged in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein; 2) she never even met or \ntalked to Mr. Epstein prior to her arrival at his house; and 3) she lied about her age not only to Mr. \nEpstein, but, in fact, to the world on her MySpace page when she said that she was 18 years old. It is, \nthen, also worth noting in this regard that 18 U.S.C. §§2243(c) provides an affirmative defense if \nproven by a preponderance of the evidence if Mr. Epstein reasonably believed that was \n4 In addition to his residence there, Mr. Epstein also has several businesses, and personal matters and contacts to which \nhe attends in Florida. For example, beginning in 2002, Mr. Epstein visited his mother nearly every weekend in Palm \nBeach until she passed away in April, 2004. \n5 As previously set forth herein, and as more fully explained in other submissions related to this case, the recent \nSupreme Court decisions in Santos and Cuellar make this attempted stretch of the law improper. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012194 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 13 \nhad attained the requisite legal age. Finally, although 18 U.S.C. §2423(f)(2) also defines \"illicit \nsexual conduct\" as any commercial sex act with a person under the age of 18, 18 U.S.C. §2423(g) \nalso provides a specific affirmative defense as to that age element if proven by a preponderance of \nthe evidence that Mr. Epstein reasonably believed that the young women had attained the requisite \nlegal age. As we have demonstrated, time and again the women involved lied to Mr. Epstein as to \nilleir true age, representing that they were, in fact, over the age of 18. Many of them also represented \nthat they worked at local massage parlors, which presumably would have imposed a legal age \nrequirement. \nLastly, in contrast to 18 U.S.C. §1591, Mr. Epstein's conduct did not involve trafficking of \nwomen or children in the sex industry, and was not part of any phenomenon that, in the aggregate, \nhad an economic impact on interstate or foreign commerce. Additionally, Mr. Epstein did not \nbenefit financially from the alleged conduct. Therefore, as the SAO determined, and still believes, \nMr. Epstein was a customer, a \"John\" for whom prosecutions are best left to the State to address. \nIndeed, there is no reported precedent extending federal law to a local \"John\" who does not violate \nthe child exploitation statutes. Indeed, CEOS does not point to a single case where federal \nprosecutors have used § 1591 in a case involving facts like these. Instead, every § 1591 prosecution \nhas involved national or international sex trafficking and/or for-profit prostitution rings, involving \nthe knowing use of minors and/or forcible coercion, or forcible rape, physical abuse or intimidation. \nThese are the elements required by the statute, and they are not met here. \nAlthough CEOS could, perhaps, point to United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176 (11th Cir. \n2007) as a case that, standing alone, involved wholly intrastate conduct, the facts of that case are far \ndifferent in key respects than this one. The Evans case involved both the commercial and coercive \ncomponents that Congress, and administration policy statements intended in 18 U.S.C. § 1591 \nprosecutions. Evans, and his co-conspirators (Madison and Yearby) were not \"Johns.\" They \noperated a for profit prostitution ring marked by control of, and extreme violence toward, the \nvictims, who they knew were underage. Indeed, Evans forced one such victim, age 14 years old, to \ncontinue to work even after she had been hospitalized with ADDS. As part of their business, Evans \nand his co-conspirators provided the victims with cell phones, hotels, and condoms, and the victims \nwere forced to give all of their money from this prostitution ring to Evans and his co-conspirators. \nNone of this type of activity comes close to the facts regarding Mr. Epstein. Finally, but significantly, \nthe prostitution ring in Evans was not, in fact, entirely intrastate as the companion case of one of the \nEvans co-defendants makes clear. See, United States v. Madison, 477 F.3d 1312, 1313-1314 (11th \nCir. 2007) (Jane Doe #2 stated that she traveled to Atlanta, Georgia with Madison to work as a \nprostitute). \nThus, courts, including the Eleventh Circuit in Evans, have underscored the point that § 1591 \nsimply is not intended to cover the kind of alleged conduct at issue here. \"Section 1591 does not \ncriminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice traditionally governed by state regulation). Rather, its \nreach is limited to sex trafficking that involves children or is accomplished by force, fraud, or \ncoercion.\" United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d at 1179 n. 1; See also United States v. Sims, 171 Fed. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012195 \nALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC \nMr. John Roth \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 14 \nAppx. 849, 2006 WL 14581 at *3 (11th Cir. 2006) (to establish Sims's guilt on the sex trafficking of \na minor count, the government had to show that Sims benefited financially from Owen's sexual \nactivity and that Sims knew that (a) force or coercion would be used to cause Owens to engage in a \ncriminal sex act or (b) that Owens was under the age of 18.) (emphasis added). Again, none of these \nfactors is present in this case. The Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of the statute makes perfect \nsense: were § 1591 not limited in this fashion, it would threaten to criminalize a host of localized \nbehavior that has nothing to do with human trafficking, and, thus, is of no valid federal interest. \nIn sum, to accord discretion to the USAO, albeit without benefit of the requested full denovo \nreview, to exercise authority to pursue a prosecution which involves a \"novel\" application of three \nfederal statutes in the face of numerous \"compelling arguments\" is not warranted, as it is not \nsupported by the facts, the law, or justice. Echoing the admonition of the Supreme Court in the \nBerger decision, the Comment to Rule 3.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (Special \nResponsibilities of a Prosecutor), says it best \"A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of \njustice and not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to \nsee that a defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of \nsufficient evidence.\" This is a responsibility that can not be taken for granted. The government bears \nthe burden of assuring that it possesses sufficient evidence to prove each element of a crime with \nrespect to some specific victim before publicly branding Mr. Epstein a child molester. In this case, \nhowever, the USA() has not met its burden for any victim for any of the crimes alleged. It is not \nenough to simply gloss over the required proof, and rely on the jury or the court to just sort it all out \nin the end. The stakes are too high. As a result, the USA() should not be permitted to pursue an \nunfounded federal criminal case against Mr. Epstein under the guise of prosecutorial discretion. \nSuch prosecution in this case necessarily would appear to be selective to Mr. Epstein. To be \nclear, our request that Mr. Epstein should not be prosecuted federally would not permit him to go \ncompletely unpunished, but, rather, would simply place him in the same prosecution position as \nothers similarly situated. Therefore, we continue to believe that after a complete, de novo, and \nindependent review, the only appropriate conclusion will be that this case is best left to the state to \nresolve. \nSTEPHANIE D.
