Globalisation had lifted billions from\npoverty and the logic of free trade and capital flows\nwas accepted from Beijing to Zanzibar. But in 2007,\nwhen the North Atlantic financial crisis revealed the\nflaws of excessive financialisation, doubts about\nglobalisation began to creep in.\n\nGlobalisation, in the form of the spread oftrade,\nmoney, people and information, is inevitable,\nessentially because of expanding demographics and\ntechnology. Human beings migrate all over the\nworld, and it was technology -—the invention of\nrailways, ships, planes and nowinformation\ncommunications -— that accelerated the spread of\nglobal ideas and genes.\n\nAs Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, author of\nGlobalisation and Its Discontents, aptly put it,\nglobalisation is either positive or negative,\ndepending on howitis managed.\n\nLike any national system, the system works well\nwith someone providing public goods.\n\nThe internet is such a public good. It gave even\nthe most remote people and places access to global\nknowledge, thus making the world more inclusive.\nButifand when the masses cannot benefit from\nsuch access, technology and globalisation can\nwiden inequalities, giving rise to anger, frustration\nand the rise of populist sentiments.\n\nThe reality is that globalisation cannot be\nstopped. But it can be managed better. The issues\nthat arouse anti-globalists can and should be\nmanaged. These are the interrelated issues of\nclimate change, disruptive technology, human\nmigration and toxic politics.\n\nBeing a businessman, Donald Trump’s basic\ninstinct is to manage these issues bilaterally, which\nis why intuitively he does not like multilateral groups\nlike the World Trade Organisation. But these\nmultilateral institutions provide exactly the global\npublic goods that make globalisation positive rather\nthan damaging. What is fair to a behemoth that\naccounts for 22 per cent of world gross domestic\nproduct may not be fair to a small bilateral trading\npartner one-tenth its size. The world’s multilateral\nrules, which took years to negotiate, are there\nbecause they bind everyone, large or small, to global\nmutual benefit and shared stability.\n\nWhat does President Xi Jinping’s (231-7)\ncommitment to globalisation in Davos in January\nreally mean? There are several guiding principles\nbehind that gesture.\n\nFirst, there is Chinese recognition that global\nproblems like climate change, disruptive\ntechnology and human migration involve costs that\ncan only be solved from new resources generated\nthrough growth in trade and investments.\n\nSecond, China doesn’t see globalisation as a\nzero-sum game, but one where there can be benefits\nfor all, provided the downsides are managed ona\nmutually shared basis, according to mutually agreed\nmultilateral rules.\n\nThird, accounting for only 15 per cent of world\nGDP, China onits own cannot push globalisation. It\nmust work with the current advanced economies\nlike Europe (25 per cent of world GDP), Japan (6 per\ncent) and others.\n\nFourth, to be realistic, China’s contribution to\nglobalisation must work on the principle of\ncomparative advantage. Being alatecomer to\nglobalisation, China has considerable first-hand\nexperience in building infrastructure, supply chains\nand urban conglomeration under third-world\nconditions. Its comparative advantage is based on\nthe adaptation of modern technology, such as\ninternet platforms, to lower trading and transaction\ncosts. India, Kenya and other emerging markets are\nalso moving in the same direction.\n\nInshort, to promote the good side of\nglobalisation, we must apply 21st-century tools and\nexperience to manage 21st-century problems.\nGoing forward, the complexity is that Trump is\npushing the leading economy to swing froma major\ncontributor of global public goods to a “taxer” on\nglobalisation. That is the true meaning of the border\ntax and the chiding of allies that they need to\ncontribute to any bilateral efforts in defence or in the\nbuilding of walls. But America works on the basis of\nfreely importing resources and talent way in excess\nof domestic production. That manifests itself in its\nlarger and larger current account and fiscal deficits\nand its growing global debt.\n\nWhich is why everyone prays that saner heads\nwill prevail in America’s commitment to\nglobalisation. “America first” cannot operate on the\nbasis of everyone else loses. Just as business is too\nimportant to be leftto businessmen, globalisation is\ntoo important to be left to its discontents.\n\nAndrew Sheng writes on global issues\nfrom an Asian perspective\n\nAsection of a border fence separating the US and\nMexico is under construction.

If\nyou have an idea for an opinion article,\nemail it to oped@scmp.com\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn says China’s ‘two sessions’ underlines the non-negotiable nature of Xi’s status as core leader\n\nhe “two sessions” in Beijing the annual\n\nmeetings of the National People’s\n\nCongress and the Chinese People’s\n\nPolitical Consultative Conference -— offer\n\nsome sense and insight about China’s\ngovernance. Attending them this year, I have come\naway with several impressions.\n\nOne is the conjunction of two ways of thinking\nthat Westerners would deem incompatible: stricter\nconformity and enforcement of political orthodoxy,\nand greater freedom and encouragement to critique\ngovernment programmes. To understand China’s\nsystem of governance, especially under President Xi\nJinping (2217), now the “core” of the Chinese Com-\nmunist Party, is to appreciate why these two ways of\nthinking are deemed complementary, not contra-\ndictory. China’s leadership recognises that it needs\nthe wisdom of society, especially the expertise of the\nintellectual elite, to critique and improve govern-\nment, but the concern is that such criticism could be\ndestabilising. Hence the political controls to enable\nthe criticism.\n\nChina watchers scrutinise everything going on\nhere — work reports, press conferences, policy\nannouncements, personnel moves, sideline com-\nments, even seating arrangements. Which policies\nare stressed? What signals are sent? Any surprises?\nWhat's “in the air”?\n\nListening to Premier Li Keqiang (45238) give the\nannual government work report to the nearly 3,000\nNPC delegates assembled in the Great Hall of the\nPeople, one is struck by the civilisation-state\npageantry of China state power and the sheer magni-\ntude of managing this huge country. One must\ncomprehend the country as a whole, integrating\npolitical, social, cultural and ecological sectors with\nthe economy. To focus only on the economy is to\ndistort thelens with which to view China.\n\nTothe untrained eye, the structure and phrases of\nwork reports look similar to those of previous years.\nButlook closely and one sees the small butrevelatory\ndifferences.\n\nChina’s ruling party prides itself on careful, incre-\nmental change, and usually this is the case. But occa-\nsionally we catch sharper breaks with past practice.\nThis year, three aspects stand out: reform, innova-\ntion and, most significantly, Xi’s leadership.\n\nFirst, while reform has long been a key feature of\ngovernment work reports, the pervasiveness of\nreform this year makes it special. Almost every sec-\ntion is founded on reform. Regarding the economy,\n“supply-side structural reform” is the well-known\nwatchword, and the report calls for cutting industrial\novercapacity, reducing urban real estate inventory,\ndeleveraging Chinese firms by decreasing debt, and\ncutting costs for doing business. All this I expected.\n\nWhat! did not expect was the specificity of direc-\ntives for cutting costs — with five detailed prescrip-\n\ntions, such as reducing a blizzard of government-\nimposed fees, about which entrepreneurs have been\ncomplaining loudly. Reform affects almost every\naspect of society, including the household registra-\ntion system (hukou), health care, environmental\nprotection, intellectual property rights and stream-\nlining government bureaucracy.\n\nInnovation is stressed for industrial transforma-\ntion — not simply platitudes promoting science and\ntechnology but practical steps, such as enabling\nuniversities and research institutes to “operate with\nautonomy” and to implement “incentive policies\nlike stocks, options and dividends”.\n\nIt could hardly be clearer that China’s “socialism\nwith Chinese characteristics” continues to separate\nitself from the failed forms of 19th-century socialism\nthat founded the old Soviet Union and was passed to\nChina prior to the reforms of Deng Xiaoping (S/F).\nThe pervasiveness of reform and the call for innova-\n\nOne must comprehend\nthe country as a whole...\nTo focus only on the\neconomy is to distort\nthe lens with which\n\nto view China\n\ntion are the product of Xi’s leadership, which is what\nreally marked the two sessions. In his work report,\nPremier Li pledged to implement “General Secretary\nXi Jinping’s major addresses and his new vision,\nthinking and strategies for China’s governance”, and\nthe “four-pronged comprehensive strategy”, the\npolitical theory that Xi unveiled in 2015.\n\nOne need not be a China hand to see that Xi’s\n“four comprehensives” — to build a moderately\nprosperous society, deepenreform, advance thelaw-\nbased governance of China, and strengthen party\nself-governance—has been elevated to a foundation-\naltheory of the state. In the theory section ofthe work\nreport, Xi’s contributions take up 39 words in the\nEnglish translation, more than double the theories of\nformer leaders Deng, Jiang Zemin (2) and Hu\nJintao (4833), which collectively take up 18 words.\n\nSeparately, while “Marxism-Leninism” and\n“Mao Zedong thought” were duly noted in the draft\ngeneral provisions of civil law, the famous phrases\ndidn’t make the more important government work\nreport. I doubt the cut was made to save space.\n\nThe significance of Xi’s role as China’s pre-\neminent leader is that it provides political stability\n\nand coherent policies, such that the crucial 19th\nparty congress, forthcoming in the autumn, should\nplay out according to expectations. My take from\nspeaking with delegates is that Xi’s leadership posi-\ntion as core of the party is confirmed and enhanced.\nThis means that China can focus on the hard tasks of\nenhancing reform and transforming the economy.\n\nOne other development is notable: the NPC is\nbecoming more an empowered deliberative body\nand less a “rubber stamp” cheerleader. An example\nof this is the multifaceted process of constructing a\ncomprehensive civil code, targeted for 2020. After\nthree revisions, the general provisions of civil law\nfinally provides a framework for codifying some 200\ncivil and commercial laws in constructing a legal\nsystem to serve civil society. The NPC’s growing\nconfidence to disclose disputes and to allow, indeed\nto encourage, debates is promising.\n\nAnd what of Xi’s anti-corruption drive? Foreign\nmedia typically assume that the drive reflects a\npower struggle among leaders and factions, while\nsome Chinese officials claim that it has nothing to do\nwith political struggle.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for the campaign, of\ncourse. More incisively, we can see how the cam-\npaign has been energised by Xi’s “four comprehen-\nsives” political theory. One, realising a moderately\nprosperous society is hindered by corruption; two,\nreform is resisted by corrupt officials who protect\ntheir illicit financial benefits; three, the drive exem-\nplifies therule oflaw; four, strictly governing the party\ncould be defined as anti-corruption.\n\nA few of the now-caged “tigers” were convicted of\n“seriously violating the party's political discipline”\n“banding together in gangs and forming factions”,\nand conducting “non-organisational political activi-\nties” —anotvery veiled code-phrase for attempting to\nundermine China’s leadership. By eliminating these\npolitical threats, the anti-corruption campaign helps\nensure political stability, especially as the country\nenters the final run-up to the 19th party congress.\n\nThere is now no ambiguity: China is under the\nfirm leadership of the party’s Central Committee,\nwith Xias its core, and alignment with Xi’s “four con-\nfidences” doctrine - in which officials are urged to be\n“confident in China’s chosen path, political system,\nguiding theories, and culture” —is non-negotiable.\n\nMany areas of society and government are open\nto debate, butnotthe core principles and notthe core\nleader. These have been decided and conformity is\nexpected. Only with such unity can the “four com-\nprehensives” bring about the great rejuvenation of\nthe Chinese nation and realise the Chinese dream.\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn is a public intellectual, political/\neconomics commentator, and an international\ncorporate strategist.
