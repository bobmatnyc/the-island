  "text": "of dependence upon God for what one is,\nHowever, long one exists.” A human\nbeing therefore depends upon God for\nmore than the fact of his or her birth: he\nor she remains dependent upon God in\nthe same way ever after. God’s creation\nof the world in general is simply not\ntemporally indexed; it is no more closely\nassociated with the beginning of things\nthan with what comes later. A\npreoccupation with temporal origins\ntherefore commonly drops out of\nChristian accounts of creation: the world\nis just as dependent upon God for its\nexistence whether it has a beginning or\nalways exists.” Belief in God’s creation\nof the world for these reasons blurs into\nbelief in God’s supportive maintenance\nof it at every point in time.\n\nAlso enabling belief in God as\ncreator to form a general backdrop to all\none’s experience—to be relevant on\nevery occasion as a universally\napplicable worldview--is the fact that\nGod is thought to be responsible as\ncreator for the whole of what happens in\nthe world at any one time. To believe\nthat God is the creator of the world is at\nthe very least to believe that God holds\ninto existence the entirety of the world in\nany and all respects in which it is good.\nIn the case of one’s own life, therefore,\nevery aspect of value at every moment—\none’s existence, fine qualities and\ncapacities, enjoyments and\nachievements, beneficial connections\nwith natural and social environments,\nand so on—is to be attributed to God’s\nagency as creator. While there is a good\ndeal of disagreement within Christianity\non this matter, Christians, moreover, not\nuncommonly affirm that God is equally\nbehind the bad things that happen, at\nleast insofar as those bad things can be\nturned to good account--for example,\nharm suffered turned into a salutary\n\n122\n\nPage\n\npedagogical correction, just punishment\nfor sin, the necessary testing of one’s\nfaith, or simply a beneficial form of\nsympathy with God’s own suffering on\nthe cross. For both the general reasons\njust mentioned—because of its holism\nand temporal inclusiveness--belief in\nGod as the creator of the world\nencourages love, gratitude, and trust\ntoward God, and toward the world that\nGod brings about, as constant Christian\ndispositions, basic Christian attitudes of\nwide-ranging applicability, whatever\nmight be going on in one’s life.\n\nSocial Connectedness and Invisibility\n\nThe same all-inclusive causal\ndependence upon God at all times is\nwhat ensures individuals are never left\non their own, never abandoned to their\nown devices. Christian theologians\n(especially in the Protestant tradition)\nusually develop the psychological\nimplications of this in terms of avoiding\neither anxious or arrogant self-\nconcern.” According to this theology,\none does not believe he or she ever\noperates independently of God.\nTherefore, one should never attribute\nsuccesses and achievements in a prideful\nway to oneself, but rather one should\nalways give the glory to God as their\nultimate source. For the same reason,\none should never despair of failings, as if\none’s own inadequacies were the last\nword; one believes a supremely\npowerful and loving influence, God,\nremains an operative force in one’s life,\nHowever, desperate the situation\notherwise appears to be from the\nstandpoint of one’s own powers and\ncapacities to improve one’s lot in life.\n\nBy discouraging isolated self-\nregard or self-understanding generally,\nthe same nexus of Christian ideas about\nGod as creator has clear consequences\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021368",
