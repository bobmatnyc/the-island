  "text": "Al Pacino and David Mamet were huddled on\na couch as Spike Lee and Meredith Vieira sat\nnearby listening.\n\nAt Warner Bros’ fancy private dinner for its\nnominees at the Bel Air Hotel, Nicky and I were\ngreeted by David Heyman. Executives Sue Kroll\nand Juli Goodwin brought us over to Sandra\nBullock and CEO Kevin Tsujihara. Again,\neveryone whispered, “Who is winning Best\nPicture?” Gravity's technical wizardry, revered in\nL.A., was now thought to have the edge.\n\nSpike Jones arrived and was too superstitious\nto discuss his chances for Best Original Screenplay\nfor Her. He won. Don't worry about Blue Jasmine\nfellow nominee Woody Allen; he was tap dancing\nwith Susan Stroman on Broadway, rehearsing\nBullets Over Broadway. As a man who doesnt\nbelieve in campaigning for awards, he just might\nshow up to collect a few Tonys.\n\nAn exhausted Alfonso Cuarén was the last to\nappear, with girlfriend Sheherazade Goldsmith.\nHe was fighting a cold and couldn't wait to get\nback to real, not reel, life.\n\nBrad Grey’s party for Paramount’s nominees\nwas in full swing at Spago Beverly Hills. The Wolf\nof Wall Street’s Marty Scorsese was huddled in\na booth with Brad, marketing maven Megan\nColligan, producer Irwin Winkler, and the\nageless Don Rickles. Jonah Hill’s buddy\nLeonardo DiCaprio had just left, as he was\ngetting a cold too, but he later showed up at the\nBel Air, where Marty was staying, to have drinks\n\n&\n“\n\na al Cannes, was finally over.\n\nwith Scorsese and Cuaron in the bar.\nNebraska talent Bruce Dern, Will\nForte, June Squibb, cinematographer\nPhedon\nscreenwriter Bob Nelson relaxed\n\nPapamichael and\nsince their grueling nine-month\n\ncampaign, which had begun at\nhale Ron vice\nchairman of Universal,\n\nMeyer,\n\nhad his annual private\n/ party at his Malibu home\nEB —  inhonor of Graydon Carter.\nBarbra Streisand, Jim Brolin,\nJohn Travolta, Kelly Preston,\nif Diane Lane, Robert Downey Jr.,\nand Paul Rudd mingled under a\ntent with interior designer Sandy\nGallin and his new husband\nBryan Fox. Ron's daughter,\njewelry designer Jennifer Meyer,\ncame alone. It was nanny’s\nnight off, so her husband Tobey\nMaguire stayed home with the\nkids.\n\nLarry Gagosian gave his 17th\n\nLara\n\nannual art opening and dinner,\nSpencer\n\nwhich is always a hot ticket for the rich and\nhip. This year, art photographer Taryn Simon\nmounted a show titled “Birds of the West Indies”\nafter the seminal taxonomy by ornithologist\nJames Bond. The exhibition also chronicled the\nwomen, weapons, and cars depicted in the Bond\nfilms, in addition to the birds that appear in all 24\nmovies. Even MGM couldnt dream this up.\n\nDinner followed next door at Mr. Chow’s,\ncomplete with Eva and Michael Chow. Simon’s\nfilmmaker husband Jake Paltrow brought his\nmother Blythe Danner and his sister Gwyneth.\n\nSince the Spielbergs and the Paltrows are\nclose family friends, Kate Capshaw arrived with\nTheo and Sasha Spielberg. Jared Leto came\nwith Terry Richardson. Adrien Brody, Elle\nFanning, Cameron Diaz, John Waters, and\nRobbie Robertson chowed down. Power\ncollectors Eli and Edythe Broad and Bill\nand Maria Bell split chopsticks.\n\nAfter dinner, we migrated to Gagosian’s\nhome. It was raining, it was windy, and\nit was cold. Teetotaler Robbie Robertson\nslipped on wet stone outside the house. He\nwas taken to the hospital that night and\nendured a two-hour operation on three\nbroken ankle bones. Simultaneously,\nNicky Haslam slipped onto a glass table | *\nand crashed to the floor. Nicky was fine; <\nthe table was a goner—so much excitement\nfor one night.\n\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28\nWoke up this morning and the eye problem\nhad reached epic proportions as my left eye\nwas now shut. Found an eye doctor to lance the\ninfected eyelid. He gave me enough drugs to get\nme to the Publicist Guild lunch at the Beverly\nWilshire Hotel.\na Lifetime Achievement Award from\n\nJerry Lewis was receiving\nCarol\nBurnett. Thankfully, I only needed one eye to\ntake all that in.\n\nAt her uncle’s Rodeo Drive store, Roberta\nArmani toasted fellow Italians Marty Scorsese\nand Paolo Sorrentino. The suits Leo wore in\nThe Wolf of Wall Street were designed for him by\nArmani himself.\n\nPaolo Sorrentino was the overwhelming\nfavorite to win Best Foreign Film for his Fellini-\ninspired The Great Beauty, and indeed he won.\n\nArmani’s talent turnout was very impressive.\nCate Blanchett, who has signed with the designer\nas the face of his perfume, was there with Glenn\nClose, Robert DeNiro, and Samuel L. Jackson.\nAll were bedecked in Armani.\n\nWanda McDaniel, the marketing guru for\nArmani, was the very first to dress actresses on\nthe red carpet. Jodie Foster was her muse and\nthat was 25 years ago.\n\nay\ni\n\nBette Midler\n\n,\n\nso\n\nLaura Dern, Bruce Dern\nand Andrea Beckett\n\nAPRIL 2012 * AVENUE MAGAZINE | 57\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010720",
