He was not entirely naive about its capabilities. During\nhis service in the CIA, he had taken a monthlong training course at\nthe CIA’s “farm” at Fort Peary, in which counterintelligence offi-\ncers taught about the capabilities of the Russian security services. He\ncouldn’t have believed that Russia would allow a defector from the\nNSA who claimed to have had access to the NSA’s sources in Russia\nand China to leave Moscow before its security services obtained that\ninformation.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a defector to change sides in order to find\na better life for himself in another country. Some defectors flee to\nescape a repressive government or to find one in which they believe\nthey are more closely attuned to its values. Russia, however, is ordi-\nnarily not the country of choice for someone such as Snowden seek-\n\n© ing greater civil liberties and personal freedom. So why did Snowden ©\nchoose Russia for his new life?\n\nThe four choices just discussed that Snowden made, taken to-\ngether, show that Snowden was determined to succeed where others\nbefore him had failed. He not only wanted to take full credit for\nstealing files from the NSA but also wanted to escape any American\nretribution for his act. His decision suggests to me a highly intelli-\ngent, carefully calculating man who was hell-bent on finding a new\nlife for himself in a foreign country. A common thread that runs\nthrough these four choices is a willingness to do whatever was nec-\nessary to achieve this new life, including disregarding his oath to\nprotect secrets and instead transporting them on thumb drives to\na foreign country. To protect himself, he was also willing to rely on\nthe influence of adversary intelligence services in Hong Kong and\nput himself in the hands of Russian authorities in Moscow. He was\nalso willing to use some of his classified documents as a medium of\nexchange, if not bait, with journalists to get the public attention he\nsought.\n\nThese choices paid off for Snowden, the new hero of millions.
