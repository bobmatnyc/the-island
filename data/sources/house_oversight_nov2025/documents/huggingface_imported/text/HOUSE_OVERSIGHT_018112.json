Either case could eventually involve Syria.\nHizballah can now strike targets throughout Israel. Its missiles and\nrockets are also accurate enough to hit military installations and other\nimportant facilities, and it can fire as many as 500—600 per day.\nHizballah also has the ability to conduct terrorist or special\noperations against civilian, military and infrastructure targets outside\nthe immediate theater of war. Sheikh Nasrallah has plausibly\nthreatened to attack shipping in the eastern Mediterranean in the\nevent of a conflict with Israel.12 If Hizballah were to gain access to\nSyria’s P-800 Yakhont supersonic cruise missile system—a distinct\npossibility—it could potentially strike targets as distant as 300\nkilometers from the Lebanese coast.\n\nSyrian military forces are optimized and deployed for war with Israel,\nso it would have only a limited ability to directly assist Iran in a\nconflict with the United States. Syria’s missile systems could target\nmilitary sites, logistics facilities and airfields in Israel. Syria’s\nYakhont coastal defense cruise missile system gives it an enhanced\ncapability to threaten naval and merchant vessels in the eastern\nMediterranean.\n\nHamas is also part of this threat environment, although its offensive\nand defensive capabilities are much more limited than Hizballah’s.\nHamas’s offensive capabilities rest on mortars and rockets of\ngradually increasing range, bringing more of central and southern\nIsrael under threat with every upgrade. Hamas can now reach central\nTel Aviv and beyond Beersheba in southern Israel.\n\nIran will likely supplement this proxy war by exploiting “images of\nvictory’—such as sinking a U.S. naval unit or displaying U.S.\ncasualties and prisoners to undermine support for the U.S. action and\nbolster its own supporters.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018112",
