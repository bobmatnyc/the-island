  "text": "70 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\n\nA. THE CVRA’S PURPOSES\n\nAn analysis of the CVRA’s application before prosecutors have filed\ncharges must begin by assessing the CVRA’s purposes because any\ninterpretation of the CVRA that is divorced from the statute’s purposes\nwould run the risk of defeating the statute’s aims. It is axiomatic that courts\nshould “give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in the light\nof the evident legislative purpose in enacting the law in question.”\n\nAs discussed above,’ one important goal of the CVRA was to keep\ncrime victims informed about any developments in the criminal justice\nprocess. But the need to be informed does not begin with the filing of a\nformal criminal charge. A crime victim needs to know what is happening\nbefore formal charging—during a criminal investigation, for example—just\nas much as she needs to know what is happening in court. Indeed, she may\nhave a greater need to know, as she may be concerned that the criminal who\nharmed her is still on the loose, posing a danger to her.\n\nSimilarly, concerning the second purpose—facilitating victim\nparticipation’!—without a right to pre-charging involvement, victims may\nbe effectively shut out of the process entirely. The Epstein case provides a\nuseful illustration of why the CVRA must be understood to extend rights to\nvictims prior to indictment. The prosecutors handling the investigation\nreached an agreement with Epstein that barred federal prosecution of sex\noffenses committed against dozens of victims, including Jane Doe Number\nOne and Jane Doe Number Two. If CVRA rights did not extend to the\nnegotiations surrounding the agreement, then the victims never would have\nhad any ability to participate in the resolution of the case.>”\n\nA construction of the CVRA that extends rights to victims before\ncharges are filed would be entirely consistent with the CVRA’s\nparticipatory purpose. If victims have the ability to participate in a pre-\ncharging plea bargaining process, for example, victims can help ensure that\nprosecutors do not overlook anything that should be covered in the plea\ndeal. For example, victims might be able to obtain agreement to a “no\ncontact” order or valuable restitution—points that the prosecutor might fail\n\n49 Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 130 S.\nCt. 1396, 1409 (2010) (quoting United States v. Bornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 310 (1976))\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n%° See supra notes 24-27.\n\n>! See supra notes 28-29.\n\n>? Even the Justice Department seems to recognize this point. As a matter of policy, the\nDepartment extends to victims the right to confer with prosecutors in situations where plea\ndiscussions occur before charges have been brought.
