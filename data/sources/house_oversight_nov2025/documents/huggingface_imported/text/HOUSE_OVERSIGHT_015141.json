  "text": "I' m ashamed of /ncreasing the military budget and decreasing the welfare\nbudget. |’ m ashamed of dropping cluster bombs and continuing to plant\nland mines.\n\nBut the Republicans didn’ t dare attack me for any of those\npositions because they are their positions too.\n\nI’ Il tell you how | survived this past year, how | maintained such\nhigh approval ratings, while Newt Gingrich fell by the wayside. How |\nmanaged, in short, to remain president. It was partly the state of the\neconomy, and it was partly the state of the culture. Pornography is a\ntwenty-billion-dollars-a-year business in this country. Steven Spielberg\ntold me that’ s more than Hollywood’ s entire domestic box-office\nreceipts. Because it’ s what the American public wants. And the TV\nnetworks exploit that dirty little secret. It' s why sweeps weeks are always\nso raunchy. So, then, what /did wasn’ t considered such a big deal after\nall.\n\nMainly, though, | have survived because, one sunny afternoon,\nMonica was positioning herself on the carpet under my desk in the Oval\nOffice while | was on the phone with Benjamin Netanyahu. | was telling\nhim about the time that Monica was performing oral sex on me while\n\nYassir Arafat was waiting in the Rose Garden for our appointment. |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015141",
