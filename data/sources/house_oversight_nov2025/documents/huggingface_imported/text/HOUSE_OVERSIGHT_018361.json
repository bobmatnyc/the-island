  "text": "(Yes.) Do you write it in English? (To be determined!) Working with composer Brian\nEno on the sound of the clock chime, and with a team of geologists and physicists,\nHillis had made the clock into a natural extension of his tinkertoy computer, a device\nthat both served a purpose and sent a message. If there was an emotion it conveyed,\na feeling that it tickled in the way Bernini’s Apollo and Daphne might inspire terror\nor joy or faith, it was meant to be awe.\n\nStewart Brand, one of the supporters of the clock and an early member of the New\nCaste too, would tell you that the idea for the clock had emerged from a desire to\nemphasize, to physicalize in a way no one could forget, the importance of longer-\nterm thinking. We'd all arrived now, Brand and the other clock masters worried, ata\nmoment in history when no one had a view that extended much past their own lives\n— or sometimes past the next election, or year, or the next financial quarter. Our\nmodern “on to the next thing” economics and politics were eroding every slow,\npatient instinct. “Civilization is revving itself into a pathetically short attention\nspan,” one manifesto for the clock began. “What we propose is both a mechanism\nand a myth.”!7? With its steady 10,000 year ticking, the Clock of the Long Now was\nmeant to make us think in longer jumps. The human winding mechanism, for\ninstance: Generations of clock-winders had to share in the work, and they would be\nconnected in a long thread over the 10,000 years. A sacred priesthood of time.\nMoving slowly. As I spent time thinking, dreaming about the clock, I found myself\ntoo craving the solidity and patient isolation it promised. Who among us these days\ndoesn’t want a break from the instant nowness of our age?\n\nYet, the more | understood the clock, the more | realized something else was at\nwork. Stop fora moment to consider who was backing and building the device. It\nwas a cluster of people who had, as a common link, the fact that they had their hands\nhonestly sunk into the guts of the Internet. Hillis, after all, had been waving more\nthan that slim book of email addresses when he talked about the early days of the\nInternet. He was waving the credentials of a man who had been living in the virtual\ncyber neighborhood of Web connections from its very first days. He was as close toa\nnative of the connected, fiber optic, light-speed world as you could find.\n\nAll the names supporting the clock smelled similarly of burning electrons: Jeff Bezos\nhad built Amazon into a high-speed marketplace whose backbone was the Web\nitself. Another backer, Mitch Kapor, had cracked apart several centuries of slow\naccounting habits when he created Lotus 1-2-3, the first successful computer\nspreadsheet program in 1983, software that permitted you to see and change your\nwhole business one keystroke at a time. Kapor’s software helped move finance from\nquarter-by-quarter calculations to a really instant-by-instant sort of business - more\nor less the opposite of the “long time frame” the clock team was aiming to preserve.\nEsther Dyson was one of the earliest, best investors in network companies. This was\na collection of men and women unified by a genius for connected change, sure, but\nalso by a desire for ever faster clock speeds, ever speedier delivery, ever faster\n\n179 “Civilization is revving itself’: Stewart Brand, The Clock of the Long Now: Time\nand Responsibility.
