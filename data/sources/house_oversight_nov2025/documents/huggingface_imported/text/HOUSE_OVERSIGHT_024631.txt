GLOBAL CANNABIS CONSUMERS

= The United Nations recently estimated that more than 180 million people
obally between the ages of 15 and 64, or more than 4% of this age group,
consume cannabis annually.

oO

= Atleast 20 countries have implemented medical cannabis laws, including
Australia, Canada, Colombia and Germany; countries without such laws
include China, Japan, Russia and the United States.

# Although federally illegal in the United States, 46 states and the District of
Columbia have passed at least one law that permits the manufacture,
istribution, dispensing or possession of cannabis. While most of these laws
are medical cannabis laws, 8 states have enacted recreational laws.

(on

® Across all medical cannabis laws in the United States, cannabis is legally
recognized as a form of therapy or medicine for more than 50 qualifying
conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, anorexia, arthritis, cancer, chronic
pain, epileosy and post-traumatic stress disorder.

= California is poised to become the largest recreational cannabis market
in the world with the implementation of its recreational law in January
2018—a watershed moment for the industry.

= The illegal cannabis market in the United States is estimated to be more
than $45 billion annually. (We estimate that the 2017 U.S. state-legal
cannabis market was $8.0 billion.) If federal legalization occurs, we believe
that the legal market could be more than two times the size of the current
illegal market, ultimately exceeding $100 billion annually.

# The cannabis industry provides a broad range of investment opportunities
in both the public and private markets for sophisticated investors who are
willing to take significant risks.
