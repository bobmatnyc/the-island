  "text": "viewed as external causes. Forces\noperating on human bodies to produce\naction, in contrast, are viewed as\nreflective of purpose, driven not only by\nexternal causes but, more importantly,\nby abstract reasons such as goals,\naspirations, and destiny. The meaning-\nmaking proclivities of humans are so\nirrepressible that when external forces\noperate on human bodies to produce a\nsignificant impact on humankind, even\nthe causes of the actions of these human\nbodies tend to be regarded in terms of\nmore abstract purposes and reasons. The\nanthropomorphic description of\nhurricanes is a caSe in point.\n\nActions of objects have causes,\nwhereas actions of humans have reasons.\nInvisible forces that operate on humans\nbut that appear to operate independent of\nhuman agency have been the subject of\nreligious speculations for centuries.\nThese invisible forces include: internal\nneural and biological forces (e.g.,\nhomeostatic processes, autonomic\nactivity) that exert regulatory forces\nwhich are largely hidden from conscious\nexperience or control; strong emotions\nthat seem to arise apart from conscious\nhuman intention (e.g., rage, fear,\nempathy); phenomena such as dreams or\nhallucinations that seemingly operate\nindependent from the human will;\nmotivations, biases, inclinations,\npredilections (such as\nanthropomorphism, ambiguity\navoidance, preference for simple\nexplanations, etc.) whose presence is so\nuniversal that, like language, the\ncapacities for their development or\nexpression may have an evolutionary\nbasis; individual beliefs (such as the\nbelief that there is a reality outside our\nhead/we are not dreaming; the belief in\nhuman freedom; in values such as\nequality, etc), attitudes, preferences,\n\nPage |12\n\ngoals, or intentions; aggregated beliefs\nthat result in social norms, values,\nreligion, culture, and social movements;\nand codified forces such as decrees,\nrules, alliances, and laws.\n\nBefore the enlightenment of the\n18th century, many scholars believed\nthat thought was instantaneous and that\naction was governed by an indivisible\nmind separate from the body. Ifa\npalpable cause for a person’s behavior\ncould not be identified, the Divine or\nsome counterpart constituted a more\nagreeable explanatory construct than\ninvisible forces acting through\nscientifically specifiable mechanisms.\nUnparalleled advances in the sciences\nhave occurred since the dawn of the\nEnlightenment, including the\ndevelopment of scientific theories about\nmagnetism, gravity, quantum mechanics,\nand dark matter that depict invisible\nforces operating with measurable effects\non physical bodies. During this same\nperiod, serious scientific research on\ninvisible forces acting within, on and\nacross human bodies was slowed and\nunderfunded in part because the study of\nthe human mind and behavior was\nregarded by many in the public and in\npolitics as soft and of dubious validity.\nThe result is that many still regard the\nmind and behavior as best understood in\nterms of the actions of non-scientific\nagents, such as a god or gods, and the\nmanifestations of mental illness as the\nresult of a failure of individual will —a\ndenial of the possibility that invisible\nforces (that is, forces that are tractable\nscientifically but of which a person is\nnot normally aware) can affect mind and\nbehavior.\n\nOne could try to explain away\nthe gap in scientific knowledge about\ninvisible forces by referring to the\nconception of science and religion as\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021258",
