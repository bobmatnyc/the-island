  "text": "It was here, when he was 92 years old, that I first came to know him.\n2.\n\nBefore I moved to Beijing in 2002 a friend took me aside and offered this thought:\n“Your life in China will change the way you see the world. But if you want to get the\nmost out of it, you have to understand that as important as being bilingual is, it is as\nimportant to be bicultural.” I had not honestly thought of this as part of my plan, but\nit seemed like good advice. | have hewed to it as a personal law ever since. From my\nfirst days in China, | lived almost entirely among the Chinese. I can, for instance,\nnearly number on one hand the meals | shared with Westerners over my years\nthere. This advice to learn to be bicultural really did change my experience of living\nin China. It changed how! saw the world. It presented moments of really honest and\nsearching confusion. I had conversations where I understood every word and yet\nhad no idea what my interlocutor meant. I had periods where | did not know which\nculture was pulling on my mind. But the decision produced, at least, a fortunate\nencounter that led me to Master Nan’s school.\n\nSeveral years after I arrived in Beijing, I was out for dinner one evening with a close\nChinese friend. My friend is a remarkable woman. If you ask how China has gone\nfrom poverty to prosperity in record time, it is partly because of people like her. She\nhad studied in the Chinese educational system, had moved overseas and mastered\nthe technical arts of economics and finance, and had returned eagerly to help in the\nconstruction of modern post-reform China. Nearly any time the government had\nsome new and difficult financial problem to manage, she would be shuffled into the\nnervous hands of some baffled Minister or Vice Premier. She had, in her various\nactivities, helped put the Chinese stock exchange on its feet, rebuilt bankrupt banks,\nand had overseen the construction of China’s first sovereign wealth fund. Though\nonly a few years older than me, her unique skills and absolute loyalty meant she had\nseen much of the development of China’s speed-train economy - part miracle, part\nnear accident - from zero-distance range.\n\nAs she and I were finishing dinner that evening, a door opened to a private dining\nroom near us in the restaurant. Chinese often eat out in private rooms, and the best\nrestaurants are usually warrens of well-appointed secret spaces, a reminder that in\nChina door after door after door leads to ever more secure sanctums—think of the\nnested power architecture of the Forbidden City. When the door near us opened, a\nstream of senior Chinese party figures paraded past, hovering around an intense,\nsquare-jawed and smiling man who was soon to become one of the most powerful\nfigures in China. As this man walked past, he nodded hello to both of us. | asked my\nfriend once he had left: “How do you know him?” | expected her contact with senior\nleaders on financial matters would explain the connection. Her answer surprised\nme.\n\n“We both,” she said, “have the same Master.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018239",
