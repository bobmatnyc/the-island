This signals the emergence of new\naspirations and social changes for Saudis. While these developments will support\nimplementation of Saudi Vision 2030, they will pose threats to the existing business\nmodels of Saudi retailers such as Jarir and Extra that are currently substituting for the\nlack of entertainment opportunities in the country.\n\nOS Merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 63\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016173",
