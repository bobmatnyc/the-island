  "text": "strong sectors in Saudi Arabia, we will develop the economy, create jobs, improve government and fund\nrevenues and other benefits, and at the same time Aramco still in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\n* How much will you sell, what is the percentage?\n- There are two main factors to determine the percentage of the offering.\n* What will we sell? Is the service, wells, or what?\n\n- We sell the value of the company, while wells are owned by the state, only the company has the right\nto use these wells, which is in the past and still at the present and has not changed anymore. The size of\nthe quota to be sold is governed by to two factors, one is the demand, is there a demand or not. Second,\nwhat do we have on (Pay Plan) as investments in or outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There was a\nrequest, but we need the cash. Because we do not have a sector that invests in Saudi Arabia or absorbs\nthis investment, why do we sell a stake for Aramco, but if there is a request and find a sector that needs\nthis investment, the second day we will sell. This is the two factors that will determine how much we sell\nfrom Aramco, but undoubtedly will not be far from 5% too much.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023653",
