  "text": "Nonetheless, historical comments about what the classical thermodynamic term,\n\nentropy, is and is not about are in order.\n\nWe recall that Richard Feynmann, in his well-known 1962 class notes,\nLectures on Physics, said that the subject of thermodynamics is the study of\nrelationships among the heat, energetic and organizational properties of materials,\nwithout knowing their internal structure. Historically, the relational formalisms of\nequilibrium thermodynamics emerged before our knowledge of the internal structure\nof matter. For examples, the pressure in an insulated container of gas is due to\nmolecular bombardment of the container walls, which increases with heat or\ncompression of its volume. Compression of its volume increases its temperature\nand expansion of its volume leads to cooling. Note that these relationships hold\n\nwithout specifying the constituents and the specifics of a particular gas or solid.\n\nIn his lectures, Feynman’s intuitively accessible examples of reversible\nthermodynamic properties are reminiscent of his on camera performance at the\nSenatorial hearings about the Challenger disaster. Recall that he dropped an O-ring\nin a glass of iced water demonstrating cold-induced rigidification of the rubber ring,\nwhich he postulated to be the cause of the fuel leak and resulting explosion. In his\nLectures, he said that if one holds a rubber band between ones lips as a crude\nthermometer, stretching a rubber band heats up the lips and relaxing it cools them.\nWorking the same system in reverse, and equilibrium thermodynamic systems are\nclassically reversible, we find that heating a rubber band makes it contract. These\nchanges involve complicated alterations in the internal arrangements of the\npolymeric strands of rubber, their structural properties, the details of which, for the\npurpose of global thermodynamic characterization, need not be known. The\nrelationships between physical state, energy and temperature in this material were\npredictable from thermodynamic laws even without specific knowledge of the\n\ncomplex internal structure and physical dynamics of rubber.\n\nThermodynamic theory, which makes deep conceptual connections between\nquantitatively measurable primitives such as heat, hotness and work and the\n\ninvisible in the form of derived ideas such as energy and entropy, yielded an\n\n70\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013570",
