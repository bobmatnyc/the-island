  "text": "Y' know, Sarah, if we get elected, | was hoping that our little tryst in\nWashington could happen again, perhaps this time in the Oval Office.\n\nPALIN: Thanks but no thanks.\n\nMcCAIN: | remember you were so pregnant then.\n\nPALIN: And | remember exactly what you said. “Let me baptize your\nfetus with some maverick juice.” How romantic. But you were lucky | was\nalready pregnant, because it would not have happened otherwise, since, as\nyou know, I’ m against birth control. Raising children is performing a task\nthat is from God. And | believe that life begins before conception.\n\nMcCAIN: You and the Bush administration. They also consider birth\ncontrol to be a form of abortion. The Health and Human Services\nDepartment is secretly trying to redefine contraception--the Pill, IUDs, you\nname it—redefine as abortion. So this federal agency could eliminate\nmany state laws. Pharmacists could refuse to supply women with birth\ncontrol devices. Insurance companies wouldn’ t cover contraception. Rape\nvictims wouldn’ t have access to the morning-after pill. You have your\nbeliefs and | respect them, but I’ m trying to distance myself from George\nBush.\n\nPALIN: Except for his speechwriters.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015170",
