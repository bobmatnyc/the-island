  "text": "From a political and military standpoint, the\nTrump defense plan parallels the goals and\nobjectives of President Reagan’s military\npush. And with McCain’s more aggressive\nplan aligned on the same premise of\nmodernizing and improving the readiness\nof the US military, Trump will likely have the\nbacking of this influential member of the\nRepublican congressional leadership.\n\nToday's Economic Backdrop—\n\nSimilar to the 1960s\n\nThe economic and financial implications of\na large, multiyear defense-spending plan\nmust be weighed against the economic\nenvironment at the time of implementation.\nAnd from a historical context, today’s\nconditions have more similarities to the\neconomic setting of the mid- 1960s than\nduring the defense buildups of the early\n1980s or early 2000s, which were either\nin recession or the very early stages of\nrecovery.\n\nIn contrast, the US economy in the mid-\n1960s was already in its fifth year of\nexpansion, the jobless rate of 4.5% was\nrelatively low and inflation was tame\n(roughly 1.5%). Nonetheless, the extra\ndefense spending boosted domestic\ndemand growth and added significant\npressure to labor costs, materials and\nsupplies, and product prices. So much so\nthat the acceleration in consumer price\ninflation (from 1% in 1961 to near 6% in\n19°70) from the start to the end of that\nbusiness cycle was one of the largest of\nany economic growth cycle during the\npostwar period.\n\nToday’s economic backdrop looks similar in\nmany ways. The economy has been in\nrecovery for seven years, the jobless rate is\nin the mid-4% range and inflation is stable\n(at around 2%). While many domestic and\nglobal factors are different now, we would\nstill expect a large multiyear defense-\n\nspending program to add to growth and\nput upward pressure on labor costs and\ninflation in the coming years. Keep in mind\nthat we’re coming off the weakest five-year\ndefense spending trend in the past 50\nyears, so Trump’s defense spending need\nnot match any of the prior three to have a\nmajor impact.\n\nStay tuned for the unveiling of Trump’s\nbudget and pay close attention to the\ndefense spending request. A large\nmulti-year program would definitely lift\ninflationary pressures. While we wouldn't\nexpect an acceleration like that in the\n1960s, a sustained rise of 100 to 200\nbasis points in general inflation would still\nseem reasonable—and far above what the\nFederal Reserve and financial markets are\ncurrently expecting. =\n\nThe information contained herein reflects the views of AllianceBernstein L-P. or its affiliates and sources it believes are reliable as of the date of this publication.\nAllianceBernstein LP. makes no representations or warranties concerning the accuracy of any data.
