We willingly waive our privacy for corporations but not for\ngovernments.\n\nWhat the public might not fully realize, however, is that the gov-\nernment can access all the personal information in the databases of\nprivate companies if it issues a subpoena or search warrant, which it\ndoes often. As Snowden himself pointed out, “If Facebook is going\nto hand over all of your messages, all of your wall posts, all of your\nprivate photos, all of your private details from their server, the gov-\nernment has no need to intercept all of the communications that con-\nstitute those private records.” These Internet companies, even if they\nare only interested in exploiting the data for their own profit, cannot\nrefuse to share this information with the NSA, the FBI, and other\ngovernment agencies if they have a subpoena or search warrant.\n\nThat reality became evident to me in my investigation of the rape\ncharges brought (and subsequently dropped) against Dominique\nStrauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary\nFund, in 2011. Immediately after his arrest, Cyrus Vance Jr, the dis-\n\n© trict attorney of New York County, issued a subpoena for Strauss- ®\nKahn’s cell phone records, credit card records, hotel room electronic\nkey records, e-mails, room service bills, and the CCTV videos of his\nactivities (some of which I published in my article about the case\nin The New York Review of Books). Nor is this access uncommon.\nAccording to Vance in 2016, his office issues thousands of such sub-\npoenas every year. Even though Apple made headlines by refusing\nto comply with a court order to help the FBI unlock the iPhone of\na dead mass murderer in 2016, it had complied with many previous\nsubpoenas. In fact, in 2015 alone, it quietly provided the backed-up\ndata of some seventy-one hundred iPhone customers to government\nauthorities.\n\nIf anyone doubts the pervasiveness of government data collection,\nconsider a little-known government agency called the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau. Created in 2010 by Congress, it mines\ndata on a monthly basis from some 600 million personal credit card\naccounts, targeting about 95 percent of the credit card users in the\nUnited States. In addition, through eleven other data-mining pro-\ngrams, it gathers data on everything from private home mortgages\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 121 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019609",
