However, his\nsuggestion that the changes could be accompanied by partially offsetting cash transfers\nto poor households suggests policy-making caution. We do not think such a\nredistributive system could be technically put in place in a short time span.\nRecall that concurrently with the 2016 budget, a first round of energy subsidy reform\nsaw sweeping energy, water and electricity administered price changes being instituted\nin late December. We estimated the natural gas price hike on petrochemical firms,\ndomestic crude oil price hike as well as the combined gasoline and diesel price hike\nintroduced could add US$2.2bn, US$2.0bn and USS$3.8bn to central government\nrevenues if fully passed to the budget (a combined 1.2% of GDP). Impact of continued\nsimilar policies on domestic prices would be a further 1.5-2ppt annual increase in\nheadline inflation, and a gradual squeeze to household incomes (where gasoline, water\nand electricity likely represented c.1.5%, c0.4% and 1.6% respectively of consumer\nspending basket prior to the late December 2015 administered price adjustments).\nTable 7: Administered energy price adjustments carried out in December 2015\nProduct Price prior to Dec 2015 Currentprice %change\nMethane (US$/mn BTU) 0.75 1.25 66.7\nEthane (US$/mn BTU) 0.75 1.75 133.3\nArab light (US$/bbl) 4.24 6.35 49.8\nArab Heavy (US$/bbl) 2.67 44 64.8\nDiesel (US$/bbl) 9.8 14-19. 68.5\nHeavy Fuel Oil (HFO) 380cst 2.08 3.8 82.7\nHeavy Fuel Oil (HFO) 180cst 2.08 4.25 104.3\nPropane (USD/metric ton) - - -\nNaphtha (USD/metric ton) - - -\nButane (USD/metric ton) : -\nNatural gasoline (USD/metric ton) - -\nKerosene (US$/bbl) 25.7\n95 octane gasoline (SARIItr) 0.6 0.9 50.0\n91 octane gasoline (SARIItr) 0.45 0.75 66.7\nSource: SPA, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.
