  "text": "Chapter Seven\n\nIf you’d visited Tel Aviv in July 1967, you would have sensed a new spirit\nof confidence, not cockiness exactly, but a sort of spring in the collective step.\nThis was not just due to the Six-Day War. It was because the city, if not yet the\nrest of the country, had shed the economic austerity of Israel’s first two decades\nand was beginning to experience at least some of the consumer comforts which\nWestern Europe, or America, took for granted. But we were still a decade away\nfrom the first shopping malls, or the upscale cafés and restaurants which\nnowadays give places like Dizengoff Street, a few blocks back from the\nseafront, the feel of London or Paris on a summer’s day. Television had been\nintroduced only a year before the war. Color TV was still nearly a decade away.\nI can’t say I was surprised to learn, when the archives were opened a few years\nago, that a committee of moral arbiters in our Ministry of Education vetoed\nplans for the Beatles to perform in the city. “No intrinsic artistic value,” they\npronounced. “And their concerts provoke mass hysteria.”\n\nEven in Tel Aviv, and certainly the rest of Israel, a kind of cultural austerity\nstill prevailed, an emphasis on modesty and self-restraint. It was a legacy of\n1948, a reflection of the years of shared sacrifice, physical labor, and the life-\nand-death struggles which I, like most Israelis at the time, had experienced\nwithin our own lifetimes. That may help explain why I can remember no one\nremarking on an aspect of my character which, once I rose to public\nprominence, would attract attention, frequent comment, and sometimes\ncriticism as well: the fact that I seemed so se/f-contained, reluctant to engage\nemotionally with people beyond a circle of close friends or confidants. My lack\nof smalltalk, and the kind of gladhanding and schmoozing that are the currency\nof political life. At the time of the 1967 war, I was not yet a public figure. Yet to\nthe extent those around me would have taken note — family, university\nclassmates, sayeret comrades, or officers in the Airya — my slight emotional\naloofness, my focus on simply getting things done, and the way I internalized\nsetbacks, even tragedies like the death of Nechemia Cohen, was not exceptional.\nIt was, in many ways, simply Israeli.\n\nYet as Israel, Israeli society and my place in them changed, it would be\nsuggested to me more than once — not always kindly, when it was from critics or\nrivals — that I had a “touch of Aspbergers” in me, a reference to those on the\nmore benign reaches of the autism spectrum with a special facility for math,\n\n98\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011569",
