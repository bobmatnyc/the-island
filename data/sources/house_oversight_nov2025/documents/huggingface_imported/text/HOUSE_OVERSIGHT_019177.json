It’s like, I introduced him to\n\ngoes on and on, like that.\n\nbeing fourteen or fifteen at the\nfourteen when this happened —\nof all these?\n\nmean?\n\nem.\n\nw anybody’s real true age? Or he\n\nle told me the younger the better.\n\ntter. All right.\now it worked. He didnt—let me\n\nto bring him a woman who was\n\nreally like it.\n\ngo for it. He just didn’t care for it.\nit [are] between the ages of, like,\n\nit some of them,\n\n60\n\nI think, lie about —\n\nen I started off young, | think he —\nsve me. I think he knew that 1 was ©\n\neet eee\n\nFittuy Ricu\n\nyounger — like, seventeen— but I told him I was, like, eigh-\nteen. Most of those girls lie when they go in there.\n\nRECAREY: Let’s talk about [Mary] for a minute.\n\nDOBBS: Okay.\n\nRECAREY: [Mary] at the time was dating your cousin, right?\n\nDOBBS: Mm-hmm.\n\nRECAREY: Okay. She told you she needed to make money. Did\nshe know you worked for Jeffrey? '\n\nDOBBS: I told her.\n\nRECAREY: You had told her you worked for Jeffrey.\n\nDOBBS: Mm-hmm.\n\nRECAREY: Did you tell her what it entailed? So she knew that?\n\nDOBBS: She knew everything before she even agreed to it.\n\nRECAREY: Okay. So she knew that there was going to have to be\nsome kind of —\n\nDOBBS: Contact. Pretty much. Yeah. I told her. I told her exactly\nwhat his expectations were. I told her what goes on with the\ngirls that go up there. I told her—it was like, “It’s your call.”\nI was like, “If you want to do this, fine. If not, fine. But when\nyou go in that room, I don’t want to hear you say, ‘Oh, I didn't\nknow he was going to do all that’ Because I’m telling you\nright now, he’s expecting it.”\n\nRECAREY: Basically, this is touching —\n\nDOBBS: Fondling —\n\n| RECAREY: Fondling—\n. DOBBS: Or whatever. And I told her when she went on her own.\n\nJust like, “Just remember, the more you do, the more you\nmake. But that’s—that’s up to you.” And she asked me, and I\nbrought up, told her I wouldn't do more.\n\n61\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019177",
