  "text": "The answer to the many questions that still swirl around Epstein and his high-\nplaced friends are the subject of roughly a half-dozen lawsuits that are still\npending in both Palm Beach County and New York. Some of the nation’s top\nattorneys have represented Epstein and some of his victims.\n\nBut like many of the past lawsuits spawned by Epstein’s behavior, most of the\nremaining ones are expected to be settled. And even public court records don't\ntell the full story — because many documents have been sealed or are heavily\nredacted.\n\nFor example, a defamation lawsuit against one of Epstein’s close friends was\nscheduled to go to trial in U.S. District Court in New York this coming Monday.\nBut both sides agreed to a delay last week, often a signal that a settlement\ncould be in the works.\n\nThe suit was filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre against British-born socialite and\nlongtime Epstein friend Ghislaine Maxwell. In a 2009 lawsuit that Epstein\nsettled for an undisclosed amount, Giuffre claimed she was 15 when Maxwell\nrecruited her from her $9-an-hour job in the locker room at Mar-a-Lago, where\nher father had a job as a maintenance worker. Giuffre claims in court records\nthat Maxwell introduced her to Epstein and that Epstein turned her into his\ninternational sex slave.\n\nMaxwell wasn’t sued as part of the lawsuit Giuffre filed against Epstein. But, in\ncourt papers filed by Giuffre, Maxwell was accused of grooming Giuffre to be\nEpstein’s sexual toy.\n\nMaxwell ignored the allegations until Giuffre raised them again in December\n2014 and Maxwell began publicly disputing Giuffe’s claims. Famed attorney\nDavid Boies then filed a defamation lawsuit on Giuffre’s behalf, claiming\nMaxwell “undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to discredit Giuffre.”\nIn media interviews, Maxwell called Giuffre’s claims “obvious lies,” Boies wrote.\n\nThe trial promised to provide scurrilous details about Giuffre’s widely publicized\ncontention in court records that Epstein not only used her but loaned her to his\nrich and powerful friends, including such notables as Prince Andrew and\nformer President Bill Clinton. Similar claims against nationally-known attorney\nAlan Dershowitz, who represents Epstein, were withdrawn when the Harvard\nlaw professor and Giuffre’s attorneys reached a confidential settlement in\ndueling defamation lawsuits they filed against each other over the allegations.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022992",
