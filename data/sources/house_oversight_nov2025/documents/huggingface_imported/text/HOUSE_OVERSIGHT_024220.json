  "text": "Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL\n\n6. Interest Rate Risk —-A Common Misperception\n\nWe find a common misperception among investors to be the degree of interest rate risk in the global utility\nsector, as interest rate sensitivity has declined steadily since the modern utility industry came into being in\nthe early 1990s.\n\nThere is a relatively higher degree of interest rate risk in the defensive, fully-regulated utilities given their\nbond-like returns and the capital-intensive nature of the industry, which demands heavy use of debt financing.\nSuch defensive fully-regulated utilities can be found in all regions, however the highest concentration is found\nin the US. European, Asian and Latam utilities are more levered to economic growth and therefore tend to be\nno more interest rate-sensitive than broad market equities.\n\nEven the performance of the more interest rate-sensitive US utilities is not fully determined by interest rates.\nFor example, during the market rally from fall 2002 to summer 2007, the US utility sector generated a non-\nbeta-adjusted annualized total return 5.2% higher (2.8% from better price appreciation and 2.4% from\ndividend reinvestment) than the S&P 500, while the 10-year Treasury yield rose from 3.6% to 4.9% (+130 bps)\nover this period. Valuation re-rating and earnings growth from generators, as economic growth tightened\npower markets and raised commodity prices, outweighed the negative impact of rising interest rates.\n\nWe would note furthermore that yield relationships have moved to unprecedented extremes such that, for\nexample, the dividend yield for US regulated utilities versus the 10-year Treasury yield currently sits at 7\nstandard deviations above the mean from the historical pre-2008 environment (see graph below). An even\nmore dramatic relationship exists for the European utilities. This suggests that policy rates are at such levels\nthat there is substantial cushion against rising rates.\n\nUS utilities/US 10-yr Treasury Ratio\n\nBBUTY fedex. / USGGIOVE Index 2.3012. «28\n\nFinally, we track interest rate risk in the Electron risk model for all positions. We are not looking to make\nmacro calls, and the portfolio’s net interest rate risk is kept within acceptable limits as we select stocks in the\nglobal utility sector. This process has worked well for us as over 7 years we have posted strong returns and\nalpha generation in both rising and falling interest rate environments. As a result, many investors are\npleasantly surprised to learn that despite perceptions of the global utility sector’s interest rate sensitivity,\nElectron’s return correlation to interest rates is slightly lower than the HFRI Equity Hedge Index’s return\ncorrelation to interest rates.\n\n19 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024220",
