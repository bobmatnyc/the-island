His legal\ninterpretation of proper executive branch function too often thwarted his\nboss's wishes.\n\nDowd and his colleagues, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow—the trio of law-\nyers charged with navigating the president through his personal legal\nproblems—had, on the other hand, become highly skilled in avoiding\ntheir client's bad humor, which was often accompanied by menacing,\nbarely controlled personal attacks. All three men understood that to be a\nsuccessful lawyer for Donald Trump was to tell the client what he wanted\nto hear.\n\nTrump harbored a myth about the ideal lawyer that had almost noth-\ning to do with the practice of law. He invariably cited Roy Cohn, his old\nNew York friend, attorney, and tough-guy mentor, and Robert Kennedy,\nJohn F. Kennedy’s brother. “He was always on my ass about Roy Cohn\nand Bobby Kennedy,” said Steve Bannon, the political strategist who,\nperhaps more than anyone else, was responsible for Trump's victory.\n“Roy Cohn and Bobby Kennedy, he would say. ‘Where’s my Roy Cohn\nand Bobby Kennedy?’” Cohn, to his own benefit and legend, built the\nmyth that Trump continued to embrace: with enough juice and mus-\ncle, the legal system could always be gamed. Bobby Kennedy had been\nhis brother’s attorney general and hatchet man; he protected JFK and\nworked the back channels of power for the benefit of the family.\n\nThis was the constant Trump theme: beating the system. “I’m the guy\nwho gets away with it,” he had often bragged to friends in New York.\n\nAt the same time, he did not want to know details. He merely wanted\nhis lawyers to assure him that he was winning. “We're killing it, right?\nThat's what I want to know. That's all I want to know. If we're not killing\nit, you screwed up,’ he shouted one afternoon at members of his ad hoc\nlegal staff.\n\nFrom the start, it had become a particular challenge to find top law-\nyers to take on what, in the past, had always been one of the most vaunted\nof legal assignments: representing the president of the United States. One\nhigh-profile Washington white-collar litigator gave Trump a list of twenty\n\nSIEGE\n\nissues that would immediately need to be addressed if he were to ta\non the case. Trump refused to consider any of them. More than a doz\nmajor firms had turned down his business. In the end, Trump was left wi\na ragtag group of solo practitioners without the heft and resources of t\nfirms. Now, thirteen months after his inauguration, he was facing px\nsonal legal trouble at least as great as that faced by Richard Nixon and E\nClinton, and doing so with what seemed like, at best, a Court Street les\nteam. But Trump appeared to be oblivious to this exposed flank. Ratch:\ning up his level of denial about the legal threats around him, he breez\nrationalized: “If I had good lawyers, I'd look guilty.”\n\nDowd, at seventy-seven, had had a long, successful legal career, be\nin government and in Washington law firms. But that was in the past. ]\nwas on his own now, eager to postpone retirement. He knew the imp«\ntance, certainly to his own position in Trump's legal circle, of und\nstanding his client’s needs. He was forced to agree with the presider\nassessment of the investigation into his campaign’s contact with Russi\nstate interests: it would not reach him. To that end, Dowd, and the otk\nmembers of Trump's legal team, recommended that the president coa\nerate with the Mueller investigation.\n\n“Tm not a target, right?” Trump constantly prodded them.\n\nThis wasn’t a rhetorical question. He insisted on an answer, and\naffirmative one: “Mr. President, you're not a target.” Early in his tenu\nTrump had pushed FBI director James Comey to provide precisely tl\nreassurance. In one of the signature moves of his presidency, he had fir\nComey in May 2017 in part because he wasn't satisfied with the enth\nsiasm of the affirmation and therefore assumed Comey was plotti\nagainst him.\n\nWhether the president was indeed a target—and it would surely ha\ntaken a through-the-looking-glass exercise not to see him as the bullse\nof the Mueller investigation—seemed to occupy a separate reality fr\nTrump’s need to be reassured that he was not a target.\n\n“Trump's trained me,’ Ty Cobb told Steve Bannon. “Even if it’s bz\nit’s great.”\n\nTrump imagined—indeed, with a preternatural confidence, nothi\nappeared to dissuade him—that sometime in the very near future he wot\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021125",
