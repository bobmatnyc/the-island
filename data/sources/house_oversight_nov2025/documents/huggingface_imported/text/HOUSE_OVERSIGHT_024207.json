However, it is very interesting to note that an inflection point\nappears to have occurred in the middle of 2012, with hedge funds increasing their net exposure to\nthe global utility sector after a long period of reducing net. The long/short ratio of utility stocks held\nby hedge funds fell from 3.0x in Jan 08 to about 1.7x in Jan 12 (4 years), but has since risen by 60% to\n2.7x, which is more than twice the increase for hedge funds’ overall net exposure during the same\nperiod (source: Goldman Sachs).\n\nBased on discussions with the Street, it appears that this short exposure has been expressed via ETFs,\nregional utility indices or large bellwether index utility proxies. Individual name crowdedness has\ncontinued to remain at a low level (e.g., utilities rarely show up Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP list —\nticker GSTHHVIP). Today, utilities account for the lowest in gross assets held of the 10 global\nsectors. (Source: Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund Trend Monitor analysis of 700 hedge funds with $1.3\ntrillion in gross assets.)\n\nIn addition, global QE programs have boosted demand for higher-beta stocks, which has contributed\nto the recent relative underperformance of and lack of interest in utilities. However (see below), the\nunderperformance of US _ utilities has diminished with each successive QE round (QE1\n\n6 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024207",
