  "text": "Alex Flachsbart gives a presentation on opportunity zones in Athens, Alabama.\nPhotographer: Nicole Craine/Bloomberg\n\nWhen he read about opportunity zones in a 2017 draft of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, his\nmind reeled. Here was an uncapped subsidy far more flexible than anything he’d used\nbefore. It could draw investment for an array of projects. He imagined funding startups in\nHuntsville, where NASA’s presence has lured a deep bench of talented engineers, and the\nrenovation of an old civic complex in Mobile.\n\nFlachsbart’s nonprofit—which has board members from the state’s largest utility and its\nbiggest bank, Regions Financial Corp.—is now in talks for 10 potential projects that need\nmore than $100 million in equity investment, he said. None have been funded yet, but he’s\ncertain some will be. Meanwhile, he keeps driving.\n\nBaltimore Billionaire\n\nOne of the arguments over opportunity zones is whether the U.S. is handing wealthy\ninvestors and companies big breaks on projects they would’ve done anyway. One example:\nHedge fund executive and former White House spokesman Anthony Scaramucci plans to\nbuild a “swank, boutique hotel” in Oakland. The paperwork for the permit was filed\nmonths before the neighborhood was designated an opportunity zone.\n\nBut that project pales in comparison to what’s happening in Baltimore. More than a year\nbefore President Donald Trump signed the law, real estate developer Steven Siegel helped\nnegotiate one of the largest public financing deals of its kind for a client, a company owned\nby billionaire Kevin Plank, founder of athletic-wear maker Under Armour Inc.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016416",
