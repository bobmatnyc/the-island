  "text": "220 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics\n\nrole), is the lack of any clear formulation of what \"justice\" means. This section explores this\nissue, via detailed consideration of the “Golden Rule” folk maxim do unto others as you\nwould have them do unto you — a classical formulation of the notion of fairness and justices\n— to AGI ethics. Taking the Golden Rule as a starting-point, we will elaborate five ethical\nimperatives that incorporate aspects of the notion of ethical synergy discussed above. Simple as\nit may seem, the Golden Rule actually elicits a variety of deep issues regarding the relationship\nbetween ethics, experience and learning. When seriously analyzed, it results in a multifactorial\nelaboration, involving the combination of various factors related to the basic Golden Rule idea.\nWhich brings us back in the end to the potential value of methods like CEV, CAV or CBV for\nunderstanding how human ethics balances the multiple factors. Our goal here is not to present\nany kind of definitive analysis of the ethics of justice, but just to briefly and roughly indicate\na number of the relevant significant issues — things that anyone designing or teaching an AGI\nwould do well to keep in mind.\n\nThe trickiest aspect of the Golden Rule, as has been frequently observed, is achieving the\nright level of abstraction. Taken too literally, the Golden Rule would suggest, for instance, that\na parent should not wipe a child’s soiled bottom because the parent does not want the child to\nwipe the parent’s soiled bottom. But if the parent interprets the Golden Rule more intelligently\nand abstractly, the parent may conclude that they should wipe the child’s bottom after all:\nthey should “wipe the child’s bottom when the child can’t do it themselves”, consistently with\nbelieving that the child should “wipe the parent’s bottom when the parent can’t do it themselves”\n(which may well happen eventually should the parent develop incontinence in old age).\n\nThis line of thinking leads to Kant’s Categorical Imperative [Kan64] which (in one inter-\npretation) states essentially that one should “Act only according to that maxim whereby you\ncan at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\" The Categorical Imperative\nadds precision to the Golden Rule, but also removes the practicality of the latter. Formaliz-\ning the “implicit universal law” underlying an everyday action is a huge problem, falling prey\nto the same issue that has kept us from adequately formalizing the rules of natural language\ngrammar, or formalizing common-sense knowledge about everyday object like cups, bowls and\ngrass (substantial effort notwithstanding, e.g. Cyc in the commonsense knowledge case, and the\nwhole discipline of modern linguistics in the NL case). There is no way to apply the Categorical\nImperative, as literally stated, in everyday life.\n\nFurthermore, if one wishes to teach ethics as well as to practice it, the Categorical Imper-\native actually has a significant disadvantage compared to some other possible formulations of\nthe Golden Rule. The problem is that, if one follows the Categorical Imperative, one’s fellow\nmembers of society may well never understand the principles under which one is acting. Each\nof us may internally formulate abstract principles in a different way, and these may be very\ndifficult to communicate, especially among individuals with different belief systems, different\ncognitive architectures, or different levels of intelligence. Thus, if one’s goal is not just to act\nethically, but to encourage others to act ethically by setting a good example, the Categorical\nImperative may not be useful at all, as others may be unable to solve the “inverse problem” of\nguessing your intended maxim from your observed behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, one wouldn’t want to universally restrict one’s behavioral maxims to\nthose that one’s fellow members of society can understand — in that case, one would have to act\nwith a two-year old or a dog according to principles that they could understand, which would\nclearly be unethical according to human common sense. (Every two-year-old, once they grow\nup, would be grateful to their parents for not following this sort of principle.)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013136",
