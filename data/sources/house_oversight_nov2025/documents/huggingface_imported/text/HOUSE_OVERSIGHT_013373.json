  "text": "beginning, Edwards diligently represented three victims of sexual assaults perpetrated by\nEpstein. As explained in detail below, each and every one of Edwards’s litigation decisions was\nerounded in proper litigation judgment about the need to pursue effective discovery against\nEpstein, particularly in the face of Epstein’s stonewalling tactics. Edwards’s successful\nrepresentation finally forced Epstein to settle and pay appropriate damages. Effective and proper\nrepresentation of child victims who have been repeatedly sexually assaulted cannot form the\nbasis of a separate, “satellite” lawsuit, and therefore Edwards is entitled to summary judgment on\nthese grounds as well.\n\nThe truth is the record is entirely devoid of any evidence to support Epstein’s claims and\nis completely and consistently corroborative of Edwards’s sworn assertion of innocence. Put\nsimply, Epstein has.made allegations that have no basis in fact. To the contrary, his lawsuit was\nmeiely a desperate measure by a serial pedophile to prevent being held accountable for\nrepeatedly sexually abusing minor females. Epstein’s ulterior motives in filing and prosecuting\nthis lawsuit are blatantly obvious. Epstein's behavior is another clear demonstration that he feels\nhe lives above the law and that because of his wealth he can manipulate the system and pay for\nlawyers to do his dirty work - even to the extent of having them assert baseless claims against\nothier members of the Florida Bar. Epstein’s Second Amended Complaint against Edwards is\nnothing short of a far-fetched fictional fairy-tale with absolutely no evidence whatsoever to\n— his preposterous claims. It was his last ditch effort to escape the public disclosure by\nEdwards and his clients of the nature, extent, and sordid details of his life as a serial child\n\nmolester. Edwards’s Motion for Summary Judgment should be granted without equivocation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013373",
