Results from an exploratory study of\nCBD (GWP42003) in schizophrenia were released in September 2015. The trial was a\nPhase lla 6 week, placebo-controlled exploratory trial in 88 patients with schizophrenia\nrefractory to first line anti-psychotic medications. To be enrolled, patients must have\nbeen treated for a minimum of four weeks on a first line anti-psychotic medication and\nstill have a PANSS total score in excess of 60. CBD was administered as adjunct therapy\nona background of antipsychotic medication. The trial did not have a primary endpoint,\nbut rather a number of exploratory endpoints.\n\nCBD consistently demonstrated superiority to placebo, suggesting that CBD may have\nsubstantial anti-psychotic effects. CBD produced statistically significant benefits\ncompared to placebo on the PANSS positive sub-scale (p=0.018), the Clinical Global\nImpression of Severity (p=0.04) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (p=0.02).\nThe proportion of responders (improvement in PANSS Total score > 20%) was higher on\nCBD than placebo (p=0.07), with an Odds Ratio of 2.65. Moreover, CBD trended superior\nto placebo (p=0.07) on sub-domains of the PANSS that were particularly relevant to\ncognition in people with schizophrenia. The Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms\nshowed a trend in favor of CBD, and reached statistical significance in patients taking\nCBD together with a leading first line anti-psychotic medication. The rest of the\nexploratory endpoints, many of which were other scales measuring functionality and\ncognition in schizophrenia patients, also trended in favor of CBD.\n\nEven in the context of schizophrenia, CBD produced a clean safety profile, with no\nserious adverse events and a balanced incidence of adverse events compared to\nplacebo. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (9.3% CBD vs. 4.4% placebo),\nnausea (7% CBD vs. 0% placebo), headache (7% CBD vs. 8.9% placebo) and somnolence\n(0% CBD vs. 6.7% placebo). There were two withdrawals from the study due to\ntreatment-related adverse events, one each for CBD and placebo.\n\nCBD's activity in schizophrenia is supported by pre-clinical data in animal models, as well\nas by a recent study published in The Journal of Clinical investigations (2012) which\nsuggested CBD may be useful as either monotherapy or in combination with first line\nanti-psychotic agents. Nonetheless, while the p-values suggest that CBD has activity, its\npotency is difficult to judge without knowing the effect sizes. Therefore, additional data\nfrom this and subsequent studies will be necessary to fully understand the potential of\nCBD in schizophrenia. GW Pharma has indicated that it intends to pursue CBD's future\ndevelopment in pediatric orphan neuropsychiatric indications.\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024908",
