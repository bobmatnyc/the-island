Can you set up Google Chrome and use Incognito Mode?

If you search while signed into your Google account is impacts things, but using Incognito mode will resolve
that.

Chrome here https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/

Once installed...

Open an incognito window

3.

Eo

Click the Chrome menu |__| on the browser toolbar.

Select New incognito window.

A new window will open with the incognito icon in the corner.

You can also use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS) and ¢€-Shift-N (Mac) to open

an incognito window.

Mr. Epstein,

We currently have two negatives on first page in Google but one is at 6th and the other at 7th. (Universal
search, no history applied). Results will be very different if that PC has been used to click or search any of the
results and has not been cleared.

How did you pull the results you just sent?

Using Google Chrome + InCognito Mode + Clearing Browser Cache = only reliable reporting. I can help set
you up with this. Screenshot here of results using above method - http://.imgur.com/tfGN3Zj.png. This is the
true representation of what your average searcher will find (statistically, most searches will be from users
whom have not clicked on your negative articles before)

Much progress has been made since we spoke - premium placements are getting secured over next week,
hundreds of links have been built to your primary sites and the first movements are kicking in today (NY Mag
moved up to 4th a few hours ago). We still have confidence we are on the right track and doing everything we
can to get this cleaned up - another 45 days should be enough to have a clean first page based on what has
been done.
