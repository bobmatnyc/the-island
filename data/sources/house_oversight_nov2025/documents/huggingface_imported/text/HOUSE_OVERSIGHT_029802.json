Before 1990, moreover, no one\npredicted that Iraq, having just ended a\nbitter eight-year war with Iran, would\nswing its battered forces south to invade\nKuwait.\n\nSo if it's conventional wisdom that the\nUnited States will not, or should not,\nintervene militarily in the Middle East or\nSouth Asia after it draws down forces in\nIraq and Afghanistan, it's also likely dead\nwrong. What is true, however, is that\npolitical and military trajectories in the\nMiddle East and South Asia are likely to\nincreasingly challenge U.S. contingency\naccess in the coming decade. The ability\nfor the United States to surge large-scale\nforces into the region, as it did in the\n1990 and 2003 wars against Iraq, will\ngrow increasingly circumscribed. The\nUnited States will have to adapt to this\nnew strategic landscape by developing\nmore nimble, highly-mobile, stealthy, and\nnetworked forces, and by abandoning the\ntraditional practice of slowly and steadily\nbuilding up conventional forces at\nregional logistic hubs prior to launching\nwar.\n\n* Kk kK\n\nPerhaps the most significant factor that\nportends against further intervention in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029802",
