  "text": "e - Berlin: $1180 , including round-trip airfare from JFK and a one-\nweek stopover in London.\n\nHow do these numbers compare to your current domestic monthly expenses, including rent, car\ninsurance, utilities, weekend expenditures, partying, public transportation, gas, memberships,\nsubscriptions, food, and all the rest? Add it all up and you may well realize, like I did, that traveling\naround the world and having the time of your life can save you serious money.\n\nFear Factors: Overcoming Excuses\nNot to Travel\n\nTravelling is the ruin of all happiness! There’s no looking at a building here after seeing Italy.\n\n—FANNY BURNEY (1752-1840), English novelist\n\nBut I have a house and kids. I can’t travel!\n\nWhat about health insurance? What if something happens?\nIsn’t travel dangerous? What if I get kidnapped or mugged?\nBut I’m a woman—traveling alone would be dangerous.\n\nMax excuses not to travel are exactly that—excuses. I’ve been there, so this isn’t a holier-than-thou\n\nsermon. I know too well that it’s easier to live with ourselves if we cite an external reason for inaction.\n\nI’ve since met paraplegics and the deaf, senior citizens and single mothers, home owners and the poor,\nall of whom have sought and found excellent life-changing reasons for extended travel instead of\ndwelling on the million small reasons against it.\n\nMost of the concerns above are addressed in the Q&A, but one in particular requires a bit of\npreemptive nerve calming.\n\nIt’s 10:00 P.M. Do You Know Where Your Children Are?\nThe prime fear of all parents prior to their first international trip is somehow losing a child in the shuffle.\n\nThe good news is that if you are comfortable taking your kids to New York, San Francisco,\nWashington, D.C., or London, you will have even less to worry about in the starting cities I recommend\nin the Q&A. There are fewer guns and violent crimes in all of them compared to most large U.S. cities.\nThe likelihood of problems is decreased further when travel is less airport and hotel-hopping among\nstrangers and more relocation to a second home: a mini-retirement.\n\nBut still, what if?\n\nJen Errico, a single mother who took her two children on a five-month world tour, had a more acute\nfear than most, one that often woke her at 2:00 A.M. in a cold sweat: What if something happens to me?\n\nShe wanted to prime her kids for worst-case scenario but didn’t want to scare them to death, so—like\nall good mothers—she made it a game: Who can best memorize the itineraries, hotel addresses, and\nMom’s phone number? She had emergency contacts in each country whose numbers were loaded into\nthe speed dial of her cell phone, which had global roaming. In the end, nothing happened. Now she’s\nplanning to move to a ski chalet in Europe and send her kids to school in multilingual France. Success\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013961",
