  "text": "things like using Casio watches as timers.) No, the force at work was buried inside a\nnetwork of personal and technological ties, sometimes explicit, other times almost\nethereal in their nature until they were made real in a blast. By 2011 you could peel\nback some corner of the web and find sites like Al-Shumukh’s Special Explosives\nCourse for Beginners, where dark diagrams were uploaded, debated, refined and re-\ndrawn, like some sort of hobbyist site for car bomb geeks*!. Deeper still, encrypted\nchatrooms and messaging services pulsed invisibly, firing off real-time tips (use\naluminum not copper for detonation packs) and suggestions (Marines are easier to\ntarget in the morning). When soldiers said they were fighting a “terrorist network”\nthey really meant it: the force arrayed against them was a self-repairing, growing,\nconstantly-learning web.\n\nThe Pentagon had, after a few years of confronting this problem, organized a\ntaskforce to deal at least with the IEDs, the “Joint IED Device Defeat Organization”\n(JIEDDO).*2 The group specialized in miraculous engineering. They absolutely lived\nup to the can-do, American spirit sound of their name: Gee! Do! Scientists and\nwarfighters in JIEDDO devised ways to secretly surveil streets so they could fire on\nbomb-planting terrorists. They developed slick, blast-deflecting new designs for\ncars and pioneered armor that could absorb the hit of repeated surprise blasts. Gee!\nDo! was, its motto ran, trying to, “defeat the IED as a weapon of strategic influence.”\n\nThat made good sense, of course. It was a bit weird that $100 pipe-bombs were\ndisrupting America’s ten trillion dollar national interest. But: Defeating the device?\nYou could sense a limit in the way that mission statement was drawn out. It wasn’t\nenough. Beating the devices wasn’t the same as chewing apart the network that\nproduced them. That was the real target. The devices kept coming with their own\ninnovative, murderous rush, with the gotta-have-it new pressure we know as the\ndesire for the latest phone or video game or flat-screen TV. This raised an important\nquestion: Just what did it mean, really, to beat a network? Could you win? Could you\never get aheader? In fact this is a question that resonates in many parts of life now.\nThat feeling of constantly slipping behind, one that is tied to the heart of a connected\norder, a world where each additional link brings both a rich pipe of new data anda\nsense of what you might be missing or not quite understanding. To be aheader\nmarks, we will see, the nature of a real Seventh Sense. When you can fully feel the\nnetwork, understand its logic, then you can touch and use new sources of influence\nto reshape your business or your career or solve the problems in the world that\n\n41 By 2011: Stenersen as above\n\n42 The Pentagon had: On the establishement and background of JIEDDO: “The Joint\nImprovised Explosive Device Defeat Organization: DOD’s Fight Against IEDs Today\nand Tomorrow,” U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Armed Services,\nSubcomittee on Oversight & Investigations report November, 2008; “IEDs: the\nhome-made bombs that changed modern war,”, [JSS Strategic Comments Volume 18,\nIssue 5, 2012.
