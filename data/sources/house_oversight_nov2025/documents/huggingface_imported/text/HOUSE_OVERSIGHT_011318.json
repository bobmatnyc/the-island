Did you also go to the\nisland? My client says she met you there.\" We didn't get to\n\nask those questions, so we're in a situation now where that\nletter coming in would be highly prejudicial because the jury\n\nwill wonder, well, what does he have to say about this? And we\n\nhaven't been in a position to be able to do that.\n\nSo your Honor, for all those reasons we believe that\n\nMr. Freeh should b xcluded, the FOIA letter should not come\ninto evidence, and again, we believe that the issue of\n\nMr. Clinton should not be an issue relevant to this trial.\n\nNext, your Honor, they also seek to include\nstatements, hearsay statements and newspaper articles about\n\nPrince Andrew, and it's actually not his denial, as I\n\nunderstand it, Buckingham Palace's denial of the allegation of\n\nmy client. But again, Prince Andrew is not on the witness\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011318",
