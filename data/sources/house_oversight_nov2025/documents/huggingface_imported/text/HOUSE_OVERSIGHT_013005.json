An Urge is said to\ndevelop when a demand deviates from its target range: the urge then seeks to return the demand\nto its target range. For instance, in an animal-like agent the demand related to food is more\nclearly described as “fullness,” and there is a target range indicating that the agent is neither too\nhungry nor too full of food. If the agent’s fullness deviates from this range, an Urge to return\nthe demand to its target range arises. Similarly, if an agent’s novelty deviates from its target\nrange, this means the agent’s life has gotten either too boring or too disconcertingly weird, and\nthe agent gets an Urge for either more interesting activities (in the case of below-range novelty)\nor more familiar ones (in the case of above-range novelty).\n\nThere is also a primitive notion of Pleasure (and its opposite, displeasure), which is consid-\nered as different from the complex emotion of “happiness.” Pleasure is understood as associated\nwith Urges: pleasure occurs when an Urge is (at least partially) satisfied, whereas displeasure\noccurs when an urge gets increasingly severe. The degree to which an Urge is satisfied is not\nnecessarily defined instantaneously; it may be defined, for instance, as a time-decaying weighted\naverage of the proximity of the demand to its target range over the recent past.\n\nSo, for instance if an agent is bored and gets a lot of novel stimulation, then it experiences\nsome pleasure. If it’s bored and then the monotony of its stimulation gets even more extreme,\nthen it experiences some displeasure.\n\nNote that, according to this relatively simplistic approach, any decrease in the amount of\ndissatisfaction causes some pleasure; whereas if everything always continues within its accept-\nable range, there isn’t any pleasure. This may seem a little counterintuitive, but it’s important\nto understand that these simple definitions of “pleasure” and “displeasure” are not intended to\nfully capture the natural language concepts associated with those words. The natural language\nterms are used here simply as heuristics to convey the general character of the processes in-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013005",
