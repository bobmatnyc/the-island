  "text": "than ever before. Nor is this an accident-because despite Samuel\nHuntington's foreboding, what has occurred over recent generations is not a\nclash of civilizations but a fusion of civilizations.\n\nTo put it simply, the great world civilizations, which used to have detached\nand separate identities, now have increasingly overlapping areas of\ncommonality. Most people around the world now have the same aspirations\nas the Western middle classes: they want their children to get good\neducations, land good jobs, and live happy, productive lives as members of\nstable, peaceful communities. Instead of feeling depressed, the West should\nbe celebrating its phenomenal success at injecting the key elements of its\nworldview into other great civilizations.\n\nThe march of reason, triggered in the West by the Enlightenment, is\nspreading globally, leading to the emergence of pragmatic problem-solving\ncultures in every region and making it possible to envisage the emergence of\na stable and sustainable rules-based order. There is every reason to believe,\nmoreover, that the next few decades can be even better for humanity than\nthe last few-so long as the West does not lose confidence in its core values\nand retreat from global engagement. The greatest danger of the current\npessimism, therefore, is that it might become a self-fulfilling prophecy,\nleading to fear and withdrawal rather than attempts to reinvigorate the\nexisting global system.\n\nThe origins of the contemporary era lie in the West's transformation during\nthe Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. No\nother civilization can take credit for giving birth to modernity. This was not\ndone with some benign intent to uplift humanity in general; there were\nmany problems along the way, and the explosion of Western power across\nthe globe had some terrible consequences for other cultures and regions. Yet\nthe ultimate result was the diffusion of a modern outlook that relies on\nscience and rationality to solve problems, much to the ultimate benefit of\nthe planet's population.\n\nAs recently as half a century ago, for example, there was a global clash of\neconomic ideologies. Nikita Khrushchev, the former leader of the Soviet\nUnion, could claim that the state was better at delivering basic goods to\ncitizens than free markets were, but today such a view would be laughed at.\nThe market economy has made Chinese and Indian workers today far more\nproductive than they were under Mao Zedong or Jawaharlal Nehru, India's\nfirst prime minister. Societies now accept the simple fact that workers need\nmaterial incentives to be productive, which has led to increased dignity and\nself-worth. The vast majority of humanity is literate, is at least somewhat\nmobile, and has access to the world's store of existing knowledge. Around\nhalf of the adults in the world own a smartphone, and there are now more\nconnected mobile devices in total than there are people on the planet.\n\nThe spread of science and technology, meanwhile, has also improved human\ndignity and well-being. Most people used to experience lives that were nasty,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026841",
