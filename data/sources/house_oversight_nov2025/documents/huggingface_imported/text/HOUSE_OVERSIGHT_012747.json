Hauser\nViking/Penguin\nFor Jacques and Bert Hauser,\nmy parents,\nmy friends,\nand my reminder\nthat life should be\nlived to its fullest\nHauser Evilicious. Front matter 2\nPleasure is the greatest incentive to evil.\n⎯⎯ Plato\nTo witness suffering does one good, to inflict it even more so.\n⎯⎯ Friedrich Nietzsche\nMan produces evil as a bee produces honey.\n⎯⎯ William Golding\nHauser Evilicious. Front matter 3\nDear reader,\nHaving lived in Uganda and spoken with people who escaped from the savagery of the brutal\ndictators Milton Obote and Idi Amin, having heard stories of my father’s childhood as a Jew running\nthrough Nazi occupied France, and reading past and present-day accounts of genocide, I am familiar with\nthe horrors of evil. I have also been a student of human nature, trained as a scientist. These experiences\nhave propelled me to study the causes of evil, attempt to make some progress in explaining it to myself,\nand hopefully to you. There is a great urgency to understanding this problem. None of us can afford to\npassively watch millions of individuals lose their homes, children, and lives as a result of malice. Sloth is\na sin, especially when we live in a world where cultures of evil can so easily erupt.\nI am also familiar with and deeply moved by human kindness, our capacity to reach out and help\nstrangers. When my father was in a boarding school in the south of France, hiding from the Nazis, a little\ngirl approached him and asked if he was Jewish. My father, conditioned by his parents to deny his\nbackground, said no. The girl, sensing doubt, said “Well, if you are Jewish, you should know that the\ndirector of the school is handing Jewish children over to the Nazis.” My father promptly called his parents\nwho picked him up, moved him to another village and school, and survived to tell the story. This little girl\nexpressed one of our species’ signature capacities: the ability to show compassion for another person,\neven if their beliefs and desires are different.\nIn preparation for writing this book, I read transcripts and descriptions of thousands of horrific\nevents, listened to personal stories of survivors from financial ruin and war, worked with abused children\nwho were crucified by unfit parents, and watched both fictional films and documentaries that portrayed\npsychopaths, dictators of totalitarian regimes, and their hapless victims. As one often does in these\ncircumstances, I developed a tougher skin over time. But I have never lost track of the human travesties\nthat result from evil. As my father’s story suggests, I have also not lost sight of the fact that we are a\nspecies that has done great good, and will continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, to provide a sound\nand satisfying explanation of evil we must avoid falling into more romantic interpretations of the human\ncondition. Our best protection is science. This is the position I will defend.\nThe topic of evil is massive. This is, however, a short book, written without exhaustive\nreferences, in-depth descriptions of our atrocities, and comprehensive engagement with the many theories\non offer to explain evil. What I offer is my own explanation of evil, of how it evolved, how it develops\nwithin individuals, and how it affects the lives of millions of innocent victims. It is a minimalist\nexplanation of evil that is anchored in the sciences. I believe, as do many scientists, that deep\nunderstanding of exceptionally complicated phenomena requires staking out a piece of theoretical real\nestate with only a few properties, putting to the side many interesting, but potentially distracting details.\nThis book extracts the core of evil, the part that generates all the variation that our history has catalogued,\nand that our future holds.\nSincerely,\nHauser Evilicious.

Front matter 6\nPrologue:\nEvilution\n“There is no such thing as eradicating evil [because] the deepest essence of\nhuman nature consists of instinctual impulses which are of an elementary\nnature… and which aim at the satisfaction of certain primal needs.”\n-- Sigmund Freud\nI was drowning. This was not the first time. It was also not because I was a poor swimmer. I was 14\nyears old. A boy named Lionel James, who was the same age but twice my size, was shoving my head\nunder water, roaring with laughter as I struggled to gasp some air.\nI usually managed to avoid Lionel in the pool, but sometimes he got the best of me while I was\nplaying with friends. Lionel wasn’t the only one who bullied me in junior high school. He was part of an\nevil three pack, including Ronnie Paxton and Chris Joffe, each much larger and stronger than I. Almost\ndaily they locked me inside of the school’s lockers, bruised my arms by giving me knuckle-punches, and\ngave me purple-nurples by twisting my nipples. This was no fun for me. For James, Paxton, and Joffe it\nwas delicious enjoyment. Sometimes, while I was locked in my locker, my math teacher would let me\nout and then ask “Why do you get yourself into these situations?” Though I had great respect for my\nteacher’s math abilities, and actually had a crush on her, she was socially daft. Did she think I asked to be\npackaged up in the locker by my tormenters? It was sheer humiliation.\nOne day my mother noticed the bruises. Horrified, she asked what happened. I reluctantly told her\nthe story. She said we were going to talk with the principal. I told her I would prefer water drip torture.\nShe understood and we never went to see the principal.\nThe person who rescued me from my misery was my father, a man who had lived through the war\nas a child, running from village to village to escape the Nazis, and in so doing, confronted thuggish farm\nboys whose weight far exceeded their IQ. My father, upon hearing that I didn’t want to go to school\nanymore, offered a compromise: he would pick me up for lunch every day if I kept going to classes. I\nagreed, relishing the idea of escaping the lunch-time scene at school where James, Paxton and Joffe\npummeled me at will without getting caught.\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 7\nA month passed. I felt better. My father told me that it was time to go back to lunch at school, but\nwith a plan, one centered around the notion of respect. The only way to command it from my tormenters\nwas to fight back. “But Dad,” I said, “if I hit them, they will crush me.” “They might,” he said, “but you\nwill have gained some respect, and they may turn their attention to someone else.” It seemed like a\nremarkably stupid idea. But my father lived through a war and fought his way to respect among the thugs\nin every village school. I decided to give it a go.\nI went back to school. Soon thereafter, I found myself standing behind Paxton who displayed\nbiceps bigger than my head. I figured I had only one shot. I tapped him on the shoulder and swung as\nhard as I could, hitting him square in the chest. What aim. What perfection. What wasted energy. With no\nmore than a flinch, Paxton looked down at me, fury in his face, and grunted “What’s up with you?” With\ntears running and lips trembling, I sputtered “I can’t take it anymore. You, Joffe, and James are constantly\nhitting me and locking me in the lockers. I can’t take it!” And then, as if his entire brain had been rewired,\nserotonin surging to provide self-control, dopamine flowing to shift his sense of reward, the hulk spoke:\n“Really? Okay, we’ll stop.” And just like that, Paxton, Joffe and James stopped. No more locker games,\nno more bruises. They even saw me as a useful resource, someone who could help them pass some of\ntheir exams. From victim to victory.\nI was fortunate. Many are not. Thousands of children throughout the world are persecuted in a\nsimilar way but never fight back or if they do, are crushed for trying. Some are pushed so hard that they\ncommit suicide, tragedies that increasingly make headline news reports.\nThe fact that bullies often torment their victims for personal gain, cause great harm, and often\nenjoy the experience ⎯⎯ as did Lionel James ⎯⎯ fits well with a common view of evil. On this view, we\nthink of someone as evil if they inflict harm on innocent others, knowing that they are violating moral or\nlegal norms, and relishing the abuse delivered. But what of bullies who, due to immaturity or brain\ndeficits, simply don’t understand the scope of moral boundaries? What if they impose great harm on their\nvictims, but don’t enjoy the experience? What if the victims are not entirely innocent, such as those who\ndouble-time as bullies?\nWe can debate questions like these on philosophical grounds, attempting to refine what, precisely,\ncounts as an act of evildoing as opposed to some mere moral wrong, like breaking a promise or having an\naffair while married. Many have. I don’t believe, however, that this is how we will achieve our deepest\nunderstanding. Instead, I turn to the sciences of human nature, focusing on cases where people directly or\nindirectly cause excessive harm to innocent others as the essence of evil. To explain this form of evil, we\nmust dissect the underlying psychology, the brain circuits that generate this psychology, the genes that\nbuild brains, and the evolutionary history that has sculpted the genetic ensemble that makes us\ndistinctively human. This is the approach I pursue. If I’m right about this approach, not only will we gain\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 8\na deeper understanding of how and why our species has engaged in evildoing, but we will learn about our\nown individual vulnerability to follow suit. This prologue provides a sampling of the central ideas minus\nthe rich evidence and explanations that follow in the four core chapters of this book.\nA brief history of malice\nHomo sapiens, the knowing and wise animal, has logged an uncontested record of atrocities,\ndespite moral norms prohibiting such actions: no other species has abducted innocent children into rogue\narmies and then killed those who refused to kill, tossed infants into the air as targets for shooting practice,\ngang raped women to force them to carry the enemy’s fetus to term while destroying the souls of their\npowerless husbands, and mutilated and burned men to death because more humane forms of killing were\nless effective and enjoyable. These are horrific acts. They abound globally and across the ages. Many\nscholars have judged them as evil.\nDespite the pervasiveness of these atrocities, evil is commonly perceived as a defect, an\nunfortunate malignancy that has engulfed and metastasized within our species’ essential goodness. Evil is\nalso denied, relegated to mythology, the delusional imagination of a few madmen, the propaganda of\nimperialist nations, or the result of a rare mutation. Perhaps because of these impressions, we have an\nobsessive fascination with evil, evidenced by our fertile capacity to create and then consume films about\ngenocide, cunning rapists, master criminals, corporate raiders, psychopaths and serial killers. We are of\ntwo minds, wanting to hide from the atrocities of evil while feeding our insatiable appetite for more.\nTo understand evil is neither to justify nor excuse it, reflexively converting inhumane acts into\nmere accidents of our biology or the unfortunate consequences of bad environments. To understand evil is\nto open a door into its essence, to clarify its causes. In some cases, understanding may force us to\nexonerate the perpetrators, recognizing that they harbored significant brain damage and as a result, lacked\nself-control or awareness of others’ pain. In other cases, understanding will reveal that they knowingly\ncaused harm to innocent others, relishing the devastation left behind. By describing and understanding an\nindividual’s character with the tools of science, we are more likely to make appropriate assignments of\nresponsibility, blame, punishment, and future risk to society.\nTo understand evil requires facing our species’ sustained record of atrocities, laying out a variety\nof cases for inspection. Former Reverend Lawrence Murphy was responsible for over two hundred\ninstances of sexual abuse, luring innocent deaf children in with a saintly smile. Charles Manson, the\nillegitimate son of a sixteen year old woman and the self-proclaimed father of dozens of runaway women,\nwas responsible for the brutal death of five people by means of 114 knife jabs, while also prostituting his\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 9\nlovers, beating his wife, selling drugs, and stealing cars. Former Chairman of the NASDAQ stock\nexchange, Bernard Madoff, was responsible for initiating a Ponzi scheme involving money laundering,\nperjury, and mail fraud that caused thousands of people to suffer financial ruin. Jane Toppan, born\nHonora Kelley, was an American nurse who was responsible for killing over 30 patients by drug\noverdose, stating in her testimony that she experienced a sexual thrill when she held dying patients, and\nthat her goal in life was to kill more innocent people than anyone else in history. Former military\nspecialist Charles Granger was responsible for forcing nudity and sex among the Iraqi prisoners of Abu\nGhraib, putting individuals on dog leashes, depriving them of their senses with head bags, and piling\nnaked bodies into photographed still lifes, orchestrations that led to the ultimate humiliation and\ndehumanization of these prisoners.\nDepending upon how we think about the problem of evil, we might consider the individuals noted\nabove as minor evildoers or not evil at all because the harms were rather insignificant, because their goal\nwasn’t to directly harm anyone and then enjoy the trail of damage, or because they lacked the mental\ncapacity to assume responsibility for the atrocities committed. These individuals pale in comparison with\nthe most unambiguously radical evildoers of the 20-21 st century ⎯⎯ the dictators Idi Amin, Francisco\nFranco, Adolf Hitler, Kim Jong-il, Slobodan Milosevic, Pol Pot, Josef Stalin, Charles Taylor, and Mao\nZedong. These men were responsible for the brutal deaths of approximately 80 million people combined.\nMost were mentally healthy, at least in terms of clinical diagnoses. Many relished their atrocities. All\ndevised over-the-top means of ending lives. Whether by enticing or coercing their followers to torture,\ngang rape, and butcher human flesh, they went beyond what was necessary to get rid of unwanted others.\nThese are excessive harms, carried out with excessive techniques. In this book, I will not only explore\nthese extreme cases, but more mundane ones as well. Each case helps shape our understanding of what\npropells some individuals to cause harm on small or large scales, while others avoid it entirely, despite\ntemptations to the contrary.\nWhy and How?\nTo explain the landscape of human atrocities, from Reverend Lawrence Murphy to Mao Zedong, we need\nan account of why we evolved this capacity and how it works. I will explain both of these problems using\nthe theories and evidence of science.\nWhy? Evil evolved as an incidental consequence of our unique form of intelligence. All animals\nshow highly specialized abilities to solve problems linked to survival. Honey bees perform dances to tell\nothers about the precise location of nutritious pollen, providing an information highway that lowers the\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 10\ncosts of individual foraging challenges. Meerkats teach their young how to hunt dangerous but energyrich\nscorpion prey, providing an education that bypasses the risks of trial and error learning. Humans\nunconsciously wrinkle their noses and pull back their lips into an expression of disgust that communicates\ninformation about disease-ridden and toxic substances, thereby lowering the costs of sickness to others\nwho might be exposed. Each of these specializations involve exquisitely designed neural circuits and\nsensory machinery. Each specialization is used for one and only one problem ⎯⎯ except in humans.\nAnimal thoughts and emotions are like monogamous relationships, myopically and faithfully focused on a\nsingle problem for life. Human thoughts and emotions are like promiscuous relationships, broad-minded\nand liberated, free to couple as new problems surface.\nUnlike any other animal, the thoughts and emotions we use to solve problems in one domain can\nreadily be combined and recombined with thoughts and emotions from other domains. This is powerful,\nproviding great flexibility in addressing novel problems, some of which we create for ourselves. Disgust\nprovides an example. Disgust originally evolved as an adaptive response to detecting substances that are\ntoxic to our health, especially substances that are outside of the body but should be inside: feces, urine,\nblood, and vomit. Within the circulation of a promiscuous brain, however, disgust journeys to distant\nproblems, including the moral attitude of vegetarians toward meat eaters, our revulsion toward incest, and\nabhorrence of gratuitous torture. This journey involves the same brain mechanism that serves original\ndisgust, together with new connections that give voice to our moral sense. Promiscuity enables creativity.\nWhat the sciences reveal is that the capacity for promiscuous thinking was realized by\nevolutionary changes in the number of newly wired up brain areas. By increasing these connections, it\nwas possible, for the first time, to step outside the more narrow and specialized functions of each\nparticular brain area to solve a broader range of problems. Though we don’t know precisely when these\nchanges occurred, we know they occurred after our split from the other great apes ⎯⎯ the orangutans,\ngorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees. We know this from looking at both the brains of these species, as\nwell as the ways in which they use tools, communicate, cooperate, and attack each other. Not only are\nthere fewer connections between different regions of the brain, but their thinking in various domains is\nhighly monogamous, faithfully dedicated to specific adaptive problems.\nEmpowered by our new, massively connected and promiscuous brain, we alone migrated into and\ninhabited virtually every known environment on earth and some beyond, inventing abstract mathematical\nconcepts, conceiving grammatically structured languages, and creating glorious civilizations rich in\nrituals, laws, and beliefs in the supernatural. Our promiscuous brain also provided us with the engine for\nevil, but only as an incidental consequence of other adaptive capacities, including those that evolved to\nharm others for the purpose of surviving and reproducing.\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 11\nAll social animals fight to gain resources, using highly ritualized behaviors to assess their\nopponents and minimize the personal costs of injury. Changes in hormone levels and brain activity\nmotivate and reward the winners, and minimize the costs to the losers. In a small corner of the landscape\nof aggressive fighting styles are an elite group of killers, animals that go beyond harming their opponents\nto obliterating them: ants, wolves, lions, and chimpanzees. When these species attack to kill, they\ntypically target adult members of neighboring groups, using collaborative alliances to take out lone or\notherwise vulnerable victims. The rarity and limited scope of this form of lethal aggression is indicative\nof monogamous thinking, and tells us something important about the economics ⎯⎯ especially the costs\nand potential rewards of eliminating the enemy, as opposed to merely injuring them. Killing another adult\nis costly because it involves intense, prolonged combat with another individual who is fighting back. The\nrisks of significant personal injury are therefore high, even if the potential benefit is death to an opponent.\nAs the British anthropologist Richard Wrangham has suggested, animals can surmount these costs by\nattacking and killing only when there is a significant imbalance of power. This imbalance minimizes the\ncosts to the killers and maximizes the odds of a successful kill. Still, the rarity of killing reinforces an\nuncontested conclusion among biologists: all animals would rather fight and injure their opponents than\nfight and obliterate them, assuming that obliteration is costly to the attacker. In some cases, we are just\nlike these other animals ⎯⎯ killophobic.\nHistorical records, vividly summarized by Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman in his book On\nKilling, reveal that in some situations, soldiers avoid killing the enemy even though they could have. For\nexample, despite the fact that Civil War regiments had the potential to kill 500-1000 individuals per\nminute, the actual rate was only 1-2 per minute. This suggests that under some conditions, killing another\nwhen you can see the whites of their eyes is hard. But as the history of genocides reveal, we have\nevolved ways to bypass this limitation, making us killophilic in a variety of situations. Our brain’s unique\ncapacity for denial is one of the liberating factors.\nBy recruiting denial into our psychology’s artillery, we invented new ways of perceiving the\nenemy or creating one, distorting reality in the service of feeding a desire for personal gain. Denial, like\nso many aspects of our psychology, generates beneficial and toxic consequences. Self-deceiving\nourselves into believing that we are better than we are is a positive illusion that often has beneficial\nconsequences for our mental and physical health, and for our capacity to win in competition. Denying\nothers their moral worth by reclassifying them as threats to our survival or as non-human objects is toxic\nthinking. When we deny others their moral worth, the thought of killing them is no longer aversive or\ninappropriate. If we end someone’s life in defense of our own, we are following our evolved capacity for\nsurvival. When we destroy a parasite, we are also protecting our self-interests to survive. And when we\ndestroy an inanimate object or lock it away, there is no emotional baggage because we have bypassed the\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 12\nconnection to individual rights; we have cut out morality as the governor. This suite of transformations,\nenabled by our promiscuous brain, allowed us to occupy a unique position within the animal kingdom as\nlarge scale killers.\nChimpanzees only kill adults when there are many attackers against one victim, with the vast\nmajority of kills focused on individuals outside of their own group; most kills within the group are aimed\nat infants, where the costs to the attacker are low. Though humans also kill members of enemy groups\nwhen there are many against one ⎯⎯ a pattern that is common among hunter-gatherers and other smallscale\nsocieties ⎯⎯ we depart from this narrow pattern in terms of numbers and the array of potential\nvictims. When humans kill, we go at it with many against many, one against one, and even one against\nmany, including as victims both those outside of our group and those within, young and old, same and\nopposite sex, and mating partner and competitor.\nAdd the chimpanzee’s adaptive capacity for coalitionary killing to the promiscuous capacity of\nthe human brain, and we arrive at a uniquely aggressive species, one capable of inflicting great harm on\nothers in any context. Though the modern invention of scud missiles and stealth bombers undoubtedly\nenriched our capacity to kill on a large scale by putting distance between killers and victims, these\nweapons of mass destruction were not necessary. Today, we need only travel back a few years to 1994 to\nwitness the machete genocides of Rwanda, a painful memory of our capacity to wipe out close to a\nmillion people in 100 days with hand to hand combat. This is excessive harm, enabled by our ability to\nuse denial to minimize the perceived costs of killing another person and to motivate the anticipated\nbenefits. Denial turns down the heat of killing another and turns us into callous predators.\nEvolutionary changes in the connections to the brain’s reward system provided a second, costoffsetting\nstep, allowing us to move into novel arenas for harming others. When an animal wins a fight,\nthe reward circuitry engages, providing a physiological pat on the back and encouragement for the next\nround. This same circuitry even engages in anticipation of a battle or when watching winners. The\nreward system is important as it motivates competitive action in situations that are costly. There is one\nsituation, however, where the reward system is remarkably quiet, at least in all social animals except our\nown: detecting and punishing those who attempt to cheat and free-ride on others’ good will.\nPunishment carries clear costs, either paid up front in terms of resources expended on physically\nor psychologically attacking another, or paid at the end if the victim fights back or retaliates. These costs\ncan be offset if punishers and their group benefit by removing cheaters or teaching them a lesson. Among\nanimals, punishment is infrequently seen in vertebrates, especially our closest relatives the nonhuman\nprimates. When it is seen, the most common context is competition, not cooperation. Like lethal killing,\nthen, punishment in animals tends to be restricted to a narrow context. Like lethal killing, punishment in\nanimals is psychologically monogamous.\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 13\nPunishment in humans is emblematically promiscuous. We castigate others whenever they\nviolate a social norm, in both competitive and cooperative situations, targeting kin and non-kin.\nPunishment is doled out by the individual directly harmed and also by third party onlookers. We use both\nphysical and non-physical means to discipline cheaters, including ostracism. Punishment’s landscape is\nvast.\nThe idea I develop here, building on the work of scholars in economics, psychology, and\nanthropology, is that our species alone circumvented the costs of punishment as an incidental\nconsequence of promiscuity, including an intimate coupling between the systems of aggression and\nreward. As several brain imaging studies reveal, when we either anticipate or actually punish another, or\neven witness punishment as a mere bystander, our reward circuitry delivers a honey hit. Delivering just\ndeserts, or watching them delivered, is like eating dessert. We absorb the costs of punishment by feeling\ngood about ratting out the scourges, banishing them from society, and sometimes from life itself.\nIronically, as the economist Samuel Bowles has suggested based on mathematical models and a synthesis\nof the historical record, punishment can strengthen solidarity and cooperation within the group, while\nsimultaneously enhancing antagonism and prejudice toward those outside the inner sanctum. Ironically,\nthe psychology that benefited cooperation among like-minded others may also have functioned to destroy\nthose who have different beliefs and values.\nThe emergence of promiscuous punishment was a momentous event in human history, a\ncelebration of exquisite brain evolution and adaptive design. But this achievement carried a hidden cost, a\ndebt that we continue to pay: A mind capable of feeling good about punishing in the name of virtue is a\nmind capable of doing bad to feel good. It is a mind that finds real or simulated violence entertaining and\nseeks ways to satisfy this interest. It is a mind that enjoys watching others suffer while singing O\nSchadenfreude. It is a mind that is capable of feeling good about killing others who are perceived as\nparasitic on society. It is a mind that can override the anticipated costs of killing by fueling a taste for\nkilling.\nDesire, denial, aggression and reward are each associated with specific psychological processes,\ndistinct evolutionary histories, and specific adaptive problems. When processed by a promiscuous brain,\nthese systems connect in ways that are both beneficial to human welfare and deeply deleterious.\nHow? Evil occurs when individuals and societies allow desire for personal gain to combine with\nthe denial of others’ moral worth to justify the use of excessive harms. Everyone has desires, resources\nthey want and experiences they seek. Our desires motivate us into action, often to fulfill personal needs or\nto help others. We all desire good health, fulfilling relationships, and knowledge to explain the world.\nSome also desire great wealth and power, each culture weighing in on its signature vision of what counts:\nmoney, land, livestock, wives, and subordinates. The desire system motivates action in the service of\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 14\nrewarding experiences. Some actions have benign or even beneficial consequences for the welfare of\nothers, while others have malignant and costly consequences.\nExquisite studies pioneered by the American cognitive neuroscientist Kent Berridge have\nuncovered the core elements of pleasure, including distinctive systems of wanting, liking and learning.\nWe, and hundreds of other species, often want things we like, and like things we want. This is, obviously,\nan adaptive coupling. Thanks to experiments at the level of genes, neurons, and behavior, we can tease\napart these three systems. Thanks to naturally occurring situations, we can watch these systems come\nunglued over the course of addictions, leading to the paradoxical and maladaptive situation of wanting\nmore and more, but liking the experience less and less. Addictions, as archetypal examples of excess,\nprovide a model for thinking about evil and its trademark signature of excessive harm.\nThe paradoxical decoupling between wanting and liking is seen most clearly in studies of obesity\nin rats and humans, where individuals develop skyrocketing desires for food, but fail to experience\ncomparable pleasure from eating. By definition, those who become obese are prone to eat in excess. One\nreason they do is because eating, or even seeing images of food, no longer delivers the same honey hit to\nthe brain as in their pre-obesity days. The reward system turns off when we turn to excess. This is\nadaptive because nothing in excess is good. But because the wanting system runs independently, the\nadaptive response by the liking system has the unfortunate consequence of making us want more even\nthough we enjoy it less. The proposal I develop in this book is that the same process is involved in evil,\nespecially its expression of excessive harm. It is a process that is aided by denial.\nEveryone engages in denial, negating certain aspects of reality in order to manage painful\nexperiences or put forward a more powerful image. But like desire, denial has both beneficial and costly\nconsequences for self and others. When we listen to the news and hear of human rights violations across\nthe globe, we often hide our heads in the sand, plug our ears, and carry on with our lives as if all is okay\non planet Earth. When doctors have to engage in slicing into human flesh to perform surgery, they turn\noff their compassion for humanity, treating the body as a mechanical device, at least until the surgery is\nover, and the patient awakes, speaks and smiles. When we confront a challenging opponent in an athletic\ncompetition or military confrontation, we often pump ourselves up, tricking our psychology into believing\nthat we are better than we are. Denial turns down the heat of emotion, allowing a cooler approach to\ndecision making and action. But doctors in denial concerning the moral worth of others can be convinced\nto carry out heinous operations for the “good” of science or the purity of their group, and military leaders\nin denial of an opponent’s strength can lead their soldiers to annihilation. Individuals in denial can reject\ndifferent aspects of reality in the service of reward, whether it is personal gain, avoiding pain, or enabling\nthe infliction of pain on others.\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 15\nIn a competitive world with limited resources, our desire system never rests. This is a good thing\nas it motivates us to take care of our self-interests and strive for bigger and better. But a desire system\nthat never sleeps is a system that is motivated to accrue ever larger coffers or power. To satisfy this\ninflationary need is often not possible without harming others, either directly or indirectly. To offset the\ncosts of harming another, desire recruits denial. This is a recipe for evil and the creation of excessive\nharms. It is a recipe that takes two, often benign and highly adaptive ingredients that are essential for\nmotivating action and promoting survival, and combines them into an explosive outcome. Seen in this\nway, our capacity for evil is as great as our capacity for love and compassion. Evil is part of human\nnature, a capacity that can’t be denied. What I will show is both how this capacity works, and how some\nof us, due to biological inheritance and environmental influence, are more likely to end up as evildoers.\nHistorical material on the lives of Franz Stangl and Adolf Eichmann, leaders in the Nazi\nannihilation of Jews, illustrates how desire and denial combine within individual minds to create\nexcessive harms. Although this is a historical example, focused on the lives of only two men, stories like\ntheirs have been recounted hundreds of times, all over the globe and across time. This pattern points to\ncommon mechanisms, identified in detail by the sciences of human nature.\nStangl was a politically motivated man with a burning desire to climb to the top of the Nazi\nhierarchy. A clear path opened when he was appointed commander of the Polish prison Treblinka.\nUnbeknownst to Stangl, Treblinka was one of the Nazi’s concentration death camps. To fulfill his desire\nfor power therefore required harming thousands of others, or more accurately, commanding Nazi soldiers\nto harm others on his behalf. But since Stangl had no burning desire to harm the Jews, he dehumanized\nthem, transforming living, breathing, feeling, and thinking people into lifeless “cargo” ⎯⎯ his own\nexpression. Stangl was dry-eyed as officers under his command killed close to one million Jews, one\nthird of them children. The reward? Power and status within the Nazi hierarchy. The death of innocent\nJews was a foreseen consequence of Stangl’s desire for power, not his direct goal.\nEichmann, Lieutenant Colonel in the Nazi regime, was considered one of the central architects of\nthe Final Solution, the master plan for the extermination of Jews. Eichmann denied Jews their humanity\nby championing the pamphlets and posters that portrayed them as vermin and parasites. This\ndehumanizing transformation empowered Eichmann’s belief that cleansing was the only solution to\nGerman integrity and power. Eichmann’s reward? Elimination of the Jews. Unlike Stangl, killing Jews\nwas rewarding. As the historian Yaacov Lozowick stated “Eichmann and his ilk did not come to murder\nJews by accident or in a fit of absent-mindedness, nor by blindly obeying orders or by being small cogs in\na big machine. They worked hard, thought hard, took the lead over many years. They were the alpinists of\nevil.”\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 16\nStangl and Eichmann: two different routes into evil. Both possible and both equally lethal to\nhumanity.\nThis is a lean explanation of why evil evolved and how it develops within individuals and\nsocieties. It is an explanation that strips evil down to its root causes, focusing on the core psychological\ningredients that enable us to violate moral norms and cause excessive harms to innocent others.\nA difficult journey\nThis book takes you on a journey into evil. It is a story about our evolutionary past, our present state of\naffairs, and the prospects for our future. It is as much a story about you and me, as it is about all of our\nancestors and future children. It is a story about the nature of moral decay and the prospects of moral\ngrowth. It is story about society’s capacity to engineer great harm, and about our own individual\nresponsibility to avoid joining in.\nExplaining how our genes create brains that create a psychology of desire and denial that leads to\nexcessive harms provides a satisfying explanation for the landscape of evil. It explains all varieties of evil\nby showing how particular genetic combinations can create moral monsters and how particular\nenvironmental conditions can convert good citizens into uncaring killers and extortionists. This\nexplanation will not allow us to banish evil from the world. Rather, it will enable us to understand why\nsome individuals acquire an addiction to feeling good by making others feel bad, and why others cause\nunimaginable harm to innocent victims while flying the flag of virtue. This, in turn, will help us gain\ngreater awareness of our own vulnerabilities by monitoring the power of attraction between desire and\ndenial.\nHauser Prologue. Evilution 17\nEndnotes: Prologue.

Evilution 19\nChapter 1:\nNature’s secrets\nNature hides her secrets because of her essential loftiness, but not by means of ruse.\n— Albert Einstein\nIn Charles Darwin’s day, biologists unearthed the mysteries of evolution by means of observation,\nsometimes accompanied by a simple experiment. This was largely a process of documenting the patterns\nof variation and uniformity that nature left behind. Only breeders were directly involved in manipulating\nthese patterns, using artificial selection to alter the size, shape, coloration, and lifespan of plants and\nanimals.\nThe Darwins of today continue this tradition, but with new tools, informed by understanding of\nthe genetic code and aided by technical developments in engineering, physics, chemistry, and computer\nscience. These tools allow for deeper penetration into the sources of change, and the causes of\nevolutionary similarities and differences. They also enable biologists to change the course of evolution\nand the patterns of development by turning genes off or turning novel ones on, and even creating\nsynthetic organisms in test tubes ⎯⎯ a wonderful playground for understanding both questions of origin,\nchange, and extinction.\nThe Darwins of today are cowboys, trailblazing a new frontier of understanding. But like the\nfrontier of the early American wild west, nature holds many secrets and surprises. Sometimes when we\nbreak through nature’s guard, we gain fundamental truths about the living world, knowledge that can be\nharnessed to improve animal and human welfare. But sometimes when we break through, we create toxic\nconsequences and ethical dilemmas. Tampering with nature is risky business as there are many hidden\nand unforeseen consequences.\nIn 1999, the molecular biologist Joe Tsien and his team at Princeton University tampered with\nmother nature. Their discovery, published in a distinguished scientific journal, soon filled the\nnewspapers, radio airwaves, and even a spot on Dave Letterman’s late night television show. Tsien\nmanipulated a gene that was known to influence memory, causing it to work over time. This created a\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 20\nnew line of mice with a special accessory: an upgraded memory and learning system. When these new\nand improved mice ran through an IQ test, they outperformed normal mice.\nTsien pulled off an extraordinary engineering trick, creating a lineage of smarter mice. This is\ncowboy science, showing the power of genetic tampering to open the door to evolutionary changes. In a\nworld of competition, one would imagine that selection should favor these smart mice who have better\nrecall of essential foraging routes, previous social interactions, and places to rest out of harm’s way from\npredators. But in biology, there are always trade-offs. Benefits in one area of life are often accompanied\nby costs in others.\nSeveral months after Tsien’s report, a follow-up study of the same memory-enhanced mice\nappeared in print, also in a distinguished scientific journal. But this time there was no media fanfare. The\nnew work was carried out by Min Zhuo at Washington University, an ex-member of Tsien’s lab and a coauthor\nof the original paper. Zhuo’s new paper confirmed that memory-enhanced mice were indeed\nsmarter, but also showed that they were more sensitive to pain, licking their wounds more and for longer\nperiods of time than normal mice. Though it is unclear whether Zhuo’s results reveal heightened pain\nsensitivity, stronger memories for pain, or some combination of these and other processes, what is clear is\nthat the engineering that led to smarter mice led to much more.\nTsien and Zhuo’s work shows that even with targeted, artificial changes in the underlying\nbiology, unanticipated consequences are common. It also shows that deep within the biology of every\norganism lies hidden capacities and potential for change. Unleashing these sub rosa capacities can have\nboth beneficial and costly consequences for the individual and group.\nThe idea I develop in this chapter is that our capacity for evil evolved as an incidental, but natural\nconsequence of our uniquely engineered brain. Unlike any other species, our brain promiscuously\ncombines and recombines thoughts and emotions to create a virtually limitless range of solutions to an\never-changing environment. This new form of intelligence enabled us to solve many problems, but two\nare of particular interest given their adaptive consequences: killing competitors and punishing cheaters in\na diversity of contexts. But like the painful fall-out from artificially engineering a smarter mouse, so too\nwas there fall-out from the natural engineering of a smarter human: a species that experiences pleasure\nfrom harming others. This is part of the recipe for evil.\nThis chapter sets out the evidence to support the idea that evil evolved as an incidental\nconsequence of our brain’s design. I begin by discussing the two general processes that landed us in the\nunforeseen and uninhabited niche of evildoers: the evolution of byproducts and promiscuous connections\nwithin the human brain. Because these are general processes, we will take a short reprieve from matters\nspecifically evil.\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 21\nWhat’s it for?\nAbout 50 million years ago, a family of insects ⎯⎯ the Phylliinae ⎯⎯ evolved a distinctive piece of\nanatomy: a body that looks like a leaf. They also evolved the capacity for catalepsy or statuesque\nstillness. Their leafy body is so exquisitely designed that even predators with superb search images are\nfooled as they walk or fly by. But from the fact that the leafy body provides these insects with an\ninvisibility cloak, and the fact that this enables them to escape predation, we cannot conclude that the\nleafy body evolved for predator evasion. What something is used for today may be different from what it\nevolved for ⎯⎯ the difference between current utility and original function. To show that the leafy body\nevolved for predator evasion, we need to know more, which we do. For one, the leafy body is paired up\nwith a requisite behavioral adaptation: turning to stone. If leaf insects fluttered about as actively as any\nother insect, their motion alone would cry out to the predators. Optimal effectiveness requires acting like\na leaf. But acting like a leaf without the leafy body has its own independent benefits, paying off in terms\nof predator evasion, as well as sneaking up on potential mates. It would therefore make good sense if\nstillness evolved first followed by a leafy body. This is precisely what evolution’s record reveals.\nThe adaptive advantage that comes from statuesque stillness and a leafy camouflage can only be\nmeasured against the backdrop of today’s predator line-up. If some future-predator evolves more\nsophisticated abilities to discriminate real leaves from faux leaves, the Phylliinae will be out of luck. This\nnew pressure from predators will, in turn, push for new evasive tricks, thus initiating the classic cycle of\npredator-prey evolution. What is adaptive for the Phylliinae today, may not be adaptive tomorrow.\nThe comparative study of the Phylliinae raises a class of questions posed by all evolutionary\nbiologists, independently of their taxonomic biases or interests in physiology, morphology, or behavior:\nHow did it originally evolve? What adaptive problem did it solve? Did it evolve to solve one adaptive\nproblem, but over time shift to solve another ⎯⎯ a case of what the late evolutionary biologist Stephen J.\nGould referred to as an exaptation? Does the exaptation generate profits or losses for survival and\nreproduction? Is the trait associated with byproducts, incidental consequences of the evolutionary\nprocess? What effects, if any, do these byproducts have on survival and reproduction? These questions\napply with equal force to evil as they do to language, music, mathematics, and religion. The fact that evil,\nrelative to a leafy body, is more difficult to define, harder to measure, and impossible to experiment upon\n⎯⎯ at least ethically ⎯⎯ doesn’t mean we should take it off the table of scientific inquiry. What it means is\nthat we must be clear about what we can understand, and how we can distinguish between the various\ninterpretations on offer. When we explore the evolution of evil, what are we measuring and what evidence\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 22\nenables us to distinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive explanations? To answer this question, let us\nlook at two illustrative examples that are more challenging than leafy coverage in insects: the evolution of\ntameness and religion.\nSheep, goats, cows, cats, and dogs are all domesticated animals, created by the forces of artificial\nselection. All have been transformed from a wild type to an animal that not only lives with us, but\nsometimes lives for us as food. All are more relaxed, less fearful, and less stressed in the presence of\nhumans than their wild ancestors. Many of these animals seek human companionship. These are the\ntrademark features of tameness. They are also consistently associated with other features that never\nentered into the breeder’s calculations: floppier ears, curlier tails, more mottled fur, greater sensitivity to\nhuman communication, reduced response to predators, earlier sexual maturation, smaller brains, and\nhigher levels of serotonin — a chemical messenger of the brain that regulates self-control. Some of these\nfeatures appear directly relevant to tameness, whereas others appear entirely irrelevant. For example,\nserotonin is critically linked to self-control which is critically linked to an animal’s ability to suppress\naggression when threatened, which is critically linked to building a life with humans. Mottled fur is not\ncritically linked to any of these benefits.\nDomestication leads to a pastiche of characteristics, some indicative of the domesticator’s goals\nand others orthogonal to it. How does the process of domestication, and artificial selection in particular,\ngenerate both desired and unanticipated traits?\nIn most cases of animal domestication, we know little about how the wild type changed because\nthe only available information is either anecdotal or based on loose archaeological reconstructions.\nConsider the domestication of dogs from wolves, and especially the variability among dog breeds.\nThough it is clear that humans throughout history have bred dogs to serve particular functions, including\nherding, aggressive defense, and companionship, each of these personality styles is linked to other\nbehavioral and physiological traits. For example, breeds with high activity levels are smaller than breeds\nwith low activity levels, aggressive breeds have higher metabolic rates than docile breeds, and obedient\nbreeds live longer than disobedient breeds. Does selection for aggressiveness cause an increase in\nmetabolic rate or does selection for higher metabolic rate allow for heightened aggressiveness. Because\nthese are all correlations, we don’t know which trait pushed the other to change or whether both traits\nwere favored at the same time.\nThere are two situations that provide a more clear-cut understanding of which feature was favored\nby selection and which emerged as an incidental byproduct: controlled experiments and domestication\nefforts that resulted in unambiguously undesirable traits. In the 1950s, the Russian biologist Dmitry\nBelyaev set out to domesticate the wild silver fox. Over several generations, he selectively bred those\nindividuals who were most likely to allow a human experimenter to approach and hand them food. After\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 23\n45 years of selective breeding he got what he aimed for: a population of tame foxes, less fearful of\nhumans and more interested in playing with them. But Belyaev also got much more than he aimed for:\nthese tame foxes had floppier ears, curlier tails, smaller brains, higher serotonin levels, and much sharper\nsocial skills than their wild relatives. These tame foxes acquired the same package that virtually all other\ndomesticated mammals had acquired: some desired and desirable traits and some surprises.\nBelyaev’s study shows that even under highly controlled laboratory conditions, artificial selection\nleaves a trail of unanticipated consequences, traits that come along for the ride. This link between desired\nand unanticipated features arises because the genes that create these features are like coupled oscillators:\nchanges in the expression of one gene directly link to changes in the expression of others. At the level of\nthe traits ⎯⎯ the gene’s expressions ⎯⎯ some have no impact on survival or reproduction, while others may\nincrease or decrease these aspects of fitness. We can illustrate this point by looking at an example from\ndog breeders.\nSeveral hundred years ago, dog breeders used artificial selection to create snub-nosed breeds such\nas the pug, bull dog, and boxer. The idea was to satisfy our aesthetics for diminutive noses, and reduce\nthe size of the dog’s classically large protuberance. Over the course of several generations of picking the\nsmallest-nosed members of the litter, pugs, bull dogs, and boxers emerged. But they also emerged with\nan unanticipated and maladaptive health problem: all of these breeds have a harder time breathing and\nstaying cool than full-nosed or snouty dogs. No breeder would select for respiratory problems or an\ninability to stay cool. These traits emerged as costly byproducts of selection for a diminutive nose, and\nmore abstractly, as a byproduct of our aesthetics. As in Tsien’s experiments on memory enhanced mice,\nwhen we tamper with nature, we can cause great harm.\nResearch on the evolution of religion provides my second example of how to think about\nadaptations and byproducts. The different types of religion are like the different dog breeds: distinctive in\nmany ways, but with a large number of shared traits in common. Most religions have a set of rules for\ngroup membership and expulsion, ritual practices, and beliefs in the supernatural. These commonalities\nsuggest to some scholars that religion evolved to solve a particular problem, one that all humans confront.\nThat problem is large scale cooperation among unrelated strangers, a topic I pick up in greater detail\nfurther on in this chapter. Other species cooperate, usually with a small number of individuals, mostly\nclose kin. As the size of potential cooperators grows, and genetic relatedness among individuals within\nthe group shrinks ⎯⎯ adding more unfamiliar strangers to the mix ⎯⎯ the potential risks of cooperating\nwith a cheater increases. Religion, and its core features, evolved to diminish this risk and increase the\nodds of developing a society of stable cooperators. Viewed from this perspective, religion is an adaptation\n⎯⎯ in the evolved for sense.\nFor those scholars who favor the idea of religion as adaptation, supporting evidence comes from\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 24\nanalyses of historical data together with experiments. Religious groups show higher levels of\ncooperation, often over longer periods of time, than many other organized, but non-religious groups.\nReligious groups also tend to last longer as groups than non-religious organizations or institutions.\nCooperation among religious groups is often facilitated by punishment or the implication of punishment\nfrom a deity. In a study of 186 societies by the biologist Dominic Johnson, analyses showed that those\nwho believed in a strong moralizing god, capable of doling out punishment, engaged in higher levels of\ncooperation, including paying taxes, complying with norms, and repaying loans. These observations are\ncomplimented by experiments showing that people are more generous about giving away their money in a\nbargaining game, and less likely to cheat, when they think about words associated with religion — divine,\nGod, spirit, sacred, prophet — than when they think about neutral words. For example, in the dictator\ngame, involving two anonymous players, one decides how much of a pot of money to give to the other.\nThe recipient has no say, and is thus stuck with whatever the donor offers. In general, donors give either\nnothing or about half. When primed to think about religion, donors are more likely to give than keep the\nentire pot, and give more as well.\nThe implication of these results is that the religiously-minded feel that they are being watched.\nCueing up words that are indicative of their religious beliefs, heightens their vigilance and their moral\nobligations. Religion fuels altruism and fends off the temptation to cheat.\nAll of the observations and experiments discussed above are fascinating and relevant to\nunderstanding the role of religion in past and present societies. But this evidence is irrelevant for\nunderstanding the evolutionary origins of religion. It is irrelevant because it can’t determine whether\nreligion originally evolved to solve the problem of large scale cooperation among strangers or whether it\nevolved for other reasons but was then used in the context of cooperation. This alternative explanation\nsees religion as an exaptation. No one doubts that religion provides social cohesion. No one doubts that\nreligion also sends a buzzing reminder to the brain’s moral conscience center. But from a description of\nwhat it does today, or even in the distant past, we can’t conclude that it evolved for this purpose. That\nreligious organizations show higher levels of cooperation than non-religious groups doesn’t mean they\nevolved for cooperation. We also can’t conclude that religion’s effectiveness as social glue relies on\nuniquely religious psychological thoughts and emotions. Though the creation of and belief in\nsupernatural powers may be unique to religion, other foundational beliefs and emotions are shared across\ndifferent domains of knowledge: young children attribute intentions, beliefs and desires to unseen causes,\nincluding the movement of clouds and leaves; non-religious moral systems use punishment to embarrass,\nrecruit regret, and fuel shame; like many religions, non-religious institutions also attempt to reprogram the\nthoughts and beliefs of its members ⎯⎯ think of all the global rebel operatives that brainwash innocent\nchildren into becoming child soldiers. Religion helps itself to non-religious psychology. The utility of\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 25\nreligion looks like a case of exaptation ⎯⎯ an expression of human thoughts and emotions that originally\nevolved to solve problems other than cooperation, but once in place were swiftly adopted for solving\nproblems of cooperation.\nFurther evidence in support of religion as exaptation comes from a follow-up to the dictator game\nexperiment discussed above. If you swap religious words for non-religious but moral words such as civic,\nduty, jury, court and police, you get the same results: people give more money when thinking about these\nmorally-pregnant, but non-religious words. It is also the case that if you paste up a photograph of eyes\nnext to a money box for coffee, people give more than with a photograph of flowers. What these two\nstudies show is that words and images that make us think about others, especially the possibility that\nothers are watching, turns us into bigger spenders. These psychological transformations are not, however,\nspecific to religion. Some may think that God is watching, but they and others may also think of a whitebearded,\ngavel-wielding, atheistic judge.\nWe learn three important lessons from the study of tameness and religion, lessons that will propel\nour discussion of evil. First, distinguish what something evolved for from what it is used for. Second,\ndissect complicated traits down into their component parts as the parts, together with their interdependence,\nmay have different evolutionary histories. Third, the combination of independently evolved\ncapacities can lead to novel adaptations and possibilities. Some combinations lead to altruistic and\nhumane compassion toward those we don’t know. Others lead to virulent hatred and annihilation of those\nwe do know. The brain’s promiscuity is a driving engine for both the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nFrom the shackles of monogamy to the freedom of promiscuity\nMany years ago, some American friends of mine were married in a small village in Tanzania. After the\nwedding, they went to a local official who was responsible for providing a marriage certificate. On the\ncertificate were three choices, indicative of the type of marriage: Monogamous, Polygynous, and\nPotentially Polygynous. My friends chuckled, but aimed their pen with confidence at Monogamous.\nBefore they could ink the certificate, however, several Tanzanian men shouted out “NO! At least\nPotentially Polygynous. Give yourself the option.” Right, the option. The freedom to explore.\nAmong social animals, only a few species pair bond for life, or at least a very long time. This fact\nis equally true of the social mammals: less than 5% of the 4000 or so species are strictly monogamous.\nFor these rare species, most of their efforts to think, plan, and feel are dedicated to their partner; what’s\nleft over goes into finding food and avoiding becoming dinner. Life is much more complicated for the rest\nof the social animals. Their social and sexual relationships are more promiscuous, less stable and less\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 26\npredictable. This unpredictability is partially responsible for changes in the brain. Promiscuous mating\nsystems demand more flexibility, creativity and out of the box thinking.\nThe anthropologist Steve Gaulin explored the idea that a species’ mating system is directly\nrelated to its capacity to think. Gaulin started by looking at two closely related species of voles, one\nmonogamous and the other polygynous. In the polygynous vole, males typically mate with multiple\nfemales. To achieve this kind of mating success, males have large territories that encompass many\nsmaller female territories. In the monogamous species, the male and female share the same territory, with\nmating restricted to the couple. These differences in mating system and space usage have two direct\nconsequences: relative to the monogamous male vole, the polygynous male vole must travel much further\nin a day than the females and must recall where the female territories are located. For a polygynous male\nvole, mating success depends on long day trips, visiting each of the female territories. For the\nmonogamous male vole, there are no physical or memory challenges as the female is virtually always\nnearby. Given the costs to a polygynous male vole of forgetting where the females live, there should be\nstrong selection on the memory system. Gaulin confirmed this prediction by showing that polygynous\nmale voles outcompete females of their species in a maze running competition, and also have larger\nmemory systems than females. In the monogamous vole, there are no sex differences in maze running or\nmemory.\nGaulin’s work provides a gorgeous example of how evolutionary pressures can act on the brain to\ncreate differences in psychological capacity. Other examples abound, including evidence that fruit eaters\nhave larger brains than leaf eaters, primates living in large social groups have larger frontal lobes than\nthose living in smaller groups, and bats living in open habitats have smaller brains than those living in\ncomplex closed habitats. In each case, a particular ecological or social pressure ⎯⎯ finding ripe fruit,\nupdating the status of numerous social relationships, avoiding obstacles while in flight ⎯⎯ sculpts\ndifferences in brain anatomy and function. Some of these pressures favor extreme specialization and\nmyopia, whereas others favor a broader vision. Relative to every healthy member of our species, all other\nanimals have tunnel vision. When our ancestors began to migrate out of Africa, the diversity of\nenvironments and social opportunities favored generalists with a broad and flexible vision.\nTo appreciate the significance of the human revolution in brain engineering, consider three cases\nof myopic, but highly adaptive intelligence in other animals, cases that lack the signature of intellectual\npromiscuity; these cases are of particular interest because they represent the kinds of examples that\ncaused Darwin to doubt the beneficence of God, to reflect upon the cruelty of nature, and to ponder the\nproblem of evil:\n• The wasp Ampulex compressa tackles a specific species of cockroach, inserts a\nfirst stinger into its body to cause leg paralysis and eliminate fighting, then a second\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 27\nstinger into the brain that causes intense auto-grooming followed by three weeks of\nlethargy. During this down time, the cockroach turns into a living meal for the wasp’s\nlarvae.\n•A Brazilian parasitoid wasp of the family Braconidae, lays its eggs inside a\nparticular species of caterpillar, and once the larvae are fully developed, they hatch out of\nthe caterpillar. Though it is strange enough for caterpillars to function like incubators,\nthese innocent larvae were anything but innocent while developing inside the caterpillar.\nOnce the larvae hatch, they are treated to an unprecedented level of care from the\ncaterpillar who, Gandhi-like, foregoes all eating and moving to protect its adopted young,\nincluding violent head-swings against any intruder. The wasp has effectively brainwashed\nthe caterpillar, hijacking its evolved instincts to care for its own young.\n•A solitary wasp in the genus Sceliphron selectively feeds on the dangerous and\nmuch larger black widow spider, using two tricks: it secretes a substance that is like\nTeflon, allowing it to move into a spider’s web without getting stuck; next, it flails\naround in the web to attract the spider, and once the spider is positioned above in kill\nmode, the wasp launches its stinger, piercing the spider right through the brain. End of\nblack widow. If the wasp makes the slightest mistake, end of wasp.\nThe capacity that has evolved in these wasps is myopically focused on one problem, and one problem\nalone. Despite the mind control and deception that is part of their evolved competence, they don’t deploy\nthese skills in any other context. This highly adaptive and monogamous pattern of thinking runs\nthroughout the animal kingdom and across different contexts, including male cleaner fish that attack\nfemale cleaner fish who violate the rules of mucus-eating from their clients, but do not deploy such\ndraconian measures in other situations; birds that feign injury to deter predators from their nest, but\ndeceive in no other context; cheetah mothers who demonstrate to their cubs how to bring down prey, but\nnever provide pedagogical instructions in other relevant domains of development; and monkeys that\nunderstand how to use tools generously provided by humans but never create any of their own.\nLike other animals, we too are equipped with adaptive capacities that evolved to solve particular\nproblems. Unlike other animals, however, these same adaptive specializations are readily deployed to\nsolve novel problems, often by combining capacities. Like wasps, we deceive, manipulate and parasitize\nothers, often cruelly. But unlike wasps, we don’t use these abilities with one type of victim in one context.\nAs long as the opportunity for personal gain is high relative to the potential cost, we are more than willing\nto deceive, manipulate, and parasitize lovers, competitors and family members. When we attack rule\nviolators, not only do we do so in the context of cheaters who eat but don’t pay, but also deadbeat dads\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 28\nwho fail to care for their young, cads who have extramarital affairs, and trigger-happy murderers who\ntake the lives of innocent people. What changes in the brain enabled us, but no other species, to engage in\npromiscuous thinking?\nTo understand what changed in the brain, it is useful to paint a few broad-stroke comparisons, and\nthen narrow in on the details. We know, for example, that brain size changed dramatically over the\ncourse of our evolutionary history, ultimately reaching three times the size of a chimpanzee’s brain with\nthe appearance of the first modern humans some 100-200,000 years ago. From the archaeological\nevidence, we can infer that some aspect of the internal workings of the brain ⎯⎯ not simply size ⎯⎯ must\nhave changed at about the same time in order to explain the appearance of a new material culture of tools\nwith multiple parts and functions, musical instruments, symbolically decorated burial grounds, and cave\npaintings. Before this period, the material culture of our ancestors was rather uncreative, with simple tools\nand no symbolism. The new material culture was heralded by a mind unlike any other animal. No other\nanimal spontaneously creates symbols, though chimpanzees and bonobos can be trained to acquire those\nwe invent and attempt to pass on. No other animal creates musical instruments or even uses their own\nvoice for pure pleasure. No other animal buries its dead, no less memorializes them with decorations; ants\ndrag dead members out of their colony area and deposit them in a heap, though this is driven by hygiene\nas opposed to ceremonial remembrance and respect. Only a species with the capacity to combine and\nrecombine different evolved specializations of the brain could create these archaeological remains. This\nperiod in our evolutionary history marks the birth of our promiscuous brain. The brain sciences have\nhelped us see the fine details of this new species of mind.\nThe comparative anatomists Ralph Holloway, James Rilling, and Kristina Aldridge have\nanalyzed brain scans and skull casts of humans and all of the apes: chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas,\norangutans, and gibbons. This sample represents approximately 15 million years of evolution, and\nincludes considerable diversity in mating systems, dietary preferences, use of tools, group size, life span,\nlocomotion style, communication system, aggressiveness, and capacity for cooperation. Thus, gibbons are\nmonogamously pair bonded, live in small family groups in the upper canopies, swinging and singing to\ndefend their territories, never use or create tools, are omnivorous, restrict cooperation to within the\nfamily group, and show little aggression. Gorillas are folivores or leaf eaters, live in harem societies,\nknuckle walk on the ground, rarely use or make tools in the wild, show aggression primarily between\nharems, communicate with a diversity of sounds, and show limited cooperation even under captive\nconditions. Chimpanzees are promiscuous, omnivores who hunt for meat on the ground and in the tree\ntops, create a diversity of tools that are culturally distinctive between regions, communicate with a\ndiversity of sounds, are lethal killers when they confront individuals from a neighboring community, and\nare cooperative especially in competitive situations. Despite this diversity, nonhuman ape brains are much\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 29\nmore similar to each other than any one is to a human brain. What changed since we split off from our ape\ncousins is both the overall geometry of the brain in terms of the relative size of different components, as\nwell as the connections both within and between these components. Some of the most spectacular\nchanges evolved within the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as their connections to other areas of the\nbrain involved in the control of emotion and stress. These circuits play a critical role in decision making,\nself control, short-term memory, social relationships, tool use and language.\nFor detail, and further evidence of the importance of connectivity in promiscuous thinking, we\nturn to brain imaging studies of healthy adults, developing children, and patient populations that lack the\nsignature of promiscuity. Consider tool use. Though a wide variety of nonhuman animals use tools, only\nhumans create tools that combine different materials, have multiple functioning parts, can be used for\nfunctions other than the one originally designed, and function in the context of survival, reproduction, and\nleisure. These properties are the signature of a promiscuous brain. When we look at the material culture of\nthe most sophisticated animal tool user ⎯⎯ the chimpanzee ⎯⎯ we see tools that use a single material, have\nonly a single functional part, are only designed for one function, and the function set is strictly limited to\nsurvival or reproduction. Something as simple as a pencil, beyond the chimpanzees’ wildest imagination,\nconsists of multiple materials (rubber, wood, lead, metal), was designed for writing but can be used for\npoking or keeping hair up in a bun, and has two functional parts (lead for writing, rubber for erasing).\nWhen you put a human subject in a brain scanner and record activity during observations of tool use,\nwhat you see is an orchestrated coordination between different and connected brain regions. There is\nactivity in regions carrying out spatial analyses, motor behavior, goal directed assessments, and object\nrecognition, and much of this activity is fed forward to the frontal areas for storage in working memory as\nwell as judgment and evaluation. A healthy adult brain is a heavily connected brain. Promiscuity results\nfrom a network of interconnected brain regions.\nEven resting brains show signs of promiscuity. When you lie down in bed and close your eyes,\nbut before you drift off to sleep, your brain ⎯⎯ assuming you are an adult and healthy ⎯⎯ shows activity in\na family of inter-connected brain regions called the default network. This is your brain at rest, but it is\nanything but at rest. Some of the most active areas involve those that are engaged when we evaluate\nsocial relationships, consider what others believe and desire, who they are, and how we might interact in\nthe future. This same default network looks very different in children, as well as in the elderly: it is much\nless connected. Growing up is connecting up. Growing old is disconnecting. We gain promiscuous\nthinking as we mature and lose it as we age.\nIf connection is key, then disorders of the mind or physical insult should result in predictable loss\nof promiscuity. A brain imaging study of individuals with autism is revealing. Individuals with autism\nfall along a spectrum, from low to high functioning. Though this spectrum captures important\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 30\ndifferences, all inflicted with this developmental disorder have difficulty understanding the beliefs,\nintentions and emotions of others, and often become hyper-aroused when seeing, hearing, or touching\nrather unremarkable objects or events. All of these capacities require a system that can integrate multiple\nsources of information. During brain scanning, individuals with autism show a striking reduction in\nactivity in an area called the insula and its connection to both the somatosensory cortex and amygdala.\nThe insula is an area of the brain that is like a traffic cop, responsible for coordinating the flow of\ninformation in the brain, both where it is coming from and where it should go. The somatosensory cortex\nhandles our body’s response to the world, including its state of arousal. The amygdala plays a key role in\nemotional processing, and more generally, in generating positive or negative assessments about the value\nof an experience. With the traffic cop asleep, and the body’s arousal and emotional hubs dormant, it is no\nwonder that those with autism lack empathy, can’t understand what it means for someone to be in love,\nare befuddled by deception, and find the bombardment from our media-intense world truly\noverwhelming. The lack of connectivity among those with autism is proof that connectivity is necessary\nfor promiscuous thinking.\nOnce we evolved our massively connected, promiscuous brain, tool use, communication,\nmathematics, music, and morality were transformed. No longer were we constrained to think within the\nconfines of the evolved context. We could take aspects of an ancient psychology that evolved for one\nproblem and use it for new purposes, some beneficial to us individually and as members of a group, and\nsome costly to our own and others’ survival.\nConsider our capacity to defend members within a group against attack from individuals outside\nthe group. Many, perhaps even the majority of religious groups have carried out this mission, some with\nviolence such as the Catholic-Protestant conflict in Ireland, and some with tranquility such as the\nTibetan’s plea for peace amidst a powerful Chinese oppressor. The process starts, however, with an\nancient system that we share with all socially living animals. To survive and reproduce, individuals\ncooperate with members of their own group and defend their resources against members of neighboring\ngroups. All animals, humans included, recognize group members by distinctive markings or recalling\nfeatures associated with specific individuals. We transformed this evolutionarily ancient capacity into a\ndistinctively human one by combining it with our systems of language, morality, and beliefs. This\ncombination allows us to use symbols to demarcate those within our group from those outside, to tie these\nsymbols to distinctive beliefs, values, and emotions, and to use these different psychological systems to\ncaricature the other as buffoon, vermin, parasite, or inanimate cargo. This combinatorial process allows\nus to cleanse the in-group by annihilating the out-group. It allows us to increase cooperation within a\ngroup while ramping up the defenses to take out enemies living outside the group. This strategy is\nsimple and effective. First, convince one group of people that another group has a set of undesirable traits,\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 31\nfeatures that will undermine the success of the in-group. This has the effect of tightening the bonds\nwithin the group. Next, convince the in-group that those undesirable qualities make the others less-thanhuman\nand barely nonhuman. Next, make sure that the nonhuman mascot for the out-group is vile,\nabhorrent, and disgusting. This ingredient is critical as it guarantees that each member of the in-group will\nfeel a surge of disgust every time it sees or hears of the out-group. Once disgust is in motion, there is\nonly one additional step: either destroy or purge the other of its vile qualities. Destruction is not only\npermissible, but morally obligatory, carried out guilt-free because the mind has taken the other out of the\nmoral domain and into the domain of property ⎯⎯ either dispensable, controllable or transformable.\nTaking out the other is rewarding. Harm feels good.\nOur uniquely promiscuous minds invented dehumanization, using a recipe of adaptive ingredients\n⎯⎯ defense against an enemy, disgust as a response to noxious and unhealthy substances, and creative\nlanguage use. This is a dangerous idea, one I develop in chapter 3. It is one of many capacities that\nenabled us to uniquely imagine new ways of inflicting excessive harm on others. It is a capacity that,\nnonetheless, has a deep evolutionary history.\nHARMING OTHERS, version 1.0: non-lethal behavioral routines\nAll animals are motivated to secure resources that will enable them to survive and reproduce. At the most\nbasic and universal level, this is what life is all about. Gaining access to resources enables individuals to\naccrue more resources, live longer, and produce more offspring. The path to acquiring resources is\ncomplicated by two facts of life that were central to Darwin’s insights into the process of evolution:\nresources are limited and individuals must compete with others from the same and different species for\nthese resources. Competition is the breeding ground for aggression ⎯⎯ the most basic means of harming\nothers. Aggression is a natural outcome of living in a social world where supper, sex, and space never\ncome prepared on a silver platter. Here I explore the core properties of non-lethal aggression, a manner of\nharming others that is part of every animals’ behavioral repertoire. This discussion sets the stage for\nunderstanding how evolution’s R&D operation enabled a transformation of the non-lethal form of\naggression into a lethal form, and ultimately, into an excessively lethal form that is the trademark of\nhuman evil. It also shows how the social norms guiding animal aggression evolved into moral norms, and\nthus, why we perceive some forms of aggression as deeply wrong, unethical and grotesque.\nConsider life on Earth before human existence, say 10 million years ago. Our closest living\nrelatives the chimpanzees and bonobos are living in the forests of Africa, and so too are dozens of other\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 32\nprimates, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects. And of course, there are animals\npopulating every other continent and the seas that surround them. Among the social animals ⎯⎯ those\nliving in groups ⎯⎯ the common form of aggression is one-on-one, and the context is typically\ncompetition over food, a place to rest, or access to a mate. Sometimes the aggression is initiated as an\nattack and sometimes it is in self-defense. Sometimes it is highly ritualized and planned, and sometimes it\nis a reactive free-for-all. Sometimes it occurs within the group and sometimes between. Severe injuries\narise, but deaths are rare. The aim is to resolve a competitive dispute by means of non-lethal aggression,\nand if possible, non-physical contact. If someone dies it is because an injury leaves them incapacitated or\nvulnerable to disease. It is not because their opponent aimed to kill. The ubiquity of non-lethal aggression\npoints to a suite of common biological ingredients, a core set of neurobiological, hormonal and\npsychological adaptations that constrain how animals fight.\nIt all starts with one individual perceiving a valuable resource that is within reaching distance of a\ncompetitor. What launches a first move and subsequently guides the process to its completion with a\nwinner and a loser? In some species there are rules of thumb that deflate any aggressive instincts before\nthey are launched, even though there are clear competitive interests. For example, in territorial lizards\nand birds, if an emigrating individual lands in an area and sees or hears another individual vigorously\ndisplaying ⎯⎯ push-ups with colorfully flashing neck sacs in lizards, vocal arias in birds ⎯⎯ they move on.\nThe rule: territory owners win, no questions asked. Another rule of thumb arises in species organized\naround either permanent or breeding-only harems: one male and many females. Two classic cases are the\nwell-studied hamadryas baboons of Ethiopia and the elephant seals of California. In both species, males\nare much larger than females, with elephant seals providing an extreme case ⎯⎯ the harem master can be\nten times bigger than the females he mates with. In hamadryas, no one challenges the male over access to\nthe females in his harem. Competition arises in acquiring females into a harem, a process that starts early,\nwith individual males recruiting juvenile females. In elephant seals, either one or a few males completely\nmonopolize the mating among the often hundred or more females within the harem. These males rule. As\nevidenced by genetic fingerprinting, virtually all of the offspring are sired by 1-3 males. No mating\ncompetition. Competition arises when the young turks try to wear down the harem master through\nrepeated challenges over the season. Eventually, often over the course of several mating seasons, the\nharem master loses a fight and hangs up his gloves.\nDominance hierarchies provide another set of rules or norms that guide competition, and thus\naggression. In general, irrespective of the species, high ranking animals outcompete low ranking animals\nfor access to resources. If the spread between two individuals within the hierarchy is large, the\nsubordinate acts like a migrating lizard or bird landing in a resident’s territory: no contest, no competition,\nno fighting. If the spread is less, say two individuals who hold adjacent positions within the hierarchy,\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 33\nthen other factors enter into the calculation. This is where things get interesting as these other factors\ndetermine the start and end of a contest.\nInsights into the dynamics of aggressive competition emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s\ndue to two fundamental developments within evolutionary biology. The first involved a marriage\nbetween economic game theory and evolutionary biology. This marriage was set up by the British\nevolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith who recognized that for any competitive interaction, there are\ndifferent strategies, each with different payoffs. Some strategies are more costly, but return greater\nbenefits. Others are more conservative and less costly, but return smaller benefits. How well any given\nstrategy does depends on its frequency in the population, and thus, on whether the particular strategy is\ndominant or rare. For example, consider a baboon troop with 20 adult males. Imagine that one of the\nmales decides to bare his canines, stand up on his two hind legs, and charge whenever anyone comes near\nhim and he is eating. This male is displaying his intent to attack at the slightest provocation. One could\nimagine that this would be very effective, especially if he is the only one displaying in this way. But if\nthis display pattern spreads, and all 19 other males do the same thing, then this strategy fails as it no\nlonger distinguishes among the 20 males in the troop. What evolutionary game theory tells us is that the\neffectiveness of a strategy depends on how common it is within the population. Power comes, in part,\nfrom being not too common or predictable.\nThe second development involved signaling theory, and a challenge to the traditional approach\nthat considered animal signals as truthful messengers of information. On the traditional view, when a\nmonkey bares his canines, he is signaling his motivation to attack. When a dog puts his tail between his\nlegs, he is signaling his submissive status. When a bird gives an alarm call, she is telling others that a\npredator is nearby. When a human smiles, he is conveying his desire for friendship. The new signaling\ntheory presented a challenge to this honest view of communication. Why, for example, wouldn’t\nindividuals lie, deceiving others into believing that they were really tough, meek, in danger, or friendly,\nonly to take advantage of the situation and gain added resources. Why, for example, wouldn’t a baboon\nwho was actually afraid, put on a tough-guy show and scare off his opponents? Why wouldn’t a dog who\nwas actually tough, send a submissive signal at the start of the interaction, cause his opponent to lower his\nguard, and then attack? Why wouldn’t a bird send an alarm in the absence of danger, knowing that others\nwill run for cover and leave all the food behind ⎯⎯ no competition? Why wouldn’t a human who actually\nwanted to lure in an innocent victim for robbery send a seductive smile? This line of questioning,\ndeveloped by the British evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins and John Krebs, led to a number of\nstudies showing that animals are engaged in a much more complicated and dynamic dance when they\ncompete. Static properties of the animal ⎯⎯ its height, weight, tail length, antler size ⎯⎯ indicate its raw,\nunfakeable ability to fight or what biologists call Resource Holding Potential or RHP. A deer with a large\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 34\nset of antlers has paid the costs of growth, and is thus, a serious opponent with considerable strength. A\ntall, heavy, long-tusked elephant bull has spent the time and energy to bulk up, and can throw this weight\naround in a fight. Added on to an animal’s RHP are dynamic properties, features that require energetic\ninvestment in the moment such as the loudness or duration of a vocalization, or the height of a jump\ndisplay. These dynamic properties form the foundation of competitive interactions, and the raw material\nfor assessments. When a resource is up for grabs, and no simple rule of thumb or RHP factor trumps,\nanimals assess each others’ displays, working out whether to flee or escalate. What, if anything in a\ndisplay, reflects the signaler’s true capacity and motivation?\nThe Israeli evolutionary biologist Amotz Zahavi provided a simple, yet far-reaching explanation\nof honest signaling. Honesty, in the animal world, is simply about prediction. When a kob standing on his\nterritorial mound charges toward another, to what extent does this display predict that he will continue the\nattack if the opponent doesn’t flee? Is he all smoke or does the display accurately predict the followthrough?\nWhen a mantis shrimp uses his powerful claw to thump the sand at an intruder, will he go\nfurther, thumping the intruder who continues to advance? Zahavi’s solution was based in economics:\nsignals are honest if and only if they are costly to produce, where cost is relative to current condition or\nhealth. If every kob can charge even if they are blowing smoke, the charge display carries no weight. It is\npure puffery and dishonest. If every mantis shrimp can thump with its appendage, and does so regardless\nof its current power, then sand thumping loses value. For a charging display or sand thumping to carry\nvalue, they have to be costly to produce and only those in good enough condition should be able to\ntolerate the costs. Numerous studies support Zahavi’s insight, including work on insects, crabs, birds, and\ngazelles, as well as hunter-gatherers and religious institutions. Hunter-gatherers do it by showing off and\nsharing their large prey capture, whereas religions do it by showing their commitment to long and\ninvolved ritual displays.\nThe vast majority of animal competition is settled by means of non-lethal aggression. Animals\nadopt different strategies, use rules of thumb, and engage in assessment in order to minimize the costs of\nbattle. This is version 1.0 of HARMING OTHERS. This version operates within every animal, humans\nincluded. Over time, some animals evolved hormonal and neural upgrades that changed how individuals\nexperienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, as well as changes in their willingness to take\nrisks. These upgrades inched animals closer to lethal aggression, pushed some right into it, and others\nover the top.\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 35\nHARMING OTHERS, version 1.1: microcontrollers\nIn any competitive situation, whether it is animals working out a strategy for maximizing the odds of\nobtaining food or humans working out a strategy for maximizing the odds of check mating an opponent’s\nking, someone will walk away as the winner and someone as the loser. Winning feels good and losing\nfeels bad. Winning fuels confidence, losing lowers self-esteem. Depending on the opponent, including\nwhat they look like and whether they are familiar or unfamiliar, it is possible to gauge the likelihood of\nwinning or losing in advance. Depending on the individual’s prior history of wins and losses, and details\nof his or her personality, some individuals will embrace the challenge of a high risk-high payoff strategy\nwhereas others will adopt a low-risk low payoff strategy. Winning, losing, and taking risks are all\nmediated by differences in hormone levels, neurochemicals, and patterns of brain activation. Some of\nthese differences are set by the individual’s biology, some change over the course of a year, some within a\nday, and some within the period of a brief glance that allows for an opponent to assess the competition.\nThese physiological processes are the microcontrollers that regulate an individual’s motivation to fight or\nflee, as well as the sense of reward and loss that accompanies winning and losing. These microcontrollers\nadaptively regulate the capacity to harm, at least until they malfunction. Malfunctions, whatever their\ncause, can convert healthy, defensive, competitive, and justifiable harms into over the top excessive and\nunethical harms.\nOne of the primary microcontrollers is the hormone testosterone. Though it is commonly assumed\nthat testosterone is a male hormone, it is also present in females, though at lower concentrations.\nTestosterone plays an essential role in both sexual and aggressive behavior in all social animals.\nTestosterone surges when males defend their territories, and also, when they recruit sexually available\nfemales. Stronger surges occur when individuals are challenged by competitors who want their territory,\nfood, mates, or position within a hierarchy. What this shows is that testosterone motivates animals within\nthe arena of competition.\nTestosterone also surges again after an individual wins a fight, and drops following a loss. This is\nhighly adaptive as it motivates winners to keep defending their resources, and motivates losers to give up\nand minimize future costs. Across a wide variety of species, humans included, winners are two times\nmore likely to win the next fight whereas losers are five times less likely to win the next fight. These\nwinner-loser effects are mediated by testosterone. In our own species, among male and female athletes,\nin sports including soccer, tennis and judo, winners show higher testosterone levels than losers. This\neffect even holds in non-physical competition, such as chess and stock trading. In a study of day traders\non the London Stock Exchange, those making the highest profits had the highest levels of testosterone.\nEven those who are simply witnesses to a winning competition show increases in testosterone, including\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 36\ncichlid fish spectators observing a winning fight, and soccer spectators seeing their team win the World\nCup.\nWhat many volumes of experiments reveal is that testosterone plays a fundamental role in social\nbehavior across the animal kingdom, motivating individuals to defend their resources, acquire additional\nresources when possible, develop confidence following victory, and gracefully walk away following\ndefeat. Testosterone influences behavior, and behavior influences testosterone. If an individual\nexperiences a challenge, this causes an increase in testosterone. The increase in testosterone heightens\nconfidence and risk-taking to defend the resources. Heightened confidence and risk-taking are often\nassociated with winning fights. Winning fights increases testosterone, bringing us full circle to the\nchallenges of social living.\nTestosterone is joined by several other microcontrollers, including at least one additional\nhormone ⎯⎯ cortisol ⎯⎯ two neurochemicals ⎯⎯ serotonin and dopamine ⎯⎯ and several brain areas that are\naffected by these hormones and neurochemicals. Our understanding of this assemblage, beautifully\nsynthesized by the psychologist Jack van Honk, accounts for both our adaptive and sometimes highly\nmaladaptive capacity to harm others.\nCortisol mediates the stress response in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals, including all ages of\nhuman mammals. When fear kicks in due to aggressive challenges from a dominant individual or from\nthe appearance of a predator, cortisol rises. When individuals confront uncertainty, cortisol rises. When\ncortisol levels are high, individuals are more sensitive to punishment and more likely to avoid social\ninteractions. Flipping the polarity around, when cortisol levels are low, individuals are more aggressive,\nmore reward focused, and less sensitive to punishment. Testosterone and cortisol therefore play within\nthe bodies of animals like two children sitting on opposite ends of a see-saw. When testosterone is up and\ncortisol is down, individuals are primed to harm others and take risks. When testosterone is down and\ncortisol is up, individuals are risk averse, less likely to harm and more likely to engage in friendly social\nbehavior.\nSerotonin, as noted earlier in the discussion of domestication, is primarily involved in selfcontrol.\nHigh serotonin levels are associated with behavioral inhibition, whereas low serotonin levels are\nassociated with disinhibition or impulsivity, as well as heightened aggression. Dopamine is linked to the\nexperience of reward, both in terms of predicting when it will occur and in motivating behavior that\nmaximizes the odds of obtaining the goods. When animals reach their goals or expect to obtain them,\nincluding food, mating, or winning a fight, the brain delivers a surge of dopamine. In humans, taking a\ndrug that increases the amount of dopamine, causes people to believe that they will feel more elated about\nan event in the future.\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 37\nTestosterone modulates these brain chemicals, suppressing serotonin in the service of heightening\naggression, and ramping up dopamine to add to the already reinforcing properties of testosterone. But\nlike dopamine, testosterone is also directly linked to the reward system. Mice will work a response lever\nto deliver testosterone, and humans become addicted to it. If you inject testosterone into a mouse while it\nis moving about, the location associated with the injection becomes tagged as a favorite spot in the\nlandscape, a place to revisit. Drug abusers and gamblers, two personality profiles associated with\nheightened experience of reward and poor self-control, have elevated levels of testosterone and dopamine.\nTwirling inside the brains and bodies of all social animals is a physiological ballet that controls\nthe capacity to harm others. This choreography links harming others with the experience of reward. In\nsome animals, the link between harm and reward was upgraded to a capacity for lethal aggression.\nHARMING OTHERS, version 1.5: upgrade to lethal aggression\nAll social animals have evolved the capacity for aggression, using it to fight members of their own\nspecies for food, land, and sex. For virtually all animals, winning a fight means chasing away or injuring\na competitor, but not killing them. There are, however, three situations in which animals kill, two are\nbroadly distributed across the animal kingdom and one is extremely rare. In virtually every taxonomic\ngroup of animals ⎯⎯ insects, reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and mammals ⎯⎯ there are predators and\nprey. Predators are not merely aggressive, but designed to kill prey species for the purpose of survival.\nAlso common is infanticide, situations in which adults kill infants. Infanticide is often committed by\nmales who have recently entered a group with infants sired by other males. By killing these infants, not\nonly does the newcomer obliterate the competition’s fitness, but he effectively reboots the female’s sexual\nreceptivity. Both predation and infanticide entail significant asymmetries in size or weaponry between\nattacker and victim, making the kill relatively cost-free. Rare in the animal kingdom are cases where\nattacker and victim are from the same species, both adults, and thus, comparable in size and weaponry.\nThis kind of killing ⎯⎯ call it adulticide ⎯⎯ only occurs in a small number of species, but the attacks are\nsufficiently frequent to count as part of the repertoire: ants, lions, wolves, chimpanzees and humans. The\nrarity of adulticide raises important questions about the evolutionary pressures that favored this upgrade\nto harming others, as well as the mechanisms that evolved to make it possible.\nBattles among ant colonies are notorious for their organized attacks, designed to kill the enemy\nand minimize costs. Watching ant colonies battle it out piques the imagination, recalling the classic face\noffs between British and French brigades, each side lined up in strategic formation, divided into ranks, set\nup to protect the land and royalty. In his book Life in the Woods, the American writer and nature lover\nHenry David Thoreau, writes that the ant battles were “deadly combat … without any noise… I never\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 38\nlearned which party was victorious, nor the cause of the war: but I felt for the rest of that day as if I had\nhad my feelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle, the ferocity and carnage, of a human\nbattle before my door.” What is distinctive about ant battles and the deaths that ensue is that they are\ncoordinated, with success driven by group size. As the biologist Eldridge Adams has demonstrated,\nbigger groups are more likely to win, more likely to kill a higher number of their smaller opponents, and\nless likely to incur any fatalities. Despite the similarities between ant and human battles, two differences\nundermine the usefulness of this analogy for understanding the evolution of lethal aggression in humans:\nants are only a very distant evolutionary cousin, subject to extremely different pressures of social life, and\ntheir cooperative efforts are largely among individuals who are virtual genetic clones. When humans go to\nbattle, cooperation is largely among unrelated individuals who are complete strangers. Of the small\nsample of species committing adulticide, chimpanzees are our best bet as they are closer evolutionary\ncousins and they join forces with kin and non-kin.\nTo get a sense of lethal aggression in chimpanzees, consider the following description by the\nanthropologist David Watts and his colleagues concerning an attack by males of the Ngogo community of\nUganda (emphasized words are mine):\n[Field Assistant] G. Mbabazi found 12 adult and three adolescent males, 10 of which had participated in\nthe boundary patrol 2 days before … in the eastern part of the Ngogo chimpanzees’ territory. They\nstarted another boundary patrol by quickly and quietly moving south and then east. At 0830 hr, they\nmoved east through a field of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), then reentered the forest and went\ntoward the spot where BT, LO, and MO [three adult male chimpanzees] had been displaying 1 day\nbefore and the area where Ngogo males had patrolled the day before that. As they reentered the forest,\nthe Ngogo chimpanzees met chimpanzees from another community. The neighboring chimpanzees were\nfeeding quietly on Pseudospondias microcarpa fruit in the same tree under which BT, LO, and MO had\ndisplayed. G. Mbabazi could not ascertain the precise number of chimpanzees from the neighboring\ngroup, but he saw at least two females with infants, one juvenile, and one adult male that immediately\nfled northeast with the Ngogo chimpanzees in pursuit. The Ngogo chimpanzees caught up to the strange\nadult male after chasing him for about 100 m and surrounded him. Adult Ngogo male EL began to\npummel the intruder, and adults BF, BRU, LO, and MO quickly joined him. The strange male tried to\nescape down a small hill but could not elude these five Ngogo males and others that joined them. The\nNgogo males, led by EL, continued to beat, bite, and kick him for 20 min, and dragged him farther\ndown this hill into a small stream valley about 50 m away from the spot of his initial capture, where he\ndied during or shortly after the attack. All of the Ngogo males remained in the area after the stranger\nwas killed. Several circled his body and some sniffed it, while others sat nearby. …Careful inspection\nshowed that the victim suffered wounds across his entire body … including a deep gash to the bone on\nthe left humerus and a deep puncture on the left side of the thorax near the heart. The only missing\nbody part was the victim’s testes, which were recovered 50 m away, near where he was initially captured\n(2006, p.g., 166).\nWatts’ description captures several important features of adulticide in chimpanzees ⎯⎯ both at the\nsame field site and others throughout Africa ⎯⎯ and in other species. The lethal attacks are explicitly\nproactive and planned. This is important because many cases of non-lethal aggression are reactive and\nimpulsive, and studies of human and nonhuman aggression reveal different brain mechanisms underlying\nthese two forms of violence. When chimpanzees attack, they use stealth to sneak up on the victim, and\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 39\nthen relentlessly hunt them down. When they catch the victim, the attack is brutal, focused on body parts\nthat are necessary for moving, communicating and reproducing. The attackers commonly have a\nnumerical advantage over the victims, a ratio of at least three to one. This power imbalance reduces the\ncosts of the attack by making it almost impossible for the victim to retaliate. Proof of this cost-benefit\nanalysis comes from the fact that the attacking party rarely incurs injuries, whereas the victims rarely\nescape alive. The benefit of these attacks is that the attacking community gains access to additional\nresources by weakening the competitive strength of their neighbors. In a well documented case from Jane\nGoodall’s site in Gombe, Tanzania, one chimpanzee community literally eliminated their competitors in\nthe neighboring community, absorbing the remaining individuals and land. Though such attacks are\ncertainly not a daily affair, they occur with sufficient frequency and benefits to create a selective\nadvantage for the winners.\nThe suite of behaviors that accompany coalitionary killing in chimpanzees has led several\nscientists, most notably Wrangham, to argue that this form of lethal aggression in chimpanzees is an\nadaptation, with deep parallels to human warfare. On this view, we inherited the upgrade to version 1.5\nlethal aggression.\nThe claim that our capacity for killing, especially in war, is an evolved adaptation, is anathema to\nmany, scholars in the humanities and social sciences. The visceral antagonism is triggered by the belief\nthat biological explanations imply inevitability, and provide an excuse for the atrocities we create. For\nthese scholars, war, and more generally, the high levels of killing observed among human populations, are\nrecent, cultural concoctions, born out of human intelligence, the invention of projectile weapons, and high\npopulation density, to name a few. From this perspective, biology plays no meaningful role in our\nunderstanding of human violence. From this perspective, killing in chimpanzees looks nothing like killing\nin humans. This attitude echoes the famous 1986 Seville Statement on violence in which a group of\ndistinguished scientists, including the ethologist Robert Hinde, the geneticist John Paul Scott, and the\nbiological anthropologist Richard Leakey, sidelined biology with the following five statements:\n1. \"It is scientifically incorrect to say that we have inherited a tendency to make\nwar from our animal ancestors.\"\n2. \"It is scientifically incorrect to say that war or any other violent behaviour is\ngenetically programmed into our human nature.\"\n3. \"It is scientifically incorrect to say that in the course of human evolution there\nhas been a selection for aggressive behaviour more than for other kinds of\nbehaviour.\"\n4. \"It is scientifically incorrect to say that humans have a 'violent brain'.\"\n5. \"It is scientifically incorrect to say that war is caused by 'instinct' or any single\nmotivation.\"\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 40\nThese claims led to the rather dreamy-eyed utopian conclusion that “Just as 'wars begin in the\nminds of men', peace also begins in our minds. The same species who invented war is capable of\ninventing peace. The responsibility lies with each of us.” In essence, understanding our biology will not\ncontribute to understanding violence and war because we invented war as well as peace, woven out of\nnurture’s cloth and her infinite tapestry of cultural potential. These kinds of claims about the role of\nbiology in human behavior are at best incoherent, and at worst plain wrong. They are also dangerous\nbecause they imply a view of human nature that is infinitely plastic, unconstrained by both universal\nfeatures of our biology, as well as individual differences that predispose some to extreme violence and\nothers to extreme altruism.\nWhat makes the Seville Statement, and other claims like it incoherent is a set of false attributions\nto biologists about the role of biology. Statements 2-5 are accurate in that it is incorrect to say that war or\nviolence are genetically programmed, subject to stronger selection than other kinds of behaviour, built\ninto the brain as a violent brain, and based on instinct with a single, inevitable output. But I don’t know\nany biologists who believe statements like these. The biologist Peter Marler famously spoke of singing in\nbirds as an instinct to learn, while the evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker described the Chomskyan\ninsight into language as the language instinct. A bird’s instinct to learn does not mean that there is a oneto-one,\ninflexible mapping between genes or brain circuits and a specific type of song. All songbirds have\nthe potential to acquire their species’ song, and in some birds, such as mockingbirds and parrots, this\ncapacity extends to acquiring the sounds of other animals and even inanimate sounds. But if there is no\ninput at all, or if the bird is deafened, the output is deficient in structure, unrecognizable as a speciesspecific\nsong. The same holds for the language instinct. Instincts are biological biases that constrain the\nrange of potential variation. Biology differentiates songbirds from birds that don’t learn their songs. This\nsame biology allows some birds to learn one song and use it for life, and allows other birds to acquire a\nvariety of different sounds for use in singing. The biology doesn’t determine the specific content of a\nsong. The content is determined by what the bird hears, constrained by what its bird brain and syrinx will\nprocess and reproduce. To a large extent, language is no different. Our biology allows us, but not any\nother species, to acquire language. This same biology sets up constraints, due in part to what our brains\ncan keep in memory, what our ears can hear, and what our larynx can produce. Like songbirds, the\nspecific content of what we say, whether with a French or Vietnamese accent, is determined by where we\nlive and who we listen to.\nIf there is any intelligible sense of genetically programmed or instinct, whether for violence,\nlanguage, sex, or mathematics, it is that our biology provides us with the capacity to acquire these\ndomains of knowledge and expression. This doesn’t mean that violence, language, sex or mathematics are\ninevitable or fixed in their expression. There are thousands of languages, ways of having sex, and forms\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 41\nof mathematical expression. There are also thousands of ways of being violent, and equally, ways of\ncounteracting such violence. But none of this takes away from the importance of biology, especially its\nrole in constraining the form that these expressions take in different environmental settings. To think\notherwise is just wrong.\nThe debate about version 1.5 of lethal aggression gains interest if we restrict the conversation to\nthe similarities and differences between chimpanzee and human killing. Similarities speak to our shared\nevolutionary history, including the mechanisms we inherited and the pressures that favored this form of\nviolence. Differences speak to both changes in our biology and the environments we confronted and\ncreated.\nThose who argue that the comparison between human and chimpanzee killing lacks any\nanalytical value come from two different camps. On the one hand are anthropologists such as Robert\nSussman and Brian Ferguson who suggest that chimpanzee killing is infrequent, has little benefit in terms\nof resources or competition, and is restricted to populations that are either artificially provisioned by\nhumans or crowded in by us. They also suggest that the archaeological evidence for human warfare\ndoesn’t really begin until about 12,000 years ago. As Ferguson notes “To argue that war is a result of\nsome sort of innate predisposition to wage it requires that war be practiced throughout our prehistoric\npast.” This date, so Ferguson continues, is too recent to invoke natural selection as a cause, and leaves\nunexplained why there is no earlier evidence of massive killing if our last common ancestors had this\ncapacity.\nThese criticisms either fly in the face of contradictory evidence or have little to do with the\noriginal ideas. Concerning chimpanzee killing, the evidence comes from multiple sites in East and West\nAfrica, including sites with no provisioning and no crowding from humans. Further, analyses by\nWrangham and his colleagues show that humans living as hunter-gatherers or subsistence farmers on the\ncontinents of Africa and South America, engage in coalitionary killing, using stealthy raids and\nimbalances of power to minimize the costs and maximize the benefits. Looking at 32 different small\nscale societies, calculations of the median death rate were between 164-595 per 100,000 per year.\nLooking at 9 chimpanzee communities spanning 5 populations in Tanzania, Uganda, and Ivory Coast, the\nrate was 69-287 per 100,000 per year. Chimpanzees fall well within the range of human hunter-gatherers\nand subsistence farmers. This evidence not only shows parallels between chimpanzees and human\nsocieties living under conditions most like our ancestors, but also provides a resounding rejection of the\nview that chimpanzee killing is infrequent and of trivial importance. If the rates of killing are comparable,\nthen either they are trivial for both species or trivial for neither. Given that both chimpanzees and human\nhunter-gatherers live in small groups, killing even a few individuals can have a dramatic effect on their\ncapacity to defend resources.\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 42\nA further parallel between chimpanzees and small scale human societies comes from analyses of\ntwo extreme warring societies, the Waorani of New Zealand and the Yanomamo of Venezuela. Though\nviolence accounts for between 40-55% of all deaths in these two groups, attackers appeared immune to\ninjury, with no more than 5% dying in battle, and often no deaths at all. Chimpanzee attackers are\nlikewise immune to injury, due in large part to the strategic use of imbalances of power.\nThe parallels between chimpanzees and humans living in small scale societies supports the idea\nthat similar pressures favored the capacity for coalitionary killing in both species. Does this mean that\neach of these species should always kill in this way, and thus, as argued by Ferguson, the archaeological\nrecord should be chock full of deaths by coalitionary attackers? To argue for this position is to\nmisunderstand the nature of an adaptation, and the arguments put forth by Wrangham as well as the\nevolutionary psychologists Martin Daly, Margo Wilson, and David Buss. As I discussed earlier on in this\nchapter, adaptations are contingent upon particular environmental circumstances. What is adaptive today\nneed not be tomorrow. This is why it is not only unsurprising to see variation in the frequency of\ncoalitionary killing among chimpanzee sites, among humans living in small scale societies, and among\nmodern day humans who sometimes kill their spouses, stepchildren, and rivals, but predicted by\nevolutionary theory. Adaptations are economically efficient solutions to particular social or ecological\nproblems. If those problems or pressures change, the original adaptation may have no impact on survival\nor a negative impact. A hiatus in the archaeological record ⎯⎯ assuming this is the last word ⎯⎯ is\ninteresting with respect to the conditions that might favor or select against coalitionary killing, but in no\nway undermines the logic of an evolutionary adaptation, one shared by chimpanzees and humans.\nThe second camp arguing against the parallels between humans and chimpanzees is defended by\nthe economist Samuel Bowles and his colleagues. Unlike the anthropologists, Bowles is entirely\nsympathetic to biology but sees fundamental differences in the pattern of human killing and warfare. To\nexplain these differences he invokes two important attributes of human societies that have only weak\nparallels in other species: large scale cooperation with unrelated others from the same group, together\nwith hatred, symbolic labeling, and the motivation to hurt all others outside the group. These two factors,\nwhat Bowles calls parochial altruism, may have paradoxically generated both greater levels of\ncooperation within groups and higher rates of warfare between groups. Those groups with the best\ncooperators acquired the greatest resources and experienced the fewest losses due to cheaters and other\nmorally corrosive rogues. This power and inward-looking favoritism led to self-defensive emotions and\nbehaviors, ultimately leading to lethal aggression toward those with different beliefs and values. Thus\nparochialism and altruism co-evolved, hand in hand, breeding prejudice as a result of group safety. This\nevolutionary handshake resulted in warfare and our unique capacity as killers.\nBowles’ analysis is interesting and consistent with my explanation of how we evolved the\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 43\ncapacity for evil. For both Bowles and I, certain aspects of our capacity to harm others emerges as an\nincidental byproduct of other capacities, and once this dynamic emerges, the combination of these\ncapacities can evolve and change. What Bowles’ analysis misses, however, is the fact that parochial\naltruism could well be true, and so too could our shared capacity for killing with chimpanzees. As noted\nabove, rates of killing among chimpanzees and several small scale societies are comparable, and so too\nare the costs and benefits to attackers and victims. This argues in favor of a shared history, and a shared\nadaptation. It does not mean that all aspects of killing in humans are similar, or that the human mind froze\nin a chimpanzee state with regard to its capacity to kill. It most definitely did not freeze.\nUnlike the lethal attacks by chimpanzees that are restricted to cases where groups attack lone\nvictims, primarily from neighboring groups, we wreak havoc on a massive scale, with one on one, many\nagainst many, and one against many, including victims within and outside our core group. Unlike\nchimpanzees, even our young children have an appetite for violence that can be nurtured, as evidenced by\nthe brutality of child soldiers around the globe. Unlike chimpanzees, individuals will sacrifice themselves\nfor an entire group as evidenced most recently by suicide bombers in the Middle East. Unlike\nchimpanzees, we derive great pleasure from watching others suffer, from watching violent movies, seeing\nother animals fight, and imagining the decimation of an enemy. Our minds also generate ideological\nreasons to motivate violence at extraordinary scales ⎯⎯ again, think of suicide bombers taking their lives\nfor a God, as well as the reward of an idyllic afterlife. And when our minds break down, or when we are\nafflicted with particular disorders early in life, we are capable of experiencing bizarre appetites for\nviolence, including the joy of eating the flesh of murdered victims, having intercourse with dead bodies,\nand asking for bondage and whippings to enhance sexual pleasure. These novel and unanticipated ways\nof harming others are the result of new hardware that has evolved only once in the history of this planet.\nHARMING OTHERS, version 2.0: requires Homo sapiens hardware\nWe depart from the pattern of adulticide seen in other animals because of our promiscuous brain. The\nidea is not that our brains evolved for killing in these unique ways, but rather, that our unique style of\nthinking led to novel ways of harming as an incidental consequence. The hardware that is our brain\nenabled new ways of harming others, building on specialized adaptations, some shared with other species\nand some uniquely human. The result is a brain that can develop a peculiar appetite for harming others.\nTo see how version 2.0 runs on our distinctively human hardware, let’s return to some of the core\nmicrocontrollers that I discussed a few sections back. Recall that there are hormones like testosterone\nthat surge when individuals win a competition, whether this involves the physical fighting of deer using\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 44\ntheir antlers, humans using their fists, or chess masters using their minds. Along with testosterone’s\nincrease is an increase in dopamine, a decrease in cortisol and serotonin, and a decrease in frontal lobe\nactivity and control. Within the environment of a promiscuous brain, this physiological ballet affects our\nsense of fairness, empathy, moral conscience, attitude toward retribution and justice, as well our\nwillingness to engage in lethal aggression.\nBrain imaging studies reveal that the prefrontal cortex plays an essential role in regulating our\naggressive instincts, when it’s working. When individuals respond aggressively to an unfair offer in a\nbargaining game, testosterone levels rise and activity decreases in a part of the prefrontal cortex\nassociated with self-control. Thus, testosterone’s effectiveness in human aggression is facilitated by a\nloss of control. Damage within this region of the brain causes abnormal aggressive responses to not only\ndirect insult, but even such trivial matters as being offered a lowish offer in the ultimatum game discussed\nearlier. Anatomical and functional abnormalities within this region of the frontal lobes are also associated\nwith aggressive pathology, such as psychopathology. There are also individual differences in aggressive\ntendencies among healthy people, due in part to differences in the patterns of activity between the right\nand left prefrontal cortices. Heightened activity on the left is associated with greater sensitivity to reward,\nlowered sensitivity to punishment, and considerably stronger aggressive responses to threatening stimuli,\nsuch as an angry face. This is not simply a correlation, as evidenced by studies that experimentally either\nsuppress or increase activity in one hemisphere compared with the other. For example, if you contract\nyour right hand you will increase activity in the left hemisphere of the brain; conversely, contracting the\nleft hand increases activity in the right hemisphere. Subjects contracting the right hand in an\nexperimental setting showed more aggressive responses to insult than did subjects contracting the left\nhand. The next time someone shakes a fist at you, check whether it is the right or left hand. If the person\nis from a different group and holds a fundamentally different suite of ideological beliefs, which hand is\nclenched is the least of your worries.\nFavoritism toward those who are like us, combined with hatred toward those who are not, is\ncommon in animals. As noted above, in-group favoritism or parochialism can lead to heightened levels of\ncooperation within groups, while simultaneously increasing the level of hostility towards those outside.\nOur promiscuous brain facilitated this co-evolutionary process, inviting the hormone oxytocin into the\nmix. Among mammals, including humans, oxytocin is released in females during labor and breastfeeding,\nand in both males and females during social bonding and parenting. This has led many to think of\noxytocin as the cuddle hormone or love drug. Floating within the human brain, oxytocin boosts trust in\ngames of cooperation, and greatly increases our ethnocentric biases. The Dutch psychologist Carsten De\nDreu and his colleagues ran a series of experiments that required male subjects to spray oxytocin or a\ncontrol up their noses. When oxytocin shoots up the nose, it goes straight to the brain. Relative to the\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 45\ncontrol group, those who sniffed oxytocin perceived in-group members as more likeable, more human,\nmore richly endowed with social emotions such as embarrassment, contempt, humiliation and admiration,\nand more worthy of saving in an emergency. Oxytocin increases our sense of camaraderie toward those\nwithin the inner sanctum, which can result in greater animosity toward those outside. Oxytocin may\ntherefore facilitate our ability to take out the competition even if this means killing another human being.\nOxytocin is two-faced, cuddling with its left profile and harming with its right.\nThis is a small sampling of the ways in which our promiscuous brain enables new forms of harm,\nincluding killing other adults. We didn’t invent lethal aggression. We share this capacity with a small\ngroup of animals that also kill other adults. But whereas these other species typically restrict their lethal\nattacks to situations in which one group greatly outnumbers another, typically targeting adults from a\nneighboring group, we evolved far beyond this monogamous approach. We adopted the cost-benefit\nanalysis that drives killing in other animals and applied it to killing in a virtually limitless space of\nhomicidal opportunities. We kill when we outnumber our opponents or are outnumbered by them,\nattacking individuals within and outside our core group. We kill spouses, ex-lovers, stepchildren, those\nwho believe in God and those who don’t, the wealthy and the poor, kin and non-kin, and even ourselves if\nthe cause is good enough. Virtually anything goes.\nOur promiscuous brains opened a Pandora’s box of harmful means, including the capacity to\naddress a multitude of injustices. This is a capacity that is inherently good, but incidentally bad. It is a\ncapacity that evolved in response to growing pressures to balance inequities and take care of those who\nattempt to cheat society. It is a capacity that enabled us to engage in punishment in a broad range of\ncontexts, righting wrongs and opening a new path to feeling good about harming others.\nIncidental justice\nCooperation is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, occurring in a wide range of situations.\nHumans are no exception. Like ants, humans also bring resources to their queen ⎯⎯ think England. Like\nscrub jays, humans work with extended family members to rear the next generation of offspring ⎯⎯ think\nMormons. Like dolphins, human males form super-coalitions to gain access to females ⎯⎯ think the\nYanomami Indians of South America, where men raid neighboring villages to take their women. And like\nchimpanzees, humans cooperate to monitor their borders, often capturing and killing intruders ⎯⎯ think\nPalestine and Israel. But human cooperation is distinctive in two ways: we frequently cooperate with\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 46\nlarge numbers of genetically unrelated strangers, and punish those who cheat by free-riding on others’\ngood will.\nThe challenge to any cooperative enterprise is to avoid getting suckered by free-riders who cheat\nand add little or no help. As group size grows, the opportunity to cheat and get away with it grows as\nwell given the challenges of storing information about reputation. How do individuals and groups avoid\nthis sucker problem?\nWhen nonhuman animals cooperate with members of the same species, they typically target kin.\nHelping kin provides a buffer against the sucker’s costs because investing in kin means investing in\ngenetic posterity. Helping relatives, even at a cost, translates to helping ones genes move on into the next\ngeneration ⎯⎯ an insight developed by the British evolutionary biologist William D. Hamilton. When\ncooperation involves unrelated others, nonhuman animals attempt to circumvent the sucker’s problem by\nworking with a small number of familiar others whose reputation is known, targeting contexts where all\nparticipants benefit more from working cooperatively than working alone. These mutual benefits help\noffset the costs of cooperation.\nBy restricting cooperation to relatives or small numbers of unrelated but familiar group members,\nanimal societies have buffered themselves from extreme cheating. This is significant because cheaters\narise in a variety of contexts where there are rules of engagement, including both cooperative and noncooperative\nsituations. For example, both lions and chimpanzees cooperate in group defense against\ndangerous neighbors. Some individuals cheat by lagging behind, or failing to join in altogether. In\nsocieties organized around hierarchies, low ranking animals sometimes cheat by attempting to eat more\nthan their fare share or by reproducing when their societal norms explicitly forbid it. Interestingly,\ncheaters in cooperative situations such as those in lions and chimpanzees, never suffer any adverse\nconsequences from the dominants. In contrast, cheaters in competitive situations such as those that arise\nin hierarchical societies, are punished. Nonhuman animals thus have the capacity to recognize and\nchange rule breakers. And yet, these capacities are not applied in the context of cooperative interactions.\nMonogamous thinking rules.\nWhen it comes to enforcing fairness in cooperation, the fundamental barrier for animals lies with\nthe economics of punishment. Punishment is costly. When a cheater is detected and attacked, there is\nalways the possibility that he will retaliate. Cheaters, even when caught, need not surrender without a\nfight. Punishment therefore requires the capacity to surmount an immediate cost, while recognizing the\npossibility that any benefit could be greatly delayed. For example, lashing out against a lion laggard or a\nchimpanzee cheater might cause each to join in on future cooperative ventures, but this is a delayed\nbenefit, and it may never materialize. This adds another potential opportunity cost. As Shakespeare so\ndeftly noted “Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends.”\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 47\nWaiting for a future benefit, whatever its currency, is hard for all animals, humans included.\nStudies of rats, birds, monkeys, apes, human children and adults show that individuals perceive future\ngains as less valuable than immediate, but smaller gains. For example, give any one of these animals a\nchoice between one piece of food and ten, and they will pick the ten. More is better than less, except if\nyou are a dieting human. Now give them a choice between one piece available immediately and ten pieces\navailable after some delay. Virtually every animal shifts to the one piece, with the only comparative\ndifference linked to the length of the delay ⎯⎯ a few seconds for rats, birds, most monkeys, young\nchildren, and adults with frontal lobe damage, a few minutes for some apes, older children and some\nadults. Everyone is, to some extent, pulled by the hedonistic now. The future loses its luster when a tasty\nalternative is just within reach. This is in part due to the uncertainty associated with the future, and in\npart, the sheer temptation to take what is in front of us.\nUnique evolutionary changes in the human brain allowed us to exert much greater patience,\noverriding the pull of the hedonistic now. These changes didn’t evolve for punishment, but they were\nreadily deployed by this system of justice. We rely on creative strategies to place value on the future,\nincluding putting resources away so that we can’t use them ⎯⎯ think savings accounts ⎯⎯ and making\nverbal commitments that bind us to the future ⎯⎯ think about the social embarrassment of failing in front\nof friends. These strategies help diminish the emotional pull of taking what is immediately available,\nallowing future benefits to gain in attractiveness. This is a brain that can wait for the delayed benefits of\npunishment.\nThe brain changes that facilitated our capacity to delay gratification were accompanied by others\nthat further offset the costs of punishment: our brains reward us with a feel-good feeling when we pay the\ncosts of punishment. For the first time in evolutionary history, the physical and psychological costs of\npunishment were at least partially offset by the pleasure of justice served, whether delivered directly or\nwitnessed from afar.\nWhen we punish or get even with those who have acted badly, we feel a hedonic high, an\nexperience captured by the metaphor “revenge is sweet but not fattening.” As demonstrated by the\neconomist Ernst Fehr, this is more than a metaphor. When we hand someone his just deserts, punishing\nsomeone for cheating, lying, or breaking a promise, our brain responds as if we handed ourselves just\ndesserts, activating brain circuitry associated with reward. In one study, two subjects played a monetary\nexchange game in which one player ⎯⎯ the donor ⎯⎯ decided how much of a pot of money to give to\nanother. A third player observed, out of view, the outcome of the exchange. In some cases, observers\nwitnessed a fair division of the money and in other cases, an unfair division in which the donor kept a\ndisproportionate amount of the total. The observer then faced a difficult decision: leave the two players\nwith their take-home earnings or use personal funds to take away money from the donor, returning it to\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 48\nthe bank. Taking money away from the donor is a form of costly punishment. It is costly in two ways: the\npunisher loses money he could have kept, and the donor loses money that he unfairly kept in his previous\nexchange.\nWhen donors kept a significantly larger portion of the original sum, observers punished, paying\nthe costs. They also reported feeling good about taking down the cheapskates. Where was this honey hit\nto the brain coming from?\nTo figure this out, Fehr and his colleagues put people in a brain scanner and used a technique\ncalled Positron Emission Tomography or PET. This type of scanning provides a picture of how much\nglucose is used up by different brain areas during a task. Higher glucose consumption occurs when there\nis higher activity in a brain region. When punishers decided to punish a selfish donor, glucose\nconsumption increased in a region of the brain associated with reward: the dorsal striatum. This region is\nalso active when you eat ice cream, earn money, and solve an unexpected problem. Punishers incurred a\nfinancial cost, but gained emotional elation and internal reward. It turns out that giving someone his just\ndeserts feels like eating dessert, but without the caloric gain.\nWhen distinctively promiscuous punishment evolved, it transformed our capacity to cooperate\nand to maintain conformity to social norms. It provided us with the tools to not only repair a puncture in\nthe system of norms, but to feel good about the costs personally incurred. When we punish, we have\nserved justice and served ourselves a helping of the brain’s rewards. The fossil record doesn’t capture\nwhen we evolved the capacity to punish, as skulls and bones, stone tools, and even paintings are silent on\nwhy someone received a spear through the head ⎯⎯ perhaps punished for a wrong doing or perhaps an\nenemy, a competitor interested in the same resources, or a suspected lover. No one will ever know. What\nwe do know is that other primates never punish cheaters who break the norms of cooperation, whereas\nhunter-gatherers dotting the continents do. Though people living today as hunter-gatherers are not perfect\nreplicas of what life was like way back when, they indicate that before we had sophisticated technology,\nagriculture, and permanent residences, we had the capacity to minimize the costs of the sucker’s problem.\nWhenever this capacity emerged in human evolution, it provided a critical part of the solution to the\nproblem of large-scale cooperation among unrelated strangers. With many eyes on the look out for\ncheaters, and a capacity to take out or ostracize the free riders, cooperation emerged as a stable solution to\nproblems that are unsolvable at an individual level, including group defense and the acquisition of costly\nresources. Punishment enabled humans to live in large, stable cooperative societies, many of whom are\nunrelated strangers.\nThis momentous event in the history of cooperation carried with it a serious cost, bringing\naggression and reward into closer proximity, with the costs of attacking others overshadowed by the\nbenefits. As I discuss in greater detail in the next chapter, this economic transformation created, as an\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 49\nincidental consequence, a hunger to watch violence and to see it as entertainment. It allowed our feelings\nof inequity and envy to morph into schadenfreude, retaliation, and spite. It allowed us to enjoy violence\nas perpetrators and spectators. It allowed us to put our money on feeling good about righting an injustice.\nWhy oh why?\nWhy did evil, expressed as excessive harm to innocent others, evolve? The answer lies, so I suggest, in a\nspecial property of the human brain. Some time after we diverged from a chimpanzee-like common\nancestor, the human brain was remodeled to allow promiscuous connections between previously\nunconnected circuits. Promiscuity enabled us to explore new problems using a combination of older, but\nnonetheless adaptive parts. Some of these novel explorations led to highly adaptive consequences, as\nwhen we developed the ability to self-deceive in the service of pumping ourselves up to do better in the\ncontext of competition; or when we invented new technologies to solve difficult environmental problems,\nsuch as using spears to capture prey at a distance; or, when we acquired the know-how to stockpile and\nenhance resources such as food, water and fertile land that are critical to individual survival and\nreproduction; or when we evolved the richly textured social emotions of jealousy, shame, guilt, elation,\nand empathy, feelings that motivate individuals to recognize the importance of others’ well-being and\ninterests and to correct prior wrongs; or, when we tapped into the rich connection between reward and\naggression to punish cheaters trying to destabilize a cooperative society. But these same adaptive\nexplorations also resulted in incidental costs that have destroyed the lives of innocent individuals. The\ncapacity to deny others’ moral worth enabled us to justify great harms, including self-sacrifice as living\nbombs designed to annihilate thousands of non-believers. The capacity to create advanced weaponry\nenabled us to kill at a distance, thereby avoiding the aversiveness of taking out those staring back. The\ncapacity to stockpile resources led to the growth of greed, increasing disparities among members of\nsociety, the inspiration to steal, and heightened violence both to defend and to obtain. The capacity to\nexperience social emotions such as jealousy led to blind rage and a driving engine of homicide, including\ncuckolded lovers who kill their spouses and stepparents who kill their stepchildren. The capacity to feel\ngood about harming others enabled us to recruit this elixir in the service of causing excessive harm in any\nnumber of novel contexts, from ethnic cleansings to bizarre fetishes that include self-mutilation. And the\nlist goes on. This is the yin and yang of promiscuous thinking. This is the natural history of evil, its\nancestry and adaptive significance. This evolutionary explanation sets the stage for unpacking the recipe\nfor evil, how it develops within individuals and societies, ingredient by ingredient.\nHauser Chapter 1.

Nature’s secrets 54\nChapter 2:\nRunaway desire\nThe desire of being believed, or the desire of persuading, of leading and\ndirecting other people, seems to be one of the strongest of all of our desires.\n⎯⎯ Adam Smith\nIn 1999, an investment officer in a management firm had a gut feeling that something was wrong in a\ncorner of the securities market. Based on calculations from the stated investment strategy for the fund, the\nreturns were not only orbiting outside the financial stratosphere, but were mathematically impossible. The\nofficer contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission, outlined the problem, and asked them to look\ninto it. No reply. Year after year, the officer continued to contact the SEC about this case, explaining that\nit was potentially lethal, that he had no personal investments in the fund, and had never been an\nemployee. No reply. Then, in 2007, he sent the SEC a 17-page report, showing why there was only one\nplausible conclusion: the stated strategy for the fund was a fraudulent cover up for a massive moneymaking\nscheme. Eventually, in 2008, the brains behind this scheme was ousted, escorted to a life in prison\nas number 61727-054, and welcomed to his new home by a community of like-minded white-collar\ncriminals.\nMeet HARRY MARKOPOLOS ⎯⎯ the investment officer ⎯⎯ MADOFF SECURITIES ⎯⎯ the seductive\ninvestment opportunity ⎯⎯ and BERNARD MADOFF ⎯⎯ the genius behind one of the most spectacular\nPonzi schemes in recorded history. Whistleblowers started warning the SEC as early as 1992, but no one\nlistened. Madoff was making money hand over fist by pocketing new investments and if needed, using\nsome of these to pay off individuals wishing to redeem their funds. Ponzi schemes work as long as new\ninvestments exceed the number of investors wishing to redeem their own investments. And for Madoff,\nthis balancing act worked for 16 years. Then, as in the Bible’s Book of Joshua, the walls came tumbling\ndown, with Jericho riding in to hand Madoff a 150-year prison term for the financial murder of his\ntrusting clients. Altogether, these innocent and trusting people lost approximately $65 billion dollars, all\nbecause one man allowed his desire for wealth and power to run out of control. Or so it seemed.\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 55\nWere those who put their money in Madoff securities entirely innocent? Or, like Madoff, did\nthey too allow their desire for more wealth to run wild? Was Madoff’s desire for extreme wealth that far\noff the curve of human variation? And if he was off, who or what do we blame? Could some quirky\nfeature of Madoff’s genome, together with the brain states it orchestrates, have pushed him over the edge\ninto a universe of unreasonable and even irrational desires? Does it matter that Madoff grew up in a world\nin which the rich get richer despite the direct or indirect harm caused to innocent others?\nMany have speculated answers to these questions, based on little or no evidence, and certainly no\nscientific evidence. But what matters most about case studies such as this is that they raise the kinds of\nquestions that science can answer. What matters is that it is possible to run a Ponzi scheme. It is possible\nbecause there are humans like Madoff who are driven by the desire to accumulate great wealth, despite\nthe personal risks and costs to others. It is possible because the world is populated by people who are\nwilling to throw critical reasoning to the wind in the face of a tempting offer to make a huge amount of\nmoney. It is possible because people will take risks either without considering the potentially horrific\nconsequences to innocent others, or by trivializing them.\nAs far as we know, Madoff never intended to put his friends and family members in a state of\nfinancial ruin. As far as we know, many invested in his securities knowing that investments can fail. As\nfar as we know, some must have been suspicious, at least for a while, about how their investments could\nconsistently yield such over the top returns when nothing else has or seemingly could. Madoff is certainly\nto blame for creating a fraudulent investment opportunity, but so too are the many who trusted him\nwithout question, happy to make absurdly high returns.\nDid Madoff cause excessive harm? Yes. Were those harmed innocent victims? Not entirely.\nNone were forced to invest, and all invested with at least some knowledge that the promised returns were\noff the charts. This is not innocence. This is desire run amuck while self-control and reason fly standby.\nMadoff was morally wrong, but not evil, at least not on my accounting of the ingredients of evil.\nMadoff’s case illustrates the power of desire to stampede reason. As the essayist James Thurber\nremarked, “Love is blind, but desire just doesn’t give a good goddamn.” Madoff didn’t give a good\ngoddamn. How does a system like this get going, and then sometimes go wrong, very wrong? It all starts\nwith the elements of pleasure.\nP for pleasure\nImagine that scientists have just announced the discovery of a center in the brain that manages our\nexperience of pleasure. Imagine further that they have invented a consumer device that, for only $49.99,\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 56\nenables you to ramp up or down the activity in the pleasure center. Want to get a bit more out of your\ndinner, a movie, tennis stroke, work, or sex? Flip the switch. Want to buffer yourself from the pain of\nostracism, a romantic break up, or a colonoscopy? Flip the switch. Would you buy it? If so, what would\nyou use it for, and would you be a habitual user? Would you worry about any side effects? Might using\nthis device become addictive, or worse, either destroy the feeling of pleasure altogether or push you into a\nnever-ending quest for satisfaction, with each dollop of pleasure leaving you wanting a bigger dollop next\ntime around. This may seem like science fiction, but it’s closer to non-fiction.\nOver fifty years ago, scientists working with rats, implanted electrodes into in a region of the\nbrain called the nucleus accumbens. The electrodes were connected to a switch. If the rat pressed the\nswitch, it activated the electrode and thus stimulated this brain area. The rats indeed pressed, over and\nover again, some at a rate of 2000 presses per hour, with no external reward or threat of punishment.\nPressing the switch was the reward, or at least the vehicle to what appeared to be the experience of\nreward. Pressing the switch was addictive. These scientists had discovered a critical part of the circuitry\nof pleasure, in rats! The rats discovered a pleasure switch, something they wanted to experience over and\nover and over again.\nSoon after this discovery, clinicians started using deep brain stimulation to treat individuals with\nneurological complications, including Parkinson’s patients suffering from loss of motor control, patients\nexperiencing sustained pain, Tourette’s patients suffering from motor tics and obsessive-compulsive\nproblems, and even a patient in a coma who had lost, but then slowly recovered the capacity to name and\ngrasp objects. Similar to the rat work, the technique involves implanting an electrical pulse generator\nwithin a targeted brain region. When the generator is turned on, it stimulates activity in previously\nmalfunctioning regions. But as with genetic manipulations and the unknown space that characterizes the\ngenomic universe, so too is the situation unchartered in the neuronal universe. Two patients suffering\nfrom chronic pain were implanted with impulse generators and subsequently developed profound\naddictions to the stimulation. In addition to relatively successful pain reduction, both patients experienced\nan enhanced desire for sex, including erotic feelings. One of these patients self-stimulated so often that\nshe forgot to wash, change clothes, and adhere to family commitments. What happened? Did the\nclinicians treating these patients hit the pleasure center? When stimulated, what actually changed in the\nminds of these patients? Did they simply want more sexual arousal, suggesting that stimulation turned up\nthe gain on their desire for sex? Or, did stimulation change what they like, a shift in the sense of pleasure\nthat accompanies sex, and in this case, the anticipation of sex? Or perhaps it changed both wanting and\nliking, especially since we often want things we like?\nThese observations of how humans and rats respond to brain stimulation show that particular\nareas of the brain are linked to pleasure, especially the motivation to obtain rewarding experiences. These\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 57\nobservations also reveal that when these areas are activated, they can result in addictive, uncontrollable\nbehaviors that are toxic to self and others. They suggest that areas of the brain associated with desire can\nrun out of control. But to understand how the brain motivates us to want some things but not others, how\nit creates the experience of liking, and how it enables us to want things we like by learning about the\nworld, we must turn to experiments on nonhuman animals, brain scans of healthy humans, the mechanics\nof mind-altering drugs, conscious and unconscious influences on our choices, and the sad stories of\nindividuals with uncontrollable urges to eat, drink, snort, shoot up, and gamble. This is the evidence that\nscientists, especially the American cognitive neuroscientist Kent Berridge, have gathered to explain the\nthree core elements of pleasure: wanting, liking, and learning.\nOften, but not always, the experiences we want or desire are the experiences we like. Often, but\nnot always, the experiences we like are rewarding and good for our health. Often, but not always, we are\naware of the experiences we like, and make rational plans to experience them again. Often, but not\nalways, our rational plans to experience what we like makes us happy. Often, but not always, we find\nways to maintain our happiness by using self-control to moderate our exposure to pleasurable\nexperiences. The often refrain refers to the fact that the systems involved in wanting, liking, and learning\nwork in this way most of the time. The but not always refrain is a tip off to exceptions that speak to\ninteresting aspects of the machinery. For example, though we most often want things we like, we can\nwant things we don’t like and like things we don’t want. I want to lift weights, do push-ups and sit-ups to\nstay fit, but I don’t really like doing any of these exercises. I like the Porsche Boxster sportscar, but don’t\nwant one because it is a gas guzzling environmental nightmare and inconveniently small for a family car.\nThe fact that wanting and liking can mount a unified front or conflict with each other shows that it is\nimportant to look at the glue between them, which is learning. Learning allows us to work out our values,\nsetting up a preference profile for what we desire in the people we interact with, the places we visit, the\nobjects we handle, and the events we experience. Learning allows us to predict situations that generate\npleasure or pain. Though we are conscious of many of these processes, and can actively influence them,\nunconscious processes are also at work. These systems of the brain link us to our evolutionary past, and to\nanimals without language but clearly expressed likes and dislikes.\nEvolution has endowed all animals with unconscious wanting systems ⎯⎯ brain circuitry that\nmotivates individuals to seek resources that enable survival and reproduction. For young mammals, still\ndependent upon parental care, their desires are simple: milk and warmth from their mothers, and\ndepending on the species, additional warmth and protection from fathers; for the record, the human father\nis an oddity among primates, as no other ape and virtually no other monkeys express a paternal instinct.\nWith growth and independence, desires shift to other resources that can satisfy hunger and thirst,\naccompanied by sexual and social status desires. Though driven by unconscious operations, the behaviors\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 58\nthat result are often strategic, dependent upon changes in climate, other competitors, who happens to be in\na bad mood, and who is sexually active. In a variety of species, from dung beetles to deer, biologists have\ndeveloped mathematical models that accurately predict how long an individual should wait for a sexual\npartner or feed in a food patch. The accuracy of these models shows that individuals’ desires for resources\nlinked to survival and reproduction are captured by lawful principles or rules. This is important because it\nmeans we understand how the machine underlying behavior works. It means we understand how animals\nmake certain choices.\nUnderstanding how wanting works is straightforward. In both humans and nonhuman animals,\nwe can measure what individuals approach when we give them a choice, as well as how much effort they\nare willing to exert while approaching and gaining access to a particular object or experience. For\nexample, in studies that explore whether captive animals are provided with sufficient housing conditions,\nan experimenter presents individuals with a choice of rooms, one consisting of the typical housing\nenvironment and the others by the addition of goods believed to be of interest. To enter a given room\nrequires opening a door. To determine how much an individual really wants what is in another room, the\nexperimenter ramped up the difficulty of opening each door. In studies of captive hens and mongoose,\nindividuals exerted considerable effort to open some doors but not others. Hens rammed into doors\nopening onto a chipped wood floor, whereas mongoose did the same for a pool of water. These are items\nthey want, but do not get in captivity.\nWhat about liking? It may seem, at first blush, that because liking is a subjective experience, that\nthere are no clear objective ways to measure it. My likes are my own. You can’t possibly know what it\nis like to be me. If you can’t know what it is like to be me, then we can’t possibly know what it is like to\nbe a mongoose, mouse or monkey. There are, however, ways of measuring liking and disliking that are\nreliable, objective, and consistent across species. In many animals, including human babies who can’t\nspeak and human adults who have lost this capacity due to brain injury, there are distinctive behaviors\nthat are consistently linked to positive experiences and others linked to negative ones. For example, in\nmice, monkeys, and human babies, tasting something sweet like sugar causes a lot of lip licking, whereas\ntasting something bitter such as quinine causes mouth gaping, nose twitching, and arm flailing. These\nsimilarities show that evolution has been conservative, maintaining the same underlying mechanisms for\nhandling likes and dislikes. These similarities have enabled scientists to understand how the brain systems\ninvolved in wanting and liking can change together or separately, even though they can’t help us\nunderstand the harder problem of what, in particular, it is like for a given mouse, monkey or man to like\nsomething.\nTo understand the machinery that drives rodent wants or desire, Susana Peciña and Kent Berridge\ntook advantage of the genetic technique that Joe Tsien ⎯⎯mentioned in the last chapter ⎯⎯ used to create\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 59\nsmart mice. Recall that Tsien jazzed up a gene’s expression to improve memory and learning. In\ncontrast, Peciña and Berridge quieted a gene that controls the amount of dopamine floating around in\nbetween neurons. With this gene silenced, dopamine levels increased. Compared with normal mice, these\ndopamine-plus mice consumed twice as much food and water, and learned much faster where food was\nlocated within a maze. But when it came to measuring licking as liking, the dopamine-plus mice were no\ndifferent from normal mice. Dopamine is therefore essential for the wanting system, but not the liking\nsystem. This conclusion has been supported by many other studies, of mice and men, in the context of\neating and drug addiction ⎯⎯ two topics that I will shortly revisit.\nTo understand what rodents like, Peciña and Berridge injected an opioid drug ⎯⎯ similar to opium\nfrom poppy plants ⎯⎯ into two brain regions associated with reward ⎯⎯ the nucleus accumbens and the\nventral pallidum. Not only have studies of rodents, monkeys, and humans revealed that these areas are\nassociated with reward ⎯⎯ recall the brain stimulation studies ⎯⎯ but they contain sub-regions known as\nhedonic hotspots ⎯⎯ zones tuned to particular kinds of stimulation, designed to jazz up the liking element\nof pleasure. Following injection, individuals licked four times more often in response to sugar as the noninjected\nindividuals, but did not show a difference in wanting. The opioid injections also caused a\ndecrease in the aversiveness of bitter quinine, as evidenced by a decrease in mouth gaping. Turning on\nthese hedonic hotspot ramped up the pleasure of sweets, and diminished the displeasure from bitters.\nTogether, the Pecina and Berridge studies highlight the independence of wanting and liking, and the ways\nin which the brain ⎯⎯ or a clever experimenter playing with it ⎯⎯ regulates the elements of pleasure.\nHow does the brain figure out what’s hot and what’s not, delicious or disgusting? It’s one thing\nto desire a particular experience, and another to derive pleasure from the experience. But the world is not\nset up with labels that indicate which objects and events are pleasurable and which distasteful. Every\nobject and event has particular properties that, depending on the animal’s sensory ability, can be seen,\nheard, tasted, smelled, or touched. For all organisms, there are receptors within each of the sensory\nmodalities that are biased to prefer some things over others. This is why no human baby has to be taught\nto dislike bitter things and like sweet things. From the very first encounter, sugary solutions trigger\ntongue protrusions and licking, whereas bitter solutions trigger a gaping mouth. We have evolved, as have\nother animals, sensory systems that are tuned to prefer some things and dislike others, right from the start.\nThese initial biases guide the learning process, facilitating acquisition of new knowledge in some cases,\nmaking it almost impossible in others, and setting a course to self-destruction in yet others. Try teaching\na young child that the taste of sweet chocolate is disgusting while the taste of bitter endives is delicious.\nTry teaching cocaine addicts to turn off the magnetic pull of white powder, or convincing alcoholics that\nthe clinking sound of ice in a glass isn’t meaningful. Try teaching rogue soldiers involved in genocide\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 60\nthat the parasitic enemy shouldn’t be exterminated. This is where scientific explanation gains\nconsiderable interest, helping us understand how we develop anticipatory pleasures and past-oriented\nregrets, struggle to change from habitual rewards, and acquire irrational desires for experiences we no\nlonger enjoy ⎯⎯ a problem that appears to maintain most forms of addiction.\nHumans go to restaurants and bees to flowers because both are associated with food. Within these\nbroad categories, there are good restaurants and flowers, as well as bad ones, where good and bad are\ndetermined by experience. The experience can be direct, as when food is actually consumed, or indirect\nas when humans listen to an animated friend describe a restaurant’s menu and bees watch a hive mate\ndance, providing a description of the flower’s location and quality. Once the association between food\nand location is established, simply seeing the restaurant or flower triggers a cascade of neural and\nchemical activity in the brain linked to reward and the anticipation of pleasure. The restaurant and\nflower are cues that predict food. If you walked into your favorite restaurant and found that they sold\nfertilizer rather than food, you would be heartbroken. If you haven’t been to the restaurant in a long time,\nbut memorialized your previous experience as a gastronomic high, you will be deeply disappointed if\nyour first bite doesn’t live up to the standards you anticipated. This mismatch between anticipated and\nexperienced reward will lead to a cascade of brain activity ⎯⎯ indicative of an error. The primary engine\ndriving the experience of reward, including predicting when it will occur and with what kind of intensity,\nis the dopaminergic system, a network of brain areas that releases dopamine in most invertebrates and\nvertebrates, including the human vertebrate.\nMany natural behaviors trigger dopamine, including male songbirds singing to attract females,\nrhesus monkeys seeing a red light that has been associated with a soon to be delivered shot of juice, and\nhumans cooperating with each other. Many unnatural behaviors and objects can also trigger dopamine.\nAnimals trained to press a switch for food, will often become obsessively attracted to the switch,\ncaressing and biting it even in the absence of food; humans with addictions to cigarettes, food and\ngambling, will often obsessively fondle an empty cigarette carton, fork, and deck of cards, respectively.\nBut these correlations leave open the question of whether dopamine causes the anticipation or experience\nof reward, or flows from these experiences.\nTo tackle the causality problem requires experiments, either directly changing dopamine\nconcentration or comparing individuals who, due to genetic differences, show differences in dopamine\nlevels. We know from studies of rodents and monkeys that selectively increasing dopamine with drugs\nresults in heightened wanting of food if there are cues to foraging, or sex if opportunity knocks. The\nIsraelian cognitive neuroscientist Tali Sharot pursued a similar approach with healthy humans subjects.\nShe first asked individuals to rate how happy they would be if they vacationed in 80 possible destinations.\nThen, some subjects took a placebo while others took L-dopa, a drug that selectively increases the release\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 61\nof dopamine. Later, these same subjects imagined what it would be like to actually vacation in these\nplaces, and rated their imagined experience. Those on L-dopa felt they would be much happier, revealing\nthe power of dopamine to cause changes in our experience of reward. Complimenting these experimental\nresults are studies showing that genetic variation in the expression of dopamine in humans are closely tied\nto impulsive behaviors and behavioral disorders. Thus, individuals with genetic variants that result in\nhigher levels of dopamine are more likely to engage in compulsive gambling and eating, leading to\naddictions. The anticipation of heightened pleasure leads these gamblers, eaters, and abusers to want\nmore and more.\nThis work shows that dopamine is necessary for monitoring and guiding our desire for reward,\nwith evidence of individual differences that start with our biology. This is a highly adaptive system. But\nchanges in dopamine can also cause our desire for reward to runaway, like a brakeless trolley. This is a\nhighly maladaptive process. This flip between adaptive and maladaptive that we see within the\ndopaminergic system is, by now, a familiar brain routine. It provides, I believe, the means to explain all\nmanners of excess, from the desire for food and money to drugs and violence.\nObesity and drug addiction are disorders of excess. They are disorders of insatiable desire. There\nare many paths to obesity and addiction, but all ultimately point to changes in the reward system. In\nhumans born with deficient levels of the hormone leptin, overeating and obesity are common outcomes.\nWhen these individuals view images of food during a brain scanning session, they show lower levels of\nactivity in the striatum than non-leptin deficient individuals. The striatum is an area that is rich in\ndopamine and an essential part of the reward system. This may, at first, seem paradoxical: how could\nthose who eat to excess not show an excess of activity in the striatum, and thus, an over-the-top\nexperience of reward upon seeing food? The answer lies in studies of rodents and humans. Whether it is\nobese rats or obese people, both show compulsive eating, but lower levels of expression of dopamine in\nthe striatum. If you silence a key dopamine gene in rats, you can quickly turn them into food junkies,\ndriven by an unsatisfied wanting system. Overeating, like over-drugging, turns the reward dial down.\nThis is an adaptive response, except when it operates in the mind of a food or drug junky. Though the\nreward hits are small and unnoticeable, the wanting system remains highly motivated, triggered by the\nsame cues. What food and drug junkies want is more hits, but the reward system isn’t delivering. This\ncauses them to want even more.\nWhat the work on obesity and addiction tell us is that independently of how people get started on\nthe path to fulfilling their desires, and whatever leads them to over-consume, consumption loses its luster.\nThe brain is smart: excess is bad and thus the reward systems turns off. But because the wanting or desire\nsystem is independent from the reward system, and has evolved insurance against a complete shut down,\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 62\nit continues to drive desire. Because the reward system isn’t delivering the goods, excess unfolds driven\nby a wanting system that is looking for pleasure in all the wrong places.\nWhen we were hunters and gatherers, excess was an unborn concept. We lived on the edge then,\nenjoying scraps of whatever kill arrived on the fireplace, together with the tubers gathered up on the day.\nWe, at least many of us in the West, live in a world that has a 24/7 cafeteria of food and drugs. It is a want\nit-have it culture. As work in molecular biology shows, and as I will pick up in chapter 4, some of us start\noff more vulnerable than others, susceptible to sampling from the cafeteria at all hours of the day and\nnight. The combination of a heavily marketed environment and a biological susceptibility to excess, is a\nlosing combination for the consumer.\nThe work on addiction provides a template for thinking about how individuals and societies ignite\na path to excessive harms. In the same way that excessive eating gets going and going out of control\nwhen the dopamine system drives an irrational desire to want more and more food that is liked less and\nless, so too is excessive harm often driven by a similar decoupling between wants and likes. Individuals\nstart with a desire to acquire wealth, to physically harm those who are unlike them, or taste the sweetness\nof revenge against someone who acted unfairly. These desires are often linked to an experience of\npleasure or the anticipation of pleasure. But as such actions and their consequences accumulate, the\npleasure derived diminishes, as money is acquired just for the sake of having more, while individuals are\ninjured, maimed, or killed because this is the policy that must be pursued. Liking is no longer part of the\nequation, leaving cold desire to do its work at the expense of innocent others who get in the way.\nTo develop this idea, and especially the link to excessive harm, I have to fill in a missing piece in\nour discussion of desire. Everything I have discussed in this section has focused on individuals and their\ncore corporal needs for survival ⎯⎯ or in the case of drugs, recreation. I haven’t said a word about how\ndesire works in the social arena, whether the same systems are in play when we compare our own desires\nand resources with others, or with other opportunities. When desire is motivated by what others have or\nhave achieved, are the same processes in play as when we eat, drink, or gamble? These are important\nquestions as the desire to accumulate great wealth or to harm others is often motivated by comparison\nshopping, assessing what others have relative to our own status. The most primal starting point for\ncomparison shopping is the world of hierarchies, a world where the desire to dominate rules.\nPower hungry\nWhether you are observing a social insect, fish, lizard, bird, rat, whale, monkey, or human, males are\nbigger and bolder, more boisterous, brash and brazen, and more motivated to get into a brawl than\nfemales. Though biologists don’t define the sexes based on these differences, they use them to understand\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 63\nwhat drives competition for valuable resources and what determines the criteria for dominance status.\nBiologists define the sexes based on differences in the gonads, the reproductive organs that generate eggs\nand sperm, and the corresponding effects of sex-specific selection on the mind, body, and behavior.\nFemales are those with larger, more costly gonads, where cost is defined on the basis of how much energy\nis invested in production. Think eggs versus sperm. This difference sets up an immediate competition,\nespecially for species that have parental care. Once you invest in a big expensive egg, you don’t want to\nlose your investment. You want to protect it, avoiding harm and minimizing risk. On the other hand, if\nyour investment is small, you are not only freer to take risks, but favored to do so.\nThese ideas started with Charles Darwin. One hundred years later, they were developed in\nexquisite detail by the American evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers. Combined, they provide an\nexplanation for why, in most species including our own, males compete with each other for access to\nfemales ⎯⎯ the most valuable and limited resource ⎯⎯ and why females are picky, expressing an aesthetic\npreference for males of a particular quality. Selection favors parts of the body and brain associated with\ndominant males and picky females. Dominant males win fights against other males, and thus gain access\nto females. Dominant males take risks and are more aggressive. Picky females hold out for the best males,\nthose who provide the most desirable resources. Picky females are patient, waiting for males with good\ngenes, access to prime real estate, and the protective skills and motivation to defend them and their young.\nThese are qualities linked to high status. These are qualities associated with the ability to obtain and\ncontrol resources. These are the qualities that females desire.\nMale desire for dominance is therefore nurtured by female desire for dominant males. Like\nappetites, these desires seek satisfaction. Like appetitive addictions that create devastating consequences\nfor individuals, groups and nations, so too can our appetite for domination.\nRecall from the last chapter that testosterone and cortisol play a teeter-totter role in aggressive\ncompetition. When testosterone is high and cortisol is low, the motivation to fight and defend one’s\nresources is high. These two hormones, and the brain areas they impact, fuel the desire to maintain a\ncompetitive edge. Recall further that winners experience an increase in testosterone, and losers a\ndecrease, and that testosterone is addictive. Testosterone is therefore part of the system that links the\ndesire to outcompete and gain dominance status with the rewarding experience of winning and achieving\nhigh rank.\nTo attain high rank, including a competitive advantage over others with respect to food and\nmating opportunities, requires social knowledge. How tough is the alpha baboon or boss in a company,\nand what kind of support do they have from other individuals in the group? How sexually receptive are\nfemales when their hormonal cycles tilt them into a period of potential conception? What other males are\ninterested in these females? Attaining and maintaining high rank also requires attention to cues that are\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 64\ncontinuously changing, including where someone is looking and parts of the body that signal power and\nsexual availability. The American neuroscientist Michael Platt carried out a clever series of experiments\nto understand how much male rhesus monkeys value different kinds of social information and how much\nthey will pay to obtain it. As in our discussion of wanting and liking, Platt rightly assumed that rhesus\nmonkeys would value most what they like most, and that they would pay the highest price for what they\nare most motivated to acquire.\nEach monkey watched a slide show with viewing options akin to pay-per-view television. On a\ngiven trial, they could watch one of two images for as long as they liked, each viewing option associated\nwith a particular amount of juice. For each pair of images, one delivered more juice than the other. Given\nthat these were thirsty monkeys , they should prefer more juice over less juice. If monkeys have no\ninterest in the images per se ⎯⎯ because they have no value ⎯⎯ then their viewing preferences should be\nstrictly determined by where they can get the most juice. If, on the other hand, the images have value,\nand some images are more valuable than others, then they may be willing to look at an image that delivers\nless juice over an image that delivers more. This is costly viewing. This is paying for watching.\nEvidence for such preferences would reveal that rhesus monkeys value the social information that comes\nfrom the image over the juice itself, a surprising result given that juice is a primary reward whereas the\nimage is only a secondary reward, indicative of things to come.\nConsistently, these male monkeys had two favorite channels, preferring those showing pictures of\nhigh ranking individuals and close-ups of female hindquarters. They preferred these over images of low\nranking individuals, despite the fact that this choice often cost them the opportunity to drink more juice.\nPlatt's findings show that monkeys are motivated to acquire information about socially relevant\nsituations, including information about dominance and sex. Their motivation or desire to obtain this\ninformation is high, as evidenced by the fact that they are willing to pay a cost. Keeping an eye on a\ndominant is of value as dominants pose a threat, especially one staring at you. Keeping an eye on a\nfemale’s hindquarters is also of value as it can signal sexual receptivity: in rhesus monkeys, as in many\nother monkeys and apes, the area around the vagina either swells, turns red, or both when females are\novulating. This is important information for males in their attempts to court and mate females. I will\nquickly pass over the potential implication of these results for thinking about the origins of pornography.\nHumans also value social information, with many hours in a day devoted to obtaining such\ninformation through gossip. Many of us live in a world where dominance matters, whether it is climbing\nto the top of a corporate chain or attaining the title of heavyweight champion of the world. Individuals\nseek high status because of the physical and health benefits that accrue. In such societies, our sense of\nself is based on our comparison with others. It is also based on a strong sense of independence,\nautonomy, assertiveness, and uniqueness. In other societies, the self dissolves into the other, with an\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 65\nemphasis on inter-dependence, commonness, and openness to change in response to authority. These\ndifferences in self-perception show up when we attend to faces of familiar individuals. Chinese subjects,\nrepresentative of a collectivistic and inter-dependent society, responded more quickly to seeing their\nboss’s face than seeing their own face. In contrast, American subjects responded more quickly to their\nown face than to any other person’s face, including that of their boss. Like Platt’s monkeys, therefore, we\ntoo place value on social information. Unlike Platt’s monkeys, our sense of value in the social domain is\nmodulated by our cultural upbringing. This modulation, and the brain states that accompany it, shows up\nin direct comparisons of individuals who are motivated to attain high dominance status with those who\nare motivated to create equality.\nThe American social psychologist Joan Chiao used survey information to establish two groups of\nindividuals based on those who preferred to live in an egalitarian society and those who preferred a\nhierarchical society. These individuals then entered a brain scanner and viewed pictures of people\nexperiencing pain. Two areas, both associated with the personal experience of pain and the perception of\npain in others, were highly active. But these areas were less active in those who preferred hierarchies\nthan those who preferred egalitarianism. This finding, as Chiao notes, is consistent with the idea that in\nan egalitarian society, empathy for others well-being is essential. In egalitarian societies, seeing someone\nwho has less or is being harmed by another, should motivate a desire to redress the imbalance and reduce\nthe harm. In a dog-eat-dog hierarchical society, where dominants outcompete subordinates and inequities\nare part of life, concern for those at the bottom is a sign of weakness. These results show how cultural\ninfluences can shape brain activity, leading some to develop deep desires for dominance and inequities,\nwhereas others develop deep desires for equality. These brain areas heighten our sensitivity to what others\nhave, what we desire, and how our desires are modulated by what others have. These comparisons\nmotivate us to improve our status either by working harder ⎯⎯ a good thing ⎯⎯ or taking down those\nabove us ⎯⎯ a bad thing.\nI’ll have what she’s having\nOne of the most famous lines in movie history was delivered by Estelle Reiner in When Harry Met Sally,\na comedy produced by her son Rob Reiner. While Estelle is seated at a table in a delicatessen, Sally ⎯⎯\nplayed by Meg Ryan ⎯⎯ fakes having an orgasm to show Harry ⎯⎯ played by Billy Crystal ⎯⎯ that he\ncan’t tell the difference between fakes and the real deal. Overhearing Ryan’s performance, Estelle turns\nto the waiter and says “I’ll have what she’s having.” This is comparative shopping, cashing in on\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 66\nsomeone else’s subjective experience to guide our chosen experiences.\nOrgasms and eating are two of the great pleasures in life, whether you live in Tokyo, Toronto,\nToulouse, Tehran or Timbuktu? I doubt any healthy human adult would debate this. What can be debated\nis what counts as the ultimate orgasm or food experience. It can be debated both among friends and\ninside our own minds, influenced by personal experience and our knowledge of what else is available, or\nmight be.\nConsider potato chips. As a snack, potato chips generate a revenue in the United States of about\n$6-7 billion dollars each year, relying on the slicing and frying of about 2 billion pounds of potatoes.\nThese facts make clear that most Americans love potato chips, and are motivated to consume them. Like\nother salty snacks, it is hard to eat just one. The American psychologist Carey Morewedge and his\ncollaborators ran an experiment to find out how much people love potato chips, and whether their\nanticipated fondness for this delicious crisp changes in the face of other options. Subjects sat at a table in\nfront of a bowl of potato chips and an alternative food that was visible, but out of reach. The alternative\nwas either a highly undesirable snack such as sardines, or a highly desirable one such as Godiva\nchocolate. After subjects contemplated what it would be like to eat each of these foods, they then rated\nhow much they would enjoy them. This is like the study I described in the pleasure section where subjects\nrated how much they would enjoy different vacation destinations, but without the comparison between\none clearly good and one clearly bad spot. Both focus on the anticipation of a pleasurable experience.\nSubjects’ ratings of potato chip deliciousness soared when sardines were on offer, and plummeted\nin the presence of chocolate. Context matters. What is clearly delicious when there is nothing else on the\ntable, loses or gains in deliciousness when the table fills up with other delectable or disgusting\nalternatives.\nWhat’s happening to our pleasure detector, and especially our anticipated reward system, in the\npotato chip experiment? Are we incapable of understanding what makes us happy, unable to figure out\nwhat is or is not delicious, or are we fickle? What Morewedge’s experiment reveals is that deliciousness,\nlike ugliness, stubbornness, and obsequiousness, is a judgment, judgments are always relative or\ncomparative, and as such, based on some standard that is either present in the moment, stored away in\nour memories, or anticipated in the future. When Estelle Reiner uttered her famous line, she was using\nMeg Ryan’s orgasmic expression of delight as a comparative metric. When we compare food items or\nwine or pretty faces or sporty cars, we recruit our brain’s resources, especially the circuitry involved in\nattention, emotion and memory. Whether we say that potato chips are the best snack, or better than\nsardines, we have made a comparison that requires our attention, our capacity to keep at least two items in\nmemory, and a way of emotionally tagging each of the items. This comparison-shopping taxes our\nmental resources, recruiting them away from the job of evaluating one snack, and leading to a distorted\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 67\nevaluation of desirability.\nMorewedge’s experiments point to a mismatch between how delicious something is and how\ndelicious we think it will be, or how delicious we thought it was. It reveals a distortion in our capacity to\nanticipate ⎯⎯ or forecast in the words of the American social psychologist Daniel Gilbert ⎯⎯ how we will\nfeel, and in particular, how much we will like the experience. This is a problem for the elements of\npleasure that I laid out earlier in this chapter, as we expect the system that links wanting and liking to be\nwell honed, even optimized to make sure that we really want things we really like. Is this distortion\nsomething to expect across the board, independently of context, or is it specific to our food? Is the social\ndomain similarly vulnerable to a distorted view of anticipated pleasure?\nConsider revenge. When someone transgresses over the borders of social norms, either harming\nus or those we care about, we often seek revenge, motivated to even things up. We often imagine that\nrevenge will make us feel better, providing a honey hit to the brain that will satisfy our desire to redress\nan imbalance. But is this the outcome we consistently achieve when we follow through on a plot of\nrevenge or, as Sir Frances Bacon noted over three hundred years ago, might “A man that studieth revenge,\nkeeps his own wounds green, which otherwise would heal, and do well.” In more modern and plain\nEnglish, might our desire for revenge inoculate us against healing, creating an illusion that we will feel\nbetter? If so, revenge looks like an addictive process, with wanting unhinged from liking.\nThe American psychologist Kevin Carlsmith set up an experimental game that allowed each\nsubject within a group to contribute money to a public good. At the end of one round, the bank multiplied\nthe total by a pre-determined amount, divided this total by the number of players, and then redistributed\nthis amount to each player. In this game, the best for each player in the group is to contribute to the\ncommon pot because this maximized the returns. However, the best strategy for an individual is to defect,\nholding on to the initial endowment while reaping the rewards of everyone else’s generous contributions.\nThose who opt out of cooperation in a public good situation stand to benefit, especially in a world with no\npunishment.\nCarlsmith created an experimental world of punishment for some players, but not all, and then\nexplored how punishment contributed to a subject’s feelings. Some could pay to punish, some witnessed\nthe consequence of another’s punitive act, and some had no exposure to a game involving punishment.\nWhen given the opportunity to punish the defector, most people punished. Everyone, both\npunishers and non-punishers alike, expected punishment to feel good. They were wrong. Both punishers\nand those who witnessed punishment felt worse, with the act of punishment compounding the bad\nfeelings. The fact that the witnesses felt worse, as opposed to better, may seem at odds with our\nexperience of schadenfreude, of enjoying another’s misery. Shouldn’t the witnesses have rejoiced upon\ndiscovering that the offenders were slapped with a punitive fine? In our own personal experience with\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 68\nschadenfreude, as well as in studies that I will explore in a few sections, witnesses learn of a misfortune\nthat happens to another but this news has no direct bearing on the witness. In Carlsmith’s experiments, the\nwitnesses learn of a misfortune, but the offender’s defection has a direct bearing on the witness in terms\nof money lost. Thus, although punishment may feel good, the benefit may not make up for the lost\nincome.\nEveryone in Carlsmith’s experiments also believed that punishment would cause people to think\nless about the offender. They were wrong again. Punishers, but not those who simply witnessed\npunishment, ruminated more about the selfish offenders. Rumination led to more bad feelings. These bad\nfeelings led to more rumination, giving birth to a vicious cycle of feeling bad and ruminating about those\nwho cheated them of some money. Rumination heightened the comparative difference in resources.\nCarlsmith’s findings are paradoxical and disturbing. Paradoxically, they suggest that in some\nsituations, our expectations about the feeling of punishing an immoral act are inverted from the feelings\nwe feel following punishment: rather than feeling a happy high, we feel a depressing low, often\naccompanied by increasing anger. In the context of punishing a free-rider who stiffed the group, everyone\nexpects to feel a tingle of delicious delight, but many end up feeling angry instead. The entire polarity of\nthe emotion has switched, with rumination and anger dominating our thoughts. This is a dangerous state\nto enter. Faced with the strong belief and desire that revenge should feel good, but lacking any\nconfirmation, we are moved to find new evidence. With anger at the helm, there is only one solution:\nescalate the level of punishment, and continue to do so until it feels good. This is precisely the pattern I\ndescribed above for obesity: the wanting system continues to search for liking and reward, but fails, and\nthus continues. Whether it is an unsatisfied desire for food or revenge, the unfortunate consequence is an\nescalation to excess. Evil isn’t far behind, fueled by a variety of situations in which we fail to obtain what\nwe want.\nThe great leveler\nWe are often envious of those who have what we desire, whether it is good looks, money, a warm\nsupportive family, or a better tennis stroke. Envy can motivate us to change our looks, find careers that\nwill improve our finances, seek relationships that will provide additional support, and pick up a few extra\ntennis lessons to win the next match. Unfortunately, envy can quickly turn, as desire and a deep sense of\ninferiority transform into insatiable cravings to acquire whatever is necessary to gain superiority. Envy\nthus wears two masks, one benign and inspirational, the other malignant and destructive. As the writer\nDorothy Sayers noted, envy “is the great leveler; if it cannot level things up, it will level them down.”\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 69\nEnvy emerges out of our sense of fairness, fueled by competition. It is part and parcel of a\nhierarchical society. When we envy someone, we have detected a difference or inequity between our own\ncondition and that of another. We want what someone else has, presumably because we like what they\nhave. Wanting and liking are in harmony. Recognition of the inequity fuels competition to redress the\nimbalance. This sense of fairness appears early in child development, changing in systematic ways as a\nfunction of a culture’s norms.\nThe Swiss economist Ernst Fehr, who led the brain imaging studies of punishment and reward\ndiscussed in Chapter 1, assembled a team of developmental psychologists to test for evidence of fairness\nin young children ages 3-8 years old. Fehr was especially interested in when children recognize a\ndisparity or inequity in the distribution of resources, and what they are willing to do, if anything, to\nredress the imbalance. The experimenter paired up each child with a partner of the same age who was\neither from the same school or a different school; the school distinction was set up to look at in-group\nversus out-group differences which, as discussed in chapter 1, can lead parochial altruism ⎯⎯ the\nparadoxical result of greater cooperation among group members and greater hatred and violence toward\nthose outside. Though each child knew about their partner’s age and school affiliation, they never saw\ntheir partner. Each child therefore knew only that they were playing with someone from their school or\nsomeone unfamiliar to them.\nEach child played three different games. In each game, the experimenter told one child to decide\nhow to distribute a fixed amount of candy. In the prosocial game, the decider either takes one candy and\ngives one to the partner or takes one candy and gives nothing to the partner. If children are sensitive to\ninequities and want to share in order to make things fair, they should pick the 1-1 option; picking the 1-0\noption doesn’t affect the decider, but dings the partner. In the envy game, the decider has a choice\nbetween 1-1 and 1-2. As in the prosocial game, the decider gets the same amount of candy with both\noptions, but preserves equity with 1-1. Picking 1-1 also reveals that the child has an aversion to others\nhaving more, even when there is no personal cost. In the third, sharing game, the decider has a choice\nbetween 1-1 and 2-0. Here again, the decider gets candy in both cases, but the 2-0 option tempts the\ndesire for more, both personally and relatively. On the one hand, a greedy child will want more candy,\nand so 2 wins over 1. But picking the 2-0 option also leads to a greater difference with the partner, while\nrobbing them of an opportunity for any candy. If fairness prevails, deciders should pick 1-1. If\nselfishness prevails, motivated by competition, they should pick 2-0.\nAcross all three games, there was an increasing tendency from age 3 to 8 years old for children to\npick the fair distribution (1-1). Across all ages and games, children were most likely to pick the fair\ndistribution when playing against familiar than unfamiliar schoolmates. What these results reveal,\ntogether with many other similar studies, is that children are sensitive to the distribution of goods at an\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 70\nearly age, but with important developmental changes in play. There is a tendency for children to both\nrecognize inequities early in life, but to act selfishly when possible. The envy game shows this\nbeautifully. When another child could receive more, children rejected this option even though it wouldn’t\ncost them directly: the decider always gets just one candy. Though no one has yet worked out what\ncauses a developmental shift from more to less selfishness, most agree that it is driven by maturation of\nbrain regions guiding self-control, together with social factors that make young children increasingly\naware of and sensitive to their own and others’ reputations. Fehr’s studies also show that playing fair is\nnot just about the distribution of resources, but about who gets them. Early in life, children have already\ncarved up the world into those they know and those they don’t. This division drives their thinking and\nfeeling, and in cases like this, their sense of fairness. Young children are well on their way to developing\nparochial altruism.\nFehr’s research, and the majority of studies on the child’s developing sense of fairness, focus on\nchildren living in large-scale Western societies. Most of the work on fairness in adults is similarly\nfocused on large scale societies. The precise structure of these societies may directly impact how\nindividuals decide when to share, what commodities enter into the distribution, and whether sharing\ndepends on effort invested, needs, and power. As noted in the last section, those who support an\negalitarian society are more likely to feel empathy toward those in pain than those who support a\nhierarchical society. Individuals who are more empathic are also more altruistic. Hunter-gatherer\nsocieties tend to be more egalitarian, and highly cooperative. These differences predict further\ndifferences in how those living in small-scale societies, including the hunter-gatherers and subsistence\nfarmers of Africa, Asia, and South America, should respond to unfair exchanges.\nThe American anthropologist Joseph Henrich and his colleagues presented a set of bargaining\ngames to adults living in different small-scale societies across the globe. Though the subjects in this study\nplayed a number of different games, the basic goal was similar to those deployed by Fehr in his studies of\nchildren and adults: under what conditions will individuals choose to share an equal as opposed to an\nunequal distribution of resources?\nConsider the ultimatum game. One individual decides how to distribute a fixed amount of money\nto an anonymous partner; in the Henrich games, he always used the local currency and an amount that\nwas appropriate for the society. The partner had two options: keep what is on offer or reject it. Rejection\nis costly to both players as they leave empty handed. Rejection is both an expression of sour grapes for\nwhat could have been ⎯⎯ a fair offer ⎯⎯ and punishment for selfish behavior. In large scale societies,\noffers typically range from 40-50% of the initial pot, and rejections are common for offers less than about\n20%.\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 71\nAcross the globe, most people in these small scale societies offered some amount of the initial\npot. Across the globe, most people rejected really low offers. This shows the universal signature of\nfairness: an expectation of sharing resources and a no-tolerance view of greed. Cultures differed with\nrespect to how much they shared and whether they rejected. Some societies offered, on average, close to\n40%, while others offered as little as 15%. Some societies accepted virtually all offers, whereas others\nrejected both low and even high offers. Even in more egalitarian societies, therefore, there is sensitivity to\nunequal distributions. Even in egalitarian societies, there is a willingness to punish those who act\nunfairly, greedily taking more than their fair share.\nThe work I have discussed on fairness is only a fraction of the growing body of scientific\nevidence. What this research reveals is that a sense of fairness is part of human nature, appearing early in\ndevelopment, but guided by experience toward a particular cultural form. When our desire for fairness or\nequity combines with our competitive drive, envy often follows. Studies of the brain show how envy is\ngenerated from this combination.\nWhen healthy subjects sit in a brain scanner and learn about other individuals who have what they\ndesire, there is considerable activity in the anterior cingulate, and more activity in those who feel more\nenvious. This is not the envy center of the brain. There is no such area. But the recruitment of the anterior\ncingulate in other social situations helps us understand what is going on more generally in the case of\nenvy. The anterior cingulate activates when we experience pain from social exclusion, but not when we\nwitness such pain in others. It is one of the areas that was activated in Chiao’s work on the differences in\npain empathy for those supporting either an egalitarian or hierarchical society. The anterior cingulate is\nalso involved when our minds are pulled in two different directions, a situation that arises when we are\nforced to choose between two conflicting moral options ⎯⎯ for example, a duty to save the lives of many\nversus the prohibition of killing one person to save the lives of many. There is a common thread here that\nunites these different experiences. Like our experience of social exclusion, envy is also a form of social\npain and to some, deeply painful, as it reveals a sense of deficiency in acquiring resources. Envy also\nrepresents a situation in which our positive sense of self conflicts with the negative sense of self\nengendered by social comparison. Our brain ⎯⎯ and the anterior cingulate in particular ⎯⎯ informs us that\nwe are less accomplished when compared with others. Envy is socially imposed pain generated by\ncomparison shopping.\nEnvy highlights what we don’t have, which fuels the system of desire, which seeks satisfaction.\nUnsatisfied, envy runs wild. Unsatisfied, wanting keeps hunting for pleasure. Schadenfreude delivers\nsome prey.\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 72\nO Schadenfreude\nOn February 15, 1978, a relatively unknown boxer with few professional fights, stepped into the Las\nVegas boxing ring and snatched the world heavyweight champion title from Muhammad Ali. Ali, along\nwith his entourage of managers, coaches and fans were shocked, though no one denied that he lost. The\nunknown boxer was Leon Spinks. His only prior claim to fame, and ticket to a shot at Ali, was an\nOlympic gold medal two years earlier. With this win, not only did Spinks enjoy the heavyweight belt of\nchampions, but a cash prize of $350,000 and a promise of $3.8 million for the rematch with Ali. But this\nmeteoric rise to the top fizzled into a meteoric crash, driven by women, alcohol, sports cars, and a lack of\ntraining. Leon Spinks, aka “Neon Leon,” was living the fast life, and rapidly losing his status as a\nrespected sports hero.\nMoments before his rematch with Ali, he cruised the streets of New Orleans on top of a limousine\nwhile smoking a joint. He was flaunting his nonchalance, making fun of Ali’s age, and carrying on about\nhis ability to take the old champ without a single work out. When he entered the ring, Ali was ready.\nThough the match went the full fifteen rounds, it was no contest. Ali won.\nNewspaper writers and boxing fans celebrated the return of their champion, and mocked the\ndownfall of an ephemeral, arrogant, and out of control hero. After losing to Ali in the rematch, Neon\nLeon crashed further, losing all of his earnings, taking on odd jobs for minimum wage, losing a son in a\ngang fight, and suffering defeat after defeat in the boxing arena. From envied millionaire sports star to\nbankrupt fool and the laughingstock of the boxing world.\nWhen the envied fall down, we perversely enjoy the knock out. This is schadenfreude, a German\nword that describes the joy we feel in witnessing another’s misfortune. Though the emotion is universally\nunderstood, recognized in our written records at least as far back as Aristotle, the German language is one\nof the few to capture the feeling by tapping the brain’s promiscuity, combining the word for harm\n(schaden) with the word for joy (freude). Like envy, schadenfreude is a social, comparative emotion. It\nerupts when those we envy fall down, when someone we dislike meets his comeuppance, and when a\nmisfortune is deserved. But like envy, schadenfreude presents two faces, one elevating and virtuous, the\nother deflating and divisive. We should feel good when a person is caught crossing a moral line,\ncommitting an injustice. Such feelings not only reinforce our own adherence to moral norms, but\nencourage us to punish those who transgress. Such feelings instill courage in the service of expressing\nmoral outrage. As Robert F. Kennedy stated “Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle\nor intelligence.” Schadenfreude in this positive sense is the inner voice of moral courage. At the same\ntime, it can also be the inner voice of moral disengagement, providing justification for an observed harm.\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 73\nWhen this happens, our promiscuous brain has worked its combinatorial magic, causing us to feel good\nwhen we witness someone else’s misfortune.\nSchadenfreude, like envy, causes us to self-evaluate, looking inside of ourselves to assess our net\nworth relative to others. We know from a large body of studies, several carried out by the American\nsocial psychologist Roy Baumeister, that when an individual’s sense of self-worth is threatened,\nespecially those individuals with more narcissistic and overly confident personalities, aggression often\nfollows. The more personally threatened we feel, the more pleasure we should feel when someone else\nsuffers. The Dutch psychologist Wilco van Dijk tested this idea with two simple experiments. In both\nexperiments, subjects filled out a questionnaire that they believed evaluated their intellectual strengths.\nUpon completion and scoring of the questionnaire, some were told that they had utterly flopped, scoring\nin the lowest 10% of all subjects, while others were told that they performed brilliantly, scoring in the\nupper 10%. Next, all subjects read a scenario in which someone suffers a misfortune. For example, in one\nscenario, a student rents an expensive car to show off at a party, but then drives the car into a river, not\nonly damaging the car but requiring the fire department to tow it out. Those whose sense of self-worth\nwas threatened by the abominable test score were more likely to say that they felt good about the\nmisfortune, including smirks and laughter in response to the show off who submerged his rented car.\nThese results powerfully show that schadenfreude serves the beneficial function of hoisting our own selfworth.\nWhen our self-worth has been challenged, for whatever reason, we feel better knowing that\nsomeone else is worse off, regardless of context or direct relevance.\nOur desire to see others suffer so that we may feel better can escalate to absurd levels, especially\nwhen it is fueled by ideology. Beliefs can blind us to the cost-benefit analysis, motivating us to see harm\ndone to those outside of our inner sanctum even if it hurts us as well. Religious and political ideologies\nare two of the hotspots that can drive entirely irrational desires and absurd attributions.\nThe American psychologist Richard Smith explored whether an individual’s political convictions\ninfluenced the intensity of schadenfreude when witnessing a member of another party suffer, including\ncases where society at large also suffers. Smith initiated the study prior to the US Presidential elections in\n2004 involving Republican George W. Bush and Democrat John Kerry; during this period, the\nRepublicans controlled both executive branches of the government. Each subject ⎯⎯ all college\nundergraduates ⎯⎯ provided information about party affiliation and strength of support for the policies\nand beliefs of their party. Next, every subject read and provided reactions to short newspaper articles\ndescribing tragicomic moments for the two candidates, one in which Bush fell off his bicycle while\nriding, and the other involving Kerry wearing a bizarre space outfit during a visit to NASA. Last,\nsubjects read and reacted to an article describing job losses and the economic downturn facing the nation\n⎯⎯ an article meant to capture an objective cost to all members of society, irrespective of party affiliation.\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 74\nUnsurprisingly, Democrats expressed more pleasure from reading about Bush’s bicycle accident,\nwhereas Republicans were more joyful over Kerry’s bizarre space suit. Surprisingly, Democrats also\nexpressed pleasure from reading about the economic downturn, and more pleasure than the Republicans\nwho were more likely to express negative feelings about this situation. Thus, despite the fact that the\neconomic downturn hurt everyone, the Democrats expressed pleasure over the added damage this\ninflicted on the Republicans ⎯⎯ who they held responsible ⎯⎯ and conversely, the added benefit it\nbrought to the Democrats who could wag their fingers.\nIn a second study, Smith found that Democrats experienced more schadenfreude than\nRepublicans over the number of casualties reported out of the Iraq war, even though Iraqis were certainly\nnot preferentially targeting Republicans. The pleasure they experienced was entirely driven by the fact\nthat this was a war sponsored by a Republican government, and thus, the fatalities could be blamed on the\nRepublicans. From a Democrat’s perspective, even though everyone loses when soldiers die in war, it is a\nbigger loss for Republicans, and thus, a bigger gain for Democrats. With schadenfreude, it is all about\ncomparative shopping. It is all about satisfying our desires relative to others.\nAs noted above, schadenfreude appears to emerge strongly when an individual’s misfortune is\ndeserved. To explore what is happening in the brain when such pleasure is experienced, and the\nsituations that might trigger it, the German cognitive neuroscientist Tania Singer set up a study involving\nhealthy men and women. In the first phase, subjects played a bargaining game for money against an\nunfamiliar partner; prior to the game, and unbeknownst to the subject, Singer set things up so that the\npartner played either fairly or unfairly. After the game, each subject entered a scanner, and watched their\npartner receive a painful shock to the hand.\nPredictably, Singer discovered that both men and women liked the fair players better than the\nunfair players, and showed more empathy to fair players when they were shocked. Proof of empathy was\nread off the images of brain activation, especially the brain circuitry known to be involved in pain\nempathy, and mentioned earlier in my discussion of Joan Chiao’s work on social hierarchies: the insula\nand anterior cingulate. Unpredictably, Singer discovered that the level of activity in this pain empathy\ncircuitry was reduced when men ⎯⎯ but not women ⎯⎯ saw unfair players receive pain. She also observed\nthat in men ⎯⎯ but not women ⎯⎯ there was increased activity in the nucleus accumbens ⎯⎯ an area\nmentioned earlier on that, in rats, monkeys and humans is consistently associated with the experience of\nreward and liking. The more individual men desired revenge for an unfair offer, the more activity they\nshowed in this reward area.\nSinger’s findings are joined by many others showing that the nucleus accumbens, together with\nother reward areas, are activated in a wide variety of situations in which we gain from others’ pain. But\nbecause these same areas also respond to non-social, non-comparative experiences, such as eating, we\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 75\ncome back to a critical point in this chapter: areas that evolved for one function are readily recruited for\nothers, especially in a promiscuous brain like ours. As long as something makes us feel good, whether it\nis winning, eating, social comparison, or harming another, the reward areas of the brain turn on.\nSchadenfreude is one of the mind’s ambassadors, enabling us to journey from a state of inferiority\nto superiority. It enables “imaginary revenge” in the words of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.\nLike envy, it is highly adaptive, focusing our attention on inequities. Like envy, it is also maladaptive,\nrewarding us when the inequity is not only addressed, but results in another’s failure and misery. If failure\nis associated with violence, including death, so be it. The brain is poised to inspire our desire to harm or\nwitness harm in order to feel good.\nAn appetite for violence\nBillions of people, perhaps all humans, have had vivid fantasies about sex, violence, or sexual violence.\nAre these fantasies like food fantasies, cravings that need to be satisfied? Or, as some theories would have\nit, are sexual and violent fantasies satisfying on their own, playing a cathartic role, releasing energy and\nthus, reducing the need to act out?\nSeung-Hui Cho was born in South Korea and then moved to the United States with his parents.\nDuring his first three years in college, both students and professors in his literature and theatre courses\ndescribed his writings as disturbing and disgusting, and his actions toward other students as ominous and\nfrightening. One professor noted that his creative pieces “seemed very angry,” while another demanded\nthat he be removed from the class. A classmate noted that his plays were “really morbid and grotesque…I\nremember one of them very well. It was about a son who hated his stepfather. In the play, the boy threw a\nchainsaw around and hammers at him. But the play ended with the boy violently suffocating the father\nwith a Rice Krispy treat.” Cho was advised to seek counseling. He didn’t. No one followed up. A\nprofessor aware of his often inappropriate comments and behavior contacted members of the\nadministration. No response. Several women alerted the campus police after Cho stalked them. No\ndisciplinary action was taken despite his repeated offenses. As in the SEC’s tin ear to the alarms\nsurrounding Madoff’s dubious securities, so too was everyone at Cho’s university deaf to his alarming\nbehavior in class and out.\nDuring his senior year, Cho wrote an essay describing his anger toward rich kids, the unfairness\nof life, and his own misery. He also described a revenge fantasy, packed with images of retaliation\ntoward those who had what he lacked. He sent his reflections along with excessively violent photographs\nand videotapes to the New York headquarters of NBC news. Under a photograph of bullets he provided\nthe caption “All the [shit] you've given me, right back at you with hollow points.\"\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 76\nOn April 16, 2007, Cho dressed up in army fatigues. He left his dormitory and killed 32 people\nand wounded 25 others with a semi-automatic Glock 19 pistol filled with hollow-point bullets, designed\nto cause more tissue damage than traditional bullets. Cho then shot himself in the temple, ending his life\nand the Virginia Tech massacre.\nCho’s case provides a horrifying example of how fantasies of violence can lead to real life\nenactments and a trail of blood. It also provides a counter-example of the catharsis view: Cho’s fantasies\nabout violent revenge did not make him feel better. It made him feel worse and more violent ⎯⎯ a pattern\nsupported by dozens of studies.\nNormally raised children as young as seven years old are more likely to act aggressively toward\ntheir peers if they are self-absorbed in a world of aggressive fantasy, and this is especially the case for\nchildren who witnessed violence or were subjected to it. Adult men and women are more likely to crave\nviolence after reading an argument in favor of the cathartic magic of violent fantasies than after reading a\nmanifesto against catharsis. Men who engage in aggressive sexual fantasies are more likely to engage in\naggression, but only if they are narcissists. Men who engage in deviant sexual fantasies are more likely to\nenact these fantasies, but only if they exhibit signs of psychopathy. Psychopathy and narcissism are like\nSiamese twins, inseparable. What these studies show is that those who are self-absorbed and play with\nviolent or sexual fantasies, are most likely to take these imaginary worlds onto the real world stage.\nFurther evidence of the connection between violent fantasies and violent actions comes from\nstudies by the German psychologist Thomas Elbert who studied child soldiers brainwashed into joining\nthe ranks of the Lord’s Resistance Army, Northern Uganda’s rebel group. Since its inception in 1987, the\nLRA has recruited 25-65,000 children, starting with boys and girls as young as 10-12 years old. In\ndetailed interviews and analyses of now retired child soldiers, Elbert discovered that those who had more\nexperience with killing developed stronger, appetite-driven fantasies of killing, a hunger that had to be\nfulfilled by real killing. As one ex-child soldier noted “The more we killed, the more we acquired a taste\nfor it. If you are allowed to act out this lust it will never let you go again. You could see the lust in our\ngreed popping eyes. [...] It was an unprecedented pleasure for everyone.” Not only was fantasy converted\ninto killing, but the more they killed, the less they experienced any trauma in later life. Unlike the droves\nof veterans who have been returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and suffer from post-traumatic stress\ndisorder or PTSD, these child soldiers developed an immunity. Many of the veterans from Iraq and\nAfghanistan had no interest in killing, and deemed the war unnecessary. In contrast, these child soldiers\nwere brain washed into believing that killing was necessary, and a sign of importance. Killing that is\njustified is rewarding, whether the justification is real or the product of self-deception. When selfdeception\njoins the fray ⎯⎯ as I further develop in chapter 3 ⎯⎯ killing is not only rewarding but virtuous.\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 77\nCho’s case is not the exception, but the rule: persistent fantasies, whether sexual, violent, or\nsexually violent, are often played out in real life. When people voice their fantasies, we should open our\nears. When therapists, especially those influenced by the catharsis view of the mind, encourage their\npatients to engage in aggressive fantasies to release their pent up energy, we should bring forward\nmalpractice suits as they are accomplices to crime.\nWhat kind of mind is most likely to rev up the fantasy world to supersonic levels and then\nunleash it in the service of excessive harm? Lust murderers ⎯⎯ individuals with a craving for the bizarre and\ndegenerate ⎯⎯provide one answer to this question. Lust murderers are typically repeat offenders or serial\nkillers. The serial nature of their crimes comes from the fact that they are motivated by recurrent\nfantasies that create recurrent cravings. They are, effectively, addicted to violence. Their fantasies often\nentail some kind of paraphilia ⎯⎯ an extreme and abnormal sexual arousal to objects, people or situations\n⎯⎯ played out through some form of sadism ⎯⎯ a persistent pattern of sexual or non-sexual pleasure from\nhumiliating, punishing and harming others. Here again we see the promiscuous human mind at work,\nseamlessly blending pleasure and violence, animate and inanimate attractions, sometimes with benign\norigins, but often with malignant outcomes. Thus, the pleasure derived from humiliation may develop out\nof the more common, normal and less harmful pleasure we experience from mockery and humor.\nHumiliation is just a small step away in a mind that derives joy from others’ demise.\nThe paraphilias, like many of the other disorders that appear within the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Health, fall along a continuum from rather benign forms of voyeurism to\nerotophonophilia, the vicious and sadistic killing of an innocent victim in order to achieve ultimate sexual\nsatisfaction. Regardless of the particular object or situation driving the paraphilia, individuals become\naddicted. Like other addictions, including those associated with food, drugs, and alcohol, paraphilic\naddicts experience withdrawal. Dangerously for the world around them, the erotophonophilic or lust killer\nharbors sadistic paraphilias, including flagellation ⎯⎯ the need to club, whip or beat someone ⎯⎯\nanthropophagy ⎯⎯ the desire to eat human body parts ⎯⎯ picquerism ⎯⎯ a craving to stab someone or cut\noff their flesh, focusing especially on genitals and breasts ⎯⎯ and necrosadism ⎯⎯ a yearning to have\nsexual contact with the dead. Although these desires may seem unimaginable, they reveal one facet of the\nhuman mind’s potential ⎯⎯ a potential that was fully realized in the mind of Jeffrey Dahmer who\nflagellated, cannibalized, dismembered, and engaged in necrophilia with his 17 victims. Such disordered\nminds are part of the human condition, one that stretches from individuals who never cache in on their\nfantasies to those who not only deliver, but develop ⎯⎯ as in addictions to food and drugs ⎯⎯ deeper and\ndeeper desires for harming others without the rewards that come from such harm. When wanting and\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 78\nliking part company, with liking falling dormant due to sensitization, wanting grows in intensity, seeking\nbut failing to find satisfaction. So begins an appetite for violence, one that can turn into a craving.\nA craving to impress\nGazelles on the Serengeti plains of Tanzania sometimes move in an exceptionally bizarre way. With legs\nrigidly extended, they bounce up and down like kangaroos. There is no obvious function associated with\nthis movement. If anything, it appears energetically wasteful. If these gazelles lived in tall grass, one\nmight think that the bouncing was designed to better see or be seen. But the Serengeti plains are flat and\nthe grass is short. Gazelles can see for miles in this habitat and so can everything else that shares this\ngorgeous part of the planet with them. This includes the lions, leopards and cheetah that think of gazelles\nas breakfast, lunch and dinner. Why would a gazelle advertise like this? Why alert predators to your\nlocation and availability? Why not use the coloration of your fur to blend into the color scheme of the\nsavannah, moving swiftly but imperceptibly?\nWe can explain the gazelle’s bizarre movements ⎯⎯ called stotting ⎯⎯ by thinking economically,\nusing Zahavi’s honest signaling theory that I described in Chapter 1. Whenever evolutionary biologists\nsee a behavior that is costly, they immediately search for a potential benefit. The reason is simple:\nbehaviors that tax an individual's chances of survival and reproduction are ultimately weeded out by the\nforce of natural selection. There must be some benefit to the individual or to others in order to neutralize\nthe costs. Given the ostentatious nature of the gazelle’s stotting, who benefits and how? Since the\nbehavior is eye-poppingly interesting to human observers, one assumes that it is eye-popping to other\nanimals on the Serengeti plains as well. Gazelles typically stot when they detect danger which, in the\nSerengeti, means leopards, lions and cheetah. If gazelles stot to alert other gazelles, then most gazelles\nshould stot, at least some of the time. This is because all gazelles are vigilant, should have multiple\nopportunities to see these predatory cats, and should benefit from an alarm signal. But this is not what we\nobserve. Instead, stotting seems to be reserved for those in good shape. When gazelles stot, they appear to\nbe sending a cease and desist signal to any observant cat. If this is the gazelles’ message, then cats should\nselectively chase non-stotters over stotters. And when cats turn a blind eye to stotting gazelles and chase\nthem, they should have less success than when they chase non-stotters. Stotters are turbo-charged.\nStotting is simply their way of showing off.\nThese expectations are supported by the British biologists Claire Fitzgibbon and Tim Caro who\nspent hundreds of hours watching gazelles and predatory cats. What they reveal is that stotting is an\nhonest signal of condition or quality. Only gazelles in good condition can tolerate the costs of stotting.\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 79\nStotting handicaps the individual, imposing a significant cost on the ability to move. But the cost paid is\nrelative to the individual’s condition. Without the cost and the ability to manage it, everyone could stot.\nAnd if everyone could stot, the cats would quickly figure out how meaningless it is and look for other\ncues to vulnerability.\nStotting appears excessive, but in fact is an honest signal of power. It is, to borrow a phrase from\nthe economist Thorstein Veblen, \"conspicuous consumption.\" By flaunting their superior condition,\nthrowing away resources just because they can, these stotting gazelles benefit in the long run, living\nlonger and leaving more offspring who will inherit their qualities. These ideas carry over into human\nbehavior, from big spenders to, I suggest, big harmers.\nThe American anthropologist James Boone has suggested that human magnanimity evolved as\ndid stotting, as an honest signal of wealth and power. It represents a desire to impress through wastage.\nHandicap yourself in the short run to benefit your wealth and status in the long run. Big tippers don't tip\nin private, but in the presence of those who can admire their lavish tips. Hunter-gatherers who bring home\nlarge prey from a day of hunting don't make cryptic deposits for others, but make sure that their offerings\nare public. The Mayan pyramids were not built for personal enjoyment behind walled enclosures, but in\nthe open, visible to potential enemies as displays of excessive power to create something really big and\ncostly. Rappers such as JayZ, Puff Daddy, and 50 cent don't have absurdly lavish cribs with a six pack of\nsports cars because this is what they like, but because this is what they can show off on MTV. Flaunting,\neven at a substantial cost, provides a path to power. This is a club whose motto reads “Impress with\nexcess.”\nMy suggestion is that excessive harms work as honest signals of wealth and power. Here we\ncombine the HOW of evil ⎯⎯ discussed in this chapter ⎯⎯ with the WHY of evil ⎯⎯ discussed in chapter 1.\nWhen millions are raped, slashed, burned, chopped up, gored, and dropped out of planes before dying,\nthere are only two possible explanations: the evildoer is clinically mad with no sense of moderation or a\nhealthy schemer who has allowed desire to run wild. The schemers are like stotting gazelles, wanting to\nimpress others of their awesome powers by performing high risk displays. The schemers deploy\nproactive, premeditated, and cold violence ⎯⎯ like predators. As the sociologist Wolfgang Sofsky noted in\nhis commentary on the Nazi concentration camps “Individuals demonstrated commitment by acting, on\ntheir own initiative, with greater brutality than their orders called for. Thus excess did not spring from\nmechanical obedience. On the contrary; its matrix was a group structure where it was expected that\nmembers exceed the limits of normal violence.” Unfortunately for society ⎯⎯ past, present and future ⎯⎯\nthe Nazis are not an isolated case. When Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadic, and Ratko Mladic\nlaunched their ethnic cleansing initiative, they didn’t just displace or kill Albanians and Croatians, they\nraped their women, old and young, in front of husbands, fathers, and grandfathers ⎯⎯ and then killed man\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 80\nof them. Admiral Luis Maria Mendia, one of the leaders in Argentina’s “Dirty war,” convinced victims to\nboard a plane under the pretext of a freedom flight, and then once in flight, were thrown out of the plane,\nadding sheer terror to the brutality of their death. Accounts such as these litter the pages of history. They\nreveal that the desire to impress with excess is part of human nature.\nWhat we have learned in this chapter is that our biology hands us the tools for excess, and hands\nsome of us more than our fair share. This does not mean that we will or must use such tools. It also\ndoesn’t mean that the tools were designed for excess. Some are endowed with genes that predispose to\nsensation-seeking and risk-taking, others to brain circuitry and chemistry that create an insatiable desire\nfor reward. Different environments either encourage this biology or discourage it, a topic that occupies\nchapter 4. As the eighteenth century poet William Blake remarked “The road to excess leads to the palace\nof wisdom… for we never know what is enough until we know what is more than enough.” To more\ndeeply understand how our desires runaway to excess, we need to understand how the mind facilitates this\nprocess. We need to understand the role of denial. We need to understand how individuals and groups\ndehumanize the other and self-deceive themselves into believing that those unlike them represent a threat\nto their purity and power. We need to understand how desire and denial combine to pave the way to\nexcessive harms.\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 81\nEndnotes: Chapter 2\nRecommended books\nBloom, P. (2010).

Runaway desire 84\nChapter 3:\nRavages of denial\nSelf denial is not a virtue: it is only the effect of prudence on rascality.\n-- George Bernard Shaw\nIn October of 1980, a 39 year old man walked into the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, having\nsuffered a gun shot to the left side of his skull. Once the medical team removed the bullet fragments and\ncleared the blood clot, the man was able to speak. He had shot himself, aiming at his second head. Yes,\nhis second head. This man believed that he had two heads, his own and the head of his dead wife’s\ngynecologist. Before his wife died in a car accident, he believed that she was having an affair with her\ngynecologist. At night, the second head spoke, accompanied by voices from Jesus and Abraham who\nconfirmed the existence of the second head. As the patient expressed to the interviewing doctor “The\nother head kept trying to dominate my normal head, and I would not let it. It kept trying to say to me I\nwould lose, and I said bull-shit.” “I am the king pin here” it said and it kept going on like that for about\nthree weeks and finally I got jack of it, and I decided to shoot my other head off.” Over a two year period,\nthe perception of the second head disappeared. The attending neuropsychologist, David Ames, described\nthe case as an example of schizophrenia-induced delusional bicephaly ⎯⎯ a distortion of reality that\ncreates a false belief of two heads.\nCases like this are bizarre. But like many neuropsychological reports, they force us to reevaluate\nour perception of reality, what’s normal and what’s distorted, what’s adaptive and what’s maladaptive.\nThe Australian patient who developed delusional bicephaly was suffering from the loss of his wife. Loss\nand suffering motivate explanation, along with something or someone to blame: Was it really an\naccident? Why her? Why not me? What if she had stayed home that morning? What if I had been driving\nwith her? Was she distracted by her lover? Was he in the car? These questions represent gaps in a\nnarrative, holes that we attempt to fill, often by distorting reality.\nDistortions of reality are common. Even the healthiest among us create stories designed to\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 85\nexplain a puzzle in our lives or to help us through trauma. These stories are narratives that provide new\ntruths by denying particular elements of reality. They represent the mind’s method of filling in gaps,\nproviding justifications for what we can’t explain or wish to explain in a different way. This is an\nadaptive feature of the human mind, one that is uniquely human. But this same feature can be used to\njustify immoral and atrocious behaviors, the kind that lead to excessive harms. When we distort reality\nby treating others as non-human, perceiving and judging them as animals, parasites, or machines, we have\narmed ourselves with a weapon that enables great harms by removing the moral consequences of our\nactions. Animals, parasites and machines are outside of our moral concerns, so we shouldn’t feel guilty,\nor wrack our conscience when we end their lives or ability to move. Animals, parasites and machines\ndon’t have rights, and thus, we have no obligation to them. Similarly, when we distort reality by means\nof deception and self-deception, we have armed ourselves with weapons that enable desire to run wild.\nSelf-deception generates overconfidence. Overconfidence enables us to pursue our desire for power,\nfreed from the reins that pull us back, away from costly interactions. Self-deception allow us to convince\nourselves and deceive others that we are under attack, threatened by those who are unlike us. Under the\ncircumstances, we are justified in using self-defense, even if this leads to annihilating the enemy. Often,\nself-deception combines with dehumanization to maximize the effectiveness of the distortion, paving an\nunobstructed path for runaway desire. Denial enables desire to achieve satisfaction, minus the moral\nconscience. These are the ideas that I will explore in this chapter.\nBefore discussing the scientific evidence that explains how the brain distorts reality by\ndehumanizing and self-deceiving ⎯⎯ two core elements of denial ⎯⎯ we must understand how the brain\ncreates the reality of humanization, a process that imbues some things but not others with human qualities\nand moral worth. This is an important problem as it shapes our perception of evil, who can cause\nexcessive harm and who can suffer from it. Rocks can cause great pain ⎯⎯ as in landslides ⎯⎯ but we\ndon’t hold them responsible for the harm caused because they lack intentions, beliefs, goals, and desires.\nRocks can also be crushed, pulverized into sand by humans working in a quarry. But rocks are neither\ninnocent nor victims as they have no moral worth, no capacity to suffer, and no ability to intentionally\nharm another. If not rocks, what?\niHuman\nEarthquakes, viruses, chimpanzees, children, and psychopaths can all cause harm to others, including\nhumans and other animals. We might be tempted to think that only psychopaths are rightfully classified\nas evildoers because they are the only ones that can cause excessive harm to innocent others with harm as\na goal. But this begs the question of what we mean by excessive, innocent, and goal.\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 86\nEarthquakes, viruses, chimpanzees, and some children often cause excessive harm to innocent\nothers, at least if the focus is on numbers and the way in which death arises. The earthquake that reached\na magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale and demolished the capital of Haiti in 2010 took the lives of\napproximately 200,000 people, all innocent and undeserving of this natural disaster. This is excess\nbeyond what any psychopath has ever achieved. The Spanish Flu found its way into the bodies of\ninnocent people from the Arctic to the Pacific Islands from 1918 to 1920, and killed over 50 million\npeople — a death toll that is at least four times higher than what Hitler caused during his reign, and\ncomparable to that achieved by Mao Ze-Dong during his. As noted in chapter 1, chimpanzees kill at a\nrate that approximates many hunter-gatherer groups. When they kill, the frenzied attacks are over the top,\ninvolving gruesome dismemberment of their victims by biting into the face, ripping off testicles and\ndislocating limbs. By the age of 15 years, Willie James Bosket Jr had committed some 200 armed\nrobberies, stabbed 25 innocent victims, kicked a boy off of a roof to his death, and killed two men\nfollowing a failed robbery, all “for the experience.” At the level of outcomes, these are all horrific cases\nof lives lost, with some excessive in terms of numbers and others in terms of means.\nWe can eliminate earthquakes and other natural disasters from the list of evildoers by noting that\nthey don’t have, as their goal or as a foreseen consequence, the elimination of lives, innocent or not. They\ndon’t have goals at all. This also eliminates them from the class of victims, assuming the day comes when\nscientists can kill off earthquakes, cyclones, hurricanes, blizzards and so on before they pick up enough\nsteam to cause great harm. One might think that viruses, and their virulent partners the parasites, lack\ngoals because they lack brains. This intuition is correct anatomically, but incorrect conceptually. As the\nAmerican philosopher Daniel Dennett has noted, the beauty of Darwin’s theory of natural selection is that\nit provided a way of giving nature competence without comprehension. Thus, viruses and parasites have\ngoals without understanding at all. To survive and reproduce, they have evolved exquisite chemical and\nelectrical machines that harvest all of their host’s resources. And if making a living requires killing the\nhost, so be it. They do so without shedding a tear. No guilt, no remorse. Chimpanzees, on the other hand,\nhave goals and brains that represent them. When chimpanzees kill, their goal is not food. Their brutal\nattacks are motivated by a desire to outcompete their rivals and absorb additional resources; no one\nknows if they feel guilt or remorse. Willie Bosket’s goal was to rob two men, but when he failed, he\nturned to gratuitous violence, for the experience. Bosket certainly could, as a human, feel guilt and\nremorse, but all reports indicate he didn’t.\nWe can eliminate parasites and viruses from the list of evildoers and evilreceivers by noting that\nthey lack an understanding of right and wrong, and are incapable of suffering. Chimpanzees are a harder\ncase. They live in societies with norms and respond aggressively to norm transgressions, as occurs when a\nhigh ranking male beats a lower ranking male for trying to steal food or a mating opportunity.\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 87\nChimpanzees also suffer, experiencing pain from both physical attacks and social loss. But getting angry\nat something or someone and feeling pain from a physical or social assault are different from getting\nangry because someone’s behavior was morally wrong, and suffering from a morally toxic action. I get\nangry at my computer all the time, swearing when it crashes, and even smacking it on its backside. But\nthere is no moral harm. In this sense, there is no evidence that chimpanzees have a sense of right and\nwrong, and that the pain they experience is linked to a sense of how one ought to behave. Chimpanzees\ncan’t be evildoers, but they certainly can, and have been evilrecipients.\nThere is also an important difference between violently harming another and knowing it is wrong,\nand harming another because it is wrong. The latter fits at least one view of evil, a kind of radical evil in\nwhich harm is created for harm’s sake, because it is rewarding. When Willie Bosket killed those two men,\nhe was certainly old enough to know the difference between right and wrong. He most likely killed\nknowingly, perhaps for the generic experience of shooting someone, but perhaps not with a desire to harm\nfor harm’s sake. Then again, when he noted that he killed for the experience, perhaps this was the\nexperience of pleasure from harming another.\nWas Willie Bosket responsible for his shootings? The answer to this question depends on how\nwe think about Bosket’s options, and the link between cause and effect. At the simplest level, Bosket\ncaused the death of the two men in the same way that a swinging wrecking ball can cause the death of two\nmen. But the wrecking ball can’t be held accountable or responsible in the same way that Bosket can.\nWrecking balls lack options and lack the capacity to predict the consequences of their actions. Bosket\nhad options, could foresee the consequences of his actions, and had the capacity to act upon his options.\nOr did he?\nWe know that the frontal lobes of the brain play an important role in self-control and emotional\nregulation. We also know that this area of the brain is not fully mature until people reach their midtwenties.\nBosket was, therefore, operating with an immature brain. His actions were, in some ways, like\nthe wrecking ball, driven by inertia. Perhaps the frustration of failing to achieve his goal — robbery —\ncaused a dizzying chemical reaction in his brain, causing a flood of emotions, blinding his capacity to\nthink rationally. Paraphrasing the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek, these electrochemical storms in\nBosket’s brain caused him to deposit his conscience at the door. Like the husband who finds his wife in\nbed with her lover and kills them both on the spot, Bosket committed a crime of passion. On this account,\nnot only is he not evil, he is pardonable.\nImmaturity is a mitigating factor when we evaluate a crime. It is why, in many countries, there is\none legal system for youths and another for adults. It is why, in countries with the death penalty, such as\nthe United States, youths are immune. With maturity comes a heightened capacity to control ones\nactions, or at least, to gain better self-control and thus, to take responsibility for what one does. This\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 88\nmeans that maturation eventually legitimizes individuals as potential evildoers. It does not, however,\ncause a shift in our sense of evilrecipients. Willie Bosket may not have been an evildoer, but he certainly\ncould have been an evilrecipient.\nWhat about psychopaths, people like Charles Manson and Ted Bundy? Pop culture tells us that\nthey are depraved, heinous, immoral monsters, deliberately causing harm to others, and often with a\ndelicious twinkle in their eye. But what if I told you that several recent studies of psychopaths indicate\nthat they know the difference between right and wrong? When judging the moral permissibility of\ndifferent actions, such as harming one person to save the lives of many, psychopaths’ judgments are often\nlike yours and mine, nuanced, varying depending upon the outcomes and the means by which they are\nachieved. This is a rational, albeit largely unconscious understanding of right and wrong. This makes\npsychopaths nothing like earthquakes, viruses, chimpanzees, or young children. It also means that they\ndon’t have bad moral principles, but rather, ones that are like yours and mine. What if I further told you\nthat before they develop into fully licensed-to-kill or extort psychopaths, many have an early history of\ntorturing pets and bullying other kids. What if I further told you that when they cooked the cat in the\nmicrowave or bloodied little Johnny’s face with their fist, that the consequences of their actions left them\ncold ⎯⎯ no guilt, remorse, or shame. Nothing. And what if I told you that these people are born with a\ndifferent brain chemistry and structure than you or I, leading to poor self-control and an emotionally\ncallous view of the world? If this medical report is correct, and I believe the scientific evidence supports\nit, then psychopaths lack the ability to see alternative options and act on them. They also lack the\nresources for self-control. Given this evidence, psychopaths are not evil at all, though the consequences\nof their actions are often excessively heinous. Given this evidence, not one member of our initial list\nwould count as evildoers, though chimpanzees, children and psychopaths would all count as potential\nevilrecipients.\nWhat this discussion highlights is that our perception of evildoers and evilrecipients is influenced\nby our sense of what it means to be human. Though evildoers and evilreceivers overlap in their capacities\nto think and feel, there are differences, captured by Aristotle’s distinction between moral agents ⎯⎯ those\nwho have responsibility for others well being ⎯⎯and moral patients ⎯⎯ those who deserve moral\nconsideration and care from moral agents. The distinction gains scientific credibility thanks to a set of\nstudies by the American psychologists Kurt Gray and Daniel Wegner. In one experiment, a large internet\npopulation compared the qualities of different things, including humans at different stages of\ndevelopment ⎯⎯ fetus, baby, child, and adult ⎯⎯ an adult human in a vegetative state, a dead human,\nnonhuman animals ⎯⎯ frog, pet dog, chimpanzee ⎯⎯ God, and a socially savvy robot. Subjects judged\ndifferent pairings of these things on a wide range of dimensions, including which was more likely to\ndevelop a unique personality, feel embarrassed, suffer pain, distinguish right from wrong, experience\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 89\nconscious awareness, exert greater self-control, plan ahead, develop fears, feel pleasure, and erupt into\nrage. Subjects also provided their personal opinions on which individual, within the pair, they liked most,\nwanted to make happy or destroy, was most deserving of punishment, and most likely had a soul.\nI assume that everyone reading about the design of this study has already formed an opinion\nabout some of the comparisons. Presumably everyone believes that a living adult is more consciously\naware than a dead person, fetus, dog, and robot. Presumably everyone believes that all animals feel more\npain than a dead human or a robot. And presumably everyone would rather make a dog happy than a\nfrog, and would be more likely to allocate souls to fetuses, babies, and adult humans than to robots and\nfrogs. But are we more conscious than God? Does a chimpanzee feel more embarrassed than a baby? Can\na person in a vegetative state feel more pleasure than a frog or robot? What dimensions, if any, cause us\nto lasso some things together but not others? What things cluster together and why? As a reminder: this\nstudy is about our intuitions, not about what scientists have discovered about the minds and emotions of\nthese different things.\nAdding up the large set of responses produced a map or landscape defined by two dimensions:\nexperience and agency. Experience included properties such as hunger, fear, pain, pleasure, rage, desire,\nconsciousness, pride, embarrassment, and joy. Agency included self-control, morality, memory, emotion\nrecognition, planning, communication and thinking. Experience aligned with feelings, agency with\nthinking. With these dimensions, we find God at one edge, high in agency and low in experience. On the\nopposite side, huddled together on the landscape, defined by low agency and high experience, we find\nfetuses, frogs, and people in a vegetative state. High in both agency and experience were adult men and\nwomen. Robots and dead people were low on experience and in the middle for agency, whereas dogs,\nchimpanzees, and human kids were high on experience and middling on agency. This landscape not only\nhelps us understand how people classify these different entities, but also plays a more active role in\nguiding individuals’ judgments to punish, provide pleasure, and avoid harm. If you have to harm\nsomething, pick an entity low in experience, such as dead people and robots who can’t suffer. If you have\nto punish something, pick an entity high in agency, such as living adults who recognize the difference\nbetween right and wrong and have the capacity for self-control.\nWhat this work shows is that people have strong intuitions about which things are morally\nresponsible as agents and which are deserving of our moral concerns as patients. Moral patients are high\nin experience, and can thus suffer as victims, innocent or not. This is why many countries have created\nlaws against harming nonhuman animals, including restrictions on which animals can serve in laboratory\nexperiments, what can be done to them, and how they should be housed. This is also why we don’t do\nexperiments on fetuses, newborns, adults in a vegetative state, or humans with neurological disorders that\nknock out aspects of their experience and agency. Once something enters the arena of moral patients, we\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 90\ntend to leave them within this arena even if they lose particular capacities. Conversely, if scientists\ndiscover that an organism outside the arena of moral patient-hood has capacities of experience and agency\nthat are on a par with those inside the arena, this evidence often promotes their legal status and protection.\nSuch was the fate of the octopus, an invertebrate once classified by Aristotle as “stupid”, but now\nelevated to the company of much smarter animals that solve novel problems, deploy trickery, and show\nsome evidence of being aware of their behavior. As such, they are one of the few invertebrates to enjoy\nheightened protection and care when they are kept in captivity.\nMoral agents are high in agency, meaning that they can distinguish right from wrong, exert selfcontrol\nin the context of selfish temptation, can be blamed and punished, and are expected to care for\nmoral patients. Moral patients are high in experience, including especially the capacity to feel pain. Both\nmoral agents and patients have moral worth. But as in all entities that have worth or value, some are more\nvaluable than others. So it is with moral worth. This is where departures from humanness get interesting,\ndangerously so. When we strip individuals of their moral worth, denying them qualities that define\nhumanness, we have entered a world of distortion and denial that facilitates and justifies excessive harms.\nAcross many studies, individuals consider themselves to be more human ⎯⎯ as defined by the\ndimensions of experience and agency ⎯⎯ and to have greater moral worth than other individuals. When\nindividuals are socially ostracized and excluded from a group, they judge themselves as less human, and\nso do the spectators who observe the ostracism. Individuals judge members of their own group to be more\nhuman and morally worthy than those outside the group, no matter how small or broad the group is. What\ncounts is our overall sense of how we compare to others, and the dimensions used to calibrate this\nsimilarity metric. The Australian social psychologist Nick Haslam carried out several experiments to\ndetermine how our rating of a group’s humanness influenced how much we praise, blame and protect\nthem, as well as whether we believe that rehabilitation or punishment is most appropriate after they have\ndone something wrong. Haslam based his study on the idea, supported by the law, science, and our folk\nintuitions that we blame, praise and punish only those who do bad things on purpose as opposed to by\naccident. Conversely, we favor rehabilitation in those cases where we believe that the person can right a\nwrong, learning a lesson from a prior transgression.\nSubjects started by rating several different social groups along different dimensions of\nhumanness. Though Haslam’s dimensions were slightly different from those used by Gray and Wegner,\nthey generally corresponded to experience and agency, including compassion, warmth and a sense of\ncommunity on the one hand, and reason, self-control, civility, and refinement on the other. The target\nsocial groups were associated with negative or positive stereotypes such as the homeless, mentally\ndisabled, athletes, politicians, doctors, lawyers, gays, and different religious groups. Next subjects\nimagined that a member of one of these groups had acted morally or immorally, or had been mistreated in\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 91\nsome way. Then they decided whether the person should be praised for a particular moral act such as\nreturning a wallet, considered responsible for an immoral act such as breaking a promise, helped out for\nmistreatment such as being pushed out of line by a person in a hurry, and punished or rehabilitated for\nwrongful behavior.\nHaslam’s results generated a landscape of humanness very much like Gray and Wegner’s. Those\ngroups rated highly in terms of agency, were more likely to be blamed and punished. Those groups rated\nhigh in experience were more likely to be praised, protected, and placed into rehabilitation. Those groups\nperceived as more emotional, compassionate and warm ⎯⎯ components of experience ⎯⎯ were praised\nmore, whereas those perceived as more civil and rational ⎯⎯ components of agency ⎯⎯ were praised less.\nOverall, the more a group tilts toward the experience end of the spectrum, the more we see them as moral\npatients, deserving of our care and compassion. The more a group tilts toward the agency end of the\nspectrum, the more we see them as moral agents, having responsibilities and duties to act morally.\nHaslam’s findings are not only of great conceptual interest, shaping our understanding of the\ndefining qualities of being human, but also figure into everyday political and legal decision making.\nWhen do we believe a person has the right to vote, drive responsibly, drink alcohol reasonably, and serve\nan adult as opposed to a youth sentence for a crime? In the United States, the age cut off for considering\nthe punishment of a crime under the jurisdiction of a juvenile court proceeding ranges from 16-19 years.\nJuvenile sentences are lighter than adult sentences, and rarely include life in prison or the death penalty.\nThough there is an arbitrariness to these age cut offs, and no good reason why states should differ, the\ndecision to treat youths differently not only maps on to our intuitions but to the attributes that\npsychologists such as Haslam, Gray and Wegner have discovered. Treating an individual as a youth is\nmore likely to trigger the dimension of experience in jury members and thus, more likely to trigger a\nsense that the individual should be protected and given the opportunity to change through rehabilitation.\nThis fits with scientific evidence that an immature brain is a more plastic brain, capable of change. It also\nfits with the evidence that an immature brain is a brain with less self-control and critical reasoning ⎯⎯\nboth components of the agency dimension. These less than fully human qualities on the agency\ndimension, balanced by more qualities on the experience dimension, provide youths with an automatic\nentry ticket into the arena of moral patients.\nMoving outside of the arena of moral patienthood and into that of moral agency requires a change\nin perception. It requires us to see individuals as acting responsibly, controlling temptation, and\nunderstanding the distinction between right and wrong. It is for these reasons that our legal system, and\nthe courts that carry out its principles, must consider psychological differences. Classifying individuals\nas adults or juveniles drags with it a massive psychology that is biased toward responsibility, blame and\npunishment on the one hand and protection, intervention, and rehabilitation on the other. The same biases\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 92\nare also engaged when we consider adults with developmental disorders or brain injury, as these deficits\nare often associated with selective loss of either components of agency or experience, and sometimes\nboth. As demonstrated by the work of Kurt Gray, Andres Martinez, and others, labeling someone a\npsychopath, autistic, or schizophrenic effectively pigeon holes the individual into a class of individuals\nwith less than fully human qualities. This is a good thing when it focuses us on protection, intervention\nand rehabilitation. It is a bad thing when it allows us to morally disengage because those lacking the full\ncompliment of qualities associated with agency and experience are less morally worthy. Humanness\ndrives our moral concerns and our sense of others’ moral worth. When we lower our sense of another’s\nvalue, we are willing to violate our sense of the sacred, engaging in trade-offs that are normally taboo.\nExperiments by the American psychologists Philip Tetlock and Jonathan Haidt help us see what\nis sacred by asking individuals what they would pay to do something sacrilegious. If something is sacred,\nof great moral worth either personally or to your group, could you be paid off by a wealthy investor to\ngive up the object or engage in an act against it? For each of the acts below, think about your payoff\npoint in dollars from $0 (for free) to $1million, including the option of saying that you would never do it\nfor any amount of money. Keep in mind that if you choose to carry out an act and receive payment you\nwill not suffer any consequences:\n• Kick a dog in the head, hard.\n• Sign a secret but binding pledge to hire only people of your race into your company\n• Burn your country’s flag in private\n• Throw a rotten tomato at a political leader that you dislike.\n• Get a one pint transfusion of disease-free, compatible blood from a convicted child molester.\nIf you are like the subjects in these experiments, the mere process of considering a payoff, even\nfor a short period of time, will have turned your stomach into knots and triggered a deep sense of disgust.\nThis is because violating the sacred is akin to violating our sense of humanness. It is playing with the\ndevil, accepting a Faustian offer of money to strip something of its moral worth. As Haidt notes, even\nthough it is sacrilege to accept payment across different moral concerns, including avoiding harm, acting\nfairly, and respecting authority, different experiences can modulate the aversion we feel when we imagine\nsuch transgressions. Women typically demand more money for each of these acts than men, and more\noften reject them as taboo. Those who lean toward the conservative end of the political spectrum either\nask for more money or consider the act taboo when compared to liberals, and this was especially the case\nfor questions focused on acting against an in-group (race), an authority figure (political leader), or ones\npurity (blood transfusion). What this shows is that our cultural experiences can distort what we consider\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 93\nmorally worthy or sacred. It shows how easily we can flip our values in the face of tempting alternatives.\nThe scientific evidence presented in this section shows that our decisions to treat others according\nto different moral principles or norms is powerfully affected by our sense of what counts as another\nhuman being. What counts includes at least two important dimensions, one focused on agency and the\nother on experience. These dimensions determine whether we blame or praise someone, punish or\nrehabilitate them, and ultimately, include or exclude them from the inner circles of moral agents or moral\npatients. Those who fall outside these two inner circles are morally worthless. Those who are morally\nworthless can be destroyed or banished. Some things are justifiably excluded and fit with our general\nsense of reality ⎯⎯ rocks, dirt, cardboard boxes, plastic balls, and pieces of glass. Other things are\nexcluded because they don’t fit with our values of what reality should be. This is where distortion and\ndenial enter the process. This is where we create walls around members of one group in order to keep\nothers out. This is where we express partiality instead of the impartiality that Lady Justice champions\nwith her two balanced scales and blind fold-covered eyes. This is where we exclude others from our inner\nsanctum in order to justify great harms. How is the inner sanctum set up and put into action over a\nlifetime, sometimes for legitimate causes and sometimes for illegitimate and unconscionable causes?\nPopulating the inner sanctum\nElie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Laureate and Holocaust survivor, remarked that “anti-Semitism is the most\nancient form of prejudice.” This claim may well be true of human written history, but is most definitely\nfalse if one considers the fact that all social animals and human societies, including the hunter-gatherer\ngroups that are descendants of people that predated the Jews, hate some individuals and love others.\nPrejudice, though often based on deep seated ideological biases and stereotypes that humans invent, is, at\nroot, a form of partiality. Every social animal, either extinct or alive today, expresses partiality. This is a\nhighly adaptive and ancient psychology, promoting the care of young, investment in mates, and escape\nstrategies against enemies. Humans are no different, except for the role that our promiscuous brains play\nin fueling partiality with ideology and symbolism. Sometimes when we express our partiality it is for the\nnoble cause of caring for our children and for defending ideological beliefs surrounding humanitarian\ncauses, including defense of basic human rights. Sometimes when we express our partiality, it is for the\nignoble cause of destroying others. How does human partiality begin? Do babies express preferences for\ncertain social categories? How does their experience sculpt new categories? How is the inner sanctum\npopulated, enabling us to preferentially help those within and harm those outside?\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 94\nAt birth, newborns preferentially listen to their native language over a non-native language. Soon\nthereafter, infants prefer to listen to their native dialect over a non-native dialect, and look longer at their\nown race than another race. This shows that they can discriminate between different languages, dialects,\nand racial groups. But do they form social preferences based on these distinctions? Would a young baby\nor child prefer to take a toy from an unfamiliar person who speaks the same or different language, from\nthe same or different race? To answer these questions, the American psychologist Katharine Kinzler put 5\nmonths old babies to a test.\nBabies born into mono-racial and mono-lingual families sat on their mother’s lap in front of two\nmonitors, each presenting short video clips of different people. After watching the videos, Kinzler\ncreated a bit of magic. The people in the monitor appeared to emerge from the 2D image and offer the\nbaby a toy. The trick: a real person, hidden beneath the monitor, synchronized her reach with the reach in\nthe monitor. Who would the baby choose given that both people offered the same toy? Babies preferred\npeople speaking the native over non-native language, and native-accent over the non-native accent. At\nthis young age, however, they showed no preference for native over non-native race. Thus, early in life\nthe connection between discrimination and social preference is well established for language, but not race.\nWhen do things change for race?\nKinzler carried out another series of experiments on race with one group of 2.5 year old children\nand a second group of 5-year olds. Though the methods were somewhat different, they both focused on\nthe child’s preferences, including who they would share toys with and who they would prefer as friends.\nThe 2.5 year olds showed no preferences, whereas the 5 year olds preferred their own race. Race is\ntherefore a slowly developing category, at least in terms of its impact on social preferences, and especially\nwhen contrasted with both language and accent.\nKinzler took these studies one step further to explore whether there is anything like a hierarchy\namong these social categories and the features that define them. What’s more important to a young child\nbuilding an inner sanctum of trusted others ⎯⎯race, language, or dialect? Would they rather interact with\nsomeone of the same race who speaks a foreign language or someone of a different race who speaks the\nnative language? Using similar procedures, Kinzler showed that by 4-5 years of age, language trumps\nrace. Children would rather interact with someone from a different race speaking the same language than\nsomeone of the same race speaking a foreign language.\nWhy would language trump race? Kinzler's answer relies on an idea developed by the American\nevolutionary psychologist Robert Kurzban. Imagine a hunter-gatherer in South Africa, living during the\nearliest stages of our evolutionary history. As individuals searched for food to eat, areas to sleep, water to\ndrink, and places to avoid, they came across other individuals. These individuals were always members\nof the same race. Racial differences did not emerge until relatively late in human evolution, well after our\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 95\nancestors took their first steps out of Africa. If we are thinking about an evolved psychology for bonding\nwith members of our own group and fighting those outside, our ancestors would have been blind to race\nas it was not yet an emergent property of our species. Language was, however, a property of our species,\nand one that varied across populations. A hunter-gatherer walking the plains of South Africa would\nindeed have run into people speaking either a completely different language, or the same language with a\ndifferent dialect. New languages are not easily acquired, and nor are new dialects. It takes real talent to\nspeak a new language or dialect without a trace of ones origins. Thus, like the stotting gazelles,\nmagnanimous spenders, and healthy evildoers discussed in chapter 2, the native languages and dialects we\nspeak are honest signals of social group membership. Honesty is supported by the costs we pay to\nacquire them. Cheating is hard because there is a start-up cost associated with perfecting the natural\nrhythm of a second language or novel dialect.\nThe babies in Kinzler’s experiments tell us something important: race and language are both\nimportant social categories and discriminable from an early age. But language trumps race as a feature\nbecause it is a better predictor of membership within the inner sanctum, at least early in life. Ultimately,\nboth language and race allow us to close off some from the inner sanctum and allow others in. Ultimately,\nour allegiance to our native language and race can fuel our hatred toward those who look different and\nspeak in different tongues.\nClosed doors\nAs adults, we tend to rely on rules of thumb to guide our social interactions, including who we trust and\nwho we distrust. We tend to trust those we know more than those we don’t know. Within the circle of\nthose we know, we believe those who are more like us than those who are unlike us, using fixed body\nfeatures ⎯⎯ race, height, hair color ⎯⎯ flexible psychological features ⎯⎯ food preferences, sports’\ninterests, religious beliefs ⎯⎯ and features that are flexibly constrained ⎯⎯ language and intelligence.\nTogether, these different dimensions cause us to close the door on some and open it to others.\nLanguage is particularly interesting. If you can’t understand someone because they don’t speak\nyour language or because their accent is too heavy, then the issue is not trust, but comprehension. But\nwhat if you can understand the person perfectly well, but they speak with a foreign accent, either one\nfrom a different country (e.g., a French speaker speaking English) or one from the same country but a\ndifferent region (e.g., a Southern accent in the northeast of the United States)?\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 96\nSubjects in an experiment first listened to people reading trivia, such as “A giraffe can go without\nwater longer than a camel can,” and then judged whether the sentence was true or false. If the sentence\nwas read in a foreign accent, subjects were more likely to say that it was false than if it was read in the\nnative accent. Subjects voiced this opinion even though the experimenter told them that the reader was\nnot expressing an opinion, but merely reading the passage as instructed. In a second experiment, British\nsubjects listening to a non-guilty plea by a person on trial were more likely to judge the person as guilty if\nhe committed a blue collar crime and spoke with a non-standard British accent (e.g., Australian). In\ncontrast, they were more likely to judge a white collar criminal as guilty if he spoke with a standard\nBritish accent. Even within the class of British accents, biases emerged: subjects from the Worcester\nregion were more likely to judge supposed criminals as guilty if they spoke with a Birmingham accent\nthan with a Worcester accent. Together, these studies paint a bleak picture: accents from an out-group are\nperceived as less truthful than others, and in the context of a criminal case, more guilty as well.\nAccents are learned early in life, and once in place, are both clear markers of your origins and\ndifficult to undue. As such, they are honest indicators of at least one dimension of group membership.\nWhat about dimensions that can readily be acquired at any point in life, and just as easily dropped? How\ndo these influence not only our perception of those who share these dimensions in common, but how we\ntreat them? In the last chapter I discussed a study by Tania Singer in which both men and women showed\nmore pain empathy ⎯⎯ as revealed by activation in the insula region of the brain ⎯⎯ when they watched a\ncooperator experiencing pain. Further, men showed a reduction of activity in this area when a cheater\nexperienced pain, and increased activity in a reward area ⎯⎯ the nucleus accumbens. This pattern fits well\nwith the research on human and nonhuman animals showing that winning, and watching winners win,\ntriggers a choreographed ballet of physiological responses associated with reward. Singer took this work\nfurther, asking whether an individual’s support for a sport’s team might similarly modulate both the\nfeeling of pain empathy as well as reward. Subjects, all soccer fanatics, sat in a scanner and watched as a\nplayer from their favorite team or a rival experienced pain. Next, Singer provided subjects with three\noptions for interacting with these players: help them by personally taking on some of the pain they would\nreceive, letting them take on all the pain but watch a video as distraction, or let them take on all the pain\nand watch as it happens. Option one is costly altruism, two is blissful ignorance, and three is\nschadenfreude.\nIn parallel with the earlier work on fairness, here too Singer observed greater pain empathy when\nthe favorite team player experienced pain than when the rival experienced pain. She also observed that\nsubjects were more likely to help favorite team players by taking on some of their pain, but more likely to\nwatch rivals receive pain. The higher the activation level in the insula, the more they took on their\nfavorite team player’s pain session ⎯⎯ the more they helped. When they watched rivals experience pain,\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 97\nthere was significant activation in the nucleus accumbens. They felt an immediate honey hit, joy over the\nrival’s pain. The higher the activation in this reward area, the more likely they were to choose the option\nof watching the rival experience pain ⎯⎯ like watching a public execution and cheering for just deserts.\nThese results show that individual differences in our compassion toward others in pain predicts our\nwillingness to help them. It reveals another dimension, like language, that biases our sense of justice, both\nin our judgments and in our behavior. Conversely, individual differences in our joy over others’ misery\npredicts our willingness to allow others to suffer, suppress our instincts to help and, I suggest, facilitate\nour capacity to harm. Similar response patterns arise in the context of race ⎯⎯ a feature of group\nmembership that is fixed at birth.\nAs noted earlier, babies stare longer at faces of people from the same race than from people of a\ndifferent race, and by the pre-school years, are more likely to show social preferences for peers and adults\nof the same race. In brain imaging studies, specific areas activate when we process faces as opposed to\nother objects, and one tenth of a second later, other associated regions activate when we process race.\nThis rapid activation occurs whether we are consciously engaged in classifying faces by race or not; for\nexample, the same areas activate even when we are forced to focus on gender or familiarity. This shows\nthat from the brain’s perspective, we don’t have an option of processing a person’s race. The brain\nautomatically and unconsciously hands us this information, like it or not.\nThe fact that we process race automatically gains importance based on a powerful set of\nbehavioral studies showing that virtually every person, independently of their explicit avowals of nonracist\nattitudes, holds implicit or unconscious racist biases. Using a research tool developed by the social\npsychologists Tony Greenwald and Mahzarin Banaji called the Implicit Attitudes Test or IAT, subjects see\ndifferent faces or read different descriptions of people, and then make evaluative judgments about these\npeople. Often, the presentations are rapid so that there is little or no time to reflect upon the evaluation.\nFor example, in a study focused on race, subjects first classified photographs of people’s faces as either\nCaucasian or Black. Next they classified words into those associated with good positive meaning ⎯⎯ joy\nand friend ⎯⎯ and those with bad negative meaning ⎯⎯ hate and bomb. In the third and critical step,\nsubjects saw faces and words together and, using a rule provided by the experimenter, struck one of two\nkeys on a keyboard as fast as possible: for example, strike the #1 key if you see a Black face and a good\nword, but the #2 key if you see a Caucasian face and a good word. The intuition here is that if certain\nfaces and words are more strongly associated, because this is what people have learned over time, then\nthey will press the relevant key faster than for weaker associations. Results from several studies confirm\nthis intuition. For example, Caucasian subjects who explicitly deny racist attitudes are nonetheless slower\nto respond when Black, as opposed to Caucasian faces are associated with good words, and faster to\nrespond when Black, as opposed to Caucasian faces are associated with bad words. These patterns hold\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 98\neven when subjects respond to names commonly associated with Caucasian and Black people. A quick\nskim through the many blogs commenting on this work reveals a common refrain that makes the key\npoint: many that have taken this test, whether focusing on race, sexual orientation, or political affiliation,\nopine that the test must be invalid because they explicitly disavow any groupish biases. But that’s the\npoint! What we disavow explicitly has less impact than we would like on what we hold implicitly.\nIf our implicit system champions one view of racism and our explicit system another, then we are\ncontinuously faced with an epic conflict. To resolve this conflict, and enable the explicit system to emerge\ntriumphant, requires self-control, keeping the implicit system quiet. Studies of the brain provide\ninteresting insights into this process. Recall that when we experience conflict, regardless of its content,\nthere is activation in the anterior cingulate. When we exert self-control, regardless of content, there is\nactivation in particular regions within the prefrontal cortex. When we feel threatened by a dangerous\nanimal or person, there is activation in the amygdala. These three brain regions tell an interesting story\nabout how we process race. When Caucasian subjects view faces of Black as opposed to Caucasian\npeople staring at them, there is greater activation in the amygdala. This racial difference disappears if\nsubjects view photos of faces looking away or with eyes closed. It is the potentially threatening aspect of\na face staring at you that engages the racial difference. If you briefly flash faces at Caucasian subjects so\nthat they are unaware of them, there is stronger activation in the amygdala for Black than Caucasian\nfaces. But if you present the faces for long enough, allowing them to enter conscious awareness, the\namygdala’s pattern of activity goes away, replaced instead by strong activation in the anterior cingulate\nand prefrontal cortex. Staring longer at someone from a different race triggers a sense of conflict and\nengages the system of self-control, pushing down our implicit racism to enable more explicit neutrality\nand equality.\nWhat this work shows is that understanding our attitudes and actions toward those of the same\nand different race requires consideration of implicit and explicit components. Think of this process like a\nhand pushing down on an automatic watering fountain. The machinery that produces the pressure to push\nwater out of the holes in the fountain operates without concern for what happens outside in the world. The\nhand that pushes down is under human control, consciously guided, perhaps with the aim of simply\nspreading the water or feeling its’ coolness on a hot day. Though the hand may try to control the\nmovement of the water, it may only do so to some extent, guided by the power of the automatic engine\nbelow. Thus, we have an automatic bottom up mechanism and a controlled top down mechanism. So it is\nwith race. The bottom up mechanism operates automatically, pushing forward our implicit prejudice. The\ntop down mechanism attempts to exert control, when and where it can, to avoid looking racist, sexist, or\nwhat have you. Somewhere, the two meet, creating a personality profile that is more explicitly racist,\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 99\nsexist, or X-ist in some cases than others, either because the individual lacks top down control or because\nthey decide to relinquish it.\nIn parallel with Singer’s work on the relationship between pain empathy and our classification of\nothers as fair-minded cooperators or narcissistically-minded cheaters, so too does race influence our\nexpression of compassion toward those in pain. Both Caucasian, Black and Asian subjects showed\nstronger activation in the pain-related areas of the brain when viewing individuals from the same race\nexperience pain than when viewing individuals of a different race. When Black subjects played a\ncomputerized game involving social ostracism, they showed stronger activation in areas of the brain\ninvolved in social pain when excluded by Caucasian players than when excluded by Black players. When\nothers suffer and we have the opportunity to help them, we are more likely to help those of the same race,\nand feel good about it as evidenced by activation of brain areas involved in reward.\nOur biases, both implicit and explicit, influence our compassion toward others and our motivation\nto help. This statement is true whether we are looking at evidence from young children or adults, and\nusing measures that assess sensory perception, behavioral judgment, or activity patterns in the brain.\nBeginning with an evolutionarily ancient brain system that was designed to distinguish friendly ingroup\nmembers and antagonistic outgroup members, we populate the inner sanctum with people who we\nperceive as most like us, using both fixed and variable features. With time, the walls surrounding this\nsanctum close, attributing the full richness of human nature to those within, and bleaching it from those\noutside.\nBleaching humanity\nDraw an imaginary circle around yourself with a diameter of about fifty feet. Now imagine packing this\ncircle with people, forming an expanding set of concentric circles that radiates out from those closest to\nyou to those you don’t know at all. Based on social network analyses by sociologists such as Nicholas\nChristakis, the majority of people within the inner circles will be like you in a number of ways, including\ntheir race, religion, political affiliation, food preferences, and aesthetics. This includes family members\nand close friends, but also those we work with, vote for, and play with. As you travel from the inner core\nto the outside, you will find less in common. Some in the outer core will not only have less in common,\nbut as noted earlier in this chapter based on work by Gray, Wegner and Haslam, will be perceived as less\nhuman, stripped of dimensions of experience and agency that define humanity. Some will appear like\nobjects, others like animals. When we transform others into objects, we have stripped away core aspects\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 100\nof human nature, including emotional sensitivity, warmth, and flexibility. When we transform others into\nanimals, we have stripped them of uniquely human qualities such as rationality, self-control, moral\nsensibility, and civility. Of those who are like animals, some will seem like kin to the domesticated form\nand thus controllable as property; others will seem like wild animals and thus dangerous, dirty and\ndeserving of elimination. However we engage this process, we have bleached individuals of their\nhumanity. This process, one that occurs in both everyday life and in cases of conflict, has allowed us to\ntreat the mentally and physically disabled like animals, to consider women as sexual property, justify\nslavery and slave wages, deny certain races the opportunity to vote and receive education, and mandate\nethnic cleansing.\nBefore I describe a shocking set of experimental findings on dehumanization, consider first a\nsnapshot into some of our historical attitudes, shared across many countries and cultures. Before we\nknew much about human evolution and the causes of variation, scientists made sweeping statements\nabout the relationship between brain structure and differences in intelligence and behavior among men,\nwomen and the variety of races. It was commonly believed that, compared with white men, women and\nall other races had smaller brains, approximating our cousins the apes. Listen to Gustave LeBon, a\ndistinguished social psychologist, writing in 1879:\nIn the most intelligent races, as among the Parisians, there are a large\nnumber of women whose brains are closer in size to those of gorillas\nthan to the most developed male brains. This inferiority is so obvious\nthat no one can contest it for a moment; only its degree is worth\ndiscussion. All psychologists who have studied the intelligence of\nwomen, as well as poets and novelists, recognize today that they\nrepresent the most inferior forms of human evolution and that they are\ncloser to children and savages than to an adult, civilized man. They\nexcel in fickleness, inconstancy, absence of thought and logic, and\nincapacity to reason. Without doubt there exist some distinguished\nwomen, very superior to the average man, but they are as exceptional as\nthe birth of any monstrosity, as, for example, of a gorilla with two heads;\nconsequently, we may neglect them entirely.\nBy elevating white men to the gold standard of perfection, it was easy to see everyone else as a\ndegenerate form of God’s creation or, in biological terms, of arrested evolution, with non-Caucasian races\nshowing greater affinity to our furry cousins the apes. Looked at today, backed by our understanding of\ngenetics and the evolutionary process, these accounts are absurd and offensive. Sadly, despite efforts to\nclean up our explicit racist and sexist attitudes, overwhelming evidence reveals that the brain holds dear a\nsuite of unconscious prejudices that serve to dehumanize those unlike us.\nNow the shocking experiments. The American social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt dared to\nask whether US citizens unconsciously associate Black people with imagery ofd apes, using the\ndisturbing history of this association as her jumping off point. In parallel with the studies of race\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 101\npresented in the last section, Eberhardt was also interested in the possibility that if people carry this\nassociation around in their head, they do so unconsciously, despite explicit avowals that they are not at all\nracist. And if they carry this association around unconsciously, how does it impact upon their judgments\nand actions?\nIn one experiment with both Caucasian and non-Caucasian subjects, Eberhardt used a technique\ncalled subliminal priming. Subliminal priming involves rapidly presenting pictures, sounds or other\nexperiences under the radar of awareness and then presenting material that falls within our radar. If the\ntwo experiences are similar, the unconscious version affects subjects’ perception of the conscious one.\nFor example, if you first prime people by flashing the picture of a woman’s face, subjects then respond\nfaster to faces of women than to faces of men. In other words, despite the fact that subjects are unaware of\nthe prime, it affects their judgments. Eberhardt first primed subjects with photographed faces of\nCaucasian or Black people or an unrecognizable non-face. They then watched a short movie that started\noff with an unrecognizable object that looked like it was covered by dense snow. As the movie\nprogressed, the snow lifted, making it easier to recognize the object as a line drawing of either a duck,\ndolphin, alligator, squirrel or ape. Subjects stopped the movie as soon as they recognized the animal.\nCompared with Caucasian faces and non-faces, priming with Black faces caused subjects to stop\nthe movie much sooner for apes, but not for any other animal. Compared with non-faces, priming with\nCaucasian faces caused subjects to stop the movie much later for apes, but not for any other animal. This\nsuggests that Black faces made it easier to identify apes, whereas Caucasian faces made it harder to\nidentify apes, with no comparable effects for any other animals. Caucasian and non-Caucasian subjects\nshowed the same pattern of response, and so too did individuals with and without strong, explicit racial\nattitudes. Although the similarity among Caucasian and non-Caucasian subjects is of interest, and\nsuggests that the association is held even among those who were perhaps less strongly associated with\nthis form of dehumanization, there were relatively few Black subjects in this non-Caucasian group. This\nfirst set of experiments suggests, therefore, that among a racially heterogeneous group of educated\nStanford undergraduates, individuals carry an unconscious association between Black people and apes,\nand thus, an unconsciously dehumanized representation of another human being. Given the animal form\nof this dehumanization, the implication from Haslam’s work is that Caucasians associate Blacks with less\nrationality, civility, and self-control, in essence, less uniquely human qualities.\nThese are remarkable and disturbing findings. They can’t be explained by some superficial\nsimilarity between human faces and animals because Eberhardt found the same results when she\npresented either line drawings or words of animals. Had Eberhardt used actual photographs of animals,\nsubjects could have used similarity in skin color or nose shape ⎯⎯ for example, seeing a black human face\nwould prime seeing a black ape face because both have the color black in common. Line drawings and\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 102\nwritten words cut the legs out of this account. Eberhardt’s results suggest that apes are associated with the\nsocio-cultural, racial category “Black.”\nThese findings reveal a deep seated, dehumanized representation that is readily triggered even in\nhighly educated people. But perhaps they are less disturbing then we might imagine. not so bad if the\ntake home message is that we are closet racists with antiquated theories of evolution or God’s design.\nOutside of these artificial studies, we are well educated citizens who keep our isms tucked away, locked\nup in our unconscious. Unfortunately, the unsettling feelings that many will have to these studies are\nexacerbated by an additional set of results collected by Eberhardt, linking unconscious impressions to\nharmful actions. Caucasian male subjects watched a video of a policeman using force to subdue a suspect\nwho was either Black or Caucasian. When primed with an ape drawing, but not that of a tiger, subjects\nwere more likely to say that the policeman was justified in subduing the Black suspect than the Caucasian\nsuspect. We are more than closet racists. We are out of the closet, armed for prejudice and\ndehumanization.\nTo unconsciously think that Blacks are more like apes than other racial groups is to strip them of\ncharacteristics that are uniquely human. As Haslam notes, when we dehumanize others in this particular\nway, we no longer see them as human, but as incompetent wild animals or immature children lacking in\nintelligence, etiquette, rationality, and moral wherewithal. This mode of dehumanization is ancient,\nreflected in the writings and paintings of European explorers who encountered indigenous cultures in\nAsia, Australia, and Africa. Dehumanizing others into objects is equally ancient, unflattering and\ndangerous. In one study, American adults were told to focus on either the physical appearance or\npersonality of the actress Angelina Jolie and the ex-governor of Alaska and presidential hopeful Sarah\nPalin ⎯⎯ both famous personalities within the United States. When subjects focused on appearance as\nopposed to personality, they judged both Jolie and Palin as relatively lacking in traits of experience or\nhuman nature. Jolie and Palin were seen as objects. In other studies, carried out by Haslam, subjects\njudged objectified men and women as less capable of suffering and less deserving of moral compassion\nand protection, reinforcing the age old attitude we once held toward slaves, and that many hold today\ntoward prostitutes. When people become property, they fall outside of the circle of moral patients. Studies\nof the brain provide further support for these dehumanizing transformations, and highlight, once again,\nboth the beneficial and malignant consequences of our mind’s promiscuity.\nBrains without borders\nDehumanization enables doctors to treat their patients ⎯⎯ human or nonhuman animal ⎯⎯ as mechanical\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 103\ndevices that require repair. This allows for cool-headed, rational, and skillful surgeries, while fending off\nthe humanizing emotions of compassion and empathy. This is adaptive. This is a transformation that\nenables doctors working in war-torn areas or regions afflicted with a disease outbreak, to treat hundreds\nof suffering patients as if they were treating inert cars on an assembly line. Good doctors allow their\ncompassion and empathy to return as their patients regain awareness. Bad doctors maintain their cool,\ndetached manner, insensitive to the physical and psychological pain of their waking patients. Bad doctors\ncontinue to perceive their patients like cars on the assembly line. Really bad doctors see their patients like\ncars that were created for personal R&D.\nRecall from earlier sections that when we see someone else in pain, particular areas of the brain\nactivate as we imagine their suffering. Many of the same areas of the brain also activate when we\npersonally experience pain. This is the circuitry for pain empathy. The French cognitive neuroscientist\nJean Decety showed that when physicians look at video clips of people experiencing pain from a needle\nprick, this circuit is suppressed relative to non-physicians. For physicians, it’s as if they were watching a\nneedle prick a pillow. Though we don’t know how much experience was necessary or sufficient to cause\nthe physician’s lack of pain empathy, or the extent to which physicians are physicians because they were\nborn with less empathy, Decety’s findings point to individual differences in our capacity to feel what\nothers feel and the potential modulating role of experience.\nSeveral studies now show that based on individual experience, the human brain readily flip-flops\nbetween empathy and callousness. In two similarly designed experiments, one recording from pain related\nareas in the brain, and the other from a motor area associated with the hand, Caucasian and Black subjects\nwatched a video of a needle penetrating a human hand. Consistently, subjects showed weaker activation\nin the pain and motor areas when watching the needle penetrate the hand from another race. This lowering\nof pain empathy and motor response for the out-group was greatest for subjects with the highest implicit\nor unconscious racial biases, as measured with the IAT tool noted earlier.\nThese studies of the brain, like the behavioral studies I discussed earlier, add to the idea that we\nhave a racial bias for pain empathy. We feel others’ pain, but only for those who share the same race. But\nsince, by definition, we look more like those from within our racial group than those outside it, perhaps\nthe bias is less about race and more about those that don’t look like us. To explore this possibility, Black\nand Caucasian subjects saw a needle penetrate a violet-colored hand. Violet hands are not only different,\nbut far more different than either black or white hands in terms of our experience of skin coloration.\nNonetheless, the activation pattern in the brain matched the subject’s own race. When we feel less\ncompassion for someone of another race, it is because of racial biases, not because of superficial\ndifferences in appearance. Color is simply a cue that reminds us of our prejudice.\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 104\nThe fact that we feel less empathy for people in pain if they fall outside our inner sanctum\nsuggests that we have dehumanized them, stripping away dimensions of experience that humanize those\nwithin the sanctum. These are the dimensions associated with emotion, and when taken away, cause us to\nperceive the other as an object. Since objects can’t feel pain or joy, we can’t share in their experience\nbecause they lack experience altogether. If that is the case, then when we perceive any human group that\nhas been dehumanized in this particular way, there should be little to no activity in those areas of the brain\nassociated with thinking, feeling, wanting, and believing. To explore this possibility, the social\npsychologist Susan Fiske placed subjects in a brain scanner and presented photographs of either extreme\nout-group members, such as the homeless and drug addicts, or photographs of other groups such as the\nelderly, middle-class Americans, and the rich. When viewing the extreme out-group, not only did Fiske\nsee little activity in an area critically related to self-awareness and the process of thinking about others\nthoughts and emotions ⎯⎯ the medial prefrontal cortex ⎯⎯ but she also observed an intense increase of\nactivity in the insula, a brain area that is recruited when we experience disgust.\nFiske’s results highlight the dangers of dehumanization. Once we turn off areas of the brain that\nare involved in thinking about others’ thoughts and emotions, and turn on areas involved in disgust, we\nhave set ourselves up for moral disengagement. As the distinguished American psychologist Albert\nBandura has documented through decades of research, moral disengagement allows people to justify harm\nby transforming lethal motives into morally justified and even benevolent ones. Moral disengagement\nallows us to excuse ourselves from moral responsibility, either disregarding the harm imposed or\nconvincing ourselves that it was justified, even obligatory. In several international studies of school-aged\nchildren, results consistently show that those who are most morally disengaged are most likely to engage\nin various forms of aggression, including bullying and repeated criminal offenses. These same children\nare also least likely to engage in helpful behavior, revealing that moral disengagement dispenses with the\ntypical process of self-censure and sanctioning that we carry around when we are morally engaged. In a\nstudy of American prison personnel involved in death penalty sentences, executioners were more morally\ndisengaged than support staff or prison guards. Executioners were more likely to dehumanize the\nconvicted prisoner and provide moral and economic justifications. Executioners also felt less guilt\nbecause they had developed a narrative to justify their actions, one that ascribed complete fault and\nresponsibility to the victim. Support staff flipped in the opposite direction, fully involved with the\nweighty moral issues associated with ending someone’s life. In a study of people’s political attitudes,\nthose with strong right wing authoritarian views, commonly associated with fascism and submission to\nauthority, were more likely to support war by means of morally disengaging. In particular, they were most\nlikely to support war by justifying its necessity and trivializing the harm that will necessarily arise ⎯⎯ for\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 105\nexample, invading another country is not aggressive, but designed as a pre-emptive strike to protect group\ninterests.\nMoral disengagement enables behaviors that are either immoral, illegal, or counter to deeply\nrooted intuitive prohibitions against harming others. It is a process that has the beneficial consequence of\nempowering soldiers to go to war under just causes, as well as the toxic consequence of empowering\nrogue leaders to carry out genocide under unjust causes. It is a process that allows us to hibernate from\nour moral responsibilities. It is a form of self-deception, a partner to dehumanization in the denial of\nreality. But self-deception, like deception of others, is not always harmful. In fact, it is often highly\nadaptive.\nAngelic denial\nIn a nationally televised address in 2005, the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pronounced that\nthe Jews had \"created a myth in the name of the Holocaust and consider it above God, religion and the\nprophets.\" Judge Daniel Schreber believed that his brain was softening and that he was turning into a\nwoman in order to form a sexual union with God. During a doctor’s visit, a man reported that his pet\npoodle had been replaced by an impostor, masquerading as if he was the real deal. Judge Patrick\nCouwenberg stated under oath that he received the Purple Heart for military operations in Vietnam, and\nsoon thereafter carried out covert missions in Southeast Asia and Africa as a CIA agent. The pilots of Air\nFlorida flight 90 ignored signs from their dashboard indicating engine trouble and then proceeded to crash\ninto a bridge, killing 74 of the 79 people on board. In 2008, while Hilary Clinton was running for\nPresident of the United States, she regaled admiring supporters with stories of her international\nexperience, including her visit to Bosnia in 1996 where her plane was forced to land “under sniper fire”,\nfollowed by a rapid evacuation for cover. When I was a teenager, I often walked onto the tennis court\nthinking that I was John McEnroe, serving and volleying like the world’s number one player.\nEach case above tells the story of a person who acted as if the world was one way even though it\nwasn’t. The Holocaust and its trail of atrocities were real, confirmed by thousands of scarred survivors\nand the relatives who have heard their accounts. Judge Couwenberg was never in Vietnam, never earned a\nPurple Heart, and never had a connection with the CIA. There are no pet poodle impostors. Our brains\ndon’t soften, though they do deteriorate with age. When dashboard indicators suggest engine trouble,\nbetter to be safe than sorry when you are responsible for the lives of many people. Hilary Clinton landed\nin the exceptionally safe airport of Tuzla where she was warmly greeted by US and Bosnian officials. I\nam no McEnroe.\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 106\nIn each of these cases, there was a mismatch with reality. The person harbored a false belief, but\nbelieved it was true. In some cases, the mismatch was due to psychosis, some kind of delusion or\nmalfunctioning of the brain. These people didn’t know that their beliefs were false. In other cases, the\nmismatch resulted from an intentional lie or distortion, a process that is adaptive, designed to promote\nself-confidence and manipulate others. When I conjured up images of McEnroe, I momentarily deceived\nmyself. I believed it helped my game. I never thought I was McEnroe. I carried my self-deception\nhonestly. When Hilary Clinton misreported her trip to Bosnia, perhaps she misremembered or perhaps she\ndistorted her memory to convince voters that she had what was necessary to run the country ⎯⎯ toughness\nand international experience. Unfortunately for Clinton, her comment about Bosnia was accompanied by\nother distortions, which led the American essayist William Safire to write “Americans of all political\npersuasions are coming to the sad realization that our First Lady... is a congenital liar.”\nSome cases of self-deception are harmless and even beneficial, as in my illusion of tennis\ngrandeur. Others are only mildly harmful, as in Clinton’s distortion of her political experiences. And yet\nothers are deeply harmful, as when leaders such as Ahmadinejad deny the suffering of millions. The\nproblem is that anyone can harness the power of self-deception for ill gotten gains.\nWhy does our mind play tricks on us, allowing us to believe things that are false? Why didn’t\nevolution endow us with a reality checking device that is vigilant 24/7? The answer here parallels the\nrefrain carried throughout this book: like its evil sister dehumanization, self-deception is Janus-faced,\nshowing both an adaptive and maladaptive side. Self-deception allows us to protect ourselves from the\nreality of a current predicament or loss. Self-deception allows us to provide a better personal marketing\nbrand to defeat our competitors in attracting mates and garnering other resources. Self-deception may\neven be critical to the functioning of a healthy and safe society: in a study of male criminal offenders,\nthose with the lowest levels of self-deception with respect to their own self-worth showed the highest\nlevels of recidivism. There is, however, a fine balancing act, revealing the slippery slope from adaptive to\nmaladaptive: as studies by Roy Baumeister reveal, individuals with the highest self-esteem and the most\noverblown sense of themselves are also the ones most likely to lash out with extreme violence when\nsomeone threatens the reality of their stature.\nThe evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers was the first to identify the adaptive significance of\nself-deception and its connection to deception. As he insightfully notes in his book The Folly of Fools,\nwhat appears completely irrational about self-deception evolved as a consequence of selection to deceive\ncompetitors: “To fool others we might be tempted to reorganize information internally in all sorts of\nimprobable ways and to do so largely unconsciously.” The most effective self-deceiver acts without any\nsense of his true motives. He is on autopilot, driven by a purely self-interested mind. No checks and\nbalances. Here, I build on this idea. I will show you how studies of pathology and healthy brain function\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 107\nilluminate the mental chicaneries that lead us down the road to self-deception. As with the dangers of\ndehumanization and its role in denying reality, so too is self-deception a dangerous state of mind,\nallowing individuals to inflict great harm while feeling aligned with the angels.\nWhat did William Safire have in mind when he called Hilary Clinton a congenital liar?\nCongenital refers to a trait that is present in utero, at birth or soon thereafter. Congenital disorders,\ndiseases, or anomalies typically refer to defects caused by a combination of genetic and environmental\nproblems. A cleft lip is an example of a congenital anomaly, one that appears at birth as a gap in the\nupper lip. Because we don’t have detailed records of Hilary Clinton’s life as a child, it is hard to say\nwhether her lying was congenital in the same way that a hair lip is congenital. We can rule out the in\nutero and at birth periods because Hilary, like all other children, was not born speaking or lying. These\ncapacities mature. That she developed a tendency to exaggerate and distort is consistent with other\nreports. She falsely claimed that she was centrally involved in the creation of a Children’s Health\nInsurance Program, an initiative that was actually created by Senators Ted Kennedy and Orin Hatch. She\nalso claimed that she played a significant role in the Good Friday Agreement for Northern Ireland, a\ncomment that Nobel laureate Lord William David Trimble described as “a wee bit silly.” When Safire\ndescribed Clinton as a congenital liar, what he was referring to was the habitual pattern of fabrication.\nWhen patterns of the mind become habits, they are hard to break. Each distortion, rehearsed over and\nover, becomes part of the fabric of truth. It is a life story that starts as fiction and ends up as non-fiction in\nthe mind of the story-teller. We can begin to understand this transformation by looking at the clinician’s\nnotebook.\nFor more than 100 years, psychiatrists have described a syndrome known as pathological lying.\nIf lying is pathological, it must deviate from some norm. The psychiatrist Charles Dike sums up the\nessence of this disorder:\nPathological liars can believe their lies to the extent that, at least to\nothers, the belief may appear to be delusional; they generally have sound\njudgment in other matters; it is questionable whether pathological lying\nis always a conscious act and whether pathological liars always have\ncontrol over their lies; an external reason for lying (such as financial\ngain) often appears absent and the internal or psychological purpose for\nlying is often unclear; the lies in pathological lying are often unplanned\nand rather impulsive; the pathological liar may become a prisoner of his\nor her lies; the desired personality of the pathological liar may\noverwhelm the actual one; pathological lying may sometimes be\nassociated with criminal behavior; the pathological liar may\nacknowledge, at least in part, the falseness of the tales when\nenergetically challenged; and, in pathological lying, telling lies may\noften seem to be an end in itself.\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 108\nWhat seems most critical to the pathology is the lack of control which leads to repetitive lying over a long\nperiod of time. Compared with run of the mill liars, pathological liars often seem unaware that they are\nlying and do so many times a day as part of their daily habit. In the same way that birds have to fly and\nfish have to swim, pathological liars have to lie. If pathological liars are unaware of their lies and\nincapable of controlling themselves, then they are not responsible for the harm they impose. They have no\nchoice. Unbeknownst to them, their brain has been hijacked by a creative fiction writer. They are\nfollowing a script, but have no sense of its author.\nDike’s summary is based on a loose and eclectic set of clinical observations. Several clinicians\nthus debate whether habitual lying counts as pathology and thus, whether it is worthy of an entry into the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. For example, how can the clinician establish\npathology given the evidence that healthy people lie about twice a day, physicians lie about 40-80% of the\ntime to help their patients gain better health care, and lying within an experimental context increases as\nsubjects generate more lies? My own sense is that despite the difficulty of defining the pathology with\nprecision, clinicians have identified individuals that lie with every breath and often identify psychopaths\nby their calculated conning. These observations sharpen our approach to understanding the seeds of deceit\nand self-deception in the non-pathological condition. For example, does excessive and sustained lying\nstem from a specific problem associated with recognizing the truth or does it grow from a more general\nproblem with self-control? Or, does the habitual liar suffer from an emotional deficit such that when he or\nshe lies, there are no feelings of guilt and shame? Without these emotional regulators, it is impossible to\nlearn from the harm caused. When healthy people distort the truth, they often feel bad. When healthy\npeople think about distorting the truth, they often think about the potential harm and then silence the\noption to lie in favor of the truth. Perhaps unhealthy people never hear these emotional alarms. The mind\nsciences have begun addressing these issues.\nThe American neuroscientist Adrian Raine reported that individuals with a history of repeated\nlying and con-artistry have structurally different brains from non-liars, including individuals with a\nhistory of anti-social problems. Habitual liars have more white matter in the frontal lobes, but less grey\nmatter. White matter consists of axons and myelin. The axon is the part of a nerve cell that carries\ninformation. It is like the electric cable that runs from the power station. Myelin covers the axon, at least\nin healthy individuals. It is like the fat around your bones, protecting and insulating neurons. Fat helps\nkeep us warm. Myelin helps neurons transmit information. The grey matter consists of nerve cell bodies,\nwhich lack myelin. The function of grey matter is to connect up the neurons to transmit information\nbetween areas of the brain.\nRaine suggests that the increase in white matter gives habitual liars the upper hand when it comes\nto lying, helping them suppress the truth, control their emotions, and mind read what others believe and\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 109\ndesire. The decrease in gray matter allows habitual liars to lie without feeling guilty. The messaging\ncenter that sends healthy subjects moral reminders about the virtues of truth, is shut down or barely\naudible within the mind of a pathological liar. The brain of a pathological liar allows for the ultimate\npoker face. The brain of a healthy individual allows us to perfect the poker face by repeating a distorted\nnarrative, converting a lie into a self-justified truth. This is dangerous denial.\nWhen we lie, either to manipulate someone else or ourselves, we distort the truth. We can either\ndo this on the fly or use a narrative held in long-term memory. When Hilary Clinton told her supporters\nthat she had to dodge bullets in Bosnia, she either lied in the moment to convey a stronger image or she\ndeveloped this distortion over a long period of time. In the first instance, she knew that her comment\nabout Bosnia was false. She was deceptive, but not self-deceived. In the second case, she was selfdeceived\nand most likely unaware. Her narrative was so clear that she could picture running for cover\nwithout the usual welcoming party. Several studies now reveal that both forms of lying engage brain\nareas associated with self-control and conflict⎯⎯ the right backside of the prefrontal cortex and the\nanterior cingulate. This makes sense. To tell a lie, either to oneself or another, requires controlling what\nwe know about reality to convey an alternative reality. When we hold both versions of this narrative in\nmind, there is conflict. As we rehearse one version more than the other, the conflict dissipates. The more\nwe rehearse, the more we push this narrative into long term memory. The more we push this narrative\ninto long term memory, the more it becomes part of what we believe is true. The more we believe it is\ntrue, the more we hold onto a narrative that can be used to justify our actions.\nThe imaging results fit well with our understanding of which brain regions are involved in selfcontrol,\nconflict, memory, and social knowledge. To understand which regions are either necessary or\nsufficient for representing truths and lies, we turn to a technique called transcranial direct current\nstimulation. This method allows researchers to safely increase or decrease activity in a brain area\nthrough electrical stimulation. Think of this technique as a volume knob on an old fashioned radio. Turn it\nclockwise and you amplify the signal. Turn it counter-clockwise and you quiet the signal. When the\nGerman neuroscientist Ahmed Karim and his colleagues applied this technique to the right backside of\nthe prefrontal cortex, and decreased activity, healthy subjects were better at telling lies, lied without guilt,\nand were less stressed out as measured by the sweatiness of their skin. This pattern mirrors the natural\nstate of pathological liars. Absent the circuitry in the brain that exerts self-control over our distortions,\nKarim turned healthy subjects into conscience-free, poker-faced, liars.\nIf self-deception and deception are not only part of normal brain function, but adaptive processes,\nthen what makes this system turn toxic? What tips the brain over to the dark side, allowing self-deceptive\nillusions to empower the individuals and groups to cause great harm?\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 110\nI am God!\nAcross the globe, in Eastern and Western cultures, clinicians have reported a consistent pattern of\npsychotic delusion, typically associated with schizophrenia: many believe that they are God, God’s\nmessenger, or the Devil, equipped with extraordinary, invincible powers. This is the same disorder that\nled the Australian gentleman we encountered at the start of this chapter to believe that he had two heads\nand heard the voices of Jesus and Abraham. Estimates reveal a greater number of cases among Catholic\nthan Islamic or Protestant societies, and the fewest among Hindu societies, although experts are uncertain\nas to why such particular biases exist. The interesting point is that there are individual differences in the\nexpression of religious delusions that are at least partially mediated by the particular beliefs and customs\nof the religion. Religious delusions are also held with greater conviction than other delusions, more\nresistant to change, and often result in self-mutilation or harming others; when harm occurs, it follows\nthe narrative from a religious text, plucking out eyes or cutting off genitals as the means to cleansing\nsins.\nWhat makes religious delusions like these, in which the individual has created a narrative of\nsupreme confidence and power, different from non-delusional, non-psychotic forms of distortion? In a\nGallup poll, 10% of the Americans surveyed claimed they had spoken with the devil. In several\npsychological experiments, healthy non-psychotic subjects consistently report that they are smarter than\nmost, more attractive, and more likely to win than lose an athletic competition. Though some of these\npeople are correct ⎯⎯ they are in fact smarter, more attractive, and better competitors ⎯⎯ most are wrong\nand yet believe they are right. What this research reveals is that we all suffer, some more than others,\nfrom positive illusions ⎯⎯ biases that distort our sense of confidence, control, and invincibility These\nillusions differ from delusions in that they are less fixed, more flexible, and more amenable to change.\nDelusions are highly maladaptive, a signature of brain dysfunction, and the source of great suffering.\nPositive illusions, in contrast, are often highly adaptive, generating the confidence necessary to take on\ngreat challenges and challengers, convincing an audience or a group of opponents that we are stronger,\nsmarter, and sexier. Positive illusions have been linked to direct mental and physical health benefits,\nincluding evidence that distorted optimism can slow disease progression. Positive illusions are, as noted\nby the biologists Richard Wrangham, Robert Trivers, and Dominic Johnson, a form of self-deception with\nconsiderable evolutionary benefits. But like the runaway capacity of desire, so too can our illusions of\ngrandeur runaway. When this occurs, illusion and delusion are virtually indistinguishable. What was\nonce a narrative centered on the grandiose belief of being god-like has been transformed into the belief of\nbeing God, leading individuals and groups to engage in extreme extortion or violence, not only blind to\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 111\nobvious risks but incredulous that there would be any risks. This is denial. This is another way in which\nwe close off our senses to reality in order to create our own imagined reality. How does this process get\nstarted?\nIt is not until the age of about 18-24 months that we acquire the ability to recognize ourselves in a\nmirror. It is not until a couple of years later that we have a sense that our own beliefs can sometimes\ndiffer from others that we interact with. It is not until this time that we develop the capacity to deceive,\nalong with a powerful suite of social emotions that enable us to feel embarrassed, envious, and elated.\nThese feelings link up our sense of self with our sense of others. These are comparative feelings and\nbeliefs, and they feed back to who we are, either building up our self-confidence or crushing it. When my\ndaughter Sofia was ten years old, she announced that she will one day go to Brown University ⎯⎯\nattracted by their course offerings and the fact that Emma Watson, aka Hermione Granger of Harry Potter\nfame, was a student ⎯⎯ be rich and have five children ⎯⎯ she wanted more siblings and has always had a\ntaste for the luxurious ⎯⎯ obtain a veterinarian degree ⎯⎯ my wife is a veterinarian and we have five pets\n⎯⎯ open a restaurant ⎯⎯ I love to cook ⎯⎯ and be an Olympian in gymnastics ⎯⎯ sports run in our family.\nSofia was not delusional, but brimming with uncalibrated confidence. Her confidence was uncalibrated\nbecause she had no sense of what it takes to get into Brown, become rich, take care of five kids, obtain a\nvet degree, open a restaurant, and win gold. My wife and I would be horrid parents if we burst her\nbubble. We would be irresponsible parents if we didn’t, over time, describe the exciting challenges\nassociated with each of these desirable goals.\nDeveloping a sense of self depends on at least two capacities: looking inwards at what we know\nand are capable of doing, and looking outwards at what others know and are capable of doing. When we\nlook inwards, if we honestly open our eyes to the richness of our autobiography, we will recognize cases\nwhere we have succeeded and those in which we have failed. This history reveals our knowledge and\nignorance, our strengths and weaknesses, and our capacity to exert control or meld to external forces.\nWhen we look outwards, again with an honest, panoramic perspective, we learn about those who know\nmore or less than we do, about those we can outcompete and those we lose to in defeat, and about\nsituations that undermine our capacity for self-control. Distortion enters these personal narratives when\nwe either lack information or filter it in some way, consciously or unconsciously.\nThe British criminology scholar Mandeep Dhami examined positive illusions in criminals\nincarcerated in prisons within the United States and the United Kingdom. Because recidivism levels are\nhigh among convicted criminals, with 40-60% of offenders re-convicted after 1-3 years from release, it is\nimportant to understand risk factors. One possibility is that criminals believe that their prior offense was\njust a one-off event or bad luck, and that, of course, they will never engage in crime again, having learned\ntheir lesson and feeling fully confident in their capacity to lead a crime-free life. Based on a sample of\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 112\nover 500 prisoners from medium security prisons, 60-80% believed that they would find a place to live as\nwell as employment once released, whereas less than 30% felt that they would commit another crime.\nPrisoners also felt that they were much less likely to commit another crime than other prisoners. Thus,\nwhether prisoners were evaluating their own chances of success or their success relative to others, they\nwere living with a distorted narrative. The shorter the criminal record, the more distorted the narrative.\nRepeated experience with crime appears to anchor the narrative in a more realistic assessment of the\nfuture.\nCertain experiences can also enhance positive illusions by giving individuals an unrealistic sense\nof self-control, along with a distorted expectation that future outcomes are highly deterministic. For\nexample, people who are wealthy, highly educated, part of a dominant group, or citizens within a society\nthat values independence, are more likely to believe that they have control over the future and are more\nlikely to express optimism and high self-esteem. These attitudes often lead to a boosted sense of control\nand an illusory sense of control over future outcomes. The American psychologist Nathanael Fast ran a\nseries of experiments to further explore the relationship between power and illusory control, specifically\nasking whether subjects endowed with power expect control over outcomes that are strictly due to chance\nor that are unrelated to the domain of power. Across each study, whether subjects recalled a personal\nsituation where they were in power or had to imagine being in power, they were more likely than those in\na subordinate position to express confidence about the outcome of rolling a six-sided die, predicting the\nfuture of a company, and influencing the results of a national election. Power and winning distort, a tale\nthat has been told and retold countless times in the annals of industry and warfare. As the American\nbusiness administration scholars Francesca Gino and Gary Pisano note, the business world is full of cases\nwhere leaders and leading companies crash because they fail to examine the causes of success. They\nassume, for example, that their success is entirely due to their brilliance, control over the market, and the\nweakness of the competition, as opposed to a shot of good luck. So too goes the story of unexamined war\nvictories, as supremely confident generals discount relevant information about their opponents, leading\nbattalions on a death march. Our willingness to accept victories without question stands in direct contrast\nwith our motivation to scrutinize failures, drilling down for explanations or causes. When we lose or fail\nin some way, the negative emotions accompanying this experience focus our attention on working out an\nexplanation. When we win, we bask in the glory, fueled by the brain’s chemicals and the body’s\nhormones. This physiological orchestration sets up the positive illusion of overconfidence, a winning\ncard in many competitive arenas, and a disaster in others.\nRecall from chapter 1 that our brains, and the brains of other animals, are configured to reward\nvictory with a cascade of hormonal and neurobiological changes. Winning delivers a shot of testosterone,\nand so too does observing others win. Winning also delivers a shot of dopamine, further generating a\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 113\nhoney hit to the brain when we shine. There is evidence that schizophrenia is associated with a\ndysfunctional dopamine system, which might help explain the overconfidence in their beliefs, especially\nbeliefs in powerful religious icons. Winning boosts confidence, which increases the chances of winning\nagain. This is a highly adaptive cycle that can lead to overconfidence.\nDominic Johnson took advantage of the research on human and animal competition to explore the\nlink between overconfidence, testosterone, and war within the context of a simulated game. Each subject\nplayed the role of a leader in a country at war with another over diamond resources. The goal of the game\nwas to accrue the highest level of resources or defeat the neighboring country. Though war games on a\ncomputer can not capture the full reality of war, the fact is that military specialists throughout the world\nuse simulations to prepare combatants for some of the strategic and emotional problems they will\nconfront.\nMost subjects judged that they would outcompete their opponents, and this was exacerbated in\nmales relative to females. Those who believed that they would whip their opponents actually had the\nworst records, suggesting that they were not only uncalibrated but that their distortion of reality led to\ncostly outcomes. Those with the highest expectation of victory had the highest testosterone levels and\nwere most likely to launch unprovoked attacks on their opponents.\nWhether in real life or in the simulated world of computer games, brimming overconfidence can\nlead to a distorted sense of risk and the odds of victory in war ⎯⎯ or any competitive arena. Though this is\na costly strategy, there are clear evolutionary benefits under conditions explained by Trivers and Johnson.\nSelf-deception is favored when opponents have imperfect information about their strengths and\nweaknesses, and where the payoffs are high relative to the costs. Self-deception leads individuals to go\nfor it, convincing themselves and others that the risks are low, the gains are great, and the standard social\nnorms are no longer applicable. This is a dangerous form of denial, recruiting moral disengagement to\njustify horrific means and ends. This is a piece of the psychology that can facilitate the process of\nrunaway desire. This is a piece of the psychology that enables individuals to cause great harms.\nMy goal in this book has been to find the universal core of evil, the elements or ingredients that\nare shared across all cases of evil. My suggestion is that the mixture of desire and denial are both\nnecessary and sufficient ingredients in the recipe for evil. All other ingredients are flourishes, creative\nadditions that do not take away from the universal core. Within each of us is a recipe for causing\nexcessive harm and for expressing exceptional compassion. We have choices. But as evidence\naccumulates from the sciences, it has become increasingly clear that some of us have fewer choices than\nothers. Some of us are equipped to resist the temptations of a culture of evil, while others fall prey. This is\nthe story of our species. This is our story.\nHauser Chapter 3.

Ravages of denial 118\nChapter 4:\nWicked in waiting\nThe wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they\nbe born, speaking lies.\n⎯⎯ Bible, Psalm 53:8\nGrowing up is a lottery. No one has a say over their genes or their parents, including the environment that\nis created on their behalf. For individuals raised in poverty, abused by parents or abandoned by them,\nthere may come a time when it is possible to purge the past, rise above it, and lay down new tracks.\nSuccess in this endeavor depends upon biological potential and the environment’s toxicity. Though every\nhealthy human being acquires the same basic biological ingredients, individual differences in how our\nbiology expresses itself can either provide immunity against toxic environments or deep vulnerabilities.\nThe unlucky ones inherit genes that predispose to sensation-seeking and risk-taking, callous and\nunemotional attitudes toward others, weak self-control, and narcissistic leanings. With this lottery ticket,\nit takes little to trigger the mindset of an evildoer. And yet some resist. An impressive accumulation of\nscientific evidence helps explain the source of these individual differences, including its role in sculpting\ndifferent personality profiles that either deviate greatly from societal norms or follow them to perfection.\nWhat’s normal?\nMuch of our fascination with evil stems from the distinct impression that evildoers are anomalies. Their\nactions are inhuman, unimaginable, rarely witnessed, and detrimental to our species’ survival. This\nimpression carries with it an assumption about what is expected or typical of our species, as well as what\nis possible. It assumes that evildoers have thoughts, feelings, and desires that fall outside of the repertoire\nof an average human being. Their actions are unimaginable because most human minds lack the capacity\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 119\nto imagine butchering human bodies. Like so many simple claims that go unchallenged, we should be\npuzzled by this one. We should ask: what’s normal?\nThe evolutionary history of each species’ brain does not provide a complete account of what the\nbrain can do. Consider again a topic from chapter 1: domesticated dogs and their ancestors, the wolves.\nThough dogs live with humans, and are often raised by them, they never acquire a human language. In\nthis sense, the domesticated dog is just like the wolf. But what dogs can do, with greater facility than any\nwild wolf, is understand a variety of human gestures such as pointing and the movement of our eyes. This\ncapacity emerged following a period of human domestication. Wolves were not part of this selective\nregime. But, and this is the most interesting twist in the story, wolf puppies raised by human caretakers\ndevelop into adults that can read pointing and looking extremely well. This tells us that even wolves\nevolved the potential to read human gestures, but only human environments favor this skill. This tells us\nthat what animals express is not necessarily indicative of their potential. To uncover their potential, we\nmust alter the environment or wait for such changes to happen naturally.\nWhen we ask What’s normal?, we are asking two questions: what is the evolved repertoire and\nwhat is the evolved capacity? The evolved repertoire tells us something about the relationship between a\nspecies’ biology and the environments that have shaped their behavior. The evolved capacity tells us\nabout a reservoir of behaviors that may only emerge in novel environments.\nWhat’s normal human behavior? The same distinctions apply to us as to dogs and wolves, with\nthe extra complication that our species adds because of historical twists and turns orchestrated by legal,\npolitical, ethical, religious, and medical points of view. History presents us with hundreds of cases where\nan accepted normal mutated into abnormal, or where abnormal transformed into normal. During the\nItalian Baroque ⎯⎯ a period of decadence that started in the late 16th century and ended in the early 18th\ncentury ⎯⎯ some 500,000 boys were castrated in order to freeze their youthful voices for the enjoyment\nof others. These castrati formed an essential part of music culture, of what people expected and wanted.\nFor many of these young boys, not only did castration end their reproductive careers, but often, their\nlives.\nAs the 18th century drew to a close, so too did castration in the name of art. What was normal\nthen is perceived as abnormal and heinous today. The same story can be told for other sexual practices,\nincluding female genital mutilation, circumcision, and homosexuality. In the United States,\nhomosexuality was considered a disease before the 1970s, with its own entry in the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Thanks to an underground movement of gay psychiatrists and\nthe work of Evelyn Hooker who discovered that the manual’s classification entry was based entirely on\nclinical interviews of gay prisoners, homosexuality has been freed from its jail sentence as a mental\ndisease ⎯⎯ as abnormal.\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 120\nWhen clinicians diagnose individuals with a mental disorder, they are making a statement about\ndeviance, about what falls within and outside the range of normal mental states. Unfortunately, there are\nno clear categories, no bright lines separating normal from abnormal or uncommon. As the distinguished\nAmerican psychologist William James noted, however, studying “the abnormal is the best way to\nunderstand the normal.” Let’s follow this logic.\nConsider the developmental disorder of autism. This disorder, typified by difficulties\nunderstanding what others believe and feel, ranges from individuals who appear locked out of the world,\nrocking back and forth to their own internal rhythm, to high functioning individuals such as Professor\nTemple Grandin, who not only teaches college-level courses, but has done wonders as a spokesperson for\nautism and for the animal welfare movement. This range already tells us that autism is represented by a\nspectrum, once identified by purely behavioral measures, but joined today by genetic and neurobiological\nmarkers. The genetic evidence is particularly helpful for explaining the observed variation. For example,\nthe MAOA gene, located on the X chromosome, is involved in the regulation of social behavior and has\ndifferent forms that map to differences in brain activity and stress physiology. The different forms\ncorrespond to the number of copies of the genetic material. This copy number is, in turn, partially\nresponsible for the spectrum of autism observed, especially the degree of social dysfunction, including\nstress and aggression. Once we admit to a spectrum, and begin to pinpoint the factors that push\nindividuals to stand on one end or the other, we must admit to admitting virtually everyone onto this\nspectrum. All of us, at some point in our life, have lacked sensitivity to the feelings and beliefs of others.\nAll of us have been self-absorbed and locked out from the rest of the world. All of us have failed to\nexpress empathy and compassion to others. All of us have been a bit abnormal in this sense. All of us\nfall, on occasion, within the spectrum of autism as well as other disorders of the mind such as\npsychopathy.\nLike autism, psychopathy is not one neat and tidy disorder, but a spectrum. Diagnostically,\npsychopaths are impulsive, narcissistic, and lacking in social emotions such as empathy, remorse, and\nguilt. These behaviorally defined characteristics are complimented by genetic and neurobiological\nmarkers, some pointing to risks in the pre-school years, and linked to the same MAOA gene noted above.\nThe spectrum that defines psychopaths ranges from hyper-smart, calculating, and powerful politicians to\nlow IQ, downtrodden, serial murderers. Everyone of us occasionally shows our psychopathic face: selfabsorbed,\nimpatient, manipulative, and uncaring. What is abnormal, then, is living with these\ncharacteristics, all the time. Clinically diagnosed psychopaths, like clinically diagnosed individuals with\nautism, have the characteristic traits as stable components of their personality. An honest clinician will\ntell you, however, that stability is difficult to define, and so too are the essential traits. An honest brain\nscientist will also tell you that, despite the observation that psychopaths have hyperactive dopamine brain\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 121\ncircuits that may drive sensation seeking, along with smaller frontal lobe circuits that may minimize their\nsensitivity to punishment and the capacity for self-control, these differences are statistical. What\n“statistical” means is that if you were to stack up all of the brains with hyperactive dopamine circuits and\nsmaller frontal lobes into one pile, most, but not all would be from psychopaths. You would also find\npsychopaths in the pile of brains showing normal dopamine activity and average-sized frontal lobes.\nThese brain differences are interesting, but they are not yet like fingerprints, absolutely and uniquely\ndistinctive and diagnostic of a disorder. Such honesty reveals the challenges we face in answering the\nsimple question What’s normal?\nLawyers, judges and juries face the same problem as clinicians, often relying upon documents\nsuch as the DSM to determine when someone has acted outside the range of normal behavior. But for\nlegal cases, there are two relevant layers of the normalcy problem. The first concerns whether the\nsupposed criminal was sane or insane. An insanity defense requires evidence of a disease or defect of the\nmind. It requires evidence that the individual lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminal nature of the\nact as well as the capacity to conform. This is the part that relies on the DSM, as well as clinicians who\ncan testify based on their expertise. The second concerns a more general understanding of what a\nprototypical or normal human would or could do in a given situation. The idea seems straightforward\nenough, but as I mentioned above, is only deceptively straightforward.\nCrimes of passion provide a useful illustration of the challenges we face, especially with respect\nto understanding how harm is ignited in the face of moral norms against it. Highlighting the truism that\nlove makes you crazy, the crime of passion defense is invoked for cases where, in the heat of the moment,\nan individual finds and kills his or her spouse in bed with a lover. The defining feature of a crime of\npassion is that it was not planned and most people faced with the same situation would act similarly,\nunable to control their emotions.\nThe crime of passion defense seems straightforward. Like autism and psychopathy, however, it\ntoo relies upon a diagnosis of what a prototypical or average person would do in the same situation. This\ndiagnosis requires an understanding of two difficult mental states: planning and self-control. Planning\ninvolves imagining the future, time traveling to a new world, dreaming up what we might do and how we\nmight feel. We plan in the short and long term, filling up our mental sticky notes with to-do lists. Selfcontrol\nenters into planning because what we imagine for ourselves ⎯⎯ what we desire ⎯⎯ is often\ninappropriate or unethical because it harms others or ourselves. As noted in chapters 2 and 3, the capacity\nto keep desire in check relies on moral engagement. Moral engagement requires self-control. Moral\ndisengagement requires denial in order to loosen the grip of self-control and enable desire to have its\nway.\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 122\nWhen Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband John Bobbitt’s penis, she fulfilled her desire to harm\nanother. She carried out this gruesome act despite the moral and legal sanctions against it. But she did\nnot plan this act in advance, and nor did it occur in the heat of the moment, triggered by finding her\nhusband in bed with a lover. It followed in the wake of his repeated philandering, attempted rape and\npsychological abuse. As an act, it fell between the cracks of a long-term plan and a reflexive response ⎯⎯\nit was hatched on the night of the fatal attack, triggered by seeing a carving knife in the kitchen. Lorena\neither lost self-control for that fatal moment or she was in complete control, aware of what she was about\nto do and justified by her own moral convictions, believing that harming John was just deserts. John was\nmost definitely not innocent. The jury delivered a “not guilty” decision, appealing to a crime of passion\ndefense. This decision effectively excused Lorena’s harmful act as normal and justified given the\nmitigating circumstances.\nWhen we consider the nature of evil, we must pause to consider our own biases and prejudices\nabout what’s normal. We must ask about the human potential, about our evolved capacities and our\nability to behave in novel ways in novel environments. When we say that a person, group or nation is evil,\nwe are saying something important about human nature, about our capability as a species. We are saying\nsomething important about the relationship between nature and nurture.\nEvil eggs and corrosive coops\nHow much do career criminals cost? Estimates from the United States suggest that if you can prevent a\nhigh risk child from entering this career, you save $1.5-2 million in costs of education, mental health, and\ncriminal fees. Educational facilities such as the Penikese Island School in Massachusetts, where I have\nhad the privilege of working, spend about $100,000 per student per year to keep high-risk teens off the\nstreets and out of jail. Based on statistics collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, approximately\n100,000 individuals under the age of 18 years were arrested in 2007 for violent crimes ⎯⎯ murder, forcible\nrape, and aggravated assault. If we had nurtured and educated these teenagers before they committed\nsuch crimes, we would have saved close to $100,000,000,000. Violent crime prevention pays. How does a\ncareer of violent crime start? Are there early warning signs? How early? How much starts with the egg\nand how much with the coop in which it was raised?\nEarly scientific interests in this chicken and egg problem can be traced to the efforts of the Italian\nphysician and psychologist Cesare Lombroso. In 1876, he published his magnum opus The Criminal\nMan. This was a serious, scholarly book aimed at understanding “whether there is a force in nature that\ncauses crime.” Based on measurements of both anatomical and psychological characteristics, Lombroso\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 123\nconcluded that criminals were born not made. Their defining features were throwbacks to our\nevolutionary ancestors, dehumanized by biological defects. Modern man was civilized and elegant.\nCriminal man was barbaric, a savage with slanted forehead, jutting jaw, and excessively long arms.\nCriminal man was more ape-like than human-like. Because the cause of these differences was biological,\nLombroso argued that a life of crime was inevitable. Change through rehabilitation was hopeless. To\nprotect society, these natural born criminals had to be taken out of society, either locked up or executed.\nThese ideas formed the basis of several eugenics’ movements, with the aim of weeding out the\nundesirable, less than human elements of society, be they less intelligent, from a non-Caucasian racial\ngroup, or from a culture with different religious beliefs.\nLombroso’s theory of criminality was soon rejected as scholars from a variety of different\ndisciplines unearthed its racial stereotypes and shoddy methods, including a failure to include the many\npeople with slanted foreheads, jutting jaws, and long arms who never committed crimes, and those with\nstatuesque anatomy who did. This initiated a general skepticism and even fear of biological explanations,\ncausing a swing in the opposite direction. Criminals were not born but made by corrupt societies.\nHumans are not born with biologically encoded scripts for behaving with malice or virtue. Rather, we are\nborn with blank slates, waiting for society to inscribe its distinctive signature. So began a pendulous\nswing from nature to nurture. Though the oscillation continues to this day, there is increasing\nappreciation, perhaps especially in the arena of criminology, that both nature and nurture make important\ncontributions. This change comes, in part, from a far greater understanding of genetics, combined with\nlong term studies of how humans and other animals develop within environments that are either nurturing\nor damaging.\nConsider the MAOA gene that I mentioned in the last section. This gene produces an enzyme that\ngoes by the same shorthand of MAOA, or MonoAmine Oxidase A. MAOA is evolutionarily ancient,\nshared with other animals, and has two different forms ⎯⎯ low and high ⎯⎯ that influence the level of\nserotonin as well as the brain areas involved in social evaluation and emotional regulation. Early\nevidence for the critical role of this gene in social behavior emerged from a study that knocked it out of\noperation. If you knock out the MAOA gene in mice, they quickly become hyper-hyper-aggressive.\nThese genetically transformed mice have no capacity to regulate their social behavior. Consequently, all\ninteractions are treated as confrontational and handled by aggressive attacks. These results are consistent\nwith a large body of work in animals showing that heightened aggression and low levels of serotonin go\nhand in hand. These results are also consistent with work on humans. In, 1993, the Dutch biologist Hans\nBrunner analyzed the genetics of a large, extended family. Some individuals within this family were born\nwith a defect that silenced the operation of the MAOA gene; they were like the mice who had this gene\nsilenced. Relative to others in the family, these individuals had a pronounced history of violence,\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 124\nincluding murder, rape, and arson. Oddly, although this work provided one of the cleanest links between\ngenes and violence in humans, it slid under the radar of scientific attention, only to be resuscitated and\nenriched about ten years later.\nThe behavioral geneticists Avshalom Caspi and Terry Moffitt studied a large population of young\nboys over several years. Though boys and girls have the MAOA gene, its effect on behavior is easier to\nstudy in boys because they have only one copy whereas girls have two, one for each of their two X\nchromosomes. For each boy, Caspi and Moffitt collected information on the presence and frequency of\ntheir antisocial behavior and whether they were raised by parents who were caring, mildly abusive, or\nseverely abusive. For each boy, they also noted whether they had the low or high expressing form of\nMAOA.\nCaspi and Moffitt’s results provided a textbook example of nature’s interaction with nurture. If\nthe parents were caring, the genes made no difference in their child’s personality or behavior. If the\nparents were mildly abusive, the boys with the low activity form were nine times more likely to fight,\nsteal, bully, and defiantly break rules. For those boys with severely abusive parents and the low activity\nform of MAOA, 85% developed into violent, delinquent criminals. What these findings tell us is that in\nhumans, it makes little difference which form of MAOA you have if you grow up with nurturing parents.\nBut if you grow up with abusive parents, your genes make all the difference in the world. Those with the\nlow expressing form are more likely than not to develop into delinquents, whereas those with the high\nexpressing form are more likely than not to develop immunity. By a double dose of bad luck, one shot\nfrom the genes and one from the environment, some have a high probability of entering into the pool of\npotential evildoers.\nThe German neuroscientist Andreas Meyer-Lindenburg took the genetic work one step further,\nlinking the particular form of MAOA up to differences in the brain. Those with relatively poor social\nregulation and the low expressing form of MAOA had significantly smaller brains, specifically in regions\nassociated with the control of emotion and social behavior ⎯⎯ the amygdala, anterior cingulate, and\nprefrontal cortex. These individuals also had less connectivity between these regions, harking back to the\nimportance of promiscuity both between humans and other animals, but also within our own species. Less\nconnectivity translates to less control by the frontal areas of the brain over emotion-relevant areas such as\nthe amygdala. When individuals with the low expressing form viewed angry or fearful facial expressions,\nthe emotionally-relevant brain areas went into hyper-drive, whereas those areas involved in regulating\nemotions hibernated. Thus, in contrast with individuals who have the high expressing form of MAOA,\nthose with the low expressing form are overwhelmed by emotionally charged experiences, lacking the\nmental brakes to stay cool. By luck of the draw, the low expressing form of MAOA builds a child that is\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 125\nmore likely to get angry and violent in the face of frustration and other emotional challenges, whereas the\nhigh expressing form builds a child that is walled off, immune to the same challenges.\nMAOA is crucial not only in long term human development, but also in everyday, ephemeral\nsocial interactions. In a laboratory study, an experimenter offered subjects the opportunity to earn up to\n$10 on a vocabulary quiz. Once they finished the quiz, they learned that an anonymous person in another\nroom either took some of their earnings or left it alone. With this information in hand, the quiz-taker\ncould either vindictively punish the person by giving them some hot sauce or they could cash out of the\ngame and recover the money lost. In other words, they could either vindictively burn their opponent or\nrecover their losses at no cost. In reality, there was no partner in the other room. When subjects with the\nlow expressing form of MAOA lost most of their earnings, they were far more likely to deliver the hot\nsauce than those with the high expressing form; they were also most likely to deliver the highest amount\nof the sauce. Like long-term parental abuse, even short-term provocation invoked in a laboratory\nenvironment can cause those with the low expressing form of MAOA to act out and attack.\nAs with all genes that have different forms, the number of individuals with the low expressing\nform of MAOA varies by population, including different ethnic and culturally identified groups.\nCaucasian and Hispanic males show some of the lowest frequencies at 34 and 29 % respectively, whereas\nMaori, Pacific Islander, and Chinese males show the highest at 56, 61, and 77% respectively. In a study of\nover 1000 men, individuals with the low expressing form of MAOA were more likely to be in violent\ngangs, and once in gangs, were more likely to use guns and knives than individuals with the high\nexpressing form. Variation in the frequency of these two forms is interesting as it provides the signature\nhandiwork of natural selection. When the frequency of one form goes up, the most likely explanation is\nthat this form benefits the individual carriers. When the frequency goes down, there is a hidden cost. In\nlight of this teeter-tottering of frequencies, the Maori are of interest. As celebrated by many New\nZealanders today, the Maori were a highly adventurous and warring people. Individuals who took risks\nand fiercely defended their resources were heroes. Heroes may have been carriers of the low expressing\nform of MAOA. Heroes often leave more offspring, who were also carriers of the low expressing form.\nIn the Maori environment, selection may well have favored this form of the gene. The important point is\nthat different environments will favor different frequencies of the two forms of MAOA. This helps\nexplain both the cause of individual differences and the challenges we face in confronting cultures of\nviolence that are fueled by nature and nurture.\nMany other labs have followed up on Caspi and Moffitt’s long term, developmental study. Most\nfind the same relationship between the MAOA gene and antisocial behavior. Others add to this account\nby showing how different genes and early appearing physiological differences contribute to a highly\naggressive and antisocial starting state. In one study, the German psychologist Alexander Strobel put\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 126\nsubjects in a brain scanner and invited them to play a bargaining game where they could punish someone\nwho acted unfairly to them ⎯⎯ personal revenge ⎯⎯ or punish someone who acted unfairly to someone\nelse ⎯⎯ impersonal punishment. For each subject, Strobel also collected information on a gene called\nCOMT Met. This gene has three different forms, linked to differences in activity level in the frontal lobe\nof the brain, which are linked to differences in the levels of dopamine, which are linked to differences in\nthe experience of reward. Given the different forms of COMT Met, at least part of what we experience as\nthe feeling of reward or gratification was determined by our parents, and our parent’s parents, and their\nparent’s parents, all the way back to our ape-like cousins who evolved this gene.\nWhen Strobel looked at the brain scans of his subjects, he found that the same circuitry was\nengaged for personal revenge and impersonal punishment, with significant activity in the striatum ⎯⎯ a\nreward area ⎯⎯ as well as in the insula ⎯⎯ an area involved in the feeling of disgust. When we detect an\ninjustice, we feel disgusted, a feeling that may motivate our desire for retribution. The striatum finishes\noff the process, rewarding us for our punitive response, and wiping out the negative feeling of disgust.\nImportantly, individuals with the high expressing form of COMT Met, and thus, higher levels of\ndopamine, showed stronger activation in the striatum, and were more likely to punish those who act\nunfairly. Strobel suggests that those with the high expressing form punished more because they\nanticipated a higher level of reward. If this explanation is right, it has profound consequences for how we\nthink about individual participation in the policing of norms and the honey hits associated with\naggression. Some people will have a natural bias to shy away from punishment, not because they fail to\nsee the importance of ratting out cheaters, but because they don’t anticipate feeling good about it. Others\nwill be prone to punish even the most minor infractions because they feel empowered and good about it.\nThose who are empowered to punish because it feels good have forged a stronger association between\naggression and reward. Unbeknownst to these individuals, they started life with a bias, one that colored\ntheir willingness to harm others. This bias is joined by many others that I discuss in the next few sections.\nThe take home message is that if you are born male, endowed with certain genetic variants such\nas the low activity form of MAOA, and experience physical and psychological abuse by your parents, the\nodds of delinquency are frighteningly high. That’s the bad news. The good news is that if you are born\nmale, have the high activity variant of the MAOA gene, and experience physical and psychological abuse\nby your parents, you are vaccinated by nature against the harms of your unfortunate nurture. The\nproblem, of course, is that you have no say over which endowment you get, nor over the kinds of parents\nyou receive.\nOne of the reasons I have worked through this case study of genetic constraints and\nenvironmental sculpting is to provide an antidote to the often polarized views that have dominated much\nof the historical and psychological literature on evil. Many of the earliest, and most famous psychological\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 127\nexperiments were related in one way or another to Hannah Arendt’s thoughts about Adolf Eichmann and\nthe fact that good people are capable of horrific things: the banality of evil. Hiding behind every average\nJoe is a person equipped with an engine of malice. Banality is the veil of evil. Thus, the American\npsychologist Stanley Milgram showed that normal people were capable of shocking innocent others when\nan authority figure told them to do so; of course, there were no shocks, but the subjects believed they\nwere real. Similarly, the American psychologists Solomon Asch and Philip Zimbardo showed that\nnormal people followed group attitudes and instructions, bleating like mindless sheep, no reflection, no\ncritical thinking, no concern about the consequences of their actions. In Zimbardo’s study ⎯⎯ the famous\nStanford prison experiments ⎯⎯ run of the mill undergraduates playing the role of prison guards turned\ninto little dictators, mentally and physically abusing their run of the mill undergraduates playing the role\nof prisoners. Together, these studies seemed to support a blank slate view of the mind, a tablet waiting for\ninscription by the local culture, with no constraints on the written matter.\nA closer look at many of these studies reveals far more variation in how individuals responded,\nsuggesting that differences in their genetic make-up and personal experience either facilitated their\nwillingness to follow authority and ideology or prevented it. Many subjects in both the Milgram and\nZimbardo studies refused to follow the orders or rules of the game. Those who refused tended to identify\nmore with the victim and less with the authority figure or ideology. This suggests important differences in\nthe capacity to experience empathy and compassion for another. Studies by the cognitive neuroscientist\nEsse Viding show that by the pre-school years, some children have a diminished capacity for empathy,\nexpressing a deeply callous and unemotional character. These children exhibit severe conduct problems,\nespecially violence. These children lack remorse and an awareness of others’ distress. They are cold,\nheartless kids. If they have a twin, they are more likely to share this callous-unemotional personality than\ntwo unrelated children, revealing the trademark of a powerful genetic engine. More boys than girls fall on\nthe high end of this callous-unemotional scale ⎯⎯ where high translates to colder and more callous. Those\nwho score highest on the scale engage in more direct physical bullying than those who score lower. High\nscorers lack the skills to modulate their behavior following direct or anticipated punishment. These\nindividuals also show reduced activity in the amygdala, a part of the brain that is critically involved in\nregulating emotion, especially the assignment of a positive or negative value on our actions and\nexperiences. These individual differences persist into adulthood. These are the kind of individual\ndifferences that can explain why some followed Milgram and Zimbardo’s instructions to perfection, while\nothers resisted, exerting self-control.\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 128\nThe sweetness of control\nWhen humans and other animals travel the road to excess, whether for food consumption, violence,\npower, or sex, it is either because they gave in to an in-the-moment impulsive itch or because a history of\nlosing self-control turned into an addictive habit. What causes us to lose our sense of moderation, allow\nour mental brakes to slip, and give in to temptation? What causes our preferences to inconsistently and\nirrationally shift over time, allowing seductive offerings to win? If you are the eminent social\npsychologist Roy Baumeister who has contributed fundamental insights into the nature of evil, the answer\nis simple: sugar. Love it. Want it. Need it.\nWhen we work hard, focusing on a difficult problem or trying to figure out the best decision,\nexhaustion strikes. Part of our exhaustion comes from the fact that we have depleted a critical resource:\nsugar, or more precisely, glucose. When the availability of this resource diminishes, we also lose selfcontrol.\nThis is why the loss of self-control has a cycle that follows the time of day, with the greatest\nlosses occurring late rather than early: diet breakers are more likely to pig out in the evening than early in\nthe morning; shoppers are more likely to buy impulsively as the day moves on; impulsive crimes and\nrelapses of addiction are evening affairs; judges are more likely to dole out punishment at the end of a day\nin court than when they start a new day. Dozens of experiments show that if you have to exert selfcontrol\nin one context it taxes your capacity to exert self-control in another. For example, if you ask\nsubjects to avoid laughing while watching a comedy routine, avoid thinking about a white bear, or avoid\neating chocolates now to have radishes later, these same subjects will squeeze a hand grip for a shorter\nperiod of time than subjects who never contended with the various self-control tasks. When you deplete\nyour personal resources, you lose your grip, opening yourself up to binge eating, unnecessary violence,\nsexual promiscuity, and drug relapses.\nHow do we know that glucose is responsible? If you give people a milkshake with real sugar\nbefore they have to take a hard test involving self-control, they do better than if you give them a\nmilkshake with an artificial sweetener. If you first make people take a test that taxes their attention, and\ncauses their glucose to drop, they do worse on a subsequent test, including the hand grip squeezing test. In\nan extraordinary series of experiments and observations, the American psychologist Nathan DeWall\nfound that subjects who drank lemonade with glucose were less likely to respond aggressively to an insult\nthan subjects who drank lemonade with artificial sweetener; individuals with diabetes ⎯⎯ who have\ndifficulty regulating blood glucose, and thus have less of it ⎯⎯ reported higher levels of aggression on a\nquestionnaire than non-diabetics; within the United States, those states with higher numbers of diabetics\nshowed higher crime rates; and countries with a higher frequency of a genetic disorder that lowers\nglucose levels showed higher killing rates both in and out of war.\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 129\nTo accept DeWall's striking results, it is necessary to accept one connection between self-control\nand aggression and a second between glucose and self-control:\nSELF-CONTROL DOWN � AGGRESSION UP\nGLUCOSE DOWN � SELF-CONTROL DOWN\nThat aggression often follows from a loss of control is backed up by considerable evidence, including\nclinical studies that link lack of inhibition in psychopaths to extreme violence. Also of interest is the fact\nthat impulsive aggression is more likely to arise when individuals are drunk than sober. Alcohol, as we all\nknow, lowers our inhibitions, but also lowers glucose in both the brain and body. Though scientists such\nas Baumeister and DeWall have not yet worked out in detail how glucose is used or replenished in the\ncontext of self-control, there are far too many studies using different methods and subjects to ignore this\nrelationship. Minimally, these studies indicate that we should think about self-control like a resource,\nsomething that can be used up and replenished, something that can be depleted, tipping the scale toward\nviolence.\nOne of the interesting implications of DeWall’s work is that individual differences in glucose\navailability are coupled with individual differences in self-control. Diabetes shows a high level of\nheritability, meaning that some individuals are more likely to develop this problem than others simply\nbased on what genes they receive from their parents. The prevalence of diabetes is on the rise in many\ncountries, with some estimates suggesting that by 2025, there will be 325,000,000 diabetics world wide,\nmore than double current estimates. The genetic disorder that lowers glucose levels arises because of a\ndeficiency in a key enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase. This is one of the most common\nenzyme deficiencies in the world, affecting over 400,000,000 people, and in many cases, triggered by the\nconsumption of fava beans. As with variation in the frequency of MAOA, so too can variation in this\nglucose-related gene be subject to selection pressures, especially given its link to violence. Once again,\nwe see nature and nurture contributing to individual variation and cultural differences in our capacity to\nharm others.\nTogether, these observations of glucose-related disorders speak to a disconcerting reality: we are\nborn with inherent differences in the availability of key resources guiding self-restraint. Some of us start\noff life better equipped to control our frustrations, wait for future gains, and moderate our temper. These\nearly differences can have long lasting and disastrous effects later in life, a point supported by a study that\nbegan forty years ago with four year-old children presented with a marshmallow.\nThe American social psychologist Walter Mischel recruited four year old children to his\nlaboratory and sat them down at a table with two objects: a marshmallow and a bell. He then told each\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 130\nchild that he was going to leave the room. If they wanted to eat the marshmallow, they only had to ring\nthe bell. But, as Mischel informed them, if they waited for his return, he would bring them more\nmarshmallows. Mischel took out his stopwatch and recorded how long each child waited before ringing\nthe bell.\nSome children rang the bell almost immediately, leaving Mischel no time to leave the room.\nOthers waited. This isn’t surprising. Some children are impulsive, others are impatient, and this shows up\nearly in life. What is surprising is that these early appearing personality types held steadfast, impacting\nlater life decisions and actions. The more impatient types were more likely to be involved in juvenile\ndelinquency, have poor grades, abuse drugs, get divorced, and lose their jobs. For women who developed\neating disorders, those who were more patient were more likely to be anorexic, whereas those who were\nmore impulsive were more likely to be bulimic. When the American developmental psychologist B.J.\nCasey put these now 40-somethings inside a brain scanner, the patient ones showed stronger activation in\nthe prefrontal areas of the brain when viewing happy and fearful faces, revealing stronger self-control\nover their feelings. In contrast, when the impatient ones viewed the same stimuli, not only was there a\nweaker response in the prefrontal region but a stronger response in the ventral striatum when viewing\nhappy faces. The striatum, as noted earlier, is involved in the experience of reward. For the impatient\ntypes, seeing something positive is like eating candy, something that is hard to ignore. The patient types\nregulate this feeling, transforming the heat of the moment into a cool experience. The impatient types are\noverwhelmed by this feeling, giving into temptation. This work adds to the genetic evidence reviewed\nearlier, showcasing both the importance of individual differences in self-control, and the stability of these\ndifferences as distinctive personality types.\nIndividual differences in self-control are also relevant to levels of recidivism in youths who have\ncommitted a crime, and thus tie us back to the beginning of this chapter and the costs of a career criminal.\nCareer criminals are individuals who repeatedly commit crimes. They lack self-control. This is important\nfor judges, juries and society as we want to know in advance who is most likely to commit another crime\nif we release them back out onto the streets. The American sociologist Matt DeLisi presented a selfcontrol\nsurvey to approximately 800 juvenile youths, ages 12-17 years, each with a criminal record.\nThose who scored one standard deviation from the mean on this survey, and thus were more impulsive\nthan most, were five times more likely to become career criminals. Five times. Self-control on its own\naccounted for about 80% of the variation in recidivism among these delinquents; the remaining 20% was\naccounted for by factors that one might think would be much more important, including mental health,\neducation, gender, and socioeconomic background. As DeLisi concludes, these results suggest that\nmeasures of self-control provide a reliable predictor of the likelihood of repeating a crime. They provide a\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 131\nmeasure of risk, a factor that both juvenile and adult courts should be using to determine their sentencing,\nespecially the individual’s future dangerousness.\nIndividual differences in glucose metabolism, together with relative differences in brain activity,\nlead to stable differences in self-control. But there’s more, both luck of the draw genetic effects and\nclinical distortions. Recall that the low expressing form of the MAOA gene results in lower levels of\nserotonin which, in turn, leverages less control over aggressive impulses. There is another gene ⎯⎯\nSLC6A4 ⎯⎯ that also comes in two forms and regulates the level of serotonin. The short form of this gene\ngives you less serotonin, is commonly found in pathological gamblers and psychopaths ⎯⎯ two heavily\nmale-biased disorders that are associated with impoverished impulse control. Psychopaths also have\nrelatively smaller frontal lobes , especially within a region that has a high density of serotonin neurons.\nPsychopathy is joined by a family of impulse control disorders that also implicate dysfunction of the\nserotonin system, including kleptomania (stealing), pyromania (burning), trichotillomania (hair pulling),\nand oniomania (shopping). Like glucose, serotonin plays a lead role in our capacity for self-control.\nWhen serotonin is sidelined from the performance, any number of impulsivity problems may emerge.\nWhat I have said thus far is only a partial accounting of the biological ingredients that figure into\nour capacity for self-control. What this partial recipe tell us is that regardless of the situation, some\nindividuals are inoculated against the pull of authority and group ideology and others are susceptible. If\nyou missed the inoculation clinic in utero, you are more susceptible to temptations and excesses,\nincluding excessive violence. This is important for our interpretation of the real world and of the famous\npsychological experiments by Milgram, Zimbardo, and others in which seemingly good people carried\nout unambiguously horrid things. Some individuals carry a genetic skeleton that resists the push and pull\nof charismatic leaders and powerful isms. These people will not be pushed into doing bad things. Others,\nfaced with the exact same situation, will find their skeleton buckling, tempted to take risks and lash out\nwhen the going gets tough.\nInvisible risks\nSeveral years ago, Ira Glass, the brilliant radio show host of This American Life, delved into the topic of\nsuperheroes. One episode focused on a question that has become part of my repertoire for dinner parties,\nespecially those in need of a conversational catalyst: if you could become a superhero with one power,\nwhich would you take ⎯⎯ the ability to fly or to be invisible? Most people have a rapid-fire, confident\nresponse to this question, while others reflect a bit, often engaging themselves in a public debate over\ntheir conflicted views. What is interesting about people’s answer to this question, independently of\nwhether they pick flying or invisibility, is that they rarely talk about using their power to do good in the\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 132\nworld! The flyers talk about how cool it would be to vacation anywhere in the world, zip to work or\nschool, or have fun soaring like an eagle. The invisibility types talk about sneaking into stores and taking\nclothes or music they like, eavesdropping on conversations, and playing tricks on family members and\nfriends. What is even more interesting about these particular answers is how they divide into pure\nhedonism ⎯⎯ flying ⎯⎯ and pure vice ⎯⎯ invisibility. With invisibility you can take risks at no cost, except\nfor the cost that soon becomes apparent to many of these newly donned superheroes: even if they don’t\nget caught, they still did something bad, morally bad. This ratchets up their guilt. With this realization,\nand a dip into the dark side, comes an about face, with some picking flying instead of invisibility. Rarely\ndo people stick with invisibility, but see how they might deploy their power for virtuous purposes. Rarely\ndo these superheroes realize that they can be real heroes, using their invisibility to gain covert information\nabout terrorist organizations, elicit drug traders, pedophilic priests, or abusive parents ⎯⎯ minus the risks.\nIn real life, there are risks associated with every decision, some clear from the start and others\nonly clear in hindsight. As with self-control, a growing body of evidence shows that there are individual\ndifferences in risk-taking: some are risk-averse, some risk-prone, and some seemingly risk-blind, unaware\nthat they are taking risks at all. Some of these differences are evident early in life. Some of these\ndifferences are strongly associated with crime later in life. Some of these differences provide insights into\nthe invisible risks that individuals and societies confront, risks that can cause great harms.\nResearch on clinical populations with antisocial disorders, most notably those with a clinical\ndiagnosis of psychopathy, reveals a major cause of their high risk, costly, and violent behavior: a failure\nto experience fear, anxiety, or stress in response to highly evocative images and sounds. In contrast with\nhealthy populations, psychopaths are emotionally blasé about the things in the world that can cause harm\nor result in punishment. The problem lies in the fact that psychopaths, both adults and those identified as\ncandidates early in childhood, fail to learn about the dangers in life. Their failure to learn is caused by a\nreduction in size and activity of two critical and connected brain areas: a region of the frontal cortex and\nthe amygdala. When this system works efficiently, it allows individuals to learn about the sounds, smells,\nand sights that are associated with bad things in the world. When this system works well, individuals\nlearn to avoid antisocial, immoral, and illegal acts by developing anxiety and fear over the possibility of\npunishment and personal injury. When this system works poorly, as is the case in psychopaths,\nindividuals act as if there are no dangers or risks of punishment ⎯⎯ a disposition that enables inappropriate\nactions. But psychopathy covers a broad spectrum, with problems that all of us confront at some point in\nour lives, some of us even repeatedly. This is important as it forces us to look at non-clinical populations\nfor the causes of individual differences in risk-taking, especially our reactivity to dangerous events.\nStudies carried out over several decades, in a wide variety of cultures, reveal that children begin\nlife with distinctive temperaments. Some are mellow, blasé about events that are startling to many.\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 133\nOthers are high strung and reactive, responding with heightened fear to the same startling events. Others\nfall somewhere in between these two poles. What is surprising is the fact those with the flattest response\nto evocative images and sounds are the most likely to become violent delinquents in young adulthood.\nIn a remarkable study, Adrian Raine and his colleagues presented 1,795 three year olds with two\ndifferent sounds while recording the sweatiness of their palms; the sweatier the palms, the greater the\nstress and fear. One sound was always associated with a second and highly aversive noise, while the\nsecond sound was always played alone. When you pair a neutral sound, such as a pure tone, with a nasty\nsound, simply hearing the pure tone will make your skin crawl; the pure tone predicts what is coming, and\nwhat is coming is not pleasant. When Raine revisited these same individuals twenty years later, those with\nserious criminal records involving drug abuse, dangerous driving violations, or violence, had the driest\npalms at the age of three years. In another study, focusing specifically on violence, Raine measured the\nsweatiness of a different group of three year olds and then looked at their aggressiveness five years later.\nOnce again, those with the driest palms at three years were the most aggressive at eight years. In the\nabsence of a system that enables individuals to learn about danger, the brain and body act as if they were\nshrouded in an invisibility cloak, blind to the risks of crossing either moral or legal lines.\nRaine’s findings fit well with the marshmallow study. In the same way that those who were\nmost impatient in the pre-school years were also most likely to exhibit signs of delinquency in early\nadulthood, so too were those who were most blasé about fearful stimuli as children most likely to exhibit\ndelinquency in adulthood. Both studies reveal the stability of personality traits. Both studies suggest that\nat the level of groups of individuals, as opposed to specific individuals, the blasé-impatient types\nrepresent a greater threat to our welfare. The point about groups is important. These studies do not allow\nus to look at an individual’s record and conclude that because he could only wait for 3 seconds before\neating the lone marshmallow, and almost fell asleep when presented with loud banging noises, that he is\nwithout doubt headed for a life of crime. We also can’t conclude that because patience and reactivity to\nfearful stimuli can be measured as early as three years old, that these personality traits are entirely genetic\nand fixed. In fact, other studies carried out by Raine show that if you ramp up the nutrition, exercise, and\nmental stimulation of children between the ages of 3-5 years, you can reduce adult criminal offenses by\n35%. What we can conclude from these findings is that there are significant individual differences that\naffect who is willing to take risks and who isn’t. We can conclude that there is a strong biological\ncomponent that constrains the individual’s options. We can conclude that those who start early in life\nwithout an understanding of the dangers in the world, act as if they live in a risk-free world. Molecular\nbiologists provide an increasingly precise understanding of how these individual differences start,\npointing to genes that bias some individuals to take extreme risks, including the risk of violating social\nnorms and laws by violently attacking another human being.\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 134\nThere are many situations where taking a risk pays off, whether we think of stealth military\noperations, chancy shots in the final seconds of a basketball game, or significant investments in an up and\ncoming stock option. Playing it safe pays off. But those who stick their necks out and take a chance, may\nbring home significant gains. It is because of these competing strategies and potential payoffs that\nevolutionary biologists have imagined that selection could maintain both personality types within a\npopulation ⎯⎯ a point noted earlier for the MAOA and glucose-related genes. If selection has worked in\nthis way, then there must be genetic variation that allows for both strategies. To date, the strongest\nevidence comes from a family of genes associated with the regulation of dopamine, with the memorable\nacronyms of DAT1, DRD2 and DRD4; each of these genes is associated with different forms, each form\nassociated with different levels of dopamine. Recall from chapter 2 that dopamine plays an essential role\nin our experience of reward, including how motivated we are to get it and what we anticipate based on our\nunderstanding of the situation ⎯⎯ have we been rewarded in the past, how often, and how much? The idea\nhere is that those who carry genes that output a higher level of dopamine may weight rewards more\nheavily and thus, show risk-blindness; for these individuals, the eye is on the prize, not the path or\nobstacles to this prize.\nAcross a number of studies, results show that variation in the expression of these genes is\nassociated with high-risk, low self-control behaviors, including pathological gambling, substance abuse,\nsensation seeking, and financial investments. For example, in two separate studies, individuals with\ndifferent variants of the DRD4 gene played a financial investment game involving real money. In one,\ndesigned by Joan Chiao, subjects decided to invest in either a risky asset with variable returns or a riskless\nasset with consistent returns. In the second study, the Swedish economist Ana Dreber and the American\nanthropologist Corin Apicella allowed subjects to either walk away with an initial starting pot of money,\nor to invest some of it in a risky asset. Those with the DRD4 variant that expresses higher levels of\ndopamine were more likely to pursue the risky investment. What this work reveals is that part of the\nvariation we observe among people who make risky investments, drink too much alcohol, and gamble\nwith their income, is due to variation in the dopamine family of genes. These are hidden risks that come\nto life thanks to molecular biologist’s microscope. What also comes to life is the fact that these same\ngenes are relevant to violence, causing some to strike out even though there are significant risks and\nterrible consequences.\nIn several studies, using an American health data base of several thousand adolescents, results\nconsistently show a relationship between particular variants of the dopamine genes and violence. For\nexample, the sociologist Guang Guo examined the relationship between violent delinquency ⎯⎯ involving\nuse of guns and knives ⎯⎯ and variation in DRD2 and DAT1 among 2,5000 individuals ages 12-23 years.\nDRD2 was of particular interest because medical records and clinical trials reveal that administering\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 135\nhaloperidol ⎯⎯ a DRD2 dopamine antagonist ⎯⎯ helps control aggression in psychotic patients. Guo found\nthat levels of violence were about twice as high for one variant of the DRD2 gene than others, and about\n20% higher for a particular variant of the DAT1 gene. These genetic variants cause differences in\ndopamine, which cause differences in expected and experienced reward, which cause differences in\nperceived risk, which cause differences in the odds of getting in a fight and harming others. These are not\ngenes for aggression, violence or evil. There are no such genes. Rather, they are genes that change our\nperception of risk. Because risk is related to all sorts of decisions, these genes can affect the odds that we\ndirectly harm others. They are part of the story of individual differences, and part of the story of why\nsome are more likely to engage in evildoing.\nEverything I have discussed thus far focuses on actions, on how the psychology of desire and\ndenial combine to fuel behaviors that lead, directly or indirectly, to excessive harms. I have also explained\nhow different biological ingredients predispose us toward different degrees of self-control, and thus,\ndifferences in our ability to omit particular actions. This sense of omission is a virtue, a sign of resisting\ntemptation. But can omissions be a sign of vice, of resisting an action that is called for? Can omissions\never reach such a scale that we would consider individuals or societies as evil omitters?\nThe sin of sloth.\nWhat’s worse: 1) giving a lethal overdose to someone suffering from an incurable disease or allowing this\nperson to die by removing life support? 2) pushing someone in front of a runaway truck to stop the truck\nand save the lives of five others or allowing someone to walk in front of the truck instead of warning\nthem? 3) pouring a toxic chemical into your competitor’s drink in order to make him sick or allowing\nyour competitor to drink the toxic chemical that was placed on the table by someone else? Even though\nall of these situations seem quite bad, most people have a gut feeling that the actions are worse than the\nomissions. They also feel that when we omit life support, fail to warn someone of a runaway truck, or\nremain silent about a toxic drink, that we are less responsible for the consequences that unfold. Dozens of\nstudies, using hundreds of different examples, and thousands of subjects, support what our gut expresses:\nwe are captive to an omission effect. Even when we understand that the consequences are precisely the\nsame ⎯⎯ the suffering patient dies, the truck kills the person, the toxic chemical makes the competitor sick\n⎯⎯ and so too are the person’s goals and intentions ⎯⎯ eliminate suffering, save five people, take out the\ncompetitor ⎯⎯ we are seduced to believe that action is worse than omission or that doing harm to another\nis worse than allowing harm to occur.\nThe omission effect lays bare a tension between unconscious, spontaneous intuition and\nconscious, reflective thought. On the one hand, there are potentially good reasons why we evolved this\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 136\nintuition. It is a heuristic or rule of thumb that may be right much of the time. When I do something, as\nlong as it is not by accident, my intentions and goals are more clear cut than when I fail to do something\nor allow it to happen. If I punch you and your arm bruises, the causality is clear: I caused your arm to\nbruise. I am responsible for this harm. I should be punished. If I stand by as someone is about to punch\nyou, but don’t deflect the punch when I easily could have, it feels odd to say that I caused your arm to\nbruise. It also seems strange to say that I am responsible and should be punished. By not deflecting the\npunch, I allowed the harm to occur. I could have prevented it from happening, but I am not obliged to. As\nsocial creatures, we have been designed to pick up on cues that reliably classify people into friends and\nenemies. Friends intentionally help us while enemies intentionally harm us. Actions showcase our\nintentions better than omissions.\nThe omission effect also makes sense in terms of personal responsibility. Not only do our guts tell\nus that actors are more responsible for outcomes than omitters, but our guts also tell us that it is hard to\nhold others responsible for their omissions. As I sit and write these words, I am committing heinous acts\nof omission: I am not currently giving money to any charities, am not scheduled to teach in the dozens of\nrefugee camps around the world, and am not volunteering for any of the peace keeping armies sponsored\nby the UN. I am also guilty of many other minor crimes of omission, including the failure to consistently\ngive my change to homeless individuals, and the failure to spend time in homes for the elderly and\nmentally handicapped. As I sit, I rack up countless harms of omission. It is hopefully the absurdity of this\ncomment that shows why there is a fracture in the arm that connects omissions to responsibility. In a large\nscale society, it is impossible for us to hold people responsible for their omissions. There are far too many\nreasons, often good ones, why people don’t act. The universe of reasons for acting is smaller.\nIf the omission effect arises because it is virtually impossible to hold omitters responsible in a\nlarge scale society, than what about small scale societies including the hunter-gathers of our past, and the\ntiny hamlets and villages that dot many countries, both developed and developing? When the number of\npeople that you know and interact with is small, does the omission effect vanish? In a fish bowl\ncommunity, you should be able to hold all of the other fish responsible for their actions and omissions\nbecause you know what they are up to. To explore this idea, the psychologist Linda Abarbanell and I ran\na study with a rural, small scale Mayan population, living in the Chiapas region of Mexico. Every\nindividual listened to a reading of a moral dilemma. Each dilemma described an action or an omission\nthat resulted in harming one person, but saving the lives of many. Subjects judged the moral\npermissibility of the action or omission.\nUnlike thousands of adults on the internet who judged similar dilemmas, as well as other Mayans\nliving in a city, individuals in this small scale Mayan population perceived no moral difference between\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 137\nactions and omissions. The omission effect evaporated, with the moral weight of an action perceived to\nbe on a par with an omission.\nThe Mayan study is but one example. It suggests some flexibility in our perception of actions and\nomissions, and shows how cultural differences can create individual differences. When our social world is\nrelatively small and circumscribed, we can keep tabs on everyone. By keeping tabs, we can hold others\nresponsible for their actions and their omissions. As the American psychologists Jon Haidt and Jonathan\nBaron have shown, this psychology can be recreated in the laboratory by creating scenarios in which the\nindividuals are either unfamiliar or familiar. When there is a relationship between the individuals ⎯⎯\nfamily, friends, team members ⎯⎯ and thus, some degree of familiarity, the omission effect weakens.\nThe omission effect is not an obligatory state of the human mind. It is a common tendency, a way\nthat our brains lean, especially in unfamiliar contexts. In patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, the\nomission effect is as strong as it is in healthy subjects, except for familiar cases of harm that are directly\nrelevant to them, such as the excessive washing behavior that is the trademark of this clinical disorder.\nThe fact that certain situations can cause us to lean in different directions has important policy\nimplications: even when corporations, institutions, or other organizations grow large, we should always\nsegregate these masses into smaller divisions, and make the issues personally relevant. Every member of\none division should hold all others within its division responsible or accountable. Further, efforts should\nbe made to foster familiarity across divisions, enabling not only a level of responsibility but of respect\nand trust. By recreating the psychology of small scale societies, and making potential harms relevant, we\nmay help bypass the omission effect, allowing us to hold people responsible for their omissions. This, in\nturn, may reduce the number of individuals who live as passive bystanders. Familiarity and relevance\nmay well be the necessary catalysts for converting bystanders into active whistle blowers, defenders, and\nrescuers.\nWhen bystanders remain passive, watching the world go by, it is often because they believe that\ntheir actions won’t make a difference or think that the costs of heroism are too high. This is, again, an\nissue of responsibility. It raises the question of when we ought to act. The distinguished Australian\nphilosopher Peter Singer has spent a lifetime pushing this issue in the context of charitable donations,\nculminating most recently in his book The Life You Can Save. The key idea, taken from a utilitarian\nperspective where outcomes as opposed to rules or principles motivate our moral actions, is that we ought\nto give a fraction of our incomes to those lacking basic access to food, shelter and health care. Standing\nby as bystanders when there are 1.4 billion people in a state of abject poverty is morally wrong. The logic\nseems perfectly reasonable, especially given the fact that humanitarian organizations have helped reduce\nthe number of people living in poverty by .5 billion within the last 20 years. But then we learn of another\nPeter Singer idea: if the three richest men alive today ⎯⎯ Carlos Slim Helu, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 138\n⎯⎯ worth a total of 153.5 billion dollars, were to give up one third of their net worth, they could solve\nworld hunger. On a personal level, they would barely notice this donation. With this knowledge, why\nshould I bother to give a penny? This is one example of apathy regarding our motivation to help others.\nWhat propels individuals to shift from passive bystanders who can allow harm to occur to active\ncontributors?\nClassic studies by the American psychologists John Darley and Bibb Latane reveal the\ningredients for bystander action. Whether it is helping someone having a seizure, being molested, or in\ndanger of suffocation from smoke, we are more likely to help when alone than when in a group. We are\nalso more likely to help when we recognize the situation as a crisis and think that there are plausible\nsolutions. These are all characteristics of the situation. There are also characteristics of the individual\nbystander, including their level of compassion and empathy toward others, their capacity to identify with\nthe victim, and their self-control. For example, people who intervene in cases of child abuse, as opposed\nto the passive bystanders, are more likely to have been abused as children, more likely to perceive a\nsolution, more likely to feel responsibility to intervene, and more likely to experience the weight of guilt\nfor not intervening. We are back to individuals differences. We are back to the egg and coop, and their\njoint contribution to helping or harming others. We are back to the established genetic differences in\ncompassion, risk-taking, and self-control that combine with a history of experience to create some who sit\nand watch and others who actively participate.\nWe are more likely to pardon bystanders because we tend to see omissions as less bad than\nactions, and omitters as less responsible for the consequences than actors. This is a dangerous effect.\nBystanders are part of the equation of evil. As noted by the American genocide scholar and psychologist,\nErvin Staub, bystanders start out as passive players on the side lines, but are rapidly transformed into\nperpetrators. The transformation starts with the challenge of maintaining passivity while watching other\nhumans suffer; to maintain this observer status requires suppressing empathy for the sufferers, while\nrecognizing that they are in the minority and you, the bystander, are with the majority. To avoid feeling\nguilty for not feeling empathy, bystanders distance themselves even further from the victims. Distancing\nis an adaptive response as any association with the victims could put a bystander in harm’s way. But like\nso many other psychological states discussed in this book, distancing leads to dehumanization.\nDehumanization leads to moral disengagement and greater justification for the perpetrators. Justification\nlends cheering support for violence. This is the final transforming step, from passive bystander to active\nparticipant.\nRecall that on my account of evil, evildoers either have a desire to cause harm directly or desire\nsomething good, recognizing that it will cause harm indirectly. This is true of actions and omissions. For\nexample, keeping a secret, even if pressured into spilling the beans, is a good thing because it upholds a\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 139\npromise, and thus, the relationship. But if keeping the secret results in innocent lives lost or ruined, then\nthis is a bad thing. Not telling ⎯⎯ an omission ⎯⎯ indirectly can cause harm. This is the situation that has\nconfronted the Catholic Church over the past twenty years.\nDuring the tenures of Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, some 4,000 priests sexually abused\nsome 10,000 innocent children. This is unquestionably an underestimate. This is excessive harm. Popes\nJohn Paul II and Benedict XVI , together with their cardinals and bishops, assumed the role of bystanders.\nThey were aware of the rampant cases of child rape among the clergy. They could have acted. Their\nomissions are archetypal examples of the sin of sloth. By omission, they are responsible for excessive\nharm and should be held legally accountable. This process has begun as evidenced by the decision in\nOctober of 2011 to indict Bishop Robert Finn for failing to report a priest who took pornographic\nphotographs of young girls. Though Finn was only charged with a misdemeanor, this case opens opens a\nlegal floodgate. It is an opening that should allow prosecutors, around the globe, to indict bishops,\ncardinals, and the Pope for evil omissions. It should empower the parents and children who have suffered\nto rise up and demand justice for allowing excessive harm to occur. It should cause everyone to express\noutrage over the fact that allowing priests to rape innocent children perpetuates a cycle of pedophiles as\nthose who have been abused are likely to abuse others. The leaders of the church have not only commited\na crime of omission, but have helped perpetuate a culture of harm.\nHauser Chapter 4.

Wicked in waiting 143\nEpilogue:\nEvilightenment\nEducate your children to self-control, to the habit of holding passion and prejudice and\nevil tendencies subject to an upright and reasoning will, and you have done much to\nabolish misery from their future and crimes from society.\n— Benjamin Franklin\nCharles Darwin observed that of all the differences between humans and other animals, one capacity\nreigns supreme: we alone have the ability to contemplate what others ought to do. We alone are endowed\nwith a moral imperative to reflect, consider, and imagine alternatives. We alone are impelled to be\ndissatisfied with the status quo, urged to contemplate what could be and ultimately what must be. This\ncapacity creates a fundamental principle of human existence and enlightenment: we alone invest in the\nsurvival of the least fit. We give money to those in abject poverty, risk our lives to help others in areas of\nconflict, adopt abandoned children, nurture individuals with extreme disabilities, and care for the elderly.\nThis principle fuels our humanitarian efforts. Sadly, it is a necessary response to another unique\ndifference between humans and other animals: we alone have the ability to inflict great harms on our own\nspecies and many others. We alone are responsible for creating work for those in the humanitarian sector.\nWe alone are evil.\nWe also have an opportunity to begin a new volume of humane history. We have the chance to\nharness our understanding of the past in order to present our children with the gift of knowledge and the\nprospects of a healthier future. We should ⎯⎯ no, we must ⎯⎯ teach our children what we have learned\nabout the causes of corporate corruption, the desire for ethnic cleansing, and the combined forces of\nnature and nurture to create excessive suffering and lifeless flesh. These are topics that should be\npresented early on in education rather than waiting for heady discussions at the university. We owe the\nnext generation the best education from our generation. The best education will come from confronting\nhistory, exposing human nature, and supporting cultural variation while fighting to demolish totalitarian\nregimes that limit or eliminate basic human rights. I write this sentence following on the eve of Egypt's\ninspiring revolution, a revolution led by educated people who refused to allow the dictator Hosni\nMubarak to ruin their country and their children's future. The people of Egypt, like the people of many\ncountries who rallied in the Arab spring of 2011, refused to be eternal victims. This is a lesson that must\nspread to every corner of the globe. It is a lesson of hope. It is a lesson to all evildoers to beware.\nI have taken you on a journey into evil’s core, penetrating with scientific evidence and\nexplanation. Though we have traveled to distant lands, traversed vast spans of time, and encountered\nwildly different cultures, the key idea is that this richness was generated from a few essential ingredients.\nThis is a minimalist approach to a difficult and highly variegated problem. I end our journey by taking\nstock of the essential ideas and reflect on some of the broader implications.\nRetracing our steps\nIn the beginning, before there were bald, bipedal, big-brained, babbling humans, there were hairy,\nquadrupedal, bitsy-brained, barking bonobos. These animals, clearly clever, have survived for over 6-7\nmillion years, despite attempts by our species to demolish their habitat. But ⎯⎯ and this is a significant\nHauser Epilogue. Evilightenment 144\nbut ⎯⎯ in the millions of years that encompass their evolutionary history, bonobos have remained virtually\nunchanged. They are still hairy, quadrupedal, bitsy-brained and barking. They still live in the jungles of\nAfrica. Not a single bonobo, or its close relative the chimpanzee, has ever taken a step out of Africa the\nway that members of our species did some 60-100,000 years ago. In fact, not a single bonobo or\nchimpanzee has ever ventured across national borders within the continent to explore new opportunities\nor develop new cultures. Not a single bonobo or chimpanzee has even moved out of the forests and on to\nthe beaches or deserts or alpine environments of Africa. Not one. When we took our steps out of Africa,\nwe did so with confidence, ready to tackle new environments, create novel tools, engage in rituals to\ncommemorate the dead, build fires to cook food and keep warm, join hands with unrelated strangers in\nthe service of cooperation, and create oral histories that could be passed on to generations of children.\nWhat enabled this celebratory migration was a cerebral migration. Not only did our brain get much\nbigger than the one housed within bonobo and chimpanzee skulls, it evolved into an engine that generates\nan unlimited combination of thoughts and feelings. We uniquely evolved a promiscuous brain.\nWhat does promiscuity buy? In a word: “creativity.” It enables regions of the brain that evolved\nfor highly specialized functions to intermingle with other regions of the brain to create new ways of\nthinking and new ways of experiencing what we see, hear, touch, taste and feel. A promiscuous brain\npaved the way for awe-inspiring bursts of creativity in art, music, literature and science. A promiscuous\nbrain enabled Bach and Bono, Picasso and Pollock, Shakespeare and Shaw, and Descartes and Darwin. A\npromiscuous brain enables us to imagine things we have never directly experienced, to create once\nunimaginable worlds, including blissful heavens and living hells. My focus in this book has been the\ninfernos we create for other human beings, here on this earth. What I have argued is that we got here by\naccident.\nWhen our brains allowed us to combine familiar thoughts and feelings to create virgin ideas, it\nenabled us to feel good about doing bad. It enabled us to incur the costs of punishing others while reaping\nthe rewards of marching to the moral high ground. It enabled us to solve the problem of large scale\ncooperation with unrelated strangers. This was a fundamental breakthrough in mental life, a spectacular\nbenefit, and the target of strong selection. But benefits often carry hidden costs. When punishment\ntriggered a honey hit to the brain, violence and reward formed an eternal bond. We now carry the burden\nof a brain that engages in denial in order to satisfy our desires. When these concepts couple, the odds of\nconceiving excessive harms is virtually guaranteed. Sometimes this malicious offspring is intended and\nat other times it is foreseen. Either way, the world has been populated with evildoers in waiting. Either\nway, our world hosts a species that has the creative capacity to financially ruin, mutilate, rape, burn,\ntorture, and extinguish millions of lives. Often, this potential is realized.\nMy aim in this book has been to explain evil to better understand its origins, not to justify or\npromote it. My aim has been to explain evil to clarify its root cause, to alert others to its early warning\nsigns, and to pave the way to a more humane existence. I have suggested that evil, expressed in the form\nof excessive harms, is caused by two ingredients: desire and denial. These are psychological states. On\ntheir own, they are often inert. When combined, they are often explosive.\nDesires. We all have them, from birth till death, from a desire for perpetual maternal warmth to a\ndesire for eternal life. Some of our desires change over the course of our lives while others stay the same.\nWe all desire good health and happiness. We differ, however, in what counts as good health and\nhappiness. Many of us experience, at least once in our life, the desire to harm another. Our desire to harm\nranges from the mundane ⎯⎯ uttering a sarcastic comment about someone’s looks or telling a racist joke\n⎯⎯ to the horrific ⎯⎯ creating corrupt corporate schemes or policies of ethnic cleansing. Sometimes what\nwe desire is rather benign, but linked to foreseeable atrocities. Sometimes our desires are toxic, as when\nwe plot to extinguish a culturally distinctive group. On one reading, President George W. Bush may well\nhave initiated the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as retaliatory attacks on terrorists, designed to protect\nAmerican interests and well-being. But he brought much of our nation on board by weaving a web of lies\nand feeding a cowboy mentality of revenge rather than nurturing compassion and understanding. The\nconsequences, clearly foreseen at the time, have been excessive. As a nation, we did not pursue an eyefor-an-eye\nrevenge. We had a different algorithm in mind, on the order of 30,000 eyes for an eye.\nHauser Epilogue. Evilightenment 145\nApproximately 3,000 innocent victims died in the 9-11 attacks. As of early 2011, some where between\n900,000 to over a million soldiers and civilians have died in Afghanistan and Iraq due to the war. This is\nexcessive. This is no longer revenge. This is senseless brutality.\nOn one reading, Pope Benedict XVI kept his knowledge of pedophilic priests quiet and\nconfidential in order to forgive them and protect the church. But this seemingly benign desire led to a\ndisaster, one that was foreseeable: continued sexual assault on thousands of innocent children and for\nmany, a loss of trust in the church and their moral and spiritual leader.\nDiscoveries by molecular biologists, neuroscientists, and psychologists reveal important\nindividual differences in our capacity to fuel desire, differences that constrain the paths we take from birth\nuntil our last breath. Some individuals are more risk-prone, some are impatient, and some gain a greater\nhit of dopamine in anticipation of reward, thereby doping themselves on the brain’s pharmaceutical\nofferings. Some are born with a set of genes that diminish the capacity for self-control. These individuals\nstart with lower levels of serotonin. These individuals, if raised by abusive parents, have a higher\nprobability of taking someone’s head off if they are challenged. Some individuals are born with low\nstress levels. These individuals are more likely to be sensation-seekers, voracious desirers who will stop\nat nothing less than the spectacular, even if this means the spectacularly violent. None of these biological\ncatalysts operate in a vacuum. All of these biological catalysts feed off of particular environments that we\ncreate. Geological and climatic factors create savannahs, oceans, and mountains. We create slums,\nrefugee camps, and totalitarian regimes. We are responsible for creating toxic environments and equally\nresponsible for cleaning them up. How we think about individual responsibility in cases of brain damage,\ndevelopmental disorders or innate differences in the starting state of our neurochemistry is a different\nproblem, one that I will touch upon in the last section.\nDenial. We all engage in it, at least some of the time. Like the psychology of desire, our\nengagement with denial is sometimes benign and often beneficial as a coping mechanism. We\ndehumanize in order to buffer ourselves from the pain of another’s pain. We self-deceive in the service of\nboosting self-confidence and self-esteem. When doctors turn their patients into machines that require\nrepair, they have deployed an adaptive mechanism that keeps empathy at bay when it is unnecessary.\nGood doctors, the ones that we all want, turn empathy back on when their patients awake from surgery,\nflesh and blood pulsating, thoughts and emotions humming. Bad doctors never turn empathy back on.\nEvil doctors, such as Carl Clauberg who injected liquid acid in the uterus of Jewish prisoners as part of a\nNazi inspired sterilization program, not only lack empathy for their patients, but see them as vermin or\nparasites that require extermination in the name of science and the preservation of our species. Denial has\ntransformed other human beings into nonhuman forms, from inert objects to wild animals and parasites.\nDenial has allowed military leaders and airplane pilots to ignore clear signs of trouble, marching\nthousands to their death. When this happens, moral responsibility checks out. Denial provides individuals\nand nations with a certified license to maim, rape, burn, mutilate and kill without feeling guilt, shame or\nremorse.\nAs with desire, the sciences provide a rich offering of evidence to explain how and why we\nengage in denial, either by means of dehumanizing others or self-deceiving ourselves. Both\ndehumanization and self-deception have a clear evolutionary logic. Dehumanization is a mechanism that\nenhances an individual’s competitive edge by making hatred and killing easier. Hatred and killing are the\nessential and ancient ingredients for defending the in-group and effacing the out-group. Sometimes,\nsoldiers would rather avoid killing the enemy. But when dehumanization of the enemy takes hold in the\nmind of a soldier or civilian, killing is not only easy, but addictive. The brain’s inhibitory mechanisms,\nprocessed by circuitry in the frontal lobes, shut down. Other brain regions involved in working out what\npeople believe and intend, enter into hibernation. With these circuits on leave, so too is our moral\nconscience. When the mind runs its dehumanization software, abstinence from killing is like withdrawal\nfrom a drug. Killing is satisfying. Killing is delicious.\nSelf-deception evolved in the service of deception. By functionally fooling ourselves into\nbelieving that we are stronger, wiser, and more competent, we can convince others to go along for the\nride, to work for us or work against a fictional enemy. Like dehumanization, this has both adaptive and\nHauser Epilogue. Evilightenment 146\nmaladaptive consequences. Brain imaging studies show that different circuits turn on when we lie about\nlong held personal stories as opposed to lies about in-the-moment situations. When we distort reality,\neither omitting information or twisting it to create a false belief, we have to inhibit the way things are to\ncreate an illusion of the way we wish them to be. In each case, there is conflict between one version of\nreality and another. In each case, the electrical and chemical choreography of the brain recruits its\nbraking mechanism, stifling one piece of knowledge in the service of lifting another to the surface of our\nlips. We perfect this capacity over the course of development. Some are born lacking this capacity.\nOthers have a system that is out of control, unable to distinguish truths from falsehoods. Somewhere\nalong this spectrum are healthy members of society who have the potential to justify themselves and a\nsociety of willing listeners about the importance of becoming willing executioners, a phrase coined by the\nhistorian Daniel Goldhagen to describe Germans involved in the Holocaust.\nDesire + Denial. We all carry out this sum easily, often automatically and unconsciously. When\nwe are pushed by a desire to eliminate others or to achieve some other goal, we call on denial to justify\nboth extraordinary means and exceptional ends. We convince ourselves that we are morally in the right\nand that extermination or manipulation are our only options. We convince ourselves that the other is an\nobject or animal, emotionally inert or unrecognizable. We shrink our moral circle, creating a culture of\nindifference. We convince ourselves through self-deception that the other is a threat. When we feel\nthreatened, we raise our hackles in self-defense. When self-defense steps forward it recruits violence,\njustified by the belief that fighting back is not only right, but obligatory. Once violence starts, supported\nby a moral imperative, uncontrollable escalation follows, leaving a trail of dead bodies, raped women, and\nabducted children. Desire couples with denial. Once this liaisons forms, it evolves, grows and feeds on\nitself. We have arrived at excessive harms. We have arrived at evil.\nWhat can we do? How can we harness our understanding of evil to predict when it might occur\nagain? Can we reduce future danger?\nFuture dangerousness\nWhy do we allow 16 year olds to drive in many parts of the United States, but prevent them from drinking\nalcohol until 21 and from renting a car until 25? Why must the President of the United States be at least\n35 years old, but members of the House of Representatives can enter at 25? If 16 is the magic number for\ndriving, why isn't it also the magic number for drinking, voting, becoming president, marrying without\nparental consent, joining the military, and being executed for a felony murder? Or why not make 21 the\nmagic age for all age-restricted behaviors and positions? This would make sense in terms of our biology:\nit is precisely around the age of 21 that our frontal lobes have matured more completely, thereby\nproviding us with a more functional engine for self-control. Or, why not question why we have a legal age\nat all? Why not have a brain scan for frontal lobe maturation along with a test for self-control that would\nallow some pre-16 year olds to drive, but might prevent some post-21 year olds from drinking? And if\nyou are in favor of the death penalty ⎯⎯ I'm not ⎯⎯ than why not detach it from age altogether and look at\nthe individual's moral competence and capacity for self-control?\nThese are hard questions. How we answer them will have resounding implications for law and\nsociety. When a legal system decides that someone can drive, drink, vote, kill, run for president, marry,\nand die as a penalty for crime, it has constrained human behavior based on a statistical evaluation of\npsychological capacity. In each case, our assignment of age-appropriateness indicates that we believe the\nperson is responsible for his or her actions and thus, his or her future actions. It also indicates that those\nunder age are not responsible for their actions. We grant permission to drive at 16 years of age because\nwe believe that most 16 years olds are capable of driving responsibly, now and in the future. We believe\nthat a person who committed a heinous crime at the age of 18 is responsible for harming others and is\nlikely to do so in the future. He or she is thus eligible for the death penalty, at least in some states within\nthe United States. In contrast, we believe that someone at the age of 17 is still developing and has the\npotential to change. In this sense, we hold them less responsible for their actions.\nHauser Epilogue. Evilightenment 147\nLooking out at the tapestry of age-limited situations reveals a rather eclectic pastiche. In many of\nthese cases, the cut-off age seems both arbitrary and inappropriate given the statistics. Consider the legal\ndriving age. Is it the case that 16 year olds are responsible drivers? 16 years olds have higher crash rates\nthan any other age group in the United States, are more likely to die in a car crash than the average of all\nother age groups, and car crashes are the leading cause of death among 16 year olds. North Dakotans\nbelieve that 14 year olds can drive a car. They may have fewer drivers on the road, but that doesn’t mean\nthat a 14 year old won’t hit them or drive off the road after irresponsibly drinking. Why not keep all\nyouths off the road until 21 when the statistics on fatal car crashes drop? Or why not follow the lead of\ncar rental agencies and wait for the 25 th birthday?\nThere are at least two common answers to the driving age problem, both utilitarian: in farming\ncommunities, and other environments where children work with their parents, it is essential to have\nchildren driving as soon as possible; and throughout the country, many parents look forward to the day\nwhen their children can drive, thereby alleviating the need for their private chauffeur service. There is no\nquestion that these are benefits. But if the cost is death to the child and others, the economics just don’t\nwork out. One option would be to lower the legal driving age for those communities or situations in\nwhich parents demonstrate the significance of young children driving for their financial security and well\nbeing. Those without this justification must wait until they are 21, frontal lobes matured and the novelty\nof intoxication lowered.\nThe most interesting and relevant age-related issue is when someone is treated as an adult as\nopposed to a juvenile criminal. Within the United States, most states set the bar at 18 years, but some as\nyoung as 16. Where a state sets its bar determines whether or not the individual is eligible for the death\npenalty or a life sentence, as well as a host of social services. Many states with the bar currently set\nbelow 18, including my own state of Massachusetts, are presently debating whether the age limit should\nbe raised. For some, the issue is simply one of parity: this is not an issue where states should differ, and\nthus everyone should be with the majority at 18 years. Others add to this discussion by arguing that it\nshould be 18 because of brain maturation. Although it is absolutely the case that a more mature brain\nbrings with it better self-control and less sensation-seeking or risk-taking, there is no evidence of a\nreliable difference between 16, 17 and 18 year olds. Some 16 year olds are remarkably patient and riskaverse\nwhereas some 18 years olds are remarkably impulsive and risk-prone. If this is to be a meaningful\ndiscussion about future risks, plasticity, and the opportunity for rehabilitation, it will have to grapple with\nthe scientific evidence that is presently on offer.\nWhen we use age to distinguish between legally permissible and forbidden actions, we have\nacknowledged that our biology and upbringing represent mitigating factors. We believe that juvenile\ncrimes are forgivable and their actions correctable. In fact, their crimes are forgivable because their\nactions are correctable. Once we admit nature and nurture into the legal calculus concerning our youths,\nwe must also allow such factors to guide our decisions about adults with developmental disorders, brain\ndamage, and different genetic make-up. Yet, the law seems to have a double standard: youths lack free\nwill, whereas adults have it, even if it is somewhat diminished. But if we believe that juveniles lack a\nsufficiently mature capacity for self-control, planning and thinking about alternative options, then we\nmust recognize that fully mature adults can lose these capacities as they naturally age, and can lose them\nat any age if they suffer from brain damage. We must also wrestle with the fact that some people are born\nwith a genetic constitution that makes them more vulnerable to addictions, sensation-seeking, violence,\nand a lack of compassion. Perhaps they too should be banned from driving, voting, drinking, marrying\nand military combat. When do we look at the excessive harms caused by individuals or groups and hold\nthem responsible? When do we punish them to pay for their crimes and fend off future atrocities?\nThe law often invokes the notion of future dangerousness as a means of evaluating risk. So too\ndoes the public and media. The general presumption is that for certain kinds of offences, there is a\npredictably high level of recidivism, of doing the same thing over and over again. But the implication of\nthis judgment is that those who are deemed guilty are, in some way, not responsible for their future. Their\nfuture is determined for them. In fact, it is so determined that the law is willing to make a confident\nwager and send these criminals to prison or to their death. On this view, someone who has already\nHauser Epilogue. Evilightenment 148\nrepeated a crime is more likely to repeat than someone who has only committed a crime once. On this\nview, those who engage in certain kinds of crimes, such as child molesters and rapists, are more likely to\nrepeat because it is “in” their system. Unfortunately, both folk perception and legal analysis of future\ndangerousness are based on weak evidence, unfounded assumptions, or both.\nConsider sexual offenders. Their crime is intentional, frequently repeated, and aimed at innocent\nvictims. Given that many sexual offenders repeat their offenses, it has the appearance of inevitability, of\na process that is highly determined. Because many sexual offenders were abused as children, some\nexperts conclude that we should blame their parents. Other experts believe that particular situations either\npromote or support sexual offenders, including the church and medical exam rooms. And yet other\nexperts, including the psychiatrist Boris Schiffer, reveal brain differences among pedophiles, including\nespecially the areas involved in reward and self-control. Together, these observations suggest that the\ncombination of a deviant nature and toxic nurture have led to a more deterministic universe. In this\nuniverse, sexual offenses are inevitable or so highly probable that we should lock up offenders and post\ntheir crimes in every county’s registry, and if possible, as replacements for flamingo lawn art.\nIf this assessment of sexual offenders is right, how should we think about responsibility, blame,\nand punishment. If sexual offenders can’t help themselves, how should we assign blame? How should we\nassign an appropriate level and form of punishment, if punishment is even appropriate? Studies of\nrecidivism among sexual offenders generate rates as low as 15% and as high as 80%. These studies also\nreveal that recidivism rates differ for incest perpetrators, rapists, and child molesters. These numbers tell\nus that even child molesters don’t always repeat their crimes. They also tell us that sexual offences should\nnot be lumped, but split apart into their underlying causes and triggers. Like the high odds favoring a\nhorse with a distinguished lineage and top rated jockey, there are high odds favoring repeated sexual\nmolestation in an individual who was sexually abused as a child and enters the clergy. Does this mean\nthat we should all bet on this one horse or forget the race altogether? Does this mean that we should lock\nup the priest before he has an opportunity to enter his parish? No and No. Neither horse racing nor sexual\nmolestation are that easily determined. Future success and future dangerousness are probabilistic. They\nrepresent our best guesses. When the law determines that someone is at high risk of committing a future\noffense, it doesn’t really care whether the individual is perfectly healthy or brain damaged. It cares about\nrisk. In terms of blame and punishment, however, the law cares about the perpetrator’s brain. The law\ncares about a person’s capacity to act rationally and independently. It is this capacity that allows us to\nassign responsibility. It is this capacity that drives many theories of blame and punishment, including the\nAustralian legal scholar Michael Moore’s massive treatise Placing Blame. These are reasons why\nscientific understanding of future dangerousness is important for law and society.\nArmed with these ideas about future dangerousness, we can return to the list of potential evildoers\nthat I mentioned in the prologue. This list included individuals who caused relatively minor harms such as\nReverend Lawrence Murphy and Charles Manson, as well as those who committed much more major\nharms such as Idi Amin and Mao Zedong. Whether we consider these individuals and their acts as evil is\northogonal to the fact that each one posed a great risk to society. Each of these individuals would have\nbeen judged as high risk for causing future danger. Only some of these individuals should have been\npunished if punishment is guided by our understanding of responsibility and blame. Only those\nindividuals who can take responsibility for their actions and change should be punished. On this view, all\nof the dictators were rightly blamed and punished. And so too were Jane Toppan, Bernard Madoff, and\nCharles Granger. In contrast, although Lawrence Murphy should have been locked up as opposed to\nexiled to a cottage, both Murphy and Charles Manson are more difficult to assess in terms of\nresponsibility, and thus, the appropriateness of punishment. No one would want them walking the streets\ntoday, free to rape innocent children or create a cult of murderers. But for the law to evolve, we need\nbetter tools to evaluate the biological underpinnings of diminished capacity. These measures, still in the\nearly stages of development, will help refine our understanding of risk, guide our clinical interventions,\nand contribute to the construction of a safer society.\nAs we move forward, we must also recognize the rapidly changing landscape, and the future\ndangerousness of globalization, especially its capacity to breed evildoers. Like authority, conformity,\nHauser Epilogue. Evilightenment 149\ndehumanization, and self-deception which each have both beneficial and toxic personalities, so too does\nglobalization. Globalization has integrated developing countries into the global economy and allowed\nthem to profit from new resources and advances. But globalization has also fragmented these countries\nby giving them access to resources that corrupt, such as arms for guerrilla leaders and rogue armies. What\nhas changed in the twenty-first century, perhaps as early as the 1990s, is a new form of war, one that is\ntied to the signature of evil and its expression as excessive harm. No longer are wars confined to state\nborders, restricted to states and their legitimized militaries, financed by governments and tax revenues,\nand focused on combatants. Instead, the new wars of the twenty-first century have entirely porous\nboundaries, are funded by private organizations, run by grass-root groups, and motivated by the use of\nhorrific means to achieve equally horrific ends, including torture, rape, mutilation, and the use and abuse\nof civilians, women, children and men alike. As a result, international law is effectively, ineffective.\nThose running these new wars are outside of international law.\nThe consequence of the new wars extends beyond the travesties experienced by those living in\nthese hot spots to the humanitarian aid workers and journalists who attempt to help the victims.\nHumanitarian aid is often pirated by rogue militias, and journalists are frequently killed or badly injured.\nWe must therefore face the sad reality that as we ended the twentieth-century and initiated the twentyfirst,\ncasualties to non-combatant civilians shifted from few to many. We must face the reality that\ncombating evil will require new laws and new protections for those who risk their lives to aid victims and\ngive voice to their often silent suffering.\nEvil ever after?\nWe won't eradicate evil. Why? Because the capacity for evil is rooted in human nature, born of a\npromiscuous mind that enables ideas and feelings to flip between beneficial and toxic. Though we\ninstitute programs and practices that promote the beneficial, living within every human mind is a toxic\nneighbor, waiting to move in. Adhering to authorities is beneficial in that great leaders are energizing,\nempowering, creative, and a source of guidance into a brighter future. But even great leaders can turn\ntoxic, imposing corrosive ideologies and eliminating basic human rights. Conformity is beneficial in that\nwe want to live in a society where norms are followed, providing stability and cooperation. But\nconformity is toxic when it leads to blind faith and uncritical thinking. Dehumanization is beneficial in\nallowing us to carry out medical procedures and live with certain kinds of human suffering. But\ndehumanization is toxic when it facilitates ethnic cleansing by shrinking the moral circle, turning\natrocities into virtuous offerings. Tolerance and pluralism are beneficial in that they lead to respect and\nconcern for others’ attitudes and desires. But tolerance and pluralism are toxic when they breed apathy\nand a willingness to stand by as passive bystanders.\nMy diagnosis of evil is not meant to be defeatist, but realist. It is only through an\nacknowledgment of our biology and the environments it has created ⎯⎯ and can create ⎯⎯ that we can look\nfor solutions to ameliorate the human condition. We are all vulnerable to walking on the wrong side. We\nare fallible. We are also enormously creative, capable of great change. Like no other species, we\nrelentlessly seek novelty. No one wants to be like his or her predecessor. Whether it is a new culinary\ntradition, extreme sport, technological innovation, musical genre, or weapon of destruction, our search for\nnovelty is an indestructible component of human nature.\nOur journey into the nature of evil has come to an end. Bombarded by the sheer magnitude of\nlives lost or damaged beyond repair, it is natural to deaden our senses and choke our feelings in the hope\nof finding solitude and peace. As painful as a re-awakening is, we must remember the individuals that\nmake up these massive atrocities. Reflecting upon the loss of his son who was murdered by the Lord's\nResistance Army, an 80 year old Ugandan chief summed it up ⎯⎯ \"We have been forgotten. It’s as if we\ndon’t exist.\"\nWe must never forget. We must never deny our potential to cause horrific pain and suffering\nwhile finding ways to forgive and express deep compassion. We must never give up on humanity.\nHauser Epilogue. Evilightenment 150\nEndnotes: Epilogue\nRecommended Books:\nGlover, J. (2000). Humanity. Yale University Press.\nGrossman, D. (1996). On Killing.
