  "text": "114 Teaching Minds\n\nvery small. We keep learning about walking throughout our lives be-\ncause things change.\n\nBabies predict what will happen when they cry. They don’t start\nout making such predictions. They learn to expect results that they\nhave already experienced. These are scripts, and I have discussed them\nat length elsewhere.’ Scripts are acquired naturally as a result of re-\npeated sequences of events. We predict what will happen next because\nwe know the script. Scripts are not normally taught because they are\nreadily acquired from living. But what if you want to teach them? You\nmight want to teach them in a situation where someone’s new job is\na script and rather than learn that job from repeated experience, there\nis a desire to jump-start the process by simply teaching the script. How\ncan we do this?\n\nThere is also prediction that is not script-based. In other words,\nthere could well be a script but the predictor doesn’t know it. How can\none learn to predict well if one does not have a script?\n\nAnd lastly, there is often the need to predict when there couldn't\npossibly be a script because what needs to be predicted is novel, at\nleast to the predictor. How can the prediction be made? More impor-\ntant, how can someone be taught to predict in that kind of situation?\n\nThese, then, are the three aspects of prediction: learning a script;\nfunctioning without a script because it isn’t known; and predicting\nwhen there is no script.\n\nHow do we teach these things? Scripts are learned through repeti-\ntion. No one seeks to explain to a child that since she will be doing\nsomething again and again, she will now memorize the steps before\nshe tries it out for the first time. Instead, we take the child through\nthe steps until she has learned them. There is no need to try to teach a\nchild scripts (such as how restaurants function or airplane rides go or\nschool procedure works). We can say some words about these things,\nof course, but the learning comes from repeated practice no matter\nwhat we do.\n\nTeachers (and course designers) often fail to understand about\nteaching scripts. Talking about what a student will have to do later will\nnot help that student do what he is being asked to do. We don’t learn\nscripts consciously and thus aren’t likely to remember what we are\nconsciously told about what to do. We are conscious when we execute\na script—we are thinking about what will happen next—but not so\nmuch in words as in expectations of next events. We don’t talk about\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023860",
