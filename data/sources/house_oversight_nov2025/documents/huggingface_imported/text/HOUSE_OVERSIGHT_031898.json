He’s a rare\ntriple threat in public-intellectual life — maintaining high\nappointments in academe, producing popular books and magazine\nwriting consumed by the chattering classes, and advising American\npresidents and foreign leaders directly. He combines expertise and\ninfluence with breadth: He’s worked on questions as imperial as\nAmerican grand strategy and as delicate and abstract as bioethics.\nHe’s most famous for The End of History and the Last Man, whose\nperennially misunderstood title is often jeered, but which defined a\ndecade’s thinking about the post-Cold War world order and\nglobalization. His latest book is Origins of Political Order, which\ntraces a single story through several millennia and dozens of different\ncultures, empires, and societies — the story of how man emerged\nfrom tribal structures into a modern state. Fukuyama talks with\nNRO’s Matthew Shaffer, about the book and how his thinking about\nworld order and America’s place in it has changed over the last 20\nyears.\n\nMATTHEW SHAFFER: Origins is a historical work, as opposed to\nprevious works, such as The End of History, and Our Posthuman\nFuture, which were more theoretical. What, for you, is the\nprescriptive value of history?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031898",
