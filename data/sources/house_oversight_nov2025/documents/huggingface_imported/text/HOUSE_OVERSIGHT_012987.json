In a vision processing\ncontext, for example, it allows for powerful unsupervised classification. If shown a variety o\nreal-world scenes, it will automatically form internal structures corresponding to the various\nnatural categories of objects shown in the scenes, such as trees, chairs, people, etc.; and also\nthe various natural categories of events it sees, such as reaching, pointing, falling. And, as wil\nbe discussed below, it can use feedback from DeSTIN’s action and critic networks to further\nshape its internal world-representation based on reinforcement signals.\n\nBenefits of DeSTIN for Perception Processing\n\nDeSTIN’s perceptual network offers multiple key attributes that render it more powerful than\nother deep machine learning approaches to sensory data processing:\n\n1. The belief space that is formed across the layers of the perceptual network inherently\ncaptures both spatial and temporal regularities in the data. Given that many applications\nrequire that temporal information be discovered for robust inference, this is a key advantage\nover existing schemes.\n\n2. Spatiotemporal regularities in the observations are captured in a coherent manner (rather\nthan being represented via two separate mechanisms)\n\n3. All processing is both top-down and bottom-up, and both hierarchical and heterarchical,\nbased on nonlinear feedback connections directing activity and modulating learning in mul-\ntiple directions through DeSTIN’s cortical circuits\n\n4, Support for multi-modal fusing is intrinsic within the framework, yielding a powerful state\ninference system for real-world, partially-observable settings.\n\n5. Each node is identical, which makes it easy to map the design to massively parallel platforms,\nsuch as graphics processing units.\n\nPoints 2-4 in the above list describe how DeSTIN’s perceptual network displays its own\n“cognitive synergy” in a way that fits naturally into the overall synergetic dynamics of the overall\nCogPrime architecture. Using this cognitive synergy, DeSTIN’s perceptual network addresses\na key aspect of general intelligence: the ability to robustly infer the state of the world, with\nwhich the system interacts, in an accurate and timely manner.\n\n4.3.1.3 DeSTIN for Action and Control\n\nDeSTIN’s perceptual network performs unsupervised world-modeling, which is a critical aspect\nof intelligence but of course is not the whole story. DeSTIN’s action network, coupled with the\nperceptual network, orchestrates actuator commands into complex movements, but also carries\nout other functions that are more cognitive in nature.\n\nFor instance, people learn to distinguish between cups and bowls in part via hearing other\npeople describe some objects as cups and others as bowls. To emulate this kind of learning,\nDeSTIN’s critic network provides positive or negative reinforcement signals based on whether\nthe action network has correctly identified a given object as a cup or a bowl, and this signal\nthen impacts the nodes in the action network. The critic network takes a simple external “degree\nof success or failure” signal and turns it into multiple reinforcement signals to be fed into the\nmultiple layers of the action network. The result is that the action network self-organizes so\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012987",
