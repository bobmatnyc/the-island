  "text": "“Creativity is allowing yourself to\nmake mistakes. Art is knowing\nwhich ones to keep.”\n\nScott Adams\n\n“Invention is 1% inspiration and\n99% perspiration.”\nThomas Edison\n\n“Creativity is just connecting\nthings. When you ask creative\npeople how they did something,\nthey feel a little guilty because\nthey didn't really do it, they\njust saw something. It seemed\nobvious to them after a while.\nThats because they were able to\nconnect experiences they've had\nand synthesize new things.”\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015986",
