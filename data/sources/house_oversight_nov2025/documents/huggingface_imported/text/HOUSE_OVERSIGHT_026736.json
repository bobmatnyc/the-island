There could be unintended side- effects.\nMoreover, the warming would return with a vengeance if the countermeasures were\never discontinued; and other consequences of rising CO2 (especially the deleterious\neffects of ocean acidification) would be unchecked.\n\nGeoengineering would be a political nightmare: not all nations would want to adjust\nthe thermostat the same way. Very elaborate climatic modelling would be needed in\norder to calculate the regional impacts of an artificial intervention. (The only\nbeneficiaries would be lawyers. They’d have a bonanza if nations could litigate over\nbad weather!).\n\nIt may be prudent to explore geoengineering techniques enough to clarify which\noptions make sense, and perhaps damp down undue optimism about a technical\n‘quick fix' of our climate.\n\nEARTH\n\n| think we should be evangelists for new technologies - without them the world can’t\nprovide food, and sustainable energy, for an expanding .and more demanding\npopulation. But we need wisely-directed technology - advanced renewables are wise\n\ngoals, geoengineering techniqoes probably aren't.\n\nBut what about the other technologies that pervade our lives?
