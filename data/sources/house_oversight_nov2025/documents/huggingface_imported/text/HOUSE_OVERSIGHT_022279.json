The Board’s Section 6 Rulemaking\nAuthority\n\nNumerous comments dispute the\nBoard’s statutory authority to enact the\nproposed rule. Many note the fact that\nthe Board’s rulemaking is constrained\nby Congressional intent as evidenced in\nits enabling statute. For instance, the\nAmerican Trucking Association quotes a\nNinth Circuit case explaining that\nSection 6 ‘‘does not authorize the Board\nto promulgate rules and regulations\nwhich have the effect of enlarging its\nauthority beyond the scope intended by\nCongress,’ 11 and similarly, the Motor &\nEquipment Manufacturers Association\nasserts, “A regulation cannot stand if it\nis contrary to the statute.’’12 The Board\nagrees that it may not exercise its\nrulemaking authority in a way contrary\nto that intended by Congress, but for the\nreasons discussed below it also does not\nbelieve that it has done so in this rule.\n\nSeveral comments assert that because\nNLRA Section 6 is written in general,\nrather than specific, terms, the Board is\nnot empowered to enact the proposed\nrule. For example, Associated Builders\nand Contractors argues that “the lack of\nexpress statutory language under\nSection 6 of the NLRA to require the\nposting of a notice of any kind ‘is a\nstrong indicator, if not dispositive, that\nthe Board lacks the authority to impose\nsuch a requirement * * *.’’?18 And the\nHeritage Foundation likewise argues\nthat the Board’s reliance upon its\ngeneral Section 6 rulemaking authority\ndoes not suffice to meet the\nAdministrative Procedure Act’s\nrequirement that the NPRM must\n\n11 Gen. Eng’g, Inc. v. NLRB, 341 F.2d 367, 374\n(1965).\n\n12 Citing United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642,\n673 (1997). However, the Supreme Court actually\nheld there that an agency’s interpretation of its\nenabling statute must be given ‘‘controlling weight\nunless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly\ncontrary to the statute.” (quoting Chevron U.S.A.\nInc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n844 (1984)). There, the Court upheld the rule and\nfound it was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly\ncontrary to the statute.\n\n13 Quoting Member Hayes’ dissent, 75 FR 80415.\n\n“reference the legal authority under\nwhich the rule is proposed.” 14\n\nThe Board believes that these\ncomments are in error because the\ncourts’ construction of other statutes’\ngeneral rulemaking authority, as well as\nSection 6 in particular, fully support its\nreading of this statutory provision. In\nfact, earlier this year, the Supreme Court\nissued a decision in Mayo Foundation\nfor Medical Education and Research v.\nUnited States 1° (discussed more fully\nbelow), unanimously reaffirming the\nprinciple that a general grant of\nrulemaking authority fully suffices to\nconfer legislative (or binding)\nrulemaking authority upon an agency.\n\nEven prior to Mayo, a long line of both\nnon-NLRA and NLRA cases supported\nreading Section 6 in the manner\nsuggested by the Board. Over forty years\nago, in Thorpe v. Housing Authority,'®\nthe Supreme Court found that the\nexpansive grant of rulemaking authority\nin Section 8 of the Housing Act was\nsufficient to grant legislative rulemaking\npower to the Department of Housing\nand Urban Development. The Court\nfurther noted that “[s]uch broad rule-\nmaking powers have been granted to\nnumerous other federal administrative\nbodies in substantially the same\nlanguage.’ 17 A few years later, in\nMourning v. Family Publication\nServices,1® the Court reaffirmed its\nstance in Thorpe:\n\nWhere the empowering provision of a\nstatute states simply that the agency may\n‘make * * * such rules and regulations as\nmay be necessary to carry out the provisions\nof this Act,’ we have held that the validity\nof a regulation promulgated thereunder will\nbe sustained so long as it is ‘reasonably\nrelated to the purposes of the enabling\nlegislation.’ 19\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s lead,\nkey circuit decisions then extended the\n\n14 See 5 USC 553(b)(2). For this conclusion, the\nHeritage Foundation cites Global Van Lines, Inc., v.\nICC, 714 F.2d 1290, 1297-98 (5th Cir. 1983). But\nGlobal Van Lines did not find that a general\nstatement of authority can never meet the APA’s\nrequirements to specify the legal authority for the\nrule. Instead, the Fifth Circuit held that that portion\nof the APA is violated when an agency chooses to\nrely on additional statutory provisions in support\nof its rule for the first time on appeal, and those\ngrounds do not appear elsewhere in the\nadministrative record. See id. at 1298-99. Here, in\ncontrast, the grounds for the Board’s rule are clearly\nlaid out in subsection B, Statutory Authority,\nbelow.\n\n145131 S.Ct. 704, 713-14 (2011).\n\n16 393 U.S. 268 (1969).\n\n17 Id, at 277 n. 28 (citations omitted). The\nrulemaking grant there at issue provided that HUD\nmay, “from time to time * * * make, amend, and\nrescind such rules and regulations as may be\nnecessary to carry out the provisions of this Act,”\nid. at 277, quite similar to Section 6 of the NLRA.\n\n18 411 U.S. 356 (1973).\n\n19 Id. at 369 (quoting Thorpe, 393 U.S. at 280-81).\n\nnotion that broad grants of rulemaking\nauthority conveyed legislative\nrulemaking power.?° Although the\nBoard had historically chosen to make\npolicy by adjudications, the Supreme\nCourt, consistent with the non-NLRA\ncase law, used a pair of Board\nenforcement cases to unanimously\nemphasize the existence of the Board’s\nlegislative rulemaking authority, NLRB\nv. Wyman-Gordon Co.2! and NLEB v.\nBell Aerospace.22\n\nIn 1991, after the Board enacted a rule\ninvolving health care units, the\nSupreme Court unanimously upheld\nthat rule in American Hospital\nAssociation v. NLRB.?* The Supreme\nCourt found that that the general grant\nof rulemaking authority contained in\nSection 6 of the Act “‘was\nunquestionably sufficient to authorize\nthe rule at issue in this case unless\nlimited by some other provision in the\nAct.” 24 As in AHA, there is no such\nlimitation here on the Board’s authority\nto enact the proposed Rule, as explained\nfurther below. As Senator Tom Harkin\nand Representative George Miller 25\nemphasized in their comment, the\nSupreme Court in AHA examined “the\nstructure and the policy of the NLRA,”\nin order to conclude:\n\nAs a matter of statutory drafting, if\nCongress had intended to curtail in a\nparticular area the broad rulemaking\nauthority granted in § 6, we would have\nexpected it to do so in language expressly\ndescribing an exception from that section or\nat least referring specifically to the section.?°\n\nThus, the Court could not have been\nclearer that unless the Board is\n“expressly” limited in some manner,\nSection 6 empowers the Board to make\n“such rules and regulations as may be\nnecessary to carry out the provisions of\nthis Act.” This point was underscored\n\n20 Nat’! Ass’n. of Pharm. Mfrs. v. FTC, 637 F.2d\n877, 880 (2d Cir. 1981) (‘this generous construction\nof agency rulemaking authority has become firmly\nentrenched”); Nat’! Petroleum Refiners Ass’n v.\nFTC, 482 F.2d 672, 686 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (“plain,\nexpansive language” of the rulemaking grant at\nissue, together with the “‘broad, undisputed\npolicies’ meant to be furthered by Congress’s\nenactment of the Federal Trade Commission Act of\n1914, sufficed to grant the FTC substantive\nrulemaking authority).\n\n21394 U.S. 759, 764 (1969) (plurality opinion of\nFortas, J., joined by Warren, C.J., Stewart, J., and\nWhite, J.), 770 (Black, J., Marshall, J., and Brennan,\nJ). 777, 779 (Douglas, J.), 783 n. 2 (Harlan, J.).\n\n22.416 U.S. 267, 295 (1974) (majority opinion of\nPowell, J., and dissenting opinion of White, J.
