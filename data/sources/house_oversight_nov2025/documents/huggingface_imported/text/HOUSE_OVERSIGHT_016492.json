  "text": "570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. Specifically, the “evidence . . . established that [Epstein] committed\nmultiple offenses against a series of underage girls,” who “were brought to [Epstein’s] home to\nprovide ‘massages’ that led to very serious sex crimes.” Jd. at 570-71, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240.\n\n. Although the Manhattan District Attorney’s briefing remains under seal, the Decision\nindicates that “the People [took] a different position on appeal from the position they took before\nthe hearing court.” Jd. at 571, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 241. This Court did not, however, unseal any of\nthe appeal briefs or provide a detailed summary of the parties’ respective arguments. The public\nand the press are thus left in the dark as to what exactly the District Attorney’s Office and\nEpstein wrote in their respective appeal briefs. It appears that the District Attorney’s Office may\nhave taken the position that ADA Gaffney had “mistakenly conceded [before the lower court]\nthat the conduct for which defendant was not indicted should not be considered, and that\ndefendant should be adjudicated a level one offender.” /d. at 572, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 241. The\nDecision also states that this Court rejected Epstein’s argument that the District Attorney “should\nbe estopped” from changing position on appeal and also rejected Epstein’s “remaining claims” as\nbeing “improperly raised for the first time on appeal.” Jd. The public has the right to know more\nthan these sketchy details, however, particularly when the arguments advanced by the parties on\nappeal clearly discuss the decision taken by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to abruptly\nchange its earlier position that Epstein was deserving of lenient treatment.\n\nC. Media Interest in New York and Florida Prosecutors’ Lenient Handling of Epstein’s\nCase\n\nThe handling of Epstein’s prosecution in Florida and the subsequent sex offender\nregistration proceeding against in him New York have both been the subject of legitimate public\ninterest and intense controversy. In the Florida proceedings, the prosecutors were criticized for\n\nallowing Epstein to enter into a seemingly favorable plea deal.
