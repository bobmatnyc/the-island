For another, the NPT incorporates the utopian vision of global\nzero and even sails beyond it, calling for “general and complete\ndisarmament that liquidates, in particular, nuclear weapons.” Since\nalmost no governments anywhere in the world actually believe in\n“general and complete disarmament,” the effect of its inclusion in the\nNPT simply robs that treaty of any gravity.\n\nIt is widely accepted among those who think the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty is the key to containing the spread of nuclear weapons that\ncontrol of the international fuel cycle must be achieved by an\ninternational consensus and administered and enforced by the UN or\ncomparable body. But suppose a much smaller group of nations—a\ncoalition of the willing, perhaps—sought to control the nuclear fuel\ncycle, or at least deal with would-be proliferators in a firm, timely\nand decisive manner: Could such a coalition achieve legitimacy in\nlight of the universalist conceit of the NPT? Would it even\ncontemplate action outside the treaty?\n\nBut what made the 2007 Wall Street Journal article so important was\nnot its prescription for obviously necessary measures such as\nensuring controls for nuclear fuel. It was that its appearance\nreinforced a growing utopianism that has flowered into a movement\nfor “a world free of nuclear weapons,” a movement whose\nmomentum is reminiscent of the 1980s movement for a “nuclear\nfreeze” —a Soviet-manipulated protest aimed at halting Ronald\nReagan’s modernization of the American nuclear deterrent. Shultz,\nKissinger, Perry, and Nunn should have foreseen that their statement\nwould be seized upon by irresponsible actors. All four, after all,\nopposed the nuclear freeze movement of the 1980s.\n\nThe goal of a nuclear-free world was made even more emphatic in a\nsecond article, also in the Wall Street Journal, that the authors wrote\na year after the first one (January 15, 2008): “Progress must be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023496",
