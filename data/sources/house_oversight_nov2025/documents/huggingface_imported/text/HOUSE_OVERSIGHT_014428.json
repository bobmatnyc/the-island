  "text": "3 risks — reality vs hope, higher yields, politics\n\nThe biggest risk to our view is that actual US fiscal easing turns out to be minimal. But\nwe believe the USD/JPY’s move will be quicker than whatever reality emerges in coming\nmonths. China’s unexpected RMB devaluation or any explicit rhetoric to guide USD\nweakness by the new US administration could eventually trigger significant JPY strength.\nThe other risk is a rapid increase in US long-term yields triggers risk-off trade,\nsupporting Japanese yen. However, we believe a potential correction in US equity is\nunlikely to reverse the medium-term direction of USD/JPY (though it could cause a\nshort-term pullback as our technical analysis suggests) because higher yields and\nUSD/JPY are backed by fundamentals for now —prospect for fiscal easing. Finally, politics\nis a significant concern. The President-elect has previously criticized the Japan-US\nsecurity alliance. A shift away from the Japan-US security alliance could lead to higher\ngeopolitical risk for Japan. It could also lead to more defense spending and expansion of\nJapanese military capability and could lift prospect for fiscal expansion. A combination\nof higher geopolitical risk and defense spending is probably less bearish USD/JPY than\nJapanese equities.\n\nBankof America\nMerrill Lynch Japan Macro Watch | 14 November 2016 5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014428",
