  "text": "Price objective basis & risk\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL / GOOG)\n\nOur price objective is $1025/$1025, representing 17x our core 2018 Google non-GAAP\nEPS estimate (excluding non-Google losses), plus $118/share in cash, or 21x core\nGoogle GAAP EPS plus cash. Alphabet has traded at 12-24x forward P/E over the last\nfive years and we think our 17x multiple is reasonable given shareholder friendly actions\nthat include the non-core revenue and operating loss disclosures, and stock buybacks.\n\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) Search revenue growth decelerates faster than\nanticipated due to market maturity, 2) mobile transition drives negative search behavior\nchanges, 3) revenue growth pressure from competitor initiatives, 4) margins disappoint\ndue to revenue mix and investment initiatives, and 5) negative regulatory changes,\nincluding EU antitrust. The stock has been subject to heavy volatility in the past based\non revenue growth and margin trends and this volatility could increase if economic\nconditions deteriorate.\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN)\n\nOur PO of $1,100 is based on our SOP that values AWS at $127bn or $259 per share\nand the retail business at $413bn or $841 per share. Our 5.5x AWS multiple is a modest\npremium to the software/SaaS comp group at 5.0x on 2018 sales, and 0.9x multiple is a\npremium to a retail general merchandise comp group at 0.7x. We think the premiums are\nwarranted given share gains and superior growth. Our $1,100 price objective implies\n2.8x 2018E Price/Sales, a multiple above the high end of Amazon's historical range of\n1.0-2.5x. We argue the historical P/S multiple should increase given positive 3rd party\nsales (3P) that is reported on a net basis, a higher AWS revenue contribution, and record\ngross profit margins.\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are a consumer spending slowdown, rich P/E\nmultiple, margin or growth pressure from the digitization of media, more aggressive\noffline competition, hardware strategy, AWS investments and/or price cuts, Prime\nInstant Video content costs, and decelerating growth. The stock has been subject to\nheavy volatility in the past, based on margin trends, and this volatility could increase due\nto economic uncertainty.\n\nBankrate (RATE)\n\nOur $13 price objective is based on 9x our 2018E EV/EBITDA, a slight discount to the\nonline lead-gen and marketplace peer group average of 11x. We believe it is reasonable\nfor RATE to trade at a slight discount given RATE's recent challenges to both growth\nand margins and its position as a turnaround in the space.\n\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) limited visibility into intra-quarter trends, 2) stock\ndependent on economic outlook, 3) card issuer spending is volatile and the turnaround is\nshort lived, 4) slower growth in personal loans than expected, 5) higher than expected\nmarketing spending to drive traffic to Bankrate sites, resulting in lower margins, 6)\nGoogle changes have a negative impact on marketing margins and EPS, 7) competition\nwith other consumer finance sites, and 8) a large acquisition.\n\nCare.com (CRCM)\n\nOur $9 price objective is based on 1.3x 2018E EV/Sales or 10x 2018E EV/EBITDA, in line\nwith small cap ecommerce and subscription peers. Care.com has category leadership\nand a large TAM, but we do not believe 7% 2-yr expected revenue growth warrants a\npremium to peers. At the same time, we believe that the Google Capital investment\ncould provide some downside support on take-out potential.\n\nDownside risks to our PO are 1) need to add more customers each year to grow given\nhigh churn, 2) competition from SitterCity and Homestead, and 3) new care offerings\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 53\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014939",
