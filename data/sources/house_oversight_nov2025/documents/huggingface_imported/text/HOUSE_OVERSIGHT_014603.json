As seen in Exhibit\n85, Moody’s composite Liquidity Stress Index\n(LSI) began to deteriorate in advance of previous\ndefault cycles. Third, the commodity sectors of the\nhigh yield universe—which collectively generated\na staggering 85% of last year’s defaults—are\nrecovering along with oil prices. Keep in mind\nthat the par-weighted default rate excluding\nthese sectors was just 0.5% last year, a fraction\nof the 3.2% long-run average.” Finally, our\ndefault model—which incorporates the leading\ncharacteristics of the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan\nOfficer Opinion Survey and the percentage of\ndistressed bonds—is projecting 2-3% par-weighted\ndefaults in the year ahead.\n\nOther factors corroborate our low-default view.\nAs seen in Exhibit 86, there is very little refinancing\n\nWe think the strong fundamentals\n\nunderpinning US corporate high yield\n\nstill warrant an overweight, though\n\nreturns are almost certain to be more\n\nmodest going forward.\n\nrisk, given that less than 10% of existing debt\nmatures in the next two years. Of equal importance,\ninterest coverage stands near all-time highs today,\nin stark contrast to the period preceding the\nfinancial crisis (see Exhibit 87). This point is further\nillustrated by Exhibit 88, which shows that today’s\nhigh yield universe is much healthier than the pre-\ncrisis cohort, regardless of measure. Keep in mind\nthat low-rated CCC bonds represented just 8% of\nhigh yield issuance last year, a 14-year low.\"\n\nWe also note that high yield may be a better\ninterest rate hedge than many investors realize.\nConsider that during unexpected interest rate\nbackups in the past, high yield has generated a\npositive return 69% of the time and a return that\nexceeded investment grade fixed income 85%\nof the time (see Exhibit 89). This last point is\nimportant, as our high yield overweight is funded\nout of investment grade fixed income.\nHigh yield’s hedging qualities were\napparent last year, as the asset class\nappreciated nearly 7% in the second\nhalf of the year despite an increase in\nTreasury yields of more than 100 basis\npoints. Although we assume that any\nfurther increase in 10-year Treasury\nrates this year will not be offset by high\nyield spreads, this historical relationship\n\nsuggests that may be overly conservative.\n\n70 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014603",
