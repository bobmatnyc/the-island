  "text": "Meantime, since gays and lesbians have waited so long for basic\nfairness, they might as well just wait for the next election. If you win, then\nwould you kindly do immediately what you believe is right, constitutionally\nand in your heart, and end this injustice? The ultimate irony is that gays in\nthe military are fighting, being maimed and dying unnecessarily,\nsupposedly to protect the freedom their own country is denying them.\n\nSincerely,\nPaul Krassner\nPostscript:\n\n| sent a copy of the letter to some folks that day. Among the\nresponses, | received a message from a mother: “I am trying to explain\nthis to my twelve-year-old son, who wants to know why, if men and\nwomen don’ t share barracks in the military, why gay men and hetero\nmen should share barracks, but then follows with ‘They should all sleep in\nthe same place.’ \"\n\nAnd that evening | received this email from a seasoned journalist: “I\nknow it's late, but | cannot wait to ask if this letter is a spoof, or you've\nactually sent it to Obama. If it's a spoof and you've not sent it to him,\nwould you like to? I've got his fax number and he's got a great sense of\n\nhumor. May | have your permission to send this to him?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015328",
