  "text": "Biggest issues/risks:\ne Low reviews scores on Iron Fist effecting fan churn and causing some to question\nNetflix’s ability to continue creating hit series\n\n« Marketing spend in 1Q to drive subscriber growth\ne Lower than expected contribution margins as Netflix invests in content.\n\n¢ Content spending impact on FCF\n\nTop 1Q data points: Traffic gains on PC\n\nIn the U.S., comScore reported quarter to date (Jan. and Feb.) average unique desktop\nvisitors up down 2% y/y to 40.5 million compared to 4Q up 22% y/y or 47 million, while\nmobile unique users were flat y/y at 29.4mn users vs. up 19% y/y in 4Q. We note recent\ncomScore changes heavily impacted the y/y comparable data for several companies\nincluding Netflix, in addition Comscore Data is PC only which is likely less relevant given\nthat a large portion of Netflix viewing is through connected TVs/devices.\n\nEstimates vs. Consensus: In-line on revenue, slightly below on EPS\n\nOur 1Q rev/GAAP EPS estimates of $2.71bn/$0.39 are above the Street’s estimates of\n$2.64bn/S0.37. We estimate total domestic subs of 51.1 million, domestic DVD subs of\n4 million, and international streaming subs of 48.3 million. Netflix a solid line up of\npopular content in 2Q, especially May where it has Sense& Season 2, Unbreakable\nKimmy Schmidt Season 3, War Machine (Movie), House of Cards Season 5 in May, and a\nremake of Anne of Green Gables and Orange is the New Black in June which will likely\nhelp U.S. domestic subscriber total stay positive in 2Q. In addition, we expect lower y/y\nchurn rates to potentially help subscriber growth.\n\nTable 18: Netflix estimate summary\n\n1017 2017 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $2,710 $2,854 $11,627 $13,937\nGrowth Y/Y% 38% 35% 32% 20%\nStreet $2,644 $2,760 $11,221 $13,448\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. $331 $306 $1,218 $1,758\nStreet $308 $245 $1,053 $1,710\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nGAAP EPS\nBofAML est. $0.39 $0.30 $1.19 $2.04\nStreet $0.37 $0.23 $1.09 $1.98\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, company report\n\nBankof America 2 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 929\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014915",
