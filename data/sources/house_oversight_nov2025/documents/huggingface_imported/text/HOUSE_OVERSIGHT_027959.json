  "text": "Chapter Eight\n\nIt was the same jumble of buildings in the same corner of the base where I’d\nreported a decade earlier, as a 19-year-old fresh from fironut, when the sayeret\nwas still a gleam in Avraham Arman’s eye. Now, I was about to become the first\nof his successors to have been chosen from within the unit itself. As I called\ntogether the officers that first morning, I couldn’t be sure whether I would make\na success of my two years in command. But I did know what I hoped that I, and\nwe, would accomplish: to complete Avraham’s vision. To forge a true special-\nforces unit, at a time when the threats facing Israel seemed increasingly to\ndemand one.\n\nAvraham’s initial hopes and expectations for the unit had been more than\nmet. Sayeret Matkal had played the key role in erasing the traumas of Uri Ilan\nand Rotem, and restoring the morale and effectiveness of Israeli military\nintelligence. Time and again, operations which we said we could do — dismissed\nas too dangerous, or impossible, by others — proved achievable. Yet as I now\ntold the team leaders and our other officers, this was no longer enough.\n\nOur intelligence operations still mattered. In fact, we would have to “push\nfurther” across Arab borders, deeper into enemy communications systems. Our\nintercepts had given Israel an important edge in the Six-Day War. I assumed —\nthough naively, it would turn out — that they would be put to use in any future\nwar. But if the sayeret was to retain its unique role, we had to become a fighting\nforce as well. One reason, I didn’t even have to mention: we all remembered our\nfrustration in 1967, when we’d been little more than bit players in the most\nimportant conflict since the establishment of the state. But for me, the main\nargument for change was what had happened since the 1967 war: the fact that\nIsrael was facing a new range of security challenges which other army units,\ntrained to engage and defeat enemy troops on the battlefield, were not equipped\nto meet.\n\nIn the War of Attrition, we might not have lost a single inch of territory. But\nwe had lost tanks and planes. Israeli soldiers and pilots were being held prisoner\nin Egypt and Syria. Arafat’s Fatah and the other armed Palestinian groups might\nnot present a conventional threat. Yet while I’d been with my tank company in\nthe Sinai, they were fighting a full-scale civil war against King Hussein’s army\nin Jordan. The catalyst: a multiple hijacking in September 1970, a sign that they\nwere turning to non-conventional warfare, and to acts of terror.\n\n111\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027959",
