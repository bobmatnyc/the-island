  "text": "“I love Reince,” said the president, with the faintest praise. “Who else would do this\njob?”\n\nAmong the three men with effectively equal rank in the West Wing—Priebus and\nBannon and Kushner—only a shared contempt kept them from ganging up on one another.\n\nIn the early days of Trump’s presidency, the situation seemed clear to everybody: three\nmen were fighting to run the White House, to be the real chief of staff and power behind\nthe Trump throne. And of course there was Trump himself, who didn’t want to relinquish\npower to anyone.\n\nIn these crosshairs was thirty-two-year-old Katie Walsh.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nWalsh, the White House deputy chief of staff, represented, at least to herself, a certain\nRepublican ideal: clean, brisk, orderly, efficient. A righteous bureaucrat, pretty but with a\npermanently grim expression, Walsh was a fine example of the many political\nprofessionals in whom competence and organizational skills transcend ideology. (To wit:\n“T would much rather be part of an organization that has a clear chain of command that I\ndisagree with than a chaotic organization that might seem to better reflect my views.’’)\nWalsh was an inside-the-Beltway figure—a swamp creature. Her expertise was\nprioritizing Beltway goals, coordinating Beltway personnel, marshaling Beltway\nresources. A head-down-get-things-done kind of person was how she saw herself. And no\nnonsense.\n\n“Any time someone goes into a meeting with the president there are like sixty-five\nthings that have to happen first,” she enumerated. “What cabinet secretary has to be\nalerted about what person is going in there; what people on the Hill should be consulted;\nthe president needs a policy briefing, so who’s owning the brief and getting it to\nappropriate staff members, oh and by the way you have to vet the guy... . Then you have\nto give it to comms and figure out if it’s a national story, a regional story and are we doing\nop-eds, going on national TV ... and that’s before you get to political affairs or public\nliaison... . And for anybody who meets with the president, it has to be explained why\nother people are not meeting with him, or else they’ll go out there and shit all over the last\nperson who was in... .”\n\nWalsh was what politics is supposed to be—or what it has been. A business supported\nby, tended to, and, indeed, ennobled, by a professional political class. Politics, evident in\nthe sameness and particular joylessness of Washington dress, a determined anti-fashion\nstatement, is about procedure and temperament. Flash passes. No flash stays in the game.\n\nFrom an all-girl Catholic school in St. Louis (still wearing a diamond cross around her\nneck) and volunteer work on local political campaigns, Walsh went to George Washington\nUniversity—D.C. area colleges being among the most reliable feeders of swamp talent\n(government is not really an Ivy League profession).
