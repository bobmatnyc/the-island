Despite the recent strong performance,\nthe market is still inexpensive relative to other regions and\nindices. MSCI Korea's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.1x and\nprice-to-earnings (P/E) (12 month forward) ratio of 9.4x are\n30% and 31% lower than MSCI Asia ex. Japan Index, respectively\nas shown in CHART 4.\n\nThree Korean industry groups or sectors currently offer\ncompelling relative valuations when contrasted against other\ngeographies. The Korean Automobiles and Components\nindustry group currently trades at a P/B ratio of 1.0x which\ncompares favorably to Japan’s P/B ratio of 1.4x. When\ncomparing the automobile original equipment manufacturers\n(OEM), Korean OEMs trade at a P/B ratio near 0.5x book,\nwhich is a steep discount to their Japanese rivals. The Korean\nAutomobiles and Components industry group appears\nundervalued when you also consider the fact that the five-year\naverage return on equity (ROE) was 14.4% versus 11.8% for the\nJapanese group.\n\nUtilities is another sector where the valuation disparity is stark.\nKorea's largest electricity producer currently trades at a P/B\nratio of 0.4x despite three stellar years of strong operating\nmargin and prudent capital discipline. By comparison, the\n\nMmmm MSCI ASIA EX. JAPAN\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nDIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nJapanese utility sector currently trades at P/B ratio of 1.0x with\nthe Tokyo regional electricity producer trading at a P/B ratio of\n0.6x despite ¥10 trillion of possible unreserved liabilities\nstemming from a 2011 nuclear disaster. Finally, Korean banks\nare currently trading at a P/B ratio of 0.8x, which compares\nfavorably to Japan's 1.0x and Italy’s 0.9x. It is estimated that the\nloan portfolios of the Korean banks have improved in recent\nyears as evidenced by improving ROE. In the most recent fiscal\nyear, Korean banks generated ROE of 7.7%, outperforming\nJapan's 7.5% and Italy’s 6.7%.\n\nThese discrepancies in valuation have just started to close with\nthe new president and the formation of his cabinet, but Korean\nmarket multiples have the potential to converge closer to global\nlevels with a successful execution of corporate reform. We are\nnot advocating that the new government implement heavy-\nhanded methods to incite change among the chaebols. Instead,\nwe believe that working with the chaebols in enhancing\ngovernance, minimizing cross holdings, creating board\nindependence and minority shareholder protection, would be\nwell received by global investors and mostly rewarding to\nchaebol valuations.
