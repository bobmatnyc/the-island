  "text": "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians\n\ngive the authorities wide discretion in applying\nthem to regime opponents. Such measures are\ntypically paired with a court system that uses law\nmerely to justify political instructions from the ex-\necutive branch, making a mockery of due process\nand international conceptions of the rule of law.\n\n4. History revised: A number of countries have un-\ndertaken a refashioning of history to buttress the\nlegitimacy and aims of the current government.\nHistorians and journalists are forbidden to cross\ncertain redlines set by the authorities. In China,\nthe state has prevented the publication of full,\naccurate, or critical accounts of the Great Leap\nForward, the Cultural Revolution, or the Mao Ze-\ndong era in general. In Russia, Joseph Stalin has\nbeen rehabilitated. He is now officially portrayed\nas a strong if mildly flawed leader rather than as\nthe man responsible for the deaths of millions of\nhis own people. In Turkey, Erdogan has decreed\nthat high school students should study the de-\nfunct Ottoman language, challenging a nearly\ncentury-old reform linked to Mustafa Kemal\nAtatiirk, modern Turkey's founder.*\n\n5. Democracy redefined: It is a testament to the\npower of the democratic idea that authoritarian\nleaders around the globe have claimed the man-\ntle of democracy for forms of government that\namount to legalized repression. Even as they\nheap disdain on the liberal order, they have often\ninsisted on the validity of their own systems\nas types of democratic rule. They even devise\nterms to describe their special variant, such as\n“sovereign democracy,” “revolutionary democra-\ncy,\" or “illiberal democracy.\"\n\n6. Return of the leader for life: Among the changes\ninvariably instituted by modern authoritarians is\nthe de facto or de jure removal of constitution-\nal limits on presidential terms. Preventing the\nconcentration of power in a single leader is a\nfundamental goal of democratic governance, but\nauthoritarian propaganda has presented term\nlimits as artificial constraints, associated them\nwith foreign origins, and claimed that they do\nnot suit every country’s unique historical, cultur-\nal, or security conditions.\n\nWhile these ideas may not amount to a coherent\n\nor complete ideology, they do form the basis for an\nimpressive degree of collaboration and alliance-build-\ning that has brought together modern authoritarian\n\nregimes with significantly different economic systems,\nofficial creeds, and sources of political legitimacy.\n\nA loose-knit league of authoritarians works to protect\nmutual interests at the United Nations and other inter-\nnational forums, subverting global human rights stan-\ndards and blocking precedent-setting actions against\nfellow despots. With the formation of the Shanghai\nCooperation Organization, Russia, China, and a number\nof Central Asian governments have come together to\ndiscuss common regime-security strategies.>\n\nMore disturbingly, modern authoritarians collaborate\nto prop up some of the world’s most reprehensible\nregimes, apparently reasoning that the toppling of\none dictator thins the herd, inspires imitation, and\nendangers them all. This is most visible in Syria, where\nRussia, China, Iran, and Venezuela at various times\nhave offered diplomatic support, loans, fuel, or direct\nmilitary aid to the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\n\nDashed hopes\n\nDemocracy recorded unprecedented gains during the\n20th century's last decades. In 1975, Freedom House\nfound that just 25 percent of the world’s sovereign\nstates qualified for the Free category; by 2000, the\nshare of countries rated as Free had reached 45\npercent.\n\nThe numbers told an optimistic story, and a series of\naccelerating social trends suggested that the recent\nimprovements would hold firm and expand as the new\nmillennium dawned.\n\nThere was, to begin with, a strong identification of free\nsocieties with free markets. The degree of economic\nfreedom varied from one society to the next, and\ncorruption was a problem in practically all of the new\ndemocracies. But there was no longer a major bloc of\ncountries that rejected capitalism, and practically ev-\nery country sought to deepen their participation in the\nglobal economic system, as witnessed by the number\nof governments seeking admission to the World Trade\nOrganization. Authorities in the United States and\nelsewhere predicted that as countries came to accept\nthe rules of the game set down by the WTO, they\nwould also be more amenable to accepting the norms\nof liberal democracy, including fair elections, freedom\nof expression, minority rights, and the rule of law.\n\nA second development was the introduction of the in-\nternet and other digital media. In the wake of the col-\nlapse of the Soviet Union, communist governments in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019242",
