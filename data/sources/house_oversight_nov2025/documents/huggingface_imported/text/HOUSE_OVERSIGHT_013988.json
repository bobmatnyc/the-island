Based on the outcomes of steps 1—4, consider testing new part- or full-time vocations.\nFull-time work isn’t bad if it’s what you’d rather be doing. This is where we distinguish “work” from a\n“vocation.”\n\nIf you have created a muse or cut your hours down to next to nothing, consider testing a part-time or\nfull-time vocation: a true calling or dream occupation. This is what I did with this book. I can now tell\npeople [’m a writer rather than giving them the two-hour drug dealer explanation. What did you dream of\nbeing when you were a kid? Perhaps it’s time to sign up for Space Camp or intern as an assistant to a\nmarine biologist.\n\nRecapturing the excitement of childhood isn’t impossible. In fact, it’s required. There are no more\nchains —or excuses—to hold you back.\n\n81.

(I’ve learned that\nnothing is impossible, and that almost nothing is easy ...)\n\n—ARTICOLO 31 (Italian rap group), “Un Urlo”\n\nMsstane are the name of the game in lifestyle design. It requires fighting impulse after impulse\n\nfrom the old world of retirement-based life deferral. Here are the slipups you will make. Don’t get\nfrustrated. It’s all part of the process.\n\n1. Losing sight of dreams and falling into work for work’s sake (W4W) Please reread the\nintroduction and next chapter of this book whenever you feel yourself falling into this trap. Everyone\ndoes it, but many get stuck and never get out.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013988",
