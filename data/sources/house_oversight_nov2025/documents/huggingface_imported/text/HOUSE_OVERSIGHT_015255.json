  "text": "always--move from a human form to a reptilian-type form. There is the\nMayan legend of the iguana. Lizard-like aliens had descended upon the\nMayans. Their pyramids—their advanced astronomical technology\nincluding the sacrifice of virgins—were supposedly inspired by lizard aliens.\nWhen the aliens interbred with the Mayans, they produced a form of life\nthey could inhabit. They fluctuated between a human and iguana\nappearance in chameleon-like abilities, a perfect vehicle for transforming\ninto world leaders.\n\n“Those who have seen a reptilian-type ethereal figure enveloping\nand following around humans and locking into them in those lower two\nchakra points, vortex points, for me, is possession. The more |’ ve\nunderstood this, the more |’ ve realized just how many people, particularly\nthese bloodlines, are actually controlled by these other-dimensional forces,\nand while we appear to be seeing a president or a banking leader in a\nphysical form, the actual point of control is beyond that and\novershadowing it, and on some occasion people see that overshadowing\nentity.”\n\nOne wonders whether such a defense— “The reptile made me do\n\nit!” —will some day be used in a court of law.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015255",
