  "text": "On looking like an ‘asshole’ after commenting on Louis C.K.\n\n“My experience with Louis as a teenager perhaps informs his pathology a bit. But in no way is it\n\nanalogous to crimes, to assaults, he subsequently committed that mirror it, that come from it. I was just\nspeaking about my own experience. And the headline was, ‘He jerked off in front of me and I didn’t\ncare.’ And that’s so cold and insulting and awful to the women who were hurt by his actions. So if you\nclicked on it, they quoted me. But if you didn’t, and nobody does, it just makes me look like an asshole.\nAnd me looking like an asshole is the least of it. It hurt people and there was stuff that I said that I\n\ndon’t think I was articulating the spirit of what I meant.”\n\nCassandra Church/Starburns Audio\n\nOn performing stand-up about being single without sounding\n‘hacky’\n\nRELATED IN ENTERTAINMENT\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031783",
