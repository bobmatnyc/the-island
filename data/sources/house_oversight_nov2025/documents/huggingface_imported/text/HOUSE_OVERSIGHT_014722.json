  "text": "Concerns over stagflation return\n\nOn the surface, this has been an uneventful year for the US rates market so far. At the\nstart of January, the market was pricing two Fed hikes for the year. Six weeks later, the\nmarket is still pricing only two Fed hikes for the year. The yield on the bellwether 10y\nUS Treasuries started the year at 2.44%. Six weeks later, it is at 2.41%, unchanged for\nall practical purposes.\n\nAs usual, the surface view is deceiving. The seeming collapse in volatility belies the\ndramatic changes in the composition and term structure of rates. Since the December\nFOMC meeting, real yields and inflation breakevens have diverged in remarkable fashion.\nYear to date, 5y real yields have declined by 16bp while 5y inflation breakevens have\nrisen by 12bp (Chart 1); the 5s-30s real curve is 1O0bp steeper while the breakeven curve\nis 10bp flatter.\n\nChart 1: 5y real yields and 5y inflation breakevens (%)\n2.5\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0.5\n\n10/1/2016 10/26/2016 += 11/20/2016 += 12/15/2016 + —1/9/2017 2/3/2017\n\n= 5y real yields (%) = ===~=5y infl BE (%)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nThe effect of the divergence between real yields and inflation breakevens has been felt\nacross financial markets. For example, the USD, which trades with real rather than\nnominal yields, has declined in tandem with real yields (Chart 2). In contrast, gold, which\nusually thrives on inflation concerns, has been surging lately.\n\nChart 2: DXY and 5y real yields (%) Chart 3: 5y real yields versus 5y inflation breakevens (%)\n104 0.3 4\n103 0.2\n102 01 3\n101 0 2\n\"0 4 { E1\n2 OT QE3\n98 Oe 0\no7 -0.3\n96 -0.4 “1\n95 -0.5 -2\n94 -0.6 3\n\n10/1/2016 = 11/1/2016 §= 12/1/2016 ~— 1/1/2017 2/1/2017\n\n3/1/2009 3/1/2010\n\n3/1/2011 3/1/2012 3/1/2013\n\na==———DXY (LHS) = ===5y real yields (RHS) a= 5y real yields (%) = ====5y infl BE (%)\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nWe have seen price action like this before. Indeed, it was quite common during the QE\nperiod (Chart 3). However, QE is neither on the horizon nor on investors’ minds right\nnow. So what is really going on? Under normal circumstances, inflation breakevens are a\nreflection of investors’ inflation expectations while real yields a proxy for their growth\n\n2 Cause and Effect | 13 February 2017\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014722",
