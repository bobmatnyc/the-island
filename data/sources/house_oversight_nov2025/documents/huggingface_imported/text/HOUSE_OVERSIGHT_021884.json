Serious federal offenses.\n\nBut then the evidence extended, you know,\nmore broadly than that. The evidence also started to\nshow again if we talk just about flight logs, that\nthe -- that underage girls such as Virginia Roberts were\nbeing flown internationally from, for example, Teterboro\nin New York to locations just to pick one, for example,\nin London, where again sexual abuse was occurring.\n\nAnd so you started to put together this\npattern of criminality that was started in this, you\nknow, I don't know what the right word is here, I don't\nknow -- I don't want to -- you Know, you've heard\ndiscussions of hyperbole and things like that, but we\nhave got this nest of, I won't say snakes, but we have\n\nthis nest of criminals in Florida, but it seems to be\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021884",
