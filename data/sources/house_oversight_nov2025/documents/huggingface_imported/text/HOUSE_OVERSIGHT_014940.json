  "text": "{mobile apps, premium nanny, date night payment services etc.) may not see much\ntraction, 4) lower conversion rates on mobile, 5) mobile conversions with 30% fee to\nApple and Google Play marketplaces could negatively impact margins, and 6)\ninternational expansion may not be successful given different demographics.\n\nUpside risks to our PO are 1} lower marketing spend resulting in higher margins and\nbetter leverage in 2016, 2) revenue upside from cross-selling and word of mouth, 3}\nincrease length of stay for paid subscribers, reducing churn, and 4) traction from new\ncare offerings, Care at Work, and international expansion.\n\neBay (EBAY)\n\nOur $38 price objective is based on 17x our 2018E EPS. Our 17x P/E multiple is slightly\nahead of the retail comp group average of about 16x, reflecting eBay's potential for a\nMarketplace growth acceleration in 2017.\n\nRisks to our price objective are: 1) competition from Amazon and other new\nMarketplaces in the U.S., competition from Amazon, Alibaba and local incumbents in\nInternational markets, and competition from multi-channel retailers that are\naggressively investing in the online channel, 2) vulnerability to future Google algorithm\nchanges, 3) decelerating user growth, resulting in eCommerce market share losses, and\n4) currency risk including FX volatility impact on cross border trade. The stock has been\nsubject to heavy volatility in the past based on GMV growth and market share trends\nand this volatility could increase due to economic uncertainty.\n\nExpedia (EXPE)\n\nOur $146 price objective is based on our sum of the parts (SOP) that assumes 9x 2018E\nEBITDA for the core OTA business (a discount to Priceline at approx. 15x due to slower\norganic growth and higher taxes on earnings), 8x 2018E EBITDA for Egencia (we expect\nsingle digit growth), 60% ownership of Trivago (using our PO), and HomeAway at 15x\n2018 EV/EBITDA.\n\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) economic downturn leading to fewer travel bookings, 2)\ncompetition for European traffic lowering the company's growth or margin opportunity,\n3) hotels favoring lower-cost alternative distribution channels and limiting Expedia's\naccess to inventory, 4) Google and/or TripAdvisor disintermediation, and 5) the negative\nimpact of terrorism and disease on global travel trends.\n\nFacebook (FB)\n\nOur $165 price objective is based on 24x our non-GAAP 2018E EPS and 27x GAAP EPS,\nmultiples equal to about 1x 2018E revenue growth, mostly in-line with its social and\nonline media peers.\n\nRisks are: 1) high valuation that discounts strong growth, 2) changes in user\nengagement impacts optimism on revenue opportunities and compresses the stock\nmultiple, 3) privacy issues or pushback on Facebook's policy changes impact revenue\ngeneration, 4) risks to executing Messenger & WhatsApp monetization, 5) potential for\nhigher investment to negatively impact margins, and 6) a macroeconomic impact on\nadvertising pricing.\n\nFitbit (FIT)\n\nOur $6.50 price objective is based on 0.5x EV/S multiple which is below the device\nmanufacturer peer group at 1.8x, but justified in our view given declining revenue and\nprofitability, FCF burn, market saturation, and limited visibility into the next product cycle.\n\nUpside risks are: 1) international product launches and expansion, 2) higher-than-\nexpected ASPs, 3) new product launches domestically, 4) slower-than-expected OpEx\nramp, 5) software monetization and 6) corporate wellness program growth.\n\n54 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 Bankof America <2\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014940",
