  "text": "June 2014, I was asked to articulate the vision at the first Belt and Road forum in\nUrumai, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. I described five\ncategories: history, culture, trade, mutual development and peaceful development.\n\nThe second forum was in Quanzhou, Southeast China's Fujian province, in February\n2015. It enlarged the vision to include the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road,\nengaging Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and East Africa.\n\nThe third forum was held in Xi'an, Northwest China's Shaanxi province, in\nSeptember 2016, with the theme \"Shared Memory, Common Development\".\n\nTo comprehend Xi's Belt and Road Initiative, one must appreciate globalization,\nwhich is founded on the perennial law of comparative economic advantage but\nwhich is suffering discontent due to its differential impact on workers in Western\ncountries.

Development comes first, China believes;\nnothing good can happen without economic growth.\n\nThe Beijing forum seeks consensus on major cross-regional projects, especially\nnetworks of roads, railways and shipping.\n\nAt the Xi'an forum, I chaired a session (on the media), which was held at precisely\nthe same time as the first debate between US presidential candidates Donald Trump\n\nand Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"One hundred years from today,\" I began, \"when the history of our times is written,\nour forum on the Belt and Road (Initiative) will carry more significance than the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023573",
