  "text": "chapters with Haldeman—this was not ghostwritten material because |\nrewrote what they presented—and Haldeman worked mostly on the Alger\nHiss chapter.\n\nHe was apparently so eager to please, though, that he screwed up\non his research. He had it that the FBI found the old Woodstock\ntypewriter. And the book was published that way. Then the facts came out,\nthe trial records and all, and we had to change it for the paperback edition.\nSo now it reads that the FBI was unab/e to find the typewriter.\n\nThe truth is, Alger Hiss found it himself. But the FBI had p/anted this\nfake Woodstock typewriter. And then the defense presented it in the trial\nas what they assumed was evidence in their favor. So a least Hiss was\nfound guilty of perjury.\n\nThat verdict added immeasurably to my political strength. | had the\ncourage of Alger Hiss’ s conviction and it served as the magic carpet that\ntransported me from the Congress to the Senate to the vice presidency. |\nwould have had the presidency in my pocket if not for Kennedy’ s\nperformance in the Great Debates—but only on television; | fared better\non radio. Kennedy’ s charisma was the variable that none of us had\n\ncounted on.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015100",
