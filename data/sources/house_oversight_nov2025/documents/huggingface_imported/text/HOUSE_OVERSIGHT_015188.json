  "text": "absolutely still while the world passes them by—tran, Iraq, Nicaragua, El\nSalvador—and they get paid for it, just like the Mime. The Democrats are\nlike the Pacer, walking around in circles while the world passes them\nby—lIsrael, Libya, Cuba, Honduras—and they don’ tget paid for it, just like\nthe Pacer.\n\nBut recently the Pacer did something that hurled such a comparison\nright into the metaphor graveyard, along with “That' s like bringing coals\nto Newcastle” (for Newcastle finally ad run out of coal) and “Good as\ngold” (since the government now prints money without the benefit of the\ngold standard). The Pacer had put a cardboard box down on the ground\nand started walking around it. And now people began giving him money.\n\nBy the mere presence of that cardboard box, the Pacer had\ntransformed his personal perversion into a marketable talent. Just like so\nmany of us. And | could no longer feel superior to him. He was not just\nsome nut walking in circles. Now he was earning a living.\n\n| still “do” the Pacer in my act, but with increased respect. “His\njob is no less dignified than anything we do,” | tell the audience. “He\nworks hard all day, and then, just like you and me, he goes home and\nunwinds.” And | proceed to walk around and around in a circle onstage,\n\nonly now in a clockwise direction.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015188",
