  "text": "At least those were the rumors after the war. I asked friends what they were\nhearing. I asked some of the older men on the kibbutz, my father included. All\nof them responded with a slightly different version of events. But I knew what I\nwasn’t hearing. No one of them told me it was a lie. When I asked Yigal, he\naverted my glance, and then changed the subject. I knew it was true, at least\nbroadly.\n\nI realized that, before it happened, Yigal and the others had seen dozens of\nfriends gunned down in an Egyptian ambush in the Mitla Pass. But I didn’t need\na lesson tohar haneshek to know that the killing of captured Egyptian soldiers\nshould not have happened. Or that it was plainly, simply wrong.\n\nWhen Yigal and I made our final trip to Patish in 1959, I knew it would be\npointless to ask him about it. Whatever he said wouldn’t change anything. I still\nrespected his courage and his fighting spirit, and the part he’d played in\ndefending Israel. I appreciated what he’d done for me as I grew up. But what\nmattered now wasn’t what Yigal had done. It was what I would do, and how I\nwould live my life.\n\nEspecially since I, too, was about to begin my army service.\n\n49\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027897",
