Notice how testimonials, credibility indicators, and risk-reversal guarantees are used, as\nwell as how the pricing is put on a separate page so it can be isolated as a testing variable. Use this as a\nreference—it is a simple and effective model that can be copied. Please do not input your credit card\ninformation, as it is just a mock-up for teaching purposes.\n\nFast and Simple Website Creation for Non-Techies (and Techies)\n\n= Weebly ( www.weebly.com )\n\nWeebly, which the BBC labeled “a must,” allowed me to create www.timothyferriss.com in less than two\nhours and have it appear on the front page of Google for “timothy ferriss” searches within 48 hours. It is,\nlike WordPress.com below, designed to be very SEO-friendly (search-engine optimization) without any\nknowledge or action on your part. No HTML or Internet expertise is required.\n\n» WordPress.com ( www.wordpress.com )\n\nI used WordPress.com to set up www.litliberation.org from a coffee shop in Bratislava, Slovakia, when a\nU.S.-based designer flaked out and left me scrambling. It took me less than three hours to learn how to\nuse it and build the site. The site, an experimental educational fundraiser, ended up raising 200%+ more\nthan Stephen Colbert in the same period of time. I also use their free open-sourced version of WordPress\n(www.wordpress.org, which requires separate hosting) to manage everything for my top-1,000 blog at\nwww.fourhourblog.com. This offers greater customization but requires more management and technical\nknow-how.\n\nBoth Weebly and WordPress.com host your site for you, so additional hosting setup isn’t required.\n\nIf you choose to use www.wordpress.org (not.com) for greater customizability, I suggest using a\nhosting service with one-click WordPress installation like www.bluehost.com. The Shopp plug-in\n(http://shopplugin.net/) or Market Theme plug-in (http://www.markettheme.com/) can then be used to\nadd e-commerce capabilities. Shopify.com (discussed later) is another good all-in-one alternative.\n\nCreate Forms in Seconds for Testing Checkout with or Without Payment\n\n= Wufoo ( www.wufoo.com )\n\nWutoo does not offer a full-featured shopping cart, but it provides the cleanest, easiest-to-use forms on\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013914",
