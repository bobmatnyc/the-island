  "text": "up foreign fun faster than having to sign original documents when faxes are unacceptable.\n\n> One month out—\nSpeak to the manager of your local post office and have all mail forwarded to a friend, family member,\n\nor personal assistant,2who will be paid $100-200 per month to e-mail you brief descriptions of all\nnonjunk mail each Monday.\n\nGet all required and recommended immunizations and vaccinations for your target region. Check the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov/travel/). Note that proof of immunizations is\nsometimes required to pass through foreign customs.\n\nSet up a trial account with GoToMyPC or similar remote-access software and take a dry run to ensure\nthat there are no technological glitches. 2\n\nIf resellers (or distributors) still send you checks—the fulfillment house should handle customer\nchecks at this point—do one of three things: give the resellers direct bank deposit information (ideal),\nhave the fulfillment house handle these checks (second choice), or have the resellers pay via PayPal or\nmail checks to one of the people you are trusting with power of attorney (far third). In the last case, give\nthe person with power of attorney deposit slips so he or she can sign or stamp and mail in the checks. It\nis convenient to become a member of a large bank (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual,\nCitibank, etc.) with branches near the person assisting you so that they can drop off the deposits while\nrunning other errands. No need to move all accounts to this bank if you don’t want to; just open a single\nnew account that is used solely for these deposits.\n\n= Two weeks out—\n\nScan all identification, health insurance, and credit/debit cards into a computer from which you can print\nmultiple copies, several to be left with family members and several to be taken with you in separate\nbags. E-mail the scanned file to yourself so that you can access it while abroad if you lose the paper\ncopies.\n\nIf you are an entrepreneur, downgrade your cell phone to the cheapest plan and set up a voicemail\ngreeting that states, “I am currently overseas on business. Please do not leave a voicemail, as I will not\nbe checking it while gone. Please send me an e-mail at__ @__.com if the matter is important. Thank you\nfor your understanding.” Then set up e-mail autoresponders that indicate responses could take up to\nseven days (or whatever you decide for frequency) due to international business travel.\n\nIf you are an employee, consider getting a quad-band or GSM-compatible cell phone so that the boss\ncan contact you. Get a BlackBerry only if your boss will be checking to see if you are working via e-\nmail. Be sure to disable the dead giveaway “Sent from a BlackBerry” signature on outgoing e-mail!\nOther options include using a Skypeln account that forwards to your foreign cell phone (my preference)\nor a Vonage IP box that allows you to receive landline calls anywhere in the world via a phone number\nthat begins with your home area code.\n\nFind an apartment for your ultimate mini-retirement destination or reserve a hostel or hotel at your\nstarting point for three to four days. Reserving an apartment before you arrive is riskier and will be much\nmore expensive than using the latter three to four days to find an apartment. I recommend hostels for the\nstarting point if possible—not for cost considerations but because the staff and fellow travelers are more\nknowledgeable and helpful with relocations.\n\nGet foreign medical evacuation insurance if needed for peace of mind. This tends to be redundant if\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013968",
