Then there's Matt Gaetz\n\nBy ALEX DAUGHERTY\nMcClatchy Washington Bureau\n\nWASHINGTON — Democrats\nare calling for Labor Secretary Alex\nAcosta’s resignation. Republicans\n\nsupport an inter-\nnal investigation\ninto Acosta’ role\nin a controversial\nplea deal for mul-\ntimillionaire sex\nabuser Jeffrey Ep-\nstein in 2008.\n\nBut Florida\nRep. Matt Gaetz,\none of President\nDonald = Trump's\nbiggest defenders\nin Congress, is taking a different ap-\nproach.\n\nIn an interview with the Miami Her-\nald this week, Gaetz said re-examining\nAcosta’s handling of Epstein’ case,\nwhich came under increased scrutiny\nafter the Herald's three-part series Per-\nversion of Justice, sets a “dangerous”\nprecedent for prosecutors, A federal\njudge ruled last week that prosecutors\nrun by Acosta, then the U.S. attorney\nfor South Florida, broke the law when\nthey failed to inform Epstein’s under-\nage victims of the plea agreement.\nThe judge gave federal prosecutors 15\ndays to confer with Epstein’s victims\nand their attorneys to come up with a\nresolution.\n\n“T don't know what I don’t know\nand certainly if there is ever an indi-\ncation of misconduct, that has to be\nthoroughly reviewed, but I think it’s a\ndangerous thing to go back and sec-\nond-guess decisions that prosecutors\n\nMatt Gaetz\n\naw\n\nLabor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nhave to make in real time,” Gaetz said.\n“Tm deeply troubled by Mr. Epstein’s\nactions, I think that he certainly should\nhave faced a far stiffer consequence\nthan he did, but having tried cases I\nknow that it’s hard to go back and sort\nof second-guess the risk analysis that\ngoes into putting witnesses before a\njury and subjecting them to cross-ex-\namination.”\n\nIn fact, the judge in the case, U.S.\nDistrict Judge Kenneth A. Marra, was\ncareful to say he was not questioning\nthe prosecution's authonty to sign a\nnon-prosecution agreement. However,\nthe judge said the U.S. attorney had\nan obligation to consult with Epstein’s\nvictims under the Crime Victims’\nRights Act. Acosta’ deliberate deci-\nsion not to do so — at the insistence\nof Epstein’s legal team — violated that\nlaw, rendering the outcome illegal,\nMarra wrote in a 33-page order.\n\nGaetz’s stance is not shared by other\nSouth Florida lawmakers, including\nRepublicans.\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio, who\n\nintroduced Acosta at his confirmation\nhearing, said he wants to see the results\nofan investigation into the Justice De-\npartment’s internal decision-making\nprocess about Epstein'’s plea deal be-\nfore deciding on Acosta’s future.\n\n“We'd love to have an investigation\nthat looks at all that intemal delibera-\ntion and who knew what about this,\nhow they talk about it, how was this\ndecision ultimately made and what\npapertrail is there about that decision-\nmaking,” Rubio said. “Obviously,\nnewspaper reporting is important but\nso is whatever facts the Justice Depart-\nment has in its possession.”\n\nSen. Rick Scott, Rubio's fellow\nRepublican, had a similar view, along\nwith Miami Republican Rep. Mario\nDiaz-Balart. Both said Acosta doesn't\n\nsi s time, but want\nthe investigation to continue.\n\n“We don't really know all the facts\nyet so it ought tocome out,” Scott said.\n“We need more information.”\n\nSix of the seven Democrats in Con-\ngress from Miami-Dade and Broward\n\nhave called on Acosta to resign, the\nexception being Rep. Donna Shalala.\n\nShalala was part of a group of\nDemocrats who signed on to a letter\nlast week demanding the passage of a\nbill that would allow the Department\nof Justice's Inspector General to re-\nview the conduct of attomeys within\nJustice, a power it does not currently\nhave. Acosta was responsible for ne-\ngotiating Epstein's agreement when\nhe pleaded guilty to two prostitution\ncharges in state court instead of facing\nfederal charges, even though he was\naccused of sexually abusing dozens\nof young girls in his Palm Beach man-\nsion.\n\nFour Democrats, Rep. Debbie\nWasserman Schultz, Rep. Debbie\nMucarsel-Powell, Rep. Lois Frankel\nand Rep. Ted Deutch, signed on to\na letter calling for Trump to demand\nAcosta’s resignation. Rep. Alcee\nHastings also said Acosta should go.\n\n“T would think under the circum-\nstances with such a hot lamp on it,\nhe'dbe better served to resign,” Hast-\nings said. Hastings, a federal judge\nwho was impeached and removed\nfrom office on corruption allega-\ntions before successfully running for\nthe House, said he had never seen a\nplea agreement like Epstein’s during\nhis legal career.\n\nRep. Frederica Wilson went one\nstep further, saying Acosta should\nbe removed from office if he does\nnot resign.\n\n“The ... manner in which he\nhandled the Epstein case clearly\ndemonstrates that he is not the right\nperson to serve as our nation’s la-\nbor secretary,” the Democrat said in\n\na statement. “If he could not stand\nup against Epstein’s white-shoe at-\ntorneys, he clearly is not qualified\nto take on the networks of human\ntraffickers operating in the United\nStates and represent their victims.”\n\nGaetz, the outlier among those\ninterviewed, is important because\nhe is a key Trump ally who fre-\nquently speaks with the president.\nIn his second term in Congress after\nserving in the state House, Gactz\nrepresents the views of the presi-\ndent’s most fervent supporters and\nattracts national attention for his\ndefense of the president's policies\nand rhetoric.\n\nGaetz is currently the subject of\nan inquiry by the Florida Bar after\nposting a tweet that critics said ap-\npeared to be threatening toward for-\nmer Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\nThe tweet, which was later deleted,\nimplied that Cohen had extramarital\nrelations and was posted the night\nbefore the public hearing where Re-\npublicans attempted to shred Cohen's\nry as he detailed his illegal\nactivities on behalf of the president.\n\nGaetz suggested that Acosta’s deci-\nsion to cut a plea deal without the vic-\ntims knowing could have been a move\nto protect them.\n\n“T don't know if this was the case in\nthis matter, but as the former criminal\njustice chairman in Florida, I've seen\nhow a lot of these sexual violence cas-\nes, the fragility of witnesses and the\nwillingness of witnesses can be a fac-\ntor,” Gaetz said. “I'm not saying it was\nhere, I'm just saying that in these types\nof cases it’s something that’s always on\nthe minds of prosecutors.”\n\nEyeing 2020, White House steps up ‘socialism’ attack on Democrats\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nism.”\n\n(AP) — As the White\nHouse gears up for the 2020 campaign, it’s\npressing the case that Democrats are rallying\nbehind what it’s calling the policies of “social-\n\nTrying to portray Democrats as out of step\nwith ordinary Americans, Vice President Mike\nPence said in a speech Friday at the Conser-\nvative Political Action Conference that the\nchoice in the next election is “between free-\n\ndom and socialism, between personal respon-\nsibility and government dependence.”\n\n“The moment America becomes a socialist\ncountry is the moment America ceases to be\nAmerica,” Pence told the crowd of conserva-\n\nlive activists.\n\nPence also took aim at “Medicare-for-all”\nand the Green New Deal, policy proposals\nprominent in the crowded Democratic contest\nfor the presidential nomination.\n\nMattress Sale\nGit) Sut BSmbor\n\nLow Low Low Mattress Prices\nTwin -°129 Queen - 5199\nFull - 5169 King - °259\n\nFurniture Plus - FurniturePlusVi.com © Across from Charlotte Amalie High School © 777-1288\n\nOUR TIRE, BATTERY,\nAND AUTO REPAIR\n\nCENTER IS OPENED!\n* Factory Trained Mechanics\n\n© 90 Day Parts & Labor Warranty\n* Fast Service * Reliable Repairs\n\n#4 Estate Pearl, C’sted, St. Croix\n\nEast End of Hess road across from Junie's\n\nTIRE\n&\n\nBATTERY\n\nServing St. Croix Since 1964\n\n778-5962 -\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022212",
