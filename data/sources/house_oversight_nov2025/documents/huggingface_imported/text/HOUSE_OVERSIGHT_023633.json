  "text": "Some things changed. While surprisingly few others dropped him, the Clinton’s did, an irony of the present\ntabloid interest in Epstein’s old address book with its many Clinton contacts. And his sex offender status has\ntransformed him from libertine playboy to sex offender in tabloid parlance.\n\nWhile he has regularly entertained PR proposals aimed at his public rehabilitation, until Friends prodded him,\nand until this recent renewed tabloid fever, Epstein had concluded that he was perfectly satisfied living behind\nhigh walls and in his own exclusive club. Even the recent Dershowitz-Prince Andrew chapter seems like a\nparallel disturbance rather than something that is actually affecting him. His friends are as loyal as one could\nonly hope for . In speaking to quite a few, without exception they stand behind their trust and like a christain\nchorus, all say , if you only knew the real story. but Jeffrey has not made any public statements But true or not,\nthe story has taken on a life of its own, with the US and British tabloid press continuing, so far unsuccessfully,\nto search for a smoking gun connecting Clinton to underage girls, which could have—many obviously\nhope—the effect of derailing the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.\n\nIt is a curious attribute of his character that, other than perhaps being more circumspect about what legal advice\nto follow, Epstein would have done little differently. (When I suggested recently to Epstein that one obvious\nway to blunt the animus bearing down on him would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back to jail.) His\nlife, living it as he wants, seems to him to be an extraordinary accomplishment. Being on the wrong side of a\ngroups morality, custom, politics, the media, that’s just a bit of bad luck.\n\nAnd it is perhaps this attitude of his that irks his critics the most. Although he has spent more than a year in jail\nand paid out what may be as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have not been damaged as they\nwould prefer. -thats worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catchall of up-to-the-minute badness: the financier\nwhose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather than work; arich good looking ,white man who not only\nparades his wealth and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent playboy (excuse me, sex\noffender ) in a correct and prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get the memo about vast changes in\nmores and culture.\n\nBut Epstein’s friends—and I think that is, in the end, the best word for the powerful people who orbit him—are\nwilling to support him and are willing to expound on his virtues. Generous philantroppy, science funding at\nhe highest levels and a freedom of discourse that borders on dissent but often is the inspiration for great ideas. .\nEpstein is their sole confidant in many instances, Not the only nexus of them, but one of them. Dr. Epstein.\nmay i Lay on your couch. This is the back and forth, the power loop. His expertise is knowing what other\npeople want to know, combined with a lightning fast mind . Which surely offers those who are a part of the\nconversations a unique sense of confidence that they too now can understand how the world of money works.\nAnd ina time of such radical flux and existential instability, everybody wants to seek out someone who might\nhave some answers or at least make you feel like he does—even, and maybe especially, the rich.\n\nIn the last days of my interviews with Epstein, he was called by a particular world-stage individual, among the\nrichest and most powerful—proudly louche himself—who, feeling out of his depth in a world of crashing oil\nprices and wild currency fluctuation, had come to believe he might benefit from some private tutoring. Epstein\nwelcomed him to the club.\n\nplease note\n\nThe information contained in this communication 1s\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
