  "text": "So yeah, \"bondage\" -- rope, cages, etc. -- is not so much my thing. But there's one phrase\nI absolutely love: \"predicament bondage.\" Predicament bondage is usually presented in a\nvery elaborate way: for example, a submissive might be tied up with ropes binding him\nsuch that his arms are in pain -- but if he moves his arms then his legs will be in pain. It's\na predicament! And it's bondage! Whee! Predicament bondage!\n\nHowever, it doesn't have to be elaborate to be predicament bondage. I'm not into rope\nobstacle courses, but I started loving the phrase \"predicament bondage\" after a friend\nwent to a workshop run by Fetish Diva Midori and reported back. He said:\n\nMidori had two pitchers of water, or maybe a pitcher and a glass. She told us, \"This is\nthe simplest form of predicament bondage,\" and she had the demo submissive hold his\nhands straight out at shoulder height. Then she placed the water in his hands. The\nsubmissive had to keep holding the water; if he failed, he knew he would be failing\nMidori. But there was never any threat of \"Midori's wrath\" if he failed her. In fact, she\nspoke as if she was on his side, part of his team. In many ways, her sympathy for his\nplight made it all the more cruel, because she was the one doing it to him.\n\nShe explained this. She knew that his sense of disappointment in \"failing” her was worse\nthan anything she could actually do to him.\n\nSo, the predicament in that case was the submissive's increasing arm agony vs. his fear of\nfailing Midori. For me, that concept is infinitely hotter than a rope obstacle course.\nAlthough for me, in practice, I'd also want the pain to be a bit more... um... personal.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nThe first time someone flogged me, I had no idea what he was going to do beforehand; he\nand I had the strongest dominant/submissive dynamic I've ever felt, and I put myself in\nhis hands with almost-total trust. A night came around when I felt that itch under my\nskin, the dark burn in the back of my mind... I knew I had to go see him. I wasn't hugely\nexperienced, but I knew exactly what that slow burn meant.\n\nIt was late. He was in bed, and I lay down next to him. \"I think...\" I said slowly, \"I want\nyou to hurt me. A lot.\"\n\nI felt him tense beside me.\n\"Why?\" he asked.\nI didn't look at him. \"Why do you ask me questions when you already know the answer?”\n\n\"Sometimes I just want to hear you say it,\" he said, and stood up. \"Take off your clothes\nand get on your knees.”\n\nI caught my breath; did as he said. When I felt the ends of the flogger trail lightly down\nmy back, I wasn't even sure what the soft sensation meant, but I was already trembling\nanyway. I am surprised by my memory of how much it hurt when he hit me. These days,\nI don't think of floggers as especially painful, but then again, I seem to recall that he left\nmore marks than I'm used to. (I loved taking off my shirt and examining the bruises in the\nmirror. I glowed for days, afterwards.) So maybe there was something particular about\nwhat he did, or about his materials. Or maybe it's just that it was my first time.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018635",
