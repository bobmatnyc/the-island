This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nUS\nHow to detect and position for a potential Tech Bubble\nOur investment strategists recently warned against the risk of an overshoot in US Tech,\nas data on valuations, relative performance, and inflows invoke echoes of the late ‘90s.\nHowever, rising Tech vol alongside rising Tech stock prices – a classic sign of an asset\nbubble – has yet to materialize, suggesting still early stages of bubble formation.\nDerivatives can be a key tool for trading bubbles, allowing investors to capture asset\nprice upside while mitigating reversal risk. To this end, we like stock replacing FANG\npositions or overlaying Tech exposure with Nasdaq 100 (NDX) put spreads. Long\nvolatility dispersion strategies are particularly well-suited for trading asset bubbles, in\nour view, as they can profit from both the inflation and deflation of a bubble without\nneeding to time the top. Specifically, we like SPX 12M Top50 dispersion to position for\na potential Tech Bubble as (i) the Top50 basket is dominated by Tech stocks, hence\nwould benefit from any rise in their vol from currently low levels; (ii) the trade would\nbenefit from any downward pressure on broad-market correlations as Tech stocks\ndecouple from other large caps; and (iii) the late ‘90s Tech Bubble generated the most\nsustained period of elevated S&P vol dispersion in history.\nEurope\nDTE Sep17 collars can hedge DTE-TMUS merger risk; value in Enel bullish riskies\nDTE GY has run too fast, too quick: investors who own stock should consider hedging a\npullback using a Sep17 collar (+17put/-18 call for 46bps) to hedge losses greater than\n2.9% while retaining upside to 18 (stock’s ~15yr high is 18.05). Extending our EU equity\nvs credit theme to single names, we find Enel 3m bullish risk reversals screen attractive\nas Enel’s projected 12m div yield is high versus Enel CDS (suggesting value in owning\nequity vs credit) and the price of 3M bullish risk reversals is low (versus other names) as\nwell as versus history (2 nd 5y percentile).\nAsia\nBuy best-of puts to cheaply hedge a reversal in the melt-up rally\nWhile still high central bank liquidity may continue to push markets higher, heavy equity\nand option positioning suggests the risk of a market reversal. To minimize the cost of\nhedges and take advantage of the recent decline in volatility and correlation, we suggest\nowning 14-Sep-2017 95% strike best-of puts on KOSPI2/HSI/NKY at 0.8%, a 45%\ndiscount to average vanilla puts.\n>> Employed by a non-US affiliate of MLPF&S and is not registered/qualified as a research analyst under\nthe FINRA rules.\nRefer to \"Other Important Disclosures\" for information on certain BofA Merrill Lynch entities that take\nresponsibility for this report in particular jurisdictions.\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

Data on relative performance, valuation,\nand flows are reminiscent to varying degrees of the early stages of a bubble:\n• Market cap hegemony: Following the GFC, Tech stocks ousted Financials from\ntheir top position in terms of market cap and now account for 23% of the S&P500,\nthe highest %-age from any single sector since the dotcom bubble (Chart 7).\n• Dazzling growth vs. value outperformance: S&P 500 Growth stocks (SGX) on\naggregate cost ~1.4x as much as their Value counterparts (SVX), the largest\npremium since the dotcom bubble (Chart 8). Notably, the S&P 500 Growth index is\ndominated by Tech stocks, which account for 36% of its total market cap.\n• Third longest streak of monthly gains: In May, the Nasdaq 100 recorded its\nseventh consecutive monthly gain, the longest streak since 2009. Remarkably, the\nindex has managed to establish a longer streak only twice in its history, in 1986 (10\nconsecutive months) and in 1995 (8 months). The rally in these two episodes\nultimately came to an abrupt halt. However, the index would have substantial\nfurther upside from current levels if it were to achieve similar gains (Chart 9).\n• Lofty valuations: The valuation of Tech as measured by price to consensus forward\n12M earnings expectations recently hit its highest value since Nov-07 and is\nexhibiting signs of acceleration (Chart 10). However, Tech remains far cheaper than\nits dotcom bubble highs.\n• Irrational exuberance: Inflows to Tech funds are rising at their fastest annualized\nrate (25% of AUM) in 15 years, a sign of renewed exuberance.\nChart 7: The last instance where a single sector dominated SPX market\ncap as the Tech sector does now was the dotcom bubble era\n35% Sector leadership in US equities\nChart 8: Growth has only been relatively more expensive vs. Value\nduring the peak of the dotcom bubble\n1500\n1.8\n30%\n1250\n1.6\n25%\n20%\n15%\n1000\n750\n500\n1.4\n1.2\n10%\n250\n1\n1990\n1992\n1994\n1996\n1998\n2000\n2002\n2004\n2006\n2008\n2010\n2012\n2014\n2016\n0\n0.8\nTech\nFinancials\nDiscretionary\nIndustrials\nStaples\nEnergy\nLargest sector weight in the S&P500\nCurrent = 95th %-ile\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

In our view, at least for now, the spread widening is more of a response to the\noutsized sell-off seen in Tech stocks on 17-May rather than the volatility market trying\nto price in the onset of another Tech Bubble. Indeed, the -2.5% drop in the NDX on 17-\nMay was a six standard deviation (6σ) event relative to trailing realized volatility (and the\nfourth worst risk-adjusted daily return since 1985), even more extreme than the 5σ\ndecline experienced by the S&P.\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017 5\nChart 13: The -2.5% drop in the NDX on 17-May was a six standard\ndeviation (6σ) event relative to trailing realized volatility and the fourth\nworst risk-adjusted daily return since 1985\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-10\n'85 '87 '89 '91 '93 '95 '97 '99 '01 '03 '05 '07 '09 '11 '13 '15 '17\nDaily NDX return / trailing (EWMA) vol\n17-May-17\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

Importantly, as seen from Chart 11, this can occur both during the run-up to\nthe market peak as well as after the bubble pops. In other words, long vol dispersion\nstrategies can profit from both the inflation and deflation of an asset bubble, without\nrequiring an investor to time the top.\nWith the SPX Top50 largely dominated by Tech stocks (34% of total market cap) and\nwith average longer-dated single stock vol in the basket trading close to 3yr lows (12M\nSPX Top50 ATMf implied vol is in its 2 nd %-ile since Jun-14, Chart 16), we recommend\ninvestors go long 12M SPX Top50 dispersion. Chart 18 shows that such a strategy\nwould have recorded its best performance during the formation and subsequent\nbursting of the dotcom bubble as volatility increased in tandem with falling correlation\n(see Chart 11).\nImportantly, while implied correlation continues trading in a new, lower range since the\nUS election, the spread to realized correlation has remained healthy with the SPX Top50\n12M implied vs. 6M realized correlation spread in its 81 st %-ile over the past 3 years\n(Chart 17).

The\nlow short-dated implied vol is in part driven by realized vol; 10d\nis at 4.5%, which is already subdued even for the current lowvol\nregime (17th %-ile since the US election last November).\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017 9\nRates vol is near all-time lows and is favorable for positioning for a break-out\nSince the US Election last November, the 10y US Treasury rate has fluctuated between\n2.17% and 2.63%, constantly being jostled up or down by various economic forces. It is\ncurrently trading towards the bottom of that range. Our rates strategists have a yearend\ntarget of 2.85% for the 10y rate (just above the median forecast).\nLong-term rates have remained low due to uncertainty around Fiscal policy (Trump’s\nplans on infrastructure spending), subdued inflation expectations and a slower than\nexpected Fed hiking cycle. On the other hand, a near full-employment economy, hopes\nfor infrastructure spending, potential for higher inflation driven by energy prices &\nincreased government spending and an accelerated hiking cycle are providing a floor for\nlong-term rates. In the end, uncertainty remains and analysts’ estimates for the yearend\ntarget vary widely between 1.6% and 3.7% (based on 59 forecasts with median and\nmean of 2.8%).\nFor investors who believe that long-term rates will break out of their range we\nrecommend going long TLT 6m 35-delta strangles.

When the election was called on 18-April, the polls\npointed to a landslide victory for the Conservative Party. This\nboosted the UK’s currency as investors assumed that such an\noutcome would lead to a “smoother” Brexit. Indeed, on that day\nthe Sterling (GBPUSD) recorded its third best daily performance\nover the past 8 years.\nHowever, while official polls still suggest an outright majority\nfor the Conservative Party, the odds of a hung parliament have\nincreased in recent weeks. As a consequence the boost in the\ncurrency after the election was called has slightly faded. With\nsignificant further downside room to its recent pre-rally lows\nand FX markets complacent with prevailing opinion poll data,\nthere clearly could be a significant near-term correction in the\nsterling if the probability of a hung parliament becomes reality.\nHence we favor hedging downside risk in sterling via cheap FXB\nput spreads to lever steep put skew (3m 95%-ATMf implied vol\nspread at its 1-yr 90 th %-ile).\nTable 2: Current S&P500 volatility and correlation measures relative to the prior two year of historical daily data\n1-week change\nOver 2-year historical period\n2 Jun 17 26 May 17 Change\nCurrent\nranking\nMinimum 25% Median 75% Maximum\n1-month ATM implied volatility 7.4% 7.6% -0.2% 0.1% 7.4% 10.0% 11.8% 14.5% 31.8%\n1-year ATM implied volatility 13.8% 13.9% -0.1% 2.5% 13.4% 15.4% 16.2% 17.3% 22.5%\n1-week intraday realized volatility 6.2% 6.1% 0.1% 3.7% 5.2% 8.5% 10.7% 14.0% 53.7%\n1-year minus 1-month term structure 6.3% 6.3% 0.0% 97.8% -12.0% 2.7% 4.3% 5.4% 7.0%\n3-month 90 minus 110 skew 7.9% 8.7% -0.8% 4.7% 7.1% 9.5% 11.3% 11.8% 13.8%\n1-year top 50 implied correlation 45.42 45.85 -0.44 6.7% 42.03 49.79 54.34 57.14 65.55\n3-month top 50 realized correlation 27.75 30.72 -2.97 24.4% 12.57 27.90 37.28 48.45 60.41\nVIX 1-month ATMf implied vol 76.5% 75.9% 0.6% 20.4% 61.2% 77.9% 85.0% 95.2% 162.2%\nVIX 1-month 110 minus 90 skew 28.4% 28.5% -0.1% 96.2% 9.3% 18.6% 21.5% 23.8% 30.3%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017 11\nVolatility in Europe\nNotable trends and dislocations (Europe)\nEuropean equities were mostly flat over the week with the notable exception of the DAX\nwhich rallied 1.8% led by Bayer (which accounts for almost 10% of the index).

Data from 2-Jan-12 to 2-Jun-17\nNotable trends and dislocations (Asia)\nAsian equity markets saw modest gains last week, led by Japan’s NKY index, which\nincreased 2.5% week-over-week. In fact, the index breached the 20,000 mark last Friday\nfor the first time since December 2015. Gains were driven by foreign inflows from\ninvestors attracted to very strong corporate profits. Additionally, economic data from\nlast week indicated that Japan’s unemployment rate held at a two-decade low, and\ncapital spending during Q1 beat analyst estimates. The biggest contributor to last\nweeks’ return was Fast Retailing Co Ltd (9983 JT), which added 3.9% week-over-week.\nThe company reported that same-store-sales for its Uniqlo stores rose 2.4% year-overyear\nin May due to successful strategies during the Golden Week and Mother’s Day\nholidays. After the NKY, last week’s second biggest gainer was Hong Kong’s HSI, which\nadded 1.1%. The leading name in the index was Geely Automobile Holdings (175 HK),\nwhich jumped 19.8% week-over-week in response to optimism over its recent\nacquisition of a 49.9% stake in Proton Holdings. Hong Kong’s HSCEI saw a similar return\nas the index added 0.8% last week.\nNext we turn to India, where the NIFTY gained 0.6% last week. The leading name in the\nindex was Aurobindo Pharma (ARBP IS), which increased 11.4% week-over-week in\nresponse to an investor presentation which outlined the company’s plans to increase\ncollaboration across its global customer business. Elsewhere in Asia, Korea’s KOSPI\nincreased 0.3% week-over-week, Australia’s ASX added 0.6%, and Taiwan’s TWSE\ngained 0.5%.\nAsian term structures were unchanged week-over-week at 3.8% on average\n• Asian 3m ATM volatility increased on average 0.1 vol point to 12.6% last week,\nwhile 10 day realized vol fell on average 0.8 vol points to 8.6%. Notably, NIFTY’s\nimplied vol increased 0.7 vol points, the biggest increase in the region. On the other\nhand, the HSCEI’s 10d realized vol saw the largest drop in the region, falling 5.1 vol\npoints week-over-week to 9.2%.\n• On average, term structures among Asian indices remained unchanged at 3.8% last\nweek. The KOSPI 12M-1M term structure steepened the most, increasing 0.7 vol\npoints to 2.9%. On the other hand, India’s NIFTY saw the largest flattening as its\nterm structure flattened 0.5 vol point to 3.8%.\n• Asian 3M 90-110% skews narrowed 0.2 vol points on average to 3.0%.

Products issued in Oct-16\n(US$3.1bn) and Nov-2016 (US$3.4bn) have knocked out recently and rolled into\nnew products. However, the legacy HSCEI-linked products issued in May-15 were\nstruck at a very high HSCEI spot level and were not able to knock-out this month.\nWe think issuance may pick up in July and August as ~US$4.0bn of legacy products\nmay knock-out in Jul-17 with an average HSCEI knock-out level of 9665 (Chart 43).\n• Issuance in KOSPI2-linked products (up from US$840mn to US$846mn) remained\nsteady in May-17; HSI-linked products fell 66% from US$360mn to US$120mn as\ninvestors prefered HSCEI-linked products (which only fell from US$760mn to\nUS$700mn).\n• SX5E-linked (US$1.0bn), KOSPI2-linked (US$846mn), HSCEI-linked (US$700mn),\nand SPX-linked products (US$550mn) accounted for 86% of the May-17 issuance.\nWe estimate that structured product issuers are currently long US$10mn of KOSPI2\nvega and US$89mn HSCEI vega respectively. The majority of the US$89mn HSCEI\noutstanding vega came from the US$14bn of HSCEI-linked legacy products issued\nbetween Apr-15 and Jul-15 that have not knocked-out.\n20 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017\nNKY Uridashi monthly issuance slightly picked-up in May-17\nWith NKY breaking above 19,500 in May and triggering some early knock-outs, Japanese\nUridashi issuance picked up towards the end of May to US$630mn.

The most severe risks associated with general options\ntrading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can\noccur in a short period.\nInvestor suitability\nThe use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are\nconsidered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are\nencouraged to become familiar with the \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized\nOptions\" (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult\nwith a FINRA Registered Options Principal.

For purposes of this Investment Rating Distribution, the coverage universe includes only stocks. A\nstock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s).
