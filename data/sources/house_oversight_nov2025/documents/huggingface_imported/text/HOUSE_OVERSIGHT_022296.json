  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54025\n\ninterpretation would be reasonable,\nbecause it is contrary to the plain\nlanguage of the notice. The notice states\nthat promises or grants of benefits “to\ndiscourage or encourage union support”’\nare unlawful. It would make little sense\nto use such language if the Board had\nmeant that any promises or grants of\nbenefits were unlawful, rather than only\nthose with the unlawful stated\npurposes. And stating that such\npromises or grants to * * * encourage\nunion support are unlawful necessarily\nimplies that not all promises and grants\nof benefits discourage union support.\n\nvi. Prohibitions on Union Insignia\n\nA few comments suggest that the\nprovision fails to illuminate the\nconditions under which “‘special\ncircumstances” may exist, including in\nhotels or retail establishments where the\ninsignia may interfere with the\nemployer’s public image, or when the\ninsignia is profane or vulgar. Another\ncomment indicates that the provision is\noverly broad because it does not reflect\nthat a violation depends on the work\nenvironment and the content of the\ninsignia. All the comments addressing\nthis provision suggest either adding\nmore detail to the provision to narrow\nits meaning, or striking the provision\nentirely.\n\nAgain, the Board disagrees.\nEmployees have a statutorily protected\nright to wear union insignia unless the\nemployer is able to demonstrate\n“special circumstances” that justify a\nprohibition. Republic Aviation Corp. v.\nNLEB, 324 U.S. 793 (1945). For reasons\nof format, the notice cannot\naccommodate those comments\nsuggesting that this provision specify\ncases in which the Board has found\n“special circumstances,’ such as where\ninsignia might interfere with production\nor safety; where it conveys a message\nthat is obscene or disparages a\ncompany’s product or service; where it\ninterferes with an employer’s attempts\nto have its employees project a specific\nimage to customers; where it hinders\nproduction; where it causes disciplinary\nproblems in the plant; where it is in an\nimmediate patient care areas; or where\nit would have any other consequences\nthat would constitute special\ncircumstances under settled precedent.\nNLEB v. Mead Corp., 73 F.3d 74, 79 (6th\nCir. 1996), enfg. Escanaba Paper Co.,\n314 NLRB 732 (1994).\n\nGiven the lengthy list of potential\nspecial circumstances, the addition of\none or two examples of special\ncircumstances might mislead or confuse\nemployees into thinking that the right to\nwear union insignia in all other\ncircumstances was absolute. And\n\nincluding an entire list of special\ncircumstances, concerning both the\nwearing of union insignia and other\nmatters (e.g., striking and picketing,\nsoliciting and distributing union\nliterature), would make it impossible to\nsummarize NLRA rights on an 11x17\ninch poster. In any event, the Board\nfinds that the general caveat that special\ncircumstances may defeat the\napplication of the general rule, coupled\nwith the advice to employees to contact\nthe NLRB with specific questions about\nparticular issues, achieves the balance\nrequired for an employee notice of\nrights about wearing union insignia in\nthe workplace.\nvii. Spying or Videotaping\n\nAside from the few comments that\nsuggest the provision be stricken, only\none comment specifically addresses the\ncontent of this provision. The comment\nstates that the language is confusing\nbecause a “‘supervisor might believe it\nwould be permissible to photograph or\ntape record a union meeting. Another\nmight say that their video camera\ndoesn’t use tape so it’s okay to use.”’ The\nBoard has determined that no change is\nnecessary. In the Board’s view, it is\nunlikely that a reasonable supervisor\nwould construe this notice language\n(which also says that it is unlawful to\n“spy on” employees’ peaceful union\nactivities) as indicating that it is\nunlawful to videotape, but lawful to\ntape record or photograph, such\nactivities. Supervisors are free to contact\nthe Board if they are unsure whether a\ncontemplated response to union activity\nmight be unlawful.\n\nviii. Other Suggested Additions to\nIllegal Employer Conduct\n\nThe Heritage Foundation suggests that\nthe Board add language to the notice\ninforming employees that if they choose\nto be represented by a union, their\nemployer may not give them raises or\nbonuses for good performance without\nfirst bargaining with the union. The\ncomment suggests that the Board add\nthe following provision “if a union\nrepresents you and your co-workers,\ngive you a pay raise or a bonus, or\nreduce or dock your pay, without\nnegotiating with the union.” The Board\nrejects this suggestion for the same\nreason it rejects other comments\ncontending that the notice should\ninclude the consequences of\nunionization in the summary of NLRA\nrights, above.\n\nThe National Immigration Law Center\nsuggests that the Board add the\nfollowing to the notice poster:\n\nUnder the NLRA, it is illegal for your\nemployer to: Report you or threaten to report\n\nyou to Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement (ICE) or to other law\nenforcement authorities in order to\nintimidate or retaliate against you because\nyou join or support a union, or because you\nengage in concerted activity for mutual aid\nand protection.\n\nThe Board finds it unnecessary to add\nthis statement. The notice states that it\nis unlawful for an employer to “fire,\ndemote, or transfer you, or reduce your\nhours or change your shift, or otherwise\ntake adverse action against you, or\nthreaten to take any of these actions,\nbecause you join or support a union, or\nbecause you engage in concerted\nactivity for mutual aid and protection\n(emphasis added) [.]”’ Reporting or\nthreatening to report an employee in the\nmanner described in the comment\nwould be a form of adverse action or\nthreat thereof, and the Board believes\nthat it would be understood as such.\n\nd. Examples of Illegal Union Activity\n\nThe proposed notice contained the\nfollowing examples of unlawful union\nconduct:\n\nUnder the NLRA, it is illegal for a\nunion or for the union that represents\nyou in bargaining with your employer\nto:\n\nThreaten you that you will lose your job\nunless you support the union.\n\nRefuse to process a grievance because you\nhave criticized union officials or because you\nare not a member of the union.\n\nUse or maintain discriminatory standards\nor procedures in making job referrals from a\nhiring hall.\n\nCause or attempt to cause an employer to\ndiscriminate against you because of your\nunion-related activity.\n\nTake other adverse action against you\nbased on whether you have joined or support\nthe union.\n\n75 FR 80419.\n\nThere were only a few comments\naddressing specific changes to the\nlanguage in this section of the notice.\nALFA criticizes the provision that states\nthat a union may not “threaten you that\nyou will lose your job unless you\nsupport the union,” because the\nproposed language “fails to capture\nSection 8(b)(1)(A)’s broader prohibition\nagainst restraint and coercion.’’ The\ncomment suggests revising the language\nto state that a union may not “[rlestrain\nor coerce you in the exercise of your\nright to refrain from joining a union by\nthreatening to inflict bodily harm or\nfollowing you to your home and\nrefusing to leave unless you sign a\nunion card.” That comment also\nsuggests adding a provision stating that\nit is unlawful for a union to ‘promise\nto waive your union initiation fee if you\nagree to sign a union card before a vote\nis taken.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022296",
