He could not have done so without\nviolating his sworn oath and, for that matter, U.S. anti-espionage\nstatutes. Binney made it clear to her and other journalists that he\nwas not a lawbreaker. But her new source, C4, was willing to do\nwhat Binney (and other insiders) had refused to do. He was offer-\ning in these e-mails to provide her with secret government docu-\nments, even though it would implicate him as an outlaw. To further\nwhet her appetite, he told her that these up-to-date NSA documents\nwould fully substantiate the allegations that Binney made in her\nfilm. Even more important, he said Binney’s 2001 disclosures were\nstill relevant to her cause. “What you know as Stellarwind has\ngrown,” he wrote to her. “The expanded special source operations\nthat took over Stellarwind’s share of the pie have spread all over the\nworld to practically include comprehensive coverage of the United\nStates.” In fact, as Snowden knew from the Inspector General report\nhe had read, the NSA had terminated Stellarwind almost a decade\nearlier. President Bush ended it after top officials of the Justice\n© Department insisted that he did not have the legal authority for the ©\ndomestic part of Stellarwind. Instead, he asked Congress to revise\nFISA to meet the objections of the Justice Department. The result\nwas the FISA Amendment Act of 2006. Unlike the previous Stel-\nlarwind program, it did not permit domestic surveillance. It speci-\nfied that the government could not target any person in the United\nStates or anywhere else in the world under this authority. Nor could\nit target any foreign person, even one residing outside of the United\nStates, to acquire information from a particular known person inside\nthe United States. As the act recognized that information about U.S.\ncitizens might mistakenly be intercepted by the NSA, it required\nthat such data about Americans be expunged in a bimonthly review\nby a Justice Department task force. Although the NSA program in\nplace in 2013 was not the comprehensive domestic surveillance that\nSnowden claimed it to be, Poitras had no way of knowing at this\nearly state that her source was misleading her.\nHe offered to substantiate her worst fears about the growth of\nNSA surveillance: “I know the location of most domestic intercep-\ntion points, and that the largest telecommunication companies in the\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 67 ® 9/30/16 11:09 AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019555",
