  "text": "Patrick Seale\n\n12 Feb 2013 -- Negotiations with Iran are\nonce more on the international agenda.\nAfter an eight-month break, the five\npermanent members of the UN Security\nCouncil plus Germany -- the so-called\nP5+1 -- are due to hold a meeting with Iran\non 25 February in Kazakhstan. What are\nthe prospects of success? In a nutshell, that\nwould seem to depend more on the climate\nin Washington than in Tehran. Iran is\ngesturing that it wants to negotiate, but\nWashington has not yet signalled any\ngreater flexibility than in the past.\n\nIn a major speech in Tehran last Sunday,\nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\naddressed the United States: “Take your\nguns out of the face of the Iranian nation\nand I myself will negotiate with you,” he\ndeclared. Meanwhile, the Iranian\nambassador to Paris told French officials\nthat, provided a work plan was agreed, Iran\nwas ready to allow inspectors of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA) to visit Parchin, a military facility\nwhere Iran is suspected of having done\nwork on atomic weapons. Ahmadinejad\nhimself has said repeatedly that Iran was\nready to stop enriching uranium to 20% if\nthe international community agreed to\nsupply it instead to the Tehran research\nreactor for the production of isotopes\nneeded to treat cancer patients.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028685",
