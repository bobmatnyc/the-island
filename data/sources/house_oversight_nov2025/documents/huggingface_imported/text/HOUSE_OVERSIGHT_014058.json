  "text": "2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 79\n\nserve as a basis for identifying a “crime victim’ as defined in the CVRA, the\nclass of victims with statutory rights may well be broader.””'°’\n\nPaletz and Skinner similarly provide scant support for the\nDepartment’s position. In Skinner, a prison inmate attempted to bring a pro\nse civil suit against another inmate for allegedly attacking him during\nincarceration.'°* In dismissing the suit in an unpublished decision, the\ndistrict court recognized that the Government had expressly declined to\nbring charges against the other inmate and concluded that the CVRA did\nnot create a “mechanism to bring an action against Defendant directly.”!”\nIn Paletz, that same inmate brought a similar pro se claim against another\ninmate, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney\nGeneral.!'° In a parallel, unpublished decision, the district court dismissed\nthe suit, noting that the CVRA is designed to give victims certain rights\n‘Within the prosecutorial process against a criminal defendant.”!\"!\n\nBecause Skinner and Paletz involve (apparently frivolous) civil suits,\nthey say nothing about the CVRA’s reach in criminal cases, and any\nlanguage to that effect would be pure dicta. Moreover, the courts’ terse\nanalysis in both cases does not contain any substantive discussion of\nwhether CVRA rights apply in criminal cases before the filing of charges.\nInstead, the courts simply cited to language from a Second Circuit decision\nthat stated that the CVRA does not give victims any rights against\ndefendants until those defendants have been convicted'!’—a holding clearly\nlimited to restitution, as many other CVRA rights clearly apply before\nconviction.''* Reviewing these two cases in an extended, published\nopinion, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas noted that\nreading these two decisions as standing for the proposition that charges\nmust be filed for CVRA rights to attach “appears inconsistent with the\nCVRA recognition of certain subsection (a) rights that apply during\ninvestigation, before any charging instrument is filed.”'!* As a result, OLC\n\n°T Td. at 326.\n\n°8 Skinner, 2006 WL 1677177, at *1-2.\n\nTd. at *2.\n\n10 Searcy v.

See 18 U.S.C. § 3664 (2012) (describing sentencing\nprocedures for ordering restitution).\n\n14 United States v. BP Prods. N. Am. Inc., No. H-07-434, 2008 WL 501321, at *12 n.7\n(S.D. Tex.
