  "text": "Attorney: Police gave media ‘distorted view’\n\n> EPSTEIN from 1B\n\nThey did that Monday via Gold-\nberger and a Los Angeles publicist\nfor Miami criminal defense attorney\nRoy Black, who also has represented\nEpstein in the case.\n\n“We just think there has been a\ndistorted view of this case in the me-\ndia presented by the Palm Beach po-\nlice,” Goldberger said.\n\nReiter has consistently declined\nto comment on the case and did not\nrespond to a request for comment\nMonday.\n\nThe implication that State Attor-\nney Barry Krischer was easy on Ep-\nstein by presenting the case to a\ngrand jury rather than filing charges\n\ndirectly against him is wrong, Gold-\nberger said.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Depart-\nment was “happy and ecstatic” that\nthe panel was going to review the\nevidence, “I think what happened is\nthey weren’t happy with the result.\nThey decided to use the press to\nembarrass Mr. Epstein.”\n\nBut records show that Reiter\nwrote Krischer on May 1 — well be-\nfore the case went to the grand jury —\nsuggesting that Krischer “consider if\ngood and sufficient reason exists to\nrequire your disqualification from the\nprosecution of these cases.”\n\nRather than flat-out decline to\ncharge Epstein, Krischer referred\nthe case to the grand jury to “ap-\n\npease” the chief, Goldberger said.\n\nA state attorneys spokesman\nwould say only that the office refers\ncases to the grand jury when there\nare issues with the viability of the\nevidence or witnesses’ credibility.\n\nBoth the state attorney and the\ngrand jury concluded there was not\nsufficient evidence that Epstein had\nsex with minors, according to Gold-\nberger. “It was just a childish perfor-\nmance by the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment,” Goldberger said.\n\nThe defense attorney said one of\nthe alleged victims who claimed she\nwas a minor was in fact over the age\nof 18. Another alleged victim who\nwas subpoenaed to testify to the\n\ngrand jury failed to do so. Epstein’s\n\n(@) lay. fells#pbpst com\n\nEpstein investigation\n\nRead a letter from Palm Beach Police\nChief Michael Reiter to State Attorney\nBarry Krischer on the Epstein probe.\nPalmBeachPost.com\n\naccusers, he added, have histories of\ndrug abuse and thefts. “These wom-\nen are liars. We've established that.”\n\nBut why would they all invent\ntheir stories about meeting Epstein\nfor sexual massages?\n\n“I don’t have an answer as to what\nwas the motivation for these women\nto come forward and make these al-\nlegations,” Goldberger said.\n\n&\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018936",
