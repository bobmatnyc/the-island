  "text": "side of the showroom and see the city being\nbuilt, and reality starts sinking in.\"\n\nIt's a type of living closely associated with\nthe Palestinians’ neighbors in Israel. \"They\nknow very well that just a 20-minute drive\naway, there's a community with a much\nhigher standard of living. And that\ncommunity happened to be one\nrepresenting the occupier, quote-unquote\nthe 'enemy.'’ But they would love to live\nlike that. And that's why when they come\nto Rawabi some of them don't believe this\nis for them initially. The first thing that\ngoes through their mind is that this could\nbe for the Israelis.\"\n\nBut it is for them. Rawabi's significance\ncould lie in something more mundane than\nbasic issues of sovereignty and control in\nthe West Bank. It lies in the common,\nhuman desire -- powerful on either side of\nthe Green Line -- for a comfortable and\ndignified existence.\n\nIn some quarters, this idea of working\nwithin the present and less-than-ideal\npolitical and economic framework to\nachieve this goal is nothing short of\ninflammatory. The U.S.-based, anti-peace\nprocess website Electronic Intifada has\nsmeared Masri as an Israeli collaborator,\nand there have been scattered accusations\nthat the project actually legitimizes Israeli\ncontrol over the West Bank.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028718",
