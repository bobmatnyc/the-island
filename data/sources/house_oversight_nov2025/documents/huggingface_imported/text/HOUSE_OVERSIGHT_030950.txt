What else are you interested in? Peter is best for currency; maybe Reid Hoffman (fatty at LinkedIn) or Dave
Morin (Path) or Drew Houston (Dropbox).

I do believe China offers the best opportunities for Sinofsky. Problem is after Windows, pretty much everything
else in the US is a step down. No-one else is building an OS. Alibaba or Xiaomi in China are. But if he wants to
stay in the US, then probably the best options are Facebook (who may one day do their own OS), Palantir (Peter
Thiel's), Yahoo (where Marissa is aggressively seeking out senior talent). Then of course, there is Apple and
Google - but I assume he doesn't want to be a traitor to Microsoft?

Are you back now in NY?

I'm in London but staying up to watch the Obama speech. Hosain's really keen to close this out by Monday...
It would help me a lot if we can finish this for once and for all.

I'm in Munich Saturday, then St. Petersburg and Moscow with Eike Sunday-Tuesday (we've got some terrific
meetings lined up), London Wednesday-Thursday (including Mubadala board meeting Wed.) and then heading
to SF next Friday 14th.... you will arrive on the 16th? Shall we do Peter Thiel for drinks then?

Best wishes,

Jan
