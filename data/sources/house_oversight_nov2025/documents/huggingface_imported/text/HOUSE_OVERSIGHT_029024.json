  "text": "Argentina, where you have this kind of crony capitalism of people that are involved with\nthese military powers-that-be in the government, and it forms a brutal form of capitalism\nthat is really about creating wealth and creating value for a very small subset of people.\nAnd it doesn’t spread the tremendous value creation throughout broader distribution\npatterns that were seen really in the 20th century.\n\nThe second form of capitalism that I feel is almost as disturbing, is what I call the Ayn\nRand or the Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism. And, look, I’m a big believer in a\nlot of libertarianism. I have many many friends that’s a very big part of the conservative\nmovement — whether it’s the UKIP movement in England, it’s many of the underpinnings\nof the populist movement in Europe, and particularly in the United States.\n\nHowever, that form of capitalism is quite different when you really look at it to what I call\nthe “enlightened capitalism” of the Judeo-Christian West. It is a capitalism that really\nlooks to make people commodities, and to objectify people, and to use them almost — as\nmany of the precepts of Marx — and that is a form of capitalism, particularly to a younger\ngeneration [that] they’re really finding quite attractive. And if they don’t see another\nalternative, it’s going to be an alternative that they gravitate to under this kind of rubric of\n\n“personal freedom.”\n\n“Look at what’s happening in ISIS ... look at\nthe sophistication of which they’ve taken the\ntools of capitalism ... at what they’ve done\nwith Twitter and Facebook.”\n\nThe other tendency is an immense secularization of the West. And I know we've talked\nabout secularization for a long time, but if you look at younger people, especially\nmillennials under 30, the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely secularize\n\nthis rising iteration.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029024",
