First, if the\nreported productivity growth rates are accurate,\nthen the exceptionally low rates of the last 10 years\naccount for part of the slow pace of this recovery.\nHowever, the current low productivity growth rates\ndo not portend low growth rates going forward.\nJust as Hansen was proven wrong on his secular\nstagnation theory and Krugman was proven wrong\non his diminished expectations for the US economy\n(and they were both influenced by their pessimistic\nview on productivity), those who extrapolate\nstagnation from the current productivity trends\nmay be proven wrong as well.\n\nSecond, as we discuss below, there is also a high\nprobability that real GDP may be mismeasured.\n\nIf real GDP is mismeasured, it follows that\n\nIf real GDP is mismeasured, it follows\nthat productivity is also mismeasured,\nthereby invalidating the whole theory of\nsecular stagnation and the decline of the\n\nUS economy.\n\nproductivity is also mismeasured, thereby\ninvalidating the whole theory of secular stagnation\nand the decline of the US economy.\n\nMismeasurement of GDP Statistics\nIn addition to the productivity debate, there is\na debate as to whether we are measuring GDP\ncorrectly in the first place. The key argument being\nmade is that while we correctly measure the value\nof nominal GDP based on the value of goods and\nservices, we mismeasure the value of real GDP\nwhen we convert nominal GDP to real GDP using\nvarious price indices, and this therefore understates\nthe pace of this recovery. This debate garnered\nconsiderable attention in 2016.\n\nThe mismeasurement argument states that\nthe official price indices do not adequately reflect\nsignificant improvements in many products,\nespecially in information and communication\ntechnology, due to the methodology\nused by the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (BLS) and the BEA. If the\nprice indices do not adequately\nreflect the greater capacity of\nan improved product such as a\nsmartphone or a microprocessor,\nthen the price index used to convert\nnominal GDP to real GDP is too\nhigh. And if the price index is too\nhigh, then real GDP is understated.\n\n14 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014547",
