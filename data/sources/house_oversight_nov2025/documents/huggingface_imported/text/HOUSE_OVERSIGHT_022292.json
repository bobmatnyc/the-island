  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54021\n\nmisleading and vague. The first\ncomment, from COLLE, argues that the\nprovision is misleading because it fails\nto acknowledge that an employer does\nnot have an obligation under the NLRA\nto consent to the establishment of a\ncollective-bargaining agreement, but\ninstead only has the statutory duty to\n“meet at reasonable times and confer in\ngood faith with respect to wages, hours,\nand other terms and conditions of\nemployment.” 29 U.S.C. 158(d). The\ncomment also argues that the failure to\nreach an agreement is not per se\nunlawful, and the finding of an unfair\nlabor practice depends on whether the\nparties engaged in good-faith bargaining.\nThis comment suggests that the notice\nshould instead note that the NLRA\nrequires parties to bargain in good faith\nbut does not compel agreement or the\nmaking of concessions, and that, in\nsome instances, a bargaining impasse\nwill result, permitting the parties to\nexercise their economic weapons, such\nas strikes or lockouts. The second\ncomment, made generally by more than\na few organizations and individuals,\nsuggests that the notice add a statement\nindicating that employers and unions\nhave an obligation to bargain in good\nfaith.\n\nThe Board finds it unnecessary to add\nthe suggested amplifications. For one\nthing, the notice does state that\nemployers and unions have a duty to\nbargain in good faith, “in a genuine\neffort to reach a written, binding\nagreement setting your terms and\nconditions of employment.” In the\nBoard’s view, the statement that the\nparties must make a ‘‘genuine effort” to\nreach agreement necessarily implies that\nthey are not, in the end, required to\nreach one. The Board deems the notice\nlanguage to be adequate on this point.\nFinally, for the reasons already\ndiscussed, the Board rejects the\ncontention that the notice should\ndiscuss the implications or\nconsequences of unsuccessful\nbargaining.\n\niii. The Right To Discuss With Co-\nWorkers or Union\n\nA comment from the National\nImmigration Law Center suggests that\nthe use of the phrase “terms and\nconditions of employment” is unclear\nespecially to employees who are\nunaware of their rights under the NLRA.\nThe comment recommends that, in\norder to clarify, the Board add the\nphrase “including wages and benefits.”\nThe suggested language would read,\n“you have the right to: discuss your\nterms and conditions of employment,\nincluding wages and benefits, or union\n\norganizing with your co-workers ora\nunion.”\n\nThe Board agrees that adding the\nsuggested language would clarify the\nprovision. The list of affirmative rights\nuses the terms ‘‘wages, hours, and other\nterms and conditions of employment” to\ndescribe what unions may negotiate.\nThe notice then uses the terms “wages,\nbenefits, hours, and other working\nconditions” to describe the right to\nbargain collectively for a contract. Those\nstatements make it clear that “terms and\nconditions of employment” includes\nwages and benefits. But then\nimmediately following those two\nstatements, the notice states that\nemployees may discuss ‘“‘terms and\nconditions of employment,” but does\nnot include any clarifying language. In\norder, to create a more uniform notice\nand clarify the extent to which\nemployees may discuss their terms and\nconditions of employment the final\nnotice will read, “Under the NLRA, you\nhave a right to: Discuss your wages and\nbenefits and other terms and conditions\nof employment or union organizing with\nyour co-workers or a union.”\n\niv. The Right To Strike and Picket\n\nThe notice’s reference to the right to\nstrike and picket received a few\ncomments from law firms and other\norganizations representing employers’\ninterests. The comments suggest that the\nprovision is flawed because of the\nabsence of further limitations,\nexceptions, and distinctions.1°¢\nGenerally, the comments argue that not\nall strikes and pickets are protected.\nCOLLE argues that the notice should\ninform employees of the limitations of\nstrikes encompassed by “depending on\nthe purpose or means of the strike or\npickets’’—for example, whether the\nstrike is for recognition or bargaining,\nwhether the strike has a secondary\npurpose, whether picketing involves a\nreserved gate, whether the strike is a sit-\ndown or minority strike, whether the\nconduct is a slowdown and not a full\nwithholding of work, whether the strike\nis partial or intermittent, whether the\nstrike involves violence, and whether\nthe strike is an unfair labor practice\nstrike or an economic strike. ALFA\nargues that employees should be\ninformed that if the employer is a\nhealthcare institution, “employees do\nnot have the right to participate in a\nunion-initiated strike or picket unless\nthe union has provided the employer\nand federal and state mediation agencies\nwith the required 10 days notice.”\n\n106 See comments of ALFA, Carrollton Health and\nRehabilitation Center, and COLLE.\n\nThe Board disagrees. By necessity, an\n11x17-inch notice cannot contain an\nexhaustive list of limitations on and\nexceptions to the rights to strike and\npicket, as suggested by employers.\nHowever, because exercising the right to\nstrike can significantly affect the\nlivelihood of employees, the Board\nconsiders it important to alert\nemployees that there are some\nlimitations to exercising this right. The\nBoard is satisfied that the general\ncaveat, “depending on the purpose or\nmeans of the strike or the picketing,”\ntogether with the instruction to contact\nthe NLRB with specific questions about\nthe application of rights in certain\nsituations, provides sufficient guidance\nto employees about the exercise of their\nrights while still staying within the\nconstraints set by a necessarily brief\nemployee notice.\n\nv. The Right To Refrain From Union or\nOther Protected Concerted Activity\n\nAll the comments that discuss the\nright to refrain from engaging in union\nactivity criticize what they contend to\nbe its lack of prominence. ALFA accuses\nthe Board of ‘‘burying” the provision by\nplacing it last, below the other rights to\nengage in union and other concerted\nactivity. The U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce suggests that the notice\ninclude “‘or not’”’ after each of the\nenumerated rights. For example, ‘‘you\nhave the right to: form join or assist a\nunion, or not.” (Emphasis added.) Other\nsuggested revisions to amplify the\nprominence of the provision include\nstating that employees have the right to\nrefrain from protected, concerted\nactivities and/or union activities; stating\nthat employees’ right to refrain includes\nthe right to actively oppose\nunionization, to not sign union\nauthorization cards, to request a secret\nballot election, to not be a member of a\nunion or pay dues or fees (addressed\nfurther below), or to decertify a union\n(also addressed below); and stating that\nemployees have the right to be fairly\nrepresented even if not a member of the\nunion. One employer suggests that if the\nnotice retains its current emphasis\nfavoring union activity and disfavoring\nthe freedom to refrain from such\nactivity, employers will need to post\ntheir own notices that emphasize and\nelaborate on the right to refrain.\n\nThe Board received at least four\ncomments that argue that the notice, as\nwritten, may make employees believe\nthat the employer is encouraging\nunionization. Two of those comments\nsuggest that an employer is protected\nfrom compelled speech by Section 8(c)\nof the NLRA. (The Board has already\nrejected the latter argument; see section\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022292",
