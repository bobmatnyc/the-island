(After finally leaving Snowden in Moscow\non November 3, 2013, Harrison moved to Berlin, where she set up\nan organization to provide, as she termed it, “an underground rail-\nroad” for other fugitives who had made available documents expos-\ning government secrets.)\n\nSnowden was sequestered in the transit zone of the Moscow air-\nport for thirty-seven days. A Russian intermediary provided him\nwith a Russian classic to read while awaiting asylum.
