In our view, at least for now, the spread widening is more of a response to the\n\noutsized sell-off seen in Tech stocks on 17-May rather than the volatility market trying\nto price in the onset of another Tech Bubble. Indeed, the -2.5% drop in the NDX on 17-\nMay was a six standard deviation (60) event relative to trailing realized volatility (and the\nfourth worst risk-adjusted daily return since 1985), even more extreme than the 50\ndecline experienced by the S&P.\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Global Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017 5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023579",
