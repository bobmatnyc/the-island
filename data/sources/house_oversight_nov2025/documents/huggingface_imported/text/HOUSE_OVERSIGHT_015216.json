  "text": "“It'’ s charming,” I reply, “but what are you gonna do if the metal\ndetector goes off at the airport?”\n\n| leave them giggling in the elevator as | get off on a floor where\nI' ve heard there would be lots of action. | follow one group, but only the\ncouple in front really knows where they’ re going. But they happen to be\non the way to their own room, and when they get there, they go in, close\nthe door, and we are all left out in the corridor, looking like a perplexed\nant farm. Everybody turns around. | am now at the front of the line, so | let\nthem all pass by me as they head in the opposite direction, strolling\nbriskly, except for the one-legged man with the roller skate and crutches,\nwho is gliding gracefully along the carpet. Passersby are asked, in vain,\n\n“Where’ s the party?” We finally find a room with a porn photo on the\ndoor, which is slightly open.\n\nInside, there are around fifty people in semi-darkness. Exhibitionists\nand voyeurs, together again. Here a blow job, there a copulation,\neverywhere an undulating juiciness. There is an unspoken\nhomophobia—no man is relating sexually to another man—but there is\nlots of lesbian libido. In order to keep a low profile, | have ripped several\npages out of my notebook and folded them in half, so that | can take\n\nnotes unobtrusively.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015216",
