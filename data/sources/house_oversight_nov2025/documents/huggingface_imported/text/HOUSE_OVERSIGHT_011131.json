Since this differential component of asset value defers all positive cash\nflow until moment z, and cannot in itself be affected by later transfers in, q\nsimplifies by (A1.6a) to rate of return. This was Boehm Bawerk’s insight, although\nhe was not mathematical, in equating time preference rate to rate of return r. Thus\n\n(2.2) and (2.3) give\n\ndPV(x)dx=F, (zje\"’ dz and F (z)dz= dPV(xJe™’™, (A2.4)\n\nwhere r is the appropriate rate of return and time discount rate equivalently.\n\nBut what determines appropriate r in these equations? Rate of return varies with\nrisk among different assets at the same time, and varies over time with economic\ncircumstances. Most sources I have seen treat r in (A2.4) as a variable to be\n\nintegrated over (x, z). | myself long believed the same.\n\nMy view now looks to the context. The asset as a whole will typically have received\nmany differential investments before time x, and may receive many after. Each at\ninception will have been priced by the owner’s time preference rate then. But my\n\ntheme in risk theory is that assets can be traded or modified to the current owner's\n\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011131",
