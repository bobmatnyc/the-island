Do you recall being taught long multiplication\nat school? Take a look at the next illustration and it will all come flooding\nback. Once you learn the process of long multiplication you can follow\nthe rules and get the right answer for any similar problem every time. To\ndo this, you lay out the calculation in a particular format and apply the\nlogic. Multiply each number by a single digit of the other number and\nthen add the results together.\n\nDiophantine problems are a little more complex than long\nmultiplication and some of them are a bit abstruse. But there is one\nvery famous Diophantine problem we can all recite. “The square on the\nhypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides” The\nequation for a Pythagorean triangle.\n\nThe theorem applies to right-angled triangles and there are sixteen\nwhole number solutions, known as Pythagorean triples; three, four, five;\nis one example.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015930",
