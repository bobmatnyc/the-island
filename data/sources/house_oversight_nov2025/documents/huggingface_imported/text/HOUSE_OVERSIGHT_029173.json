It would force both the\nsubstantive issues of obstruction and abuse of power and the meta\nissues of Presidential immunity—the hot button issues of the\nPresident's claims to being above the law—into open court for a long\nand painful review and dissection that might shadow the November\nelection.\n\nLegal experts believe that the Mueller team might well prevail in\nlower courts with a less likely, but not at all certain outcome, in the\nSupreme Court.\n\n“Might such an expansive claim win, yes. Should it win, no. But\neveryone knows the reality: weak president's lose cases, strong\npresident's win them.\"\n\nWere the case to reach the Supreme Court after the November\nelection, it might well be the results of that election that help seal the\nPresident's fate not just in Congress but also in the courts.\n\nMORE TK\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029173",
