  "text": "34 MICHAEL WOLFE\n\nupon hearing, that he was not a target and would shortly be exonerated.\nBut the lawyers went even further with their feel-good strategy.\n\nPresidents, faced with hostile investigations by the other coequal\nbranches of government, Congress and the judiciary, invariably cite exec-\nutive privilege both as a legitimate principle and as a dilatory tactic. It’s a\nbuilt-in bargaining chip. But Trump’s lawyers, hoisted by how often they\nhad to assure the president that he had nothing to fear, supported their\nconfident assessment, to Trump’s delight, by dispensing with any claim\nof executive privilege and willingly satisfying all the special counsel's\nrequests. Trump, in all his dodginess, had become an open book. What's\nmore, Trump himself, ever believing in the force and charm of his own\npersonality, was, with his attorneys’ apparent assent, eager to testify.\n\nAnd yet, Bannon knew, it was still much worse. The president's law-\nyers had sent more than 1.1 million documents to the special counsel,\naided by only a scant document production team. It was just Dowd,\nCobb, and two inexperienced assistants. In major litigations, docu-\nments are meticulously logged and cross-referenced into elaborate and\nefficient database systems. Here, they shipped over much of the material\nmerely as attachments, and kept minimal or no records of what exactly\nhad been sent. Few in the White House knew what they had given up and\nthus what the special counsel had. And the haphazard approach didn’t\nstop there. Dowd and Cobb neither prepared many of the witnesses who\nhad worked for the White House in advance of their testimony to Mueller’s\nteam nor debriefed them after they testified.\n\nBannon was overcome by the hilarity and stupidity of this what-me-\nworry approach to federal prosecutors whose very reputations depended\non nailing the president. Trump needed a plan—which, of course, Ban-\nnon had.\n\nBannon swore that he did not want to go back into the White House.\nHe wouldn't ever, he said. The humiliations of working in Trump's admin-\nistration had almost destroyed Bannon’s satisfaction at having risen so\nmiraculously to the top of the world.\n\nSome, however, were not convinced by his protestations. They\nbelieved that Bannon actively fantasized that he would be brought back\ninto the West Wing to save Trump—and that, not incidentally, this would\n\nt\ni\nf\nj\nF\n|\n\nSIEGE 35\n\nbe his ultimate revenge on Trump, saving him yet again. Bannon certainly\nbelieved that he was the only one who could pull off this difficult rescue, a\nreflection of his conviction that he was the most gifted political strategist\nof his time, and of his view that Trump was surrounded by only greater\nand lesser lummoxes.\n\nTrump, Bannon believed, needed a wartime consigliere. And if, he\nmused, Jared and Ivanka were finally sent packing . . . But no, he insisted,\nnot even then.\n\nMoreover, Trump would not be able to tolerate it. Bannon under-\nstood that only Trump could save the day, or at least that Trump believed\nonly he could save the day. No other scenario was possible. He would\nrather lose, would rather even go to jail, than have to share victory with\nsomeone else. He was psychologically incapable of not being the focus of\nall attention.\n\nIn the end, it was easier and more productive to give Trump advice at\na distance than up close. It was a safer play to do what needed to be done\nwithout Trump himself actually being involved with, or even aware of,\nwhat was being done.\n\nThe morning Ryan announced his retirement from the House, Ban-\nnon was particularly eager to send some advice Trump's way. Setting up\na deft bank shot, he invited Robert Costa, a reporter for the Washington\nPost, to visit him at the Embassy.\n\nBannon spent a good part of every day talking to reporters. On some\ndays, perhaps most days, his blind-quote voice—hidden behind a famil-\niar attribution such as “this account is drawn from interviews with cur-\nrent and former officials’—crowded out most other voices on the subject\nof whatever new crisis was engulfing the Trump administration. These\nquotes functioned as something like a stage whisper that Trump could\npretend he didn’t hear. Trump, in fact, was always desperately seeking\nBannon’s advice, though only if there was the slightest pretext for believ-\ning that it came from some place other than Bannon. Indeed, Trump was\nquite willing to hear Bannon say something in this or that interview and\n\nthen claim he had thought of it himself.\n\nCosta sat at Bannon’s dining-room table for two hours, taking down\nBannon’s prescription for how to save Trump from himself.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021141",
