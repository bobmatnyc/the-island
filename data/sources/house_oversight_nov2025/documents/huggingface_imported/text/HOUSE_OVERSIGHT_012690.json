  "text": "Omar Quadhafi is hunkering down in Tripoli giving press interviews\ndenying that rebels are taking over Eastern Libya. Oil prices are\nshooting over one hundred dollars a barrel. The US government is on the\nverge of a shut down. These are not the top secret opening lines to\nAaron Sorkin’s new script, but the global headlines of a world spinning\nout of control. I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to\nattend the 83™ Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists\nthrust into combat.\n\nFor the second year nearly 6,00@ Academy members have nominated 10 films\nand the battle is down to two. The beloved timeless classic, \"The\nKing's Speech\" marches into the arena as the front runner, but\npassionate supporters of the brilliant edgier (and critics darling)\n\n\"The Social Network\" have not conceded. The ballots are counted, the\nparty invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Filmmakers are\nexhausted from campaigning.\n\nAt Bryan Lourd's famous star studded party Sony Classics’ Co-President\nMichael Barker announces to me he has taken a random sampling of voters\nin the room. He says, \"There will be a ‘Social Network' upset at the\nKodak Theater.\" Shear panic radiates from my every pore as he says, \"I\nam joking.\" It's like color war at summer camp.\n\nWoody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the\nAcademy because pitting artists against each other to determine the\nquality of their work is insane. They are right.\n\nMy event and publicity company is considered \"Switzerland\" by the\nstudios, as we help every filmmaker to present and position his work.\nThis year I am somewhat emotionally sucked in.\n\nIn 2005 I meet the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on\nhis first film for HBO,\"Elizabeth I\". The Emmy award winning movie stars\nHelen Mirren, who takes credit for discovering him directing English\ntelevision. Helen later wins her Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in\n“The Queen”. Queen Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI portrayed\nby Oscar winner Colin Firth in \"The King's Speech\".\n\nI also become Hooper's champion encouraging many to see his early work\nincluding his herculean 1@ hour HBO mini-series \"John Adams\" produced by\nTom Hanks.\n\nSix years later at the Telluride Film Festival Tom Hooper is bathing in\n\nthe glory of a hysterical standing ovation with Colin Firth and Geoffrey\nRush at the very first screening of \"The King's Speech.\" Surprisingly,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012690",
