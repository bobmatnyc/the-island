  "text": "The evolutionarily older systems also\nplay a role in human information\nprocessing and behavior, albeit in a more\nrigid and stereotyped fashion. The\nintricately interconnected neocortical\nregions of the frontal lobes are involved\nin self control, which permits the\nmodulation of these older systems and\nthe overriding of organismal hedonistic\nimpulses for the benefit of others (/5).\n\nEvidence across human history\nprovides overwhelming support for the\nsupposition that humans are\nfundamentally social creatures (/3).\nEven in contemporary times in which\nautonomy is revered, the average person\nhas been estimated to spend nearly 80%\nof waking hours in the company of\nothers, most of which is spent in small\ntalk with known individuals (/6). These\nestimates have been supported in more\ndetailed assessment using the day-\nreconstruction method to determine how\npeople spend their time and how they\nexperienced events in their lives on a\ndaily basis (17). The results of these\ndaily assessments indicate people spend\nonly 3.4 hrs alone, or approximately\n20% of their waking hours. The time\nspent with friends, relatives, spouse,\nchildren, clients, and coworkers is rated\non average as more inherently rewarding\nthan the time spent alone (/7).\n\nRespondents indicate that their\nmost enjoyable activities are intimate\nrelations and socializing — activities that\npromote bonding and high quality\nrelationships, whereas their least\nenjoyable activities are commuting and\nworking. These results are consistent\nwith survey data. When asked “what is\nnecessary for happiness?” the majority\nof respondents rate “relationships with\nfamily and friends” as most important\n(J8), although we certainly do not\nalways act like this is most important. It\n\nPage |23\n\nis surprisingly easy to overlook the\nevident.\n\nNoticing the Unusual, Overlooking the\nObvious\n\nOn January 15, 2009, US\nAirways Flight 1549 departed from New\nYork’s LaGuardia Airport for Charlotte,\nNorth Carolina when it struck a flock of\ngeese during takeoff. Both engines were\ndisabled, and the heavy aircraft quickly\nlost the power it needed to stay aloft, but\nCapt. Chesley Sullenberger somehow\nmanaged a controlled descent into the\nHudson River. The media dubbed the\nditching of the plane and the survival of\nall 155 passengers and crew the miracle\non the Hudson, and Sullenberger was\nduly heralded as a hero. The ability to\ncontrol the descent of an 84-ton plane\nwithout engine thrust is not something\nwith which humans are naturally\nendowed. Sullenberger was not a\nnovice, of course. He is a U.S. Air\nForce Academy graduate who flew F-4\nfighter planes while in the Air Force, has\n40 years of flight experience, and holds a\ncommercial glider license and glider\ninstructor rating. As remarkable as was\nhis achievement relative to what one\nmight normally expect in this situation,\nhowever, Sullenberger’s efforts were not\nsufficient for the miracle on the Hudson\nto be achieved.\n\nWhen Flight 1549 came to a stop\nin the frigid Hudson River, the\npassengers and crew scrambled to the\nwings and inflatable slides of their\nslowly sinking aircraft. Local\ncommercial vessels from the New York\nWaterway and Circle Line fleets\nresponded almost immediately, with the\nfirst of the vessels reaching the plane\nwithin four minutes. The crews of the\nvarious vessels worked together to\nrescue the passengers and crew of Flight\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021269",
