  "text": "A Child’ s Primer on Fighting Communism\n\nNow we are going to have some fun fighting Communism. Let us\n\nplay a game of Make Believe. Close your eyes and concentrate. We are\ngoing to pretend that Red China doesn’ t exist. They are the Bad Guys.\nBecause they make people slaves.\n\nNationalist China is different. They are the Good Guys. There,\nhundreds of thousands of little unwanted children are sold. They work in\ncoal mines. Then they are wanted. The older girls work in brothels. How\nnice to be so wanted. Open your eyes now. Anyone around our base is /¢.\n\nFidel Castro says Cuba is a socialist state. That proves they are\nCommunists. But we knew it before. You could tell by the way Castro and\nKhrushchev hugged each other. So we stopped buying sugar from Cuba.\nNow other countries buy sugar from Cuba.\n\nIran has bought 10,000 tons of sugar from Cuba. Iran gets a lot of\neconomic and military aid from us. So we are helping Cuba anyway. Maybe\nwe should trade tractors for prisoners then. But we will fool them. We will\n\nput treads on all the old Edsels that didn’ t sell.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015051",
