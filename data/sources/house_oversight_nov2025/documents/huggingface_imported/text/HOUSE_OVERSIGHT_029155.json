  "text": "FORGIVE ME FOR CONTINUING WITH PETER’S RESPONSE TO MY RESPONSE TO\nGORDON’S TWO POSTS.\n\n| HAVE LEARNED DIRECTLY FROM PETER BUT MORE OFTEN INDIRECTLY—HE\nHAS FORCED ME TO THINK THROUGH MATTERS AND IDENTIFY EXACTLY\nWHERE HE IS WRONG.\n\nTAM FINISHED WITH THAT NOW. LIFE IS SHORT AND MINE IS GETTING SHORTER\nBY THE DAY, SO | WILL REPEAT MY PIECE AND PETER’S RESPONSE TO IT (IN\nYELLOW) AND THEN MY CURRENT RESPONSE—IN CAPITAL LETTERS.\n\n1 AM ALSO ADDING TWO NAMES TO GORDON’S LIST. DAVID HAIG WHO IS A\nBRILLIANT EVOLUTIONARY GENETICIST AT HARVARD AND JEFFREY EPSTEIN\nWHOIS A BRILLIANT FUND AND INVESTMENT MANAGER (PALM BEACH, NYC, US\nVIRGIN ISLANDS) WITH BROAD SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS.\n\nDear Gruterites\n\nGordon has now brought the argument full circle and given the project a larger\nmeaning. The most powerful nation on earth, with the greatest power to vent\nharm—or, in theory, confer benefits—is ruled by an organism that fits the definition\nof a psychopath—of the narcissistic kind—or a malevolent narcissist. This presents\nserious dangers that need to be addressed.\n\nPeter Richerson has made several valuable points:\n\n1—Causality could go entirely in the other direction than the one |\nsuggested—people avoid more psychopathic relatives the more experience they\nhave had due to closer relatedness. And the paper | attached does not allow\ndiscrimination. The fact that psychopaths show only a weak and insignificant\ntendency to migrate further from place of birth is mildly interesting but has nothing\nto do with who is causing any difference in migration.\n\nAs far as I can think it through, selection pressures on psychopaths and relatives of\npsychopaths should be roughly equal and therefore equally likely. Peter is biased\ntoward reaction by others, perhaps because of his bias toward “cultural”\nexplanations. First, psychopaths always have the first move in the co-evolutionary\nstruggle and relatives getting out of the way is the next move. Secondly, it is very\neasy for a psychopath to simply discriminate against harming his relatives but\nharder for them to study and react. Peter claims that they are often spotted early in\nlife which I heartily doubt.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029155",
