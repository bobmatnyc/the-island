They also find that the\nunprecedented size and complexity of the penetration of NSA files,\ncompromising hundreds of thousands of secret documents pertain-\ning to U.S. operations against adversary nations, according to the\nNSA’s and the Pentagon’s estimates, is not easily explained given\nSnowden’s avowed purpose for his theft.\n\nThe deep split in how Snowden is perceived brings to mind the\nfamous drawing of a duck-rabbit cartoon first published in 1900 in\nthe book Fact and Fable in Psychology.
