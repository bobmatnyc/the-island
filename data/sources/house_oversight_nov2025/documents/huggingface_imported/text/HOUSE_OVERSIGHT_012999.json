Similar to our current research\ndirection with CogPrime, Joshua Blue was created with loose emulation of child cognitive\ndevelopment in mind; and, also similar to CogPrime, it features a number of cognitive processes\nacting on a common neural-symbolic knowledge store. The specific cognitive processes involved\nin Joshua Blue and CogPrime are not particularly similar, however. At time of writing (2012)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012999",
