And your Honor, even\n\ncriminal convictions are generally not admissible 10 years\n\nafter the fact. So presentation of this type of evidence is\n\nsimply nothing more than a smear campaign, which is prescribed\n\nby multiple Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nAnd finally, any marginal probative value of these bad\n\nacts as a child is vastly outweighed by the undue prejudice it\nwould cause Ms. Giuffre before a jury.\n\nYour Honor, now I'm turning to point number 12. We've\n\nasked the Court to exclud vidence relating to the tax\n\ncompliance of Ms. Giuffre's not-for-profit Victims Refuse\n\nSilence. Rule 401 is the first rule under which this should be\n\nexcluded. The alleged tax compliance of her not-for-profit\n\ndoes not go to whether or not defendant defamed Ms. Giuffre and\n\ndoes not go to whether or not defendant abused Ms. Giuffre.\n\nIt should also b xcluded under 403. It is highly\n\nprejudicial. It would give the wrong impression to the jury\nthat Ms. Giuffre's organization is not tax compliant, which, in\nfact, it is a fact that defendant does not acknowledge in her\nbriefing.\n\nProving whether or not Ms. Giuffre's not-for-profit is\n\ntax compliant would also be a mini trial and, frankly, a\n\nsideshow to this case.\n\nFurthermore, all of defendant's conclusions about\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011330",
