  "text": "206 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nIf humans used a formal system to think, they would be limited by\nthe incompleteness theorem and unable to discover new theorems that\nrequired them to extend the formal rules. Humans do not appear to have\nsuch a limitation and regularly extend their appreciation of mathematics\nby expanding the rules, and seeing through to the truth.\n\nMany scientists dislike this argument and think it farfetched, saying\nthere is no evidence to show people see past the limitation. Our brains\ncould be following a formal system capable of discovering everything we\nhave discovered to date or, indeed, might encounter in the future. Why\nshould we assume human minds are constrained in the same way as the\nmathematical systems they discover? There is no evidence to suggest a\nhuman thinking about Peano arithmetic is running a Peano based model\nin their head. When Peano discovered his theorem he was certainly\nextending our mathematical knowledge, but this does not imply he was\nextending the capability of his brain.\n\nThe critics of Lucas and Penrose have one big problem to deal with.\nThe formal system in our head would need to be able to see the truth in\neverything we could ever encounter. But, our formal system appears to\nbe small. As infants, it is almost nonexistent. Where does this enormous\nsystem come from? It can’t come from our parents because they have\nthe same problem; they were once children. You might argue that the\ncapability of the human brain is huge and we can learn from all the other\nhumans on earth, but let me remind you what Godel said. However large\n\nTwo Giants\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015896",
