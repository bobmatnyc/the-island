  "text": "for survival, for evolution. And it would best be done cooperatively with the nation\nthat will, in a short time, have the largest economy in the world.\n\nChina is not really a threat to the US now. The country can’t assemble the ability to\ndemolish or attack America in any significant way, and itis years from being able to\nsustain a military effort. It is not in China’s interest to provoke a match. They would\nlose. And honestly they have endless, troubling problems to handle, many new in\nhuman history. How do you care for 800 million aging people? Though China will\npass the US in total national income in coming years, the country may never pass\nAmerica in per-capita income. With an aging, 1.4 billion person population the\nchallenges of distribution nearly guarantee this. Time acts against both the United\nStates and China today. Each depends on global arrangements that are themselves\ncracking. Each nation needs to adjust her structures for a network world. But these\npressures operate severely against China. She can disrupt and challenge and slow\nthe transition to a gated order if she wishes, but only at the cost of fatal distraction.\n\nAn American Hard Gatekept system will thrive with or without China. China is not so\nfortunate. Her system, without America or other elements of global connection,\ncannot continue on the path of reform. Great network construction — this is the\nnature of our age. There is no fighting the nature of the age, as Huang Hua would\nremind us. We should of course expect China to build her own systems. We can also\nexpect that she will try to avoid some of the costs that joining an American system\nmight impose. That’s all fine. Our aim should remain constant, calm and direct: Build\na gatekept system for our own use; enforce the rules we believe secure that system.\nAnd remain clear in our thinking: The threat to the US is the evolution of the\nnetwork. The threat to China? The evolution of the network.\n\nIf an arrangement based on these undeniable facts seems unlikely, it is worth\nremembering that in the twenty years before the restablishment of simple relations\nbetween Beijing and Washington in 1971, the two sides had fought a war in Korea,\nbuilt a politics based on condemning one another, and drifted so far apart as to\nshare nearly no econoic connection. Bringing the countries together demanded\nheroic diplomacy on both sides, to be sure. To read the transcript of Henry Kissinger\nand Zhou Enlai’s first, secret meeting on July 9, 1971 is to regard a masterclass in\ncareful chessboard moves?®5. But the game itself demanded a clear view of the\nboard, of shared interest in the face of a changing world. On his very first day in\noffice, Nixon compiled a list of his diplomatic aims: “Chinese Communists: Short\nrange — no change. Long range - we do not want 800,000,000 living in angry\nisolation. We want contact.”25¢ The Seventh Sense returns us to this fundamental\nquestion of balance, but in a new frame. It alters how we look at the range of options\nfor US-China relations - and American security itself. There are certain problems\nboth sides face, perhaps the most essential, that are simply not addressable using\n\n255 To read the transcript: Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969-1976,\nVolume XVII, doc 139\n\n256 Nixon complied a list: Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969-1976, Volume\nXVII, doc 3, footnote 3\n\n184\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018416",
