  "text": "182 10 A Mind-World Correspondence Principle\n\nVia pursuing to the mind-world correspondence property in this context, I believe we will\nfind that world-paths reflecting successive refinement correspond to mind-paths embodying suc-\ncessive refinement. This will be found to relate to the hierarchical structures found so frequently\nin both the physical world and the human mind-brain. Hierarchical structures allow many rel-\nevant goals to be approached via successive refinement, which I believe is the ultimate reason\nwhy hierarchical structures are so common in the human mind-brain.\n\nAnother next step would be exploring what mind-world correspondence means for the struc-\nture and dynamics of a limited-resources intelligence. If an organism O has limited resources\nand, to be intelligent, needs to make\n\nP(o(O, M(A), t(7))]o(O, M(B), T))\n\nhigh for particular world state-sets A and B, then what’s the organism’s best approach?\nArguably, it should represent (/(A) and M(B) internally in such a way that very little compu-\ntational effort is required for it to transition between M(A) and M(B). For instance, this could\nbe done by coding its knowledge in such a way that 17(A) and M(B) share many common bits;\nor it could be done in other more complicated ways.\n\nIf, for instance, A is a subset of B, then it may prove beneficial for the organism to represent\nM(A) physically as a subset of its representation of M(B).\n\nPursuing this line of thinking, one could likely derive specific properties of an intelligent\norganism’s internal information-flow, from properties of the environment and goals with respect\nto which it’s supposed to be intelligent.\n\nThis would allow us to achieve the holy grail of intelligence theory as I understand it: given\na description of an environment and goals, to be able to derive an architectural description for\nan organism that will display a high level of intelligence relative to those goals, given limited\ncomputational resources.\n\nWhile this “holy grail” is obviously a far way off, what we’ve tried to do here is to outline a\nclear mathematical and conceptual direction for moving toward it.\n\n10.6 Conclusion\n\nThe Mind-World Correspondence Principle presented here — if in the vicinity of correctness —\nconstitutes a non-trivial step toward fleshing out the concept of a general theory of general\nintelligence. But obviously the theory is still rather abstract, and also not completely rigorous.\nThere’s a lot more work to be done.\n\nThe Mind-World Correspondence Principle as articulated above is not quite a formal math-\nematical statement. It would take a little work to put in all the needed quantifiers to formulate\nit as one, and it’s not clear the best way to do so the details would perhaps become clear in the\ncourse of trying to prove a version of it rigorously. One could interpret the ideas presented in\nthis chapter as a philosophical theory that hopes to be turned into a mathematical theory and\nto play a key role in a scientific theory.\n\nFor the time being, the main role to be served by these ideas is qualitative: to help us think\nabout concrete AGI designs like CogPrime in a sensible way. It’s important to understand what\nthe goal of a real-world AGI system needs to be: to achieve the ability to broadly learn and\ngeneralize, yes, but not with infinite capability rather with biases and patterns that are implicitly\nand/or explicitly tuned to certain broad classes of goals and environments.
