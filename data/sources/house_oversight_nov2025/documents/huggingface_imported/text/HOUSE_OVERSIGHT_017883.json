Jd. 19.\nMr. Al-Husani submits that Plaintiffs can-\nnot cure the lack of allegations in the\ncomplaint in its motion papers. Wright v.\nErnst & Young, LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 178\n(2d Cir.1998) (explaining a party is not\npermitted to amend its complaint through\nallegations made in motion papers).\n\nMr. Al-Husani also claims that he was\nnot properly served because The Interna-\ntional Herald Tribune has a circulation of\nonly 199 in Saudi Arabia and is published\nin English, and Al Quds Al Arabia is a\nLondon-based paper banned in the King-\ndom. Even if service was proper, howev-\ner, Mr. Al-Husani submits this Court does\nnot have personal jurisdiction over him.\n\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs claim that Mr.\nAl-Husani is also implicated by the “Gold-\nen Chain,” and thus an early supporter of\nal Qaeda. Plaintiffs’ Opp. to Al-Husani\nMotion to Dismiss at 10; Bierstein Aff. at\nEx. 2 (document listing “Hamad Al Husai-\nni,” without indicating when list was writ-\nten, by whom, or for what purpose). The\nPlaintiffs place great weight on the United\nStates’ inclusion of the “Golden Chain” in\nits proffer of evidence in United States v.\nArnaout, the government’s case against an\nexecutive of Defendant charity BIF. See\nBierstein Aff. at Ex. 1 (proffer). The\ncourt presiding over that case, however,\nruled that the document was inadmissible\nhearsay. United States v. Arnaout, No.\n02 Cr. 892, 2008 WL 255226, at *1-2\n(N.D.IIL Feb. 4, 2003). Nevertheless, by\nsupporting al Qaeda, Plaintiffs assert Mr.\nAl-Husani purposefully directed his activi-\nties toward the United States, making the\nexercise of personal jurisdiction appropri-\nate. See, eg. Bierstein Aff. Exs. 9-15\n(detailing al Qaeda’s hatred for and actions\nagainst the United States). Additionally,\nPlaintiffs claim that one of Mr. Al-Husa-\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nni’s companies is a supporter of Al-Waqf\nal-Islami Foundation, a Dutch entity whose\nseminars “have drilled extremist messages\ninto the heads of thousands of young Mus-\nlims.” “Radical Foundation: In ‘Law’\nSeminars, A Saudi Group Spreads Ex-\ntremism,” Wall St. J., Apr. 15, 2003, at\nBierstein Aff. Ex. 6.\n\n[64] Plaintiffs have not established a\nprima facie showing of jurisdiction over\nMr. Al-Husani to survive his motion to\ndismiss or warrant jurisdictional discovery.\nThe “Golden Chain” does not say what the\nPlaintiffs argue it says. It is only a list of\nnames found in a charity’s office. It does\nnot establish Mr. Aljomaih’s involvement\nin a terrorist conspiracy culminating in the\nSeptember 11 attacks and it does not dem-\nonstrate that he purposefully directed his\nactivities at the United States. According-\nly, Mr. Al-Husani’s motion to dismiss the\nBurnett complaint against him is granted.\n\n6. NCB\n\nThe Court outlined the Ashton and Bur-\nnett Plaintiffs’ claims against NCB in Part\nI.B.4. For purposes of the personal juris-\ndiction analysis, the Court will assume at\nthis point that the FSIA does not provide\nfor subject matter and personal jurisdic-\ntion over NCB. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs\nwill have to make a prima facie showing to\nsurvive NCB’s motion to dismiss. In that\nvein, Plaintiffs argue that NCB purpose-\nfully directed its activities at the United\nStates and participated in a conspiracy\nthat culminated in the attacks of Septem-\nber 11.\n\nPlaintiffs submit NCB has many con-\ntacts with the United States, including a\nwholly-owned subsidiary in New York City\nthrough which it operates an international\nbanking business. See, e.g., Aff. of John\nFawcett in Support of Ashton Plaintiffs’\nOpp. to NCB’s Motion to Dismiss (herein-\nafter “Fawcett Aff.”) 13, Exs. 2 & 3. NCB\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017883",
