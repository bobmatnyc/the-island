If he agrees, that\naction could spur a federal case that might expose Epstein to a\nlonger incarceration if convicted.\n\nAfter Palm Beach police received a complaint about Epstein in spring\n2005, more than 30 young women participated in civil lawsuits that\nalleged he lured them to his home for sexually charged rubdowns\nand/or sex in exchange for cash when they were minors. Some\ncases were dismissed, and others were settled.\n\nSle-mm-— )0g0ba- AsO\n8/19/2011\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021716",
