  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n799\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nproximate cause, and in tort law, a defen-\ndant will be held liable only for those\ninjuries that might have reasonably been\nanticipated as a natural consequence of the\ndefendant’s actions.” Jd. at 1012. Plain-\ntiffs submit the court’s decision in Bowm—\nthat the ATA was designed “to extend\nliability to all points along the causal chain\nof terrorism’—supports the finding that\nPrince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s conduct\ncaused the attacks on September 11, 2001.\nId. at 1011.\n\nPlaintiffs exert much effort outlining the\nconnections between al Qaeda and the De-\nfendant charities that Prince Sultan and\nPrince Turki supported. Plaintiffs argue\nthat the indirect nature of the Princes’\ncontributions to al Qaeda is not fatal to\ntheir claims since they allegedly knew that\nfunds they donated to the Defendant chari-\nties were being diverted to al Qaeda. See\nBierstein Aff. in Opp. to Prince Sultan’s\nMotion to Dismiss, Exs. 1-24. The Court\nhas reviewed the exhibits on which Plain-\ntiffs rely and finds only a handful relate to\nPlaintiffs’ arguments.\n\nExhibit 11 is a report allegedly prepared\nfor the President of the U.N. Security\nCouncil regarding a Saudi connection to\nterror financing. The report mentions\nPrince Sultan once in his role as the head\nof the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs\nand does not conclude or suggest that he\nhad any knowledge that charities to which\nhe allegedly donated were funneling mon-\ney to al Qaeda.\n\nExhibit 12 is a statement by the former\nFrench Minister of the Interior in which\nhe claims to have met with Prince Sultan,\nPrince Turki, and other members of the\nSaudi Royal family in November 1994 and\nto have raised the “question of financial aid\nfurnished by Saudi charitable organiza-\ntions enjoying state support ... to Islam-\nist movements or terrorist groups.” The\nonly charity he names in his statement is\n\nthe World Islamic League, not one of the\ncharities to which the Princes allegedly\ndonated.\n\nExhibits 21-24 are excerpts from The\nMuslim World regarding Prince Sultan’s\ndonations to IIRO and the Joint Saudi\nCommittee for Relief of Kosovar Refugees\n(“JSCR”). There is no indication in these\nexhibits that IIRO or JSCR was funneling\ndonations to al Qaeda. Even construing\nthese allegations and exhibits in the light\nmost favorable to Plaintiffs, and drawing\nall inferences in their favor, none of these\nexhibits amount to admissible evidence\nthat Prince Sultan or Prince Turki knew\nthe charities they supported were fronts\nfor al Qaeda.\n\nAlternatively, Plaintiffs argue that, since\nOsama bin Laden and al Qaeda made no\neffort to hide their hatred for the United\nStates, Prince Sultan and Prince Turki had\nto have been aware that the United States\nwas a target, making the atrocities of Sep-\ntember 11, 2001 a foreseeable result of\ntheir actions. See, e.g., Bierstein Aff. in\nOpp. to Prince Sultan’s Motion to Dismiss,\nExs. 2-10, 14, 15, 18, 20 Gincluding reports\nand fatwas summarizing Osama bin Lad-\nen’s and al Qaeda’s repeated public threats\nto and denouncement of the United\nStates). There is no question that in the\nyears leading up to the September 11 at-\ntacks, Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda were\nincreasingly vocal in their hatred of the\nUnited States and its interests. The ques-\ntion remains, however, whether Plaintiffs\nhave adequately alleged that Prince Sul-\ntan’s and Prince Turki’s specific acts aided\nand abetted those terrorists.\n\nBoth Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\nclaim Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate their\nalleged tortious activity caused Plaintiffs’\ninjuries. They argue that Plaintiffs ignore\nthat Osama bin Laden also targeted the\nSaudi Royal family. See, e.g., Bierstein\nAff. in Opp. to Prince Sultan’s Motion to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017864",
