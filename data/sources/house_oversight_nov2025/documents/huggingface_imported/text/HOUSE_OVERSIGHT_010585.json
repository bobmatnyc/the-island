See Jeff Epstein Sued for \"Repeated Sexual Assaults\" on Teen, New York\nPost, October —:17, 2007, by Dareh Gregorian, link at:\nhttp://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_44z]WyLUFH7R10OUtKY GPbP;jsessionid=6CA3\nEBF1BEF68F5DE14BFB2CAA5C37E0. See Article attached hereto as Exhibit “X”.\n\n51.  Edwards’s three complaints against Epstein contained less detail about sexual\nabuse than (as one example) a complaint filed by attorney Robert Josephsberg from the law firm\nof Podhurst Orseck. See Complaint, Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein (Exhibit “B”). As recounted in\ndetail in this Complaint, Jane Doe 102 was 15 years old when Ghislaine Maxwell discovered her\nand lured her to Epstein’s house. Maxwell and Epstein forced her to have sex with both of them\nand within weeks Maxwell and Epstein were flying her all over the world. According to the\nComplaint, Jane Doe 102 was forced to live as one of Epstein’s underage sex slaves for years\nand was forced to have sex with not only Maxwell and Epstein but also other politicians,\nbusinessmen, royalty, academicians, etc. She was even made to watch Epstein have sex with\nthree 12-year-old French girls that were sent to him for his birthday by a French citizen that is a\nfriend of Epstein’s. Luckily, Jane Doe 102 escaped to Australia to get away from Epstein and\nMaxwell’s sexual abuse.\n\n52. Edwards learned that in addition to civil suits that were filed in court against\nEpstein, at around the same time other attorneys engaged in pre-filing settlement discussions\nwith Epstein. Rather than face filed civil suits in these cases, Epstein paid money settlements to\nmore than 15 other women who had sexually abused while they were minors. See articles\n\nregarding settlements attached hereto as Composite Exhibit “Y.”\n, 20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010585",
