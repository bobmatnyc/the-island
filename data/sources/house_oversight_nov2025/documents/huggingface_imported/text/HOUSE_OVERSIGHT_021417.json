  "text": "to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public. | do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of\nyour reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself,\nthen in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it\nalso opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to\nrespond to. The fact that | have remained a professor in all Universities with which | have been associated, in good standing, and also\nan officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they\ntrust my behavior. | was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as\nthey have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time\nwith the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my integrity or suggest | have a history of harassment, that too is\n\nfalse. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts’, as a scientist | try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather\nthan allegations and innuendo. | also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me\nor have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions.\n\nThe items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers falsely and inaccurately to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006\nwhere we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were respectful\nand platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim\n\nbecause | know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university\naction. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because | decided | didn’t want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that | was\nharassing them? The second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The ‘female companion’ in this case is my wife, who can attest to\nthe fact that the claim is false, which is what | wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down.\n\nIt is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,\n\nRe item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me\nwith questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation | DID tell her she was different than the other students in her\n\nyear. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so | told her\nthat she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as | recall, | did ask her on one of these\noccasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. | asked, because as a faculty member | was interested in knowing what we could\ndo, if necessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from |\nwanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. | have gone back over emails from that period. | have\nnumerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which | usually had to turn down because | was busy, and on several\noccasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and | politely declined. | did let her accompany me off\ncampus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. | did and do have coffee and meals with\nstudents on campus, and | see nothing wrong with this. | try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. | was shocked\nwhen | later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no\ninappropriate interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended, she continued to\nemail me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for\nwhich | had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and | gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to\ndrop her off at her hotel, and | note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, | expressed that | would\npass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint | was shocked and\nconcerned. When | spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, | was\ntold that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed at that time to be called for, and that the young woman in question\nhad agreed to that. By that time | learned of the complaint | had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at\nASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations | had with\nmy colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because | was already in Arizona at the time | was asked\nnot to have any further interaction with the student | agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was\nbasically moot because | was not on campus. | was also told that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain\nconfidential, which |, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the\ncomplaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.\n\nRe item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never\nany allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and morever the outside complaints were in fact related\nspecifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual\nwho was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged\n\ntransgression. | was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both\nUniversities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the\nUniversity would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion\nthat it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU’s investigation, which took a full month found\nsignificant inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, | will quote from the ANU report. The initial\ncomplaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made\nin the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated\n\n\"It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident.”\nAfter the month-long investigation, during which | was told | was not to interact with anyone on campus (again moot because | was a\nhemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim\n\nand apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which | quote:\n\n\"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021417",
