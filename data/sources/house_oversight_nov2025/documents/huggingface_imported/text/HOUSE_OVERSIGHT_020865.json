Trends*\n\ne America is spending beyond its means, and the problem — with mounting\nlosses & increasing debt — is getting worse, not better\n\ne Healthcare spending and obesity are rising dramatically.\ne Education spending is growing slower than healthcare spending.\ne Defense spending is declining on relative basis.\n\ne More and more Americans are on the government payroll or receive\ngovernment subsidies for retirement income, medical care, housing, and\nfood.\n\ne Inequality of income and wealth is rising, and fewer Americans pay income\ntaxes to support USA Inc.\n\ne Government increasingly resorts to borrowing to fund rising spending\nlevels (primarily for entitlement programs)...\n\nNote: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of data points and trends. We did not\n\nchoose the most recent 40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent\n\nSignificant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969 and subsequently many metrics (like individual income and corporate\n\nKP profit as well as federal budget surplus / deficit and debt levels) were significantly off their ‘normal’ levels.\n(@E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | High Level Thoughts 48\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020865",
