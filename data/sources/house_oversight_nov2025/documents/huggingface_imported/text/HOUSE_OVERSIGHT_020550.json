  "text": "91\n\nin a DUI case in a suburb of Los Angeles, a popular WeChat channel reported that the\nmotorist was undocumented and had committed the act to extend his stay in the United\nStates.*” Zhang noted that another cause of concern was the fact that these WeChat\nchannels helped foster anxiety among first-generation Chinese. As with other Chinese\nimmigrants who rely on traditional Chinese-language media for information, the anti-\nAmerican hothouse created by WeChat’s “news channels” leads to a type of resentful pro-\n\nChinese nationalism that is ripe for exploitation by the Chinese government.\n\nWeChat may be no more slanted in its treatment of information than American media\nthat serve domestic political extremes, but there is no precedent for the situation\nWeChat has created: A vast and vital community of Americans gets most of its “news”\nfrom, and does most of its communicating via, a platform known to be censored by a\nforeign government that opposes free speech and has been named by the US National\n\nSecurity Strategy as the greatest long-term security challenge the nation faces.\n\nWestern Media\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has always recognized the usefulness of the overseas\nmedia (both in local languages and Chinese) as a means to get its message out. Foreign-\nand Chinese-language media have always served the cause of China’s revolution. For\nexample, in the 1930s, foreign journalist Edgar Snow sang the praises of the Chinese\nCommunist Party and specifically its chairman, Mao Zedong. The Party conducted a\ncampaign in the United States in the 1940s to turn the American public against the\nregime of Chiang Kai-shek and to soften criticism of China’s Communists. Organizations\nsuch as the Institute of Pacific Relations, which provided Americans with in-depth\ncoverage of Asia, were staffed by Communist agents and played an important role in\nfashioning public opinion on America’s relations with China. To be sure, these techniques\nwere not unique to the Chinese Communist Party. The government of Chiang Kai-shek\nand its “China lobby” also used the overseas press to serve its purposes. In the 1950s,\nthe KMT government conducted a campaign against pro-Communist newspapers in the\nUnited States, convincing the US government to shutter several pro-PRC outlets and expel\n\npro-PRC journalists.\n\nThe events of 1989 sparked a significant change in China’s foreign propaganda campaign.\nFollowing China’s crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing and other\ncities, China’s image sank to a low not seen by Chinese officials in decades.** China\nBooks and Periodicals, which had been operating in the United States since the 1950s,\n\nclosed its offices on Fifth Avenue in New York City.
