Indeed, Ms. Maxwell and\n\nthe plaintiff are not on the same footing in this case with\nregard to who put their reputation at issue, who is claiming\nemotional distress damages, and plaintiffs are in a much\ndifferent position than defendants when it comes to\ncross-examinations about these issues, particularly in\ndefamation cases, because as Ms. Menninger pointed out earlier,\n\nunder Rule 405, everything that impacts the plaintiff's\n\nreputation in the community, including the failure to follow\nlaws, is the subject of cross-examination. So the argument\nthat what is good for the goose is good for the gander ina\ndefamation case simply doesn't apply when you're talking about\ndamage issues and reputational issues.\n\nThank you, your Honor.\n\nMR. CASSELL: Could I just have 15 seconds, your\nHonor?\n\nTHE COURT: No.\n\nMR. CASSELL: All right. Thanks.\n\nTH\n\nGl\n\nCOURT : Next.\n\nMR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, we could next take up the\n\nissue relating to the police reports which I have as\ndefendant's motion in limine to exclude police reports and\n\nother inadmissible hearsay at 677, response at 747, and then\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011410",
