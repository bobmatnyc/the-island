  "text": "we equipped to marshal enough of our population to agree just yet. The sooner we learn, however, the less we\nwill suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those lessons.\n\nI have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, the language\nof “feeling s” had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of “action;” we would do terrible\nacts that would cause bad feelings in the enemy which would then serve to justify whatever response it made. It\nhad always been a question of the harsh insensitive acts Westerners do against Muslims and the resulting hurt,\nloss, shame etc. that Muslims experience. The Ground Zero Mosque incident, however, broke new ground\nbecause all of a sudden non-Muslims’ feelings became the focus and were cast as resulting from Muslim acts.\nAnother example was seen in how quickly the attempt to blame the Benghazi murders on the video about\nMohammad fell apart. Just as large corporations eventually learned to turn away from shakedown attempts from\nrace baiters, we are beginning to learn to demand symmetry through mirroring. A word of caution: When\nenablers change their behavior and demand symmetrical rules f or the addict, the latter typically initially erupts\nwith great resistance. This is a stage we must be prepared to tolerate and fully withstand as it creates the only\nreal chance for the addict to finally change. It is critical, therefore, that when we finally engage in mirroring that\nwe be prepared to see it through completion.\n\nFP: What if we fail to engage in our own Inner Jihad and the Control Factor stays firmly in place?\n\nSiegel: Critical to the Inner Jihad is the realization that our civilization is fragile; not to be taken for granted.\nOur demands for multi-culturalism and diversity have bumped heads with the simple paradox that tolerating the\nintolerant leads to extinction. Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the most crystalline version of asymmetry we\nhave accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST place the Koran above all law while in America, the\nConstitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad , founder of CAIR, reputedly said, “Islam isn’t in Amer ica to be\nequal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in America and Islam is the\nonly accepted religion on Earth.” Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the Control Factor constantly\nseeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be negotiated. Only one can survive\nnot because we have declared “war” but because our Islamic Enemy has. That is, perhaps, the lesson we will\nmost need to fully learn, one way or another. We will eventually hit a Turnaround Moment as a nation and\n\nif enough of us are not truly prepared to fight and continue to be controlled by our delusions, we will lose. If we\ntruly seek to win, it is better to get there sooner while we have advantages than later.\n\nFP: Bill Siegel, thank you for joining FrontPage Interview.\nAnd thank you for writing this superb and most important book.\n\nWe encourage all o f our readers to get their hands on The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True Threat\nand to read it!\n\nEditor’s note: To watch The Glazov Gang‘s recent discussion about the Muslim Brotherhood’s\ninfiltration of the United States and the Obama administration, see this week’s episode below:\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nFiled Under: Daily Mailer, FrontPage Tagged With: Denial, Islam, muslim brotherhood, Obama, Siegel, The Control Factor\n\n22\nrei Print This Post\n\nAbout Jamie Glazov\n\nJamie Glazov is Frontpage Magazine's editor.
