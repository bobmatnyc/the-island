In determining\nwhether these were discretionary func-\ntions, the Court must decide whether the\nactions involved an element of choice or\njudgment based on considerations of public\npolicy. See Callahan v. United States, 329\nF.Supp.2d 404, 408 (S.D.N.Y.2004) (inter-\npreting FTCA); Berkowitz v. United\nStates, 486 U.S. 531, 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954,\n100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988) (construing FTCA).\n\n[29,30] There can be little doubt that,\nas the chairman of the Supreme Council of\nIslamic Affairs, charged with making rec-\nommendations to the Council of Ministers\nregarding requests for aid from Islamic\norganizations located abroad, and as the\nhead of the Special Committee of the\nCouncil of Ministers, charged with decid-\ning which grants should be made to Islam-\nic charities, Prince Sultan’s decisions were\nmade at the planning level of government,\nKline, 685 F.Supp. at 392, and “grounded\nin social, economic, and political policy,”\nVarig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct.\n2755. Similarly, as the head of DGI,\nPrince Turki’s decisions regarding the\ntreatment of the Taliban and Osama bin\nLaden were judgments based on consider-\nations of public policy. See Callahan v.\nUnited States, 329 F.Supp.2d at 408; see\nalso Burnett If, 292 F.Supp.2d at 20-21\n({TJhis conclusion would be nearly self-\nevident: Prince Turki, as director of intel-\nligence, taking acts to protect Saudi Arabia\nfrom terrorism, and Prince Sultan, as\nchairman of the Supreme Council, making\nrecommendations to the Council of Minis-\nters about requests for assistance from\nIslamic organizations outside Saudi Arabia\nor, as head of the Special Committee, de-\nciding what disbursements should be made\n\n29. The consolidated complaints are Ashton,\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nto Islamic charitable organizations, were\nclearly making ‘decisions grounded in so-\ncial, economic, and political policy, ”)\n(quoting Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814,\n104 S.Ct. 2755).\n\nAccordingly, to the extent that Plaintiffs\nallege acts Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\nperformed in their official capacities,\nPrince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s motions\nto dismiss the certain consolidated com-\nplaints and the Federal complaint are\ngranted. The Court denies Plaintiffs’ re-\nquest for jurisdictional discovery because\nPlaintiffs have not presented any factual\nbasis for believing that discovery might\nreasonably be expected to result in evi-\ndence that would overcome the discretion-\nary function exception. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(5)(A) (exception not applicable to\n“any claim based upon the exercise or\nperformance or the failure to exercise or\nperform a discretionary function regard-\nless of whether the discretion be abused.”)\nThe Court will consider the appropriate-\nness of exercising personal jurisdiction\nover Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s\npersonal acts in Part II below.\n\nb.

As explained above, the\nonly possible applicable exception is the\ntorts exception under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(5).\n\n[31,32] The Federal Plaintiffs’ allega-\ntions arise “predominantly from miscon-\n\nBarrera, Burnett, Salvo, and Tremksy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017867",
