  "text": "Article 2.\n\nNYT\n\nEurope’s Contagion\n\nEditorial\n\nNovember 16, 2011 -- Two years of gross mismanagement of the\neuro-zone debt crisis have all too predictably produced a wider crisis\nof market confidence that now threatens the entire 17-nation euro\nzone. This week’s formation of new technocrat-led governments in\nGreece and Italy has not calmed fears. Practically every euro zone\ncountry is paying the price in higher interest costs and ebbing\neconomic growth.\n\nThe only country that isn’t suffering — yet — is Germany, whose\ncompetitive export-driven economy feeds on foreign demand and an\nexchange rate held down by its neighbors’ troubles. But all European\ncountries cannot be Germany and run net surpluses, especially if\nBerlin insists on policies that keep factories shuttered and workers\nunemployed.\n\nAnd German leaders are wrong if they think their country will remain\nunscathed as its major trading partners and neighbors unravel.\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been talking a more pro-\nEuropean line. But she is still insisting on growth-killing austerity as\nthe price for European bailouts and still blocking the European\nCentral Bank from printing more euros and acting as a lender of last\nresort.\n\nMrs. Merkel’s advisers insist that she is doing what the German\npeople want. That is not leadership. She needs to challenge her\nvoters’ simplistic stereotypes of southern European sloth and tell\nthem the truth: The real threat to Germany isn’t inflation; it is an\neconomic collapse across Europe. And Germany has a huge amount\nto lose from a fracturing of the European Union.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031947",
