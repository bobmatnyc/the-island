But my -- I want to make\nsure we are clear about this.\n\nAm I correct that the report itself never\nsays, Alan Dershowitz abused anyone?\n\nA. That is a correct statement, I believe.\n\nQ. And we won't -- and the report does\nreflect -- the conclusion of -- it reflects abuse of\nminors by Jeffrey Epstein, correct?\n\nA. Oh yes, oh yea. What it shows is forcible\nrape of underage girls, and not a, shall we say, one off\nsituation, but on something that is happening over,\nlet's say, this is roughly a six-month period, 180\ndays -- I mean, I think you know, they document roughly\nspeaking at least 180 sexual encounters give or take,\nand in fact, on some days, what they document in that\npolice report is abuse that is taking place not once,\nnot twice, but three times during the day in this\nmansion.\n\nAnd so I certainly agree with you, if it's\npossible, maybe my math is off here, 200 percent, that\nthis report documents repeated sexual abuse including\nforcible rape by one of the closest friends of\nMr. Dershowitz, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nQ. So it's your testimony that Mr. Epstein was\n\none of Professor Dershowitz's closest friends?\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021849",
