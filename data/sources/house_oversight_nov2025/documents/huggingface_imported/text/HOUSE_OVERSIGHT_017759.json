Rev. 835, *911\n\nwould cover such situations by allowing victims who are present at a hearing to be heard on issues \"directly\" affecting their\nrights.\n\n[#912]\n\nRule 44.1 - Discretionary Appointment of Counsel for Victim\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nThe court's discretionary authority to appoint counsel for a victim should be included in a new rule as follows:\nRule 44.1 Counsel for Victims.\n\nWhen the interests of justice require, the court may appoint counsel for a victim to assist the victim in exercising his or her\nrights.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nAn argument could be made that the CVRA guarantees crime victims the right to appointed counsel. After all, the CVRA\nguarantees victims the right to be \"treated with fairness\" and fairness can be understood as embracing the assistance of counsel.\n309 But on closer examination, it becomes clear that nothing in the CVRA directly mandates counsel for victims. As Senator\nKyl explained, \"This bill does not provide victims with a right to counsel but recognizes that a victim may enlist counsel on\ntheir own.\" 310\n\nWhile the CVRA does not require judges to appomt counsel for victims, nothing in it prevents judges from doing so in\nappropriate cases, particularly under prevailing case law demonstrating that federal courts have inherent authority to make such\nappointments. Because this authority may not be well known to judges (or to victims), the authority should be clearly laid out\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nA number of federal courts have recognized inherent judicial authority to appoint lawyers for indigent litigants in both civil and\ncriminal cases. 3!! While these cases do not directly involve [*913] appointment of counsel for crime victims, their principles\n\n309 Cf. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963) (discussing \"fairness\" to the defendant as a reason for recognizing a right to\nappointed counsel).\n\n310 150 Cong. Rec. S4268 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n\n311 See, e.g., Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 73 (1932) (holding, in a capital case, that courts have the power to appoint counsel and that\n\"attorneys are officers of the court, and are bound to render service when required by such an appointment\"); United States v. Bertoli, 994\nF.2d 1002, 1015-18 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that the court has inherent power to order defendant's retained law firm to remain as standby\ncounsel at a criminal trial when defendant elects to represent himself pro se); United States v. Accetturo, 842 F.2d 1408, 1412-16 (3d Cir.\n1988) (holding that courts have inherent power to appoint counsel during a criminal trial proceeding but that the power does not extend to\nappointing lawyers licensed in other states); United States v. Bowe, 698 F.2d 560, 566-67 (2d Cir. 1983) (noting that a court has inherent\nauthority to appoint counsel for an indigent witness who may incriminate herself during testimony in a criminal case); Williamson _v.\nVardeman, 674 F.2d 121], 1212-16 (8th Cir. 1982) (upholding a state court judge's appointment of pro bono counsel in criminal case as\nconstitutional although noting that forcing an attorney to advance his own funds may be unconstitutional); 7vler v. Lark, 472 F.2d 1077, 1079\n(8th Cir. 1973) (noting that in civil rights cases, \"representation of indigents upon court order has been a traditional obligation of the lawyer\nwhich he assumes when he becomes a member of the bar\"); Dolan v. United States, 351 F.2d 671, 672 (5th Cir. 1965) (holding, in a criminal\ncase, that lawyers implicitly consent to be appointed by courts pro bono when accepting a license to practice law); United States v. Dillon,\n346 F.2d 633, 635-36 (9th Cir. 1965) (holding, in a criminal case, that there is \"an obligation on the part of the legal profession to represent\nindigents upon court order, without compensation\"). But cf. Colbert v. Rickmon, 747 F. Supp. 518, 527 (W.D. Ark. 1990) (holding that courts\nhave no inherent power to order attorneys to represent indigent clients). See generally Jerry L. Anderson, Court-Appointed Counsel: The\nConstitutionality of Uncompensated Conscription, 3 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 503 (1989) (discussing the trend against requiring lawyers to take\nuncompensated court appointments); Bruce Andrew Green, Court Appointment of Attorneys in Civil Cases: The Constitutionality of\nUncompensated Legal Assistance, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 366 (1981) (discussing the constitutionality of pro bono court appointments); Judy E.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017759",
