  "text": "Real-Life Learning Projects Considered &9\n\nthere will be some text to read and some questions to answer to make\nsure that you have read the text. Personally, I doubt that one could\nlearn much about any of these subjects by oneself in 8 hours (or even\n8 days.) Clearly, they are teaching vocabulary and a few facts. Most of\nit will be forgotten.\n\nNow suppose the insurance industry had come to me and asked\nmy company to build a course that covered these topics. What would\nI say? (Apart from: Are you nuts?—not in 8 hours.)\n\nI would start by asking what is hard about insurance adjusting. At\nthe same time, I would have already assumed that this was basically a\ndiagnosis task.\n\nDiagnosis is a complex cognitive process that has three important\nparts. The most important part is the end result. All successful diagno-\nses result in an answer (cancer, stopped up sewer line, misfiring spark\nplug, paranoia, etc.). These results are taken from a list of acceptable\nanswers and typically are not in any way inventive. The second part\nis the case. A prototypical case for all possible results typically is com-\npared with the current case. A match determines the result. The third\npart is the evidence. To construct a case, one must gather evidence.\nWhen more than one prototypical case matches the situation, more\nevidence needs to be gathered in order to differentiate the cases that\nmight match. Doctors call this differential diagnosis.\n\nHow does one learn to do diagnosis? One must know the pro-\ntotypical case, which often takes years for one to acquire naturally\nthrough experience. One must know how to gather evidence, and\nwhat constitutes evidence, and one must know the possible set of re-\nsults. All of this takes a long time to learn. But the process itself is very\nmuch the same no matter what you are diagnosing. So, one question\nwe would ask was whether the students in the course had any experi-\nence diagnosing anything. It is easier to teach diagnosis to people who\nhave done it before even if the subject matter is different this time.\nAnother question we would ask is how much the students knew about\nthe basics of the subject matter since it is easier to teach diagnosis to\nthose who already know the subject matter.\n\nSo when I ask what is hard about insurance adjusting, I have a\ngood idea of what the answer may be. It is probably in one of these\nthree things. Is it difficult to learn all the kinds of cases that there are\nand what differentiates one from another? This depends on how many\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023815",
