  "text": "15\n\nrelinquishes occupied Lebanese and Syrian territories and dismantles\nit nuclear arsenal; cultural, political, and economic development of\nthe region; and equal rights of all people living on that land.\n\nThe new state will be diverse -- an amalgam of different nationalities\nand faiths, all with equal rights and opportunities. To the Abrahamic\nfaiths, historic Palestine is the Holy Land. The majority of the\nPalestinians see themselves as Arabs; as such, the new state should\nhave a special status in a more meaningful Arab League. The\nnationalistic feelings of the Jewish population that link them to fellow\nJews worldwide must be recognised and upheld. The Jewish\npopulation will, however, have to reject Zionism, a racist and\napartheid ideology based on 19th century European colonialist\nthinking which preyed on the Jewish national feelings long before the\nPalestinians became its victims.\n\nThe new state will bring fundamental changes in governance to the\nregion. Democracy based on equal opportunities will begin to take\nhold with economic and military unions of the independent states of\nthe region. An EU-like union of the new state, Syria, Jordan and\nLebanon will enhance peace and reconciliation and will be a nucleus\nfor a larger regional union.\n\nThere are numerous challenges ahead. They range from developing\ntrust to rebuilding the infrastructure, the judicial, educational and\nsocial institutions; from disposing of the nuclear arsenal to dealing\nwith the issues of confiscated lands, demolished homes and erased\ntowns and villages. The first step, however, is to go to the UN\nGeneral Assembly.\n\nProfessor Musa teaches global politics at the Ecole des Hautes\n\nEtudes Internationales in Paris, and Dr Sarrif is a researcher in\nMiddle East studies.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029946",
