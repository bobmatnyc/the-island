  "text": "Knowledge 143\n\nThe infinity library would contain every possible symphony, theorem,\nnovel, poem, and play ever written, or to be written. Its sister library\nnext door, the continuum library, would contain all the analogue works\nof art; painting, sculpture, architecture, physical artifacts and the like.\nThe curators of the two libraries would constantly argue over whose\ncollection was the better. We'll leave them to differ for the moment. The\ninfinity library is interesting enough so let's explore it first. After all, its\nsister, the continuum library, takes an infinite amount of time just to look\nat the first room, and we are in a hurry!\n\nAlthough the infinity library is infinite, we are probably only\nconcerned with entries shorter than a million symbols. All the interesting\npapers, proofs and symphonies I know of are shorter than this. If wanted\nto include all computer programs, I would still only need to increase it to\n100 million symbols. Looking for knowledge is not itself an infinite task.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I will ask the infinity librarian to organize\nthe collection. Any book or paper will be sorted according to its title and\nthe contents of its pages, and similar books should be grouped together.\nI also only want to look at the English section of the library for the\nmoment. I will still have a huge section to look through but at least every\nwork is titled and readable by me. Much of the information will be junk\nbut amongst the sea of rubbish will be islands of useful knowledge. Now,\nis there a way to find knowledge in this library in an automated fashion?\n\nBattleship\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015833",
