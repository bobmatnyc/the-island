  "text": "“Yes, it could,” he said.\n“What?” Rabin barked.\n\nGonn replied matter-of-factly: “It is a physical device. It obeys the laws of\nphysics. When, for instance, there’s a thunderstorm in Turkey, a flash of\nlightning could discharge at precisely the frequency needed, or one of its lower\nharmonies, with enough energy to activate the fuse in the detonator.”\n\nI was far junior to everyone else in the room. But as a physics student, I was\nprobably the only one who could fully follow the argument he was making.\nLooking at Rabin’s expression, it was clear that he was about to cancel the\noperation on the spot. “Excuse me, sir,” I said. “Could I ask Doctor Gonn\nanother question?”\n\nI pointed at an unopened bottle of orange soda on Rabin’s desk. “Tell me,” I\nasked the physicist, “is it possible that the fluid in that bottle is spontaneously\nleaking through the glass even as I’m speaking?”\n\n“Sure,” Gonn said. “It might take years before even a fraction of a centimeter\nof the soda goes missing. But glass is like a ‘frozen’ liquid, and liquid water, or\nthe molecules, are seeping into, and through, the more viscous ‘liquid’ of the\nglass. It’s just physics.”\n\nRabin looked at me, then at Gonn. But he had clearly got the message. “The\noperation is confirmed,” he said, in the deep, gravelly voice I would become\nmuch more familiar with in the years ahead. “Good luck.”\n\nThe device didn’t explode, but I couldn’t defuse it either. I did manage to get\nthe remote metal tool locked on the bolt on the booby trap. But it wouldn’t\nbudge — even when I waved back Nechamia and the others and took out an\nordinary wrench. Though this was the first of my sayeret missions that ended in\nfailure, that wasn’t what worried me as we boarded our helicopter back into\nIsrael a couple of hours before dawn. It was the real possibility that the\nEgyptians would inadvertently discover that we’d been intercepting their\ncommunications. Dovik Tamari, as sayeret commander, was especially upset.\nThis was one of the last operations during his period in command of the unit. He\nwas about to hand over to a veteran paratroop officer, Uzi Yairi.\n\nYet our aborted Sinai mission turned out not to matter. What saved our\neavesdropping network was the very thing which I was confident would not\nhappen when I left for university: another Arab-Israeli war.\n\n86\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027934",
