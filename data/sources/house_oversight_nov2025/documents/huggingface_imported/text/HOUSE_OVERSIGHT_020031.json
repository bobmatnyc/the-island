Indeed, the problem with Bannon’s $1.5 million a year Internetcentric Breitbart News\nwas that it couldn’t be monetized or scaled up in a big way, but with O’Reilly and Hannity\non board, there could be television riches fueled by, into the foreseeable future, a new\nTrump-inspired era of right-wing passion and hegemony.\n\nAiles’s message to his would-be protégé was plain: Not just the rise of Trump, but the\nfall of Fox could be Bannon’s moment.\n\nIn reply, Bannon let Ailes know that for now, he was trying to hold on to his position in\nthe White House. But yes, the opportunity was obvious.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nEven as O’Reilly’s fate was being debated by the Murdochs, Trump, understanding\nO’Reilly’s power and knowing how much O’Reilly’s audience overlapped with his own\nbase, had expressed his support and approval—‘“T don’t think Bill did anything wrong... .\nHe is a good person,” he told the New York Times.\n\nBut in fact a paradox of the new strength of conservative media was Trump himself.\nDuring the campaign, when it suited him, he had turned on Fox. If there were other media\nopportunities, he took them. (In the recent past, Republicans, particularly in the primary\nseason, paid careful obeisance to Fox over other media outlets.) Trump kept insisting that\nhe was bigger than just conservative media.\n\nIn the past month, Ailes, a frequent Trump caller and after-dinner adviser, had all but\nstopped speaking to the president, piqued by the constant reports that Trump was bad-\nmouthing him as he praised a newly attentive Murdoch, who had, before the election, only\never ridiculed Trump.\n\n“Men who demand the most loyalty tend to be the least loyal pricks,” noted a sardonic\nAiles (a man who himself demanded lots of loyalty).\n\nThe conundrum was that conservative media saw Trump as its creature, while Trump\nsaw himself as a star, a vaunted and valued product of all media, one climbing ever higher.\nIt was a cult of personality, and he was the personality. He was the most famous man in\nthe world. Everybody loved him—or ought to.\n\nOn Trump’s part this was, arguably, something of a large misunderstanding about the\nnature of conservative media. He clearly did not understand that what conservative media\nelevated, liberal media would necessarily take down. Trump, goaded by Bannon, would\ncontinue to do the things that would delight conservative media and incur the wrath of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020031",
