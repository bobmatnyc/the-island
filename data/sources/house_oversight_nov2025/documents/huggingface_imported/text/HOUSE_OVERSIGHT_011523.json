  "text": "first 25 miles will be familiar territory.” He left unspoken the obvious\npostscript: the need to negotiate the final five to ten miles, through open desert,\nand to find the right area, on our side of a border that wasn’t even marked.\n“Can’t any of you,” he barked, “lead a convoy of a few dozen trucks?”\n\nI’m not sure what possessed me. But I thought to myself: yes, I probably\ncan. I had been scouting and navigating in one way or another since those first\nevenings with Yigal in the kibbutz orchards. I’d trained with Gadna Sayerim.\nAnd while I’d never lived in the south, the farm settlement of Patish, where I’d\nworked along with Yigal after getting kicked out of high school, was not far\nfrom the route the conveys would have to take.\n\nSo I raised my hand.\n“Can you lead a convoy?” he asked.\n“Yes, sir,” I said. “Of course, Pll need a map. And a compass.”\n\n“Why do you think you’re qualified?” he prodded.

I was in the lead truck.\nThe driver was a reservist in his mid-30s. So were most of the men in the rest of\nthe transport trucks, one driver and one soldier in each. A staff sergeant, in the\nsecond vehicle, was in theoretical command. But, surreal though it felt, I was\nactually in charge, since I was the only person who might, conceivably, get us\nto the right place.\n\nThe platoon commander was right. The first part, on paved roads, was fairly\neasy.
