[Vol. 104\n\nManson case>.”!?”7 Thus, Black’s Law Dictionary does not help resolve the\ndispute as to which of the two meanings should be used, as there are clearly\ndiffering meanings. While OLC’s reading may be a permissible one, so is a\npro-victim reading.\n\nOLC also tums to the CVRA’s legislative history to bolster its\nconclusion. But, here again, its analysis is misleading. OLC relies on a\npassage from Senate floor colloquy between Senators Jon Kyl and Dianne\nFeinstein regarding the CVRA’s scope. In OLC’s recounting of the\nlegislative history, the floor statements “emphasize that the nght to confer\nrelates to the conduct of criminal proceedings after the filing of charges.”!78\nFor instance, OLC quotes Senator Kyl stating that “[u|nder this provision,\nvictims are able to confer with the Government’s attorney about\nproceedings after charging.”'*°\n\nThis is a truncated and deceptive description of the legislative history,\nso much so that Senator Kyl sent an angry letter to Attorney General Eric\nHolder complaining about the distortion. On June 6, 2011, the Senator\nwrote to “express [his] surprise that [OLC is] so clearly quoting [his]\nremarks out of context.” Senator Kyl then went on to observe that the\ncolloquy began by noting that the nght to confer “is intended to be\nexpansive.”'*! The Senator further discussed various “examples” of when\nthe right to confer applied, including “any critical stage or disposition of the\ncase. The right, however, is not limited to these examples.”'*? It was\nagainst that backdrop that Senator Kyl gave the example of conferring\nabout proceedings “after charging.”\n\nIn his letter to Attommey General Holder, Senator Kyl also noted that he\n\nhad:\nmade clear that crime victims had rights under the CVRA even before an indictment is\nfiled. For example, ... I made clear that crime victims had a right to consult about\n\nboth ‘the case’ and ‘case proceedings’—1.e., both about how the case was being\nhandled before being filed in court and then later how the case was being handled in\ncourt ‘proceedings.’ !?3\n\nSenator Kyl further commented that he had discussed the CVRA’s potential\napplication in grand jury proceedings, an application that required the Act\n\n7 BLACK’s LAW DICTIONARY, supra note 59, at 244.\n\n°8 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 9.\n\n°° Td.
