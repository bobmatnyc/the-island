Dershowitz’s false statements directly stated and also implied that in speaking out\nagainst sex trafficking Roberts acted with fraud, dishonesty, and unfitness for the task.\nDershowitz’s false statements directly and indirectly assert that Roberts lied about being sexually\ntrafficked and abused by Epstein and having sex with Dershowitz, and that Roberts committed\nthe crimes of perjury and extortion. Dershowitz’s false statements were reasonably understood\nby many persons who read his statements as conveying that specific intention and meaning.\n\n96.

Dershowitz made his\nfalse statements on behalf of himself and Epstein wantonly and with the specific intent to\n\nmaliciously damage Roberts’s good name and reputation in a way that would destroy her efforts\n\n26\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017960",
