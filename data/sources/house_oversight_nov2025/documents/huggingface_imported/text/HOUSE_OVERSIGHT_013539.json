  "text": "ultimately, the NFL draft. Choices obviously involved more than height, weight, time\nin the 40-yard dash and performance in motor coordination tasks. The players\nbehavior, carefully studied on the field, in multiple camera angle game films, direct\nand collateral interviews and observations under game conditions constituted a high\nlevel of selective pressure that brought with it the emergence of characteristic\npersonality types. Tens to hundreds of thousands of candidates are winnowed down\nto several hundred highly paid players in this selective process.\n\nDistinctive personality patterns accompany success at a particular position.\nStructure loving, politically more conservative, choreographed in detail and\nrepeatedly rehearsed, offensive players keep their lockers more organized and tidy.\nMore rebellious, resentful of structure, politically more libertarian, thematically\ninstructed but principally opportunistic, defensive players, particularly linemen and\nlinebacker’s lockers had messy lockers. Defensive team players were most often in\ntrouble with the law. Offensive lineman including centers, guards, tackles and some\ntight ends tend to be patiently enduring and tenacious, their aggression taking the\nform of stubbornness. This contrasts with the temperamental explosiveness of the\ndefensive line and linebackers. We could speak of the volubility of centers, the loyal\nand caring kindness of offensive tackles, the narcissistic exhibitionism of wide\nreceivers, the murderous rage of the defensive end, the sullen and paranoid\ndepressiveness of the defensive back, the joyfully impulsive unpredictability of\nbroken field running backs and the good citizenship egolessness of the blocking\nfullback. Some quarterbacks lead and play fearlessly in a religious state of grace,\nsome are members of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Others lead as\nfearlessly, but in the style of an unconscionably calm psychopathic bank robbing\nprofessional.\n\nInfluenced by our findings, the San Diego Chargers drafted the Hall of Fame\nquarterback and one time ABC Monday Night Football commentator, Dan Fouts.\nSkinny and hurt several times during his college years as a quarterback in Oregon,\nhe was passed over in the NFL draft until the third round. The scouts “knock” on him\nwas that they thought that he lacked psychological and physical toughness; the\n\nability to get up after a hit and to ignore the on coming tons of defensive linemen\n\n39\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013539",
