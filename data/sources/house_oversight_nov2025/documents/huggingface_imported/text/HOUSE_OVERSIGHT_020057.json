  "text": "The president and his son-in-law could barely contain their confidence and enthusiasm.\nThey felt certain that they had set out on the road to peace in the Middle East—and in this,\nthey were much like a number of other administrations that had come before them.\n\nTrump was effusive in his praise for Kushner. “Jared’s gotten the Arabs totally on our\nside. Done deal,” he assured one of his after-dinner callers before leaving on the trip. “It’s\ngoing to be beautiful.”\n\n“He believed,” said the caller, “that this trip could pull it out, like a twist in a bad\nmovie.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nOn the empty roads of Riyadh, the presidential motorcade passed billboards with pictures\nof Trump and the Saudi king (MBS’s eighty-one-year-old father) with the legend\nTOGETHER WE PREVAIL.\n\nIn part, the president’s enthusiasm seemed to be born out of—or perhaps had caused—\na substantial exaggeration of what had actually been agreed to during the negotiations\nahead of the trip. In the days before his departure, he was telling people that the Saudis\nwere going to finance an entirely new military presence in the kingdom, supplanting and\neven replacing the U.S. command headquarters in Qatar. And there would be “the biggest\nbreakthrough in Israel-Palestine negotiations ever.” It would be “the game changer, major\nlike has never been seen.”\n\nIn truth, his version of what would be accomplished was a quantum leap beyond what\nwas actually agreed, but that did not seem to alter his feelings of zeal and delight.\n\nThe Saudis would immediately buy $110 billion’s worth of American arms, and a total\nof $350 billion over ten years. “Hundreds of billions of dollars of investments into the\nUnited States and jobs, jobs, jobs,” declared the president. Plus, the Americans and the\nSaudis would together “counter violent extremist messaging, disrupt financing of\nterrorism, and advance defense cooperation.” And they would establish a center in Riyadh\nto fight extremism. And if this was not exactly peace in the Middle East, the president,\naccording to the secretary of state, “feels like there’s a moment in time here. The\npresident’s going to talk with Netanyahu about the process going forward. He’s going to\nbe talking to President Abbas about what he feels is necessary for the Palestinians to be\nsuccessful.”\n\nIt was all a Trumpian big deal. Meanwhile, the First Family—POTUS, FLOTUS, and\nJared and Ivanka—were ferried around in gold golf carts, and the Saudis threw a $75\nmillion party in Trump’s honor, with Trump getting to sit on a thronelike chair. (The\npresident, while receiving an honor from the Saudi king, appeared in a photograph to have\nbowed, arousing some right-wing ire.)\n\nFifty Arab and Muslim nations were summoned by the Saudis to pay the president\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020057",
