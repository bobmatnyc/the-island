I got on the airplane Saturday night and opened up the Palm Beach newspaper and\nhere’s what I found (see attached). Remember “Bear”, Warren’s friend from NY. Well, he is a Billionaire\n(Literally and really) and always seems to be in the news in South Florida. He competes with Trump on big\nproperty deals and seems to be quite the womanizer. The only problem is he goes after some of the young ones\n\nsometimes and must not check there ID’s.\n\nOh well, I thought you might get a kick out of this article. What a small world.\n\nTake good care!!\n\nDoug\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029858",
