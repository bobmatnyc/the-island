  "text": "\"Greenspan is someone | know and like,\" Keating says. “But if you are so naive to believe that institutions with a\nbalance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident waiting to happen then you don't deserve to be\nchairman of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nHe praises Obama for seeking a return to the “liberal internationalism\" that, in Keating's view, made the US great in\nthe post-World War Il age. This is the US he loves but it is still in retreat.\n\nAsked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: \"| believe there is a poetic strand to\nlife that doesn't exist in an economics textbook.\n\n\"This is not to say that rationalism isn't important and good. It is. But left to itself without the guidance of higher\nmeaning and a higher concept, rationalism can be mean and incomplete. | say if you simply live on rational policy\n\nand briefing notes you are not sufficiently informed.\n\n\"You need a higher calling or some inner system of belief - here | mention Kant and the inner command that tells\nyou what is true, what is right, what is good. The inner command must be the divining construct in what you do.\n\n\"Music has always been a large part of what makes me tick. You listen to a great work . . . you hear the majesty of\nthese works and your head and soul gets caught up in them. When that happens you are in for bigger things and\n\nyou will strike out to be better.\n\n\"When | was listening to music | would always have the pad out to write the ideas down.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029557",
