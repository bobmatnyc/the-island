In 2011 Counsel for Edwards wrote Dershowitz:\n(a) On August 23, 2011: “We... have reason to believe that you have\npersonally observed Jeffrey Epstein in the presence of underage females”.\n(b) On September 7, 2011: “Multiple individuals have placed you in the\npresence of Jeffrey Epstein on multiple occasions and in various locations when\nJeffrey Epstein was in the company of underage females subsequently identified\nas victims of Mr. Epstein’s criminal molestations.”\n65. Dershowitz lied and stated that he had never flown on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane\nwith a young woman and always flew with his wife. (Hala Gorani, CNN Live, Jan. 5, 2015).\nHowever, even the limited publically available flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane\ndemonstrate that Dershowitz flew often on Epstein’s planes without his wife; with young\nwomen, including a Victoria’s Secret model; Epstein’s procurer Ghislaine Maxwell; and Sarah\nKellen who was identified by the Government as Epstein’s co-conspirator in his sex trafficking.\n66. Dershowitz also lied by saying that he “never” got a massage from anybody: “I\nnever got a massage from anybody. It’s made up out of whole cloth.” (NY Daily News, January\n21, 2015). However, after it was revealed that Epstein’s household staff identified Dershowitz as\none of the recipients of “massages” at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion, Dershowitz changed his\nstory and admitted he got a massage at Epstein’s Palm Beach home but claimed: “I kept my\n\nunderwear on during the massage.” (Local 10, January 22, 2015).\n\n17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017951",
