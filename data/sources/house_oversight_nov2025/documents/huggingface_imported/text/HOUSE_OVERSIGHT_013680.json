  "text": "experienced, seek and think | know about, Thom was not after the logical proofs of\ngeometry but rather viewed mathematical theorem and proof work as activity\nderived from intuitive experience with geometric relations as the thought forms that\nrepresented rea/ Reality. Though a Field’s Medal winner in mathematics (recall that\nit is the Nobel Prize in mathematics awarded every four years at the International\nCongress of Mathematics) and for his life time, one of the most brilliant and fecund\nmathematicians in the world, so many mathematicians admit that they got the seeds\nof their life work from his throw away remarks, Thom, with a little smile and his eyes\ntwinkling, admitted to me with apparent pleasure that “| have never proven any\ntheorem in my life.” All his discoveries came from insightful moments of grace and\nthe courage to pursue them. Riding back from Paris late one night on a train that\ndidn’t stop at /HES’s town of Bures sur Yvette, | watched him use the red\nemergency phone to call the train’s engineer to stop the train suddenly for our exit. |\nloved him, in part, because he had the courage to believe in and act on my kind of\nintuitively realizable, experiential God.\n\nIn keeping with his characteristic style of generalizing mathematical systems\nbeyond their carefully defined specifics, Thom defined the concept of singularity\nvery broadly, speaking of them as distinctive and noteworthy things, points where\nthe usual or expected properties, laws and definitions fail, where smooth and\ncontinuous processes become discontinuous. For Thom, these were the settings for\nthe unexpected and miraculous. He believed that his work and that of many others,\nnow and in the future, would indicate that the set of miraculous singularities were\nfinite, systematic, universal and describable. Most importantly for our purposes,\nThom believed them to be archetypal. It was through the structure of archetypal\nsingularities that he regarded inside and outside realities as mutually reflective.\n\n| was blessed by hours of discussion with him during his car travels to\nlecture around France. Thom often asked me to accompany him as he drove from\nIHES to various branches of the University of Paris. He used these times to\nexercise my geometrically flavored, mathematical intuitions. He used words to\ncreate visualizable structures without the diagrammatic aid of a blackboard. He\n\nused mental topological structures created by the properties of imagined motions,\n\n180\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013680",
