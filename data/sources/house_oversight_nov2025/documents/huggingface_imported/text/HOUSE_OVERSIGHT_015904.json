  "text": "214 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nCodes\n\nEveryone has played with some sort of\nsecret code as a child — the Aggy Waggy\ngame, passing notes written in invisible\nink made from lemon juice, or perhaps\na simple cypher. If I want to send you a\nsecret message, I can use a substitution\ncode. Let’s see how good a code breaker\nyou are. Can you decode this?\n\nGdkkn Qdzcdq\n\nIt’s really easy. You might guess the\nmessage from the pattern of letters and\nyour knowledge of my writing style. There are a couple of interesting\npatterns to note: the 3“ and 4\" letter of the first word are the same and\nthe first and last letter of the second word are the same. As a test I gave\nthis code to my wife and my eight-year-old daughter to see how long it\ntook them to decode... Less than a minute for my wife — a linguist. We\nwill come back to my daughter shortly!\n\nRoman Emperors used this sort of simple code to secure their\nmessages, but modern codes have to be a great deal more sophisticated.\nLet us use a progressive cipher where we vary the substitution using a\nsecret word. Take the name of my dog and write it down repeatedly next\nto the letters of the message you want to keep secret. Now translate all\nthe letters in the message and the code into numbers ‘a = 1, ‘b = 2 and\nso on. Then add the letters of my dog’s name to the letters of the message\none at a time. If I get to 26 (‘z’) just wrap around to ‘a and carry on. This\nis called modulo arithmetic. This coding scheme will translate T to ‘a the\nfirst time but ‘T to ‘c the second making it much harder for a linguist to\nsee any pattern.\n\nEnigma Machine\n\nhello reader can you read this code\ngeorgegeorgegeorgegeorgegeorgegeorge\n\nGives\n\nojacveyjpvlwghpegcvzoilfkehzpxghcvle\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015904",
