Hoffman et al.\nConclusion\n\nIn this chapter we have showed that a single approach—game theory, with the help\nof evolution and learning—can explain many of our moral intuitions and ideologies.\nWe now discuss two implications.\n\nGroup Selection. Our chapter relates to the debate on group selection, whereby\ngroup level competition and reproduction is supposed to occasionally cause indi-\nviduals to evolve to sacrifice their own payoffs to benefit the group (e.g., Wilson,\n2006). One of the primary pieces of evidence cited in support of group selection is\nthe existence of human cooperation and morality (Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003; Fehr,\nFischbacher, & Gichter, 2002; Gintis, Bowles, Boyd, & Fehr, 2003; Haidt, 2012;\nWilson, 2010, 2012), in particular: giving in one-shot anonymous laboratory experi-\nments, intuitively sacrificing one’s life for the group Gumping on the grenade), and\ncontributions to public goods or charity. However, we have reviewed an alternative\nexplanation for these phenomena that does not rest on group selection. It also yields\npredictions about these phenomena that group selection does not, such as that peo-\nple are more likely to cooperate when they are being observed and there is variance\nin the cost of cooperation. The approach described here also explains other phenom-\nena, such as categorical norms and ineffective altruism. These lead to social welfare\nlosses, which is suboptimal from the group’s perspective. The categorical norm\nagainst murder, for example, leads to enormous waste when keeping alive, some-\ntimes for years, those who have virtually no chance of a future productive life.\n\nAdmittedly, despite their inefficiencies, these moral intuitions do not rule out\ngroup selection, since group selection can be weak relative to individual selection.\nBut it does provide a powerful argument that group selection is unnecessary for\nexplaining many interesting aspects of human morality. It also suggests that group\nselection is, indeed, at most, weak. One example that makes this especially clear is\ndiscrete norms. Recall that we argued that continuous norms are not sustainable\nbecause individuals benefit by deviating around the threshold. Notice that this ben-\nefit is small, since the likelihood that signals are right around the threshold is low.\nGroup selection could easily overwhelm the benefit one would get from deviating\nfrom this Nash equilibrium, suggesting group selection is weak (i.e. there are few\ngroup-level reproductive events, high migration rates, high rates of “mutation” in\nthe form of experimentation among individuals, etc.).\n\nLogical Justification of Moral Intuitions. In each of the applications above, we\nexplained moral intuitions without referring to existing a priori logical justifications\nby philosophers or others. Our explanation for our sense of rights does not rely on\nLocke’s “state of nature.” No argument we gave rests on God as an orderly designer,\non Platonic ideals, on Kant’s concepts of autonomy and humanity, etc. What does\nthis mean for these a priori justifications? It suggests that they are not the source of\nour morality and are, instead, post hoc justifications of our intuitions (Haidt, 2012).\n\nTo see what we mean, consider the following analogy. One might wonder why\nwe find paintings and sculptures of voluptuous women beautiful. Before the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015524",
