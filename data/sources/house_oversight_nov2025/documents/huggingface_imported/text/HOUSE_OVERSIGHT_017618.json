L. & Criminology 59, *80\n\nthat \"most courts ... have declined to extend enforceable rights under the CVRA to alleged victims of conduct that did not lead\nto criminal proceedings.\" !!> All the courts that have actually reached the issue have concluded exactly the opposite. !!°\n\nB. OLC'S DISTORTION OF THE CVRA'S STRUCTURE AND LEGISLATIVE HISTORY\n\nThe next section of OLC’s memorandum maintains that the CVRA's structure and legislative history lead to the conclusion that\nthe CVRA is \"best understood\" as extending rights after charges have been filed. Here again, OLC's analysis is truncated at best\nand misleading at worst.\n\nOLC begins this part of its analysis by observing that some of the rights in the CVRA are limited to court proceedings. OLC\nnotes, for example, that the CVRA gives victims the \"right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding ... involving the crime.\" !!7 But the fact that some of the rights listed in the CVRA apply to court proceedings\nhardly means that all of the rights are to be so restricted. The federal criminal justice process includes stages that are pre-\ncharging, post-charging, and post-conviction. It would hardly be surprising to find that a statute that Congress intended to be\n\nn 118\n\n\"broad and encompassing covered events occurring after the filing of charges.\n\nIndeed, OLC appears to recognize that at least three of the rights listed in the CVRA could easily apply before charges are filed:\n(1) the \"right to be reasonably protected from the accused\"; (2) the \"reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the\nGovernment in the case\"; and (3) the \"right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\"\n119 None of these rights explicitly refer to court \"proceedings\" or other events (such as parole hearings) that necessarily occur\nafter the filing of formal charges. !7°\n\n[*81] For purposes of this Article, it is appropriate to focus on the last two of these three rights: the right to confer and the\nright to fair treatment. The first of these three rights - the right to be reasonably protected - is already clearly extended by\nanother statute to crime victims before the filing of charges. While OLC does not acknowledge this fact, the VRRA extends the\nfirst right to crime victims, directing that a \"responsible official shall arrange for a victim to receive reasonable protection from\na suspected offender and persons acting in concert with or at the behest of the suspected offender.\" !7! Because a \"suspected\"\noffender obviously exists before the filing of criminal charges, the VRRA envisions the right to protection being provided as\nsoon as is practical after a victim suffers from the commission of a crime. Additionally, the sections of the Attorney General\nGuidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance addressing the VRRA direct that Justice Department components must provide\nreasonable protection even before the filing of criminal charges. !?* So, under the VRRA, the Justice Department should\n\n> OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 5-6. Notably, the Department does not embrace the language from Huff found within the\nSkinner and Paletz decisions because presumably such an approach would be contrary to many of the rights found in the CVRA.\n\n® See infra Part I.C.\n\n7 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6 (emphasis added) (quoting /8 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(2)).\n8 150 Cong. Rec. 7295 (2004) (statement of Sen. Dianne Feinstein).\n\n° OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 7-8, 10 (quoting 78 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(1), (5), (8)).\n\n20 OLC appears to have overlooked another right that could well apply before charges are filed: the right to be notified of one's rights under\nthe CVRA. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (requiring prosecutors to \"make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights described in [the CVRA]\"); United States v. Rubin, 558 F. Supp. 2d 411, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (discussing potential\napplication of the right to notification of rights before charges are filed). For purposes of this Article, it is not necessary to explore this right\nin detail. If other CVRA rights apply before charges are filed, a fortiori this right does as well. If a victim has a right, presumably the victim\nshould be notified of the existence of that right.\n\nPL 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(2) (2006) (emphasis added).\n222 See Attorney General Guidelines, supra note 52, at 7-8, 26-28.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017618",
