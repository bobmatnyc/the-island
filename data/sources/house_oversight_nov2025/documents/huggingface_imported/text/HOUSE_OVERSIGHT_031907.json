  "text": "32\n\nBut the idea of liberal democracy — the U.S. is not the only exemplar\nof liberal democracy — [remains]. It’s a powerful idea that would\nexist independently of whether the U.S. is hegemonic or not.\n\nI’m not as scared of a world without American hegemony as some\npeople are. We went through the whole Cold War period in which the\nU.S. was one of two superpowers. A return to a more multi-polar\nworld in certain ways induces a fair amount of moderation among big\nplayers in the system, because people know they can’t get their way\nunilaterally. And in the more multi-polar world we’d probably think\ntwice about doing things like Iraq. The more important question is: In\nthe global marketplace of ideas, how dominant will American ideas\nabout freedom and rule of law and democracy and our economic\nmodel be? Our ideas will obviously be challenged; and it’s important\nfor the U.S. to put its own house in order, both politically and\neconomically, because that’s the most important way we exercise\ninfluence around the world: The model we set.\n\nSHAFFER: To revisit Our Posthuman Future, are there any\ndevelopments in bio-technologies in the past nine years that you find\nparticularly disturbing?\n\nFUKUYAMA: Yes. The whole rise of synthetic biology, where\n\nwe ve had new forms of life, and the ability to do new forms of life is\nproceeding extremely rapidly. The creation of an artificial bacteria\nitself is not immediately threatening, but it’s part of a long-term\nprocess by which we’ll uncover the technologies for manufacturing\nlife, in ways that could have very serious security and moral\nimplications.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031907",
