  "text": "we fail to spot the signs of a war. But has any of you asked yourselves\nsomething I find myself wondering from time to time? Is there not a similar risk\nif we miss the signs of an opportunity for peace?”\n\nHis words stuck with me for the rest of my time in public life. They also had\na strong impact on me at the time. One of the benefits of my job was that I\ncould read the full inquiry report from the 1973 war, including the portions that\nhad been kept classified. Some dealt with the political situation before the war.\nGolda had relied heavily on a “kitchen cabinet” of trusted ministers and a few\nclose advisers. The inquiry material described how Sadat had been extending\nnegotiating feelers before the war. And how Golda, Eli Zeira, Dado and Dayan\nhad responded. It was like an exercise in collective reinforcement. They agreed\nthe Arab countries would not simply go on living with the humiliation of their\ndefeat in 1967. At some stage, they would try to regain the initiative, on the\nbattlefield. But none appeared to think through the implications of this for our\npolitical approach. Perhaps, like Eli Zeira in 1967, they assumed a kind of\nhistorical inevitability of Israeli trtumph. Though we’d ending up prevailing in\n1973, it was impossible not to wonder whether, as Shlomo suggested, we had\nmissed the signs of a possible peace beforehand.\n\nNow, however, we were facing an escalating challenge from an enemy with\nno interest in peace: the armed Palestinian groups. The Democratic Front took\nover a school in northern Israel a half-year after the war. In March 1975, Fatah\nhad seized the Savoy. And about a year into my posting in the Airya, the Popular\nFront for the Liberation of Palestine launched an even more audacious\noperation.\n\nIt became known by the name of the airport where the ordeal ended.\nEntebbe. And when it began I, like Uzi Yairi, was sitting at my desk.\n\n164\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011635",
