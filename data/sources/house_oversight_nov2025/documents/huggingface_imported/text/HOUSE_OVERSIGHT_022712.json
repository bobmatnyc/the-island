  "text": "Once, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in\nhis dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making\ninvestments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This\nmethod can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it\ndoesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of successful\ninvesting, quickly copies and discounts the advantage. Epstein’s effort was\nto identify a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is effectively\nhawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million with each. I\nknew paltry little about this and so rather found myself identifying with the\nyoung women to whom Epstein was explaining the basic math and\nmechanics—out of my league, but grateful for the lesson.\n\nThe Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and club like,\npart hang out, part secret society. Along with the difficulty in explaining\nwhy, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful have yet beaten a path to\nhis door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf,\nthat everybody, when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.\n\nA week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on\nSunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, TK,\nTK, TK.\n\nEpstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the\npolitics of the middle of East, entertained that evening a delegation from\nQatar, including Sheikh Hamad, the foreign minister. Hamad, indeed, lives\nacross the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the\nsame decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused demeanor, kept prodding:\n“Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of that?”\n\nThe Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most\nworried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery\nallegations.\n\nAt 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining\nroom by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in\ntrouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein.\nWeingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a\nfailed defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland.\n(Epstein: “You actually believe he was getting fucked?” Weingarten:\n“From minute one. I’m not a virgin. But his was the worst I’ve ever seen. It\nwas like an assassination.)\n\nAfter a short discussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving the\nchocolate, made from pistachios grown on the Shakes farm—and\nspeculation about who actually controls ISIS, I am asked to leave the room.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022712",
