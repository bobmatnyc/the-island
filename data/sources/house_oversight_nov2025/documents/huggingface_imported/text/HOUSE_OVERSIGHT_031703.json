  "text": "inconceivable that the US will take any aggressive action\nagainst Iran and will more likely thwart any Israeli initiative.\nThe US will preach the importance of negotiations up until the\nproduction of the first Iranian nuclear weapon - and then state\nthat the world must learn to live with this new reality.\n\nBut this election should be a wake-up call to Jews. There is no permanent empire, nor is there\nan enduring haven for Jews anywhere in the exile. The American empire began to decline in\n2007, and the deterioration has been exacerbated in the last five years. This election only\nhastens that decline.\n\nSociety is permeated with sloth, greed, envy and materialistic excess. It has lost its moorings\nand its moral foundations.. The takers outnumber the givers, and that will only increase in\nyears to come.\n\nThe \"Occupy\" riots across this country in the last two years\nwere mere dress rehearsals for what lies ahead - years of\nunrest sparked by the increasing discontent of the\nunsuccessful who want to seize the fruits and the bounty of\nthe successful, and do not appreciate the slow pace of\nredistribution.\n\nIf this election proves one thing, it is that the Old America is gone. And, sad for the world, it is\n\nnot coming back.\"\nThe problems we face today are there because the people who\n\nwork for a living are outnumbered by those who vote for a\nliving.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031703",
