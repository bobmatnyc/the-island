Patagonia, a $1B global brand that encompasses a\nfocus on the environment and social responsibility in its mission statement, views hemp\nas a “natural fiber that’s cultivated with low impact on the environment.” The brand’s\nassortment includes some hemp-based products made with 100% hemp, which it\nimports from China, or blended with other fibers like recycled polyester, organic cotton,\nand spandex.\n\n2\n\nFigure 116 Patagonia lron Forge Hemp Figure 117 prAna Sharla Sweater (55% Hemp} Figure 118 Men’s (Hemp upper)\nCanvas Ranch Jacket (55% Hemp)\n\nSource: www.patagonia.com Source: www.prana.com Source: www.sanku.com\n\nThere is also a growing market for apparel and footwear that provide recovery\nattributes. For example, Under Armour has its Recovery line of apparel that includes\nCelliant which is designed to “capture body heat and convert it to infrared light that is\nreturned to your body, boosting localized blood flow and upping the amount of oxygen\nreaching your muscles.” Celliant is described as “utilizing a proprietary mineral matrix\nthat can be embedded into the core of a yarn or applied to a wide variety of fabrics.”\nThis demonstrates the ability to weave outside attributes into existing textiles to add\nbeneficial components beyond just providing an item of clothing. With CBD being\nreported as having health and wellness properties, such as to combat inflammation,\nthere could be potential for CBD to be infused into textiles. Canada’s Fashion magazine\nrecently highlighted Devan Chemicals in its 1/4/19 article, “CBD Is Everywhere. Will\nCBC-Infused Clothing Be Next?” Devan Chemicals is a Belgium-based company that has\n“added CBD to their textile solutions portfolio.” The company’s “R Vital’ fabric reflects a\nweave of microcapsules of CBD that release when a person wears the clothing as\ndemonstrated in their website’s flow chart below. While still early stage, perhaps there\nwill be demand for widescale CBD infused textiles, although, as the article points out, it\nis unclear how the “potency” holds up over time and after washing.\n\nCOWEN.COM 71\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024887",
