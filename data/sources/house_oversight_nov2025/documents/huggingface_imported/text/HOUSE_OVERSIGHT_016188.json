  "text": "On a multiples basis, we value Almarai on 21x 2017E EPS, a 15% premium to Global\n(blue chip) food producer averages. We believe that at this level it is fairly valued given\nit is trading at a premium to its historical trading average and the weaker consumer\noutlook.\n\nOur DCF analysis yields a valuation of SAR59/share, based on a WACC of 8% and\nterminal growth rate of 3.5%.\n\nRisks to our PO are company specific factors such as plant outages, disease outbreaks\nin its biological assets, delays in the investment program and factors affecting suppliers.\nMacro level risks are commodity prices, government regulation, subsidy removals and\nprice pressures from growing competition.\n\nBAE SYSTEMS (BAESF / BAESY)\n\nOur PO of 600p (US$34.26/ADR) is an average based on DCF, 2016-17E P/E and\nEV/EBITA and Sum-of-Parts. We regard as BAE's peers Lockheed Martin, LLL, General\nDynamics, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, QinetiQ, Cobham, Ultra Electronics.\n\nOur DCF valuation (8.7% WACC and 1.8% long-term growth rate in line with defence\npeers and 10.7% long term margin) implies a 550p share price. Our SOP suggests at\nvaluation range of 592-595p, using peer group EV/EBITA multiples of 12.7-13.7x and\nEV/sales of 1.2x. Applying EU and US peers multiples on EV/EBITA and P/E yields a\nvaluation range of 671-679p.\n\nAt 600p BAE would be trading on 14.6x 2016E P/E and at 13.9x 2016E EV/EBITA. This\nP/E is in the middle of the historical range of c.20x to c.6x, and the EV/EBITA is near the\nhigh end of the historical range of c.12x to c.4x.\n\nUpside risks are: 1) An export contract for Typhoons, in particular an order for 60+\nairplanes from Saudi, 2) USD strength against the UK, 3) development of a large scale\nand long term conflict.\n\nDownside risks are: 1) significant decrease to the US or UK defence budgets, below our\ncurrent assumptions, 2) significant weakness of the USS vs Sterling.\n\nDallah Healthcare (XJEFF)\n\nWe set a SAR79 price objective for Dallah, which is equivalent to 23x FY17E EPS. We\nexpect earnings to double between FY15A and FY20E as beds triple. The multiple\ntherefore falls quickly and on FY20E earnings, when some of this growth is likely to\nhave come through, the stock trades in-line with other hospital stocks, both EM and\nSaudi.\n\nUpside risks are: greater price increases than assumed in forecasts, faster uptake of\nnew capacity, accretive M&A activity.\n\nDown side risks are: Slowdown in the economy, lower-than-expected growth resulting\nfrom delays in executing on expansion plans, inability to raise prices to offset cost\ninflation, failure to manage growth without impacting margins\n\nDar Al Arkan (XARKF)\n\nOur PO of SAR7.0/share is based on sum-of-the-parts methodology. We\n\nemploy a WACC of 10.7%, derived from a COE and COD of 11.1% and 9.0%,\nrespectively. Our SOTP includes (1) the NPV of the current development portfolio\nto 2016E, (2) the NPV of recurring cash flows from investment portfolio + the NPV\nof its terminal value minus incremental capex to complete the investment\nprogramme, (3) the NPV of land sales from the developed land bank, and (4) the\nbook value (valued at cost) of DAAR s remaining land bank.\n\nDownside risks: (1) Deterioration of demand for land would increase\n\nthe perceived liquidity risk (2) Deterioration of credit environment (3) Emergence\n\n78 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016188",
