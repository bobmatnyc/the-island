Short EUR/GBP as “sending the letter” may be the low point.\n\n¢ EM: Short JPY/KRW, short BRL/MXN as US policies may hurt EM less than feared.\nLong Turkey Eurobonds as sentiment may improve by the referendum in spring.\n\n“Long populism” becoming consensus\n\nWhile we received a lot of pushback for pointing out the risks ahead of the US elections,\nnow “long populism” is quickly becoming consensus. The naysayers may argue that the\nestablishment could reassert itself: conservatives may constrain fiscal stimulus and\nprotectionism, and central bankers may stay dovish (remember the ECB too). We\nsuggest five trade ideas: 1) short inflation/long duration; 2} short EUR/GBP; 3) short\nJPY/KRW; 4) short BRL/MXN; and 5) long Turkey sovereign where populism may calm.\n\nPopulism is getting popular\n\n5y5y US inflation swaps have spiked 60bp since summer to about 2.5% — the biggest\nmove since 2009. As a consequence, EM has sold off sharply. Our pre-election\nsentiment surveys partly explain the violence of the moves since 8 November: investors\nwere long EM bonds and equities and neutral duration in the US (Chart 40). The latest\nCFTC data show a similar picture, with short GBP and long BRL, Crude, RUB and even\nMXN most extreme vs history; note also a short in US Treasuries. Purely statistically\nspeaking, the shorts in GBP and US Treasuries are most vulnerable to a near-term\nreversal — though momentum may prevail for a while in Treasuries (Chart 41). When the\ndust settles, the contrarian may find opportunities in “short populism” trades.\n\nChart 40: Our pre-election surveys show investors bearish GBP, duration Chart 41: CFTC data show positioning is very short GBP\nCash y  10yUS\nEM Duration 65% T y\nUSD FX reasury\nEM equities Notes\nCommod 60% rs\nJPY FX GBP\nJPY Duration BRL\nEUR FX 559, °\nUSD Duration 8 | @ RUB\nUS equities @ Crude oil\nJapan equities\nEurozone equities 50% @ JPY\nBonds\nEquities\nEM FX 9\nGBP Duration 45%\nUK equities\nEUR Duration\nGBP FX 40%\n4 4 2 4 { 2 = 0 { 2 3 a\nNote: positioning score relative to history.
