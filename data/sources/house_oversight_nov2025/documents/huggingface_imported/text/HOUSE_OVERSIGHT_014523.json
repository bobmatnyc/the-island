With a repeal likely to happen well before a replace\n(essentially via the Budget Reconciliation process in Jan/Feb), Andy notes this is likely to include a repeal of both\nhealth insurance exchange subsidies & a phase-down of Medicaid expansion funding (albeit with a two or three year\ntransition period).\n\nHe also expects a repeal of many of the larger HC related taxes in the ACA, including the HIX ($14.3bn in 2018),\nMedtech Tax (2.3%), pharma industry tax ($4.1bn in 2018) & Cadillac tax (effective 2020).\n\nAs for the views by analysts...\nBiotech (+) — believe sector will outperform largely as pricing risk has diminished (although will remain in pockets) but\npipelines/growth remains. Ying’s top picks are CELG & REGN; Tazeen’s top picks are ACAD & RARE.\n\nSpec Pharma (-) — headwinds remain w/ Sumant’s top pick AGN given lower risk to reimbursement pressures & an\nunderappreciated pipeline. Leverage & CF remain the key focus for investors.\n\nTools/Animal Health (=) — Derik notes more “headline” than “real” risks from policy which will create opportunities for a\ngroup growing MSD, although valuations remain above peers. DHR (US 1 name) top pick, also A, ZTS in Animal\nHealth, BDX in Diagnostics & CTLT in Services.\n\nMedtech (=) — Hopkins’ expects a mixed bag in 2017 w/ stocks trading close to 5yr valuation lows; EW top pick given\nbest growth / purest innovation story.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014523",
