  "text": "The Bard schools are not charter schools. They are financed by New York State and New\nJersey. However, they run with the efficiency and success of a prominent charter school.\nThe schools are small, with less than 600 students each and a student teacher ratio of 20\nto 1. Admission is academically exclusive, focusing on academic records, writing and math\nassessments and an eagerness for ideas and learning. And like most charter schools, the\nBHSEC schools critically have autonomy, even though they have to meet Regent state\nexams and state graduation guidelines. They have the autonomy to run their teaching\nstaff, budget, operations and curriculum.\n\nUnlike charter schools however, BHSEC schools provide an entire high school curriculum\nin just two years and then two years of college level credits. After four years, students\ngraduate with sixty college credits, a state Regents high school diploma and a Bard College\nAssociate in Arts degree in the liberal arts and sciences. This accelerated approach comes\nfrom the schools' belief that many young people are ready and eager to do serious college\nwork at age sixteen and that young adults’ ambition to learn must be taken seriously.\n\nThe results have been exceptional: 95% of BHSEC graduates attend college. In July 2009,\nPresident Obama, addressing the NAACP's centennial convention cited the schools as a\nrole model for the nation: \"Innovations like Bard High School Early College and Medgar\nEvers College Preparatory School that are challenging students to complete high school\nand earn a free associate's degree or college credit in just four years.” In 2012, The New\nYork Observer ranked BHSEC as the #1 public high school in New York City, with an A+\ngrade, outranking the top private school.\n\nBHSEC has its roots in the college system. In June 2001, The New York City Board of\nEducation and Bard College created Bard High School Early College with the support of\nthe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Since the 1960's Bard College, originally called,\nBard College of Simon's Rock, was the nation's only four year college and was designed for\nyounger scholars.\n\n\"Competition is tough,” Jeffrey Epstein notes, whose foundation actively supports public\neducation across the country. \"Approximately 7,000 applicants compete for 150 seats each\nfall. So we need to continue working with state education boards to duplicate this\nsuccessful model.”\n\nhttp: //www.jeffreyepstein.org\nSOURCE http://www. jeffreyepstein.org\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026568",
