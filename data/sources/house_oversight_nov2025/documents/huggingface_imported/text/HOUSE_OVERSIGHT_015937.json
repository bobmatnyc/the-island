  "text": "Software 247\n\ndenotes a set of sequential steps we can apply to demonstrate this fact.\nThese steps must have meaning and obey the rules of mathematics, but\nwhat are these rules? Are they written down in a text book?\n\nIt turns out there is no way to find this set of rules; it is a super-\ninfinite task. We would need to reach into our infinite bag of numbers\nand pull out rule after rule, turning each into a mathematical model\nthat explains numbers and logic and what can be done with them to\nform mathematical statements. The number of ways to do this is not just\ninfinity, but two to the power of infinity. This is the number of ways to\npermute all possible mathematical rules.\n\nYour mind may be rebelling at this. Surely, if I have an infinite\nset of numbers I can just pluck all the numbers from my bag and then\nI am certain to have the solution. Unfortunately, it turns out there is\nno complete, consistent set of rules; no valid dictionary that maps all\nnumbers to all of mathematics. That is Gédel incompleteness theorem.\n\nDespite a fundamental limit on mapping all numbers to all of\nmathematics, there might still have been an algorithm which could\npractically find solutions for a given arbitrary problem. Turing proved\nthis is not the case.\n\nThe Wiles Paradox\nTuring showed us there can be no general purpose, mechanical procedure\ncapable of finding solutions to arbitrary problems. A computer program\ncannot discover mathematical theorems nor write programs to do so. Yet\ncomputers regularly solve problems and generate programs. That’s what\nsoftware compilers do. This seems to be contradiction.\n\nThe solution to this apparent contradiction is to propose a boundary:\na ‘logic limit’ above which computers may not solve problems. With a\nhigh boundary a general-purpose machine could solve most problems\nin the real world, though some esoteric mathematical puzzles would be\nbeyond it. But if the boundary were low, many activities in our daily life\nwould need some sort of alternative, creative thinking. It is crucial to\nknow where the logic limit lies.\n\nThe Logic Limit\n\nAmazingly, in many branches of science it is possible to pinpoint the exact\nlocation of the logic limit, but finding that boundary in mathematics has\ntaken forty years work from some of the greatest mathematicians of the\n20\" century.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015937",
