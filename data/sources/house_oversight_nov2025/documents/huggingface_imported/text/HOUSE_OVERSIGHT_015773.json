  "text": "Body Language & Banter 83\n\nSmiles Fake or Real\n\nin person. No great treaty or big industrial contract has been negotiated\nwithout a face-to-face meeting. We see this daily: people talking on the\nphone get to a certain point, give up, and arrange to meet in person.\n\nThe consequence is that we spend $550 billion annually, flying\naround the globe to meet each other. Each day the world’s population\ntakes three million plane flights. Around 80% of these are business\nflights. Some are people emigrating or going to do specific manual tasks,\nbut most are to have meetings. We have always assumed that this is\nbecause the parties are unable to reach a sufficient level of trust over the\nphone and need face-to-face interaction to build that trust, but it may\nbe that the parties are not able to convey sufficient information to fully\nunderstand each other. Face-to-face meeting may convey much more\ninformation than we think.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015773",
