  "text": "107\n\nAll told, major Chinese companies publicly acknowledge spending $3.8 million on\n\nfederal lobbying in 2017 and $20.2 million in total since 2000,” modest amounts by\nglobal standards. The Chinese e-commerce behemoth, Alibaba, was the largest source of\nexpenditures in 2017, accounting for $2 million, followed by technology company ZTE\n($510k), Sinopec ($384k),?> and the Wanda America Group ($300k), affiliated with Dalian\nWanda.” More difficult to track is Chinese corporate participation in American trade\nassociations. In early 2018, two Chinese companies have joined two major lobbying groups\nnoted for their political heft.?°\n\nIndirect Donations A key exception to the ban on foreign federal campaign contributions\nis permitted through activity conducted via a US subsidiary of a foreign company.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission has written that “where permitted by state law, a US\nsubsidiary of a foreign national corporation may donate funds for state and local elections\n\nif (1) the donations derive entirely from funds generated by the subsidiaries’ US operations,\nand (2) all decisions concerning the donations, except those setting overall budget amounts,\nare made by individuals who are US citizens or permanent residents.”\n\nThis exception inherently creates the potential for exploitation, particularly given the\nintrinsic difficulties of monitoring and enforcement. For example, the Intercept has reported\nthat American Pacific International Capital (APIC), an American subsidiary of a corporation\nowned by a Chinese citizen, contributed $1.3 million to the Super PAC of presidential\ncandidate Jeb Bush on the advice of a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer.”®\n(Neil Bush, the brother of George W. and Jeb Bush, and former ambassador Gary Locke have\nserved as advisors of American Pacific International.)?”\n\nEmployees of Chinese enterprises, who in making the donations are presumably American\ncitizens, are also active donors. A review of campaign donation data finds that several\nindividuals cited as members of the China General Chamber of Commerce or employed\nby member firms have made recent campaign contributions. For example, two individuals\nassociated with HNA Group, including Tan Xiandong, the group’s president, in 2017\ndonated $2,500 each to the congressional campaign of Greg Pence, the brother of the vice\npresident.’*\n\nIn May 2018, China-based companies reportedly invited Chinese to attend several\nRepublican Party fund-raising dinners at which President Trump would appear. The\ninvitations prominently featured the Republican Party’s logo along with that of\n\nChina Construction Bank, making it appear as if there was some formal connection.”\nThe Republican Party and China Construction Bank both denied awareness of the\nsolicitations in their name. Foreigners may attend fund-raisers so long as they do not pay\ntheir own entry, another instance in which the fungibility of money makes it easy to\nskirt this rule.\n\nSection 7\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020566",
