For some\nexamples: One of his archetypal singularities was a boundary at x = 0 such that the\nflow couldn’t spread from where it was in x>0O into x< 0 and was therefore like the\nborder, the membrane, between the inside and outside of a cell as well as the\nhoped for sociopolitical functions of the Great Wall of China and the Maginot Line. If\nwe were to blow up the boundary line from two to three dimensions, R’—R®, the\nstraight boundary line becomes a cylinder for directionally organizing and\nconnecting flows as in blood vessels, oil pipes, cables and wires. Since production\nand delivery need not occur at similar rates, temporary storage is required and may\ntake the form of a spherical blow-up in the vertical segment of R® leading to an open\nbottle which may serve as a dead end storage branch of a network of connected\ncylinders. In the conceptual reductionism of Semiophysics, Thom said, “...life is\nessentially a question of embankment, canalization and the struggle to stem\ndispersion.” These structures of mind and world are built and maintained.\nCoagulation of blood is an example of a canalized fluid repairing gaps like a\ntubeless tire. Thom considered apparent the problem of making something from\nnothing, birth, that of finding the hidden sources: the bubbling spring emerges from\nan unseen, underground network of canalized fluid flow converging on the apparent\nsource, birth being the invisible becoming visible. In contrast, a canalized flow\nemptying into lake can represent disappearance as a flow.\n\nMathematicians from all over the world attended Thom’s 65\" birthday\ncelebration at HES. His Field’s Medal winning work on the topology of differentiable\n(smooth) manifolds, cobordism and related ideas, was mentioned frequently, and\ngreat homage paid to him with respect to these areas of his work. However, in two\ndays of lectures of personal and professional tribute by the world’s great\nmathematicians, his work relevant to Catastrophe Theory and Semiophysics was\nnot mentioned, even once. The form taken by mathematicians’ most severe\njudgments is silence. As the New York Times’ Natalie Angier’s comments indicated,\n\nthis is not the time for the intuitive conduct of applied mathematics.\n\n181\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013681",
