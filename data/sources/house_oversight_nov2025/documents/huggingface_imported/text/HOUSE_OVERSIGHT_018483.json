It's hard to keep their needs in mind; it's easier to just assume that if they wanted\nanything, it was their responsibility to try to get it. I always preferred to take sexual\ninitiative, and that has become even more ego-congruent. (pages 397-398, Speaking Sex\nTo Power)\n\nA trans woman friend once told me that not only did she get turned on more frequently\npre-transition; also, she now has to feel more emotionally connected to her partner in\norder to enjoy sex. And she noted that she has to \"take care of herself more\" in order to\nfeel turned on now -- not just in the moment, but in life, and in the relationship.\n\nIf we accept that there is, speaking generally, a difference in sexual desires between men\nand women (although individuals will always be unique), then it leads to new questions.\nIf women were socially and culturally dominant, what would so-called \"liberated\nsexuality\" look like? If people of all genders are following patterns set by stereotypical\nmen, then what does that mean for attempts to think around those patterns?\n\n6) Communicating consent is complicated, but consent is the only thing that makes\nsex okay, so we have to make every effort to respect it. All sex is completely fine with\nme as long as it's consensual. Seriously, I really don't care what you do -- as long as it's\nconsensual. (Try to find a consensual sex act that shocks me. I dare you.)\n\nCommunicating consent can, however, be complicated, and there are lots of different\nways to do it. Many BDSMers are eminently familiar with this, as you can tell by the fact\nthat some parts of the BDSM community have developed an extensive array of tactics for\ndiscussing consent. For example, the most famous BDSM communication tactic is\nsafewords, which gives everyone involved a clear word that they can invoke to stop the\naction at any time.\n\nMost people don't communicate directly about most things, and the stigma and high\nemotions around sexuality make it even harder for most people to communicate directly\nabout sex. Hence, most sexual communication is highly indirect. Even among people\nwho are accustomed to direct sexual communication -- like many BDSMers -- a lot of\ncommunication ends up being indirect and instinctive anyway; there's just no way to\ndiscuss every possible reaction and every single desire ahead of time. Everyone fucks up\nsometimes. No one in the world has a perfect track record on creating a pressure-free\nenvironment for their partners to express what they want... or asking their partners for\nwhat they want... or even knowing what they want in the first place.\n\nSo, yes, I acknowledge that communicating about sex and getting what you want\nconsensually can be really hard. However, it's most important to not violate people's\nboundaries. No matter how hard it is, it's necessary to make a serious and genuine effort\nto measure and respect a partner's consent every time sex happens. Feminist ideas of\nenthusiastic consent are designed to help this process.\n\nHere's my attempt at a quick definition of enthusiastic consent:\n\nThe basic idea is simple: don't initiate sex unless you have your partner's enthusiastic\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018483",
