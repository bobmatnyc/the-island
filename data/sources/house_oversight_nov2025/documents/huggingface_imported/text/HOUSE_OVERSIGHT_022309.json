  "text": "54038\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nNo Statutory Authority for the Proposed\nRule\n\nThe majority concedes that the\n“National Labor Relations Act does not\ndirectly address an employer’s\nobligation to post a notice of its\nemployees’ rights arising under the Act\nor the consequences an employer may\nface for failing to do so.”’ In fact, the\nNLRA 173 makes no mention of any such\nputative obligation. The majority further\nacknowledges that the NLRA “is almost\nunique among major Federal labor laws\nin not including an express statutory\nprovision requiring employers routinely\nto post notices at their workplaces\ninforming employees of their statutory\nrights.’’ Despite the obvious import of\nthese admissions, the majority\nconcludes that the Board’s plenary\nauthority under Section 6 of the Act to\nmake rules “necessary to carry out the\nprovisions of the Act” permits\npromulgation of the rule they advocate.\nI disagree.\n\nCongress did not give specific\nstatutory authority to the Board to\nrequire the posting of a general rights\nnotice when it passed the Wagner Act\nin 1935. Just one year earlier, however,\nCongress amended the Railway Labor\nAct (“RLA’’) to include an express\nnotice-posting requirement. 45 U.S.C.\n152 Eighth; Pub. L. No. 73-442, 48 Stat.\n1185, 1188 (1934). As the Supreme\nCourt noted, the RLA served as the\nmodel for the National Labor Relations\nAct. NLRBB v. Pennsylvania Greyhound\nLines, 303 U.S. 261 (1938). See also\nNLEB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,\n301 U.S. 1, 44 (1937); H. J. Heinz Co. v.\nNLRB, 311 U.S. 514, 524-525(1941).\n\nThat Congress did not include an\nexpress notice-posting requirement\nwhen passing the Wagner Act the\nfollowing year strongly implies, if not\ncompels, the conclusion that Congress\ndid not intend for the Board to have\nregulatory authority to require such a\nnotice. Nothing in the legislative history\nhints of any concern by Congress about\nthe need for employers to notify\nemployees generally of their rights\nunder the new enacting statute. Since\n1935, despite extensive revisions in the\nTaft-Hartley Act amendments of 1947\nand the Landrum-Griffin Act\namendments of 1959, Congress has\nnever added such authority.\n\nOn the other hand, when Congress\nhas subsequently desired to include a\ngeneral rights notice-posting\nrequirement, it has done so expressly in\nother federal labor and employment\n\n173 Throughout this dissent, I will refer generally\nto the statute we administer as the NLRA, unless\nthe discussion focuses on a specific historical\nversion, such as the Wagner Act.\n\nlaws. See Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 (Title VID), 42 U.S.C.\n2000e—10, the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. 627,\nThe Occupational Safety and Health\nAct, 29 U.S.C. 657(c), the Americans\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.\n12115, the Family and Medical Leave\nAct (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. 2619(a), and the\nUniformed Service Employment and\nReemployment Rights Act (USERRA),\n38 U.S.C. 4334(a).\n\nThe majority points out that the\nDepartment of Labor (DOL) promulgated\na notice-posting rule under the Fair\nLabor Standards Act (FLSA), although\nthat statute does not contain a specific\nstatutory provision on workplace\npostings. However, the FLSA, unlike the\nNLRA, imposes a data-collection and\nrecordkeeping requirement on\nemployers. 29 U.S.C. 211{c). DOL’s\nWage and Hour Administrator\npromulgated the notice-posting\nregulation in 1949 in reliance on this\nrequirement. It appears that the\npropriety of the FLSA rule has never\nbeen challenged, perhaps because,\nunlike the rule promulgated herein,\nthere are no citations or penalties\nassessed for the failure to post. This is\na significant point of distinction that\nwarrants further discussion.\n\nIt must be constantly borne in mind\nthat the rule promulgated today makes\nthe failure to post the required notice a\nviolation of the Act. The majority\nmisleadingly seeks to decouple\nobligation from violation in its analysis\nby discussing the latter in the context of\nenforcement of the assertedly lawful\nnotice-posting rule. That is nonsense.\nMaking noncompliance an unfair labor\npractice is integral to the rule and,\nconsequently, integral to an analysis of\nwhether the notice-posting requirement\nis a permissible exercise of the Board’s\nrulemaking authority. Of the\naforementioned agencies that have\nnotice-posting requirements, none of\nthem makes the failure to post unlawful,\nabsent additional specific statutory\nauthorization. Only the RLA, Title VII,\nFMLA, and the Occupational Safety Act\n(OSHA) have such authorizing language.\nADA, the ADEA, the FLSA, and the\nUSERRA do not. Consequently, an\nemployer’s failure to post a notice under\nthose statutes is not subject to sanction\nas unlawful.\n\nThus, both before and after the\nWagner Act, Congress has consistently\nmanifested by express statutory\nlanguage its intent to impose a general\nnotice-posting duty on employers with\nrespect to the rights of employees under\nvarious federal labor laws. Only one\nadministrative agency promulgated a\nnotice-posting requirement in the\n\nabsence of such language in its enabling\nstatute. No agency has made the failure\nto comply with a notice-posting\nrequirement unlawful absent express\nstatutory authorization, until today.\n\nThe explicit inclusion of notice-\nposting provisions and permissible\nsanctions by Congress in other labor\nlegislation undercuts the majority’s\nclaim that this notice-posting rule is not\na “major policy decision properly made\nby Congress alone.” Strangely, the\nmajority does not merely contend that\nthis pattern in comparable labor\nlegislation fails to prove that Congress\ndid not intend that the Board should\nhave the rulemaking authority under\nSection 6 to mandate the notice posting\nat issue here. They conversely contend\nthat it proves Congress must have\nintended to confer such authority on the\nBoard! 174\n\nPerhaps cognizant of the weakness of\nthis position, the majority attempts to\ndownplay the import of Congressional\nsilence on the Board’s authority to\nmandate notice posting and to enforce\nthat mandate through unfair labor\npractice sanctions. They cite Cheney\nR.R. Co. v. ICC, 902 F. 2d 66, 68-69\n(D.C. Cir. 1990), for the proposition that\nthe maxim “‘expressio unius est exclusio\nalterius,” which holds that the special\nmention of one thing indicates an intent\nfor another thing not be included\nelsewhere, may not always be a useful\ntool for interpreting the intent of\nCongress. Obviously, the usefulness of\nthis tool depends on the context of a\nparticular statute. Independent Ins.\nAgents of Am., Inc. v. Hawke, 211 F.3d\n638 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (applying the\nmaxim). In my view, the absence of an\nexpress notice provision in the NLRA,\nand the failure to amend the Act to\ninclude one when Congress expressly\nincluded notice posting provisions in\nother labor statutes, shows that it did\nnot intend to authorize the Board to\npromulgate this rule.175\n\nArguing to the contrary, the majority\nasserts that the notice-posting rule is\n\n174 Of course, this reasoning would seem to\ndictate that the failure of the Board to inform its\nown employees of their general rights under the\nFederal Labor Relations Act is an unfair labor\npractice, even though that statute imposes no such\nexpress requirement. To date, I am not aware that\nthis agency, or any other, views itself as subject to\nsuch an enforceable obligation.\n\n175 The majority contends that the fact that the\nrule comes 76 years after the NLRA was enacted is\nnot a “condition of validity.” Mayo Foundation for\nMedical Education and Research v. United States,\n131 S.Ct. 704, 713-14 (2011) (quoting Smiley v.\nCitibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 740 (1996)\n(“neither antiquity nor contemporaneity with the\nstatute is a condition of validity.”). I have no\nproblem with that proposition, but if the Board\nlacks statutory authority to promulgate a rule, it is\nof no matter that it attempts to do so in year 1 or\nyear 76 of its existence.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022309",
