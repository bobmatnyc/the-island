I prefer to think of myself\nas an advocate for human rights...” Dershowitz’s definition of human rights is\nuncomplicated. He applies to the world at large a “core concept of human\nrights”—everyone should be free to express opinions and views, to read what one\nchooses, to have some influence in the process of government, to leave one’s country.\nOne should be free from arbitrary arrest and trial, torture and execution.\n\nWherever human rights are trampled, Dershowitz feels compelled to lend a hand, if\npossible. “I try hard to balance my attack, right and left—for every attack on the Soviet\nUnion, there’s one on Chile. For every attack on a right-wing repressive government,\nthere should be an attack on a left-wing repressive government.”\n\nDershowitz’s strong personal identification with human rights goes back to his roots.\n“There but for the grace of my great grandparents go I,” he paraphrases. “If I were a 39\nyear old citizen of Kiev or wherever, I sure as hell hope I'd be a dissident and I suspect\nthat there would be someone here trying to get me out.”\n\n“Tf there is discrimination against anybody, there is discrimination against everybody,” he\nsays flatly, which explains his decision to defend John Lucido, a Catholic Italian lawyer,\nwho filed suit against Cravath, Swaine and Moore, charging that the firm had failed to\npromote him to a partnership because of his nationality, his religion or both.”\n\nDershowitz loves to teach and has integrated some of his human rights experiences into a\nseminar which he taught this spring with Visiting Professor Telford Taylor ’32, pioneer in\nthe international protecting of human rights. The seminar taught future lawyers how to\ndefend foreign dissident clients and how to promote human rights in other nations.\n\n“T think there are always between 30 and 100 students at the School who are really\ninterested in these issues. That’s not to say that all of them, or even half of them, will\nultimately involve themselves in the human rights struggle but at least they will be in a\nposition to make substantial contributions in the area during their career.”\n\nThis is one of the basic reasons for his remaining in teaching. As Dershowitz puts it, “In\npractice you can do a lot to implement human rights in this generation but in teaching you\ncan both help this generation and help plant the seeds for progress later on.”\n\nDespite my deep involvement in human rights work, I wondered whether I was really having a\ndiscernable impact on the problems of the world. Unlike litigation in American courts, where the\nresults are immediately evident, the impact of petitions, op ed articles, Congressional resolutions,\nand other conventional human rights activities on foreign countries tends to be less visible or\nimmediate.\n\nI will never forget one encounter that made it all seem worth the apparently unrewarded efforts. I\nattended a concern by the great Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, several years after he left\nthe Soviet Union.
