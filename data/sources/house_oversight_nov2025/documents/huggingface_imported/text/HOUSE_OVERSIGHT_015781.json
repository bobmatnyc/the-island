Give yourself a moment\nto try to learn this string of characters.\n\nHALTNTIBMGTATLAMATLOLPOMSGTG\nTRY TO MEMORIZE THE STRING WITHOUT READING ON\n\nNow, if I divide it into chunks, you will see it includes meaningful\ninformation.\n\nHAL TNT IBM GTA TLA MAT LOL POMS GTG\n\nYou probably won't recognize all the acronyms unless you are\nunder 10. Even then, you will find memorizing it hard, but if you put the\nsequence into the context of a story then it is much easier to learn.\n\nHAL uses TNT to blow up the IBM building in Grand Theft Auto.\n“Three Letter Acronyms are annoying, says MAT. I’m Laughing Out\nLoud; Parents Over My Shoulder. Got To Go.\n\nWe find it easier to fit new information into existing structures\nwithin our brains rather than memorizing by rote. I’ve used quite a\nbit of modern Internet slang here. You'll find young people recall this\ninformation better than older people for whom GTG and POMS are\nnonsense.\n\nIf you want to memorize something, experts recommend you\nimagine bizarre images and relate them to a story pictured in the mind’s\neye. Try it and you may very well find you can still remember my sentence\nin ten years time!\n\nLet’s try something else. The following sentences are a little different,\nyet the recall scores for information in the two are dramatically different:\n\n1. I met an old tramp on 42™ Street wearing a dirty grey rain coat.\n2. New York on a cold damp November day; as I cross the street\nI bump into an old man wearing a dirty grey Macintosh. His\n\nshuffling gait suggests some sordid intent. I think nothing of it,\nbut this brief meeting was to change my life.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015781",
