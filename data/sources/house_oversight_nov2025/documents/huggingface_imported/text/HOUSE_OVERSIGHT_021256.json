Objectivity in thought\nand analysis are keys to reaching\na deep understanding of a topic.\nBy taking a position, developing\narguments for and against the\nposition, then taking the opposite\nposition and doing likewise, we\ndevelop the capacity to be more\ndispassionate and powerful\nthinkers — and gain deeper\ninsight into a topic.\n\nthat one need not reach\nagreement with someone to learn\na great deal from discussions\nwith them or to make significant\nadvances in addressing a\ncomplex question. The salve of\naffirmation can lead us to seek\nlike-minded others and to\ndenigrate and avoid those who\ndisagree with us. Although this\nmay provide temporary comfort,\nit does little to help address deep\ndivisions or solve problems with\nwhich we must deal in an\nincreasingly complex and diverse\nworld. There are inherent\ntensions between the sciences\nand the humanities, and these\ntensions have led to a\npolarization of views, an “it’s my\nway or the highway” approach\ntoward those holding divergent\npoints of view. The contents of\nthis book illustrate an alternative\npossibility. The Network is a\nvery interdisciplinary group, and\nthe perspectives captured in the\nsubsequent chapters reflect some\nof the same tensions with which\nother books dealing with science\nand religion have dealt — and\n\nPage |10\n\nfrom which they have not\nbenefitted. The tensions reflect\ndeep and enduring differences in\nthe way in which scholars in the\nhumanities, the social sciences,\nand the sciences think about\ntheory, methods, and evidence.\nThese differences can test one’s\nmettle but if acknowledged,\nrespected, embraced, and\npursued, they result in a richer,\nmore innovative and synergistic\ncollaborative effort. In the case\nof our Network, this was neither\neasy nor quick, but it was\nachieved through a mutual\nrespect and exchange of ideas\nand a shared conviction\nregarding the importance of the\nNetwork’s combination of\napproaches from the humanities\nand the sciences. In a sense, our\nNetwork is a microcosm of the\nstructure that exists in our\nsociety. If these tensions are\nembraced and used to their full\ncatapultic effect, one can make\nprogress on serious problems,\ntransforming not only how we\nthink about the problem, but also\nhow we think about those who\nhold different or opposing views.\nthat the insights or advances we\ncan achieve need not be our or\nour opponent’s position, or a\nless-than optimal compromise\nbetween the two, but rather they\ncan be truly innovative, building\non and transcending both initial\npositions. The specific forms of\nsuch creative and transcendent\nsolutions are difficult to\narticulate in advance but there is\na thought process — characterized\nby clarity, openness, constructive\ncriticism, and synthesis — that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021256",
