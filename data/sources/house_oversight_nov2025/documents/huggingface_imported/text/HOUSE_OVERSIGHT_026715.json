  "text": "Leading adopters are embedding governance-based\nengagement, with an expectation of improved long-\nterm returns\nWhile non-adopters wait on the evidence of ESG\ninvestment outcomes, leading adopters are moving\nfurther down the path of integrating ESG principles\ninto investment allocation and management\ndecisions, including through active engagement with\nor participation in investee company decision-making.\nLarger sovereigns with internal asset management\ncapability were most confident in their ability to\nexecute their ESG strategies, due to their higher levels\nof engagement with their investments (figure 25).\nThese larger sovereigns noted that direct engagement\nbenefits substantially outweighed the cost of external\nadvisers and representation; notably\n- The largest sovereigns drew a clear line from long-\nterm investor influence on corporate structure\nand executive remuneration to ‘active’ investment\nperformance through the cycle\n- Sovereigns felt able to better represent the interest\nof government or non-government stakeholders\nthrough direct engagement\n- Finally, for sovereigns committed to ESG, direct\ngovernance engagement provided a mechanism\nto proactively drive an ESG agenda in future\ninvestment and management decision-making\n\n35\n\nFuture uptake of ESG integration requires more\nperformance data, while growth in active ownership\nrequires third-party assistance\n\nThe adoption of negative screens is encouraging\n\nfor ESG advocates; however, the majority of current\n\nnon-adopters are unwilling to move further in the\n\nabsence of strong objective evidence of positive\ninvestment risk/return outcomes from ESG investing\nrelative to cost. ESG adopters overwhelmingly\nobserve a positive differential in long-term returns\n\n(with 70% of respondents perceiving an increase\n\nin returns from ESG as seen in figure 26), and\n\nmany adopters explained that they were seeking to\n\nintegrate systematic ESG risk measurement into the\n\ninvestment process. However, ESG user and non-user\nrespondents acknowledge that there is a need for\nrobust data on integrated ESG strategies, which can\nonly be addressed through continued measurement\nof the impact on performance.\n\nDespite uncertainties around the impact of ESG\nintegration, there is a growing consensus among all\nrespondents on the positive effect of governance\non investment returns. However, there are many\nchallenges to developing and managing an active\nownership strategy:\n\n- Many sovereigns have not defined their governance\nprinciples and were wary of demanding levels of\ntransparency from their investees that the sovereign\nfund itself did not provide\n\n- The adoption of active ownership requires hiring\nsubject matter experts, and many investment\nsovereign respondents were intent on using\nrecruitment budget to expand internal investment\nteams\n\n- Certain sovereigns did not hold shareholder voting\nrights across the majority of their securities and\nwere wary of the costs involved in switching these\ninvestments for those with voting rights\n\n- Many respondents stated that they were challenged\nby lack of engagement from consultants and asset\nmanagers\n\nWhile smaller sovereigns have been dissuaded from\n\ninvestment engagement by these cost restraints,\n\nevidence of benefits in returns and representation\n\nof sovereign interests will be key in driving greater\n\nuptake of sovereign active ownership. With some\n\nsovereigns looking internally to invest, based on the\nability to embed government-based engagement,\nasset managers must respond by offering sovereigns\nthe opportunity participate in the stewardship of\ncompanies by means of voting rights.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026715",
