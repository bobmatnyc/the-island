  "text": "Liquidity sovereigns\n\nLiquidity sovereigns manage assets to stimulate\neconomies that are highly dependent on commodity\nprices during a market shock. Due to the unpredictable\nand sudden nature of outflows, liquidity sovereigns\nhave extremely short time horizons and prioritise\nportfolio liquidity above investment returns. Despite\nlow yields of government bonds, liquidity sovereigns\nare unable to seek higher returns from alternative\nasset classes due to the inherent liquidity risk.\n\nDevelopment sovereigns\n\nThe asset and geographic allocation of development\nsovereigns is driven by the requirement to encourage\nlocal economic growth (rather than investment\nreturn). Development sovereigns take large (often\ncontrolling) stakes in companies of economic\nsignificance in order to grow their presence in\n\nthe local market. While other sovereigns adjust\nallocations to maximise their asset growth and yield,\ndevelopment sovereigns consider their success\n\nin economic metrics such as GDP growth and job\ncreation, working closely with their investments to\ngrow long-term strategic assets. This means that\ndevelopment funds are relatively unreactive to\nreturn shortfalls and asset allocation trends.\n\nCentral banks\n\nCentral banks are ‘lenders of last resort’ - managers\nof a large foreign reserves portfolio to bail out\nfinancial institutions of public importance. Due to\n\nthe importance of maintaining reserves to sufficiently\ncover such requirements, preservation of capital\n\nis of greatest importance. Central banks also have\nhigh levels of public accountability and disclosure,\nencouraging risk aversion through short time horizons\nand highly liquid investments. While other sovereigns\ninvest in home market assets, central bank reserve\nmanagers hold the majority of their assets in foreign\nsecurities, increasing the importance of currency\nexposure relative to other sovereigns.\n\nUnlike sovereign investors, central banks have\nobjectives outside of reserves management, including\nlocal market liquidity management and maintenance\nof currency pegs. Since these external factors have\ninfluence over the foreign reserves, in this study we\nconsider central banks separately from sovereign\ninvestors. However, as many government bonds have\nnegative yields, certain central banks have looked to\ninvest in non-traditional asset classes (e.g. equities)\nto preserve their capital, closer aligning their foreign\nreserves investment strategy to that of sovereign\nwealth funds.\n\nFunding challenges\nand the low return\nenvironment have\nunique implications\nfor each sovereign\nsegment.\n\nInvestment & liquidity\n\nLiquidity sovereigns\n\n(ale)\n\n(DEV)\n\nInvestment & development\n\nDevelopment sovereigns\n\nCapital p\n\nCentral banks!\n(CB)\n\n03\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026683",
