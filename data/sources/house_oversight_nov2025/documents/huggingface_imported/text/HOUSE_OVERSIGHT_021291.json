Loneliness has\nalso been associated with a decrease in\nhealth-restoring processes. Sleep is the\nquintessential example. Much of what\nfeels stressful and depressing at the end\nof a long day is perceived differently\nfollowing a good night’s sleep. Good\nquality sleep is the clincher. Lonely and\nnon-lonely individuals do not differ in\nthe amount of sleep they get, but lonely\npeople have poorer sleep quality than do\nnon-lonely people. They experience\nmore micro-awakenings during the night\nand they awake feeling more tired and\nless capable of meeting the demands of\nthe day. Poor sleep has been associated\nwith elevated blood pressure and\ncardiovascular mortality, and this may\nhelp to explain the poorer health\noutcomes of chronically lonely\nindividuals. In short, lonely days extend\ninto the nights and lessen the restorative\nnature of sleep.\n\nLoneliness and Health: It’s Not Just\nPeripheral\n\nFrom this sampling of the\nwidespread effects of loneliness on\nhealth, lifestyle behaviors, physiological\nfunctioning, genetic transcription, and\nsleep quality, it should be clear that the\ninvisible power of felt isolation has long\ntentacles that have the potential to\ninfluence all of physiology. Not only\nphysical health, but also cognitive health\nis compromised. Indeed, one of the most\nsobering findings of recent years is that\nloneliness places people at risk for\nimpaired cognition and dementia.\" In a\n4-year prospective study of initially\ndementia-free older adults, the risk of\nAlzheimer’s Disease was more than\n\nPage |45\n\ntwice as great in lonely than in\nnonlonely individuals. In addition,\nloneliness was associated with lower\ncognitive ability at baseline and with a\nmore rapid decline in cognition during\nthe 4-year follow-up. Similar results\nwere reported for a sample of 75-85-\nyear-old individuals over a 10-year\nfollow-up.\n\nThe effects of loneliness on\ncognition are evident at an even more\nfundamental level.\"' Self-regulation, or\nthe ability to regulate one’s attention,\ncognition, emotion, and/or behavior to\nbetter meet social standards or personal\ngoals, is impaired in lonely individuals.\nFor instance, among young adults,\ninstructions to shift auditory attention\nfrom the dominant right ear to the non-\ndominant left ear resulted in impaired\nperformance in lonely relative to\nnonlonely individuals. Loneliness also\nalters emotion regulation. In middle-\naged and older adults, loneliness was\nassociated with a diminished tendency to\ncapitalize on positive emotions, and this\nexplained why lonely individuals were\nless likely than nonlonely individuals to\nengage in physical activity. Impaired\ncognitive regulation is evident in\nexperimental studies that manipulate\nfeelings of isolation. Participants who\nreceive feedback that induces a sense\nthat they are doomed to a future of social\nisolation perform significantly worse on\ntests of reasoning, behave more\naggressively, and choose more tasty but\nunhealthy foods than other participants\nwho receive feedback indicating a future\nof social connection or bad feedback of a\nnon-social nature, namely that their\nfuture will consist of general\nmisfortune.'* There seems to be\nsomething uniquely threatening about\nthe prospect, and the reality, of feeling\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021291",
