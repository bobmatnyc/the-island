  "text": "ceremony with both the Interior Minister and the Prime Minister present. The\nfirst was in Ofakim, near where I’d worked in the fields with Yigal Garber in\nthe 1950s. Shortly after we arrived, a group of protestors started shouting at\nRabin. Manyac, they yelled, “maniac”. Boged: traitor. At the second event, near\nHaifa, busloads of protestors from right-wing religious schools shouted abuse at\nRabin when he rose to speak.\n\nAs the Knesset vote on Oslo II approached, the hatred reached new levels.\nThe day before, thousands of protesters packed into Jerusalem’s Zion Square.\nSome shouted “Death to Rabin!” Others burned pictures of him, or passed out\nphotos of him dressed in an Arab keffityeh, or even a Nazi uniform. Bibi had\npublicly declared that opposition to the agreement must remain within the\nbounds of the law. Yet as he addressed the baying mob from a hotel balcony, he\nuttered not a single word of reproach. In fact, he called Rabin’s government\n“illegitimate”, because it relied in part on the votes of Israeli Arab Knesset\nmembers.\n\nThe day of the vote, the mob descended on the Knesset. Rabin had called a\ngovernment meeting beforehand. When I got there, the crowd was so large that\nI was taken in through a special security entrance away from the front of the\nbuilding. But the Housing Minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, arrived late and\ntried to drive through the main gate. Protestors pounded furiously on his car and\ntried to break the windows. Our meeting had already begun when he arrived. He\nhad spent nearly as long as I had in the army, but he was shaken. Interrupting\nRabin, he banged his fist on the table. “I’ve been on battlefields,” he said. “I’ve\nbeen shot at. I know how to read a situation. I saw their faces. It’s insane! It is\nbeyond anything rational, this kind of hatred.” Pounding the table again, he\nshouted: “I warn you. It will end with a murder! It will end with a murder!”\nRabin motioned for calm. He, too, was concerned by the rhetorical violence,\neven more so now that it was becoming physical violence. But as he would tell\nan interviewer a few weeks later, he simply didn’t believe that “a Jew will kill a\nJew.” Nor, at that point, did I.\n\nAfter the Knesset vote, which passed by a margin of 61 to 59, plans got\nunderway for a rally in defense of the peace process, and against the tide of\nhatred on the right. It was the idea of two people: Shlomo Lahat, a Likud mayor\nof Tel Aviv who now backed Oslo, and a French Jewish businessman named\nJean Frydman, a friend of Shimon Peres whom I had got to know and like. But\nin several of the early planning discussions in which I was involved, Rabin was\nagainst the rally, which was to be held in the huge Kings of Israel Square in the\n\n2/7\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011748",
