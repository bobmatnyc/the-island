  "text": "BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH TOOLS & INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT STRATEGY\n\nNLV-III’s investment strategy in Biological Research Tools and Infrastructure will focus on\nidentifying companies that are at or near the commercial stage with novel products targeting\nestablished, high growth markets -- such as DNA sequencing and personalized medicine. The\nproducts of interest will be those based on differentiated technologies that offer higher quality\nbiological results at significant cost savings to customers than current products. The investment\ntheses for these companies will be based on rapidly building high-gross margins businesses that\nreach break-even on manageable timelines and limited capital budgets. An example of a tools\ncompany in the New Leaf portfolio is Advanced Cellular Diagnostics (NLV-II, commercial\nstage).\n\nResearch tools and infrastructure technology companies are benefiting from several positive\nhealthcare industry tailwinds. Technology advancements over the past decade, such as genomic\nsequencing and personalized diagnostics, have generated the need for additional reagents and\ninstruments to efficiently interrogate vast amounts of biological samples and process massive\nquantities of resulting data. Unlike biopharmaceutical or medical device product development,\nthese new reagents are not subject to the risks of costly clinical trials, regulatory approvals and\npayer reimbursement. Thus, timelines are more manageable and predictable, and budgets are\nmuch more capital efficient. In fact, in this sector, the Fund Managers expect to identify\nopportunities for investment in technologies that have been largely de-risked, are commercial-\nready, and can be funded to profitability on VC dollars. While substantial commercial adoption\nwill likely be required for most companies in this sector to be acquired, given the high margins,\nrapid sales adoption, and relatively low sales and marketing costs, funding the launch of a new\ntool or technology in this sector can represent an attractive risk-reward investment.\n\nThis dynamic sector is growing rapidly and small companies have been a prolific source of\ninnovative new products for the large, established companies that dominate the commercial\ndistribution channels. The Fund will approach this sector opportunistically and will invest in a\nsmall number of companies with novel and clearly differentiated products targeting sectors of\nrapid growth that are at or near the commercial stage.\n\nThe Fund Managers expect investments in this sector and the medical device sector to comprise\nup to 15% of the Fund.\n\n42 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024053",
