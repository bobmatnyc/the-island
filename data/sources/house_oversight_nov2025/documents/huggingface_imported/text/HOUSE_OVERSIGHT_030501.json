Not yet and not from Davos. As you know, Davos has had some criticism in the press for bank\nCEOs attending and I feel like it's the wrong way to go for your first interview as IB CEO. I also think print has\nmuch more impact than TV. Talk to Lionel and Robert while you're there -- they are the two guys who can\nmove the needle on this. And let's do more in print when you get back. In fact, Matt Zames and I spent an hour\nand a half with WSJ's Kate Kelly from the Journal on this issue for a major story she's doing on the Obama\nproposal. Let's have you quoted in that.\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: Jes Staley\n\nTo: Joseph Evangelist; a ; ie\nSent: Thu Jan 28 04:56:55 2010\n\nSubject:\n\nDaley and frankel are saying that I need to go on TV (CNBC) to defend our hedge funds.
