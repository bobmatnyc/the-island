>> In the summer of 2009, in a talk at the Bristol (UK) Festival of Ideas, Freeman Dyson articulated a vision for
the future. He referenced "The Age Of Wonder", by Richard Holmes, in which the first Romantic Age
described by Holmes was centered on chemistry and poetry, while Dyson pointed out that this new age is
dominated by computational biology. Its leaders, he noted, include "biology wizards" Kary Mullis, Craig
Venter, medical engineer Dean Kamen; and "computer wizards" Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Charles
Simonyi. He pointed out that the nexus for this intellectual activity — the Lunar Society for the 21st century —
is centered around the activities of EDGE.

>> Dyson continued to articulate his vision for a new age of biology ina related review inNew York Review of
Books in which he wrote: "...a new generation of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote
verses, might create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enrich the ecology of our
planet. Most of these artists would be amateurs, but they would be in close touch with science, like the poets of
the earlier Age of Wonder. The new Age of Wonder might bring together wealthy entrepreneurs like Venter
and Kamen ... and a worldwide community of gardeners and farmers and breeders, working together to make
the planet beautiful as well as fertile, hospitable to hummingbirds as well as to humans."

>> So, along these lines, who can best articulate the important issues questions we face today than the very
people who are, through their ideas and entrepreneurial zeal, changing the very nature of reality itself. Here's
the 2012 Annual Question. Before sending it out widely to the list, it's useful to seed the project with a dozen or
so interesting responses to provide examples and set a high bar. Even better, to inspire. How about it?? Hope to
hear from you. JB
