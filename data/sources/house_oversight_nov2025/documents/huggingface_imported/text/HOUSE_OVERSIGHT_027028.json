Pritzker, whose family founded the Hyatt\nhotel chain, is worth about $1.5 billion. So it's easy to see how a few million - or 80 — could go\nmissing.\n\nMaybe she left it in the other purse?\n\nA spokeswoman told Bloomberg that the $80 million was “a substantial amount\" and that Pritzker's advisers\ncorrected the error as soon as they realized it.\n\nPer Bloomberg: \"Documents released last week show Pritzker received $32.2 million for a decade's worth of\nconsulting on the restructuring of domestic trusts,\" but new filings indicated she made at least $80\nmillion more than that.\n\nMonice M.
