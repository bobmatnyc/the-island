What do you think Mr. Xi makes of\nDonald Trump?\n\nRLK: Before Trump came into office I know very specifically\nthere were various think tanks that were engaging in\nvarious scenario planning on how to deal with Trump and\nhis vicissitudes.\n\nRLK: And the conclusion was to let it play out, don’t react\nto virtually anything, and treat the U.S. just like it did in\nnormal times. And so] think that will be the approach. It'll\nbe very straight forward. China won't react to the highs or\nlows. It’ll treat the protocol at a very high level.
