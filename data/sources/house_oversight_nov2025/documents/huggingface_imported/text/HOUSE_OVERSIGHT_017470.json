  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nJumping a mugger\n\nWhen I was a young lawyer, I frequently took my kids to Boston Bruin hockey games, which\nwere rough and tumble affairs, both on the ice and in the stands. At one game, a great lawyer\nwith whom I have sometimes worked, Joe Oteri was sitting a row in front of me with his teenage\ndaughter. During a break between period, Joe went out for a beer. An older teenage guy began\nto aggressively flirt with Joe’s daughter. When Joe saw him touching his daughter in an\nunwelcome way, he grabbed him. Unbeknownst to Joe, the guy’s friend was standing in back of\nhim and raised his hand above his head about to hit Joe from behind. As soon as I saw this, I\nleaped over the seats and grabbed the guy from behind, preventing him from hitting Joe. The\nsecurity came and quickly separated us. When Joe began to tell this story to anyone who would\nlisten, it kept getting better and better. The final version had me beating up the two maulers and\nsaving his daughter’s life. Although the reality is that my heroism was quite limited and totally\ninstinctive, Joe has never forgotten what I did and has always shown his appreciation.\n\n383\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017470",
