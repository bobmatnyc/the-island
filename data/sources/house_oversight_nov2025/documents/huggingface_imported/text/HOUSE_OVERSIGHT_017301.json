The problem was that several years\nhad passed between the murder and the prosecution and Connolly had a plausible statute of\nlimitations argument on appeal.\n\nI was asked by State Attorney Rundle to consult with her appellate lawyers and to prepare them\nfor what they expected would be a grueling oral argument. I agreed and worked with them, and\nwith federal prosecutors in Boston, on the appellate brief. I also conducted a “moot court” in\nwhich I played judge and asked the hardest questions I could come up with. The “moot court,”\nas it turned out, was more grueling than the actual argument, and the prosecution won the appeal.\nIt was the first time I recall cheering when I heard that the prosecution had won an appeal.\n\nThere is nothing more corrosive to the administration of justice than corrupt law enforcement\nofficials (except, perhaps, corrupt judges, several of whom Billy Bulger had appointed to “his”\nbench). The Bulger gang is now history. Whitey and Connolly are in prison, probably for the rest\nof their lives. Billy is “retired” from politics, but still widely admired by some in Boston, who\nought to know better.\n\n214\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017301",
