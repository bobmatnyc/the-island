  "text": "per unit time. But Petty showed that the idea of human capital as discounted cash\nflow measured in a money sum allows the factors to be summed together. The\nrevival of interest at the Chicago school soon introduced the term physical capital\nfor land and man-made things that can be bought and sold, and total capital for the\nsum. Physical capital is a misnomer in that we are physical too. But I have used it\nthroughout so that economists can follow me and general readers can pick up some\n\nof their language.\n\nFrom the Y = C +1 Equation to the Y Rule\n\nChapter 2 summarized my argument adjusting the Y = C + ] equation to the Y rule.\nChapter 4 spelled out the former in (4.1). The Y rule made the hidden asterisks of\nthe Y=C +1 equation explicit. | said in both chapters that the free growth equations\n\nare the same for both when we allow for the asterisks.\n\nLet’s go through the derivation of the Y rule again. (4.1) shows\n\noutput = investment + consumption.\n\nI] generally mean the version of this where “ex post net” is understood before both\n“output” and “investment”. | said that this idea is implicit in the Mill quote, and is\nprobably as old as economics. Net output, here or anywhere, means creation of\nvalue. Then the equation would be guaranteed by the truism, at the collective scale,\nif net investment meant growth of all value existing, meaning total capital, while\nconsumption meant elimination from total capital collectively and nothing else. But\nnet ex post investment as meant throughout this book, and anywhere in macro,\nmeans growth in physical capital alone. Consumption includes Schultz’ invested\nconsumption transferred into human capital as well as his pure consumption\n\neliminated from total capital as a whole. What the truism guarantees is rather\n\noutput = total growth + pure consumption, (5.1)\n\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011024",
