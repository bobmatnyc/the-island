But if we don’t\ntake chances, we can’t win.”\n\n--Snowden in Moscow\n\nThe next evening Snowden drove to Honolulu International Airport. He left his leased car in\nthe parking lot. He took with him only carry-on baggage, including a back-pack and a laptop\nwith a TOR sticker on it. “I took everything I had on my back,” he said. Before leaving he also\npacked in his luggage the cash that would pay for his fugitive life. Along with the cash, he took\nthe thumb drives containing the NSA’s keys to the kingdom.\n\nAt this point, Snowden was still a free man. He was not wanted by the authorities. He had\nprovided his employer and the NSA with a medical excuse for his absence from work so he would\nnot be immediately missed. He also had a valid passport, a credit card, and ID. He had he yet\nmade arrangements to meet the journalists. Snowden’s destination was Hong Kong. After\ncrossing the International Date Line, Snowden waited three hours in the transit zone of Narita.\nHere he was reportedly captured by the airports CCTV cameras sitting alone. He then boarded a\nplane to Hong Kong. After the four-hour long flight from Narita, he arrived in Hong Kong early\nin the morning on May 20\".\n\nHe had visited Hong Kong at least once before with Lindsay Mills when he was stationed in\nJapan. He had also made some arrangements. According to Albert Ho, his Hong Kong Lawyer,\nSnowden stayed at a residence arranged for him in advance by a party whom Snowden knew prior\nto his arrival. This “carer,” Ho said, had assisted Snowden with his logistics. For the next ten\ndays, Snowden did not use his credit card or leave any paper trail to his location. Wherever he\nwas, “his first priority,” as he told Greenwald, was to find a place safe from US countermeasures.\nHe brought with him a large number of electronic copies of NSA documents marked “TS/SCI/\nNOFORN, which stood for Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmentalized Information and No\nForeign Distribution. According to government rules, data carrying these labels could not be\nremoved from a government-approved “SCI facility.” Yet Snowden, who brought them with him\ninto this semi-autonomous zone in China, intended to break these rules.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020244",
