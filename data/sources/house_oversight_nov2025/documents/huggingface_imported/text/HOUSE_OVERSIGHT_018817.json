  "text": "General Information 7\n\ne The age of the property makes estimates of accrued depreciation very subjective.\n\ne This approach is not typically used by market participants, except for new properties.\n\nResearch and Analysis\n\nThe type and extent of our research and analysis is detailed in individual sections of the report. This\nincludes the steps we took to verify comparable sales, which are disclosed in the comparable sale\nprofile sheets in the addenda to the report. Although we make an effort to confirm the arms-length\nnature of each sale with a party to the transaction, it is sometimes necessary to rely on secondary\nverification from sources deemed reliable.\n\nInspection\n\nMark J. Weathers conducted an interior and exterior inspection of the property on November 25,\n2015. James V. Andrews, MAI, CRE, FRICS, ASA, CVA, also conducted an interior and exterior\ninspection on November 25, 2015.\n\nIGY American Yacht Harbor Marina\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018817",
