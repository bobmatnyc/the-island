  "text": "If the company didn't agree, Avenatti threatened an immediate press conference amid the\nNCAA basketball tournament about Nike making payments to youth players and their\nfamilies, prosecutors said, an event he promised would snowball into more bad press and\npeople coming forward with claims of recruiting malfeasance.\n\nIn a recorded phone call, Avenatti told Nike attorneys that if the company tried to\nnegotiate a cap on the investigation fees, he would go public and \"take a billion dollars off\nyour client's market cap,\" according to the complaint. At a March 21 meeting in New\nYork, Avenatti allegedly continued to wield threats and press for the investigator role, at\none point asking Nike attorneys if they'd ever had \"the balls of a client in [their] hands.\"\n\n\"Michael Avenatti may be the best lawyer in the world, according to Michael Avenatti, but\nthere are appropriate courses of conduct to address an alleged wrongdoing, and I don't\nsee how a demand of, 'Give me a job and pay me $12 million,' is ever going to make the\nclient whole,\" Saland said.\n\nAdam Felsenstein, a white collar defense specialist at Gallet Dreyer & Berkey LLP, called\nthe prosecutor's narrative \"very extortive,\" particularly on the allegation regarding\nAvenatti's demand to be hired directly by the company. If that element of the charges is\nwell-founded, it would effectively leave Avenatti without a \"cloak of legitimacy\" that he\nwas acting solely to resolve a dispute on behalf of his client.\n\nThe complaint \"doesn't even refer to anticipated litigation. It's just, 'I'm going to reveal\nembarrassing information unless you pay me.' And once you start asking for money for\nyourself like that, you trend into extortion,\" Felsenstein said.\n\nBarry Temkin of Mound Cotton Wollan & Greengrass LLP similarly characterized the\nalleged scheme as \"brazen,\" and voiced doubt Avenatti would be able to argue that he\ncould pressure Nike to hire him as an investigator and stay within the legal lines.\n\n\"He's going to them with a demand that they hire him even as he's threatening them with\nthis press conference, which is screwed up on a lot of levels,\" he said. \"It's ambulance\nchasing, which is unethical. It's a conflict of interest, and who would want to hire someone\nto do an internal investigation who is also shaking them down?\"\n\nAvenatti was arrested Monday just after he announced via Twitter an impending press\nconference about a \"major high school/college basketball scandal\" and criminal conduct\n\"at the highest levels of Nike.\"\n\nIn an unrelated action, federal officials in California charged Avenatti on Monday with\ndefrauding a client out of a $1.6 million settlement and lying to a Mississippi bank to\n\nsecure loans for his firm and a coffee business.\n\nAvenatti was released in New York later in the day after posting a $300,000 bond. He is\ndue in court on the California case on Monday. He did not respond to multiple requests\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031777",
