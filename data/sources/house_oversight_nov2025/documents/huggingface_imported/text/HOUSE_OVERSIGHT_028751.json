  "text": "TB: You could say we were supporting the democracy element in Cairo’s\nTahrir Square. Were we not?\n\nDP: Yes and rightly so. The initial demonstrations of early 2011 were\nspearheaded by the liberals and seculars who deserve U.S. support. But\nthey got quickly pushed aside and Washington barely paid them further\nattention.\n\nTB: We gave foreign aid to Mubarak. Was that a bad idea?\n\nDP: That aid dates back to the utterly different circumstances of the\nEgypt-Israel peace treaty of 1979 and became progressively more wrong-\nheaded. It should long ago have been discontinued. More broadly, I\nbelieve in aid for emergencies (soup and blankets) and as a bribe, but not\nfor economic development. That the Obama administration is\ncontemplating aid, including military hardware, to the Morsi government\noutrages me.\n\nes\nne\n\ni\n\nClick here to Reply or Forward\n\n22.2 GB (10%) of 210.1 GBManage\n©2013 Google - Terms & Privacy\nLast account activity: 0 minutes ago\nDetails\n\nBS Df DIS 2S DIS Ig OIC BIS DIS 2S ik DIS IC 24C BIS DIS 54S 2k DIS ig DIC BIS DIS DIC 2k DIC Ig 24S BIC DIS 3S DC DIC Ok DIC BIS DIC SIC 2g DIC 2g 24C IS OIC 51S Df DIC 2k 24K IS 2IK 2S 2fe DIC 2k OIC Ik 2k 2k\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\n\nthe use of the addressee.
