This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions.\nPresumably, she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business.\n\nEpstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin.\n\nVirginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had\nshown her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter.\n\nVirginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. ‘My face was red with\nembarrassment,’ she says. ‘But | felt under immense pressure to please them.\n\nThe whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I'd travel with Jeffrey on his\nprivate jet and have a well-paid profession.’ Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to\nreturn the next day.\n\nThat was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein.\nFor three of those years, she was under Florida’s age of consent, which is 18.\n\nCase 1:1 5°CHOVGSGRWVS7.
