By & quot;them\" I mean\nthose who have allegiance to a socio-political system disguised as a religion that seeks world dominance by\nman imposed methodology/effort -- unlike Judaism and Christianity properly understood. If we are to\n\"believe\", the world already has a King and does not need a Caliph.\n\nReport\nReply\n0\n\nos\n\nMikeWood - 6 hours ago\n\nGround-breaking, brilliant. There are absolutely essentially lessons to be learned from this. Buy this book, read\nit, study it, and lend it to your friends and colleagues. Do it.\n\nReport\nReply\n0\n\na\n\nlambsev77 54p - 4 hours ago\nThe fall of Rome... The fall of the 3rd Reich... The fall of Western Civilization...\n\noooooh...

Mia farrow has no clue what the right to bear arms means and because of\nthat she needs to shut the hell up. As far as blacks go-- I grew up in the 70's coming home from Hallahan H.S.\nin Philadel phia, me and my small group of girls were swarmed by a mob of black girls who would kick and\nslap and pull hair without provocation. of course we would fight back but then that was back in the day when\nwhites weren't sissies. Still I made excuses for them. Black men would get in my face for no other reason than\nto intimidate me. rocks were thrown a my car for no reason. So, in short, based on my experiences Blacks are\nthe cause of racism and if they hate whites so much then they should stay away completely and totally. _\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024404",
