  "text": "oS\n\nDOJ also opposes subsection (b). Since the passage of the TVPA, DOJ has been one of\nthe principal agencies conducting trainings for a multitude of audiences, including task forces\nand Federal, state, and local law enforcement, on the issue of trafficking in persons. The\nDepartment also has experience in conducting training on juvenile victims through the Innocence\nLost National Initiative. Effective efforts to combat trafficking must mobilize the expertise of\nHAS, DHS, and DOJ.\n\nDOJ also notes a misspelling in the new subsection (F)(ii)— “edibility” instead of\n“eligibility”.\n\n16. Section 214\n\nSection 214 of the bill authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to assist victims of\nsevere forms of trafficking up to $2.5 million in 2008, increasing to $15 million in 2011. The\nDepartment of Justice already has authority to make grants for the provision of services for crime\nvictims and does so at a level in excess of $250 million a year. Also, the authorization of yet\nanother grant program runs counter to the Administration’s proposal in the 2008 Budget to\nconsolidate DOJ’s more than 70 grant programs,\n\nMoreover, any provision purporting to expand or alter definitions of individuals of\nqualifying for victim benefits must include the requirement that a Federal law enforcement agent\nmust declare the individual to be a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, and that the\nvictim agree to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution, or that the victim be under the age\nof 18,\n\nDOJ opposes the consultation requirement in subsection (a}(1) with the Secretary of State\nfor establishing programs to serve domestic, U.S. citizen trafficking victims. Such domestic\nauthority falls outside of the mission and expertise of the Department of State. DOJ also opposes\nthe mandatory consultation with non-government organizations (NGOs) regarding the provision\nof services, This creates a conflict of interest since many of the NGOs will apply for and could\nreceive grants under the program. Finally, any section regarding the provision of victim services\nmust also contain language that includes organizations that provide services to “juveniles\nsubjected to trafficking, as defined in section 203(g) of the Trafficking Victims Protection\nReauthorization Act of 2005,” which would ensure that the funds authorized to the Attorney\nGeneral for establishment of grants will go toward the work and development of the Innocence\nLost Task Forces.\n\nDOJ opposes subsection (b) because it provides Victims of Crime Act of 1984 funds to\nprostitutes implicated in violations of the Mann Act (criminalizing transportation of prostitutes in\ninterstate commerce), Such persons do not meet the legal definition of “victim” as that term is\ndefined in the law, unless the person prostituted is under the age of 18 at the time the crime was\ncommitted or the petson, through the application of another Federal statute or regulation,\nsatisfies the legal definition of a victim. Such persons are already eligibie under the Crime\nVictims Fund Act to receive benefits.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012378",
