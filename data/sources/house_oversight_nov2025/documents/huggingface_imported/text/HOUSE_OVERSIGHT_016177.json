  "text": "Metals & Mining: ambitious growth target\n\nFaisal AlAzmeh, CFA >>\nMerrill Lynch KSA Company\nfaisal.alazmeh@baml.com\n\nThe NTP has focused on several areas relating to domestic drivers, i.e., housing, retail,\ntrade and finance. However, a core part of the Saudi government’s transformation\nstrategy is to focus on expanding the Kingdom’s mining potential. Saudi Maaden has\nhistorically been Saudi’s mining champion, but the mining sector currently contributes\nonly around 2% to the Kingdom’s GDP. The NTP has set a high target for the sector: its\ncontribution to GDP growing by 50% to SAR97bn by 2020 and sector employment\nincreasing by 40% to 90k. While the first target could be achieved given the amount of\ncapital that is currently being deployed in the sector, the latter part is questionable in\nour view as capital intensive projects are not the best means for employment\ngeneration.\n\nGovernment focus on mining to boost jobs and growth\n\nThe focus on mining is driven by the ample and growing resources available. The\nKingdom’s largest mined products are phosphates, bauxite and gold. It supplies around\n8% of global DAP production and has the largest integrated aluminium company in the\nworld. Ma’aden continues to discover new gold and copper sites as well. We believe the\noutlook for mining is encouraging and the contribution to GDP targeted by the\ngovernment could be achieved. We believe investments in this sector faces two hurdles:\n\n1. Diversification — the base metal cycle lags that of oil but is eventually driven by the\nsame global drivers (global growth). Furthermore, the NTP has currently set a low\nnumber for its capital commitments to the industry (USS82mn), achieving the\ntargeted diversification and job creation at the moment seems to be highly\ndependent on attracting private sector capital. This would require attractive\nincentives schemes such as energy subsidies, tax exemptions or ease of issuing\nwork permits for expats. However, at the moment, these have not been addressed\nby the Saudi authorities.\n\n2. High capital intensity — for example, the government has spent close to US$21bn\non Saudi Maaden but the company employs only around 6,000 permanent workers,\nof which Saudis account for nearly a third. While the build-up of this capacity does\ncreate a multiplier effect of almost 10x during the construction phase, most of the\nadded jobs are usually low income blue-collar jobs that tend not to attract Saudis.\n\nDomestic services sectors create more jobs than mining for dollars spent\n\nWe argue that capital spent on domestic services sectors is likely to yield more\nemployment for dollars spent. A key example is Saptco, the Saudi Public transport\nCompany, which has spent around US$450mn on assets and currently employs around\nthe same number of permanent employees as Maaden, of which 1,200 are Saudis. We\nacknowledge that the technology and technical transfer will be different in an\ninvestment like Maaden versus Saptco, yet we believe the economic efficiency of using\nthe mining sector as a means of generating employment is questionable.\n\nNTP is already happening: Saudi Aramco has project to create 2,000 jobs\n\nThe plan to develop the mining industry is moving forward. Saudi Aramco has already\nannounced its plans to build a downstream industrial complex along with GE and\nCividale SpA. The complex will include the first-of-its-kind high-end forging & casting\nmanufacturing facility and will serve the region’s maritime and energy industries. The\nproject will cost around US$400mn and likely generate around 2,000 jobs.\n\nOS Merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 67\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016177",
