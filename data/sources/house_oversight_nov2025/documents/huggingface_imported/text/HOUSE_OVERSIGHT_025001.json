  "text": "Turkey to explain and justify its stance towards Israel. Now Turkey\nwill have to try much harder to promote its position to the world in\nthe absence of such support. However, this does not necessarily mean\nthat Turkey's decision to impose sanctions against Israel is wrong.\nAny other decision would have meant Turkey was bowing to Israel's\ndemands.\n\nThe report certainly undermined Turkey's position, but overall, things\nare not so bad in its aftermath. The policy Turkey has pursued since\nthe Mavi Marmara incident has served its interests so far. The report\ncould have sealed the process. The presidential statement made at the\nUN Security Council immediately after the incident as well as the UN\nHuman Rights Council's decision finding the Gaza blockade illegal\nand Israel the culprit should be revisited. Turkey expected that this\nlast UN report would complete the circle and drive Israel into a\ncorner. But contrary to expectations, the report made some room for\nIsrael to maneuver and took an opportunity away from Turkey.\n\nDr. Cenap Cakmak is the head of the department of international\nrelations at Eskisehir Osmangazi University.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025001",
