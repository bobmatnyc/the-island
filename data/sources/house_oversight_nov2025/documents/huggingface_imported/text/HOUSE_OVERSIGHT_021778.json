  "text": "So maybe Mr. Epstein is satisfied that he's getting his money's worth from his large\nlegal team, which includes Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz\n(remember O.J. Simpson?) and Kenneth Starr (remember Monica Lewinsky?). Jack\nGoldberger of West Palm Beach, who's also on the team, told Post columnist Jose\nLambiet in November: \"This case is absolutely going to end without a trial within\nthe next two months.”\n\nHe was wrong, but Mr. Goldberger remains on Mr. Epstein's payroll, feigning\nmoral outrage at two lawsuits filed this year against the Manhattan money\nmanager. The lawsuits allege sexual exploitation of teenaged girls, one of\nthem as young as 14. Said Mr. Goldberger after the first lawsuit, seeking\nmore than $50 million, was filed on Jan. 24: \"We think this shows what this\ncase is all about: money.” Yes, it is - Mr. Epstein's effort to buy his way out\nof prosecution.\n\nAccording to the lawyer of a 17-year-old whose parents are suing him, Mr. Epstein\n\nmasturbated in front of her (she was 14 at the time) and used a vibrator on her at his\nhome in February 2005. Another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez dismissed it:\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein did not have sex with this woman.\"\n\nFor those girls who claim that he did, Mr. Epstein's lawyers maintain that he did not\nknow their ages, despite a police search of his home and garbage that found phone\nmessages about the girls' school schedules and even a high school transcript. For all of\nhis money, Mr. Epstein's best defense remains \"I didn't know that I was a criminal\npervert\"?\n\nPalm Beach Post Editorial #4\n\nRich man fought the law and he mostly won\nPalm Beach Post Editorial\n\nMonday, July 07, 2008\n\nTwo years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of\nprostitution, Jeffrey Epstein finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5\nmillion, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for sex. A week ago, the 55-yearold\ninvestment banker began serving 18 months in jail.\n\nBut that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a\n\nperson under the age of 18 for prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls,\n\none as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually abused them. And why is Epstein\nserving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state prison, where\ninmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year?\n\nThe slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public\n\nPost your that there's a different system of justice for the wealthy who hire high-\ncomments powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense\non this attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021778",
