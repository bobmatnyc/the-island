  "text": "/ BARAK / 117\n\nreactor near Baghdad, there was never any question that we would take any and all\npossible measures to prevent Syria from getting a nuclear weapon. An immutable,\ncore assumption in Israel’s security strategy was the need to retain our ability to\ndeter, and if necessary defeat, our enemies. A nuclear Syria — or Iraq, or Iran —\nwould dramatically alter the balance of power in the region, at obvious risk to\nIsrael. Syria posed a particular threat, as part of an increasingly close alliance with\nIran, and with Hizbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe question, however, was how and when to strike the reactor. Olmert wanted\nto attack within days. He seemed to assume that, as a former chief of staff, ’'d nod\nenthusiastically and go along with him. I did understand the reasons for his sense\nof urgency. Not only did we have to make sure we attacked before the fuel was on\nsite. There was always the risk the Syrians would find out that we were aware of\ntheir nuclear facility, putting them on even higher alert. But the operational\nchallenge was complex. We need a fail-safe plan to destroy the reactor. We had to\ndo it in such a way as to avoid a full-scale military confrontation with Syria if\npossible. And we had to ensure we were ready for that, if it did happen. It took\nvery little time for me to realize that none of those prerequisites was yet in place.\nNot unlike the recent Lebanon war, we were choosing between two off-the-shelf\nplans from the kirya. One involved using a large military force, and would almost\ncertainly draw us into a major conflict with Syria. The other was a smaller,\ntargeted operation. But it remained untested, and there was no certainty it would\nactually destroy the reactor.\n\nOver the next few months, Olmert got more and more frustrated with the fact\nwe hadn’t yet attacked, and frustrated with me as well. We held dozens of\nmeetings, sometimes two or three a day, chaired by the Prime Minister, sometimes\nby me as Defense Minister, or by the chief of staff or service commanders.\nInvariably, I began my remarks by saying: “We have to destroy the reactor.” This\nwas not because I felt that any of us seriously doubted that. It was because Olmert\nwas beginning to suggest to the few ministers and senior officers aware of our\nplanning that I was against attacking the reactor. In fact, I was working with the\nmilitary and Mossad to ensure we had a plan that would succeed, with the\nminimum possible risk of drawing us into a major clash with the Syrians after the\nfacility was destroyed. I was also working — with the help of the Americans — to\nmake sure we could get the forces and munitions in place in the north of Israel to\n\n403\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011874",
