On the basis of my commitment merely to try for peace, Arik Sharon had\npresented a no-confidence motion in the Knesset. It was never going to pass. But\nonly days after I’d made him Interior Minister, Natan Sharansky let it be known he\nwas going to vote against us. He didn’t. He stayed away from the chamber, in\neffect abstaining. But I’d been put on notice.\n\nI did lose my first coalition partner in September: the small United Torah\nJudaism party, with five Knesset seats. It wasn’t over land-for-peace. In an echo of\na similar crisis that brought down the government during Rabin’s first spell as\nPrime Minister in the 1970s, it was over a violation of the Jewish Sabbath. It\nturned out that Israel’s state electric company had been transporting a huge steam-\ncondensation machine from the manufacturing site near Haifa to a power plant in\nAshdod. The unit was the size of a small apartment. It weighed 100 tons. It\ncouldn’t be driven across the country without bringing weekday traffic to a\nstandstill. The obvious solution was to do it when road use was lightest, on\nShabbat. Precisely the same procedure had been followed — 24 times — under Bibi.\nBut when I asked a United Torah Judaism leader why he’d seemed happy when\nLikud had waved it through, he replied: “Past sins cannot pardon future ones.” Eli\nSuissa, one of the Shas ministers in the cabinet, took his side, saying: “Every hour\nis good for the keeping of Shabbat.” Most other ministers agreed with me that we\nshould stand firm. So I did. But UTJ walked out of the government. Shas did\nremain. But I was now increasingly certain that at some stage its ministers, too,\nwould leave.\n\nIn the midst of the Sharanksy rebellion, Haim Ramon, who was the minister in\ncharge of liaising with the Knesset, insisted I “punish” him for his political\ngrandstanding. “You should fire Sharansky. Act like a leader!” I just laughed. ‘““The\ncoalition doesn’t need a leader,” I replied. “It needs therapy.” In truth, I suspected\nthat if we ever got near to a peace agreement with Assad or Arafat, even therapy\nmight not help. But that was a main reason that I’d promised a referendum on any\nfinal peace deals. I believed that in the choice between concessions, even painful\nones, and a genuine peace deal with Syria or the Palestinians, by far most Israelis\nwould choose peace.\n\nI relied on a strong, close team around me, people I knew well and who shared\nmy determination to stay focused on the central goal: to put Israel in a position\nwhere its citizens could be given that choice.
