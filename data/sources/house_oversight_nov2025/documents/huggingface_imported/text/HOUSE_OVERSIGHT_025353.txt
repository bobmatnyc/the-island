Honorable Mark Filip

Office of the Deputy Attorney General
United States Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C, 20530

Dear Judge Filip: |

In his confirmation hearings last fall, Judge Mukasey admirably lifted up the finest
traditions of the Department of Justice in assuring the United States Senate, and the American
people, of his solemn intent to ensure fairness and integrity in the administration of justice, Your
own confirmation hearings echoed that bedrock determination to assure that the Department
conduct itself with honor and integrity, especially in the enforcement of federai criminal law.

We come to you in that spirit and respectfully ask for a review of the federal involvement
in a quintessentially state matter involving our client, Jeffrey Epstein. While we are well aware
of the rare instances in which a review of this sort is justified, we are confident that the
circumstances at issue warrant such an examination. Based on our collective experiences, as
well as those of other former senior Justice Department officials whose advice we have sought,
we have never before seen a case more appropriate for oversight and review. Thus, while neither
of us has previously made such a request, we do so now in the recognition that both the
Department’s reputation, as well as the due process rights of our client, are at issue.

Recently, the Criminal Division concluded a very limited review of this matter at the
' request of U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta. Critically, however, this review deliberately excluded
many important aspects of this case. Just this past Friday, on May 16, 2008, we received a letter
from the head of CEOS informing us that CEOS had conducted a review of this case. By its own
admission, the CEOS review was “limited, both factually and legally.” Part of the self-imposed
limitation was CEOS’s abstention from addressing our “allegations of professional misconduct
by federal prosecutors’—even though such misconduct was, as we contend it is, inextricably
intertwined with the credibility of the accusations being made against Mr. Epstein by the United
States Attorney’s Office in Miami (““USAO”). Moreover, CEOS did not assess the terms of the
Deferred Prosecution Agreement now in effect, nor did CEOS review the federal prosecutors’
inappropriate efforts to implement those terms. We detail this point below.
