  "text": "Kittens & Gorillas 159\n\nUnfortunately, it turns out the AIDS virus can even mutate its functional\nparts, but this is harder. The probability of a successful functional\nmutation is 1000 times less likely than a simple aesthetic mutation to the\nsugar coat.\n\nTriple drug therapy works by attacking three different functional\nelements of the virus simultaneously. It is possible for the virus to modify\nall these functional elements but the likelihood of it doing so is tiny.\nOne mutation alone does not help because the drug cocktail will still\ntarget the other two elements and kill the virus. The AIDS virus does not\nunderstand that it is facing a triple drug cocktail. It cannot reason like a\nsentient being and random chance is not sufficient to make the big leap\nnecessary to overcome the cocktail of drugs. Unless you can mutate all\nthree elements at once your time as a virus particle on this planet is over.\nMost problems we have to solve in this world require more than one\nsimultaneous logical step and these don't happen by chance.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015849",
