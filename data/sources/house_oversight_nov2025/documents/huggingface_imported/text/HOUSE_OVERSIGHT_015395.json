  "text": "‘How long you been knowin’ him?’ and | told him, ‘All through the\nsixties,’ you know. And | said it was a fantastic idea.”\n\nFor the New Year, Flynt flew Gregory and me to the Bahamas.\nGregory was in the kitchen, diligently preparing a health drink for Flynt —\nthis must have been the birth of his Bahamian Diet powder -— and he was\nalso feeding unfiltered conspiracy theories to his eager student.\n\nAt midnight, we all went out on the dock and stood in a misty\ndrizzle as Gregory uttered truly eloquent prayers for each of us. When he\nfinished, Flynt’ s wife Althea whined, like Lucy in the Peanuts strip, “My\nhair's getting all wet.” It was her way of saying “Amen.”\n\nOn New Year's Day, we were sitting in the sand, just relaxing. Flynt\nhad bought a paperback novel by Gore Vidal in the hotel store, but first he\nwas reading the Sunday New York Times and worrying about the\nimplications of juries with only six members. A moment later he was\nrubbing suntan lotion on my back.\n\n“I'll bet Hugh Hefner never did this for you,” he said.\nkoe OF\n\nLarry Flynt had been traveling around a lot, but he happened to be\nback in L.A. at the same time that my friend LSD guru Ram Dass was\n\nvisiting, so | had the unique pleasure of introducing them. Larry, Althea,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015395",
