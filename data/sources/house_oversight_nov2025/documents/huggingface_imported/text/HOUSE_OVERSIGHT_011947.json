  "text": "That Gorgeous Underage Model May Be A\nSlave: Regulation For Agencies To Stop Child\nSex Trafficking\n\nFirst came the knowledge that slaves still existed and were present in larger numbers than ever\nbefore. Then the realization that a human being could be purchased within a few hours of my\nhome for under $100. Now only a few miles away. In the following years I’ve been learning the\nmyriad forms, places and types of slavery. The list keeps lengthening and with each new form\n(to me), learn about , it knocks me down, one more time.\n\nSlavery\n\nDebt Bondage\nSexual Slavery\nChild Brides\n\nForced Labor\n\nChild Soldiers\nAdoption Trafficking\nOrgan Trafficking\nTrafficked Athletes\n\nAnd now a new one I should have seen coming,\n\nThose very young, foreign models you see? Some of them were trafficked by model scouts who\nliterally trawled through some of the most destitute and vulnerable people on earth for them. The\nsame methods as other predatory traffickers; Go to politically or economically unstable areas,\nlocate 5'11”\" beautiful young girls; buy them, import them, own them, use them.\n\nHorrible irony to have images that portray us to the world possibly be of slaves.\n\nit’s hard to think of an area of our society that doesn't admire seeing it’s most vaunted members\nwith a model on their arm. While this observation does not imply that those people were\ntrafficked, imagine how simple that makes it to approach a child or it's family anywhere in the\nworld and offer them this in return for absolute control.\n\nAll the traffickers have to do is pull out a magazine or phone with videos on it.\n\nI'm not shocked at traffickers using this method of promises to lure unsuspecting girls into\nslavery, I've seen it, read about it, studied it. I’m in shock that it flourishes in the most visible,\n\n36\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011947",
