  "text": "Later in the decade, my mother dumped one of her boyfriends. He then came to her\napartment one night, broke in, and raped her. As he got in bed, she was in the middle of a\nflashback. She cried and said \"No,\" and he had sex with her anyway. When she tried to\ntell him later that what he'd done was unacceptable, he informed her that because she'd\npursued him during their relationship -- because she was the one who originally asked\nhim out -- a rape case would never stand up in court.\n\nMy mother met my dad many years after these incidents. Mom first told me that she'd\nbeen raped in my late teens, because she was considering telling her story to our church\ncongregation, and she wanted me to know before she did that. The full stories came out\nduring intermittent conversations in my twenties. I love both my parents with the fire of a\nthousand suns, and let me tell you, I've spent an unreasonable amount of time fantasizing\nabout murdering the men who attacked my mother. I doubt I could find the first guy, but I\ncould probably find the second, and in my early twenties I often imagined shooting him\nin the head. (Don't worry, Mom, I don't think about that anymore.)\n\nWithin the last few years, I started thinking about asking Mom's permission to write\nabout her experiences and my reaction to them. I always shelved the idea because I felt\nthat it wasn't my story to tell. Last year, the topic came up in conversation, and I finally\nasked permission; she said yes immediately. I double-checked her consent twice this\nyear, and she said yes both times. Still, I was hesitant, and I only got around to it now --\nfor Mother's Day. I also asked her to review this piece, and to feel free to veto anything\nwithin it.\n\nI am doing my best not to co-opt or appropriate my mother's story. But her story and her\nlife have shaped mine, intimately -- including my views on gender issues, and my course\nas a feminist activist and writer. A few years ago, a widely-read Harper's article by\nestablished feminist Susan Faludi asserted that the relationship between younger\nfeminists and older feminists is like a battle between girls and our moms. I read the\narticle with interest, but also with a sense of displacement. As a teenager I fought with\nmy mom all the time, but she and I rarely argue anymore, and we never argue about\nissues of feminism or sexuality at all. If \"young\" feminism is about rebelling against our\nmothers, then I missed that boat completely.\n\nIn fairness, my mom's not easy to rebel against. When I was 15, I asked her what she'd do\nif Iran off with a Hell's Angel. She laughed. \"I'd probably be jealous,\" she said.\n\nte Kk ok\n\nI started blogging in 2008 because I wanted to write about sexuality, particularly S&M.\nHowever, I identified myself as a feminist from the start, because I wanted to make it\nobvious that S&M and feminism are not mutually exclusive. The conflicts of feminism\nand S&M have been a major theme throughout the Feminist Sex Wars. I tend to repeat\nmyself when I write about this, so I'll just mention my favorite quotation on the matter; it\ncomes from the German radical feminist Alice Schwarzer, who said, \"Female masochism\nis collaboration!\"\n\nWhen I came out of the closet to my mom, I had been freaking out about my S&M\nidentity for a while -- but quietly. I told my parents about my sexuality because I wanted\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018678",
