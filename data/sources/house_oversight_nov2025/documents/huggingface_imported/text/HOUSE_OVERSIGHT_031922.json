  "text": "10\n\nThe matter goes beyond Hamas. The Syrian regime is currently\nfighting for its life against its majority Sunni population. It has\nsurvived thus far, but it needs to redefine the conflict. The Iranians\nand Hezbollah are among those most concerned with the fall of the\nSyrian regime. Syria has been Iran's one significant ally, one\nstrategically positioned to enhance Iranian influence in the Levant. Its\nfall would be a strategic setback for Iran at a time when Tehran is\nlooking to enhance its position with the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.\nIran, which sees the uprising as engineered by its enemies - the\nUnited States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - understandably wants al\nAssad to survive.\n\nMeanwhile, the fall of Syria would leave Hezbollah - which is highly\ndependent on the current Syrian regime and is in large part an\nextension of Syrian policy in Lebanon - wholly dependent on Iran.\nAnd Iran without its Syrian ally is very far away from Hezbollah.\nLike Tehran, Hezbollah thus also wants al Assad to survive.\nHezbollah joining Hamas in a confrontation with Israel would take\nthe focus off the al Assad regime and portray his opponents as\nundermining resistance to Israel. Joining a war with Israel also would\nmake it easier for Hezbollah to weather the fall of al Assad should his\nopponents prevail. It would help Hezbollah create a moral foundation\nfor itself independent of Syria. Hezbollah's ability to force a draw\nwith Israel in 2006 constituted a victory for the radical Islamist group\nthat increased its credibility dramatically.\n\nThe 2006 military confrontation was also a victory for Damascus, as\nit showed the Islamic world that Syria was the only nation-state\nsupporting effective resistance to Israel. It also showed Israel and the\nUnited States that Syria alone could control Hezbollah and that\nforcing Syria out of Lebanon was a strategic error on the part of Israel\nand the United States.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031922",
