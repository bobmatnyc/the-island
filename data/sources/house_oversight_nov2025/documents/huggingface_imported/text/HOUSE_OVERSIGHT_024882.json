Our data shows that Personal Care Products and Vitamins & Supplements were\nmore likely to be purchased (vs. the average across all categories) by both Prime and\nNon-Prime members throughout 2018.\n\nTaking a closer look at 4018, in each month (on average) 19% of all Amazon Prime\nPurchasers bought at least one personal care product and 15% purchased a Vitamin or\nSupplement, while the average purchase rate across all 30+ categories was only 12% of\nPrime purchasers. We noted a similar trend among Non-Prime Purchasers in 4Q18, with\n13% who bought Personal Care Products and 10% who bought Vitamin or Supplements,\ncompared to the average purchase rate across all categories of 8%.\n\nFigure 111 Non-Prime Purchaser % By Vertical, 1018-4Q18\n\n25% 23%\n\n21%\n\n20%\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0%\n\n22%\n\n16%\n\n1018\n\nPersonal Care Products mi Vitamins & Supplements\n\nSource: Cowen proprietary Consumer Internet Survey, n=~2500, Dec ‘18\n\n66\n\n19% 14% a 12% 1 a\n12% 11%\n10%\n8% 7%\n6%\nA%\n2%\n0%\n4Q18 1918 2Q18 3Q18 4Q18\nAverage Across All Categories Personal Care Products mVitamins &Supplements DAverage Across All Categories\nSource: Cowen proprietary Consumer Internet Survey, n=~2500, Dec ‘18\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024882",
