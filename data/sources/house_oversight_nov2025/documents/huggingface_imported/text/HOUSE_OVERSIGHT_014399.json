Risk is diplomacy, protectionism, and\nUS economic cycle\n\nFULL REPORT\n\nBullish equities 2017; rotation into cyclicals, banks, insurance\n\nWe are bullish Japan equities for 2017 and we estimate the Nikkei 225 index will recover to 20,000 by end-\n2017 (see $/¥'s eventual surge: Buy Nikkei 06 September 2016). Our new Chief Japan Economist Izumi\nDevalier forecasts above-consensus Japan GDP growth and inflation in 2017, which is also supportive of our\nbullish equities scenario (see Ready for ignition 18 November 2016). We expect rotation into cyclicals, banks\nand insurance as explained below.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014399",
