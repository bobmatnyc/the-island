The intensity and locus of\nthese consequences would depend on the outcome of the attack and\nconflict, but there would be “battle damage” in all domains. Short-\nterm consequences would likely include a tense and unstable military\nsituation (unless the conflict ended cleanly) that would require the\ncommitment of forces for monitoring and reacting to emergent\nthreats; and also a potential political crisis in the region propelled by\ninstability and uncertainty about the future, including residual Iranian\ncapabilities to retaliate directly or indirectly.16 The oil market would\nremain in shock for some time after an attack. Naval mines, wartime\ndamage to facilities and irregular attacks on facilities or tankers\nwould see to that. Social turmoil would be likely as various\npopulation groups react to the attack and subsequent conflict. In\nshort, there would be no bright line ending the war in the economic,\ndiplomatic and social realms.\n\nTo turn to the long-term consequences, Iran would almost certainly\nremain a major player in its region. Its adjustment to the war and its\noutcome would have a major role in shaping regional realities. A\nbeaten, humiliated but still defiant Iran with essentially the same\npolitical system and approach to the region and the world would be a\nlong-term, growing danger similar to Iraq after the First Gulf War (or\nGermany after World War I). This would extend beyond the military\nto include dangers in the other domains.\n\nThe first conclusion we should draw from this exercise is that the\nU.S. government should be prepared for a long and difficult conflict\nif it ultimately decides it must attack Iran. An attack might end\nquickly with few complications if Iran acts “rationally.”” We may not\nlike what that means, however: One “rational” ending for the Iranians\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018116",
