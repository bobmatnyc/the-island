  "text": "228 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nIf there were, you could just write a program to sequentially present\nevery problem to the arbitrary problem solver and you would have\nsolved everything.\n\nThis presents us with a puzzle. A huge software industry has\ngrown up based on Turing’s ideas, employing tens of millions of people\nworldwide. This industry regularly solves all manner of problems.\nThe proof from Turing’s original 1936 paper suggests there should be\nquite strict limits on the power of computers. In the next chapter, we\nwill examine this industry and take a look at Turing’s theorem from a\nmodern view point. The chapter can be read as a stand alone article but\nwas originally written as an integral part of this book.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015918",
