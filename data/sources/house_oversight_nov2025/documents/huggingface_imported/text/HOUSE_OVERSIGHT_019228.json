  "text": "Honorable Mark Filip\nMay 19, 2008\nPage 5\n\nIn fact, recent testimony of several alleged “victims” contradicts claims made by federal\nprosecutors during the negotiations of a deferred prosecution agreement. The consistent\n\nrepresentations of key Government witnesses (such as\neR confirm the following critical points: First, there was no\n\ncommunication, telephonic or otherwise, that meets the requirements of § 2422(b). For instance,\nMs. RRR confirmed that Mr. Epstein never emailed, text-messaged, or used any facility of\ninterstate commerce whatsoever, before or after her one (and only) visit to his home. a\nTr. (deposition) at 30. Second, the women who testified admitted that they lied to Mr. Epstein\nabout their age in order to gain admittance into his home. Indeed, the women who brought their\nunderage friends to Mr. Epstein testified that they would counsel their friends to lie about their\nages as well. Ms. [BBM stated the following: “I would tell my girlfriends just like\napproached me. Make sure you tell him you’re 18. Well, these girls that I brought, I know that\nthey were 18 or 19 or 20. And the girls that I didn’t know and I don’t know if they were lying or\nnot, I would say make sure that you tell him you’re 18.” JN Tr. at 22. Third, there was no\nroutine or habit of improper communication expressing an intent to transform a massage into an\nillegal sexual act. In fact, there was often no sexual activity at all during the massage. Ms.\n\ntestified that “[s]ometimes [Mr. Epstein] just wanted his feet massaged. Sometimes he\njust wanted a back massage.” FE Tr. at 19. EE also stated that Mr. Epstein\n“never touched [her] physically” and that all she did was “massage[ ] his back, his chest and his\nthighs and that was it.” Tr. at 12-13. Finally, there was no force, coercion, fraud,\nviolence, drugs, or even alcohol present in connection with Mr. Epstein’s encounters with these\nwomen. Ms. stated that “[Mr. Epstein] never tried to force me to do anything.” [J Tr.\nA at 12. These accounts are far from the usual testimony in sex slavery, Internet stings and sex\ntourism cases previously brought. The women in actuality were not younger than 16, which is\nthe age of consent in most of the 50 states, and the sex activity was irregular and in large part,\nconsisted of solo self-pleasuring.\n\nThe recent crop of civil suits brought against Mr. Epstein confirm that the plaintiffs did\nnot discuss any sexually-related activities with anyone prior to arriving at Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence. This reinforces our contention that no telephonic or Internet persuasion, inducement,\nenticement or coercion of a minor, or of any other individual, occurred. In addition, Mr. Jeffrey\nHerman, the former law partner of one of the federal prosecutors involved in this matter and the\nattorney for most of the civil complainants (as described in detail below), was quoted in the Palm\nBeach Post as saying that “it doesn’t matter” that his clients lied about their ages and told Mr.\nEpstein that they were 18 or 19.\n\nNot only is a federal prosecution of this matter unwarranted, but the irregularity of\nconduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the deferred prosecution agreement are\nbeyond any reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.
