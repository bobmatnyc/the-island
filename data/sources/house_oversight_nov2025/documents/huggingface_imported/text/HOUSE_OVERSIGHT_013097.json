  "text": "10.5 How Might the Mind-World Correspondence Principle Be Useful? 181\n\nThat is, a little more loosely: the hypothesis is that, for intelligence to occur, there has to be a\nnatural correspondence between the transition-sequences of world-states and the corresponding\ntransition-sequences of mind-states, at least in the cases of transition-sequences leading to\nrelevant goals.\n\nWe suspect that a variant of the above proposition can be formally proved, using the definition\nof general intelligence presented in Chapter 7. The proof of a theorem corresponding to the\nabove would certainly constitute an interesting start toward a general formal theory of general\nintelligence. Note that proving anything of this nature would require some attention to the\ntime-scale-dependence of the link weights in the transition graphs involved.\n\nA formally proved variant of the above proposition would be in short, a \"MIND-WORLD\nCORRESPONDENCE THEOREM.\"\n\nRecall that at the start of the chapter, we expressed the same idea as:\n\nMIND-WORLD CORRESPONDENCE-PRINCIPLE\n\nFor a mind to work intelligently toward certain goals in a certain world, there should be a\nnice mapping from goal-directed sequences of world-states into sequences of mind-states, where\n\"nice\" means that a world-state-sequence W composed of two parts W, and Ws, gets mapped\ninto a mind-state-sequence M composed of two corresponding parts MM, and Mg.\n\nThat is a reasonable gloss of the principle, but it’s clunkier and less accurate, than the\nstatement in terms of functors and path transfer functions, because it tries to use only common-\nlanguage vocabulary, which doesn’t really contain all the needed concepts.\n\n10.5 How Might the Mind-World Correspondence Principle Be\nUseful?\n\nSuppose one believes the Mind-World Correspondence Principle as laid out above so what?\n\nOur hope, obviously, is that the principle could be useful in actually figuring out how to\narchitect intelligent systems biased toward particular sorts of environment. And of course, this\nis said with the understanding that any finite intelligence must be biased toward some sorts of\nenvironment.\n\nRelatedly, given a specific AGI design (such as CogPrime), one could use the principle to\nfigure out which environments it would be best suited for. Or one could figure out how to\nadjust the particulars of the design, to maximize the system’s intelligence in the environments\nof interest.\n\nOne next step in developing this network of ideas, aside from (and potentially building on)\nfull formalization of the principle, would be an exploration of real-world environments in terms\nof transition graphs. What properties do the transition graphs induced from the real world\nhave?\n\nOne such property, we suggest, is successive refinement. Often the path toward a goal in-\nvolves first gaining an approximate understanding of a situation, then a slightly more accurate\nunderstanding, and so forth — until finally one has achieved a detailed enough understanding to\nactually achieve the goal. This would be represented by a world-path whose nodes are state-sets\ninvolving the gathering of progressively more detailed information.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013097",
