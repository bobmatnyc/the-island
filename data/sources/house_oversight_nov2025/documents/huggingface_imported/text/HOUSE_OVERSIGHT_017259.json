  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nfamiliar with, since it is the weapon of choice for law professors, of which Scalia had been one\nbefore ascending the bench.\n\nScalia asked me what my position would be if one bank robber had a gun and the other one\ndoesn’t and the one with the gun “throw[s] the gun to the trigger man, as the policeman’s\napproaching him, he says, ‘I need a gun,’ and I throw the gun to him...I don’t care whether he\nkills the policeman or not.”\nI had prepared for every likely question I might be asked by the justices, but the idea of a gun\nbeing throw by one robber to another had never occurred to me. I had to think quickly. In the\nclassroom, a poor answer to a professor’s bizarre “hypo” might reduce a grade, but in the\ncourtroom it could be a matter of life or death. I quickly recalled the facts of the Enmund case\nand reminded the justices that Enmund too had provided a gun to his co-conspirators who then\nkilled the couple, and that there was no difference between “throwing” a gun, as in Scalia’s\nhypothetical, and “providing” the gun, as in the real facts of Enmund: “There is no difference\nbetween this case and Enmund, except that this case is far more compelling.”\nScalia repeated his hypothetical:\n\n“Please, please.\n\nI don't understand your response to the second hypothetical I put to you.\n\nNever mind the trigger man.\n\nThe person who tosses the gun to the trigger man.\n\nThere is no way in which he has an intent to kill within the Constitutional rule; is that\nright?...he doesn’t care whether the policeman lives or dies.\n\nScalia persisted:\nBut the triggerman asks for a gun.\n“Toss me a gun.”\nHe tosses him the gun.\n\nHe says:\n“There is a policeman coming.”\n“Throw me a gun quick.”\n\nThat wouldn’t be enough?\n\n172\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017259",
