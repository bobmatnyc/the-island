That your community was induced to walk it's own\nchildren down the plank as compensation for what Loudoun had done to the young Dima Yakovlev?\nBecause now child exploitation is deeply embedded within your community with your own people\n(your own police, your own prosecutors, your own public defenders and private attorneys) protecting\nthis very system that will be used to take the futures of your Loudoun children (see more of the\ndetails below).
