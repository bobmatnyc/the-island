  "text": "When this happens, our promiscuous brain has worked its combinatorial magic, causing us to feel good\nwhen we witness someone else’s misfortune.\n\nSchadenfreude, like envy, causes us to self-evaluate, looking inside of ourselves to assess our net\nworth relative to others. We know from a large body of studies, several carried out by the American\nsocial psychologist Roy Baumeister, that when an individual’s sense of self-worth is threatened,\nespecially those individuals with more narcissistic and overly confident personalities, aggression often\nfollows. The more personally threatened we feel, the more pleasure we should feel when someone else\nsuffers. The Dutch psychologist Wilco van Dijk tested this idea with two simple experiments. In both\nexperiments, subjects filled out a questionnaire that they believed evaluated their intellectual strengths.\nUpon completion and scoring of the questionnaire, some were told that they had utterly flopped, scoring\nin the lowest 10% of all subjects, while others were told that they performed brilliantly, scoring in the\nupper 10%. Next, all subjects read a scenario in which someone suffers a misfortune. For example, in one\nscenario, a student rents an expensive car to show off at a party, but then drives the car into a river, not\nonly damaging the car but requiring the fire department to tow it out. Those whose sense of self-worth\nwas threatened by the abominable test score were more likely to say that they felt good about the\nmisfortune, including smirks and laughter in response to the show off who submerged his rented car.\nThese results powerfully show that schadenfreude serves the beneficial function of hoisting our own self-\nworth. When our self-worth has been challenged, for whatever reason, we feel better knowing that\nsomeone else is worse off, regardless of context or direct relevance.\n\nOur desire to see others suffer so that we may feel better can escalate to absurd levels, especially\nwhen it is fueled by ideology. Beliefs can blind us to the cost-benefit analysis, motivating us to see harm\ndone to those outside of our inner sanctum even if it hurts us as well. Religious and political ideologies\nare two of the hotspots that can drive entirely irrational desires and absurd attributions.\n\nThe American psychologist Richard Smith explored whether an individual’s political convictions\ninfluenced the intensity of schadenfreude when witnessing a member of another party suffer, including\ncases where society at large also suffers. Smith initiated the study prior to the US Presidential elections in\n2004 involving Republican George W. Bush and Democrat John Kerry; during this period, the\nRepublicans controlled both executive branches of the government. Each subject — all college\nundergraduates — provided information about party affiliation and strength of support for the policies\nand beliefs of their party. Next, every subject read and provided reactions to short newspaper articles\ndescribing tragicomic moments for the two candidates, one in which Bush fell off his bicycle while\nriding, and the other involving Kerry wearing a bizarre space outfit during a visit to NASA. Last,\nsubjects read and reacted to an article describing job losses and the economic downturn facing the nation\n\n— an article meant to capture an objective cost to all members of society, irrespective of party affiliation.\n\nHauser Chapter 2.
