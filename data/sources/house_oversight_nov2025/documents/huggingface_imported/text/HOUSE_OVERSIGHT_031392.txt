Just days before a Friday deadline, the Justice Department has reassigned the Jeffrey Epstein victims’ rights
case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Atlanta, the attorneys representing Epstein’s victims’ attorneys said

Tuesday.

Miami federal prosecutors, in letter to attorneys for the victims’s lawyers on Monday, said they had recused

themselves from the case, according to Brad Edwards and Jack Scarola, representing Epstein’s victims.

The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. “BJay” Pak, will
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta’s chief federal

prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017.
