  "text": "introduces a range of new incentives/ penalties that force market participants to address major\ncost, efficiency, and quality issues within the healthcare system.\n\nThe ACA and other healthcare reform initiatives are challenged by dual and somewhat\nconflicting objectives. They are focused on reducing costs and slowing growth rates in\nspending, but at the same time expand the size of the population that has access to healthcare\ncovered by third party payment mechanisms. In order to cover the increased costs of the\nexpanded coverage, reform initiatives attempt to radically improve the efficiency of healthcare\ndelivery as a way of freeing up resources that can be redirected to providing care to populations\nthat had previously not been covered. Some of the lowest hanging fruit that is being targeted in\nearly reform initiatives is eliminating waste from the healthcare system. There are enormous\nresources that can be freed up by eliminating expenditures that are unnecessary or duplicative.\nIn the U.S. healthcare system alone, there is an estimated $765 billion that is wasted annually.\nMore than half of that total ($415 billion) is the result of fraud, unnecessary services, and\ninefficiently or mistakenly delivered care. Another 25%+ of the total ($190 billion) is the result\nof excess administrative costs (eg., inefficiencies associated with paperwork and\ndocumentation)?”. Finding ways to reduce waste in the system offers the opportunity to create\nsignificant value, but requires the adoption of entirely new tools and technologies by payers,\nproviders, and patients. Developing these tools, applications, and systems is an area of\nsignificant opportunity for innovative technology focused companies.\n\nA major part of eliminating waste in healthcare will be accomplished by driving efficiency and\nderiving maximum benefit from the enormous levels of current expenditures. Achieving this\ngoal will have to include a fundamental change in focus to the principles of value-based\nmedicine across all levels of the healthcare system. This is a radical change in objectives that is\nalready happening, and it is leading to entirely new reimbursement models built around paying\nfor technologies and treatments that provide care efficiently and at a cost proportional to the\nhealth benefit they deliver. Value-based medicine focuses on outcomes from healthcare\nservices, which more closely aligns the interests of the payers with the healthcare providers and\nproduct companies whose services and products are the major cost elements in the delivery of\nhealthcare. Although simple conceptually, this is a fundamental change in how healthcare is\npaid for from the historical reimbursement models that have focused on fixed payments for\ndelivery of discrete procedures, with no corresponding emphasis on quality of the care\ndelivered or on the resulting patient outcomes.\n\nRefocusing treatment objectives within the healthcare system towards high quality outcomes\nover numbers of procedures will require many healthcare companies to reengineer aspects of\ntheir business models, but it will also provide them with new opportunity. In a system that\nrewards outcomes, companies and organizations that run with the highest quality and most\nefficiently will have significant opportunity to expand their own returns by taking on risk in the\ntreatment of patients. Opening the market to this dynamic, where there is opportunity to earna\nreturn on cost-effective, high quality patient management and outcomes, will stimulate the\ndevelopment and adoption of an entirely new set of enabling technologies and business models,\nwhich represent opportunity for innovative, technology-based, development and growth stage\ncompanies.\n\n27 National Academy of Sciences, “Best Care at Lower Cost: The Path to Continuously Learning Health Care in America”\n\n26 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024037",
