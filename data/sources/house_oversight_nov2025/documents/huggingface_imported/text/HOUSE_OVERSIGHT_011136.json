This fact\n\nwill prove helpful in adjusting the Ben-Porath model and in next generation theory.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that transfer out and transfer in are both implicitly\ndefined as net of plowback in the first place. Thus it would be wrong to suppose that\nnegative cash flow is transfer in less plowback from revenue. That mistake would\n\ndeduct plowback twice.\n\nThe Growth Truism\n\nGrowth of any asset of either factor is capitalization from outside plus capitalization\n\nfrom inside less decapitalization. This difference can also be called net capitalization.\n\nCapitalization from outside is simply transfer in t_ . What are the other two?\n\nOur first intuition would be that capitalization from inside is identical to unrealized\noutput. Here we must be careful. Output is negative wherever the sum of growth\n(net capitalization) and cash flow falls below zero. This “deadweight loss” is\nimplicitly uncovered decapitalization, meaning not recovered in cash flow. To\nsubtract all including unrecovered decapitalization from the sum of transfer in and\n\nunrealized output would therefore subtract the unrecovered part twice.\n\nTo make this clear, define positive and negative output by\nY(>0)=max(Y,0) and Y(<0)=max(-Y,0)=2,\n\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011136",
