  "text": "next century. How might Huang Hua, with his nature-of-the-age consideration of\nstrategy have regarded the matter? What does gatekeeping tell us?\n\nThe dominant view of future relations between Americans and Chinese generally\nruns along a nervously familiar historical track: An established power (the US) anda\nrising one (China) consider each other. Do they cooperate? Scratch at each other in\nconstant annoyance? Each nation possesses a different image the world. Each holds,\nas well, distinct pictures of their role. One power has enjoyed a long period of\nprosperity, has built and defended a global structure; the other, trod mercilessly\nunderfoot by history, feels the unbearable flow of power’s rising sap, a hunger for\nrecognition and release and for some, revenge; her economy craves resources, trade\nroutes, and markets. So Germany encountered and then attacked Great Britain at the\nturn of the 20 Century. Japan collided, similarly, with Russia in 1904. France taking\non Austria, Russia and Great Britain in the Napoleonic age.\n\nEven if the leaders of the United States and China intend to avoid conflict, they face\none of the most sobering, if not depressing, problems of international politics: The\n“security dilemma”. The world is a dangerous place. So countries do things to feel\nsafer. Their populations demand it. Germany looks at Britain’s imperial navy in the\n1890s: London could snap Berlin’s trade arteries. So the Kaiser orders two\nbattleships. Britain builds three in response. Germany turns to submarines. And so\non. Each country, chasing her own security, ends up /ess secure. This is the\n“dilemma”. The puzzle is like one of those woven wicker finger traps: The harder\neach side pulls to get out, the more stuck they become. America in 2012 pivots her\nmilitary gaze to Asia. China feels encircled. She orders a couple of aircraft carriers,\npaves remote islands into military bases. America flies aircraft closer to Chinese\nwaters. Are the two sides more secure? Collisions, arms racing, accelerating distrust\nbecome the threnody of contacts. Each side seeks something impossible: Perfect\nsecurity. Move first, certain forces begin to whisper in each capital.\n\nThe essence of this problem today, as the United States and China consider their\nfuture, is not merely or even mainly in the details of trade, territory, or cyber\ndisputes we read about. These hot points are important, of course, but they are\nsymptoms of differing judgments of the world, of a fracture at that first step of\nasking, “What is the nature of the age?” Americans generally believe the existing\nglobal power map is just, sustainable, in need — perhaps - of minor adjustments.\nAmerica engineered this system; benefits tremendously from it’s fictionless\noperation. China regards that same layout differently. As broken, unbalanced,\nrocking towards a seizure — and, anyhow, built, lubricated and run without her\nparticipation. This view is sharpened by ideology, national psychology and the bald\nfact that no global mechanism ever functions perfectly. The larger nature of the age\nis, many in Beijing feel, Da po, Da li. Great destruction. Great construction. Certainly\nthis is true inside China; it must be true outside. The nation has it’s hammers out.\nThey see the paradoxes of power we read about earlier, the inability to act and the\ncollapse of American credibility, as clearly as people in Washington or Damascus or\nMoscow. Surely the global system should be adjusted, they think. Tap. Tap.\n\n178\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018410",
