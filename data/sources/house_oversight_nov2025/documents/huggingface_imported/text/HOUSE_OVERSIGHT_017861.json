  "text": "796\n\nargue the Court’s adjudication of Plaintiffs’\nclaims would interfere with the executive\nbranch’s discretion to designate state\nsponsors of terror. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(7)(A) (isting statutes that give\nSecretary of State authority to designate\ncountries as sponsors of terrorism). Fi-\nnally, Defendants submit the purpose\nof(a)(5) was “to eliminate a foreign state’s\nimmunity for traffic accidents and other\ntorts committed in the United States, for\nwhich liability is imposed under domestic\ntort law.” Amerada Hess, 488 U.S. at\n439-40, 109 S.Ct. 6838; Burnett IT, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 19 (stating “the legislative\nhistory [of the FSIA] counsels that the\nexception should be narrowly construed so\nas not to encompass the farthest reaches\nof common law’).\n\nPlaintiffs respond that if Congress in-\ntended (a)(5) and (a)(7) to be mutually\nexclusive or intended that (a)(5) never ap-\nply in the terrorism context, Congress\nwould have said so. Indeed, Congress did\nso very explicitly with respect to (a)(5) and\n(a)(2) and between (a)(7) and (a)(2). See\n§ 1605(a)(5) (explaining exception can only\nbe used in situations “not otherwise en-\ncompassed in paragraph (2)”);\n§ 1605(a)@) Game). To further buttress\ntheir argument, Plaintiffs note the two ex-\nceptions have been interpreted to encom-\npass different situations. Subsection (a)(7)\ncovers acts of terrorism committed abroad\nby a state sponsor of terrorism, while sub-\nsection (a)(5) governs tortious acts, includ-\ning terrorism, performed in the United\nStates. See Flatow v. Islamic Republic of\nTran, 999 F.Supp. 1, 15 (D.D.C.1998) (find-\ning (a)(7) applied to conduct outside the\nUnited States and stating “28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(5) already provides jurisdiction\nover state-sponsored terrorist acts in the\nUnited States, ... the state sponsored ter-\nrorism exception would be redundant if it\nwere held to apply only within the United\nStates”). Again, Plaintiffs argue that De-\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nfendants’ argument of exclusivity would\nlead to absurd results, such that if a for-\neign sovereign not designated a state spon-\nsor of terror was involved in a car accident\nstemming from negligence it would not be\nimmune; but if it undertook a deliberate\nact of violence it would enjoy immunity\nfrom suit.\n\nThe Court understands Plaintiffs’ desire\nto find a legal remedy for the horrible\nwrongs committed on September 11, 2001.\nIf appropriate, however, these Defendants\nare entitled to immunity from litigating\nthese gravely serious claims in this forum.\nCongress made a policy decision that the\nExecutive branch, and not the courts, have\nthe authority to label a foreign nation a\nterrorist. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(7)(A).\nBut when it drafted the state sponsor of\nterror exception it did not include mutually\nexclusive language that would preclude the\napplication of the torts exception here. It\ndid include such language with respect to\nthe commercial activities exception. See\n28 USC. § 1605(a)(7) “A foreign state\nshall not be immune from jurisdiction of\ncourts of the United States or of the States\nin any case—not otherwise covered by\nparagraph (2) above.”); see also 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(5) “A foreign state shall not be\nimmune from jurisdiction of courts of the\nUnited States or of the States in any\ncase—not otherwise encompassed in para-\ngraph (2) above.”). Particularly in a case\nsuch as this where interests of sovereignty,\ncomity, international relations, and separa-\ntion of powers are implicated, the Court\nmust be vigilant to exercise discipline to\napply the law only as it is written. While\nthere are certainly obstacles to (a)(5)’s ap-\nplication—and the Court is not convinced\nthe Plaintiffs have or can overcome\nthem—the Court will not rule as a matter\nof law that subsections (a)(7) and (a)(5) are\nmutually exclusive. Accordingly, the\nCourt will consider Plaintiffs’ evidence\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017861",
