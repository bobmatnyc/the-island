  "text": "ACKRELL\nCAPITAL CHAPTER VI|_ Capital Markets for Cannabis Companies\nIn addition, an increasing number of direct lenders are participating in the private debt markets\nfor cannabis-related companies. These lenders represent an important capital source for the industry,\nas typical forms of debt capital, such as bank financing, remain unavailable to most companies. As in\nother industries, debt financing is typically available only to those companies having meaningful cash\nflow or tangible assets to secure the debt. While the number of lenders is increasing, there is still a\nrelative scarcity of debt capital available to the cannabis industry, which can lead to a higher debt cost\nof capital of 200-500 basis points or more for cannabis-related companies, as compared to companies\n\nin other industries.\n\nThe following chart illustrates the type of debt that may be available to cannabis-related companies,\nrepresentative terms of such debt, and the types of companies that may be able to access debt in the\nprivate markets.\n\nDebt Financing Alternatives for Cannabis-Related Companies\n\nCost of Capital\n\nSenior Low Double Digits Type of : Type of\n\nSecuritization Borrowers:\n\n(if secured): \\ Cultivators\n\nLease Land ( Extractors\nFinancing Buildings Dispensaries\n\nMid-teens Equipment j Product Manufacturers\nAIR\nInventory\n\nConvertible\nDebt\n\nLess Restrictive\n\n= Final Thoughts\n\nAs stated previously, valuations and stock price fluctuations in the cannabis industry continue to be\ndriven more by expectations for the cannabis industry in general than by individual company funda-\nmentals. Today, in the public markets, trading volumes are too low, trading prices are too volatile and\noperating histories are too limited to place any reliance on current valuation levels in the cannabis\nindustry. We believe that this dynamic will continue until cannabis-related companies have matured\nand start to realize meaningful revenue, profitability and other financial metrics that will allow inves-\ntors to evaluate companies within the industry by more traditional methodology.\n\nIt is still too early to know how the cannabis industry or its sectors will be valued in the future. It\nmay come to pass that companies in the cannabis industry are valued comparably to public companies\nin industries with similar characteristics, such as the alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical and consumer\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 135\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024771",
