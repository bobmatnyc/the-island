From Yellen going back\nto Alan Greenspan, who started as chair in 1987, all Fed chairs have held a Ph.D. in economics. Alan Blinder,\nan economist at Princeton, has said that a doctorate has become more or less a prerequisite of the job—without\none, he told Harvard Business Review, “the Fed’s staff will run technical rings around you.” While that remains\nto be seen, it is true that there are over 300 Ph.D. economists on the Fed’s staff, and Powell could end up\nneeding to lean on their expertise more than a Fed chair with a doctorate in economics might.\n\nOn Sat, Dec 22, 2018 at 10:40 AM Steve Bannon <q wrote:\nCan u get rid of Powell or really get rid of mnuchin\n\nOn Dec 22, 2018, at 10:35 AM, J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\ngetting rid of powell much more important than syria /mattis. .
