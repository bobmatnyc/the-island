A combination of weak oil prices and their inevitable impact on the Saudi\neconomy including slowing economic growth, rising operational risks and fiscal\nconsolidation (including subsidy removals) have been the key drivers. The\nunderperformance has left the market trading on a 12mth P/E of c.13x, an 11% discount\nto its long term average and its lowest premium to GEMs since 2010 (Saudi trades on a\n7% percent premium vs long run average of c. 30%). Furthermore, Saudi trades on\n12mth FWD P/B ratio of 1.5x, a 20% discount to long run averages, but a 15% premium\nto GEMs on 1.3x, justified by the market’s higher ROE’s (Saudi’s long term P/B premium\nhas been c.25%). Finally, Saudi trades on 12mth FWD EV/EBITDA multiples of 9x, a\nc.11% discount to long run averages.\n\n42 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016152",
