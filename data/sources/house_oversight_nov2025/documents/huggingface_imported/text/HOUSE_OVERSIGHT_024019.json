  "text": "play a critical role in enabling the necessary structural changes to the healthcare system. The\nHITECH Act created a $25.9 billion!? Federal Government funded catalyst for the adoption of\ninformation technology in healthcare in the U.S., and this is stimulating significant investment\nin upgrading the information infrastructure at the provider level. This industry-wide\ntechnology upgrade moves the vast majority of providers onto electronic systems, which offers\nimmediate efficiencies to their businesses and lays the foundation for the adoption of new\ntargeted information based applications in the future. These investments and legislative actions\nby the U.S. government, and the subsequent response by insurers, providers and patients, are\ndriving a dramatic increase in spending on healthcare information technology (HIT), benefitting\nthe companies providing technology solutions that reduce cost and waste, drive efficiency, and\nimprove the quality of patient care.\n\nThe opportunity in information convergence also benefits significantly from the technologies\nand infrastructure that have been developed and implemented outside of healthcare, such as\ncloud computing, wireless communications, web-delivered software-as-a-service, and sensor\ntechnology. Small companies drawing heavily off these existing technologies are able to\noptimize their product through rapid iterations driven by user feedback, thereby reducing risk\nand capital requirements, and leading to more predictable timelines, similar to what has been\nseen in the broader information technology arena. The Fund Managers believe that smaller,\nfocused companies will play a key role in developing and deploying information based\nproducts that address discrete problems within the U.S. healthcare market, and that a large\nnumber of these will be compelling investment opportunities for NLV-IIL.\n\nMedical Devices: Given the Fund Managers’ view that the operating and exit environment for\ncompanies in this sector will be more challenging due to increased regulatory and\nreimbursement uncertainty, NLV-III will have somewhat less exposure to this sector than\nprevious funds. The Fund will focus on investments in companies that are developing\ninnovative and differentiated medical devices, targeting large market opportunities that offer\nthe potential to meaningfully reduce overall patient treatment costs in high morbidity disease\nsettings through substantial efficacy and safety benefits versus existing standards of care.\nImportantly, the focus will be on opportunities that have established regulatory approval\npathways and clear regulatory precedents, or are already at the commercial stage at the time of\ninitial investment. The objective will be to identify investment opportunities with later stage\nrisk profiles that can be expected to thrive in the current environment. Although the number of\ndeals in this sector is likely to be somewhat lower than in previous funds, with the later stage\nfocus, it is likely that the size of investments in this sector will be larger.\n\nBiological Research Tools & Infrastructure: The rapid growth of this sector is being fuelled by\nmany of the same biomedical advances that are impacting health care more broadly, such as\npersonalized medicine and DNA sequencing. Smaller companies have always been a prolific\nsource of innovative new research tools, leading to high M&A interest among the large\ncommercial players in this sector. Moreover, because new reagents and research tools are not\nsubject to the risks of clinical trials, regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement it is possible\nto build high-gross margins businesses that reach break-even on manageable timelines and\nbudgets. The Fund will approach this sector opportunistically and will seek to invest in a small\n\nBus. Department of Health and Human Services.
