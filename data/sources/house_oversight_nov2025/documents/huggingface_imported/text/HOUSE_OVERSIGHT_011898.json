Operationally, everything was ready. Politically, those ministers who\nwere against military action had not changed their minds. If anything, they seemed\nmore strongly opposed. Ironically, they now argued that because we’d waited so\nlong, the Iranians were too close to their “window of immunity.” Even some senior\nmembers of the military and security establishment, though in agreement over the\ntechnical aspects of the attack plan, retained political reservations. But as I'd told\nPresident Obama, now that we had the operational support of the military and\nintelligence professionals, the decision in effect rested with Bibi and me. The fact\nwe were ready to go ahead in those circumstances was not unprecedented. When\nMenachem Begin ordered the bombing of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor in\n1981, he had acted against the advice of the then-heads of both the Mossad and\nmilitary intelligence, the chairman of our nuclear energy commission, and of\nShimon Peres, who was head of the Labor opposition.\n\nBut as we neared our final, formal decision, we were forced into another delay.\nIn the summer of 2012, an unrelated flare-up of tensions in the Gulf caused Iran\nand several of its neighbors to place their forces on heightened alert. Though the\npeak-alert phase passed quickly, Iran’s military was still not back on a fully normal\nfooting by the start of September, and when small American advance teams began\narriving for the joint exercises, Iran’s alert level went up again. Technically, we\ncould still have gone ahead with the attack. In all probability, it would still have\nsucceeded, setting back the Iranians’ program by at least a year and, depending on\nhow quickly they could rebuild and resupply clandestinely abroad, perhaps for\nsignificantly longer.\n\nBut as more and more American soldiers and sailors arrived, I finally decided\nagainst an Israeli strike — not because I doubted the damage it would do to Iran’s\nnuclear efforts, but because of the damage it would surely do to our ties with the\n\n427\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011898",
