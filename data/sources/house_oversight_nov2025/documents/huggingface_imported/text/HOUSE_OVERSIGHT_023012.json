  "text": "January: Virginia Roberts files court papers in Florida claiming that she was\nforced by Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew and lawyer Alan Dershowitz when\nshe was underage. In a sworn affidavit, she provides photographs of her with the\nprince and with Epstein’s close associate, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. She\nclaims Maxwell worked as Epstein’s madam, which she denies. Dershowitz and the\nprince deny her claims as well, setting off a series of legal actions between\nDershowitz and Roberts’ attorneys that are later resolved in an out-of-court\nsettlement.\n\nApril: A federal judge rules that Roberts cannot join the federal Crime Victims’\nRights Act lawsuit and that her affidavit — accusing Prince Andrew and Dershowitz\nof having sex with her when she was underage — be stricken from the case.\nDershowitz said the ruling meant he was vindicated. However, the judge does not\naddress the veracity of Roberts’ claims, writing: “The factual details regarding with\nwhom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and\nimpertinent to this central claim.”\n\nSeptember: Roberts sues Maxwell in federal court in New York, claiming that\nEpstein’s alleged madam defamed her in public statements in the media. The\nlawsuit is widely viewed as a vessel for Epstein’s victims to expose the scope of\nEpstein’s crimes. Several civil lawsuits filed the same year allege that Epstein and\nMaxwell operated an international sex trafficking operation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023012",
