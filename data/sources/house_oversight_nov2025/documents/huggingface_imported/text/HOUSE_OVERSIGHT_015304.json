It did.\n\nAfter Leary got arrested in Texas for possession of pot, the notoriety\nof his research in Millbrook spread. Law enforcement in nearby\nPoughkeepsie, led by Assistant District Attorney G. Gordon Liddy, raided\nthe estate. In the summer of 1966, Leary and his associates ran a two-week\nseminar on consciousness expansion, culminating in a_ theatrical\nproduction of Hesse's Steppenwo/flegend that weaved its way around the\nMillbrook grounds and buildings. Leary invited Liddy and members of the\ngrand jury that indicted him, but none showed up.\n\nLeary told me about prominent people whose lives had been\nchanged by taking LSD: actor Cary Grant, director Otto Preminger, think-\ntanker Herman Kahn, Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill Wilson, 7/ME\nmagazine publishers Henry and Clare Boothe Luce. Of course, it wasn't so\ndifficult to drop out when you had such a stimulating scene to drop into.\nOn the day that he announced the formation of a new religion, the League\n\nfor Spiritual Discovery (LSD), | signed up as their first heretic.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015304",
