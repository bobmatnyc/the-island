For context, $6,872 in healthcare\nbenefits is 13% of average annual per-capita income for Americans.\n\ne When Medicaid was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to low-\nincome Americans, 1 in 50 Americans received Medicaid, now 1 in 6\nAmericans receives Medicaid.\n\ne That said, Medicaid is an important benefit for recipients as it provides\naccess to healthcare for low-income adults and their children. In recent\nyears, Medicaid beneficiaries and benefit payments have risen faster than\npopulation and per-capita income growth owing to expanded coverage,\neconomic difficulties and associated sluggish wage growth for low- and\nlower-middle-income families, and continued healthcare cost inflation.\n\nKP Note: Data are inflation adjusted.
