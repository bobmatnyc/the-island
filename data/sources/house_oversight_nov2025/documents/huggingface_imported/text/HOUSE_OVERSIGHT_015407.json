We really do. Needless to say, rape,\nthe most heinous crime imaginable, seems it’ sacomic’ s dream, though.\nIt' s because it seems when you do rape jokes, that the material is so\ndangerous and edgy, and the truth is, it’ s like the safest area to talk\nabout in comedy‘ cause who’ s gonna complain about a rape joke? Rape\nvictims? They don’ t even report rape. They’ re just traditionally not\n\ncomplainers.”\n\nIronically, in 7he Aristocrats, a documentary entirely about a classic\njoke of the same name, Silverman complained (facetiously) that she was\nonce raped by show-biz legend Joe Franklin. Also, her rape tips for men\ninclude, \"Carry a rape whistle. If you find that you are about to rape\nsomeone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you.\" However,\nanother joke of hers goes like this: “Il was raped by a doctor—which is so\n\nbittersweet for a Jewish girl.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015407",
