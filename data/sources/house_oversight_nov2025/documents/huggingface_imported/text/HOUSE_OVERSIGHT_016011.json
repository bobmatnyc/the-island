It must somehow split up and consider both the available paths\nreflecting off the glass surfaces.\n\nNow that we have these two concepts in our head, that a photon\nsometimes reflects and sometimes does not, and a single photon must\nconsider both paths, we can ask: what tells the photon what to do?\n\nThere are only three possible answers: the light source that emitted\nthe photon, the pane of glass that reflected the photon or the observer\nthat saw the photon — me.\n\nThe first obvious place that might control the photon is the original\nsource of the photon; the light bulb. The photon might leave the bulb\nalready knowing what path to follow, whether it will be reflected and\nwhether that reflection will be affected by the gap between the two\nsurfaces in a positive or negative way. This is sometimes called a pilot\nwave theory. The problem with this theory is I could insert a piece of\nglass into the experiment after the photon has left the light source. This\nwill affect the photon but the light source could not have known my\nintention in advance and told the photon what to do. Therefore, the path\nof the photon is not pre-programmed by the light source.\n\nNow our photon has left the bulb and is traveling toward the glass.\nThe glass has two surfaces. The photon reaches the first surface and has\nto decide if it will reflect. But there is a problem. The second surface\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016011",
