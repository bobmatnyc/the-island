  "text": "You: Hi, Mr. Grisham. My name is Tim Ferriss. I know this might sound a bit odd, but I’m a first-time\nauthor and a longtime fan. I just read your interview in Time Out New York and finally built up the\ncourage to call. I have wanted to ask you for a specific piece of advice for a long time, and it shouldn’t\n\ntake more than two minutes of your time. May I?22\nJohn Grisham: Uh ... OK. Go ahead. I have to be on a call in a few minutes.\n\nYou (at the very end of the call): Thank you so much for being so generous with your time. If I have the\noccasional tough question—very occasional—is there any chance I could keep in touch via e-mail?28\n\n» LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\n\nOVER THE MOON\n\nMy 13-year-old daughter would like to be an astronaut when she grows up. Last year she had an\nextreme challenge to deal with. The phrase from Apollo 13 “Failure is not an option” sort of became our\nmotto. I got the idea of contacting the commander of Apollo 13, Jim Lovell. It didn’t take much to find\nhim and he sent her a wonderful letter about his ordeal just to get into the Apollo program, not to\nmention dealing with a crippled spacecraft. His letter made a big difference to my daughter. A couple\nmonths later, we were able to take things a little further by getting her VIP access to a shuttle launch.\n\n—ROB\n\n» TOOLS AND TRICKS\nConfirming Sufficient Market Size\n\n» Compete (www.compete.com) and\nQuantcast (www.quantcast.com)\n\nFind the number of monthly visitors for most websites, in addition to the search terms that generate the\nmost traffic for them.\n\n= Writer’s Market ( www.writersmarket.com )\n\nHere you'll find a listing of thousands of specialty and niche magazines, including circulation and\nsubscription numbers.
