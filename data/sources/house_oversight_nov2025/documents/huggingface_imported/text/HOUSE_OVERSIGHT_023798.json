When asked, they can tell you clear reasons (typically\npost hoc justifications) as to why they decided the way they did. The\nwine expert can say reasons as well, but the evidence for taste is not\nreally all that objective. (Of course, the evidence may be found after\nthe judgment is made. People are not always entirely rational.)\n\nTo learn to make objective judgments, one needs constant feed-\nback either from a teacher or from a colleague or from reality. One\nneeds to think about what was decided and why. People who are good\nat this are good at it because they have analyzed their successes and\nfailures and they can articulate their reasoning. Learning requires re-\npeated practice.\n\nSOCIAL PROCESSES\n\n1.

We\nregularly interact with family, friends, colleagues, bosses, romantic in-\nterests, professors, service personnel, and strangers. Communicating\neffectively is very important to any success we might want to have in\nany area of life. But, we do not know why we say what we say, nor do\nwe really understand how we are being perceived by others. We just\ntalk and listen and go on our way. Some people are loved by everyone\nand others are despised. It is wrong to assume that we know what\nimage we project or that we are easily capable of altering the way we\nbehave so that we will be perceived differently.\n\nHow do we learn to become conscious of inherently unconscious\nbehavior? One can learn to behave differently if one becomes con-\nsciously aware of the mistakes one is making. Watching others, watch-\ning oneself, thinking about how to improve—all this helps one make\nsubconscious behavior into conscious behavior.\n\nWe unintentionally return to standard ways of acting in various\nsituations. A wallflower at a party doesn’t decide to be a wallflower—it\nis simply behavior she is comfortable with. If no one is harmed by\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023798",
