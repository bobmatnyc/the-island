  "text": "laced reports hinting that the former president must have been in some way complicit when he voyaged with a billionaire known for\n\npreying on underage girls.\n\nIt’s a story with plenty to gape at, from horrific and excruciatingly detailed allegations against Epstein to the frequent presence of a\n\nformer president who was, after all, nearly chased from office for a (consensual) affair with an intern.\n\nBut sometimes stories that seem too good to be true — just might be. A detailed review by a team of BuzzFeed News reporters of\nmore than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and federal\ncourt found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are exaggerated at\nbest; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject — themselves never\nsuggest that Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that many of the most lurid\n\ninsinuations have been floated without any visible support from verifiable information.\n\nWhile it’s still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving Epstein,\nthe fact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should not be\n\nencouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst.\n\nOne sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been\n\nmarkedly vague on details.\n\nWhen asked to present actual proof, Jack Scarola, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing\ndocuments that have come to light in recent weeks, warned darkly in an email of “extortionate threats, power, wealth or political\n\npressure.”\n\n“The time will come when all your questions will be answered,” said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in\n\nPalm Beach County Court. “But that time is not now.”\n\nUnwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the Atlantic have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish\nbreathless descriptions of Epstein’s “black book,” which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every other\npowerful figure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier’s private 727 aircraft that frequently\ncapture Bubba at 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein’s sex slave as\na teenager and whose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on “Orgy Island” in 2002 to participate in a sexual romp,\n\npossibly with women who were not yet of age.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022686",
