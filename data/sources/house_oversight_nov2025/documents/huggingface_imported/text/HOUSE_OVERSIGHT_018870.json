People on both\nsides worked heroically, and, on\nTuesday, their candidates behaved well.\nThis should be a happy time.\n\nOh, my God! There’s a fiscal cliff\nWe're all going to fall over and go\nbankrupt!\n\nDid you just hear the cheerful rule?\nThe fiscal cliff doesn’t happen until the\nend of the year when the Bush tax cuts\nexpire and monster budget cuts auto-\nmatically kick in. Now that the elec-\ntion’s over, everybody will certainly be\nready to move forward and work some-\nthing out.\n\nExcept possibly Gov. Rick Perry,\nwho celebrated the president’s re-elec-\ntion by demanding the repeal of\nObamacare.\n\nAnd then there was Donald Trump,\nwho tweeted during the vote count:\n“Lets fight like hell and stop this great\nand disgusting injustice! The world is\ntaughing at us.”\n\nActually Trump has no conceivable\nimpact on anything. I just wanted to\ntake this opportumity to reminisce about\nthe time he sent me an irate, handwrit-\nten message in which he misspelled the\nword “too.”\n\nBut look atRep. John Boehner. On\nWednesday, the House speaker gave a\nspeech in which he vowed to be coop-\nerative.\n\n“Mister President, this is your\nmoment. We’re ready. to be led,” he\nsaid.\n\nxcept for a few no-go areas, such\nas any ta incteases on “small busi-\nness.” You may remember from previ-\nous crises that the House Republicans\noppose raising income ta es on the\nwealthy because it would impact strug-\ngling small businesses such as a hedge\n\nGail Collins\n\nfund manager with an eight-figure\nannual income.\n\nBoebner also raised a whole new\nspecter of political peril: “going over\npart of the fiscal cliff” That sounded\nless dire, as long as we all stay inside\nour dangling cars and refrain from\nmaking any moves until help arrives.\n\nBut, by the end, it sounded as if the\nonly cliff-avoidance Boehner was real-\nly interested in was one that caised new\nrevenue through “fewer loopholes, and\nlower rates for all.”\n\nWe have already seen that plan. It\nwas proposed by a man who, on\nTuesday, lost the state in which he was\nborn, the state in which he was gover-\nnor and the three states in which he\nowns houses. Thanks to a blog by Eric\nOstermeier in Smart Politics, I am able\nto point out that the only candidate for\npresident who lost his home state by a\nlarger margin than Mitt Romney was\nJohn Fremont in 1856. And Fremont\nwas coming out of a campaign in\nwhich the opposition accused him of\nbeing a cannibal\n\nWhile Boehner was explaining the\nimportance of not going halfway over\na cliff, or raising income taxes on the\nrich he looked somber and somewhat\nunhappy. This may have been because\nhis Republican colleagues just lost the\nWhite House and the Senate. Or per-\nhaps, it was simply because he’s an\nolder white guy, and, therefore, part of\nthe biggest loser demographic of the\nelection, the flip-side of the insurgent\nLatmo vote.\n\nOn election night, people were talk-\ning about the not-young male popula-\ntion as if they were a dwinding tribe of\ngraybeards sitting around a sputtermg\nstove in Oklahoma. Republican strate-\n\ngist John Weaver worried about\nbecoming “a shnoking regional party\nof middle-aged and older white men.”\nOn Fox News, Bill O’Reilly moaned\nthat “the white establishment is now\nthe minority.”\n\nO’Reilly, 63, added that the new\nmajority was composed of people\nwho “want stuff.” As opposed to\nolder white men, all of whom have\nsigned a pledge never to accept vet-\neran benefits, Social Security or\nMedicare.\n\n“Tt’s not a traditional America any-\nmore,” O’Reilly sadly concluded.\n\nAlmost everybody thinks of the\nworld of their youth as the traditional\nworld. In the future, today’s teenagers\nwill be looking back and mournfully\ndeclaring that traditional America was\na place where folks really knew how to\nTwitter. Stull, it’s unseemly to identify\nthe tue America as the one where your\ngroup ran everything.\n\nCheer up, white men! You seem to\nbe doing OK. Next year women will\nhave 20 percent of the seats in the US.\nSenate, and we’re celebrating.\n\nAnd since it looks as if we’re not\ngetting any downtime, we’ll have to\nget cracking on this latest congressio-\nnal crisis. Root for a bipartisan solution\nthat does notinvolve the White House’s\nbeing hijacked by a guy who keeps\nbabbling about going halfway over a\ncliff.\n\nIn the past, when these things came\nup, the president’s big failing was his\ninability to hide his conternpt for many\nof the people who occupy Capitol Hill.\nNow it’s anew day, and he needs to be\nSO perpehially and visibly available that\nthe negotiators beg to be left alone.\n\nIf all else fails, strap John Boehner\nto the roof of a car.\n\n— Gail Collins is a New York\nTimes columnist. .\n\nAINER\n\n2atd\n\nCan Republicans ada\n\nThis was one that the Republicans\nreally should have won.\n\nGiven the weak economy, Amencan\nvoters were open to firing President\nBarack Obama. In Europe, in similar\ncircumstances, one government after\nanother lost re-election. And, at the\nbeginning of this year, it looked as if\nthe Republicans might win control of\nthe U.S. Senate as well.\n\nYet it wasn’t the Democrats who\nwon so much as the Republicans who\nlost — at a most basic level, because\nof demography. A coalition of aging\nwhite men is a recipe for failure in a\nnation that increasingly looks like a\nrainbow.\n\nSchadenfreude may excuse\nDemocrats’ smiles for a few days, but\nthese trends portend a potential disas-\nter not just for the Republican Party\nbut for the health of our political sys-\ntem. America needs a plausible cen-\nter-right opposition party to hold\nObama’s feet to the fire, not just a\ncollection of Tea Party cranks.\n\nSo liberals as well as conservatives\nshould be rooting for the Republican\nParty to feel sufficiently shaken that it\nshifts to the center. Ove hopeful sign is\nthat political parties usually care more\nabout winning than about purism.\nThus the Democratic Party embraced\nthe pragmatic center-left Bill Clinton\nin 1992 after three consecutive losses\nin presidential elections.\n\nThat was painful for many liberals,\nwho cringed when Clinton interrupt-\ned campaigning in the 1992 pnmary\nto burmish his law-and-order creden-\ntials by overseeing the execution of a\nmentally impaired murderer. But it\nwas, on balance, less painful than los-\ning again.\n\nYou would expect the Republican\nParty to make a similar lurch to the\ncenter. But many Republican leaders\nstill inhabit a bubble. It was stunning\nhow many, from Karl Rove to Newt\nGingrich, seemed to expect a Mitt\nRomney victory. And some of the\nright-wing postmortems are suggest-\ning that Romney lost because he was\ntoo liberal— which constitutes a def-\ninition of delusional.\n\nImagine what would have hap-\npened if the Republican nominee had\nbeen Gingrich or Rick Santorum. We\nsurely would have seen a Democratic\nlandslide.\n\nOn the other hand, if the\nRepublicans had nominated Jon\nHuntsman Jr., they might have been\nthe ones celebrating ight now. But he\nhad no chance in Republican prima-\nries because primary voters are their\nparty’s worst enemy.\n\nPart of the problem, I think, is the\nprofusion of right-wing radio and\ntelevision programs. Democrats com-\nplain furiously that Rush Limbaugh,\nGlenn Beck and Sean Hannity smear\nthe left, but | wonder if the bigger\nloser isn’t the Republican Party itself.\nThose shows whip up a frenzy in\ntheir audience, torpedoing Republican\nmoderates and instilling paranoia on\n\nThe Virgin Islands Daily Ne\n\nNicholas D. K\n\nthe Republican Party m an ideologi-\ncal cocoop-and impedes it from\nreaching out to swing-state cen trists,\nor even un ing them The vor-\ntex spins éver faster and rik? becom-\ning an ideological blackhole.\n\nIn 2002, a book was published\ncalled “The Emerging Democratic\nMajority.” It argued that Democrats _\nwould gain because of ther strength\nin expanding demographics such as° -\nHispanics, Asian-Americans and\nworking women. It seemed persua-\nsive until Republicans clobbered\nDemocrats in the next couple of\nelections. Hs\n\nBut perhaps that book was ahead\nof its time. This was the first election\nin which Hispani\n\nic voters made up a\ndouble-digit share of the electorate, ”\naccordin gto CNN exit polls — 10 —\npercent, doubled from 1996 — and\nore than 7 out of 10 Hispanic voters\n\nof the Hispanic vote. But Republicans\nbecame obstructionist on immigra-\ntion and ‘then veered into offensive\nopposing the nomina-\na Sotomayor to the\n\nthe Democrats” laps. « 3\n\nThen there'are women. The pater-\nnalistic comments about rape by a\nfew male Republican candidates res-\nonated so ‘broadly because they\nreflected the perception of the GOP\nas a conclave of out-of-tovch men. As\nRep. Todd Akin of Missouri might\nput it, when a candidate emerges with\noffensive: views about rape, “the\nfemale body has ways to try to shut\nthat whole thing down.” Namely,\nthey vote Democratic.\n\nAmerica is changing. After this\nelection, a record 20 senators will be\nwomen, almost all of them\nDemocrats. Opposition to same-sex\nmarriage used to be a way for\n\n‘Republicans to trumpet their morali-\n\nty; now it’s seen as highlighting their\nbigotry.\n\nAn astonishing 45 percent of\nObama voters were members of\nminority groups, according to The\nTimnes’ Nate Silver. Many others were\nwomen or young people. That’s the\nfuture of America, and if the\nRepublican Party remains a purist\ncohortbuiltaround grumpy old white\nmen, it is committing suicide. That’s\nbad not just for conservanves but for\nour entire country.\n\n— Nicholas D. Kristof is a New\nYork Times columnist.
