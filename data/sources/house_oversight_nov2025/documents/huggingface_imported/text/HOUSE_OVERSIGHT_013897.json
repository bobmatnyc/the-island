  "text": "profitable. It is the fastest to set up but the fastest to die off due to price competition with other resellers.\nThe profitable life span of each product is short unless an exclusivity agreement prevents others from\n\nselling it. Reselling is, however, an excellent option for secondary back-end2® products that can be sold\nto existing customers or cross-sold22 to new customers online or on the phone.\n\nTo purchase at wholesale, use these steps.\n\nContact the manufacturer and request a “wholesale pricelist” (generally 40% off retail) and terms.\n\n2. If a business tax ID number is needed, print out the proper forms from your state’s Secretary of\nState website and file for an LLC (which I prefer) or similar protective business structure for\n$100-200.\n\nDo NOT purchase product until you have completed Step 3 in the next chapter. It is enough at this\npoint to confirm the profit margin and have product photos and sales literature.\n\nThat’s reselling. Not much more to it.\n\nOption Two: License a Product\n\nI not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow.\n\n— WOODROW WILSON\n\nSome of the world’s best-known brands and products have been borrowed from someone or\nsomewhere else.\n\nThe basis for the energy drink Red Bull came from a tonic in Thailand, and the Smurfs were brought\nfrom Belgium. Pokémon came from the land of Honda. The band KISS made millions in record and\nconcert sales, but the real profit has been in licensing— granting others the right to produce hundreds of\nproducts with their name and image in exchange for a percentage of sales.\n\nThere are two parties involved in a licensing deal, and a member of the New Rich could be either.\n\nFirst, there is the inventor of the product 22 called the “licensor,” who can sell others the right to\nmanufacture, use, or sell his or her product, usually for 3-10% of the wholesale price (usually around\n40% off retail) for each unit sold. Invent, let someone else do the rest, and cash checks. Not a bad model.\n\nThe other side of the equation is the person interested in manufacturing and selling the inventor’s\nproduct for 90-97% of the profit: the licensee. This is, for me and most NR, more interesting.\n\nLicensing is, however, dealmaking-intensive on both sides and a science unto itself. Creative contract\nnegotiation is essential and most readers will run into problems if it’s their first product. For real-world\ncase studies on both sides, ranging from Teddy Ruxpin to Tae-Bo, and full agreements with actual dollar\namounts, visit www.fourhourblog.com. From how to sell inventions without prototypes or patents to how\nto secure rights to products as a no-name beginner, it’s all there. The economics are fascinating and the\nprofits can be astounding.\n\nIn the meantime, we will focus on the least complicated and most profitable option open to the most\npeople: product creation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013897",
