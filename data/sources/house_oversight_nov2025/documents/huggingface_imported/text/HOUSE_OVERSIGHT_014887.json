This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\n1Q Preview; Expectations building on a strong 2H\nOur early sector preview highlights our estimates vs. Street, early 1Q data points, and\nsome opportunities for 1Q results for 30 stocks in our coverage group (more detailed\ncompany previews to follow). For large-caps, Street 2017 EPS estimates are down 8%\nYTD while the average stock price is up 9% YTD; suggesting macro and 2H optimism is\ndriving stocks, which could continue throughout earnings season. 1Q was not without\npotential pressures, including ramping competition in several sectors and delayed tax\nrefunds. A key theme for the group, in our view, is advertising & listing ranking revenue\ninitiatives at eCommerce sites (AMZN, EBAY, EXPE), and we are constructive on all three\nstocks. Per our Internet sentiment ranking screen (page 7), FB, WIX, TREE have best\nsentiment while TWTR and TRIP have weakest.\nA few early checks positive, mixed eCommerce data\nOur early ad checks suggest robust overall demand, aided by somewhat easy comps vs\n1Q’16, with Instagram momentum a standout. eCommerce is more mixed, with some\nconcerns on consumer spending due to delayed tax refunds, but optimism that spending\nwill rebound in March/April. In travel, there are modest concerns on pressure on US\ninbound travel, a bigger negative for Expedia than Priceline. FX spot rates for both the\nEuro and the Pound have depreciated 1% vs. the US$ since end of Jan.\nMany key upcoming events for stocks in 2Q\nTop events in 2Q include Facebook’s F8 developer conference on April 18-19, Google’s\nMarketing Next keynote on 5/23, an AWS event in San Francisco on April 18-19,\nexpected closing Verizon’s acquisition of Yahoo, Netflix’s release of several key\nfranchise including House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Sense8, Glow, and\nUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, consumer wide release of Pandora Premium, Expedia’s\nnew HomeAway disclosures and, possibly, Amazon’s new revenue disclosures.\nWe expect meet/beat EPS for several companies\nWe are above the Street on 2017 EPS for 16 of the 25 stocks discussed within and, of those,\nwe are most confident in Facebook & Priceline for 1Q upside potential. We expect Facebook\nto benefit from robust traffic, Instagram momentum, and greater adoption of audience\ntargeting tools. We also think Priceline can beat 1Q given strong booking trends into the\nquarter and a modest recovery in European travel. We are below the Street on 2017 EPS for\nAMZN, TRIP, and YHOO. Expedia is a top eComm/travel idea for 2Q/3Q on potential for\naccelerating room nights, HomeAway optimism, and less uncertainty on near-term estimates.\nGOOG, AMZN & ZG interesting 1Q sentiment stocks\nFor large cap’s, we believe GOOGL has had high recent interest given controversy\naround Youtube ad placements. We are not sure if Google will provide clarity on the\nissue on their call, but we do expect advertisers to return by 3Q and any overhang to be\nresolved. For Amazon, the company had new revenue disclosures in its 10-K filing, and\nthere is growing optimism on advertising being a positive bottom-line driver. In SMID\nInternet, Zillow has more controversy going into 1Q as investors are once more\nconcerned about potential regulation by the CFPB limiting the ability of agents and\nmortgage brokers to co-market on the platform. We remain positive on the stock due to\nits dominant position in online real estate and our belief that the high ROI of the ad unit\n(our survey suggested >6x return) will ensure that agents buy Zillow placements\nregardless of mortgage broker incentives. Additionally, we see earnings upside potential.\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports. As a\nresult, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the\nobjectivity of this report. Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making\ntheir investment decision.\nRefer to important disclosures on page 62 to 64. Analyst Certification on page 59.

While there are no perfect indicators of average\ninvestor sentiment, we believe these metrics provide a helpful framework of investor\nsentiment in our sector. In our analysis, Facebook, WIX, and LendingTree had the highest\nsentiment in 1Q, while Fitbit, Trip and Twitter had the lowest sentiment.

Facebook moved into first place from fourth due to\nthe lowest short interest as % of float, second highest FY17 revenue growth, sixth\nhighest sell side FY16 EPS estimate revisions, and third best stock performance in the\nlast 90 days. Wix came in second place with top stock performance in the last 90 days,\ntop expected FY17 revenue growth and second best sell-side FY16 EPS estimate\nrevision, despite ranking ninth for current sell side ranking and seventh for short interest\nratio. LendingTree placed third with best current sell side ranking and best change in\nshort interest ratio.\nFitbit had third worst investor sentiment with the worst stock performance in the last\n90 days, the worst expected FY17 revenue growth and the second largest change in\nshort interest in the period. TripAdvisor, had the second lowest sentiment with the third\nworst sell side ranking and fifth worst sell side EPS estimate revision.

Looking beyond the YouTube issues, our\nearly 1Q ad checks were mostly positive, with Merkle highlighting modest revenue\ngrowth acceleration, better than the 70bps of ex-FX Website revenue deceleration in\n1Q17 (vs 4Q16) we’ve assumed in our model. Overall, we expect in-line to slightly\nbetter 1Q results driven by mobile and PLA strength (and perhaps some maps ads), but\nsee risk of moderate Street estimate cuts for 2Q/3Q revenue on YouTube concerns. For\nmost companies, we would expect management to help clear up the advertiser\ncontroversy on the call with some added financial disclosure or guidance, but predicting\nwhat Alphabet will say on the topic is more difficult.\n1Q results will be the first quarter that Google reports GAAP EPS without a non-GAAP\nEPS reconciliation. With higher than usual SBC in 1Q due to changes in grant timing, it\nis possible Google misses Street GAAP EPS. We are leaving our revenue unchanged but\nlowering GAAP EPS to $7.26 from $7.36 based on higher SBC. Also, unusual charges are\nmore likely to be controversial for Google without a non-GAAP EPS reconciliation.\nCore margins remain a key focus, as has been the case since 3Q16 when core Google\nnon-GAAP operating margins contracted 95bps y/y. We expect core margins to remain\ndown y/y driven primarily by segment mix, and our model assumes 2017 core margins\nare down 50bps in 2017 (to 46.1%) and another 20bps in 2018 (to 45.9%). For 1Q17,\nwe assume 45.8% core Google non-GAAP operating margin, up 30bps q/q and down\n75bps y/y. Our recent deep dive analysis suggests segment mix alone drives a natural\n220bps margin headwind, which we think can be partially offset with 1) upside in high\nmargin search growth from monetization growth (clicks and pricing); 2) leverage in\nindividual segments from scale; and 3) cost cutting measures across the business (see\nDigging into the Alphabet revenue mix and margin drivers).\nWe continue to like the stock, but recognize that potential estimate trimming on\nYouTube concerns, further margin contraction, SBC pressure on GAAP EPS and\nchallenging 2Q17 comps could continue to drag on near-term sentiment. Looking ahead,\nwe are optimistic on 2H17 based on the potential for new ad format ramps, easing\ncomps, and potential YouTube relief (we assume the advertiser boycott eases exiting\n2Q). Alphabet trades at 22x GAAP (17x ex-Other Bets, cash), in-line with the S&P and\nin-line to below the 5-year average (23.5x), which we view as attractive.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Website growth, core margins\nWe believe the key metrics for the quarter will be ex-FX Website growth and core\nmargins. For ex-FX website growth, we currently model 70bps of deceleration in 1Q17\n(vs 4Q16), and we think deceleration could persist through 2Q17, after which the y/y\ngrowth comps ease considerably.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 11\nChart 8: Google ex-FX Y/Y growth trends\n30%\n25%\n20%\n28%\n25%\n24%\n24% 24%\n22% 22%\n22%\n21%\n18%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\n1Q15\n2Q15\n3Q15\n4Q15\n1Q16\n2Q16\n3Q16\n4Q16\n1Q17E\n2Q17E\n3Q17E\n4Q17E\nTotal Google Revenue Y/Y (ex-FX)\nGoogle Website Y/Y (ex-FX)\nSource: Company reports, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nFor core margins, we assume y/y contraction through 3Q17, after which we model a\nslight uptick in 4Q17. For the year, we assume core Google margins contract 50bps to\n46.1%. In terms of blended Alphabet non-GAAP operating margins, we assume 70bps of\ny/y contraction to 40.7% in 2017, but won’t be surprised if better cost discipline\n(particularly in Other Bets) drives more stable y/y trends.\nTable 9: Core Google non-GAAP operating margin forecast\n1Q16 2Q16 3Q16 4Q16 1Q17E 2Q17E 3Q17E 4Q17E 1Q18E 2Q18E 3Q18E 4Q18E\nCore Google non-GAAP operating margin 46.5% 47.9% 46.5% 45.5% 45.8% 46.5% 45.6% 46.4% 45.6% 46.5% 45.4% 46.3%\nY/Y Change 1.4% 1.6% -1.0% -1.5% -0.7% -1.4% -0.9% 0.9% -0.2% -0.1% -0.2% -0.1%\nSource: Company, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Deceleration in Google Website revenue: There could be modest revenue\npressure due to YouTube boycott impact, and/or ad shift to Facebook. One SEM\nsuggested a modest uptick in advertising spend on maps, which could be a positive\nin 2017.\n• TAC to distribution partners: Rising TAC rate (Apple, Samsung) could mitigate\npotential gross revenue upside in the higher margin mobile search segment.\n• Growth investments could drag on margins: Investments in Google Cloud,\nhardware, and YouTube could be higher than we expect, which could negatively\nimpact core Google margins and raise concerns on long-term sustainable margin\nlevels.\n• YouTube/Display Network commentary: While we do not expect full resolution on\nthe YouTube/Display Network issues, management’s tone will likely impact\nexpectations for timing of a fix, corresponding costs, magnitude of the boycott\nlosses, and time to recover lost ad spend.\n• Stock comp timing shift could cause some GAAP lumpiness: Shift in timing of\nannual stock-based comp grants could impact 1Q EPS, but should be offset with\nlower relative cost in 2H17.\nTop 1Q data point:\nOur early 1Q checks (pre quarter end) have been mostly positive, but most checks did\nnot contemplate a potential impact of the YouTube & Display Network pullback.\nComScore PC click data has suggested Google PC queries are down 3% q/q QTD, slightly\nworse than the 2% q/q decline in 1Q16.\n12 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nEstimate vs Consensus\nOur revenue and EBITDA estimates of $20.2bn/$9.9bn are slightly above the Street at\n$19.9bn/$9.8bn. Our model assumes currency to be a 2% headwind on y/y international\nrevenue in 1Q17 (similar to 4Q16) and a 3% headwind in 2Q17. Our 1Q17 non-GAAP\nEPS of $9.53 is slightly above consensus at $9.45, and on a GAAP basis, our 1Q\nestimate for $7.26 is slightly below the Street at $7.42.

We are\ncomfortable with our $1,025 price objective, based on 21x core Google GAAP EPS plus\ncash. Our PO multiple is within the five year range of 12-24x forward P/E. Easing\ncomps and potential new ad format ramps (Google’s advertiser conference is May 23)\ncould be positive 2H drivers.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 13\nAmazon (Buy, $1,100 PO)\nStock view: Positive on retail, but street increasingly focused on advertising\nFor Amazon’s retail business, sentiment remains positive despite some modest 4Q\nrevenue weakness vs expectations. We expect the retail business to remain strong in\n1Q with stable growth as core drivers (Prime, delivery infrastructure advantage) remain\nintact. The lack of early tax refund support is a potential 1Q risk, but we would expect\nany delayed spending to bounce back in March or 2Q. Continued store closures by\ntraditional retailers should aid the online shift throughout 2017. Finally, it appears\nAmazon has become stepped up advertising on its site, with more sponsored listings,\nwhich could be a source of revenue upside in 2017. Amazon had new revenue\ndisclosures in its 10-K, and the ad revenue line significant accelerated in 2016.\nFor AWS, we expect some additional q/q revenue deceleration and q/q declines in\nmargins. We note that AWS growth in 4Q was below our estimates, and the effects of\n4Q’s late price cuts should drive additional deceleration in 1Q. Microsoft and Google\nare well capitalized competitors that are significantly increasing cloud investment (see\nBattle in Seattle for industry update), so the Street sentiment could shift more\ncautiously on Amazon on a slight miss.\nMargins continue to be a risk, but top line trends seem to be the biggest driver of\nsentiment and advertising optimism has grown. Amazon’s current investment cycle\nbegan in earnest in 3Q’16, and we expect the elevated pace of investment to persist\nthrough 3Q’17. Margins may see y/y declines given: 1) Ongoing investments in\nfulfillment center build out (given fulfilled unit growth of 40% in 2016), 2) Digital\ncontent and related marketing, 3) Prime benefits (Now and Fresh), 4) Alexa/Echo, and 5)\nIndia. We think the Street is constructive on these initiatives, and will move past lower\ny/y margins concerns if top line growth is stable in 1Q.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: AWS growth and 2Q profit outlook\nWe forecast 43% y/y AWS growth in 1Q, down from 47% in 4Q, partially due to the\nlingering effects of price cuts that went into effect on December 1 st . This implies 4%\nq/q growth v. 9% last quarter. Increased investments in logistics/fulfilment, AWS,\nmarketing, Prime content and others could set Amazon up for disappointing margin\nguidance vs. the Street’s expectations. However, we think the Street will focus on\nrevenue trends and ultimately view the investments as a long-term positives.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• 2Q GAAP operating income outlook given increased investments in logistics, India,\nPrime Instant Video content, as well as expected AWS deceleration\n• Gross profit growth trends given expense issues and tougher growth comps in\n1H17\n• AWS margin trends given AWS price cuts and aggressive competition\n• International segment performance given investments in India\n1Q traffic data points mixed\ncomScore’s US data indicates that Amazon PC user growth has been down 2% y/y in 1Q\nthrough February vs. 4Q at -5% y/y. Mobile user growth is up 8% y/y vs. up 9% in 4Q.\nAmazon’s total mobile and PC minutes were down 5% y/y in 1Q through February vs. up\n18% y/y in 4Q; mobile minutes were down 7% y/y in 1Q vs. +18% y/y in 4Q.\n1Q items/news:\n• Logistics investments: Amazon announced a $1.5bn air hub in Northern Kentucky\nthat will host Amazon’s own cargo airline.\n• AWS outage: AWS had a large outage in early March. Investors will likely focus on\nthe competitive implications of the outage.\n14 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\n• Walmart continuing to acquire eCommerce assets and launching free 2-day\nshipping: Investors will likely focus on Amazon’s results relative to Wal-mart.\n• Amazon Business: Amazon Business announced a multi-year agreement with a\npublic sector co-op, worth $500mn/year with a 5 year contract and 6 option years\n(see Now we’re in Business: Amazon announces new B2B contract with public\nsector co-op).\n• Prime Now expansion: Prime Now launched 1-hour delivery in Milwaukee and\nBoston during the quarter. Amazon also launched the ability for Alexa users to make\nPrime Now orders.\n• Upcoming 2Q events: AWS Summit SF (April 18-19), new Prime Instant Video\ncontent rollout (Manchester by the Sea, Bosch season 3, I Love Dick).\n• Souq.com acquisition: Amazon has an agreement to acquire Souq.com, the leading\neCommerce platform in the Middle East. Terms were not disclosed, though press\nreports indicate that Amazon had bid $650mn for the company before Emaar Malls\nmade a public bid of $800mn. The deal is expected to close in 2017.\n• Physical store rollout: Amazon has launched or planned to open 10 AmazonBooks\nstores, is beta testing its AmazonGo grocery store concept (though public opening\nwas delayed due to technology issues), and there are press reports that Amazon is\ntesting other grocery store formats as well.\n• Google Cloud Conference: No significant price announcements were made, but\nGoogle’s conference was much more impressive this year (see What a difference a\nyear makes for Google Cloud).\nSouq.com brings Amazon into the Middle East\nAmazon announced that it has an agreement to acquire Souq.com, the leading\neCommerce platform in the Middle East. Terms were not disclosed, though press\nreports indicate that Amazon had bid $650mn for the company before Emaar Malls\nmade a public bid of $800mn. This will represent Amazon’s largest deal since the\n$970mn Twitch acquisition in 2014.\nSouq.com does not disclose its sales or earnings, making it difficult to assess the\nacquisition multiple or potential accretion of the deal. An $800mn acquisition implies\n0.2% of Amazon’s current market cap. Though it is somewhat surprising for Amazon to\nacquire a company in order to enter a new market, Amazon can leverage logistics,\nsourcing, customer, and technology investments at Souq.com. The deal is expected to\nclose in 2017. Souq.com offers 8.4mn products across 31 categories, including\nelectronics, health & beauty, fashion, home goods, and baby. The site has 45mn monthly\nvisitors and localized operations in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt and localized sites for\nthe UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar. Euromonitor estimates\nthat Middle East & Africa GMV is $9bn market in 2016 though other reports peg the\nmarket at $20bn, implying roughly 1-2% eCommerce penetration in the region vs. midteens\nin Western markets. Press reports last year indicated that Amazon was exploring\nentering Australia and Singapore in 2017. The Souq.com acquisition may signal a more\naggressive global expansion plan.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Above Street revenue and EPS\nWe expect 1Q revenue/EPS of $35.3bn/$2.34 vs. Street at $35.3bn/$2.28. Amazon’s 1Q\nrevenue guidance is $33.25-35.75 and GAAP operating income of $250-900 (we are at\n$898mn in operating income). Our 1Q revenue estimate of $35.3bn (+21% y/y vs. 22%\nin 4Q16) is based on 24% y/y unit growth vs. 24% y/y in 4Q. For 1Q17, we estimate\n-19% q/q revenue growth vs -19% q/q in 1Q last year. We are below the street for 2Q\nmargins.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 15\nTable 11: Amazon Estimate Summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $35,335 $36,784 $164,532 $194,826\nGrowth Y/Y% 21% 21% 21% 18%\nStreet $35,255 $36,815 $165,158 $199,387\nBofAML vs. Street Above Below Below Below\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. $4,153 $4,626 $18,246 $22,022\nStreet $4,085 $4,835 $19,382 $24,850\nBofAML vs. Street Above Below Below Below\nEPS\nBofAML est. $2.34 $2.86 $10.90 $14.37\nStreet $2.28 $3.30 $12.60 $18.16\nBofAML vs. Street Above Below Below Below\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\nOur PO of $1,100 is based on our SOP that values AWS at $127bn or $259 per share\nand the retail business at $413bn or $841 per share. Our 5.5x AWS multiple is a modest\npremium to the software/SaaS comp group at 5.0x on 2018 sales, and 0.9x multiple is a\npremium to a retail general merchandise comp group at 0.7x. We think the premiums are\nwarranted given share gains and superior growth. Our $1,100 price objective implies\n2.8x 2018E Price/Sales, a multiple above the high end of Amazon's historical range of\n1.0-2.5x. We argue the historical P/S multiple should increase given positive 3rd party\nsales (3P) that is reported on a net basis, a higher AWS revenue contribution, an\nincreasing advertising contribution, and record gross profit margins.\n16 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\neBay (Buy, $38 PO)\nStock view: Marketplace growth should improve in 2017\neBay’s 4Q results showed signs of Marketplace improvement, with improving mobile\nand C2C trends and a modest pickup in new buyers. Management expects to put\nmarketing dollars behind this trend to drive Marketplace growth momentum in 2017\n(guidance calls for 1 point of acceleration in Marketplace volume in 1Q, with 2 points for\nthe full year). Expectations have risen since the start of the year, and we think eBay\nneeds to deliver 1 point acceleration in US GMV growth vs 1Q to maintain confidence in\nmanagement’s execution. There is also significant interest in eBay’s first party ad\nstrategy and potential improvement in transaction take rates (at expense of MS&O\nrevenues).\nThe potential structured data impact also remains top of mind for investors as\nstructured data will provide the backbone for improving customer search and product\nexperiences. As of 4Q’16, there are 180mn+ structured data pages v. 100mn+ pages at\nthe end of 3Q’16. More pages are expected in 2017, which will start to be exposed to\ncore organic traffic. Management appears confident that the impact of structured data\nwould increasingly benefit results and that structured data formats will be much more\nvisible by holiday 2017. Overall, if 1Q results are at/above expectations, we think the\nstock will reflect even more optimism on structured data improvement.\nFor margins, we expect continued pressure in 2017 as the company ramps up marketing\nspend and increases its AI capabilities. If the company can manage to accelerate top\nline growth through conversion rate improvements, some of the upside may be invested,\nlimiting 2017 earnings flow through (but benefitting growth in 2018). Therefore, we\nthink customer, transaction and revenue trends most important for 2017, but lack of\nmargin flow through could be sentiment headwind for the stock.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Marketplace growth/outlook\nOur model assumes US GMV growth of 3.5% y/y, an 80bps q/q acceleration off an 80ps\neasier y/y comp, while we anticipate 6.0% y/y Intl ex-FX GMV growth. US acceleration\n(despite a modest Leap Year headwind) is likely needed to maintain increased\nmanagement confidence. Our model assumes 8.3% take rate, which is up 10bps y/y and\ncould be aided by the early transition to 1 st party advertising on the site. eBay’s 1Q\nrevenue guide implies 5% y/y ex-FX growth at the midpoint, while the 2017 revenue\nguide calls for 7% ex-FX growth, implying revenue growth acceleration during the year.\nChart 9: eBay quarterly GMV and revenue y/y growth\n10%\n5%\n0%\n-5%\n-10%\n-15%\n-20%\n1Q15A 2Q15A 3Q15A 4Q15A 1Q16A 2Q16A 3Q16A 4Q16A 1Q17E 2Q17E 3Q17E 4Q17E\nRevenue Growth\nGMV Growth\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, company report\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Overall GMV growth remains muted as structured data changes still early, reducing\nconfidence in future improvement.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 17\n• StubHub trends as StubHub GMV comps are tough in 1H’17 (32% y/y growth in\n1H’16).\n• Marketing expenses are expected to increase, putting pressure on margins and\ncould raise concerns that GMV growth is being “bought”.\nEarly 1Q traffic data points mixed\ncomScore’s eBay desktop unique visitors decreased 6% on average through February vs.\ndown 2% in 4Q. comScore’s total eBay mobile and PC minutes declined 20% y/y on\naverage through February in 1Q vs. down 17% y/y in 4Q. comScore indicates mobile\nminutes decreased 38% vs. down 20% in 4Q.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Expect modest EPS upside\nWe expect eBay to report broadly in-line revenue/EPS estimates of $2.21bn/$0.49 vs.\nthe Street at $2.21bn/$0.48 (guidance is $2.17bn-$2.21bn and $0.46-$0.48).

O ur 17x P/E\nmultiple is slightly ahead of the retail comp group average of about 16x, reflecting\neBay's potential for a Marketplace growth acceleration (to well above average retail\ngrowth) in 2017. With 6-8% growth and an 8% FCF yield, we think eBay remains an\ninteresting value stock for retail investors, although GARP focused Internet investors\nmay prefer stronger growth at Google or Priceline.\n18 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nExpedia (Buy, $146 PO)\nStock view: 1Q faces tough comps, but should clear way for strength into ‘18\nWe think 1Q expectations are somewhat muted as Expedia has highlighted several\nearnings headwinds in early 2017, including incremental cloud migration spend, higher\nmarketing spend and, recently, potential ADR pressure. 1Q’17 earnings will face the\ntoughest room night growth comps, though Expedia expressed optimism on trends\nthrough January on the 4Q call. Comps ease during the rest of the year for Expedia,\nwhich we see as a positive set up for the stock. We think Expedia will reiterate its 10-\n15% EBITDA growth outlook and .Expedia remains our top 2017 summer (2Q/3Q) travel\nidea.\nWe currently forecast 20% y/y room night growth in 2Q/3Q, though the comp is\n1600bps easier vs. 1Q and street growth expectations could be higher. The ongoing\nbenefit of conversion rate improvements, the Easter shift into 2Q (noted as 1% impact\nin 2Q’16), as well as the benefit of more aggressive marketing spend should aid 2Q\ngrowth. Additionally, prior to 1Q’17 earnings, Expedia will begin to disclose HomeAway\nonline bookings and room nights, which we think may drive y/y room night growth 200-\n300bps higher (we forecast HomeAway room nights up 50% y/y in 2017 vs. core OTA\nroom nights up 18%). We think investors will also view HomeAway disclosure positively\nif the data indicates that the HomeAway transition remains on track and provide\nvisibility into potential EBITDA acceleration in 2018.\nSTR data suggests hotel fundamentals deteriorated modestly in the US through initial\nMarch readings, but improved slightly in Europe through February. However, Expedia’s\nCEO commented in a recent interview with the Financial Times that international\ntourism to the US (Expedia’s key market) has decelerated following the introduction of\nTrump’s travel bans, which may be a downside risk to 1Q bookings and revenues. This\nmirrors ForwardKeys data from early March that after Trump’s executive order, foreign\ntourism bookings to the US fell, then rebounded when the ban was suspended, but\ndeclined again when the ban was re-introduced. A few US hotel operators have\nindicated little impact from travel bans, so data is mixed.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: room night growth vs industry and Priceline\nWe expect 1Q organic room night growth to remain steady at 16% y/y, though we note\nthat this does not yet include the contribution from HomeAway, which we think should\nadd 200-300bps to y/y growth. We expect N. America bookings growth of 12% y/y vs.\n8% in 4Q, Int’l bookings (FX-neut.) of 14% y/y.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Room nights may disappoint on tougher 1Q comps, negatively impacting the\nacceleration thesis\n• Expedia’s CEO commented in a recent interview with the Financial Times that\ninternational tourism to the US (Expedia’s key market) has decelerated following\nthe introduction of Trump’s travel bans, which may pressure hotel ADRs and be a\ndownside risk to 1Q bookings\n• Pace of investments, namely cloud IT spend ($110mn in 2017) and marketing ramp\n• HomeAway EBITDA trends given marketing spend ramp and pressure on\nsubscription revenues. Street has high expectations for the business.\n• Pressure on hotel take rates given agency mix shift and rewards programs\nEarly 1Q RevPAR data decelerates\nAccording to STR, 1Q US RevPAR through initial March readings decelerated 30bps to\n3.0% y/y, and European RevPAR through February accelerated 600bps q/q to 3.6% y/y\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 19\n(FX-neutral). The STR data reflects a continued gradual deceleration in US RevPAR\ngrowth and a more recovery in European RevPAR growth as the region laps terrorist\nattacks and geopolitical uncertainty.\nTable 13: US and European RevPAR Y/Y Change\nUS\nJan-16 Feb-16 Mar-16 Apr-16 May-16 Jun-16 Jul-16 Aug-16 Sep-16 Oct-16 Nov-16 Dec-16 Jan-17 Feb-17\nMar-\n17** 1Q16 2Q16 3Q16 4Q16 1Q17\nOccupancy -0.3% -0.8% -0.4% 2.2% -0.5% 0.3% -1.0% -0.4% 1.6% -0.3% 2.5% -0.1% 0.5% -0.5% 1.6% -0.5% 0.7% 0.1% 0.7% 0.5%\nADR 2.8% 3.6% 3.2% 2.8% 2.4% 3.5% 3.6% 2.5% 3.9% 1.9% 3.4% 2.4% 3.2% 1.7% 2.6% 3.2% 2.9% 3.3% 2.6% 2.5%\nRevPAR 2.4% 2.8% 2.7% 5.0% 1.9% 3.8% 2.5% 2.1% 5.6% 1.6% 5.9% 2.3% 3.8% 1.2% 4.2% 2.7% 3.6% 3.4% 3.3% 3.0%\nEurope\nOccupancy 1.4% 1.5% 0.3% 3.5% -0.3% -0.7% -0.4% -1.5% 0.8% -0.4% 4.2% 4.5% 5.1% 2.9% 1.1% 0.8% -0.4% 2.8% 4.0%\nADR -4.3% -2.7% 2.5% 3.2% 0.3% -4.5% -0.7% -4.8% -1.8% -8.6% -5.3% -5.0% -2.1% -3.1% -1.5% -0.3% -2.4% -6.3% -2.6%\nRevPAR -2.9% -1.3% 2.8% 6.8% -0.1% -5.1% -1.1% -6.2% -1.0% -9.0% -1.3% -0.7% 2.9% -3.1% -0.5% 0.5% -2.8% -3.7% -0.1%\nEurope in Euros Jan-16 Feb-16 Mar-16 Apr-16 May-16 Jun-16 Jul-16 Aug-16 Sep-16 Oct-16 Nov-16 Dec-16 Jan-17 Feb-17 1Q16 2Q16 3Q16 4Q16 1Q17\nOccupancy 1.4% 1.5% 0.3% 3.5% -0.3% -0.7% -0.4% -1.5% 0.8% -0.4% 4.2% 4.5% 5.1% 2.9% 1.1% 0.8% -0.4% 2.8% 4.0%\nADR 0.0% -0.2% -1.7% -0.1% -0.9% -4.4% -2.7% -4.6% -1.6% -8.5% -5.4% -1.5% -0.9% 0.2% -0.7% -1.8% -3.0% -5.2% -0.4%\nRevPAR 1.4% 1.2% -1.4% 3.3% -1.2% -5.0% -3.1% -6.0% -0.9% -8.9% -1.4% 2.9% 4.2% 3.0% 0.4% -1.0% -3.3% -2.4% 3.6%\nSource: Smith Travel Research (STR), BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates; Note: **March data is month to date\nEstimates vs. Consensus: In-line 1Q revenue and EPS\nWe expect 1Q revenue/EPS of $2.13bn/$0.07 vs. the Street at $2.14bn/$0.06 driven by\n8% core OTA growth, 48% Trivago growth (in USD), 2% Egencia growth, and 16%\nHomeAway growth.

Early ad checks in the quarter indicate steady advertiser\ntrends, with some elements of seasonality off a stronger 4Q, and strength at Instagram.\nWe expect pricing tailwinds to begin to pick up as we approach ad inventory supply\nmoderation in 2H17, and a flurry of new product introductions could provide additional\nsources of ad load inventory over time. Overall, we see 1Q as an in-line to slightly better\nquarter, and are optimistic on the set-up for the remainder of the year for pricing,\nexpense management, user engagement, and new platforms/feature ramps. Facebook\nwill be hosting its F8 developer conference before earnings in San Jose on April 18-19.\nFacebook had another busy quarter of new product launches with a notable trend of\nSnapchat-like features (Stories, Direct ephemeral messaging) and Video. At this point,\nwe believe the Snap threat is less of a near-term concern. Recent key product/feature\nreleases include:\n• Stories for all: On the tail of a successful Instagram Stories launch in 8/16,\nFacebook rolled out WhatsApp Status (2/17), Messenger Day (3/17), and Facebook\nStories (3/17).\n• Direct ephemeral messaging: After introducing ephemeral direct photo/video\nsharing on Instagram in 11/16, Facebook announced a comparable feature with\nintegrated filters/masks/frames for the core Facebook app in 3/17.\n• Video App for TV: Announced in February, new app for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV,\nand Samsung Smart TV to enable FB video viewing on TV.\n• New ad products: Instagram Stories ads (1/17) a positive tailwind to Instagram ad\nload, while vertical video ads (Facebook 9/16, Instagram 11/16) and Collections\n(3/17) are likely positive for pricing.\nWhile, in many ways, Facebook is duplicating Snapchat’s innovation, we are encouraged\nwith the rate of new product introductions and view the Facebook Stories and Direct\nephemeral messaging (with filters/masks) as positives for user engagement and\npotential barriers to competitive risk. While management’s focus in the near-term will\nlikely be on new feature adoption, we expect Stories ads within 1-2 quarters and the\ncompany is already establishing partnerships for branded masks/filters (see More\nStories in the Snap competitive saga). Over time, we would not be surprised to see\nfilter/mask features and ads added to WhatsApp and, possibly, Messenger, which could\nunlock new monetization potential.\nOn the expense front, we continue to view management’s 2017 expense growth\nforecast (47-57%) as conservative. History would seem to suggest manage could trim\nthe top of the range on the 2Q earnings call, with more meaningful revisions in 2H17.\nThat said, we won’t be surprised if management maintains the outlook on the April call,\nparticularly given the velocity of new feature launches and potential investments in\nvideo content.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 21\nChart 10: 2017 expense forecast now reflected in estimates; potential for favorable revisions ahead\n75%\n70%\n65%\n60%\n55%\n50%\n45%\n40%\n35%\n30%\n25%\n2015A: 51%\n2016A: 41%\n2014A: 34%\n4Q13 1Q14 2Q14 3Q14 4Q14 1Q15 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 3Q16 4Q16\n2014 2015 2016 2017\nSource: Company, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q\nUnderlying MAU and DAU trends are still the key metrics for the stock, in our view. We\nassume MAUs grow 16% y/y to 1.91bn and DAUs 16% to 1.26bn, keeping DAU/MAU at\na steady 66%. It’s possible (but hard to predict) that management offers an update on\nInstagram users (600mn MAU, 400mn DAU in 4Q), and more specifically, Instagram\nStories (150mn DAU in January). On the messaging front, there could be a Messenger\nuser update (1bn as of 7/16), while a WhatsApp update is less likely (1.2bn as of 4Q16).\nWe expect ad impressions to grow 46% y/y (49% in 4Q) and ad prices to increase 2%\ny/y (3% in 4Q).\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Expense trajectory or lack of an expense guidance change could disappoint:\nWhile we continue to anticipate favorable revisions to management’s 2017 expense\nforecast in 2H, near-term adjustments may be less likely given the velocity of new\nproduct launches and potential video content investments.\n• 1Q ad revenue deceleration possible: We note that 4Q was particularly strong\nand it’s possible 1Q normalization could result in revenue growth deceleration.\n• Lack of commentary on monetization strategy: While Messenger/WhatsApp\nmonetization is likely still a 2018 story, lack of constructive commentary on timing\ncould disappoint.\n• User deceleration always a risk: MAU and DAU growth has surprised to the upside\nat mid-to-high teens y/y growth, and any meaningful slowdown could raise\ncompetitive concerns.\nTop 1Q data point: Instagram reaches 1mn advertisers\nMid-quarter data points were somewhat limited in 1Q, though management did give an\nupdate on the Instagram monetization efforts. In a March 2017 update, management\nindicated that Instagram grew to 1mn advertisers, double the number since 9/16, with\nbusiness profile pages up to 8mn from 5mn in 4Q. Facebook’s comparable metrics are\n4mn advertisers (as of 9/16) and 65mn business pages (4Q16).\nFor early advertiser checks, general feedback suggested positive trends, but more\n‘steady as it goes’ than absolute blow out. The stronger 4Q was highlighted as a tough\n22 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\ncomp, but overall demand remains robust. Instagram feedback was notably positive,\nwith many suggesting the demand is additive (not reallocation from core Facebook).\nEstimates vs Consensus\nOur 1Q17 and 2Q17 revenue and EBITDA estimates are ahead above the Street. We\nassume ~800bps of advertising growth deceleration in 3Q and another ~400bps in 4Q,\nand our 2017 estimates are also slightly above consensus. On that premise, we are\ncomfortable that Street estimates sufficiently reflect potential impact of News Feed ad\nload deceleration in 2H17.\nTable 15: Facebook Estimate Summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofA ML est. $7,905 $9,303 $38,546 $48,882\nGrowth Y/Y% 47% 45% 39% 27%\nStreet $7,798 $8,993 $37,774 $48,103\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above\nEBITDA\nBofA ML est. $4,886 $5,844 $24,358 $30,905\nStreet $4,743 $5,638 $23,775 $30,409\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above\nEPS\nBofA ML est. $1.14 $1.37 $5.67 $7.01\nStreet $1.11 $1.30 $5.43 $6.75\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above\nGAAP EPS\nBofA ML est. $0.94 $1.17 $4.86 $6.02\nStreet $0.86 $1.06 $4.45 $5.76\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\nOur $165 price objective is based on 24x our non-GAAP 2018E EPS and 27x GAAP EPS,\nmultiples equal to about 1x 2018E revenue growth, mostly in-line with its social and\nonline media peers.

We think GrubHub is well-positioned to continue to leverage these\ninvestments to drive growth in 2017 and beyond.\nGrubHub’s delivery business is reaching scale in more markets, and delivered gross food\nsales run-rate increased from $500mn in 3Q to nearly $600mn in 4Q (20% of ’16 food\nsales). Delivered orders were 40% higher than in 3Q. We think delivery will continue to\ndrive take rate higher and be EBITDA accretive by YE17 as efficiencies are gained.\nCompetition remains a key concern for investors and weighs on sentiment. However, we\nbelieve that GrubHub’s user base is sticky and its repeat order rate (>90%) is defensible.\nIn 2016, as UberEats, Amazon Prime Now, DoorDash, and Postmates invested in\nexpansion, GrubHub’s active diner growth and order growth remained solid. Google\nTrends indicates that over the past 12 months, though competitors have expanded to\nmore cities in the US, GRUB remains the overwhelming leader in the market, with both\nof its core brands (GrubHub and Seamless) many times the size of any of its\ncompetitors.\nGrubHub 1Q results may also face a modest growth headwind from warmer weather in\nkey markets like NYC and Chicago. For context, in 4Q15, GrubHub called out warmer\nweather was a 200bps y/y order growth drag (~$2mn in revenue, $12.7mn in gross food\nsales). Warmer weather can impact order volume and new diner growth, though new\ndiners can partially shift to 2Q. We forecast 26% y/y gross food sales and 36% y/y\nrevenue growth in 1Q’17.\nWe think active diner growth will accelerate in 2017 as the company invests more\nheavily in marketing and it comps out against its “quality over quantity” marketing\nstrategy started in 1Q16. Investors, however, should expect that accelerating active\ndiner growth will be counterbalance by lower order frequency as newer diners to the\nsystem tend to order less frequently. At the same time, we expect take rate will\ncontinue to expand as the delivery business grows.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: gross food sales growth\nWe forecast gross food sales growth in 1Q of 26%, a modest deceleration from 27% in\n4Q (flat with 4Q less the 1% hit from the lack of Leap Day in 1Q17). Though we think\nthere is likely upside to our forecast given a 500bps easier y/y comp in 1Q vs. 4Q. We\nexpect 1Q active diner growth of 25%, Grubs per Diner decline of 3%, and average order\nsize growth of 5%.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Despite positive Google Trends data and commentary from management, mounting\ncompetition eats away at GRUB’s growth and take rate, driving diner acquisition\ncosts higher.\n• Warmer weather during 1Q, particularly in GrubHub’s core NYC and Chicago\nmarkets, may be a headwind to growth.\n• RDS (restaurant delivery service) investments weigh on earnings at a rate higher\nthan the $3mn in EBITDA drag that we have in our model for 1Q’17.\n• Site and conversion rate improvements turn out to be one-time in nature rather\nthan an ongoing, longer-term focus for management.\n24 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\n• Marketing expense expected to ramp in 2017, which can weigh on earnings,\nespecially if gross food sales comes in weaker than anticipated.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Broadly in-line with consensus in 1Q’17\nWe expect 1Q revenue/EPS at $153mn/$0.25 vs. the Street at $153mn/$0.24 driven by\ngross food sales growth and an improving take rate.\nTable 16: GrubHub Estimate Summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $153 $159 $650 $815\nGrowth Y/Y% 37% 33% 32% 25%\nStreet $153 $158 $645 $782\nBofAML vs. Street Below Above Above Above\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. $41 $46 $184 $247\nStreet $40 $46 $181 $225\nBofAML vs. Street Above Below Above Above\nEPS\nBofAML est. $0.25 $0.29 $1.13 $1.55\nStreet $0.24 $0.28 $1.10 $1.37\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\nOur PO is $49, based on 32x our 2018E P/E (vs. high growth internet at 31x).

The incremental revenue increase combined with Core enhancements\nshould drive ARPU forward, though we are still cautious given Core’s declining to flat\ngrowth and project 1Q17 at $.0.57 (-3% y/y).\nAnother issue on the horizon for Match group is the high ownership percentage of IAC.\nBased on our discussions with management, this is a known issue from both Match and\nIAC’s perspective. The high degree of IAC ownership limits the float and has created a\ndisproportionate short interest on the company to obtain higher exposure to IAC’s core\n(ex-Match) properties. Our conversations suggest we can expect further discussion\nfrom management on ways forward in 2017, with the most likely outcome, in our view, a\nspin off IAC’s Match ownership to IAC shareholders.\nAs Tinder expands, one concern we have is that its highly diverse user base could cause\nan overload of options and limit user’s ability to find the type of matches they are\nlooking for. An “elite” version of the app was recently launched called “Select” (per\nTechCrunch), highlighting the company’s focus on making sure users are able to find\nsuitable matches in different ways.\n1Q17 should see international marketing spend on Tinder begin to pay off. We expect\nthat paid member count (PMC) will continue to trend up driven by Tinder and other\nrecent platforming initiatives helping to increase conversion on Core mobile and other\nsites like Plenty of Fish (PoF) and Meetic.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: International PMC growth\nKey for the quarter will be international PMC growth and we expect international to\ngrow 25% y/y to 2.3mn and overall PMC growth to be up 17% y/y to 5.9mn as Tinder\nmarketing outside of the US should start paying off. We are still cautious on ARPU and\nexpect modest declines of 3% y/y, we believe there is still upside potential here driven\nby Tinder Boost, released in September 2016 and Core turnaround efforts. Key issues\nfor the call will be PMC growth, Tinder monetization and Core improvements.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Decline in margins due to increased marketing of Tinder and Core improvement\n• Drop in monetization as more consumers switch to mobile from PC.\n• New investment initiatives drive down FY17 earnings projections.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Expect lower revenue, slight beat on profit\nWe are modeling rev/EBITDA of $293mn/$78.5mn below the Street due to impact of\nPrinceton Review sell off but higher on EBITDA vs. the Street’s $307mn/$77mn\nestimate. We estimate total PMCs of 5.9mn in 1Q and average revenue per users of\n$0.527 down 3% y/y due to lower monetizing Tinder plans. With the sale of Princeton\nreview closing 3/31 and management moving any income to discontinued operations,\nwe have removed all non-Dating revenue from our model and believe our treatment of\nthese discontinued operations (totally excluded from our estimates) is the reason our\nestimates are currently below the street.\n26 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nTable 17: Match estimate summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofA ML est. $293 $315 $1,285 $1,484\nGrowth Y/Y% 20% 20% 16% 15%\nStreet $308 $322 $1,325 $1,484\nBofA ML vs Street Below Below Below Above\nEBITDA\nBofA ML est. $79 $112 $462 $562\nStreet $77 $113 $459 $544\nBofA ML vs Street Above Below Above Above\nEPS\nBofA ML est. $0.14 $0.23 $0.95 $1.14\nStreet $0.13 $0.21 $0.88 $1.07\nBofA ML vs Street In-Line In-Line Above Above\nStreet EBITDA margins 25% 35% 35% 37%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 27\nNetflix (Buy, $154 PO)\nStock view: Easy comps ahead with more content on the way\nHeading into 1Q earnings, we expect Netflix to beat subscriber estimates given strong\nrecent content launches, and accelerating subscriber growth in Europe. Key 1Q titles\nincluded A Series of Unfortunate Events, 13 Reasons Why, and Marvel’s Iron Fist. We\nsee few competitive issues this quarter to impact subscriber growth and we think the\nrelease of Marvel’s Iron Fist likely helped quarter ending subscribers, despite low\nmetacritic scores. Fans of the Defender series still seem to be watching the show with\nParrot Analytics indicating viewership was just below Luke Cage its first week (though\nviewership dropped by half within the first 10 days). In addition, fan ratings came in at\n81% on Rotten Tomatoes despite the poor critic reception.\nFor 2Q, we expect a solid guide as Netflix laps 2Q16’s price increases internationally\nand in the U.S. This should help churn rates for 2Q especially in Europe where we think\nthe bulk of Netflix subscriber growth will originate for 2017. In addition, Netflix has a\nstronger slate of titles vs. 1Q including key franchises like House of Cards, Orange is the\nNew Black, Sense8, and other new series. Although competition is increasing in the\nSVOD space with Amazon, Hulu and other making original content, we still see Netflix as\nahead of the competition due to: 1) sheer volume of content production with over 1000\nhours in 2016, with strong local market content that can be leveraged globally, 2)\ncompetitive price points vs competitors; and 3) the largest volume of 4K content which\nattracts new TV purchases. 4K TVs could drive upside to estimates in FY17 as Netflix is\none of the few services with a library of 4K content.\nFor 1Q contribution margins, we estimate that Netflix will reach a new high at 41.3%\nU.S. contribution margins somewhat offset by international contribution margins which\nwe expect to close to zero at 1.5%, but still a large improvement over 4Q’s 8% loss. We\nexpect Netflix to run its International division at new break even margins through FY17\nand begin to gradually lift international margins in 2018. As Netflix reaches Intl\nprofitability, the investor story may focus more on EPS growth in the coming years.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Net sub adds internationally and 2Q guide\nFor 1Q we see two critical metrics that we think the Street will focus on; 1) Net Intl.\nsubscriber additions as Netflix laps the launch in 130 countries globally; and 2) 2Q net\nsubscriber guide for Netflix in the U.S. Although 1Q domestic subscriber ads are\nimportant, we think the Street would be willing to look past a lower domestic number on\nstronger international growth. In 2Q Netflix could potentially hit a flat subscriber\ngrowth quarter as 2Q is typically seasonally weak, though we note the content slate for\n2Q16 has several top franchises with new seasons.\nChart 11: Domestic subscribers\nChart 12: International subscribers\n60,000\n50,000\n40,000\n30,000\n20,000\n10,000\n0\n18%\n16%\n14%\n12%\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n70,000\n60,000\n50,000\n40,000\n30,000\n20,000\n10,000\n0\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\nU.S. Subs (000's)\nY/Y Growth\nInternational Subs (000's)\nY/Y Growth\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, company report\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, company repor\n28 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nBiggest issues/risks:\n• Low reviews scores on Iron Fist effecting fan churn and causing some to question\nNetflix’s ability to continue creating hit series\n• Marketing spend in 1Q to drive subscriber growth\n• Lower than expected contribution margins as Netflix invests in content.\n• Content spending impact on FCF\nTop 1Q data points: Traffic gains on PC\nIn the U.S., comScore reported quarter to date (Jan. and Feb.) average unique desktop\nvisitors up down 2% y/y to 40.5 million compared to 4Q up 22% y/y or 47 million, while\nmobile unique users were flat y/y at 29.4mn users vs. up 19% y/y in 4Q. We note recent\ncomScore changes heavily impacted the y/y comparable data for several companies\nincluding Netflix, in addition Comscore Data is PC only which is likely less relevant given\nthat a large portion of Netflix viewing is through connected TVs/devices.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: In-line on revenue, slightly below on EPS\nOur 1Q rev/GAAP EPS estimates of $2.71bn/$0.39 are above the Street’s estimates of\n$2.64bn/$0.37. We estimate total domestic subs of 51.1 million, domestic DVD subs of\n4 million, and international streaming subs of 48.3 million. Netflix a solid line up of\npopular content in 2Q, especially May where it has Sense8 Season 2, Unbreakable\nKimmy Schmidt Season 3, War Machine (Movie), House of Cards Season 5 in May, and a\nremake of Anne of Green Gables and Orange is the New Black in June which will likely\nhelp U.S. domestic subscriber total stay positive in 2Q. In addition, we expect lower y/y\nchurn rates to potentially help subscriber growth.\nTable 18: Netflix estimate summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $2,710 $2,854 $11,627 $13,937\nGrowth Y/Y% 38% 35% 32% 20%\nStreet $2,644 $2,760 $11,221 $13,448\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. $331 $306 $1,218 $1,758\nStreet $308 $245 $1,053 $1,710\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nGAAP EPS\nBofAML est. $0.39 $0.30 $1.19 $2.04\nStreet $0.37 $0.23 $1.09 $1.98\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, company report\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 29\nPandora (BUY, $9 PO)\nStock view: Focus on on-demand product, but questions on growth\nPandora’s recently launched on-demand subscription product will likely be the focus of\n1Q investor call. Although the product is on limited release, we expect investor to focus\non initial reception of the product (positive reviews in media) and whether Pandora is\ncapable of growing the subscription base to 10mn over the next several years. Initially\nPandora will not likely see an impact on revenue from premium subscriptions as it is\ngiving current Pandora One subscribers a free six month trail of Pandora Premium which\nmay also impact subscription revenue for 1Q.\nFrom our initial time with Pandora Premium, we found playlist creation smooth and easy\nto use with Pandora quickly auto-filling play lists after picking a few songs, but Pandora\nlacks the curated playlist selection found in Apple music and Spotify and we\nencountered some missing songs/artists from the on-demand platform. The real\nquestion will be whether Pandora’s platform is 1) good enough to pull exiting ondemand\nusers from other services to Pandora (Pandora indicated roughly 60% of\nPandora users are using another on-demand service); 2) can it convince people to\nupgrade from free Pandora to Pandora Premium; and 3) how will Pandora grow its active\nlistener base from here. Pandora has had a largely stagnate active user base over the\nlast year and we think even with the new on-demand product could face difficulty\ngrowing its users, especially as it increases its ad loads in key markets.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Ad rate growth and sub metrics\nPandora began rolling out Pandora Premium on March 15 th , and we think key questions\nfor the call will be; 1) initial reception of Pandora Premium; 2) when it will be fully\navailable to all users; 3) will Pandora Premium driving increased users; and 4) how have\nad load changes be received by free users. Pandora is increasing its ad load per hour to\nincrease its RPM rates, but this also risks alienating its already stagnant to declining\nuser base from the platform. 1Q will be the first measure to see if Pandora is able to\nincrease ad loads while maintaining its user base, the first step in stronger monetization\nof its differentiated ad-supported radio product.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Investment spending in quarter and outlook for future S&M/R&D spend;\n• Outlook for when Pandora will reach profitability again.\n• Active listener or listening hour declines due competition;\n• Commentary on outlook for Pandora Premium\nTop 1Q data points: Triton Internet radio data\nTriton media releases Internet radio metrics which give an initial read into the quarter,\nbut is limited to January data, Triton data shows Avg. Active sessions (analogous to\nlistening hour growth) declined 3% y/y which is tracking below our 1% y/y listener hour\ngrowth est. of 5.58 billion hours. Session starts were up 4% y/y above our est. of 1% y/y\nactive user growth. We note that Spotify is now tracking more session starts than\nPandora implying market share loss to Spotify. Given the leap year, we would expect\nFebruary to track down Y/Y for monthly active listeners and user growth in February.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Slightly above on revenue, below on EPS\nOur rev/Non-GAAP EPS est. of $319mn/($0.49) is slightly above on revenue, but in-line\non EPS compared to the Street est. at $318mn/($0.39). We model total listener hours\nat 5.58bn and total RPM rates of $52. Our FY16 est. are slightly above on revenue, but\nwell above on EPS as we expect losses this year to improve in 2H16 as Pandora builds\nup subs, but still see Pandora failing to gain much leverage from increased R&D\nspending and S&M spend. We maintain our $9 PO, based on 1x our 2018 revenue\nestimate, a discount to peers, but justified in our view as Pandora is likely to have a\ndifficult transition year as it builds it on-Demand service.\n30 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nTable 19: Pandora estimate summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $319 $397 $1,629 $2,036\nGrowth Y/Y% 18% 25%\nStreet $318 $390 $1,621 $2,050\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Below\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. -$73 $1 -$17 $25\nStreet -$73 -$16 -$38 $79\nBofAML vs. Street In-line Above Above Below\nEPS\nBofAML est. -$0.49 -$0.04 -$0.21 -$0.19\nStreet -$0.35 -$0.14 -$0.49 -$0.03\nBofAML vs. Street Below Above Above Below\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg\nChart 13: Listening hours and active users trends are essentially flat.\n12%\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n1Q15 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 3Q16 4Q16 1Q17E2Q17E3Q17E4Q17E\n-2%\n-4%\nListening Hours Y/Y Growth\nActive Listners Y/Y Growth\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, company report\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 31\nPriceline (Buy, $1,920 PO)\nStock view: Expect solid 1Q top-line, but 2Q can be rough for guidance\nPriceline’s metric trends and commentary, along with 1Q booking and room night\nguidance, indicate that the company continues to capture strong market share growth in\nthe category, with little impact from hotel direct booking initiatives or competitive OTA\nmarketing spend. We expect a strong 1Q, with perhaps a little less upside than usual\ndue to the late 4Q reporting date.\nLooking forward to 2Q, we have our usual caution on guidance as 2Q is the most backend\nloaded quarter for bookings and revenues. However, in 2017 the Easter shift is a\npositive factor and will help 2Q revenues and earnings. We also expect 1Q bookings and\nroom night growth upside to translate into higher 2Q gross profit growth, and\nmanagement indicated that there is less marketing ROI pressure expected in 1H'17 than\nin 2H'16. Overall, we expect Priceline’s strong business trends to continue, and would\nuse extra conservatism in guidance as a buying opportunity.\nGiven strong execution and higher exposure to more fragmented International markets,\nPriceline remains our top long-term idea in Online travel. However, on a near-term\nbasis, we think Expedia could see a bigger stock benefit from an acceleration in room\nnight growth over the summer.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Room night growth\nWe expect Priceline to report 26% y/y room night growth (deceleration v. 31% in 4Q),\nahead of the company’s outlook of 20-25% hotel room night growth.

The 2H16 DAU slowdown has raised concerns in terms of both competitive risk\nand execution, so user trends could be the most important metric in the quarter. At this\npoint, it’s difficult to gauge relative impact of Facebook / Instagram competition,\nAndroid technical issues, product cycle lumpiness, and seasonality to the recent\nslowdown. Nonetheless, our sense is that DAU expectations are around 164-166mn, and\nwe’d expect variability (higher or lower) to have a meaningful impact on stock\nsentiment.\nIn terms of the P&L, we expect a slight q/q decline in revenue per normal seasonality\nand are modeling down 1% q/q (consistent with comments in the prospectus filing).\nWhile we can appreciate the momentum of the API roll-out with several new\npartnerships announced in January, our checks suggest most programs are early stage\nwith limited volume to date. Considering the rest of the P&L, we expect a fairly messy\nquarter between deal costs, the CEO stock award, and a catch-up RSU stock comp\nexpense. As we do not anticipate non-GAAP profitability until 2H19, we expect\ntraditional P&L metrics will be less of a focus in the coming quarters.\nWe recently initiated coverage with a Neutral and $25 price target (please see User\noverhang unlikely to be resolved in a Snap – Initiate at Neutral with $25 PO). Social\nmedia sector history suggests a wide range of possible outcomes for Snap and, as such,\nnear-term lumpiness in metrics could result in high volatility for the stock. We also note\nthat lock-up overhang could drag on near-term performance into the first lock-up\nexpiration on 7/29.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: DAUs, ARPU, and competition\nWe believe the key metric for the quarter will be the DAU number, which we model at\n166mn (up 8mn q/q, 36% y/y). We believe DAU headwinds may peak 1H17 as the\ncompany is facing an onslaught of competitive products (see More Stories in the Snap\ncompetitive saga), technical challenges with Android (from Memories), and seasonality\nentering the summer. We model ARPU at $1.01 (down 5% q/q), with North America\nARPU at $2.03 (down 7% q/q). We won’t be surprised to see upside in ARPU driven by\nad load growth and higher user engagement, though competitive pricing could\npotentially offset.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• DAU deceleration on share loss: Anything short of 164mn will likely be met with\nskepticism as investors extrapolate recent trends in considering competitive\nresilience vs Instagram, Facebook, and others. Management will likely address the\nAndroid technical issues impact on DAUs.\n• Aggressive pricing could drive short term growth but have mixed perception:\nTwitter noted elevated competition and potentially aggressive pricing surfacing in\nmid-January, which aligns well with Snap’s API update.\n• Lack of visibility into pipeline: While we don’t necessarily expect new product\nannouncements, lack of color/visibility on the product pipeline could disappoint.\n• Results could leave investors looking for more disclosure: We are not sure what\ndisclosure Snap will provide on results, and important trending info (like average\nminutes per user) could be lacking.\nTop 1Q data points: comScore suggests some gains for Instagram\nWhile comScore data is not consistent with reported minutes, it is useful for relative\ncomparisons. The data puts Snapchat minutes per user well above Twitter, but still\n34 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\ntrailing Instagram and Facebook. Interestingly, after Snapchat passed Instagram in early\n2016 in average minutes per user, Instagram recaptured the lead mid-year and has\nextended it since. While the cause for the shift is not certain, the trends align with the\nlaunch of Instagram Stories (August 2016) as well as some technology challenges on the\nSnapchat front (Android). Regardless of the near-term lumpiness, we believe overall\ndaily engagement puts Snapchat in a strong position to capture emerging online\nmarketing ad budgets.\nTable 23: Average minutes per user trend\nAug-2016 Sep-2016 Oct-2016 Nov-2016 Dec-2016 Jan-2017 Feb-2017\nSnapchat 267 267 272 269 271 254 211\nInstagram 292 294 325 337 322 357 318\nFacebook 769 766 855 826 781 827 700\nTwitter 143 149 139 114 108 128 110\nSource: comScore, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nChart 14: Instagram vs Snapchat average monthly minutes per visitor\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n2/14\n4/14\n6/14\n8/14\n10/14\n12/14\n2/15\n4/15\n6/15\n8/15\n10/15\n12/15\n2/16\n4/16\n6/16\n8/16\n10/16\n12/16\n2/17\nSnapchat\nInstagram\nSource: comScore\nEstimates vs Consensus\nOur 1Q revenue estimate of $163mn (down 1% q/q) is slightly above consensus at\n$158mn (down 5%), but we note the range of estimates is considerable ($130-196mn)\nand some checks suggest that Snap was aggressive with advertisers in 1Q.

However, we think most\nTripAdvisor visitors (399mn average monthly unique visitors in 2017 and 148mn\naverage monthly hotel shoppers) still view the site as a review/research portal, and\nchanging customer behavior will be quite difficult, particularly as we do not think\nTripAdvisor has clarified its value proposition for shoppers.\nWhile we think that TripAdvisor’s elevated marketing spend in 2017 will drive a rebound\nin traffic, we anticipate a poor ROI. Marketing expense continues to ramp as Instant\nBook rolls out, though traffic growth slows, implying more costly traffic acquisition. In\n4Q’16, Sales & Marketing as a % of sales increased to 52.8% vs. 45.6% in 4Q’15, and\nwe think TripAdvisor essentially bought desktop Hotel Shopper traffic, though likely at\npoor ROI. However, higher marketing spend in 2017 does not yet include potential for a\nlikely return to expensive brand ad campaigns. In our brand ad spend scenario analysis,\nwe expect still more downside to estimates (see Taking a look at TripAdvisor’s potential\nbrand ad spend).\nThe company is encouraged by Revenue per Hotel Shopper growth continuing to\nimprove from down 21% y/y in 1Q. We expect growth continues its improvement trend\nin 2017. However, if monetization trends decelerate, earnings downside could be\nsignificant. We think it will be difficult for TripAdvisor’s Hotel revenue to return to\ngrowth next year, let alone double-digit y/y growth, given the mobile monetization\nheadwinds. However, if the company invests heavily in traffic acquisition, particularly on\nhigher monetizing desktop, revenue and traffic growth may reaccelerate meaningfully in\n2017, though with ongoing pressure on margins.\nChart 15: Quarterly revenue and Sales & Marketing per Hotel Shopper y/y growth\nY/Y Growth\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n-10%\n-20%\n-30%\nRevenue per Hotel Shopper\nS&M per Hotel Shopper\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, company report\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Update on ad spend targets, 2017 guidance\nTRIP’s outlook for 2017 is based on “prioritizing revenue growth as opposed to profit\ngrowth,” which implies far lower marketing return expectations. However, TRIP notes\nthis expectation for marketing spend does not include potential for a return to brand\nmarketing, which could be an incremental $50-70mn headwind in ’17, in our view.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Marketing spend: TripAdvisor has prioritized revenue growth at the expense of\nearnings, implying poor marketing ROI. The biggest issue facing TripAdvisor is if it\ndecides to pursue an expensive brand/TV marketing campaign which would further\ndrive further earnings downside.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 37\n• Instant Book impact: The Instant Book transition could impact meta rates and total\nmonetization as more hotel shoppers flow through large OTA partners.\n• Hotel Shopper growth: Given elevated marketing spend, we expect to see a rebound\nin hotel shopper and hotel revenue growth. 4Q16 hotel shopper growth accelerated\nfrom 3% in 2Q-3Q16 to 8%. We expect hotel shopper growth to decelerate slightly\nto 6% in 1Q17 on a 200bps tougher y/y comp.\n1Q traffic data points: comScore indicates solid mobile and PC user growth\nIn the US, comScore reported quarter to date through February, average monthly unique\nvisitors of 31mn on PC and 56mn on mobile, up 24% and up 3% y/y, respectively.\nTripAdvisor total minutes in 1Q through February is up 10%, with mobile minutes up 5%\nand PC minutes up 17%. In our view, TripAdvisor’s elevated marketing spend YTD likely\ntargets higher monetizing PC traffic.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Broadly in-line on Revenue, below on EBITDA/EPS\nOur 1Q revenue estimate of $379mn is broadly in line with the Street at $377mn.

Though there are concerns over the company’s large\nmarketing spend (80-85% of revenue), we think the Street will view Trivago’s results\npositively given continued revenue ramp while also achieving profitability. The stock\nremains highly volatile given the limited float. Commentary during 4Q’16 earnings from\nTrivago’s key customers Expedia and Priceline (as well as from TripAdvisor) indicated\nthat paid traffic has been growing faster than free traffic, and that companies in the\nsector planned to ramp ad spend to drive continued traffic growth, which is a positive\nfor Trivago.\nTrivago has best-in-class revenue growth, with 2017 revenue growth expected at 47%\n(vs. guidance of 45%+), led by 50% qualified referral growth. We also expect Trivago will\nbecome more efficient with advertising and start to reap the benefits of past brand\nadvertising, with return on advertising spend (ROAS) improving across regions in 2017,\na key driver of modestly improving EBITDA margin from 3.7% in 2016 to 3.9% in 2017.\nThe company remains in growth mode, led by click revenue growth in ROW and\nAmericas regions, as Trivago is driving brand awareness outside its key European\nfoothold through aggressive brand marketing. The company is adding qualified referrals\nat an accelerating rate as it expands beyond its core Developed Europe markets and\npenetrates new markets. We think the company has significant runway for growth and\ncan sustain 30%+ revenue growth through the end of the decade. As the business\nmatures in its new Americas and ROW markets, we expect a better balance between\nprofit and growth. We think EBITDA margins should accelerate as the company\nleverages ‘16 and ‘17 marketing spend, with greater uplift in ‘18.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Qualified referral growth\nWe forecast 56% qualified referral growth in 1Q (920bps deceleration on 730bps\ntougher y/y comp), led by 38% y/y growth in Developed Europe, 48% in Americas, and\n110% in ROW. We expect continued robust marketing spend will drive user growth.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Weak return on advertising spend (ROAS) may be an earnings headwind.\nCompetition in the company’s advertising channels may result in lower ROI trends.\nThe company may also see less efficient advertising in newer, less mature markets.\n• A positive update to 2017 guidance may be expected. Trivago currently expects\ntotal revenue growth of 45%+ and adjusted EBITDA margin is guided to flat to\nslightly up vs. 2016’s 3.7%.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Expect revenue in-line vs. the Street, EBITDA ahead\nFor 1Q, we expect revenue/EBITDA of €241mn/(€12mn) vs. the Street at\n€241mn/(€10mn). We expect 2017 and 2018 revenue and EBITDA to come above the\nStreet and expect there is room for upside to management’s 2017 revenue growth and\nEBITDA margin guidance.\nTable 26: Trivago Estimate Summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018 2019\nRevenue\nBofAML est. €241 €281 €1,105 €1,498 €1,984\nGrowth Y/Y% 52% 57% 47% 36% 32%\nStreet €241 €270 €1,088 €1,497 €2,035\nBofAML est. vs. Street Below Above Above Above Below\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. €12 €6 €44 €127 €262\nStreet €10 €6 €40 €98 €197\nBofAML est. vs. Street Above Below Above Above Above\nEPS\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 39\nTable 26: Trivago Estimate Summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018 2019\nBofAML est. €0.02 €0.00 €0.05 €0.22 €0.48\nStreet €0.02 €0.01 €0.06 €0.15 €0.32\nBofAML est. vs. Street Above Below Below Above Above\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\nOur PO of $15 is based on a 3.5x 2018E EV/Sales multiple.

Wayfair also attributed weak guidance to caution on the retail\nenvironment and added investment. Growth comps ease in 2Q/3Q, and there is potential\nfor more stable growth in 2Q guidance to drive improving investor sentiment.\nAs for margins, management guided to EBITDA margin of (3.5%)-(3.8%), a deceleration\nfrom (2.8%) in 1Q’16 due to a lower opex absorption in the quarter on seasonally lower\nsales. The US is expected to swing back to EBITDA losses in 1Q’17, while Intl losses are\nexpected to remain steady. We forecast EBITDA margin of (2.4%), with (0.2%) EBITDA\nmargin in the US and (19.0%) margin in International. The company continues to expect\nlittle to no ad spend leverage given increase International ad spend.\nManagement historically builds conservativism into its guidance and, until last year, had\na track record of beating the upper end of its sales outlook by ~10%. Recently, revenue\nhas been by a low-single digit percentage. Our above consensus 1Q revenue forecast\nimplies 1% upside to the high end of the guidance range, in line with the trend over the\npast 3 quarters. We think investors expect sales growth above the guidance range as\nwell.\nTable 27: Revenue and EBITDA Guidance vs. Actuals\n4Q14 1Q15 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 3Q16 4Q16 1Q17E**\nRevenue - High End of Guidance $370,000 $390,000 $440,000 $525,000 $665,000 $700,000 $785,000 $850,000 $960,000 $930,000\nRevenue Actual $408,619 $424,371 $491,752 $593,972 739,790 747,348 786,928 861,525 984,559 943,626**\nRevenue Upside $38,619 $34,371 $51,752 $68,972 $74,790 $47,348 $1,928 $11,525 $24,559 $13,626\nRevenue % Upside 10% 9% 12% 13% 11% 7% 0% 1% 3% 1%\nEBITDA - High End of Guidance % -4.5% -3.5% -2.5% -0.8% -0.8% -3.0% -3.2% -4.3% -2.8% -3.5%\nEBITDA - High End of Guidance ($16,650) ($13,650) ($11,000) ($3,938) ($4,988) ($21,000) ($25,120) ($36,125) ($26,400) ($32,550)\nEBITDA Actual ($7,218) ($12,340) ($4,972) ($1,445) $2,828 ($20,960) ($24,857) ($30,849) ($12,026) ($22,463)**\nEBITDA Upside $9,432 $1,310 $6,028 $2,493 $7,816 $40 $263 $5,276 $14,374 $10,087\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Wayfair\nNote: * 1Q17E Actuals are current BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts\nOver the past two quarters, Wayfair has expressed caution on the macro environment,\nthough this proved to be somewhat unwarranted in 4Q. According to February 2017\naggregated BAC credit and debit card data, furniture sales were up 1.3% (down 0.4% on\nrolling 3-month m/m basis), while home goods were down 1.2% y/y and flat on a rolling\n3 month m/m basis. Please see the BofA Merrill Lynch US Economics team's report for\nadditional commentary on broader retail trends and a detailed explanation of the\nmethodology and limitations in connection with BAC data. Williams-Sonoma reported\ndisappointing 4Q earnings (March 15 th report) and provided modest 1Q guidance that\nthe BofA Merrill Lynch Hardline Retail team called “a little rich,” though it is difficult to\ntell if weak trends are the result of secular home goods weakness or the disruptive\nimpact of eCommerce players like Wayfair.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: 2Q revenue guidance on easier y/y comps\n1Q revenue guidance was a disappointment, though comps ease in 2Q’17, and\nopportunity for more stable US growth could aid stock sentiment.

Overall, revenue growth faces a 1600bps easier y/y comp. and would expect\nguidance anywhere near the Street’s 2Q estimate at 25% y/y growth to be viewed\npositively given several quarters of guidance below street estimates.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 41\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Commentary on US customer trends, particularly repeat rates and unit economics\n(customer acquisition costs).\n• AOV trends given street concerns that some customer metrics are benefitting from\npurchase of lower value items.\n• Progress with International investments, especially early results from ad spending in\nUK, Canada, and Germany.\n1Q data points indicate mixed traffic trends\nUS data indicates that Wayfair PC minutes growth increased 17% y/y in 1Q through\nFebruary vs. 14% y/y growth in 4Q’16. Wayfair mobile minutes have decreased 24% y/y\nthrough February in 1Q vs. up 3% y/y in 4Q’16. US PC user growth decreased 16% y/y in\n1Q through February, vs. 4Q at -25% y/y. Wayfair mobile user growth increased 2% y/y\nin 1Q through February vs. 16% y/y in 4Q.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Expect revenue and EPS upside vs. the Street\nFor 1Q, we expect revenue/EBITDA of $944mn/($22mn) vs. the Street at\n$933mn/($32mn). Total revenue guidance of $905-930mn implies 2-year stacked\ngrowth of 97-101% vs. 121% in 2016, which seems conservative. We expect the\ncompany’s revenue to come in above the high end of the sales outlook as Direct\nRevenue sales were up 30% quarter to date (through nearly 2 months of 1Q’17). Our\n1Q revenue growth forecast is based on 48% y/y customer growth (up 9% q/q) and 42%\norder growth (down 10% q/q). Wayfair expects EBITDA margin of (3.5%)-(3.8%) due to a\nlower opex absorption in the quarter on seasonally lower sales. The company continues\nto expect little to no ad spend leverage given increase International ad spend.\nTable 28: Wayfair Estimate Summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018 2019\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $944 $980 $4,169 $5,019 $5,872\nGrowth Y/Y% 26% 25% 23% 20% 17%\nStreet $933 $987 $4,237 $5,258 $6,585\nBofAML vs. Street Above Below Below Below Below\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. -$22 -$19 -$48 $10 $64\nStreet -$32 -$20 -$59 $23 $134\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Below Below\nEPS\nBofAML est.

Our\n0.7x target multiple is a discount to Wayfair’s eCommerce comp group at 1.3x and at a\nmodest discount to a retail peer comp group at 0.8x. We think the multiple is\nappropriate given strong revenue growth vs. peers, balanced by lower profitability.\n42 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nTwitter (Underperform, $14.50)\nStock view: Engagement could be improving, but still trailing peers\nOn positive note, DAU growth, tweet impressions, and time spent growth have all been\naccelerating, and we won’t be surprised if most metrics show stable growth in 1Q17\ngiven event activity (political, sports, awards shows) in 1Q. However, the NFL season is\nover, the election surprise is slowing fading, competitive pressure is rising (particularly\nInstagram), and new monetization initiatives will take time, so we are more cautious on\n2Q. The high level of executive churn also raises an element of strategic uncertainty\nthat could continue to weigh on sentiment. While it’s possible Twitter could see\nmoderate residual benefit from recent YouTube/Google Display Network boycotts, we\ncontinue to believe MAU growth acceleration is key to improving sentiment, and we\ncontinue to expect other platforms to grow much faster. The biggest upside driver for\n1Q could be conservative guidance, which implied revenues would be down 17% y/y at\nthe midpoint in 1Q.\nLonger-term, our primary concerns are user growth, rising competition in video, and lack\nof positive advertiser feedback. Despite execution on the live streaming initiative in\n2016, MAU impact was underwhelming and we see risk of rising costs and/or content\nloss in 2017. At this point, it’s unclear how aggressively management will push live\nstreaming in 2017, and early exploration of potential subscription revenue streams\n(enhanced Tweetdeck offering beta) could suggest potential strategic shifts. On the\nadvertiser side, we are still hearing limited traction with Twitter’s ad platform changes\nand ROI measurement, and it seems experimental dollars are being moved to Snap.\nThe biggest risk to our Underperform rating, in our view, is the underlying value of the\nTwitter platform for users and potential Artificial Intelligence (AI) signals. We remain on\nthe sideline for now, with ever-present M&A potential providing some element of a floor\nto the stock. We think 3x 2017 revenues plus cash ($12/share in total) is a valuation an\nacquirer could see as very reasonable given stabilizing DAU trends and value of Twitter\ndata.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Mgmt focus on engagement, investors on users\nMAU growth likely remains the primary focus in terms of metrics investors consider.\nWhile DAU growth could continue to growth at high single digits, we do not see much\nupside potential to low single digit MAU growth (we model 322mn, 4% y/y), which lags\nin comparison to Facebook’s recent17% y/y growth. We expect engagement metrics in\ngeneral (tweet impressions, DAU growth, time spent) to be solid, though it’s possible\nlack of NFL and fading US election catalysts could have some negative effect. In terms\nof monetization, our ARPU estimate for $1.67 implies a 14% y/y decline, which reflects\nboth weaker Twitter pricing trends and potential competitive pricing pressures.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• MAU growth could slip: We model 4% y/y MAU growth to 322mn, but fading NFL\nand election tailwinds could lead to weaker user growth trends in 2Q.\n• Competition could impact pricing: Management noted elevated competition in\nmid-January (shortly after Snap’s ad API update), which may have continued\nthroughout the quarter and impacted pricing more than anticipated.\n• Live streaming pipeline in question: Amazon recently announced a deal with the\nNFL to steam game content, replacing Twitter.\n• Ad product wind-down could impact revenue: Management indicated that it is\nreevaluating lower return ad formats, and a decision to wind down certain formats\n(like direct response, promoted tweets) could further impact 2Q guidance.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 43\nTop 1Q data points\ncomScore mobile data indicated US monthly active users were up 2% y/y and down 4%\nq/q (down 3mn q/q), versus our estimate for +4% y/y, +1% q/q. Total minutes for 1Q17\n(2-mo. data) are tracking down 18% y/y, with mobile down 18% and desktop down 23%.\nMobile minutes have averaged a 20% y/y decline for the last 4 months.\nEstimates vs Consensus\nOur 1Q17 rev/EPS estimates for $535mn/$0.03 are slightly above the Street and above\nthe implied midpoint of management’s guidance (based on EBITDA and EBITDA margin\noutlook). Despite our near-term concerns, we believe the outlook was sufficiently\nconservative. That said, we see risk to current consensus estimates for the year, and we\nare below Street revenue at $2.3bn for 2017 vs consensus at $2.35bn, though slightly\nahead on EBITDA on more moderate cost assumptions.

We believe the Twitter platform has slowing\nuser and revenue growth and as such, we expect the stock to trade at a sustained\ndiscount to online media peers, with potential M&A adding some offsetting downside\nsupport.\n44 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nYelp (Neutral, $43 PO)\nStock view: Likely to be some improvement vs last quarter\nYelp is coming off of a quarter with decelerating app unique devices, weak new\ncustomer adds, and decelerating sales force growth, and it seems likely that one or two\nof these metrics will improve. The tone at our recent investor meetings with the CFO\nseem to suggest that 4Q issues did not signal a break in the model (see On the road\nwith Yelp), and we expect an improvement q/q customer adds. We think the company\nshould be able achieve Street 1Q revenue and EBITDA estimates, though we won’t be\nsurprised to see the 2Q17 outlook come in slightly below current Street estimates.\nFor the full year outlook, while we believe the implied expense growth in the 2017\noutlook is somewhat conservative, management appears focused on investing in the\nbusiness for now and we think upside is more likely to come in 2Q or 3Q. Overall, we\nremain somewhat cautious on the stock given potential revenue deceleration due to\ntough comps and a deceleration in sales force growth.\nOn the cost front, management has been clear in its intention to invest in performance\nmarketing, which could take time to bear fruit. In addition, we believe sales force growth\nto stabilize/increase going forward, which would seem to suggest potential cost\nheadwinds relative to recent quarters. Finally, while we don’t have the specific\nfinancials, the addition of Nowait ($40mn acquisition closed 2/28) likely encompasses a\nmoderate bump up in opex with limited revenue to offset.\nAs we look ahead, we are encouraged with the three transitions within company and we\nwill be looking for progress on the following on the call. The first is connections\nbetween consumers and businesses on Yelp through clicks, reservation services,\nordering, and Request a Quote. The second is a ramp up in performance marketing as\nusers engage in more measurable events. The third is new customer acquisition via\nalternative channels, including national customers from outside sales alongside selfserve\ncustomers via online channels.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: new account adds, app unique devices growth\nGiven the miss last quarter and pressure on sales force headcount, local advertising\naccounts will be important gauge of overall execution. Other key metrics include app\nunique devices growth, which has been decelerating since mid-2015 from 51% y/y to\n20% in 4Q16. Performance marketing could reverse the trend, but it could take some\ntime. Finally, while management continues to highlight a decoupling of sales force\ngrowth and topline trends, investors still pay attention to overall sales force growth,\nparticularly given the three consecutive quarters of deceleration from 44% y/y (1Q16) to\n11% y/y (4Q17). Management has indicated that sales force growth in 2017 should be\nin the double digits.\nTable 30: Key 1Q metrics\nMetrics 4Q16A 1Q17E 2Q17E\nClaimed Local Business 3,363 3,552 3,727\ny/y Growth 27% 25% 24%\nLocal Advertising Accounts 138 142 150\ny/y Growth 24% 17% 17%\nReviews 121,022 127,135 133,635\ny/y Growth 27% 25% 23%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, company reports\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• Local revenue deceleration: We assume 750bps of y/y growth deceleration in\n1Q17 vs 4Q16.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 45\n• Metrics could remain under pressure: Investors likely will look for stabilization in\nkey metrics such as app unique devices growth and local ad account growth, but it\ncould take time for incremental marketing and sales investments to bear fruit.\n• Stock comp could create overhang: With Alphabet’s decision to only report GAAP\nprofits, Yelp’s high stock comp (67% of 2017E EBITDA) could create overhang to\nthe valuation.\nLeading indicator data points:\nSalesforce growth decelerating\nWhile it possible that Yelp sees improving productivity per salesperson, and the mix shift\nto national and self-serve reduces reliance on direct sales, the deceleration in salesforce\nheadcount is a negative leading indicator for revenues.\nChart 16: Salesforce growth versus local advertising revenue growth\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n1Q14A\n2Q14A\n3Q14A\n4Q14A\n1Q15A\n2Q15A\n3Q15A\n4Q15A\n1Q16A\n2Q16A\n3Q16A\n4Q16\n1Q17E\n2Q17E\n3Q17E\nSalesforce y/y % Salesforce y/y % ( 2-qtr shift) Local ad rev y/y %\nSource: Company, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nAccrued sales bonus and commissions tracking lower\nWe note that 4Q accrued bonuses and commissions are down y/y and reflect only 0.3%\nof NTM revenue, which would be the lowest ratio seen in recent years. Even on an\nabsolute basis, the total accrued bonuses and commissions of $3.1mn is the lowest\nsince mid-2013.

This reflects a moderate deceleration in mobile from 4Q (+4%) and slightly lower\ndeclines in desktop (4Q at -16%). Total QTD US minutes are down 6% y/y for mobile (vs\n+4% in 4Q), though App minutes were flat, and desktop was up 6% y/y (vs +1% in 4Q).\nThe somewhat weaker mobile minutes trend is notable, particularly the lack of growth in\nEstimates vs Consensus\nOur revenue and EBITDA estimates are slightly above consensus for both 1Q17 and\n2Q17, as well as for 2017 and 2018.

Our $43 price objective is based on 14x 2018E\nEV/EBITDA, slightly above online media comps, which we believe is warranted given the\nhigher margin potential in the model. We believe our multiple balances premium growth\nvs peers with medium-term concerns on competition and limited GAAP profitability. We\nbelieve the slight premium valuation is sustainable if the company can continue to\ndeliver 20%+ y/y topline growth, which would be above the advertising industry.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 47\nZillow (Buy, $42 PO)\nStock view: controversy sounding the mortgage business\nWhile we still expect Zillow’s core business to have a solid quarter on product\nimprovements, the self-serve platform, and its recent Seller Boost product, the\ncontroversy surrounding Zillow’s mortgage business (which potentially has implications\nfor Zillow’s core business and the retail estate industry) has been a key recent driver of\nthe stock. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has indicated that it views\nZillow’s mortgage referral system as potentially violating parts of the Real Estate\nSettlement Procedures Act (RESPA). RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) is\nan act designed to product potential homeowners by outlawing kickback and referral\nfees from real estate services, particularly in relation to mortgage brokers who often\nreceive referrals from real estate agents. Since Zillow’s mortgage referrals involve a\npre-application and a referral directly to a mortgage agent that than a larger entity like a\nbank, this could be violating the act. Mortgage brokers often fund some of the real\nestate agents online advertising expenses and a crackdown on mortgage agents could\npotentially hurt real estate agents ability to spend dollars on Zillow.\nFor now it is too early to say how this will develop as there are conflicting views for and\nagainst this view with the CFPB not releasing an official stance, but we expect this to be\na near term overhang on the stock until a clear view of the CFPB’s view and intentions\nunfold. While a contentious issue, mortgage revenue is still only 8% of total revenue\nand even a cut back would have a minimal impact to overall revenue growth. As for the\nimpact on real estate agent spend on Zillow, we believe at with only roughly 5%\npenetration into real estate agents online spend Zillow has plenty of room to grow the\ncore business and the high ROI of the ad unit will ensure agents buy placements on\nZillow regardless of mortgage broker involvement and continue to like the stock.\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Mortgage requests and revenue per loan\nWith the controversy surrounding the mortgage business, we think investors will be\nextra focused on the mortgage unit and focus on the mortgage revenue per loan request\nand consumer load requests. Zillow will be releasing new metrics this quarter to replace\nARPA and premier agent count, but has yet to indicate what those metrics will be. Key\ntopics for the call will likely include: 1) mortgage business outlook; 2) premier agent\nadvertising spend; 3) rentals business; and 4) progress on FY17 goals.\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n• If the CFPB decides Zillow violates RESPA, Zillow could face fines and have to\nretool its mortgage platform.\n• New metrics for FY17 could give less visibility into the business as a whole.\n• Slower than expected penetration of self-service platform leading to increased\nS&M costs.\n• Potential for a weak 2Q guide if mortgage issues overhang the business as a whole.\nTop 1Q traffic data points: comScore suggests usage up in 1Q\ncomScore desktop data suggests that unique visitors were down 5% quarter to date\n(Jan. and Feb.) while usage was up 2% QTD. However, on mobile, comScore data\nsuggests usage is up 14% y/y on a bigger unique visitor base to 62mn unique users and\nusage was up 7%. We note comScore has made several methodology changes which\nhas impacted the consistency of recent months data.\nEstimates vs. Consensus: We are above the Street\nOver rev/EBITDA estimates of $239mn/$40mn is above the Street at $236mn/$39mn.\nWe estimate that ARPA will be up 29% y/y to $629 and premier agent subscribers will\nbe flat y/y at 91.9K. Overall, we estimate 28% y/y growth, but note that the mortgage\nissues could potentially impact revenue. For rentals and other we estimate $32mn in\nrevenue, up 75% y/y.\n48 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nTable 32: Zillow estimate summary\n1Q17 2Q17 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $239 $261 $1,062 $1,307\nGrowth Y/Y% 25% 23%\nStreet $236 $257 $1,048 $1,258\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. $40 $51 $215 $313\nStreet $39 $46 $211 $298\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nEPS\nBofAML est. $0.06 $0.11 $0.48 $0.89\nStreet $0.05 $0.07 $0.44 $0.80\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nZillow has effectively captured the online U.S. real estate market, allowing them to\naccelerate monetization and access to a large TAM with $87bn in total real estate\ncommissions paid in 2016 and Zillow powering just 5% of the commissions through its\nPremier Agent platform. Although there is potential for the mortgage business to\ncreate a headwind if the CFPB issued a negative ruling against Zillow, we still like the\nstock into the quarter, as we prefer business with minimal competition, and believe that\nthe high ROI of the real estate premium platform to real estate agents will ensure\nagents buy placements on Zillow regardless of mortgage broker involvement. We\nmaintain our $42 PO based on a 6x our 2018E EV/Sales and supported by our DCF\nvaluation. Our multiple is roughly in-line for online real estate lead generation sites in\nother countries operating in developed countries.\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 49\nZynga (Underperform, $2.70)\nStock view: Live events can improve franchises, but still need new titles\nZynga launched Dawn of Titans end of 4Q, and although it progressed into the top 20\ngrossing games in the U.S. Apple store, it has fallen out of the top 100 at some points\nduring the quarter suggesting that its overall revenue contribution has been fairly low.\nWhile this is somewhat disappointing, we think investor expectations for the game are\nnow at reasonable (lower) levels.\nInstead of big new title launches, Zynga has indicated it is focused on strengthening its\ncurrent franchises with better engagement and monetization through live events and\nnew features, and progress in this area is key for the 2017 stock outlook. Zynga Poker\n(up roughly 80% y/y YTD) appears to be benefiting from the focus on engagement and\nlive events with much stronger monetization, which could offset declines in other titles.\nOverall, we think it could be hard to get the Street excited on the stock without a strong\nfuture title that could drive more than single digit growth.\nKey theme/metric(s): DAUs, and live events impact on DAU trends\nAfter launching 10 new games in 2016, Zynga is focusing more heavily on live events to\ndrive engagement with in franchises rather than launching additional titles. This should,\nif successful, translate into better DAU metrics as consumer engage with a title more\noften. With Dawn of Titan likely coming below Street expectations, stronger\nengagement will be necessarily for Zynga to drive a stronger DAU base. For the quarter,\nwe model 17.9mn online game DAUs for 1Q, down slightly q/q, and down 6% y/y.\nBiggest issues/risks:\n• Dawn of Titans revenues: Zynga spend several years developing the game and lack\nof title success could impact sentiment.\n• Expense leverage and cost-cutting benefits do not materialize: Zynga plans to\nfurther improve operational efficiency and potentially cut non-profitable franchises,\nbut this may be hard to do without impacting long term growth opportunities.\n• Lack of new releases: Zynga gave no indication of when it will release its next\ntitle leaving current franchises to carry revenue and earnings.\nTop data points: Zynga game bookings tracking in-line to slightly below est.\nZynga’s largest revenue generating franchises, Zynga Poker was up significantly in 1Q.\nZynga Poker appears to be benefiting from live events and is tracking up roughly 89%\nQTD. Combined slots titles appear a bit more challenged with total revenue down 30%\nQTD y/y, in part due to lower monetization on Wizard of Oz slots which is tracking down\nin gross gaming rankings.

Alphabet has traded at 12-24x forward P/E over the last\nfive years and we think our 17x multiple is reasonable given shareholder friendly actions\nthat include the non-core revenue and operating loss disclosures, and stock buybacks.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) Search revenue growth decelerates faster than\nanticipated due to market maturity, 2) mobile transition drives negative search behavior\nchanges, 3) revenue growth pressure from competitor initiatives, 4) margins disappoint\ndue to revenue mix and investment initiatives, and 5) negative regulatory changes,\nincluding EU antitrust.

Our 5.5x AWS multiple is a modest\npremium to the software/SaaS comp group at 5.0x on 2018 sales, and 0.9x multiple is a\npremium to a retail general merchandise comp group at 0.7x. We think the premiums are\nwarranted given share gains and superior growth. Our $1,100 price objective implies\n2.8x 2018E Price/Sales, a multiple above the high end of Amazon's historical range of\n1.0-2.5x. We argue the historical P/S multiple should increase given positive 3rd party\nsales (3P) that is reported on a net basis, a higher AWS revenue contribution, and record\ngross profit margins.\nDownside risks to our price objective are a consumer spending slowdown, rich P/E\nmultiple, margin or growth pressure from the digitization of media, more aggressive\noffline competition, hardware strategy, AWS investments and/or price cuts, Prime\nInstant Video content costs, and decelerating growth. The stock has been subject to\nheavy volatility in the past, based on margin trends, and this volatility could increase due\nto economic uncertainty.\nBankrate (RATE)\nOur $13 price objective is based on 9x our 2018E EV/EBITDA, a slight discount to the\nonline lead-gen and marketplace peer group average of 11x. We believe it is reasonable\nfor RATE to trade at a slight discount given RATE's recent challenges to both growth\nand margins and its position as a turnaround in the space.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) limited visibility into intra-quarter trends, 2) stock\ndependent on economic outlook, 3) card issuer spending is volatile and the turnaround is\nshort lived, 4) slower growth in personal loans than expected, 5) higher than expected\nmarketing spending to drive traffic to Bankrate sites, resulting in lower margins, 6)\nGoogle changes have a negative impact on marketing margins and EPS, 7) competition\nwith other consumer finance sites, and 8) a large acquisition.\nCare.com (CRCM)\nOur $9 price objective is based on 1.3x 2018E EV/Sales or 10x 2018E EV/EBITDA, in line\nwith small cap ecommerce and subscription peers. Care.com has category leadership\nand a large TAM, but we do not believe 7% 2-yr expected revenue growth warrants a\npremium to peers. At the same time, we believe that the Google Capital investment\ncould provide some downside support on take-out potential.\nDownside risks to our PO are 1) need to add more customers each year to grow given\nhigh churn, 2) competition from SitterCity and Homestead, and 3) new care offerings\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 53\n(mobile apps, premium nanny, date night payment services etc.) may not see much\ntraction, 4) lower conversion rates on mobile, 5) mobile conversions with 30% fee to\nApple and Google Play marketplaces could negatively impact margins, and 6)\ninternational expansion may not be successful given different demographics.\nUpside risks to our PO are 1) lower marketing spend resulting in higher margins and\nbetter leverage in 2016, 2) revenue upside from cross-selling and word of mouth, 3)\nincrease length of stay for paid subscribers, reducing churn, and 4) traction from new\ncare offerings, Care at Work, and international expansion.\neBay (EBAY)\nOur $38 price objective is based on 17x our 2018E EPS. Our 17x P/E multiple is slightly\nahead of the retail comp group average of about 16x, reflecting eBay's potential for a\nMarketplace growth acceleration in 2017.\nRisks to our price objective are: 1) competition from Amazon and other new\nMarketplaces in the U.S., competition from Amazon, Alibaba and local incumbents in\nInternational markets, and competition from multi-channel retailers that are\naggressively investing in the online channel, 2) vulnerability to future Google algorithm\nchanges, 3) decelerating user growth, resulting in eCommerce market share losses, and\n4) currency risk including FX volatility impact on cross border trade. The stock has been\nsubject to heavy volatility in the past based on GMV growth and market share trends\nand this volatility could increase due to economic uncertainty.\nExpedia (EXPE)\nOur $146 price objective is based on our sum of the parts (SOP) that assumes 9x 2018E\nEBITDA for the core OTA business (a discount to Priceline at approx. 15x due to slower\norganic growth and higher taxes on earnings), 8x 2018E EBITDA for Egencia (we expect\nsingle digit growth), 60% ownership of Trivago (using our PO), and HomeAway at 15x\n2018 EV/EBITDA.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) economic downturn leading to fewer travel bookings, 2)\ncompetition for European traffic lowering the company's growth or margin opportunity,\n3) hotels favoring lower-cost alternative distribution channels and limiting Expedia's\naccess to inventory, 4) Google and/or TripAdvisor disintermediation, and 5) the negative\nimpact of terrorism and disease on global travel trends.\nFacebook (FB)\nOur $165 price objective is based on 24x our non-GAAP 2018E EPS and 27x GAAP EPS,\nmultiples equal to about 1x 2018E revenue growth, mostly in-line with its social and\nonline media peers.\nRisks are: 1) high valuation that discounts strong growth, 2) changes in user\nengagement impacts optimism on revenue opportunities and compresses the stock\nmultiple, 3) privacy issues or pushback on Facebook's policy changes impact revenue\ngeneration, 4) risks to executing Messenger & WhatsApp monetization, 5) potential for\nhigher investment to negatively impact margins, and 6) a macroeconomic impact on\nadvertising pricing.\nFitbit (FIT)\nOur $6.50 price objective is based on 0.5x EV/S multiple which is below the device\nmanufacturer peer group at 1.8x, but justified in our view given declining revenue and\nprofitability, FCF burn, market saturation, and limited visibility into the next product cycle.\nUpside risks are: 1) international product launches and expansion, 2) higher-thanexpected\nASPs, 3) new product launches domestically, 4) slower-than-expected OpEx\nramp, 5) software monetization and 6) corporate wellness program growth.\n54 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nDownside risks are: 1) integration risk from smartwatches and other wearables\ncannibalizing the fitness tracker market, 2) fad risk, as fitness trackers could be simply a\nfitness fad with consumers, 3) competitive risk from competitors out-innovating, and 4)\nexecution risk on channel build and inventory management.\nGoPro (GPRO)\nOur $8 price objective is based on 10x our 2018E EBITDA, in line with the peer average\nof 10x, which we believe is appropriate given its slightly higher growth and potential for\nEBITDA margin expansion after restructuring. GoPro is the leading action camera\ncompany in the world but has been challenged by execution issues limiting its ability to\ndrive strong product cycles.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) new products fail to resonate with consumers, 2)\ncompetitive pressure pushing down ASPs, and 3) failure to meet market demand during\nholidays.\nUpside risks to our PO are: 1) better than expected sales on new products, 2) better than\nexpected holiday sales from extra manufacturing capacity, 3) better than expected drone\nsales, or new product announcements, and 4) new direct sales partnerships\ninternationally\nGrubHub (GRUB)\nOur PO is $49, based on 32x our 2018E P/E (vs. high growth internet at 31x). We believe\nGRUB warrants a premium to eCommerce peers due to the attractive margins of the\ncore business and, relative to the overall small-cap sector, GRUB has more attractive\nmargins and growth potential.\nDownside risks to our PO are:\nRevenue and sales metrics are trailing KPIs for Diners and Restaurant and the potential\nfor diminishing returns on future restaurant and user additions is a risk. GrubHub has\nsignificant room for growth in the US ahead, but will need to invest internationally if\ndomestic growth stalls.\nLendingTree (TREE)\nOur $140 price objective represents 14x 2018E EV/EBITDA, a premium to the lead\ngeneration services and marketplace peer group average of 11x due to market position\n(category leader in mortgage and personal loans) and faster revenue growth.\nRisks to achieving our estimates and price objective are: 1) interest rate risks given the\ndemand for leads for mortgage and other loan products, 2) competition with other\nconsumer finance sites and ad networks, 3) potential for search engine\ndisintermediation and traffic competition, 4) potential for recessionary impact on loan\nproducts (lower traffic and demand for leads) and credit card markets, 5) premium\nvaluation vs. lead generation and marketplace peers, and 6) acquisition risk.\nMatch Group (MTCH)\nOur PO is $21 based on 12x our estimated 2018 EBITDA of $562mn and our DCF\nvaluation analysis. The basis for our PO is in-line with the eCommerce group, but a\npremium to the consumer internet subscription services group due to MTCH's\ncombination of market dominance, profitability, and cash flow. We think fundamentals\nhelp MTCH stand out from its ecommerce peer group and MTCH should be seen as a\nmore defensible platform that is unlikely to see disruption in its core markets.\nDownside risks are: market share losses to an emerging dating business, potential for\nhigher acquisition costs on mobile, lower conversion rates that lead to lower PMC\ngrowth, the need to acquire competing sites to maintain growth or market share, and\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 55\nhigher-than-expected International investments. The biggest downside risk is lower\nrevenue if Tinder experiences a decline in popularity or public perception.\nNetflix, Inc. (NFLX)\nOur $154 price objective is based on a peak penetration sum-of-the-parts analysis\nwhich discounts back future EPS at peak penetration by 10%. At peak penetration, we\nassume domestic streams peak at 65mn subscribers in five years while the international\nsegment reaches 200mn seven years later. We assume APRU of $9.99 and 40%\ncontribution margins for the domestic business and a $8.50 APRU and 40% contribution\nmargin for the international business. We also assume a $1.50 price increase\ndomestically over six years and a $3.60 price increase internationally over twelve years\nwhich will be 75% incremental to operating income. We assume a US tax rate of 40%\nand an international tax rate of 25%. At peak penetration, we assume a 15x S&P\naverage multiple.\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing content costs, 2) potential new\ncompetitors in the company's streaming business, 3) execution challenges and\ncompetition potentially limiting growth in new markets, 4) U.S. saturation point\napproaching quicker than expected, and 5) net neutrality repeal causing ISPs to look to\nrecoup higher rents from Netflix's high bandwidth requirements for streaming.\nUpside risks to our price objective are: 1) content costs rising slower than expected, 2)\ntotal subscriber growth is faster than expected, and 3) international expansion into new\nlarge markets (e.g. China).\nOnDeck Capital (ONDK)\nOur $6 price objective is based on 10x our 2018E EBITDA. This is below the internet\necommerce comparable group (11x) which is justified in our view given OnDeck's double\ndigit revenue growth and potential to expand margins starting in 2018 as it gains scale\nand operating leverage, but tempered by a slower FY18.\nUpside risks to our PO are: 1) faster than expected originations growth, 2) signing of\nnew large strategic partners, and 3) lower than expected operating expenses.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) higher than expected loss rates from worsening macro\nenvironment, 2) credit market freeze shutting down liquidity access, 3) lower effective\nyield from competition, and 4) increased marketing spend.\nPandora Media, Inc. (P)\nOur $9 price objective is based on 1x our 2018 revenue estimate, a significant discount\nto online media and subscription service peers, but justified in our view as the multiple\ntakes into account the company's difficult transition to a subscription on-demand\nservice and lack of near term profitability balanced by the value of its data and user\nbase.\nUpside risks to our PO are: 1) direct licensing agreements for lower royalty rates, 2)\ninternational expansion announcements, 3) ad-load increases in key demos, increasing\nmonetization rates, 4) faster than expected launch of on-demand service, and 5) the\ncompany is acquired.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) emerging competition from both other Internet models\nlike Spotify and Apple Music, as well as large, established radio companies like\niHeartMedia embracing Internet streaming, 2) slow down in the company's ability to\ngrow monetization, 3) lack of historical or near-term GAAP profitability, and 4) delayed\non-demand service launch\n56 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\npriceline.com (PCLN)\nOur price objective is $1,920 based on 22x our 2018 adj. EPS estimate. The 22x\nmultiple is towards the upper end of Priceline's historical multiple range of 13-23x and\nrepresents a PEG of 1.4x. We think a 22x forward P/E multiple is appropriate given midteens\nEPS growth, strong booking trends, Priceline's leadership position in the global\nonline travel sector, track record of EPS upside, and increased access to the China\nmarket via the Ctrip investment.\nRisks to our PO are 1) a global economic downturn, especially macro-weakness in\nEurope, leading to fewer travel bookings and pressure on room rates, 2) competition for\ntraffic lowering the company's growth or margin opportunity, 3) hotels favoring their\nown distribution channels, 4) FX volatility, 5) increased competition from Expedia,\nTripAdvisor and potentially Google, and 6) the impact of terrorism/disease on global\ntravel trends. The stock has been subject to heavy volatility in the past based on travel\nindustry trends and this volatility could increase due to greater economic uncertainty,\nespecially with macro-trends in Europe.\nQuotient Technology Inc (QUOT)\nOur $13 price objective is based on a 16x 2018E EBITDA, a premium to eCommerce\npeers (11x), which we think is justified given stickiness of the Retailer IQ platform and\nthe slightly higher growth of 14% in FY17 vs. eCommerce group at 11%). Quotient is a\nlead operator in online couponing, has a strong technological platform, relationships\nwith CPGs and a platform that is slowly spreading across grocers in the U.S.\nDownside risks are: 1) further delays in point-of-sale system rollout with retailers, 2)\nloss of major retailers or CPG, 3) higher-than-expected R&D and S&M costs due to\ninvestment, and 4) limited float may contribute to volatility.\nUpside risks to our analysis are: 1) additional retailers launching on their point-of-sale\nsystem, 2) quicker-than-expected transition to digital couponing, 3) new additional\ndigital coupon retail clients (such as Walmart). and 4) targeted couponing lifting average\ntransaction pricing.\nSnap (SNAP)\nOur $25 PO is based on our DCF model as we do not expect the company to be\nprofitable until mid- to late-2019 and any earnings-based valuation exercise would\nrequire discounting back future earnings. Our DCF assumes approximately $28bn\nrevenue by 2027 based on 525mn DAUs and $50+ in ARPU. Our PO implies 15.5x EV /\nRevenue, above the peer group at 4x, as we believe Snap's early stage of ad\nmonetization and potential future leverage in the business model warrants a premium\nvaluation multiple to the social media group.\nUpside risks to our PO are: 1) greater than expected reacceleration in North America\nDAU growth, 2) more rapid monetization of existing user base with increased ad load\nand/or new ad formats, and 3) better traction and monetization in International markets.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) further deceleration in user growth that would raise\nconcerns on long-term revenue opportunity, 2) pressure on usage due to competing\nservices, and 3) performance into the first lock-up expiration on 7/29/17.\nTripAdvisor (TRIP)\nOur price objective of $40 is based on 25x our 2018 non-GAAP EPS estimate. This\nmultiple represents a modest premium to the group for possibly depressed margins and\nre-accelerating top-line growth.\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing competition (e.g. Yelp), 2) macroeconomic\nfactors (e.g. recession in Europe) impacting the travel industry, 3) challenges\nInternet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 57\nto the credibility of online reviews, 4) Instant Book transition puts pressure on revenue\ngrowth, and 5) mobile monetization headwinds.\nUpside risks to our price objective are: 1) improved mobile monetization 2) major OTA\nsign on for instant booking 3) high non-hotel shopper dollar capture and 4) improved\nglobal macro environment.\nTrivago NV (TRVG)\nOur PO of $15 is based on a 3.5x 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We note that 3.5x is roughly\nin line with the lead generation peer group average 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We think\nour EV/Sales multiple is warranted as a balance between Trivago's higher growth and\nlower profitability. Our price objective is supported by our DCF analysis.\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) Growing competition, 2) Elevated marketing\nspend, 3) High Customer concentration, 4) Macro and FX risks, and 5) Potential for loss\nof hotel inventory.\nTwitter (TWTR)\nOur $14.5 price objective is based on 12x our 2018 EBITDA estimate, which reflects a\ndiscount to the online media group (13x). We believe the Twitter platform has slowing\nuser and revenue growth and as such, we expect the stock to trade at a sustained\ndiscount to online media peers, with potential M&A adding some offsetting downside\nsupport.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) decelerating user growth that may raise concerns on\nlong-term revenue opportunity, 2) pressure on usage due to emergence of competing\nservices, 3) new ad initiatives may not perform well, resulting in lower advertiser\ndemand for Twitter ads, 4) monetization of logged-out users and third party application\nusers are slow to materialize, and 5) on a EV/EBITDA basis Twitter is more attractive\ntoday than in the past, but stock remains subject to multiple compression.\nUpside risks to our PO are: 1) User adds could ramp on new product initiatives in the 2H,\nand accelerating user growth may increase optimism on long-term revenue opportunity,\n2) with new demographic targeting initiatives, Twitter is able to capture more TV dollars\n(vs online ad dollars) that are incremental with video ads, 3) the NFL broadcasts and\nother video content (live political, entertainment, etc.) could help Twitter grow users\nmeaningfully in the long term, 4) guidance could prove to be conservative, 5) traction\nfrom monetization of logged-out users and 6) potential that Twitter could be acquired.\nWayfair (W)\nOur price objective of $44 is based on 0.7x 2018E EV/sales. We continue to focus on\nEV/Sales given Wayfair's lack of profitability to date. Our 0.7x target multiple is a\ndiscount to W's eCommerce comp group and at a modest discount to W's retail comp\ngroup. We think the multiple is appropriate given stronger revenue growth vs. peers,\nbalanced by lower profitability and competitive risks.\nDownside risks are: 1) GAAP operating losses expected through 2018, making valuation\nanalysis more complex, 2) competition from several well capitalized companies including\nAmazon, 3) brand complexity (5 brands), 4) category limitations, 5) partner segment\nrevenue headwinds, and 6) execution risk on International expansion.\nYahoo! (YHOO)\nOur price objective of $57 is based on our sum-of-parts valuation assumptions. Our $53\nestimated asset value represents $39/share from the remaining Alibaba stake (using\n$122 Alibaba valuation {10% discount rate, mid-term FCF FY18-25E CAGR of 18%, 4%\nterminal growth} x 384mn shares at 20% discount rate), $6.1 for Yahoo Japan, $0.5 for\nExcalibur patents, and $6.9 in cash and cash equivalents on Yahoo's balance sheet. We\n58 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017\nassume $4.7/share in value for the core business based Verizon's pending acquisition\nvalue of $4.83bn less $300mn for potential revisions.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) Alibaba stock valuation declines, 2) Alibaba valuation\ndiscount is higher than expected, 3) Verizon's pending acquisition of Yahoo core assets\nis delayed/challenged, 4) valuation of Yahoo! Japan falls, and 5) valuation of Excalibur\npatent portfolio falls.\nYelp (YELP)\nOur $43 price objective is based on 14x 2018E EV/EBITDA, slightly above online media\ncomps, which we believe is warranted given the higher margin potential in the model.\nWe believe our multiple balances premium growth vs peers with medium-term concerns\non competition and limited GAAP profitability. We believe the slight premium valuation\nis sustainable if the company can continue to deliver 25% y/y topline growth with y/y\nmargin improvement.\nDownside risks are Google and Facebook's ambitions to build a review ecosystem to tap\ninto local ad spending, competition from a variety of online and offline locally focused\nadvertising businesses, Google traffic dependency, and advertiser churn.\nZillow (ZG / Z)\nOur $42 price objective is based on a 6x our 2018E EV/Sales and supported by our DCF\nvaluation. Our multiple is roughly in-line for online real estate lead generation sites in\nother countries operating in developed countries. In addition, this multiple represents a\nrelative discount given Zillow's higher sales growth and a larger US TAM in comparison\nto its peers in smaller developed markets like Australia and Japan. We are positive on\nZillow's long term opportunity to capture the majority of realtor's dollars moving from\noffline channels to online marketing channels.\nDownside risks are: 1) traffic cannibalization between Zillow properties, 2) new lawsuits\nagain Zillow, 3) potential for multiple compression, 4) a U.S. housing market down turn,\nand 5) lack of profitability support for valuation.\nUpside risks are: 1) faster than expected growth and S&M leverage, 2) Zillow Digg\nmonetization, 3) accelerated grow the in rentals market, and 4) new market expansion.\nZYNGA (ZNGA)\nOur $2.70 PO is now based on 11x 2018E EBITDA (which is a premium to the Mobile\ngaming peer group due to margin expansion potential), plus $1.41/share in cash and\nassets (building).\nDownside risks to our price objective are mobile market share losses, challenges in\nestablishing successful new content given employee departures, and player churn due to\ngreater competition given low barriers to entry. Upside risks are successful new title\nreleases that accelerate growth, or potential acquisition of Zynga for its game portfolio.\nAnalyst Certification\nWe, Justin Post, Jason Mitchell and Nat Schindler, hereby certify that the views each of\nus has expressed in this research report accurately reflect each of our respective\npersonal views about the subject securities and issuers.

A\nstock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend.
