  "text": "(4.5) shows something about “balance” or the state where capital, consumption and\noutput grow at the same rate. It confirms the standard teaching that balance is\npossible, although not compelled, when growth rate is constant. It also shows that\nbalance is impossible when growth rate changes. No one disputes that capital\nproductivity (output/capital) always leads, and consumption rate\n(consumption/capital) always lags, in accelerations up and down. Output gets the\nbad news first and the good news first. What the equations leave unspecified is\nwhere capital itself joins the sequence. That is what the evidence in the charts and\n\ntables tells us.\n\nIn the case where the free growth index equals one, for example, the above\n\nequations show\n\nthrift gain\n\nthrift index = —=0, implying\nacceleration\n— change in consumption rate\nthrift gain = change in growth rate =0, and\n\nchange in consumption rate =0, or equivalently\n\nconsumption\nconsumption rate = oo = constant, (4.7)\ncapita\n\nif acceleration is non-zero. (The reason for that qualifier is that zero acceleration\n\nmeans zero change in growth rate, and division by zero is a no-no.)\n\nIn the opposite case where the thrift index is one, the same equations would show\n\nfree exerts idles = productivity gain _ changeinproductivtyrate _\nacceleration change in growth rate\n\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 14\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011005",
