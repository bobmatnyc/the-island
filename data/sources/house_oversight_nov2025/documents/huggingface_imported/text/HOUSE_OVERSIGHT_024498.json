  "text": "& Highly educated parents spend more on childcare. The increasing number of college graduates in the\nU.S. and abroad will support continued expenditures on ECE. In 2001, 70% of children with college-\neducated mothers attended childcare programs, while only 38% of children whose mothers had less\nthan a high school degree attended childcare programs. A recent report by the U.S. Department of\nCommerce reveals that families with college degrees spent an average of $92.67 per week (per child)\non childcare in 2000, whereas parents without a high school degree only spent an average of $59.70\nper week per child.\n\nmM increasing demand for Employer-Sponsored Centers. With increased levels of employment,\ncorporations are witnessing growing demand for ECE services. Companies benefit from offering\n\nchildcare services to their employees as (i) it often reduces employee absenteeism; (ii) serves as a\nperquisite, which differentiates the employer's compensation package; and (iii) tends to Jower turnover\nrates. ECE services contribute to a stable and consistent workforce.\n\nH Favorable tax incentives. Certain tax incentives are available to parents utilizing childcare programs.\nSpecifically, Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a federal income tax credit (Child and\nDependent Care Credit) ranging from 20% to 35% {increased in 2003) of certain childcare expenses\nfor “qualifying individuals.” The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 created a\nFederal Employer Tax Credit for certain childcare expenses beginning in 2002. Employers can\nreceive a credit of 25% of their spending on the construction or rehabilitation of a child care facility or\non contracts with a third party child care facility to provide child care services to employees.\nCorporations also benefit from tax incentives of up to $150,000 per year.\n\n8.3.2 Industry Characteristics\n\nThe ECE sector has a number of favorable operating characteristics. First, well-run school operators\nenjoy high returns on capital, predictable revenue streams and strong free cash flows, with students\ngenerally paying in advance of services delivered. Second, industry data shows that tuition rates have\nincreased by approximately 7%, a rate which has exceeded inflation.” The current outlook suggests no\nchange in this dynamic. Third, government regulation and licensing standards represent notable barriers\nto entry.\n\nGiven that education is a universally accepted product, management believes that our business model is\nhighly scalable. The basic center model is expected to be essentially repeatable and transferable to new\nmarkets and locations. With labor representing approximately 50% of the ictal operating cost structure,\ncompanies within this sector tend to benefit from a variable cost structure, which allows them to reduce\ncosts as economic and market conditions change.\n\nOften the demanding requirements for the selection of school directors and teachers can limit the pool of\nqualified employees for the industry. Low pay also tends to result in high turnover rates of approximately\n50% annually within the industry.\n\n8.3.3. Competitive Landscape: Early Childhood Education\n\nThe ECE sector is highly fragmented with the top six previders representing approximately 5% of all\norganized ECE centers. The Company’s primary competitors are (i) local nursery schools and child care\ncenters, some of which are non-profit (including religious-affiliated centers), (ii) providers of services that\noperate out of their homes and (ill) other for-profit companies which may operate a number of centers,\nLocal nursery schools and ECE centers generally charge less for their services. Many religious-affiliated\nand other non-profit child care centers have no or lower rental costs than for-profit chains, may receive\ndonations or other funding to cover operating expenses and may utilize volunteers for staffing.\nConsequently, tuition rates at these centers are commonly tower than the Company’s rates.\n\n*8 Source: Harris Nesbitt Research, Education and Training, September 2005.\n®?
