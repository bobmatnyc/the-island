  "text": "ensure that foreign migrant workers are provided protection equal to nationals of the foreign\ncountry.” This provision does not differentiate between legal and non-legal migrant workers, nor\ndoes it distinguish between forced labor and non-coerced mi grant labor. DOJ believes that any\ninternational standard that we promote must mirror our domestic standards. Similarly, the new\nsubsection (a)(i)(4) could be read as encouraging countries to loosen their immigration laws,\n‘something that the United States Government might not be willing to do.\n\nSubsection (b) amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. § 2151 ef seq) to\nprovide specific assistance for anti-trafficking investigation and prosecution units in foreign\ncountries. This subsection could be construed as prioritizing sex trafficking over labor\ntrafficking. As stated above, DOJ believes that any international standard that we promote musi\nmitror our domestic standards, which prioritize both sex trafficking and labor trafficking.\nFurther, the amendment to 22 U.S.C. § 2152(d)(a)(2) should include a reference to labor\ntrafficking and should, therefore, read “including investigation of individuals and entities that\nmay be involved in trafficking in persons involving sexual exploitation or forced labor.”\n\n3. Section 104\n\nThe Department objects to the language in this section that specifies the groups with\nwhich the United States Government must consult and coordinate in offering assistance and\nprotection to victims of human trafficking. Such language both places undue restrictions on the\nUnited States Government and could limit the Government’s ability to deal with some necessary\ngroups. It has been the consistent practice of the Department to consult widely with a range of\nstake holders and others before designing a program of foreign assistance on human trafficking,\nSuch an additional requirement in the statutory language is unnecessary. We suggest that the\nlanguage be amended to read, “[i]n cooperation and coordination with organizations which may\ninclude the [UNHCR], the International Organization [for] Migration, and other relevant\norganizations....”\n\n4, Section 105\n\nDOJ recommends that subsection (a) also require that the effectiveness of assistance\nprograms be measured based on best efforts to facilitate cooperation with law enforcement, along\nwith the other criteria.\n\n5, Section 106\n\nDOJ opposes the bar in subsection (b)(1) against including cases in which probation or\nlow sentences are given. Some of the most important cases are the ones against cooperating\ndefendants that result in minimal sentences in exchange for information or testimony. Embassies\nShould have the discretion to take such situations into account when evaluating foreign\ngovernment efforts to combat trafficking. The Department recommends amending section\n(b)(1)(B) by striking “shall not be considered to be an” and inserting in its place “shall be\nconsidered on a case by case basis to determine if it will be considered an” so that it will give the tL\nSecretary of State greater flexibility in evaluating the efforts of other countries. 7\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012373",
