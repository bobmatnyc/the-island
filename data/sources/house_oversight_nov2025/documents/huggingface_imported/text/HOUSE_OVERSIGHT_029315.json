Epstein \nOur File No.: 291874 \nDear Mr. Capp: \nDespite the total absence of competent evidence to demonstrate that Bradley Edwards \nparticipated in any fraud against Jeffrey Epstein, and in the face of uncontrovertible \nevidence demonstrating the propriety of every aspect of Edwards' involvement in the \nprosecution of legitimate claims against Epstein, Epstein sued Bradley Edwards. \nEpstein sexually abused three clients of Edwards — L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe — and \nEdwards properly and successfully represented them in a civil action against Epstein. \nNothing in Edwards's capable and competent representation of his clients provided \nany basis for a civil lawsuit against him, but the facts did not deter Epstein from \nengaging in what was a blatant effort to extort Bradley Edwards, utilizing the nearly \nlimitless resources of a vengeful opponent. The extortion failed but the vengeful \nassault by Epstein continues. \nEpstein's action against Edwards essentially alleged that Epstein was damaged by \nEdwards, acting in concert with Scott Rothstein (President of the Rothstein Rosenfeldt \nAdler law firm (\"RRA\") where Edwards worked for a short period of time). Epstein \nalleged that Edwards joined Rothstein in the abusive prosecution of sexual assault \ncases against Epstein to \"pump\" the cases to Ponzi scheme investors. As described by \nEpstein, investor victims were told by Rothstein that three minor girls who were \nsexually assaulted by Epstein: LM., E.W., and Jane Doe were to be paid up-front \nmoney to prevent those girls from settling their civil cases against Epstein. In \nEpstein's view, these child sexual assault cases had \"minimal value\" (Complaint & \nW1NW.SEARCYLAW.COM \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029315 \nThursday, September 12, 2013 \nPage 2 \n42(h)), and Edwards's refusal to force his clients to accept modest settlement offers \nwas claimed to breach some duty that Edwards owed to Epstein. Interestingly, Epstein \nnever states that he actually made any settlement offers. Even more interestingly, \nEpstein was never able to explain how a scheme to defraud third party investors ever \ncaused any legally cognizable damage to Epstein himself. \nThe supposed \"proof' of the Complaint's allegations against Edwards included \nEdwards's alleged contacts with the media, his attempts to obtain discovery from \nhigh-profile persons with whom Epstein socialized, and use of \"ridiculously \ninflammatory\" language in arguments in court. Remarkably, Epstein filed such \nallegations against Edwards despite the fact that Epstein had sexually abused each of \nEdwards's clients and others while they were minors. Indeed, in discovery Epstein has \nasserted his Fifth Amendment privilege rather than answer questions about the extent \nof the sexual abuse of his many victims. Even more remarkably, after filing his suit \nagainst Edwards, Epstein settled the three cases Edwards handled for an amount that \nEpstein insisted be kept confidential. Without violating the strict confidentiality terms \nrequired by Epstein, the cases did not settle for the \"minimal value\" that Epstein \nsuggested in his Complaint. \nBecause Epstein elected to hide behind the shield of his right against self incrimination \nto preclude his disclosing any relevant information about the criminal activity at the \ncenter of his claims, he was barred from prosecuting his case against Edwards. Under \nthe well-established \"sword and shield\" doctrine, Epstein could not seek damages \nfrom Edwards while at the same time asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege to block \nrelevant discovery. Here, Epstein tried to do precisely what the \"well settled\" law \nforbids. Specifically, he tried to obtain \"affirmative relief' — i.e., forcing Edwards to \npay money damages — while simultaneously precluding Edwards from obtaining \nlegitimate discovery at the heart of the allegations that form the basis for the relief \nEpstein was seeking. As recounted more fully in the statement of undisputed facts \nfiled in support of Edwards' Motion for Summary Judgment, Epstein has refused to \nanswer such basic questions about his lawsuit as: \n• \"Specifically what are the allegations against you which you contend Mr. \nEdwards ginned up?\" \no \"Well, which of Mr. Edwards' cases do you contend were fabricated?\" \n• \"Is there anything in L.M.'s Complaint that was filed against you in September \nof 2008 which you contend to be false?\" \n• \"I would like to know whether you ever had any physical contact with the \nperson referred to as Jane Doe in that [federal] complaint?\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029316 \nThursday, September 12, 2013 \nPage 3 \n• \"Did you ever have any physical contact with E.W.?\" \n\"What is the actual value that you contend the claim of E.W. against you has?\" \nThe matters addressed in these questions were the central focus of Epstein's claims \nagainst Edwards. Epstein's refusal to answer these and literally every other \nsubstantive question put to him in discovery deprived Edwards of even a basic \nunderstanding of the evidence alleged to support claims against him and substantiated \nEdwards' position that no such evidence ever existed. Epstein's case was doomed to \nfail on the basis of the \"sword and shield\" doctrine alone. But other grounds were \nequally and independently fatal to Epstein's attempt to use the legal system to scare \nEdwards into submission. \nAll of Edwards' conduct in the prosecution of valid claims against Epstein was \nprotected by the absolute bar of the litigation privilege. \nAnd most fundamentally, Epstein's claims against Edwards were not only unsupported \nby but also directly contradicted by all of the record evidence. From the beginning, \nEdwards diligently represented three victims of sexual assaults perpetrated by Epstein. \nEach and every one of Edwards's litigation decisions was grounded in proper \nlitigation judgment about the need to pursue effective discovery against Epstein, \nparticularly in the face of Epstein's stonewalling tactics. Edwards's successful \nrepresentation finally forced Epstein to settle and pay appropriate damages. Effective \nand proper representation of child victims who have been repeatedly sexually \nassaulted cannot form the basis of a separate, \"satellite\" lawsuit, and therefore \nEdwards was entitled to summary judgment on those grounds as well. \nFacing these insurmountable obstacles, on the eve of the scheduled hearing on \nEdwards' Motion for Summary Judgment, Epstein dismissed all of his claims against \nEdwards. \nPut simply, Epstein made allegations that he knew were baseless, that he never \nintended to try to support, and that were precluded as a matter of well-established law. \nHis lawsuit was merely a desperate measure by a serial pedophile to prevent being \nheld accountable for repeatedly sexually abusing minor females. Epstein's ulterior \nmotives in filing and prosecuting his lawsuit are blatantly obvious. Epstein's behavior \nis another clear demonstration that he feels he lives above the law and that because of \nhis wealth he can manipulate the system and pay for lawyers to do his dirty work - \neven to the extent of having them assert baseless claims against other members of the \nFlorida Bar. Epstein's Complaint against Edwards was nothing short of a far-fetched, \nfictional fairy-tale with absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support his preposterous \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029317 \nThursday, September 12, 2013 \nPage 4 \nclaims. It was his last ditch effort to escape the public disclosure by Edwards and his \nclients of the nature, extent, and sordid details of Epstein's life as a serial child \nmolester. \nThe bulk of Epstein's claims against Edwards hinge on the premise that Edwards was \ninvolved in a Ponzi scheme run by Scott Rothstein. Broad allegations of wrongdoing \non the part of Edwards were scattered willy-nilly throughout the complaint. None of \nthe allegations provided any substance as to how Edwards actually assisted the Ponzi \nscheme, and allegations that he \"knew or should have known\" of its existence all \nfailed for one straightforward reason: Edwards was simply not involved in any Ponzi \nscheme. He provided sworn testimony and an affidavit in support of that assertion, \nand there was not (and could never be) any contrary evidence. \nEdwards was deposed at length in this case. As his deposition makes crystal clear, he \nhad no knowledge of any fraudulent activity in which Scott Rothstein may have been \ninvolved. See, e.g., Edwards Depo. at 301-02 (Q: \" . . . [W]ere you aware that Scott \nRothstein was trying to market Epstein cases . . . ?\" A: \"No.\"). \nEdwards supplemented his deposition answers with an extremely detailed Affidavit \nthat declared in no uncertain terms his lack of involvement in any fraud perpetrated by \nRothstein. In view of this clear evidence rebutting all allegations against him, Epstein \nwas required to \"produce counter-evidence establishing a genuine issue of material \nfact.\" Epstein could not meet this obligation. Indeed, when asked at his deposition \nwhether he had any evidence of Edwards's involvement, Epstein declined to answer, \npurportedly on attorney-client privilege grounds: \nQ. I want to know whether you have any knowledge of evidence that \nBradley Edwards personally ever participated in devising a plan \nthrough which were sold purported confidential assignments of a \nstructured payout settlement? . . . \nA. I'd like to answer that question by saying that the newspapers have \nreported that his firm was engaged in fraudulent structured settlements \nin order to fleece unsuspecting Florida investors. With respect to my \npersonal knowledge, I'm unfortunately going to, today, but I look \nforward to at some point being able to disclose it, today I'm going to \nhave to assert the attorney/client privilege. \nEpstein alleged that Edwards somehow improperly enhanced the value of the three \ncivil cases he had filed against Epstein. Edwards represented three young women — \nL.M., E.W., and Jane Doe — by filing civil suits against Epstein for his sexual abuse of \nthem while they were minors. Epstein purported to find a cause of action for this by \nalleging that Edwards somehow was involved in \"pumping' these three cases to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029318 \nThursday, September 12, 2013 \nPage 5 \ninvestors.\" Edwards could not have possibly \"pumped\" the cases to investors when he \nnever participated in any communication with investors. However, Epstein's \n\"pumping\" claims fail for an even more basic reason: Edwards was entitled — indeed \nethically obligated as an attorney — to secure the maximum recovery for his clients \nduring the course of his legal representation. As is well known, lals an advocate, a \nlawyer zealously asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system.\" \nFla. Rules of Prof. Conduct, Preamble. Edwards therefore was required to pursue \n(unless otherwise instructed by his clients) a maximum recovery against Epstein. \nEdwards, therefore, could never be liable for doing something that his ethical duties as \nan attorney required. In a further effort to harass Edwards, Epstein also filed a bar \ncomplaint with the Florida Bar against Edwards. The Florida Bar dismissed the \ncomplaint. \nAnother reason that Epstein's claims that Edwards was \"pumping\" cases for investors \nfails is that Edwards filed all three cases almost a year before he was hired by RRA or \neven knew of Scott Rothstein. Epstein makes allegations that the complaints \ncontained sensational allegations for the purposes of luring investors; however, \nlanguage in the complaints remained virtually unchanged from the first filing in 2008 \nand overwhelming evidence supports the conclusion that all of the facts alleged by \nEdwards in the complaints were true. \nEpstein ultimately paid to settle all three of the cases Edwards filed against him for \nmore money than he paid to settle any of the other claims against him. At Epstein's \nrequest, the terms of the settlement were kept confidential. Epstein chose to make this \npayment as the result of a federal court ordered mediation process, which he himself \nsought (over the objection of Jane Doe, Edwards' client in federal court) in an effort to \nresolve the case. Notably, Epstein sought this settlement conference — and ultimately \nmade his payments as a result of that conference - in July 2010, more than seven \nmonths after he filed this lawsuit against Edwards. Accordingly, Epstein could not \nhave been the victim of any scheme to \"pump\" the cases against him, because he \nnever paid to settle the cases until well after Edwards had left RRA, after Edwards had \nsevered all connection with Scott Rothstein (December 2009), and well after the \ndetails of Rothstein's Ponzi scheme had been widely publicized. \nIn addition, if Epstein had thought that there was some improper coercion involved in, \nfor example, Jane Doe's case, his remedy was to raise the matter before Federal \nDistrict Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra who was presiding over the matter. Far from \nraising any such claim, Epstein simply chose to settle that case. He was therefore \nbarred by the doctrine of res judicata from somehow re-litigating what happened in \n(for example) the Jane Doe case. The doctrine of res judicata makes a judgment on \nthe merits conclusive 'not only as to every matter which was offered and received to \nsustain or defeat the claim, but as to every other matter which might with propriety \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029319 \nThursday, September 12, 2013 \nPage 6 \nhave been litigated and determined in that action. Obviously, any question of \nimproper \"pumping\" of a particular case could have been resolved in that very case \nrather than re-litigated in satellite litigation. \nEpstein also alleged that Edwards improperly pursued discovery from some of \nEpstein's close friends. Such discovery, Epstein claimed, was improper because \nEdwards knew that these individuals lacked any discoverable information about the \nsexual assault cases against Epstein. Each of the friends of Epstein were and are \nreasonably believed to possess discoverable information. The undisputed facts show \nthe following with regard to each of the persons identified in Epstein's complaint of \nimproper targets of discovery: \n• With regard to Donald Trump, Edwards had sound legal basis for believing \nMr. Trump had relevant and discoverable information. See Statement of \nUndisputed Facts filed in support of Edwards' Motion for Summary Judgment. \nWith regard to Alan Dershovvitz (Harvard Law Professor), Edwards had sound \nlegal basis for believing Mr. Dershowitz had relevant and discoverable \ninformation. See Statement of Undisputed Facts. \nWith regard to former President Bill Clinton, Edwards had sound legal basis \nfor believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable \ninformation. See Statement of Undisputed Facts. \n• With regard to former Sony Record executive Tommy Mottola, Edwards was \nnot the attorney that noticed Mr. Mottola's deposition. See Statement of \nUndisputed Facts. \n• With regard to illusionist David Copperfield, Edwards had sound legal basis \nfor believing Mr. Copperfield had relevant and discoverable information. See \nStatement of Undisputed Facts. \n• With regard to former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Edwards had \nsound legal basis for naming Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson \non his witness list. See Statement of Undisputed Facts. \nThe anticipated trial of this lawsuit will require Edwards to testify about the propriety \nof his litigation decisions and to explain the bases for his good faith belief that each of \nthe identified individuals had relevant information regarding Epstein's serial \nmolestations. The rules of discovery themselves provide that a deposition need only \nbe \"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\" Fla. R. \nCiv. P. 1.280(b), and all of the challenged depositions clearly met that standard. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029320 \nThursday, September 12, 2013 \nPage 7 \nMoreover, the discovery that Edwards pursued has to be considered against the \nbackdrop of Epstein's obstructionist tactics. In both this case and all other cases filed \nagainst him, Epstein asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege rather than answer any \nsubstantive questions. Epstein also helped secure attorneys for his household staff \nwho assisted in the process of recruiting the minor girls, and those staff members in \nturn also asserted their Fifth Amendment rights rather than explain what happened \nbehind closed doors in Epstein's mansion in West Palm Beach. It is against this \nbackdrop that Edwards followed up on one of the only remaining lines of inquiry open \nto him: discovery aimed at those of Epstein's friends reasonably believed to have been \nin a position to corroborate the fact that Epstein was sexually abusing young girls. \nIn the context of the sexual assault cases that Edwards had filed against Epstein, any \nact of sexual abuse had undeniable relevance to the case — even acts of abuse Epstein \ncommitted against minor girls other than L.M., E.W., or Jane Doe. Both federal and \nstate evidence rules made acts of child abuse against other girls admissible in the \nplaintiff's case in chief as proof of \"modus operandi\" or \"motive\" or \"common \nscheme or plan.\" The anxiously anticipated trial of this case will present the first full \ndisclosure of the evidence of the extent of Epstein's criminal conduct in explanation of \nthe reason for and the extent of his malice toward Bradley Edwards. \nEpstein's repeated invocations of the Fifth Amendment raise adverse inferences \nagainst him that leave no possibility that a reasonable factfinder could have ever \nreached a verdict in his favor. Instead, a reasonable finder of fact could only find that \nEpstein was a serial molester of children who was being held accountable through \nlegitimate suits brought by Edwards and others on behalf of the minor girls that \nEpstein victimized. \n\"[I]t is well-settled that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences \nagainst parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative \nevidence offered against them.\" Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976); \naccord Vasquez v. State, 777 So.2d 1200, 1203 (Fla. App. 2001). The reason for this \nrule \"is both logical and utilitarian. A party may not trample upon the rights of others \nand then escape the consequences by invoking a constitutional privilege — at least not \nin a civil setting.\" Fraser v. Security and Inv. Corp., 615 So.2d 841, 842 (Fla. 4th Dist. \nCt. App. 1993). And, in the proper circumstances, \"Silence is often evidence of the \nmost persuasive character.\" Fraser v. Security and Inv. Corp., 615 So.2d 841, \n842 (Fla. 4th Dist. Ct. App. 1993) (quoting United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, \n263 U.S. 149, 153-154 (1923) (Brandeis, J.). \nIn the circumstances of this case, a reasonable finder of fact would have \"evidence of \nthe most persuasive character\" from Epstein's repeated refusal to answer questions \npropounded to him. To provide but a few examples, here are questions that Epstein \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029321 \nThursday, September 12, 2013 \nPage 8 \nrefused to answer and the reasonable inference that a reasonable finder of fact would \ndraw: \n• Question not answered: \"Specifically what are the allegations against you \nwhich you contend Mr. Edwards ginned up?\" Reasonable inference: No \nallegations against Epstein were ginned up. \n• Question not answered: \"Well, which of Mr. Edwards' cases do you contend \nwere fabricated?\" Reasonable inference: No cases filed by Edwards against \nEpstein were fabricated. \n• Question not answered: \"Did sexual assaults ever take place on a private \nairplane on which you were a passenger?\" Reasonable inference: Epstein was \non a private airplane while sexual assaults were taking place. \n• Question not answered: \"How many minors have you procured for \nprostitution?\" Reasonable inference: Epstein has procured multiple minors for \nprostitution. \n• Question not answered: \"Is there anything in L.M.'s Complaint that was filed \nagainst you in September of 2008 which you contend to be false?\" Reasonable \ninference: Nothing in L.M.'s complaint filed in September of 2008 was false — \ni.e., as alleged in L.M.'s complaint, Epstein repeatedly sexually assaulted her \nwhile she was a minor and she was entitled to substantial compensatory and \npunitive damages as a result. \n• Question not answered: \"I would like to know whether you ever had any \nphysical contact with the person referred to as Jane Doe in that [federal] \ncomplaint?\" Reasonable inference: Epstein had physical contact with minor \nJane Doe as alleged in her federal complaint. \nQuestion not answered: \"Did you ever have any physical contact with E.W.?\" \nReasonable inference: Epstein had physical contact with minor E.W. as \nalleged in her complaint. \n• Question not answered: \"What is the actual value that you contend the claim \nof E.W. against you has?\" Reasonable inference: E.W.'s claim against \nEpstein had substantial actual value. \nGiven all of the fatal flaws that infected Epstein's claims against Edwards from the \noutset and the overwhelming evidence that the motivation behind the filing of those \nclaims was exclusively extortion and malice, Epstein's only hope of avoiding the full \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029322 \nThursday, September 12, 2013 \nPage 9 \ndramatic exposure of his life of perversion is to attempt to hide behind the erroneous \ninterpretation of the litigation privilege. That effort has been rejected repeatedly by \nthe trial court, and there is no reason to anticipate any change in that well-reasoned \nrejection. In addition, as will be privately explained at mediation, Epstein's day of \npublic reckoning is inevitable. \nCc: Bradley Edwards, Esquire \nJack A.
