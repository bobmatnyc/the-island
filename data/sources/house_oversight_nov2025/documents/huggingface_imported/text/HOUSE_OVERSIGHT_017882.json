  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n817\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\ngoods and services to large portions of\nSaudi Arabia. Jd. 4. In the past ten\nyears he visited the United States three\ntimes for medical reasons. Jd. 15-6.\nPrior to these medical visits, he took a\nshort trip to New York City in 1964. Jd.\n17. He owned no property, held no bank\naccounts, and conducted no business in\nthis country. Jd. 110.\n\nMr. Aljomaih’s estate argues that there\nwere problems with his service. He was\nserved pursuant to Judge Robertson’s\nMarch 25, 2003 approving service by publi-\ncation. Under that order, Plaintiffs pub-\nlished a list of defendants in two publica-\ntions, The International Herald Tribune\nand Al Quds Al Arabia. The notice in The\nInternational Herald Tribune contained\nMr. Aljomaih’s name in English, a lan-\nguage he could not read. 7d. 111. Al\nQuds Al Arabi is published in Arabic, but\nis not circulated in Saudi Arabia and the\nlist did not include Mr. Aljomaih’s name.\nEven if service was proper, however, the\nestate of Mr. Aljomaih claims the Court\ndoes not have personal jurisdiction over it.\n\nPlaintiffs submit that Mr. Aljomaih is\nimplicated by the “Golden Chain.” Plain-\ntiffs’ Opp. at 9. The “Golden Chain” is a\ngroup of documents that was discovered\nby Bosnian authorities searching the of-\nfices of charity Defendant BIF in March\n2002. Plaintiffs claim the “Golden Chain”\ncontains a list of early direct donors to al\nQaeda. Plaintiffs’ Opp. at 9; see also Bi-\nerstein Aff. in Opp. to Al-Husani Motion\nto Dismiss, Ex. 2 (“Golden Chain” docu-\nment). It includes the entry “Al-Jumaih.\nJeddah (8.A.).” Plaintiffs do not dispute\nthat “for more than sixty years [Mr. Aljo-\nmaih] lived in Rihadh,” not Jeddah, Aljo-\nmaih Decl. 13, yet they insist the docu-\nment identifies him as a direct donor to al\nQaeda. Additionally, Plaintiffs claim that\nMy. Aljomaih’s company donated money to\ncharity Defendant IIRO. Plaintiffs assert\n\nthere are sufficient allegations against Mr.\nAljomaih in the form of general allegations\nagainst all Defendants to put him on notice\nof the claims against him. They claim that\njurisdiction over Mr. Aljomaih’s estate is\nproper because he “purposefully directed”\nhis activities at the United States by sup-\nporting al Qaeda. Plaintiffs also submit\nthat Mr. Aljomaih’s company does busi-\nness with General Motors and Shell Corpo-\nration and that, therefore, he must have\nhad contacts with the United States. See\nOpp. at 11; Statement of Jamie L. Paye\nattached to Plaintiffs’ Opp.\n\n[63] The Court finds the Plaintiffs\nhave not established a prima facie case of\njurisdiction over Mr. Aljomaih to defeat\nhis motion or warrant jurisdictional discov-\nery. Their theory of jurisdiction rests al-\nmost entirely on a document with serious\nfoundational flaws. Even assuming, as the\nCourt must, that the “Golden Chain” re-\nfers to Mr. Aljomaih, with no indication of\nwho wrote the list, when it was written, or\nfor what purpose, the Court cannot make\nthe logical leap that the document is a list\nof early al Qaeda supporters. Mr. Aljo-\nmaih’s motion to dismiss the Burnett com-\nplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction is\naccordingly granted.\n\n5. Sheikh Hamad Al—Husani\n\nThe posture of the Burnett Plaintiffs’\ncase against Sheikh Hamad Al-Husani is\nsimilar to that against Mr. Aljomaih. Mr.\nAl-Husani was also added to a list of\ndefendants to be served by publication and\nthe complaint contains no specific allega-\ntions against him. Al-Husani Decl. 1 10.\nHe is a watch retailer residing in Saudi\nArabia. Jd. 19134, 7. Mr. Al-Husani has\nnever visited the United States, owns no\nreal property here, holds no bank accounts\nor investments in the United States, and\ndoes not engage in transactions with any\nbusinesses in the United States.
