Al Baraka allegedly\nprovided financial infrastructures in Sudan\nto Osama bin Laden through Defendant\ncharity Al Haramain. Ashton Complaint\n119 584, 585, 598; Burnett Complaint 11 48,\n49, 62,\n\nPlaintiffs do not offer any factual allega-\ntions against Al Baraka or Mr. Kamel to\nwithstand their motions to dismiss. The\nmajority of the complaints’ allegations re-\ngarding Al Baraka actually concern Dallah\nAlbaraka. The specific allegations against\nAl Baraka are that through Al Haramain it\nprovided financial infrastructures in Su-\ndan, it provided support to Al Haramain,\nand it is present in the Sudan banking\nbusiness through banks it holds. The\ncomplaints do not allege that Al Baraka\nknew or had any reason to know that Al\nHaramain was supporting terrorism, nor\ndo they allege facts from which such an\ninference could be drawn.\n\nThe allegation that an employee of a\nDallah Albaraka subsidiary financially sup-\nported two of the hijackers in San Diego\ndoes not translate into an allegation that\nMr. Kamel provided material support to\nterrorism or aided and abetted those that\nprovided material support. An employee’s\nactions cannot be a basis for employer\nliability unless the employee was acting in\nfurtherance of the employer’s business.\nTasso, 1997 WL 16066, at *6. There is no\nallegation that Mr. Kamel knew Mr. al\nBayoumi or directed anyone at the Della\nAlbaraka subsidiary to support al Qaeda or\nthe hijackers. Similarly, the allegation\nthat Mr. Kamel was one of three founders\nof Al Shamal Islamic Bank in 1983, without\nadditional allegations, does not state a\nclaim for relief. Thus, the Ashton and\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nBurnett claims against Al Baraka and Mr.\nKamel are dismissed in their entirety.\n\n5. NCB\n\n[99] The Ashton and Burnett Plain-\ntiffs’ allegations against NCB are outlined\nin Part I.B.4. The Court finds it would be\npremature to analyze Plaintiffs’ largely\nconclusory claims against NCB under Rule\n12(6)(6) at this time. NCB may be im-\nmune from suit and further discovery if it\nis found to be an instrumentality of the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and its actions\ndo not fit within the FSIA’s exceptions to\nimmunity. Additionally, the Court is not\nyet convinced that it would be proper to\nexercise personal jurisdiction over NCB.\nAccordingly, NCB’s motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim is denied without\nprejudice. NCB may renew its motion\nupon completion of the limited jurisdiction-\nal discovery—tirst with respect to its in-\nstrumentality status—outlined by the\nCourt above.\n\n6. Saudi Binladin Group\n\n[100] The Ashton and Burnett allega-\ntions against the SBG are outlined in Part\nII.C.8. The same allegations that warrant\nlimited jurisdictional discovery to investi-\ngate whether SBG purposefully directed\nits activities at the United States and its\ncontacts with the United States preclude\ndismissal under 12(b)(6) at this time. SBG\nprovided construction support to Osama\nbin Laden. Ashton Complaint 11550,\n552-53; Burnett Complaint 11319-22. A\nbranch of SBG purportedly provided shel-\nter to an al Qaeda operative. Ashton\nComplaint 1555; Burnett Complaint 1 324.\nSBG has, at some point, had a close rela-\ntionship with Osama bin Laden, but the\ncomplaints do not specify when or whether\nthe relationship continues. While these\nallegations are certainly not sufficient to\nreach a jury, if Plaintiffs demonstrate that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017901",
