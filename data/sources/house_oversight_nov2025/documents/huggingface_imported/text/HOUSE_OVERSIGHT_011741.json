  "text": "I was not just angry, but frustrated at my inability to rebut the story in\nperson. Doron and I immediately made arrangements to return to Israel early,\nwhich, since there was no direct air connection, meant finding the first flight out\nthrough London. But before we left, Nava phoned again, almost sputtering in\nfury. She told me that she’d just received a call from Aliza Goren, Rabin’s\nmedia spokesperson. “Does Ehud know about the Yediot story?” she’d asked.\nWhen Nava said yes, Aliza told her: “It is important that Ehud knows that we\nare not going to get involved in getting him out of this.”\n\nWelcome to politics, 1 thought. Rabin knew that the story was untrue. I’d still\nbeen in Tze’elim when I’d phoned him about what had happened. He knew I’d\nremained there to order in the medical helicopters and arrange for the\nevacuation of the wounded before returning to brief him. Still, he did not say a\nsingle word in public — nor, for that matter, speak to me — as the controversy\ncontinued to gather force.\n\nDuring our stopover in London, I sat with Doron and talked through how to\nget my voice heard. I telephoned Yoni Koren, the officer who’d been my top\naide in the kirva and whom I'd asked to work for me in the Interior Ministry,\nassuming I now actually got there. I told him to phone Amnon Lipkin and say\nthat I had expected him to answer the fabrications. Not only had he and I been\nat the site of tragedy together. We'd /eft together, on the same helicopter.\nAmnon did now issue a statement saying that he knew Yediot’s allegations were\nwrong. But the story had been allowed to stand for too long. His rebuttal caused\nbarely a ripple.\n\nAs I read the latest Israeli newspapers before landing in Tel Aviv, I found\nthat at least I wasn’t totally on my own. Reporters had been phoning politicians\nfor comment. Most responded like weathervanes, going with the prevailing\nwind, which was gusting against me. But three Knesset members dissented. One\nwas Ori Or, a friend even before we’d both gone into the army, and who had\nnow joined Labor. The other two were leading members of Likud: Dan Meridor\nand Benny Begin, Menachem Begin’s son. All three said they were sure the\nallegations were false. Did they know the details about the accident, they were\nasked. No, they replied, they didn’t need to. They knew me.\n\nNow all I had to do was convince the rest of the country. It had been nearly a\nweek since the Yediot’s “exposé”. It was Yoni Koren who passed on a request\nfrom Channel | television, our equivalent of the BBC. They were proposing that\nI appear with Nissim Mishal, the man who had interviewed me 10 years earlier,\n\nat the urging of Rabin’s political aide, on my first TV appearance. For Mishal,\n\n270\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011741",
