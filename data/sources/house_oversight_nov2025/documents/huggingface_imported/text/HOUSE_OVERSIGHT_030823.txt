Subject: Little Hodiaki

The teacher said, "Let's begin by reviewing some American History.
Who said 'Give me Liberty , or give me Death'?"

She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Little Hodiaki a bright foreign
exchange student from Japan, who had his hand up:'Patrick Henry, 1775'
she said.."Very good!"

Who said, 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall
not perish from the Earth?"

Again, no response except from Little Hodiaki, ‘Abraham Lincoln, 1863"'..

"Excellent!', said the teacher continuing, ‘let's try one a bit More difficult...’

Who said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country?'
Once again, Hodiaki's was the only hand in the air and he said;'John F. Kennedy, 1961".

The teacher snapped at the class, ‘Class, you should be ashamed of yourselves, Little Hodiaki isn't from this
country and he knows more about our history than you do."

She heard a loud whisper: fuck the Japs,'

"Who said that? I want to know right now!' she angrily demanded.
Little Hodiaki put his hand up, ‘General MacArthur, 1945.’

At that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke."

The teacher glares around and asks, 'All right!!! Now who said that!?'
