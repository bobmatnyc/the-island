  "text": "as I outline above in the Klark example. Or even quicker, as for example with the hand-\nsqueeze system, where the participants agree ahead of time that you can squeeze another\nperson's hand twice and expect two squeezes back -- and if there aren't two return\nsqueezes, it's time to stop and figure out what's going wrong. (Squeeze system: also very\nhelpful when gags are involved.)\n\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\n\nThere are all kinds of safesigns when nonverbal communication is necessary; one being\nto give the bottom an object to hold and to drop when at a limit. It has the disadvantage of\nbeing binary, so it loses the middle step that the stoplight system provides.\n\nClarisse Thorn:\n\nSometimes submissives will have a hard time safewording -- whether out of pride,\ninexperience, or eagerness to please -- and that's another reason check-ins can be good\neven when there's a set safeword. If you aren't sure how to read your partner's reactions\nand you suspect ze may be uncomfortable with what you are doing, then you might\nconsider checking in even if ze hasn't safeworded, because your suspicion may be right.\n\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\n\nThis can't be emphasized enough. Tops Can Never Be On Cruise Control! A safeword\ngives the bottom a tool to communicate, but it does not ensure safety. The top has at least\nas much information that the bottom doesn't have, as the bottom has information the top\ndoesn't have. Therefore, the top has to be a full participant in making sure the scene is\nworking and the risks are under control at all times. Anyone who thinks ze can ignore\nsafety as long as the bottom has a safeword is dangerous.\n\nThis post was edited to add: In the comments on this article, Dw3t-Hthr made a powerful\npoint that for some people, safewords are unavailable in scene. She said, in part:\n\n[I]f I am in a place where a safeword might be necessary, a safeword is not possible. Not\njust because I am someone who is regularly nonverbal, but because the altered\nconsciousness state that I achieve makes processing those sorts of questions at best\ndifficult and at worst unachievable...\n\nBut I'm not a bottom, I'm a submissive, and this isn't about \"wanting to please,” it's about\na psychological incapacity to recognise when I might be doing myself damage in certan\nsituations. If I'm not in that state, I can say \"Oh stop doing that it's wrenching my\nShoulder\" or whatever is appropriate. If I am in that state, I cannot indicate and have to\nplace complete trust in the judgement of my partner.\n\nI happen to know that I'm not the only person like this. I think it's important to recognise\nthat safewords are not always possible. It's important, I think, to communicate to the\nperson who resembles me in this that while their brainwiring is not morally incorrect,\nthat they probably ought to think of themselves as Advanced Subjects and try to do their\nthing in a context where the trust and competence required to do it safely is\ndemonstrated.\n\nAlso, a note on terminology: Clarisse used \"submissive\" there in a way where it's not\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018469",
