  "text": "and-effect explanations of behavior that\ngive a sense of predictability and\ncontrol. A meteorologist may know that\na hurricane may strike here or there\ndepending on environmental conditions.\nLacking such knowledge, a hurricane\nthat strikes here rather than there may\nlead people to invoke a mindful agent—\nsuch as a God—to explain that action.\n\nProjecting. If introspection\nmakes your own mind visible, then you\nmight assume that those who look\nsimilar to you on the outside might look\nsimilar to you on the inside as well.\nIndeed, animals that move at a\nhumanlike speed (such as a horse) seem\nmore mindful to people than do animals\nthat move either much slower (such as a\nsloth) or much faster (such as a\nhummingbird).'' And an agent that look\nhumanlike, such as a computerized\navatar with human face, seems more\nmindful than avatars that do not look\nhumanlike. Any parent knows how well\ntoy makers love to capitalize on this\ntendency. But it is the converse of this\neffect that is even more interesting—\nother minds become less visible as the\nagent becomes less similar to the self.\nOthers that differ from you in their\ninterests, nationality, or social status are\nlikely to be seen as less mindful—less\nthoughtful, less likely to experience\ncomplicated emotions, less able to\nexperience pain or suffering—than those\nthat are similar to you. It is little\nwonder, then, that the history of human\nconflict is filled with instances of people\ndehumanizing radically different others,\ntreating them like mindless animals or\nobjects.’\n\nWhy Minds Matter\n\nIt may not be obvious to you why\nit matters that your neighbor, every now\nand then, thinks that her computer has a\n\nPage |97\n\nmind of it’s own, that a mayor believes\nthat God punished his city by sending a\nhurricane, or that you truly believe that\nyour pet poodle is thoughtful and\nconsiderate. Some of these attributions\nof mind seem purely metaphorical and\ntherefore unimportant, as ways of\nspeaking rather than ways of believing,\nwhereas others seem to represent\ngenuine beliefs about the real presence\nor absence of another social mind. But\nmetaphors have a way of influencing\nbehavior in ways that are consistent with\nbelieving the metaphor to be literally\ntrue. People metaphorically refer to\nfeeling dirty after behaving unethically,\nand yet washing one’s hands actually\nreduces the guilt that people report\nfeeling from engaging in unethical\nactions.'? People are surely just\nspeaking metaphorically when they refer\nto rejection as being given the cold\nshoulder, and yet research demonstrates\nthat people do indeed report feeling that\na room is colder after someone has just\nrejected them than after someone has\njust accepted them.'* And surely people\nare only speaking metaphorically when\nthey refer to the stock market as anxious\nor jittery, and yet describing the market\nas mindful leads stock traders to believe\nthat trends are likely to continue whereas\ndescribing the market as mindless leads\ntraders to predict more random\nvariability.'” Whether metaphorical or\nliteral, seeing other agents as mindful\nmatters because people tend to treat the\nagent as if it has a mind. That matters\nfor at least three major reasons.\n\nFirst, mindful agents have both\nintentions and the capacity for self-\ncontrol. Mindful agents can therefore be\nheld responsible for their actions.\nPossessing a guilty mind (mens rea) is\nnecessary for being held criminally\nresponsible for a crime in the US, a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021343",
