Top aide of Epstein prosecutor in sex case defends former boss

By JULIE K. BROWN
Miami Herald

MIAMI — A former top prosecutor
involved in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case
is defending his old boss, Alexander
Acosta, whose decision to craft a secret
plea deal with the wealthy New York
hedge fund manager has come under
federal scrutiny.

Epstein, who also has homes in Palm
Beach, Fla., and New York, lives on
Little St. James Island off St. Thomas.

In his first public comments on the
10-year-old case, Jeffrey H. Sloman

who at the time was second in com-
mand under Acosta at the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office in Miami — said prosecu-
tors resolved the case based on the facts
and evidence, and what he called “legal
impediments,” including the belief that
many of Epstein’s teenage victims were
too “terrified” to cooperate in the case.

“Given the obstacles we faced in
fashioning a robust federal prosecution,
we decided to negotiate a resolution,”
said Sloman, now in private practice.
“We did not reach this decision lightly
and it came only after significant and
often rancorous internal debate.”

In a lengthy
opinion piece sub-
mitted to the Mi-
ami Herald Edito-
rial Board, Sloman
alleges that scruti-
ny of Acosta’s role
in the controversial
case is being fu-
eled by politically
motivated — critics
who failed to raise
significant issues
with it when Acos-
ta was nominated
and confirmed as
the U.S. secretary
of labor in 2017.

Sloman’ com-
ments come two

weeks after the
Alexander Justice — Depart-
Acosta ment announced

it had opened an
investigation into whether there was
prosecutorial misconduct in the case in-
volving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid
scheme from his Palm Beach estate
that targeted scores of underage girls
from 2001 to 2006.

Jeffrey H. Sloman —
who at the time was
second in command
under Alexander Acosta
at the U.S. Attorney's
Office in Miami — said
prosecutors resolved
the case based on the
facts and evidence, and
what he called “legal
impediments,” including
the belief that many of
Jeffrey Epstein’s
teenage victims were
too “terrified” to
cooperate in the case.

About 30 members of Congress de-
manded the probe following a Miami
Herald series of stories, “Perversion of
Justice,” that detailed how federal pros-

ecutors, led by Acosta, stitched together
an unusual immunity deal that allowed
Epstein to escape what could have been
a life sentence in federal prison.

Instead, Epstein whose friends
included President Donald Trump, Bill
Clinton and other politically connected
people — was allowed to quietly plead
guilty to prostitution charges in state
court. He served 13 months in the
county jail, where he was allowed lib-
eral work release privileges rarely given
to sex offenders in Florida and barred
by the Palm Beach Sheriff's Depart-
ment’s own rules.

He was released in 2009, but his vic-
tims — who were 13 to 16 years old at
the time — are still fighting more than
a decade later to have his non-prosecu-
tion agreement overtumed.

In his op-ed, Sloman called Acosta
“an outstanding public servant ... at
risk of becoming collateral damage in
Washington's latest polarized confla-
gration,” adding, “I won't let it happen
without first being heard.”

“As additional details about Epstein’s
crimes have emerged, it is clear to me
that we should have pushed for much
harsher terms,” Sloman wrote. “That

said, some have mistakenly suggested
that our office kowtowed to Epstein'’s
high-priced defense lawyers or, worse,
that his lawyers corrupted or intimidat-
ed us into submission ... nothing could
be further from the truth.”

Sloman did not directly address the
chief complaint brought by Epstein’s
victims, who are now in their late 20s
and carly 30s. Those who spoke to the
Herald said they felt betrayed by federal
prosecutors, who sealed the non-pros-
ecution agreement from public view
so that they wouldn't find out about it
before he was sentenced. It would be
almost a year before they were success-
ful in having it unsealed. By then, it was
too late to try to derail it.

They allege, ina federal lawsuit filed
against the govemment, that prosecu-
tors deliberately kept the deal secret

in violation of federal law — to pre-
vent them from appearing at Epstein'’s
sentencing to possibly undo the deal.
Nor did Sloman address why prosecu-
tors also gave immunity to a number
of Epstein’s co-conspirators, who have
never been identified.
