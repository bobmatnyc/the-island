  "text": "However, I have had an abortion, and I was totally outraged by the blatant hypocrisy I’d overheard. I had never\n\nleaked a document before, but my anger overshadowed my fear.\n\nI chose Nina Totenberg because I had come to trust her reporting about the Supreme Court on National\nPublic Radio. I honestly had no idea what leaking the affidavit would accomplish. I certainly did not envision\nthat it would literally embarrass the Senate into delaying the vote until public hearings were held, though that\n\nprobably was my secret desire.\n\nBut Judge Thomas testified under oath that he had never discussed the subject of abortion. However, in\nresponse to a question by Senator Hank Brown, Professor Hill testified that she had disagreed with Judge Thomas\n\nin a discussion about Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, then-Senator Joseph Biden quickly interrupted her.\n“That is not the subject of these hearings,” he said.\n\nPersonally, I feel quite disappointed about that particular aspect of the testimony, but I have not the slightest\n\nregret over leaking Anita Hill’s affidavit, and I would gladly do it all over again.\n\nI certainly set a higher moral standard for myself than did the staffer for Senator John Danforth who wrote\n\nJudge Thomas’s statement that began, “Nobody helped me with this.”\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
