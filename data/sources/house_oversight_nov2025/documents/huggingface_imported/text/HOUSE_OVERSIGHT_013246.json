  "text": "330 A Glossary\n\nwithin a deme, programs are generally similar enough that reasonable syntax-semantics\ncorrelation obtains.\n\ne Derived Hypergraph: The SMEPH hypergraph obtained via modeling a system in terms\nof a hypergraph representing its internal states and their relationships. For instance, a\nSMEPH vertex represents a collection of internal states that habitually occur in relation to\nsimilar external situations. A SMEPH edge represents a relationship between two SMEPH\nvertices (e.g. a similarity or inheritance relationship). The terminology \"edge /vertex” is\nused in this context, to distinguish from the “link / node” terminology used in the context\nof the Atomspace.\n\ne DeSTIN — Deep SpatioTemporal Inference Network: A specific CSDLN created by\nItamar Arel, tested on visual perception, and appropriate for integration within CogPrime.\n\ne Dialogue: Linguistic interaction between two or more parties. In a CogPrime context, this\nmay be in English or another natural language, or it may be in Lojban or Psynese.\n\ne Dialogue Control: The process of determining what to say at each juncture in a dialogue.\nThis is distinguished from the linguistic aspects of dialogue, language comprehension and\nlanguage generation. Dialogue control applies to Psynese or Lojban, as well as to human\nnatural language.\n\ne Dimensional Embedding: The process of embedding entities from some non-dimensional\nspace (e.g. the Atomspace) into an n-dimensional Euclidean space. This can be useful in an\nAI context because some sorts of queries (e.g. “find everything similar to X”, “find a path\nbetween X and Y”) are much faster to carry out among points in a Euclidean space, than\namong entities in a space with less geometric structure.\n\ne Distributed Atomspace: An implementation of an Atomspace that spans multiple com-\nputational processes; generally this is done to enable spreading an Atomspace across mul-\ntiple machines.\n\ne Dual Network: A network of mental or informational entities with both a hierarchical\nstructure and a heterarchical structure, and an alignment among the two structures so that\neach one helps with the maintenance of the other. This is hypothesized to be a critical\nemergent structure, that must emerge in a mind (e.g. in an Atomspace) in order for it to\nachieve a reasonable level of human-like general intelligence (and possibly to achieve a high\nlevel of pragmatic general intelligence in any physical environment).\n\ne Efficient Pragmatic General Intelligence: A formal, mathematical definition of general\nintelligence (extending the pragmatic general intelligence), that ultimately boils down to:\nthe ability to achieve complex goals in complex environments using limited computational\nresources (where there is a specifically given weighting function determining which goals\nand environments have highest priority). More specifically, the definition weighted-sums the\nsystem’s normalized goal-achieving ability over (goal, environment pairs), and where the\nweights are given by some assumed measure over (goal, environment pairs), and where the\nnormalization is done via dividing by the (space and time) computational resources used\nfor achieving the goal.\n\ne Elegant Normal Form (ENF): Used in MOSES, this is a way of putting programs in\na normal form while retaining their hierarchical structure. This is critical if one wishes\nto probabilistically model the structure of a collection of programs, which is a meaningful\noperation if the collection of programs is operating within a region of program space where\nsyntax-semantics correlation holds to a reasonable degree. The Reduct library is used to\nplace programs into ENF.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013246",
