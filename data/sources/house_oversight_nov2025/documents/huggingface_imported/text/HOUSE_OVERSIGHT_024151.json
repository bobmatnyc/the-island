  "text": "UK equities\n\nFTSE 100 (27 June): 5,524 (last month: 5,266)\nUBS View FTSE 100 (6-month target): 5,785\n\ne We continue to like UK equities relative to global ones. An expected improvement in the global economy\nover the coming quarters should support UK companies as 70% of revenues are generated abroad.\n\n¢ Energy is the largest sector of the UK market. While the oil price eased sharply over the past months, we\nexpect it to stabilize in the second half of 2012. An attractive valuation of the energy sector at 6.5x trailing\nearnings provides some buffer for earnings volatility going forward.\n\ne Profitability of UK banks is reasonable. They are less affected by the sovereign debt crisis than their\nEurozone peers. While the recent easing of collateral requirements by the Bank of England is supportive in\nthe short-term, the profitability of the domestic operations could be negatively affected by the\nimplementation of the ring-fencing bank reform by 2015.\n\n¢ UK equities’ P/E, at about 10.0x trailing, indicates attractive value relative to global equities. Based on our\n12-month forward earnings growth estimate of about 5% and the P/E multiple slightly expanding to 10.3x,\nwe expect UK equities to show good returns over the next six months.\n\n4 Positive scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 6,650\n\n¢ Continued global growth and strong demand from emerging markets should support demand for\ncommodities, helping the Materials and Energy sectors to lead the market higher. The market could re-rate\nto a P/E multiple of close to 12.0x, and we would expect earnings growth of 5-8% over 12 months.\n\n& Negative scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 4,400\n\ne A global recession drags UK earnings down by 15-20%. The market's defensive characteristics would only\npartly offset its strong exposure to commodity-related sectors. We would expect the trailing P/E multiple to\ndrop towards slightly below 9x.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nGrowth indicators Business survey indicators provide information on the economic development in\nthe UK. Key date: 2 July, PMI manufacturing for June; 4 July, PMI services\nfor June;\n\nCommodity prices Energy and Materials together are about 30% of the UK market by market\n\ncapitalization. Developments in commodity prices affect earnings estimates.\nPolicy action Loose monetary policy by the Bank of England (BoE) supports equities. Key date:\n\n05 July, Bank of England policy meeting\n\nPreference: overweight\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne We like the Energy sector due to\nattractive valuations; Consumer Staples\nis another preferred sector Because of\nits defensive qualities.\n\ne Approaching the end of the patent cliff\nshould remove some uncertainty on the\nHealthcare sector and enable a re-\nrating.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne As commodity-related sectors, Energy\nand Materials should benefit from\nrobust demand in emerging markets.\n\ne The UK market's 4% dividend yield\nprovides a good income stream.\n\nUK market trades at a P/E-discount\n(based on realized earnings)\n\n01.90 01.92 01.94 01.96 01.98 01.00 01.02 01.04 01.06 01.08 01.10 01.12\n—— FTSE 100 realized PIE World realized PIE\n\nSource: Thomsen Reuters, UBS CIO, as of 21 June 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n16\n\nFor further information please contact CIO asset class specialist Markus Irngartinger, markus.irngartinger@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024151",
