The large box at the\ncenter is the Atomspace, the system’s central store of various forms of (long-term and working)\nmemory, which contains a weighted labeled hypergraph whose nodes and links are \"Atoms\" of\nvarious sorts. The hexagonal boxes at the bottom denote various hierarchies devoted to recog-\nnition and generation of patterns: perception, action and linguistic. Intervening between these\nrecognition/generation hierarchies and the Atomspace, we have a pattern mining/imprinting\ncomponent (that recognizes patterns in the hierarchies and passes them to the Atomspace; and\nimprints patterns from the Atomspace on the hierarchies); and also OpenPsi, a special dynam-\nical framework for choosing actions based on motivations. Above the Atomspace we have a\nhost of cognitive processes, which act on the Atomspace, some continually and some only as\ncontext dictates, carrying out various sorts of learning and reasoning (pertinent to various sorts\nof memory) that help the system fulfill its goals and motivations.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013033",
