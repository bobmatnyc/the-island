Like Tavern on the Green,\nCentury Association, Dalton is\n\nK-12 rocket ship built for the\n\n3SeS.\nin, who has no college degree,\n\n‘his teens and already a teacher of\nsid” is the Dalton School's credo.\n; adopted. For him, Dalton’s an\n\nigh School. The kids he’s teach-\nyarents are extremely well con-\ntter-borough accent, he’s careful\nmoment, he’s one parent-teacher\new world of possibilities.\n\nlent student-to-teacher ratio, the\nte well. Before long, a Wall Street\niberg has taken a special shine to\n\nring his son Ted.\n\nme froma humble background.\nity shopkeeper, he won a football ,\nof Oklahoma, transferred to the\n\nFirtuy Ricu\n\nUniversity of Missouri following a back injury, and graduated in\n1949. That same year, he moved to New York and, after a series\nof rejections at white-shoe firms—places that never would hire\na Jew— landed a job at Bear Stearns, earning $32.50 a week as a\nclerk.\n\nBy 1958, he'd been made a full partner. Built like a pit bull,\nGreenberg smoked cigars, performed coin tricks for his friends,\nand always dressed in a bow tie. He was an all-elbows trader—\ngruff, cheap, and, above all, impatient. He was also a champion\nbridge player, a hunter of big game in Africa, and the firm but\nloyal leader of the team he'd built at Bear Stearns—an unusual\nteam made up mostly of men who'd grown up in New York’s\nouter boroughs.\n\nGreenberg didn’t care about MBAs or Ivy League diplomas.\nWhat he cared about was raw talent and drive. Greenberg culti-\nvated risk takers, unconventional thinkers, and he looked high\n(and especially low) for his “PSDs”: men who, in his estimation,\nwere poor, smart, and, above all, determined.\n\nJeffrey Epstein, the Dalton School teacher, fit Greenberg’s bill\nperfectly.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022064",
