His disclosure about the case\nleaves little doubt that Russian officials had engaged Snowden in\nHong Kong, that Putin had authorized his trip to Moscow, and that\nthe Russian government allowed him to fly to Moscow without a\nRussian visa. We know that Putin’s version is supported by U.S. sur-\nveillance of Snowden’s activities in Hong Kong.
