In it, the\ncyber-defense units of the army, navy, marines, and air force cyber\nforces were merged together and put under the command of the\nNSA director. General Keith Alexander became the first director\nof this new command. One problem for the Cyber Command was\nseparating attacks by civilians, including criminals, hacktivists, and\nanarchists, from cyber warfare sponsored and supported by adver-\nsary states. Because foreign intelligence services often closely imi-\ntated the tools of civilian hackers, and were even known to provide\nthem with hacking tools, it was not easy for the Cyber Command\nto unambiguously determine if the ultimate perpetrator of a cyber\nattack was state sponsored. For example, the identification of North\nKorea as the principal actor behind the attack on Sony in December\n2014 appeared to be a rare success, but many cyber-security experts\nbelieved that it might be a false trail used to hide the real attacker.\nClues could be fabricated in cyberspace to point to the wrong party.\n\nThe job of the Cyber Command was to prevent such an attack. To\n\nthis end, it planted viruses on hundreds of thousands of computers\n\n© in private hands to act as sentinels to spot other suspicious viruses ®\nthat could mount such an attack. Private computers had become\na new battleground in the cyber wars. It also built a capability to\nretaliate. Still, cyber attacks, which were launched through layers of\nother countries’ computers, could not be unambiguously traced back\nto the true perpetrator.\n\nThis escalation by the Cyber Command set the stage for expanded\nforms of warfare in cyberspace. “The Chinese are viewed as the\nsource of a great many attacks on western infrastructure and just\nrecently, the U.S. electrical grid,” General Alexander said in explain-\ning the need for this consolidation. “If that is determined to be an\norganized attack, I would want to go and take down the source of\nthose attacks.” The same retaliation would presumably be used\nagainst Russia, Iran, or any other adversary. Dominance of cyber-\nspace itself now became part of the NSA’s mandate.\n\nEven so, the most important job of the NSA remained intercept-\ning secret information from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.\nTo this end, it had an annual budget of $12.3 billion and some thirty-\nfive thousand military and civilian employees.
