For\n\ninstance, the ratio of AS51 3M ATM IV over HSCEI is at its 4-year high.\n\nCalendar puts are attractively priced given the steep term\nstructure\n\nWith the continuous low realized volatility environment, both\nNKY and HSCEI 3-month minus 12-month term structures\nsteepened to -3.7 vol points, which are near multi-year lows.\n\nAs our Strategists think the Fed now appears concerned about\nsurging asset prices, investors should consider downside\nhedges. Calendar puts, i.e. buying short-dated ATM puts and\nselling long-dated OTM puts, are attractively priced given the\nsteep term structure.\n\nCurrently, we still have an open trade on NKY calendar puts (buy\nJul-17 19,500 puts vs sell Dec-17 17,500 puts) to hedge\ndownside risks.\n\nThe Bo)’s ongoing yield curve control has capped the\nNikkel/Topix ratio and its volatility\n\nJapanese government bond (JGB) yield has been on a downward\ntrend over the last few years and has negatively impacted bank\nearnings. As the Topix has higher weightings in banks than the\n\nNikkei, the NKY/TPX ratio has been grinding higher.\n\nHowever, the NKY/TPX ratio appears to have flattened out since\nthe Bo}’s commitment to maintain the 10-year JGB yield at\naround 0% in September 2016. With global central banks\nincreasingly advocating tighter monetary policies, the market\nmay start to speculate Bo)’s exit strategy and this may reverse\nNKY/TPX’s upward trend. With TPX vol trading below NKY vol,\nbuying TPX calls funded by NKY calls may perform well in such a\nscenario.\n\nBankof America\nMerrill Lynch\n\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017 19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014990",
