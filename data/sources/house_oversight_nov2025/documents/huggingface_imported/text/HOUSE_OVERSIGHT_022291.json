  "text": "54020\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n75 FR 80418-80419 (footnote omitted).\n\nThe Board received a few suggestions\nfor changes to the introduction of the\nnotice. The first comment suggests\nincluding language stating that\nemployees are required to contact their\n“executive manager” or ‘‘administrative\nteam” before contacting the NLRB and\nsuggests that the NLRB refuse to process\nemployees’ complaints until the\nemployees first raise the issue with his\nor her ‘‘management team.” The second\ncomment, from COLLE, urges the Board\nto add language in the introduction\nalerting employees that they also have\nthe right to refrain from engaging in\nunion activity. The comment suggests\nthat by not including the right to refrain\nfrom union activity in the introduction,\nthe Board is showing a bias toward\nunion organizing. The comment argues\nthat a more neutral notice would\ninclude both the right to engage and not\nengage in union activity at the\nbeginning of the document, rather than\nwait to first mention the right to refrain\nin the affirmative rights section.\n\nThe Board does not agree with the\nproposal that employees be required to\ncontact management officials as a\nprerequisite to contacting the Board.\nSuch a procedural requirement is not\ncontemplated in the NLRA and could\ndiscourage employees from exercising\nor vindicating their rights.\n\nThe Board agrees, however, that the\nintroduction should include both the\nrights to engage in union and other\nconcerted activity and the right to\nrefrain from doing so. The Board\nbelieves that adding the right to refrain\nto the introduction will aid in the\nBoard’s approach to present a balanced\nand neutral statement of rights.\nAccordingly, the first sentence in the\nintroduction to the notice in the final\nrule will state:\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)\nguarantees the right of employees to organize\nand bargain collectively with their\nemployers, and to engage in other protected\nconcerted activity or to refrain from engaging\nin any of the above activity.\n\nb. Comments Regarding Affirmative\nStatement of Rights\n\nThe proposed notice contains the\nfollowing statement of affirmative\nrights: Under the NLRA, you have the\nright to:\n\nOrganize a union to negotiate with your\nemployer concerning your wages, hours, and\nother terms and conditions of employment.\n\nForm, join or assist a union.\n\nBargain collectively through\nrepresentatives of employees’ own choosing\nfor a contract with your employer setting\nyour wages, benefits, hours, and other\nworking conditions.\n\nDiscuss your terms and conditions of\nemployment or union organizing with your\nco-workers or a union.\n\nTake action with one or more co-workers\nto improve your working conditions by,\namong other means, raising work-related\ncomplaints directly with your employer or\nwith a government agency, and seeking help\nfrom a union.\n\nStrike and picket, depending on the\npurpose or means of the strike or the\npicketing.\n\nChoose not to do any of these activities,\nincluding joining or remaining a member of\na union.\n\n75 FR 80419.\n\nThe majority of comments addressing\nthe affirmative rights section were\ngeneral and did not specifically address\nthe language of the individual\nprovisions. Generally, labor\norganizations and employee advocate\ngroups favor the Board’s language. A\ncomment from the United Food and\nCommercial Workers International\nUnion asserts that the approach\n“achieves an appropriate balance\nbetween providing sufficiently clear\ninformation about employee’s basic\nstatutory rights and limiting\nunnecessary and confusing information\nabout peripheral rights.’’ On the other\nhand, comments from employer groups\ndo not favor the Board’s language. More\nspecifically, employer groups argue that\nthe notice is biased toward union\norganizing. Generally, the comments\nargue that the right to refrain from\nengaging in union activity should have\na more prominent place on the notice,\nrather than being the last of the rights\nlisted on the poster. Many of these\ncomments contend that the notice\nshould include the right not to engage\nin specific union-related activities.\n\nOther comments about the notice’s\nstatement of affirmative rights are\ndirected at individual provisions of the\nnotice. A discussion of those comments\nis set out in more detail below.\n\ni. The Right To Organize and the Right\nTo Form, Join and Assist a Union\n\nA few comments generally state that\nthe notice should include the\nconsequences of exercising the right to\norganize, join or form a union.1°> For\nexample, several comments argue that\nemployees should be informed that if\nthey join a union they give up the right\nto deal directly with their employers.\nAnother comment argues that\nemployees should be informed of the\ncost of organizing a union, including the\ncost of dues and the potential for the\ncompany to shut down because of\nincreased labor costs associated with a\nunionized workforce. Other comments\n\n105 See, e.g., comment of Pilchak Cohen & Tice.\n\nsuggest including language informing\nemployees that they can be fired for not\npaying their union dues.\n\nThe Board rejects those suggestions.\nThe notice is intended to inform\nemployees of the rights that they have\nunder the NLRA and does not include\nthe benefits or consequences of\nexercising any of the enumerated rights.\nAdding the consequences of one right\nwould require revising the entire notice\nto include potential consequences—\nboth positive and negative—of all the\nprotected rights. For example, the notice\nwould need to include the\nconsequences of refraining from joining\na union, such as not being permitted to\nvote on contract ratifications or attend\nunion membership meetings. The\nnecessary additions to the notice would\ncreate a notice that is not a concise list\nof rights, but more likely a pamphlet-\nsized list of rights and explanations. In\naddition, the consequences of\nunionization are unique to each\nunionized workplace, so it would be\nimpossible to include a list of general\nconsequences that could apply\nuniformly to all unionized workplaces.\nIf employees have questions about the\nimplications of any of their rights, they\ncan contact an NLRB regional office.\n\nAssisted Living Federation of America\n(ALFA) suggests that the affirmative\nrights section should be revised to\nreflect the anti-union position. For\nexample, rather than the current\nprovision that states that employees\nhave a right to “organize a union to\nnegotiate with your employer\nconcerning your wages, hours, and other\nterms and conditions of employment,”\nthe comment suggests the following\nprovision: ‘‘you have the right to\norganize with other employees in\nopposition to a particular union or\nunions.”’ And “you have the right to:\nrefuse to form, join, or assist a union,\nincluding the right to refuse to sign a\nunion card, attend a union meeting or\nsupply a union with information\nconcerning you, your co-worker or your\njob,” rather than “‘[you have the right to]\n[florm, join or assist a union.” The\nBoard disagrees. The Board’s proposed\nnotice language reflects the language of\nthe NLRA itself, which specifically\ngrants affirmative rights, including\nnearly all of those listed in the notice.\nAlso, the notice, like the NLRA, states\nthat employees have the right to refrain\nfrom engaging in all of the listed\nactivities. The Board therefore sees no\nneed to recast the notice to further\nemphasize the right to oppose unions.\n\nii. The Right To Bargain Collectively\n\nTwo comments suggest that the\ncollective-bargaining provision is\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022291",
