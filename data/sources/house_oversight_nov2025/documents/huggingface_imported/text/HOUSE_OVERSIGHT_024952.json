  "text": "means of transportation for the students.\n\nI’ve personally toured most of these areas across the country, and I was very keen on visiting particular areas\nand schools that were the focus of the media. I discovered that the situation on ground is often completely\ndifferent from the picture presented by the media. Of course, these areas need to be given more attention -- and\nthis is exactly what the government has committed itself to since its first day in office. The government efforts\nin that regard are in line with the directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of\nthe UAE.\n\n0A\n\nBy Al Bayan newspaper\n\nAre there any practical measures undertaken by the government to address the issue of\nthe population imbalance? What about offering incentives to the UAE nationals to have\nmore children?\n\nThe government has embarked on certain measures which have been announced earlier and carried by the\nmedia. The committee in charge of the population issues is working quietly and ina very effective manner. The\nUAE Government Strategy has identified a major direction for developing particular steps to address the\npopulation imbalance issue. One of the strategies the UAE government has identified to address this issue\ninvolves focusing on Emiratization through well-planned policy based on combining federal and local efforts.\nIncentives for the UAE nationals to have more children are already in place. UAE nationals are offered several\nincentives either in terms of services, benefits, salary increments or other privileges for their children. The\nUAE government has paid special attention to offering UAE nationals all possible incentives.\n\nBy Al Bayan newspaper\n\nWhy have the UAE Government retreats been stopped?\n\nThe UAE Government retreats have not been put on hold but they are usually organized with relatively long\nintervals. Yet, the Cabinet meetings are convened on regular basis.\nBy Al Bayan newspaper\n\nSome peop le believe that you put more trust in youth rather than veterans to lead Dubai\norganizations. What is your comment on this view?\n\nI’ve trusted, and I will continue to trust well-qualified and experienced youth. If youth are not empowered and\ngiven full opportunities, how expertise and new leaderships will be built?\n\nIn the meantime, I don’t know which age signifies youth. Are they below the age of 35 or 40? Ifa person who\nhas spent 10 or 20 years in his/her workplace and still has not developed any experience, can he/she be\ncategorized as youth? How many years one should spend at work to gain experience -- should we say 5 or 10?\n\nThe world has changed. Knowledge is now accessible to everybody. Training and development programmes\nare also available for those who seek to develop themselves and opt to enhance their competencies to ensure\nsuccessful future career path. Young leaders’ development programmes are also available for all UAE\nnationals who prove themselves worthy through tests carried out by an independent body.\n\nWe look high at our national expertise, both young and veteran. I will continue to explore and discover young\ntalent and offer them full opportunities and push them to assume leading positions.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024952",
