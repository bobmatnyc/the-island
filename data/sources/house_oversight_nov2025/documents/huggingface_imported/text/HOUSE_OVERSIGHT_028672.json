  "text": "ceasefire that many view as a victory for the Islamist group, Hamas Prime\nMinister Ismail Haniyeh finds his popularity having soared. Forty-eight\npercent of Palestinians say that they would rather pick Hantyeh as\nPalestine’s next president instead of Abbas, who has struggled to secure\nthe freedom of movement and self-determination that so many\nPalestinians once expected from his government.\n\nThe JMCC issued similar findings. By far the most disturbing figure in the\npoll is the exponential rise in support among the Palestinian public for\narmed operations against Israel—S0.9 percent now view attacking Israeli\npositions in the current climate as a credible way to express their\ngrievances and pressure the Israeli government to compromise. This is a\n20-percent increase from the previous year.\n\nThe numbers can perhaps best be summarized by Ali Najjar, an 18-year-\nold Palestinian who lives in a refugee camp. “In my view,” he said, “what\nwas taken by force will only be returned by force. Twenty years after\nOslo, we haven’t gained one inch of Palestine.”\n\nMany young Palestinians agree. Indeed, the words summarize the how\ndire the situation has become for an entire generation of Palestinians, most\nof whom are too young to remember the signing of the Oslo Accords in\n1993. Most have not seen any benefit from peace agreements or\nnegotiations, and all of them have grown tired of the settlement\nconstruction in the West Bank, the killing of Palestinian civilians, and the\ninternal fighting among Palestinian politicians that never seems to\ndissipate.\n\nThe Corrosive Status Quo\n\nOne cannot blame Palestinian civilians for feeling this way. The previous\nyear was a terrible one for Abbas and his government. Settlement tenders\nand approvals in the West Bank rose to such an extent that the anti-\nsettlement organization Peace Now named 2012 “the year of the\nsettlement,” with the Ministry of Defense authorizing an additional 6,000\nhousing units and Netanyahu pushing for the construction of 11,000\nhomes in the month of December alone.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028672",
