If not, \nI ask that you forward this e-mail to someone you believe would greatly benefit by having Michael work for \nthem. \nI know that I always appreciate when a friend refers someone who can be of great help to me — personally or in \nbusiness. \nIf you have any questions about working with Michael, please do not hesitate to call me. \nThank you. \nAttached: Cover letter \nResume \nTrump Letter of Recommendation \nSincerely, \nEric Roth \nPresident \ninternational jet \nINTERIORS \nInternational Jet Interiors \n2221 Smithtown Avenue \nLong Island MacArthur Airport \nRonkonkoma, NY 11779 \nPhone \nFax \nCell \ne-mail \nwww.intljet.com website \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029299 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029300",
