  "text": "You and I as One\n\nAny social group can be thought\nof as either a collection of individuals or\nas a single new entity with emergent,\nunified group behavior. When a mob\nforms to surge together down a street\none way and then another; when a flock\nof birds wheels about together, closely\nclustered as they fly without colliding;\nand when an orchestra performs with\nhighly coordinated timing, we\nmomentarily forget about the individuals\nand see the collective behavior as a new,\nsingle social entity. Indeed, as Cacioppo\ndiscusses, many species seem to gather,\nflock, and coordinate to form such\ncollectives. For humans there are many\nsituations from flash mobs and sports\nteams to choirs and audiences, when\npeople congregate in this way.\n\nThe drive for people to affiliate\nand group is not sufficient on its own to\nproduce the coordinated behavior that\nemerges from such a collective.\nSometimes an organizing signal, like the\nconductor of an orchestra, can\nsynchronize the behavior. Other times\ncommon goals and behavioral\nconstraints can synchronize a group, as\nin a flock of birds. In his chapter, Giin\nSemin discusses how such synchrony\nmay be self-organizing — that is, it is\nachieved without intention, effort, or\nawareness by our social brains, even\nwhen there is no clear signal or\nconstraint. In cases of such human\nsociality, the group may act as though it\nhas a single mind. Indeed, Semin\napproaches this issue to relate the\ncollective behavior as an embodied\nconsequence of individual social forces\nthat jointly operate to satisfy our need to\naffiliate, and to consider how connecting\nbehavior through synchrony may create\na collective mind.\n\nPage |65\n\nHoward Nusbaum specifically\ndiscusses a different invisible social\nforce that has evolved with the power to\nbind people into a collective—language.\nLanguage is the richest social signal that\nhas the power to move people to act and\nto move groups to act together. In order\nfor language to act as a force, it must\nsomehow affect people with sufficient\nsocial and emotional impact. As\nNusbaum discusses the impact of\nlanguage, it operates at a social and\nemotional level similar to that discussed\nby Semin rather than exclusively\nthrough the inferences drawn from\nmeaning.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021311",
