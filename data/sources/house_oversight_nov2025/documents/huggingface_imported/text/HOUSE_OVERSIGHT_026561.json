  "text": "pretexts [mojavez'e Shari,\" he explained. \"They can make the case that if they didn't\nfrequent prostitutes and drink alcohol they would appear to be [terrorists] and raise\n\nsuspicions.”\n\nIn essence, the Iranian regime's approach toward sex, like its philosophy of governance, is\nmarked by maslahat, or expediency, and used alternately as a tool of suppression,\ninducement, and incitement. In the summer of 2009, when hundreds of thousands of\nIranians took to the streets to protest Ahmadinejad's reelection, many protesters were\nbrutally beaten by the Basij militia, gangs of young regime thugs on motorbikes who were\ngiven a green light to quell the uprising. As Iranian-American academic Shervin\nMalekzadeh reported from Tehran, the Basij seemed to be driven by a combination of class\nresentment and pent-up frustration. \"They don't screw; they don't drink or smoke joints,”\n\none of his sources told him. \"What else are they going to do with all of that energy?\"\n\nBut perhaps the seminal -- and most heartbreaking -- moment of the Green Revolution\nwas the murder of a 26-year-old female protester, Neda Agha-Soltan, whose bloody death\nwas caught on cell-phone camera and rendered one of the most viral videos in history. In\nan HBO documentary about her life, Neda's mother recalls a message that some\nsympathetic female Basij members relayed to Neda days before she was killed by a sniper:\n\"Dear, please don't come out looking so beautiful.... Do us a favor and don't come out\n\nbecause the Basiji men target beautiful girls. And they will shoot you.\"\n\nWhile the iconic faces of Iran's 1979 revolution were bearded, middle-aged men, Neda has\ncome to symbolize the new face of dissent in 21st-century Iran: a young, modern, educated\nwoman. For her opposition to the regime and to the hijab, she is the embodiment of fitna\n\nin Khamenei's eyes.\n\nTHREE SPRINGS LATER, the Iranian regime once again is faced with a crisis, this\n\ntime of an external variety. As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatens war\nin between meals, the Pentagon plays war games and policy planners huddle in the White\nHouse: Is the Iranian regime rational or irrational? Can diplomatic negotioations prevent\n\nIran from obtaining a bomb, or is an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities inevitable?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026561",
