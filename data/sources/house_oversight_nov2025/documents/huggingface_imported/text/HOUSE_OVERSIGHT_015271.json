  "text": "conspiracy researcher. Off camera, | asked what the turning point had\nbeen for him. He said that it was when his fiancée, a CIA operative, tried to\ninvolve him in drug smuggling, and he refused. Ruppert and | were both\ncolumnists for High Times then, but, he told me, “I don’ t smoke grass.”\n\nThe other panelist was scheduled to be former Nixon speechwriter\nand now bespectacled, drone-voiced personality Ben Stein, but he\ncanceled out at the last minute. Ann Coulter, former Justice Department\nattorney and Senate aide, now a professional reactionary and Stepford\npundit, was at the studio for a subsequent taping about secret societies,\nand she was drafted into taking Stein’ s place. A frequent guest on talk\nshows, Coulter is recognizable by her long blond hair, her short black skirt,\nand her drag-queen aura.\n\nWhen she was a guest on CNBC’ s 7he Big /dea, host Donny\nDeutsch asked her what an ideal country would be like, and she replied\nthat it would be one in which everybody was a Christian. “We just want\nJews to be perfected,” she said. As for Muslims, two days after the\nterrorist attacks on 9/11, she wrote in National Review Online “We\nshould invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to\nChristianity.” But now, the taping of 7he Conspiracy Zone had to be\n\ndelayed because she was still in the makeup room.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015271",
