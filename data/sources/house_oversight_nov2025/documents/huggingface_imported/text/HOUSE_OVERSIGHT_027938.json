  "text": "This interlude instantly conferred on us the desert equivalent of street cred.\nThe next morning, Talik agreed we could accompany the Seventh Brigade as it\nmoved deeper into the Sinai, and peel off when we got closer to Gebel Libni to\ncomplete our “sayeret mission.” Given the early course of the fighting, and our\nforces’ rapid advances in the Sinai, I couldn’t help wondering whether there\nwas any real need to defuse, much less remove, the bugging machinery. But the\nvery fact that the kirya, in the early hours of the war, had still wanted us to try\nwas a reflection of the deep sense of apprehension in Israel in the weeks before\nthe war. Even now, it appeared, there was a concern that the Egyptians might\nreclaim the parts of the Sinai which we had captured.\n\nWhen the armored column got close to Gebel Libni, I pulled our Jeep aside\nand headed for the stretch of communications cable where we’d planted the\nintercept. For several hours, I tried to accomplish in broad daylight what I’d\nfailed to do in the desert darkness four months earlier. But it was no use. I\nfinally told Avraham we’d be better off just blowing it up. I attached an\nexplosive charge and set a two-minute delay. We watched from a couple of\nhundred yards away as the whole assembly disintegrated. Then we rejoined the\nSeventh Brigade.\n\nBefore sunset on the third day of the war, we reached the Egyptian air base\nat Bir Gafgafa in the heart of the Sinai. Even had the war ended then, we would\nhave been in control of a large chunk of the desert buffer zone which Ben-\nGurion had hoped to retain after the 1956 war. But now, more quickly than even\nthe most optimistic planners in the kirva could have anticipated, Talik was\npoised to move on — toward the Suez Canal, and the main towns and cities of\nEgypt. As the Seventh Brigade billeted down in Bir Gafgafa, Talik sent his\nreserve brigade westward, in the direction of the canal.\n\nWe went with them. The battalion was more mobile than a pure tank force,\nbut also more vulnerable: lightly armored French AMX-13s and a collection of\nthe halftracks which I dimly, unfondly, remembered from my fironut. A few of\nthe AMXs led the way, then a line of halftracks, and more tanks at the rear. I\nnosed our Jeep into the middle, behind the battalion commander, a lieutenant-\ncolonel named Ze’ev Eitan. There were scattered groups of Egyptian soldiers on\neither side of us, and they aimed an occasional burst of fire in our direction. But\nthere seemed little point in shooting back. We didn’t need to fight, and it was\nclear that the Egyptians didn’t really want to.\n\nShortly before dark, Lieutenant-Colonel Eitan brought our column to halt.\nThe road we were on cut through tall sandunes on either side. We knew there\n\n90\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027938",
