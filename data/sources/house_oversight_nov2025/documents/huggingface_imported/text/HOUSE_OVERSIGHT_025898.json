And \ncauses a direct damage to IL. \nNoam is so sharp and focused. Really impressive. \nI did not fully understand how the fallacy he sees in the attitude to the Ants example is related to Big Data \nillusions.

So far have only sent a form paragraph in response to requests. Below. \nNoam \nOn Iran, as usual, I'm a gloomy contrarian. I'm glad the treaty was signed, and it's kind of fun to watch the \nRepublican lunatics shrieking hysterically as they try to kill it (as they may). And Israeli hypocrisy has gone \nwell beyond being comical. But in fact the whole thing is farcical, in my opinon. In the US, Iran is \"the \ngreatest threat to world peace\", intoned constantly from on high, in the media, everywhere. There is also such \na thing as world opinion, as measured by such ultra-radicals as Gallup. It turns out that the greatest threat to \nworld peace is the US, by a very wide margin, no one else even close, and Iran barely mentioned. The \nAmerican population is protected from these unwanted facts by the Free Press: not reported. There is an \norganization called US intelligence. They brief Congress regularly on the international security situation, all \nquite public. On Iran, they point out that it has very limited military power, even by regional standards (a \nsmall fraction of Saudi Arabia, for example). Its strategic doctrine is defensive. If— a big If— it has plans for \nnuclear weapons, that would be part of its deterrent strategy. Now who would be opposed to Iran having a \ndeterrent strategy? Answer is clear: the rogue states that rampage violently in the region and don't want any \nimpediment: the US and Israel, also lesser ones like UK and France. One simple way to reduce the threat of \nnuclear weapons would be to establish a nuclear-weapons free zone in the region, as has been done elsewhere \n(over US objections). That's been advocated by the Arab states for 20 years, with very wide global support, \nincluding Iran. It comes up regularly at the 5-year review meetings of the Nonproliferation Treaty, at the UN, \nagain a few months ago, when, again, it was blocked by the US to protect its Israeli client, which has a huge \nnuclear weapons arsenal and wants to keep it. Again, the population is protected from such facts by the Free \nPress (though in this case there are some fringe exceptions, and of course the Arms Control literature). Same \nwith the rest of the litany. Reading the US and UK press is like living in some lunatic asylum. I'm wondering \nwhether to write about it — again; have done so repeatedly. It's like talking to a wall. Iran has an awful \ngovernment, though by the standards of such US allies as Saudi Arabia, it's practically heaven. \nNevertheless, better to have the treaty than not to, given the nature of the asylum. \nNoam \nFrom: jeffrey E.

It has a \nrecord of colossal failure, and for good reasons, I think. It's disproven, but keeps coming back, most recently with Big \nData illusions. \nA child doesn't grow arms and legs rather than wings, or a mammalian vs insect visual system, the way an ant \nsearches for food. Rather, the path of development is sharply restricted (and evolution follows constraints \ntoo). Acquisition of language (and other cognitive achievements) seems very much like physical growth. \nHighly contentious in the field, but in my opinion that's a comment on the failures of the field. \nFrom: jeffrey E.
