  "text": "My initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. I still think that is the best idea. The\nstock is now down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding\nmergers. So I think it makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we\nhopefully get more clarity from management.\n\nPaul Barrett\nAlpha Group Capital LLC\n142 W 57\" Street, 11\" Floor, New York, NY 10019\n\n<image001.jpg>\n\nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>\nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 1:55 PM\n\nTo: Paul Barrett a >\nCe: Richard K:hn\n\nSubject: Re: AVGO\n\nIve had enough!!!!|_ Which puts ???\n\nOn Fri, Jul 13, 2018 at 1:40 PM Paul Barrett <r wrote:\nAny thoughts on the AVGO Aug puts?
