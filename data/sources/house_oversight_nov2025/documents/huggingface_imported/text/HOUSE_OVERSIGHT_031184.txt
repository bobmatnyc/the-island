Chief Deputy Whip Diana DeGette is serving her 8th term in
Congress as the Representative of the First District in Colorado. Diana has
established herself as a leader for progressive change on LGBT rights, health
care, reproductive rights, food safety, consumer protection and the
environment.

Diana serves on the powerful Commuttee on Energy and Commerce where
she has used her position to improve health care, expand medical research,
reform corporate business and accounting practices, ensure that our
homeland is adequately protected, take on global climate change, and move
America toward energy independence.

She has led the efforts to expand the State Children's Health Insurance
Program (SCHIP), which provides health insurance to low-income children
up to age 18. Diana was a leader in the expansion of this program that
was signed into law by President Obama in February of 2009.

Diana was the chief architect of legislation to expand stem cell research,
which was passed twice with broad, bipartisan support in Congress. One of
Congress’s leading experts on cutting-edge scientific research, Diana ts the
author of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act which would ensure a
lasting ethical framework overseeing stem cell research at the National
Institutes of Health (NIA) and will provide stability to the scientists and
individuals who are on the quest for life-saving cures.

As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Diabetes Caucus, Diana has
also been a long-time advocate for the expansion of diabetes care and
research, particularly for lower-income and munority communities.
