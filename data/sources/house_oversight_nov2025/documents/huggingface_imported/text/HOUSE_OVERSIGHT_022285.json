  "text": "54014\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n16, 1949), promulgating 29 CFR 516.18,\nthe predecessor to 29 CFR 516.4.\n\n5. The Teamsters 357 Decision\n\nIn response to the NPRM, the U.S.\nChamber of Commerce submitted a\ncomment that questions “‘how the\nproposal can be said to be consistent\nwith” the Supreme Court’s decision in\nLocal 357, International Brotherhood of\nTeamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961).\nSpecifically, the Chamber accuses the\nBoard of ignoring the Court’s\nadmonition in that case warning that\n“Twl]here * * * Congress has aimed its\nsanctions only at specific discriminatory\npractices, the Board cannot go farther\nand establish a broader, more pervasive\nregulatory scheme.” Id. at 675. The\nChamber reads this statement out of\ncontext.\n\nTo understand why the Board\ndisagrees with the Chamber’s view,\nfurther explanation of Teamsters 357 is\nnecessary. In that case, the Supreme\nCourt rejected the Board’s conclusion\nthat a union had committed an unfair\nlabor practice by operating an exclusive\nhiring hall pursuant to an agreement\nthat contained a nondiscrimination\nclause but not three additional clauses\nthat the Board had previously declared\nin its Mountain Pacific decision to be\nnecessary to prevent “ ‘unlawful\nencouragement of union membership.’ ”’\nId. at 671 (quoting Mountain Pacific\nChapter, 119 NLRB 883, 897 (1958)).\nThe Court first noted that Congress had\nexamined the operation of hiring halls\nand had decided not to ban them. Id. at\n673-74. Next, the Court observed that\nNLRA Section 8(a)(3) ‘“‘‘does not outlaw\nall encouragement or discouragement of\nmembership in labor organizations; only\nsuch as is accomplished by\ndiscrimination is prohibited.’ ”’ Id. at\n674-75 (emphasis added) (quoting\nRadio Officers’ Union v. NLEBB, 347 U.S.\n17, 42-43 (1954)). Since the hiring hall\nagreement at issue in Teamsters 357\n“specifically provide[d] that there will\nbe no discrimination * * * because of\nthe presence or absence of union\nmembership,” the Court determined\nthat the Board was attempting to protect\nagainst nondiscriminatory\nencouragement of union membership.\nId, at 675. This was impermissible\nbecause “[wlhere * * * Congress has\naimed its sanctions only at specific\ndiscriminatory practices, the Board\ncannot go farther and establish a\nbroader, more pervasive regulatory\nscheme.” Id. at 676.\n\nProperly understood, Teamsters 357\ndoes not preclude the Board from\nissuing the notice posting rule. The\nunion had not committed an unfair\nlabor practice in that case because its\n\nhiring hall agreement did not encourage\nor discourage union membership by\n“discrimination.” See id. at 674-75. By\nfaulting the union for not including in\nits agreement clauses that the Board’s\nMountain Pacific rule had declared\nnecessary to prevent “ ‘unlawful\nencouragement of union membership,’ ”\nid. at 671 (quoting Mountain Pacific\nChapter, 119 NLRB at 897), the Board\nhad attempted to regulate hiring halls in\na manner that was facially inconsistent\nwith the discrimination requirement\nembedded in NLRA Section 8(a)(3) and\n(b)(2). Accordingly, the Chamber makes\ntoo much of the Court’s statement\nprohibiting the Board from\n“establish[ing] a broader, more\npervasive regulatory scheme” when\n“specific discriminatory practices’ have\nalready been outlawed. Id. at 676. By\nthat, the Court simply meant to remind\nthe Board that it may not\nadministratively amend Section 8(a)(3)\nand (b)(2) to prohibit nondiscriminatory\nactivity that might be viewed as\nundesirable because those statutory\nsections are clearly aimed only at\n“specific discriminatory practices.”\nId.46\n\nThis rulemaking does not involve\nthose provisions of the NLRA that\nTeamsters 357 addressed. Accordingly,\nthe Board does not view that case as\ncontrolling the outcome of this\nproceeding.\n\n6. Miscellaneous Matters\n\nThe Center on National Labor Policy,\nInc., argues that the Board ‘‘must be\nmindful of the Supreme Court’s\nadmonition in Lechmere, Inc.] v. NLRB,\n502 U.S. 527, 534 (1992), that an\nemployer possesses First Amendment\nrights to its property.’’ The Board\ndisagrees that the property rights\ndiscussed in Lechmere emanate from\nthe First Amendment, see Thunder\nBasin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200,\n217 n.21 (1994) (“The right of\nemployers to exclude union organizers\nfrom their private property emanates\nfrom state common law * * *.”), and to\nthe extent that the Center’s reference to\nthe First Amendment asserts a conflict\nbetween these regulations and\nemployers’ right to free speech, that\nargument is rejected for reasons\nexplained above. After quoting\nextensively from Lechmere, the Center\nnext contends that “‘if a union has no\naccess to company property to\ncommunicate with employees, neither\n\n46 To the extent that the Board espoused a\ncontrary view of Teamsters 357 in a prior\nrulemaking proceeding, that view is abandoned. See\nUnion Dues Regulation, 57 FR 43635, 43637-38\n(Sept. 22, 1992), withdrawn, 61 FR 11167 (Mar. 19,\n1996).\n\ndoes the Board without Section 10(c)\nauthority.” The Board rejects this\nargument because it fails to recognize\nthe important substantive difference\nbetween the conduct at issue in\nLechmere, which involved “‘trespassory\norganizational activity’”’ by\nnonemployees on the employer’s\ngrounds, id. at 535 (quoting Sears,\nRoebuck & Co. v. San Diego Dist.\nCouncil of Carpenters, 436 U.S. 180, 205\n(1978)), and the regulations here which\ninvolve nothing more than the\nemployer’s responsibility to post an\nofficial notice of legal rights.\n\nThe Portland Cement Association\n(PCA) comments that the Board’s failure\nto place the three law review articles\nthat the Board cited to the NPRM #7 in\nthe administrative docket is arbitrary\nand capricious. Although the Board\nprovided the legal citations for these\narticles, PCA believes that it should not\nhave to pay an electronic legal reporting\nservice to access the material. The Board\nhas placed these articles in the hard\ncopy docket, but has not uploaded these\narticles to the electronic docket at\nhttp://www.regulations.gov, because\nsuch an action could violate copyright\nlaws.48\n\nFinally, one comment contends that\nrequiring employers to set aside wall\nspace for posting the notices violates the\nTakings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\nto the U.S. Constitution. The comment\ncites no authority for this proposition,\nwhich would seem to invalidate the\nnotice-posting requirements under all\nother Federal and state workplace\nstatutes. Accordingly, the Board rejects\nthis contention.\n\nIn conclusion, the Board believe that\nit has fully demonstrated that it\npossesses sufficient statutory authority\nto enact the final rule, and therefore that\nit is not “‘in excess of statutory\njurisdiction” or “short of statutory\nright’ within the meaning of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, Section\n706(2)(C), 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(C).\n\nC. Factual Support for the Rule\n\nAs stated above, the Board found that\nthe notice posting rule is needed\nbecause it believes that many employees\nare unaware of their NLRA rights and\ntherefore cannot effectively exercise\nthose rights. The Board based this\nfinding on several factors: the\ncomparatively small percentage of\nprivate sector employees who are\nrepresented by unions and thus have\nready access to information about the\n\n47 See NPRM, 75 FR 80411 and fn. 3 above.\n\n48 The Board has also placed the other non-case\nmaterials cited to in this final rule into the hard\ncopy docket.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022285",
