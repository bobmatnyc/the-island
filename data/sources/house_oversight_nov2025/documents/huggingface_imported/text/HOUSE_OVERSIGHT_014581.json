  "text": "SECTION III\n\n2017 Financial Markets\nOutlook: The Horns of\na Dilemma\n\nINVESTORS HAVE HAD AN AMAZING BULL RUN. Including last\nyear’s 12% total return, the S&P 500 is nearly 3.5 times as high\nas its financial crisis trough. The advance has been equally long-\nlasting, second in length only to the almost-decade-long period\nthat preceded the technology bubble in 2000. These impressive\ngains are not limited to just equities or US assets. US corporate\nhigh yield has gained 177% over the same time span, while the\ntotal return of the MSCI All Country World Index excluding\nthe United States has been higher only 5% of the time over\ncomparable eight-year periods since 1994.\n\nBut as we begin a new year, these gains have left investors\non the horns of a dilemma. Put simply, they must now choose\nto either remain invested at high valuations and bear the\nassociated risk of loss or exit the market and forgo the potential\nfor upside surprises as well as returns that are attractive\ncompared to the alternatives.\n\n48 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014581",
