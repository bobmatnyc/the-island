  "text": "To give a robust account for the\npractice of medicine, one must explain\nwhy sick and debilitated strangers are\nworthy of attention and care, and how\nthe medical arts contribute to human\nflourishing. For some Americans, such\naccounts begin in secular moral\ntradition, but for most they begin in\nreligion; nine out of ten Americans\nendorse a religious affiliation’. Either\nway, medicine looks beyond science to\nfind a vision that animates care of the\nsick, a moral framework that guides the\napplication of medical technology, and\npractices that nurture and extend the\nhuman capacity to care for patients as\npersons rather than as mere objects. In\nthis sense, even though religious\nconcepts are rarely made explicit in\npublic and professional discourse about\nmedicine, they are everywhere implicit\nand operative, and necessarily so.\n\nWhy care for the sick?\n\nHumans in all cultures are moved\nto care for the sick. The question is why?\nThe concept of the social brain provides\nthe beginning of an answer. The peculiar\nhuman need and capacity for\nconstructive, complex and meaningful\nrelationships seems to involve\nneurological structures and functions\nthat also facilitate attending to the sick.\nFor example, Epley describes the human\ncapacity to pay attention to our own\nmindedness and the mindedness of\nothers. We are not only conscious of\nourselves, but we are conscious of others\nbeing conscious of themselves and of us.\nThis capacity allows us to be mindful of\nothers’ bodily suffering and mindful of\ntheir consciousness of our relation to\nthem in that suffering. To mindfulness is\nadded the capacity to empathize. Decety\ndescribes a neurological structure\nthrough which the sight of pain in\nanother person triggers a response in our\n\n140\n\nPage\n\nown brains that mirrors (albeit at a level\nattenuated by training and other\ncontextual factors) the response we\nwould have if we were suffering the pain\nourselves. These features of the human\nbrain allow us to pay attention to and to\nsome extent share in the suffering of\nothers—capacities that are psychological\nbuilding blocks for caring for the sick.\n\nYet to explain medicine strictly\non the basis of empirical science, one\nmust solve a particularly thorny version\nof the more general problem of\nexplaining altruistic human behavior.\nDecety notes, “The emergence of\naltruism, of empathizing with and caring\nfor those who are not kin, is ... not\neasily explained within the framework of\nneo-Darwinian theories of natural\nselection.” Indeed one can scarcely\nimagine a practice less conducive to the\nreproductive fitness of a population than\nspending enormous resources caring for\nthe sick, the deformed, the weak, and the\naged. Natural selection and the physician\nwould seem to be at cross-purposes: one\nworks to eliminate the sickly, the other\nto save them from elimination. On this\naccount, medicine appears to be the sort\nof dead end into which the evolutionary\nprocess sometimes blindly drifts.\n\nCacioppo, however, argues that\naltruistic behaviors can be explained\nwithin evolutionary theory by paying\nattention to inclusive fitness and the\nmultiple levels of selective pressure:\n\n...for species born to a period of\nutter dependency [e.g., humans],\nthe genes that find their way into\nthe gene pool are not defined\nsolely or even mostly by\nlikelihood that an organism will\nreproduce but by the likelihood\nthat the offspring of the parent\nwill live long enough to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021386",
