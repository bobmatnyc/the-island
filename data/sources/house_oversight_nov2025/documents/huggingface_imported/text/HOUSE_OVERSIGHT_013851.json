  "text": "I read the front-page headlines through the newspaper machines as I walk to lunch each day and\nnothing more. In five years, I haven’t had a single problem due to this selective ignorance. It gives you\nsomething new to ask the rest of the population in lieu of small talk: “Tell me, what’s new in the\nworld?” And, if it’s that important, you'll hear people talking about it. Using my crib notes approach to\nworld affairs, I also retain more than someone who loses the forest for the trees in a sea of extraneous\ndetails.\n\nFrom an actionable information standpoint, I consume a maximum of one-third of one industry\nmagazine (Response magazine) and one business magazine (/nc.) per month, for a grand total of\napproximately four hours. That’s it for results-oriented reading. I read an hour of fiction prior to bed for\nrelaxation.\n\nHow on earth do I act responsibly? Let me give an example of how I and other NR both consider and\n\nobtain information. I voted in the last presidential election,2 despite having been in Berlin. I made my\ndecision in a matter of hours. First, I sent e-mails to educated friends in the U.S. who share my values\nand asked them who they were voting for and why. Second, I judge people based on actions and not\nwords; thus, I asked friends in Berlin, who had more perspective outside of U.S. media propaganda, how\nthey judged the candidates based on their historical behavior. Last, I watched the presidential debates.\nThat was it. I let other dependable people synthesize hundreds of hours and thousands of pages of media\nfor me. It was like having dozens of personal information assistants, and I didn’t have to pay thema\nsingle cent.\n\nThat’s a simple example, you say, but what if you need to learn to do something your friends haven’t\ndone? Like, say, sell a book to the world’s largest publisher as a first-time author? Funny you should\nask. There are two approaches I used:\n\n1. I picked one book out of dozens based on reader reviews and the fact that the authors had actually\ndone what I wanted to do. If the task is how-to in nature, I only read accounts that are “how I did it” and\nautobiographical. No speculators or wannabes are worth the time.\n\n2. Using the book to generate intelligent and specific questions, I contacted 10 of the top authors and\nagents in the world via e-mail and phone, with a response rate of 80%.\n\nI only read the sections of the book that were relevant to immediate next steps, which took less than\ntwo hours. To develop a template e-mail and call script took approximately four hours, and the actual e-\nmails and phone calls took less than an hour. This personal contact approach is not only more effective\nand more efficient than all-you-can-eat info buffets, it also provided me with the major league alliances\nand mentors necessary to sell this book. Rediscover the power of the forgotten skill called “talking.” It\nworks.\n\nOnce again, less is more.\n\nHow to Read 200% Faster in 10 Minutes\n\nTrex will be times when, it’s true, you will have to read. Here are four simple tips that will lessen the\ndamage and increase your speed at least 200% in 10 minutes with no comprehension loss:\n1. Two Minutes: Use a pen or finger to trace under each line as you read as fast as possible.\n\nReading is a series of jumping snapshots (called saccades), and using a visual guide prevents\nregression.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013851",
