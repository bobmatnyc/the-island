  "text": "I first met Frank Wilczek in the 1980s, when he invited me to his home in Princeton to\ntalk about anyons. “The address is 112 Mercer Street,” he wrote. “Look for the house\nwith no driveway.” So there I was, a few hours later, in Einstein’s old living room,\ntalking to a future recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics. If Frank was as impressed as I\nwas by the surroundings, you’d never guess it. His only comment concerned the difficulty\nof finding a parking place in front of a “house with no driveway.”\n\nUnlike most theoretical physicists, Frank has long had a keen interest in Al, as\nwitnessed in these three “Observations”’:\n\n1. “Francis Crick called it ‘the Astonishing Hypothesis’: that consciousness, also\nknown as Mind, is an emergent property of matter,” which, if true, indicates that “all\nintelligence is machine intelligence. What distinguishes natural from artificial\nintelligence is not what it is, but only how it is made.”\n\n2. “Artificial intelligence is not the product of an alien invasion. It is an artifact\nof a particular human culture and reflects the values of that culture.”\n\n3. “David Hume's striking statement ‘Reason Is, and Ought only to Be, the Slave\nof the Passions’ was written in 1738 [and] was, of course, meant to apply to human\nreason and human passions. ... But Hume’s logical/philosophical point remains valid\nfor Al. Simply put: Incentives, not abstract logic, drive behavior.”\n\nHe notes that “the big story of the 20th and the 21st century is that [as]\ncomputing develops, we learn how to calculate the consequences of the [fundamental]\nlaws better and better. There’s also a feedback cycle: When you understand matter\nbetter, you can design better computers, which will enable you to calculate better. It’s\nkind of an ascending helix.”\n\nHere he argues that human intelligence, for now, holds the advantage—yet our\nfuture, unbounded by our solar system and doubtless also by our galaxy, will never be\nrealized without the help of our AIs.\n\n55\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016275",
