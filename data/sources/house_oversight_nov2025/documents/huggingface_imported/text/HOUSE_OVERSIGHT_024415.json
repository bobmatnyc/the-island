  "text": "asymmetry we have accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST place the Koran above all law while in\nAmerica, the Constitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad , founder of CAIR, reputedly said, “Islam isn’t in\nAmer ica to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in\nAmerica and Islam is the only accepted religion on Earth.” Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the\nControl Factor constantly seeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be\nnegotiated. Only one can survive not because we have declared “war” but because our Islamic Enemy has.\nThat is, perhaps, the lesson we will most need to fully learn, one way or another. We will eventually hit a\nTurnaround Moment as a nation and if enough of us are not truly prepared to fight and continue to be\ncontrolled by our delusions, we will lose. If we truly seek to win, it is better to get there sooner while we have\nadvantages than later.\n\nFP: Bill Siegel, thank you for joining FrontPage Interview.\nAnd thank you for writing this superb and most important book.\n\nWe encourage all o f our readers to get their hands on The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True\nThreat and to read it!\n\nEditor’s note: To watch The Glazov Gang‘s recent discussion about the Muslim Brotherhood’s\ninfiltration of the United States and the Obama administration, see this week’s episode below:\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nFiled Under: Daily Mailer, FrontPage Tagged With: Denial, Islam, muslim brotherhood, Obama, Siegel, The\nControl Factor\n\n22\n\n= Print This Post\nAbout Jamie Glazov\n\nJamie Glazov is Frontpage Magazine's editor.

The mental side is a minefield of constructs,\ndeeply implanted within generations of Americans, and its PC chickens are coming home to roost. So much\nso, millions of Americans (westerners) cannot break free of its shackles. But it is not as if these mental chains\nmagically appe ared. Far from it - http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/1 1/26/the-death-of-...\n\nIn addition, the fault-lines of democracy allowed for the most retrograde forces, on this planet, to infiltrate\nand penetrate the body politic- http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/09/02/the-subversio...\n\nIF the mental and physical constraints are not immediately removed, it is a given that western civilization will\nfall. Cause and effect.\nAdina Kutnicki, Israel - http://adinakutnicki.com/about/\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024415",
