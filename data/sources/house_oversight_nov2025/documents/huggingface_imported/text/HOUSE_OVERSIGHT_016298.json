  "text": "Indeed, Wiener gave scientific teeth to the idea that in the workings of history,\npolitics, and society, ideas matter. Beliefs, ideologies, norms, laws, and customs, by\nregulating the behavior of the humans who share them, can shape a society and power the\ncourse of historical events as surely as the phenomena of physics affect the structure and\nevolution of the solar system. To say that ideas—and not just weather, resources,\ngeography, or weaponry—can shape history is not woolly mysticism. It is a statement of\nthe causal powers of information instantiated in human brains and exchanged in networks\nof communication and feedback. Deterministic theories of history, whether they identify\nthe causal engine as technological, climatological, or geographic, are belied by the causal\npower of ideas. The effects of these ideas can include unpredictable lurches and\noscillations that arise from positive feedback or from miscalibrated negative feedback.\n\nAn analysis of society in terms of its propagation of ideas also gave Wiener a\nguideline for social criticism. A healthy society—one that gives its members the means\nto pursue life in defiance of entropy—allows information sensed and contributed by its\nmembers to feed back and affect how the society is governed. A dysfunctional society\ninvokes dogma and authority to impose control from the top down. Wiener thus\ndescribed himself as “a participant in a liberal outlook,” and devoted most of the moral\nand rhetorical energy in the book (both the 1950 and 1954 editions) to denouncing\ncommunism, fascism, McCarthyism, militarism, and authoritarian religion (particularly\nCatholicism and Islam) and to warning that political and scientific institutions were\nbecoming too hierarchical and insular.\n\nWiener’s book is also, here and there, an early exemplar of an increasingly\npopular genre, tech prophecy. Prophecy not in the sense of mere prognostications but in\nthe Old Testament sense of dark warnings of catastrophic payback for the decadence of\none’s contemporaries. Wiener warned against the accelerating nuclear arms race, against\ntechnological change that was imposed without regard to human welfare (“[W]e must\nknow as scientists what man’s nature is and what his built-in purposes are”), and against\nwhat today is called the value-alignment problem: that “the machine like the djinnee,\nwhich can learn and can make decisions on the basis of its learning, will in no way be\nobliged to make such decisions as we should have made, or will be acceptable to us.” In\nthe darker, 1950 edition, he warned of a “threatening new Fascism dependent on the\nmachine a gouverner.”\n\nWiener’s tech prophecy harks back to the Romantic movement’s rebellion against\nthe “dark Satanic mills” of the Industrial Revolution, and perhaps even earlier, to the\narchetypes of Prometheus, Pandora, and Faust. And today it has gone into high gear.\nJeremiahs, many of them (like Wiener) from the worlds of science and technology, have\nsounded alarms about nanotechnology, genetic engineering, Big Data, and particularly\nartificial intelligence. Several contributors to this volume characterize Wiener’s book as\na prescient example of tech prophecy and amplify his dire worries.\n\nYet the two moral themes of The Human Use of Human Beings—the liberal\ndefense of an open society and the dystopian dread of runaway technology—are in\ntension. A society with channels of feedback that maximize human flourishing will have\nmechanisms in place, and can adapt them to changing circumstances, in a way that can\ndomesticate technology to human purposes. There’s nothing idealistic or mystical about\nthis; as Wiener emphasized, ideas, norms, and institutions are themselves a form of\ntechnology, consisting of patterns of information distributed across brains.
