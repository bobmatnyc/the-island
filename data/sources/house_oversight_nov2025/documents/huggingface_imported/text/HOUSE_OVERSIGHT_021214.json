  "text": "with the knowledge of being able to help out in some way. ! had to tell\nmy story no matter how shameful it was to even speak about. Putting my\nshame aside I had to derive every bit of courage I could sustain and now I\nam ready to tell it. The hardest lesson I had failed at learning until later\non in my life became my strength, the belief in my inner voice and the\nability to speak up. I do have a voice and now the world is going to hear\nit in my whispered cries for justice. Swept away by a surge of media with\none phone call I sent Jeffrey’s publicist into frenzy. Not to mention the\nrelease of the photos showing the first night that Prince Andrew and I\nshared together that I so happened to unveil for the public to see.\n\nI spent too much of my life going out of my mind waiting for the\nrescue that never came until it was too late and then the scars were\nalready imbedded deeply within. Thankfully I am now free from the\nstruggles that nearly destroyed the love inside of my heart. I only wish it\ncould be the same for the other victims, not just of Jeffrey’s inflictions\nbut every person who has ever suffered at the hands of another.\n\nI’m here to tell you from my own experience that the moon is yours if\nthat’s what you want, all you have to do is stand up and take it. If some\ngirl off the streets of Florida, like me, can stand up against the tyrants that\nrun the deep pockets of our world, than anyone can. Just like I needed to\nbelieve that someone stood up for me once like Robbie did long ago, I\nnow stand up for us. For all of us girls, the ones who are still on the\nstreets and think they don’t deserve better or it’s an unachievable dream\nto be entitled to more out of life. For all of the beautiful girls who don’t\nsee beyond they’re outside appearance. For all the girls still trapped in\nenslavement and unable to get out of the abuse that holds them down. But\nmost of all, I stand up for every girls belief in love, because it is the very\nsavior of my spirit and soul.\n\nThe End\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Virginia Roberts\n\n139 140\n\nTi Copyright Protected Material O Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL, GIUFFRE004272 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004273\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021214",
