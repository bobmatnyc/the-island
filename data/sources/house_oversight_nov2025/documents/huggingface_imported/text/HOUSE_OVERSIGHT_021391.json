  "text": "capacities that can be employed to care\nfor patients. Science gives knowledge of\nthe remarkable neurological and\npsychological features of the social brain\nthat make activities like caring for the\nsick possible. But science can also\ndepersonalize the patient viewed through\nthe eyes of the physician scientist.\nReligions (and other moral communities)\nmotivates an attention to the person who\nis the patient, providing a fuller vision\nfor the worthiness of caring for the sick,\nand drawing the physician and patient\ncloser together. Religion and moral\ncommunities can also provide a\nframework to guide the application of\nmedical science in that endeavor, and\npractices that strengthen the human\ncapacity for treating patients as the\nmindful persons they are. It is the\nbalance of the tensions produced by the\nforces of science and religion that may\nhold a key to better medical practice and\npatient care.\n\nReferences\n\n1 Curlin FA, Lantos JD, Roach CJ,\nSellergren SA, Chin MH.\nReligious characteristics of U.S\nphysicians: A national survey.
