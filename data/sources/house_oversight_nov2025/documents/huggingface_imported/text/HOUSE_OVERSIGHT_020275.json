  "text": "[23\n\ndocuments than he knew about,” a former CIA station chief speculated. It could also account for\nthe disparity between the claims of Snowden and the NSA damage assessment as to the number\nof the documents that were compromised.\n\nAs farfetched as this mole scenario may seem to the outside world, less than three years before\nthe Snowden breach, the NSA had received a warning from a CIA mole, which will be discussed\nin greater detail in Chapter 21, that the Russian Intelligence service might have recruited a KGB\nmole at the Fort Meade headquarters of the NSA. No mole was found in 2010, and, if one\nexisted, it could not have been Snowden, who at that time in 2010 was working for the NSA in\nJapan. Such a putative mole conceivably could have acquired enough information to later\nfacilitate Snowden’s operation.\n\nIn this scenario, Snowden would not be difficult to spot as a potential collaborator and\npossible umbrella. As Snowden acknowledges, he was not a happy worker at the NSA. He\ncomplained between 2010 and 2013 about what he considered NSA abuses to coworkers,\nsuperiors and in his posts over the Internet. If someone assumed the guise of a reluctant whistle-\nblower, he would have little difficulty in approaching Snowden. Snowden might not even know\nhis true affiliation beyond that he shared Snowden’s anti-surveillance views. If Snowden then\nvoiced an interest in exposing the NSA’s secrets, this person could supply him with the necessary\nguidance, steering a still unsuspecting Snowden first to the Booz Allen position and afterwards to\nhis associates in Hong Kong. By taking sole credit for the coup in the video that he made with\nPoitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong, he acted, as he told Greenwald, to divert suspicion from\nanyone else. This move could also any collaborator he may have had in Hawaii time to cover his\ntracks.\n\nThe astronomer Carl Sagan famously said in regard to searching the universe for signals from\nother civilizations that the “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” That injunction also\napplies to the spooky universe of espionage. The fact that a mole hunt fails to find a hidden\ncollaborator at the NSA does not necessarily mean such a mole does not exist. Historically, we\nhave many notable cases in which Russian moles eluded intensive investigations for many\ndecades. Robert Hanssen served as a KGB penetration in the FBI for over 20 years without being\ncaught. Similarly, Aldrich Ames, acted as a KGB mole in the CIA for more than ten years, and\npassed all the CIA’s sophisticated lie detector tests. Both Hanssen and Ames eluded intensive FBI\nand CIA investigations that lasted over a decade. According to Victor Cherkashin, their KGB\ncase officer, who I interviewed in Moscow in 2015, the KGB was able to hide their existence\nfrom investigators for such a long period partly because of the widespread belief in U.S.\nintelligence that moles were fictional creatures that sprung from the “paranoid mind” of James\nJesus Angleton. When I then cited the signature line from the movie Zhe Usual Suspects “The\ngreatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.” Cherkashin thinly\nsmiled and said “CIA denial [of moles] certainly helped.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020275",
