There are four companies in San Francisco\nthat are under consideration amongst which we will opt for one; The Outcast Agency,\nSpark, SutherlandGold Group, and Brew. Usually, these companies charge $15,000 to\n$20,000 per month for their services.\n\nFeature articles and product reviews will help launch awareness of our platform.\nOnline advertisement will help with buyer impressions. The top 20 to 30 customers in\neach segment will be approached first; a few sales hits in these top tiers will enable\nachievement of targeted forecasts.\n\nSales Plan\n\nIn the first couple of months, the company will set up the office, hire a competent PR\nfirm and members of sales/business development to generate sales. There will be no\nsales activity during this time span. Revenue will begin to flow in by the end of the first\nsix months.\n\nInsightsPod expects to generate revenue from a subscription-based model. In order to\ndemonstrate the capability of our platform, InsightsPod's website will display limited\nlive insights on popular topics. Currently, we are displaying live insights on the US\npresidential election's candidates and the Apple iPhone 7. In addition to this, key\ncontacts with senior writers at Wired Magazine, Business Week, CNet, and ZDnet\nwill bring positive national attention to our technology.\n\nWe anticipate that the initial revenues will come from businesses who will subscribe to\nour service. InsightsPod will rigorously pursue government contracts from federal, state\nand local governments. InsightsPod can be used by LEA to detect criminal and terrorist\n\n| Page 8 |\n\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.
