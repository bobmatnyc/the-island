  "text": "campaign w our allies? We should be standing with Syrian people in a more public\nway.\n\nGeneral Hoss Cartwright . We need to inventory the tools we have and then define\nour actions. Stop supplies to Assad; provide command and control assets (radios) to\nrebels; provide intelligence; develop knowledge and planning for securing WMD.\nWe need to answer the above questions as part of defining our policy. Intel and\narms are happening. We also need armed observers to know what’s going on; need\nsafe harbors that have a protective flank in order to provide good logistics and\nsupply. Syria is far more difficult in this regard than was Libya. We need strategy\nand structures to prevent mass atrocities. Will we put boots on the ground.\n\nSteve Hadley (ex Bush): Need to assure ourselves and the Syrians that we are\naligning with the Syrian people. Forget the UN. This will send a critical message to\nChina and Russia that they don’t have a veto on US policy. Gain legitimacy by\naligning with Turkey and others. Send a strong and clear message to business and\nmilitary community in Syria that we are going to see this through and they should\nditch Assad now.\n\nBill Perry: I support near term intervention, but not boots on the ground. Support\nenforcing no fly — no drive zones. Bring Turkey into operations. US must\nparticipate with its unique capabilities (e.g. AWACs) and let others participate with\nless unique assets (supplying arms etc.). There is no prospect of UN cooperation.\nBut a coalition of the willing (UK, Arab League) will give us the legitimancy we\nneed. Very good prospect of military success. Reasonable prospect of success on\nhumanitariean side. We should act, but in a fashion that has most of the action on\nthe backs of the rebles.\n\nMadeleine A: Must intervene. How do we structure intervention. Didn’t use UN\nin Kosovo and shouldn’t use it now.\n\nJim Steinberg (ex Obama). Must be certainty in everyone’s mind as to outcome\n(ie.that Assad is out). Take nothing off the table.\n\nDennis Ross (ex Obama): Costs and consequences of intervention have been\ndiscussed, but most of these consequences and costs will come to fruition whether\nwe go in or don’t go in, therefore we should go in and impact the outcome. Reach\nout to KSA and Alawites. Don’t dither over analysis.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025804",
