  "text": "Chapter Three\n\nI reported for induction on the second Sunday of November 1959, three\nmonths short of my eighteenth birthday. Military service was a near-universal\nrite of passage for Israeli teenagers. For children of the kibbutz, it held even\ngreater significance. Now that we had a country, the kibbutzniks’ role as the\navant-garde in taming and farming the land had ceased to be relevant. But the\nsense of mission we’d been raised with — what we were led to believe set us\napart from the mere “city-dwellers” — drove us to aspire, maybe even assume,\nwe would leave an imprint in other spheres of the new state’s life. I doubt it’s an\naccident that nearly every one of the boys with whom I grew up in Mishmar\nHasharon went on to become an officer during his time in the military.\n\nJudging from my own first few weeks in uniform, however, there was every\nreason to believe I would end up as an unfortunate, undistinguished exception.\n\nThis was not due to lack of ambition. In fact, I thought at first of joining the\nair force. But a question on the application form asked whether I ever suffered\nfrom any breathing discomfort. Like almost everyone on the kibbutz, I did get a\nbit clogged up when the weather turned cold and damp. So I naively answered\nyes, ending any chance of training as a pilot. My fallback choice was a tank\nunit. But when I joined the hundreds of other draftees at the processing center\nnear Tel Aviv, about a hundred of us were shunted, by alphabetical lottery, into\ntraining for armored personnel carriers instead. Known as battle taxis, the APCs\nwhich Israel had at the time were lumbering, World War Two-vintage\nhalftracks.\n\nOur training battalion was based, alongside the country’s main armored\nbrigade, in a huge, hillside army camp outside Beersheva in the Negev. I knew\nthat our fironut — basic training — would be tough. That was the whole point.\nBut we endured a seemingly endless array of inspections, under the watchful\neye of a corporal who meted out punishments for the tiniest scuff on a boot, a\nbelt, or a rifle. The rest of the time was spent in physical training, which I found\nespecially hard, at least at the beginning. I still weighed barely 130 pounds, and\nby no means all, or even most, of it was muscle. My military career, such as it\nwas, looked very likely to involve spending my required couple of years baking\ninside an APC in the Negev before moving on to something more useful, and\ncertainly more fulfilling, with the rest of my life.\n\n50\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027898",
