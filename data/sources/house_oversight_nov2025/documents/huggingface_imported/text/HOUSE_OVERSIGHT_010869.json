Is it your testimony, Mr. Cassell, that\ntelling a person that multiple people have identified\nyou as a witness to some activity is fair notice that\nyou, yourself, are accused of engaging in criminal\nmisconduct?\n\nA. So--so you, I think, recharacterized the\nletter that went to Mr. Dershowitz in 2011. The letter,\nas I recall, doesn't say he is a witness. It says, if I\nrecall -- we can double-check the language -~ but I\nbelieve the language says: Numerous witnesses have\nplaced you in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein, underaged\ngirls, and Epstein. Then, you know, so at that point,\ngiven what we know in this case, given that at that\npoint in 2011, there had been an ongoing set of\nallegations against Mr. Epstein, I -- I think your\nquestion doesn't -- doesn't take into account this\nsurrounding context.\n\nNot to mention the fact there had been a 2009\ndeposition request and a 2013 document request.\n\nQ. Okay.

Numerous\nwitnesses have placed you in the presence of sex\noffend -- at that point, convicted sex offender Jeffrey\nEpstein, who was convicted of sexually abusing underaged\ngirls, and underaged girls, and those are the subjects\nwe would like to question you about.\n\nAnd rather than getting a response that says,\nwell, let me clear that all up, the response that's\nreceived was, something along the lines of, give me more\ninformation and -- and, quote: I'll decide whether I\nwant to cooperate, close quote, or something along those\nlines.\n\nQ.
