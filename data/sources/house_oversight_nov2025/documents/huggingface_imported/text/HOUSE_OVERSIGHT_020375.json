The first system he divulged, and the one which though it received the most\npublic attention, did the least damage, was what the NSA called the 215 program because it had\nbeen authorized by section 215 of the Patriot Act of 2001. This program amassed, the billing\nrecords of every phone call made in America that could be used as a data base by the FBI. The\nidea was that when any foreigner on the FBI’s watch list of terrorists called anyone in the U.S. the\nFBI could trace that person’s entire chain of telephone contacts to try to determine if he was\nconnected to a terrorist cell. There was, however, a major flaw in this program: it did not cover e-\nmail and other Internet messaging, which 2013 had largely replaced telephone calls. In addition,\nterrorist organizations had become fully aware of the vulnerability of telephoning overseas. So\nalthough the NSA could cite a handful of early successes that “215” yielded, Snowden’s exposure\nof it did only limited damage/\n\nBut Snowden did not stop with “215.” He next did vastly more damage by exposing the\nPRISM program also called “702” since it was authorized in 2007 by section 702 of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act.) Since a large part of the fiber cables on which the world’s\nInternet runs pass through the United States, the NSA was able to intercept 91 percent of its\ndata, including Google searches, social media postings, Skype conversations, messages on Xbox\nLive, Instant messaging services, tweets on Twitter and e-mails. The CIA and FBI could then\ntrack the movements of foreign terrorists. Up until June 6, 2014, terrorist groups presumably\nwere unaware of the NSA’s capacity to vacuum in even encrypted parts of the Internet since they\nused it for their lethal planning. This ignorance gave U.S intelligence an important edge in pre-\nempting terrorist actions. According to the testimony of General Alexander, data intercepted\nunder PRISM helped detect and thwart no fewer than 45 terrorist attacks prior to Snowden’s\nmaking this capability known.\n\nThe third NSA program of interest to Jihadists that Snowden revealed was called XKeyscore.\nUsing Internet data from PRISM, it created the equivalent of digital fingerprints for suspected\nforeign terrorists based on their search patterns on the Internet. This made it difficult for a\nterrorist suspect to hide on the Internet. He might attempt to evade surveillance by using a\ndifferent computer and another name but, unknown to him, the XKeyscore algorithms would\ncontinue to track him under his new alias.\n\nTo even further enable furtive Internet users evade surveillance, Snowden provided in an\ninterview specific data about the secret sources and methods used both the NSA and British\nGCHQ. He revealed, for example that the GCHQ had deployed the first \"full-take\" Internet\ninterceptor that “snarfs everything, in a rolling buffer to allow retroactive investigation without\nmissing a single bit.” When asked how to circumvent it, he replied: “you should never route\nthrough or peer with the UK under any circumstances. Their fibers are radioactive, and even the\nQueen's selfies to the pool boy get logged.” Aside from this warning about using Internet\nproviders whose wiring passes through Britain, he also warned Internet users against using the\nservices of American Internet companies since the NSA considered “telecom collaborators to be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020375",
