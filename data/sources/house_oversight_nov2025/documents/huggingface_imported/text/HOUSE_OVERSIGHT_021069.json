  "text": "Federal Debt Held by the Public vs. Gross Debt\n\ne Federal Debt Held by the Public ($9 Trillion Outstanding, 62% of GDP in 2010)\n- Value of all federal securities sold to the public that are still outstanding.\n\n- Represents the cumulative effect of past federal borrowing on today’s economy and on the\ncurrent federal budget.\n\n- Net interest payments represent a burden on current taxpayers.\n\ne Gross Debt ($14 Trillion Outstanding, 94% of GDP in 2010)\n\n- Public debt + intragovernmental debt (related to entities including the Social Security Trust\nFund and federal employee / veterans’ pension fund) + net liability of GSEs (related to likes\nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).\n\n- Represents a claim on both current and future resources.\n\ne We Focus on Public Debt Levels\n- Public debt is the base for calculating net interest payments.\n\n- Gross debt level could be misleading (to take an extreme example, simply eliminating all\ntrust funds without changing promised benefits for the associated programs would\ndramatically reduce gross debt from 94% of GDP to 62% of GDP without improving long-\nterm fiscal outlook at all*).\n\n- In the future, when intragovernmental debt + net liability of GSEs begin demanding\nrepayments, it is likely financed via material increases in public debt levels.\n\nNote: *for more details, see James R.
