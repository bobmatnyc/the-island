  "text": "organizations are not run, for better or worse, by MBAs, but by young people\ndistinguished only by their earnestness and public sector idealism and ambition. (It is an\nanomaly of Republican politics that young people motivated to work in the public sector\nfind themselves working to limit the public sector.) Careers advance by how well you\nlearn on the job and how well you get along with the rest of the swamp and play its game.\n\nIn 2008, Walsh became the McCain campaign’s midwest regional finance director—\nhaving majored in marketing and finance at GW, she was trusted to hold the checkbook.\nThen on to deputy finance director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,\ndeputy finance director and then finance director of the Republican National Committee,\nand finally, pre-White House, chief of staff of the RNC and its chairman, Reince Priebus.\n\nIn retrospect, the key moment in saving the Trump campaign might be less the Mercer-\nled takeover and imposition of Bannon and Conway in mid-August than the acceptance\nthat the bare-bones and still largely one-man organization would need to depend on the\nlargesse of the RNC. The RNC had the ground game and the data infrastructure; other\ncampaigns might not normally trust the national committee, with its many snakes in the\ngrass, but the Trump campaign had chosen not to build this sort of organization or make\nthis investment. In late August, Bannon and Conway, with Kushner’s consent, made a deal\nwith the deep-swamp RNC despite Trump’s continued insistence that they’d gotten this far\nwithout the RNC, so why come crawling now?\n\nAlmost right away Walsh became a key player in the campaign, a dedicated, make-the-\ntrains-run-on-time power centralizer—a figure without which few organizations can run.\nCommuting between RNC headquarters in Washington and Trump Tower, she was the\nquartermaster who made national political resources available to the campaign.\n\nIf Trump himself was often a disruption in the final months of the race and during the\ntransition, the campaign around him, in part because its only option was to smoothly\nintegrate with the RNC, was a vastly more responsive and unified organization than, say,\nthe Hillary Clinton campaign with its significantly greater resources. Facing catastrophe\nand seeming certain humiliation, the Trump campaign pulled together—with Priebus,\nBannon, and Kushner all starring in buddy-movie roles.\n\nThe camaraderie barely survived a few days in the West Wing.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nTo Katie Walsh, it became almost immediately clear that the common purpose of the\ncampaign and the urgency of the transition were lost as soon as the Trump team stepped\ninto the White House. They had gone from managing Donald Trump to the expectation of\nbeing managed by him—or at least through him and almost solely for his purposes. Yet\nthe president, while proposing the most radical departure from governing and policy\nnorms in several generations, had few specific ideas about how to turn his themes and\nvitriol into policy, nor a team that could reasonably unite behind him.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019969",
