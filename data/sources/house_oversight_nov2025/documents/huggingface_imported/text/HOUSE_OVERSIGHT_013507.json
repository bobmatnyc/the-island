Now we’re allowed to know that G-spot stimulation of the\npara-urethral glands in the female can result in spurt as well as a cup that runneth\nover.\n\nOther occasions of the temporal disappearance of the self-conscious |\noccurred while doing the theorem and proof work of high school geometry. Axioms\nand the rule bound processes of deduction created difficult journeys from that which\nwas given to what should be found. Rocking back and forth in a desk chair for\nhours, chewing on fingernails, cuticles and pencil ends, time disappeared in a none\nself aware state of work-a-day well-being. Sri Aurobindo’s Bhagadvad Gita\ndescribed this state as one of the rewards of karma yoga. Abulafia’s Kabalistic\nSchool emphasized the importance of hitbodedut, detachment and seclusion in\nconcentrated thought, as a technique for the attainment of spiritual “intensification.”\nStacks of lined yellow paper piled up full of blind alleys as | lived in humbling\ndumbness. One of my teachers of mathematics described it as the working\nmathematician’s dark night of the soul. A breakthrough to a route from premises to\nproof brought an expansive rush.\n\nEngagement in a struggle to fuse two differing contextual worlds may be\ntransporting. Geometric visions can be used to do imageless algebra in a brain\nstate that feels like intuition. The brain does something like this: Let the number of a\nsequence of unit squares, each side of measuring 0 to 1, be the denominator of a\nseries of fractions, say fifths. Now put five of these boxes in a row. Then the\nsequence of all possible fifths, 0/5,1/5, 2/5,..5/5, is inscribed by cutting the vertical\nsides of the five sequential squares with a diagonal from the lower left of the first\none to the upper right corner of the last. This line cuts each sequential square’s\nfront boundary with vertical lengths, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4...1.0 in a series of decimal\nfractions equivalent to the sequence of all possible fifths, the proper fractions 1/5,\n2/5...5/5. It was Abulafia’s kabalistic belief that symbolic, (algebraic), operations in\n(geometric) spaces can unify the “upper” and “lower” worlds in the eternal tensions\nbetween the body and soul, the inner world and the cosmos, the conflict making the\n\nglobal system both sensitive and stable.
