  "text": "aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public\n\norder. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 15-month\ninvestigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by a state grand jury\non a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution.\n\nDuring that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met\nface-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility -- or lack thereof -- and considered\nthe extent of exculpatory evidence. Then, after months of elaborate negotiations, the state prosecutors believed\nthey had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely\nconsistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants.\n\nThen, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. Epstein's situation into\nits vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long\nlast, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the\nstate. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the\nfederal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due\nprocess. For example, the agreement required Mr. Epstein to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims\n$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that Jeffrey pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified\nvictims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported\nthis extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from Alaska\ninvolving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges.\n\nUnder the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the\nagreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. Jeffrey complied,\nserved that sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated\n\nindividuals. His conduct was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. He continued\nhis work, including his many philanthropic efforts.\n\nOur friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He has also paid out millions of dollars to the asserted\nvictims and their highly-creative lawyers. For over ten years, he has lived an exemplary life, including\ncarrying on his wide-ranging philanthropies. Those of us who represented him in the Florida proceedings -- for\ncustomary professional fees -- now count him as a trusted friend.\n\nOur nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human\ndignity. Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the\n\nworkplace. But Jeffrey, an exemplary employer, has long since been called to account by the criminal justice\nsystem for his misdeeds of yesteryear. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances, that\nunhappy chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-magnificent life should be allowed to close once and for all.\n\nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2018 at 4:24 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\nken ,would take a stab at the article for the law journal. ? thx\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
