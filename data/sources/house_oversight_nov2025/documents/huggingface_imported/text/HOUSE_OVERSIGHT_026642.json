  "text": "does not imply that there will be a demise of the dollar, or that fewer people\nin the world would speak English in protest. If anything, I’m worried that a\nsharp rally in the dollar could trigger another financial crisis in EM... Don’t\nget me wrong, I do not believe the dominance of the dollar is good for the\nglobal financial/monetary system. But it is a trend that is difficult to reverse,\nunless the structural integrity of the EUR is enhanced, and the foundations of\nthe RMB market are improved. Increasing returns to scale have made\nEnglish/dollar popular, and it will be increasingly difficult to challenge their\nroles as the world internationalizes. (5) The BIS recently published an\ninteresting and important paper (‘The Dollar, Bank Leverage and the\nDeviation from Covered Interest Parity,’ by H.S. Shin et al., BIS WP 592)\non how a stronger dollar could lead to a tightening in lending conditions in\nthe rest of the world, including EM. ‘/7/he value of the dollar plays the role\nof a barometer of risk-taking capacity in capital markets. In particular, it is\nthe spot exchange rate of the dollar which plays a crucial role... [T]he\nstrength of the dollar is a key determinant of bank leverage... Our results\npoint to the financial channel of exchange rates, through which fluctuations\nin the strength of the dollar set in motion changes in capital market\nintermediation spreads that respond at a high frequency... [I]t is when the\ndomestic currency appreciates, financial conditions in that country loosen,\nand CIP deviations narrow... [A] strengthening of US dollar has adverse\nimpacts on bank balance sheets, which, in turn, reduces banks’ risk bearing\ncapacity.’ The findings of this paper are consistent with two of the points\nmade above, that we may re-enter a phase that is not that positive for EM\ncurrencies and that the dominance of the dollar as an international currency\nis having unintended consequences for the rest of the world, out of line with\nthe local fundamentals.\n\nTrump and Europe. Political and social pressures have returned to Europe,\nand could continue to accentuate the centrifugal forces in the region. There\nare many risk events on the horizon, including the Austrian Presidential\nelection on December 4 (the worry here is a victory for Mr Norbert Hofer of\nthe far right party), the Italian referendum on Constitutional reform on\nDecember 4 (while a ‘no’ outcome is largely priced-in, an actual ‘no’\noutcome may trigger a series of events in Italy that might pose some\ndownside risks to Italian banks and in turn other European banks), the Dutch\nparliamentary election on March 15, 2017 (the worry here is further\nadvances by the far right party led by Geert Wilders), the first round of the\nFrench presidential election on April 23 and the second round on May 7, UK\nlocal elections on May 4 (this will be the first major electoral test for PM\nMay), and finally German regional elections on May 7 and 14 and the\nparliamentary election in September. (1) I don’t think the direction of\ncausality runs from Trump to Europe, but that the underlying forces\npropelling both Brexit and Trump are the same forces that are pushing the\npolitical centre of mass to the right in Europe. This direction of causality is\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026642",
