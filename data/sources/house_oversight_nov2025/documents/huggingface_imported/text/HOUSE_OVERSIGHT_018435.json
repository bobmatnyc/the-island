  "text": "There is a lesson for us here, one that redounds onto Plato’s political question and\nour own: Who should rule? We feel overwhelmed by our age. So much to master:\nFighting wars. Complex politics. Radically changing economics. New technologies\nreplacing old ones before we can understand them. The mastery of each of these will\nnot be achieved by dashing success in each. So we need to cultivate a single,\nessential instinct here. Anew temprament that I’ve called The Seventh Sense. And,\nwith that done, to fight the wars, write the poems, make the civilizations to confront\nall that lies ahead. Our greatest hope in the race against the totalizing machines and\nthose who control them; our finest insurance for liberty and prosperity instead of\nmadness is not in technology. Our greatest weapon will not be our bombers our\ndrones or our financial strength. It will be in our own humanity. We have to accept\nthat we are going to be gated in all the ways we've seen: By speed, by Al, by the New\nCaste. We'll be torn apart by those new network dynamics, and placed on topologies\nwe can hardly understand. Our future fight is not about if we are going to be\nenmeshed or not. It is about the terms of that enmeshment - and it is here that the\ngreat questions of politics will be decided. And where the protection of the things\nyou love and care about will be braced against the crashing of an old order.\n\n5.\n\nEverything ahead of us will be political. We’ve established already: Connection\nchanges the nature of an object. What’s true for a phone or a medical device, a\nweapon or an currency is true too for a vote. Or a citizen. The nature, the essence of\nan object changes as a result of connectivity. It takes that old Platonic notion of an\n“ideal” state and stretches it beyond what we're fully capable of understanding. Our\npuzzle is that while “we are what we are connected to,” it is also true that we don’t\nfully know or understand just what those links are yet. At certain moments it seems\nwe're linked to something miraculous, at others to a system of really instant\nviciousness. And because we are all connected, changes in one part of the system\ninvariably redound elsewhere. An object seems miraculous one moment, violent the\nnext. This isn’t getting easier for us. We are, as we've seen, heading to an era where\nthe machines and the networks will have ever more, ever more decisive power,\nlargely because we've given it to them. We’d be wise to consider the lesson of\nhistory here: Structures snap when bent by forces for which they are not prepared.\n\nThose fast, hammering centuries that ran from the reformation to the scientific\nrevolution to the enlightenment to the industrial revolution were like this. The\nredistribution of power and finance into the hands of the many demanded the\ndemolition of old structures, the ones mastered by a few. For one man to rule\nmillions with no reason other than birth made no sense anymore. The last six\ncenturies have been nothing but a tale of liberation, its price and its rewards. We are\nmore free now than we ever have been, in a sense. And, at this very same moment,\nwe are more enmeshed. Power is moving now from institutions and ideas built for\nliberty to ones built for enclosure, for connection, for speed and for the beyond-\nhuman intelligence that complexity demands. This will snap our votes, our money\nand our ideas with the same blunt efficiency the last revolution managed in Luther’s\n\n203\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018435",
