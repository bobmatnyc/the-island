The most successful serial vagabonds tend to blend the mental and the physical. Notice\nthat I often transport a skill I practice domestically —martial arts—to other countries where they are also\npracticed. Instant social life and camaraderie. It need not be a competitive sport—it could be hiking,\nchess, or almost anything that keeps your nose out of a textbook and you out of your apartment. Sports\njust happen to be excellent for avoiding foreign-language stage fright and developing lasting friendships\nwhile still sounding like Tarzan.\n\nLanguage learning deserves special mention. It is, bar none, the best thing you can do to hone clear\nthinking.\n\nQuite aside from the fact that it is impossible to understand a culture without understanding its\nlanguage, acquiring a new language makes you aware of your own language: your own thoughts. The\nbenefits of becoming fluent in a foreign tongue are as underestimated as the difficulty is overestimated.\nThousands of theoretical linguists will disagree, but I know from research and personal experimentation\nwith more than a dozen languages that (1) adults can learn languages much faster than children®? when\nconstant 9-5 work is removed and that (2) it is possible to become conversationally fluent in any\nlanguage in six months or less. At four hours per day, six months can be whittled down to less than three\nmonths. It is beyond the scope of this book to explain applied linguistics and the 80/20 of language\nlearning, but resources and complete how-to guides can be found under “language” at\nwww.fourhourblog.com. I learned six languages after failing Spanish in high school, and you can do the\nsame with the right tools.\n\nGain a language and you gain a second lens through which to question and understand the world.\nCursing at people when you go home is fun, too.\n\nDon’t miss the chance to double your life experience.\n\nService for the Right Reasons: To Save the Whales, or Kill Them\nand Feed the Children?\n\nMorality is simply the attitude we adopt toward people we personally dislike.\n— OSCAR WILDE\n\nO,. would expect me to mention service in this chapter, and here it is. Like all before it, the twist is\n\na bit different. Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own. This is not\nthe same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind—human\nlife. Human life has long been focused on the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food\nchain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for\nthe betterment and multiplication of mankind.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013984",
