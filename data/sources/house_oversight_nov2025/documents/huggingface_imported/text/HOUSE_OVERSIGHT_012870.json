  "text": "concluded that criminals were born not made. Their defining features were throwbacks to our\nevolutionary ancestors, dehumanized by biological defects. Modern man was civilized and elegant.\nCriminal man was barbaric, a savage with slanted forehead, jutting jaw, and excessively long arms.\nCriminal man was more ape-like than human-like. Because the cause of these differences was biological,\nLombroso argued that a life of crime was inevitable. Change through rehabilitation was hopeless. To\nprotect society, these natural born criminals had to be taken out of society, either locked up or executed.\nThese ideas formed the basis of several eugenics’ movements, with the aim of weeding out the\nundesirable, less than human elements of society, be they less intelligent, from a non-Caucasian racial\ngroup, or from a culture with different religious beliefs.\n\nLombroso’s theory of criminality was soon rejected as scholars from a variety of different\ndisciplines unearthed its racial stereotypes and shoddy methods, including a failure to include the many\npeople with slanted foreheads, jutting jaws, and long arms who never committed crimes, and those with\nstatuesque anatomy who did. This initiated a general skepticism and even fear of biological explanations,\ncausing a swing in the opposite direction. Criminals were not born but made by corrupt societies.\nHumans are not born with biologically encoded scripts for behaving with malice or virtue. Rather, we are\nborn with blank slates, waiting for society to inscribe its distinctive signature. So began a pendulous\nswing from nature to nurture. Though the oscillation continues to this day, there is increasing\nappreciation, perhaps especially in the arena of criminology, that both nature and nurture make important\ncontributions. This change comes, in part, from a far greater understanding of genetics, combined with\nlong term studies of how humans and other animals develop within environments that are either nurturing\nor damaging.\n\nConsider the MAOA gene that I mentioned in the last section. This gene produces an enzyme that\ngoes by the same shorthand of MAOA, or MonoAmine Oxidase A. MAOA is evolutionarily ancient,\nshared with other animals, and has two different forms — /ow and high — that influence the level of\nserotonin as well as the brain areas involved in social evaluation and emotional regulation. Early\nevidence for the critical role of this gene in social behavior emerged from a study that knocked it out of\noperation. Ifyou knock out the MAOA gene in mice, they quickly become hyper-hyper-aggressive.\nThese genetically transformed mice have no capacity to regulate their social behavior. Consequently, all\ninteractions are treated as confrontational and handled by aggressive attacks. These results are consistent\nwith a large body of work in animals showing that heightened aggression and low levels of serotonin go\nhand in hand. These results are also consistent with work on humans. In, 1993, the Dutch biologist Hans\nBrunner analyzed the genetics of a large, extended family. Some individuals within this family were born\nwith a defect that silenced the operation of the MAOA gene; they were like the mice who had this gene\n\nsilenced. Relative to others in the family, these individuals had a pronounced history of violence,\n\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 124\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012870",
