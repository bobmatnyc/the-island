  "text": "On Monday morning, Kellyanne Conway appeared on MSNBC and offered a firm\ndefense of the National Security Advisor. “Yes,” she said, “General Flynn does enjoy the\nfull confidence of the president.” And while this seemed to many an indication that\nConway was out of the loop, it was more accurately an indication that she had been\ntalking directly to the president.\n\nA White House meeting that morning failed to convince Trump to fire Flynn. He was\nconcerned about what it would look like to lose his National Security Advisor after just\ntwenty-four days. And he was adamant about not wanting to blame Flynn for talking to\nthe Russians, even about sanctions. In Trump’s view, condemning his adviser would\nconnect him to a plot where there was no plot. His fury wasn’t directed toward Flynn but\nto the “incidental” wiretap that had surveilled him. Making clear his confidence in his\nadviser, Trump insisted that Flynn come to Monday’s lunch with the Canadian prime\nminister, Justin Trudeau.\n\nLunch was followed by another meeting about the furor. There were yet more details of\nthe phone call and a growing itemization of the money Flynn had been paid by various\nRussian entities; there was also increasing focus on the theory that the leaks from the intel\ncommunity—that is, the whole Russia mess—was directed at Flynn. Finally, there was a\nnew rationale that Flynn should be fired not because of his Russian contacts, but because\nhe had lied about them to the vice president. This was a convenient invention of a chain of\ncommand: in fact, Flynn did not report to Vice President Pence, and he was arguably a\ngood deal more powerful than Pence.\n\nThe new rationale appealed to Trump, and he at last agreed that Flynn had to go.\n\nStill, the president did not waiver in his belief in Flynn. Rather, Flynn’s enemies were\nhis enemies. And Russia was a gun to his head. He might, however ruefully, have had to\nfire Flynn, but Flynn was still his guy.\n\nFlynn, ejected from the White House, had become the first established direct link\nbetween Trump and Russia. And depending on what he might say to whom, he was now\npotentially the most powerful person in Washington.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019965",
