  "text": "DA's office ‘went easy’ on sex offender Epstein\n\nBy Rebecca Rosenberg and Danika Fears January 7, 2015 | 2:38am\n\nJeffrey Epstein\nGregory P. Mango\n\nJeffrey Epstein may be a convicted pedophile and accused sex- slave master — but that didn’t stop him from getting some tender loving\ntreatment from the Manhattan DA's Office.\n\nProsectors went to bat for the billionaire pervert at a 2011 legal hearing, asking a judge to cut the filthy- rich felon a break on the severity of\nhis sex- offender status, according to court documents.\n\nADA Jennifer Gaffney supported a request by Epstein — who allegedly peddled $15,000-a-night teen “sex slaves” to rich men like Britain’s\nPrince Andrew — that he only be listed as a Level 1 pervert during a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court, according to legal transcripts.\n\nThe sicko investment magnate has just finished serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence in Florida for soliciting a minor girl for\nprostitution. The hearing was to determine what kind of offender status he would have in New York, where he keeps a vacation home.\n\nThe city ADA argued that since “there was only an indictment for one victim,” Epstein shouldn’t have to register as Level 3 — which would\nrequire he travel to New York every 90 days and check in with cops.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016459",
