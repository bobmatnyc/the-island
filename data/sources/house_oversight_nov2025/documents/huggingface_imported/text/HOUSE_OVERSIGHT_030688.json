Have to keep reminding people that I am actually quite unpopular.\nApparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60 Minutes\nproducer and a friend of Bannon's, came with a message from SB: \"You own me a few million.\" Rosen also\nsays he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and public break with Trump. I can't get\ntogether today because I have to leave for DC at 11AM to speak to 800 book buyers (not to mention pre-signing\n800 books). Then tomorrow AM to LA to do Bill Maher show. Making money is hard work.\n\nOn Thu, Jan 18, 2018 at 7:38 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nhow was it.? why dont you stop by today so we can script tomorrow. - assuming no change. . prefer no\n\ndetails on email\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
