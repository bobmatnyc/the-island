  "text": "have been filed by any of his accusers” — although many have tried to serve him including\nlawyers representing Epstein’s victims, Brunel continues to hide behind his French citizenship to\nprevent depositions. “Trawling for 5’11” underage teenagers to work for his agency, MC2, or\nanyone else who requests, Brunel is free to scout for very young girls without limitations.” Given\nhis citizenship he also successfully avoided deposition in Epstein’s sex related cases.\n\nLike so many other reporters who have tried to report his side of the story when Jezebel\ncontacted Brunel, “he did not respond to our interview request.” According to Jezebel:\n\nwe spoke to a number of people who worked with his agency and while MC2 isn’t considered a\nmajor industry player, it isn’t exactly bottom-shelf, either... Brunel isn’t involved with the\nbusiness on a day-to-day basis, although he owns an 85 percent stake in MC2. Instead, he does\nscouting for the agency and takes care of the international relations with other agencies, reports\none source. Scouts scour the world for unrepresented teenage girls who could make it as models.\nThey work largely unsupervised and are generally paid a headhunting fee for every girl an\nagency signs. Even when affiliated with an agency, as Brunel obviously is with MC2, scouts\noperate mostly independently and with little oversight. The company blog refers to Brunel as a\n‘scouting tsunami’ and MC2 is fairly well known for the strength of its international scouting.\n\nModel, Michael Gross’s 1995 book, describes Brunel’s activities in Paris from the late 1970s\nonwards, when he worked for, and eventually owned, the modeling agency Karin. “Jean-Luc is\nconsidered a danger,” says Jér6me Bonnouvrier. “Owning Karin was a dream for a playboy. His\nproblem is that he knows exactly what girls in trouble are looking for. He’s always been on the\nedge of the system.”\n\nJohn Casablancas, founder of Elite modeling agency said:\n\nI really despise Jean-Luc as a human being for the way he’s cheapened the business. There is no\njustice. This is a guy who should be behind bars. There was a little group, Jean-Luc, Patrick\nGilles, and Varsano. They were very well known in Paris for roaming the clubs. They would\ninvite girls and put drugs in their drinks. Everybody knew they were creeps.” Casablancas was a\nprofessional rival who was pushed out of his agency for questionable concerns.\n\nKatie Ford human trafficking abolitionist and Eileen Ford’s daughter, talked to the Wall Street\nJournalmagazine. In that story “A Model Trade Union,” Ford describes herself as a “roving\nambassador” to help stop human trafficking. Ford sold her stake in the family business in 2007 to\nthe private equity firm Stone Tower Equity. “In her new life as a nearly full-time, unpaid, roving\nambassador for the cause her job is an outgrowth of her former work, rather than a repudiation of\nit, or an atonement.\n\nHer interest in human trafficking began when a representative of the United Nations called to ask\nif she would participate in a women’s leadership group that was studying the issue of trafficking.\n“] said, ‘] can’t come talk about it, because I don’t know anything about it!’” Ford recalls. “But I\nwent, and after two hours, I knew why I was there. The way people traffic across borders is\nparallel to the way we recruit models, According to Ford “the target age is 14 to 24, and so it’s\n\n4]\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011952",
