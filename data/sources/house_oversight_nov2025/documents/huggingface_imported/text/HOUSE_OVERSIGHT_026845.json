  "text": "PESSIMISTIC POPULISTS\n\nThe third challenge today is a widespread loss of confidence in the West\nabout its own systems and future potential. Sluggish growth across the\ndeveloped world, stagnant incomes for much of the population, rising\neconomic inequality, political gridlock, and the emergence of populist\ninsurgencies on both sides of the political spectrum have fueled a\nwidespread sense that Western models of governance and economic\nmanagement are floundering.\n\nMany of these problems are real and important. But they are not beyond the\ncapacity of determined leadership to solve, nor do they represent\nfundamental weaknesses of the Western model. So the pessimism strikes us\nas dramatically overdone, like previous bouts of declinism and worry that\nthe West's best days were past. The greatest danger, in fact, is that the\nwidespread pessimism will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Gloomy\nWestern policymakers and publics are more likely to see threats than\nopportunities and to turn away from the world rather than continue to lead\nit successfully.\n\nThis is notable in the rising opposition, for example, to the Trans-Pacific\nPartnership, a major trade deal that would help extend and deepen the\nliberal order across a broad swath of the globe. It is evident in the increasing\nsuspicion of immigrants and refugees and in the growing support for closing\nborders. And it can be seen in the fraying and potential unraveling of\ninternational institutions such as the European Union, formerly a model of\nprogressive international integration.\n\nIt would be a terrible shame if the West walked away from the very\ninternational order that it created after World War II and that has facilitated\nso much security, prosperity, and development over the decades. Instead, it\nshould try to reinvigorate that order, with three moves in particular:\nworking with China and India, bolstering international rules, and\naccentuating the positive global trends that get lost in all the hysteria about\nthe negative ones.\n\nWhy China and India? Because they have the largest populations and\neconomies in the developing world, are led by strong, reform-minded\nleaders, and are approaching the future with dynamism, optimism, and\nhope. Both understand that they need to take on greater responsibilities in\nconfronting global problems, and as last fall's Paris climate agreement\ndemonstrates, they are already starting to do so.\n\nAlthough China's rise has been one of the universally acknowledged\nwonders of the age, India's recent rise has been impressive as well, as India,\ntoo, has embraced modernization, globalization, and Enlightenment\nrationalism. Along the way, India has maintained the world's largest\ndemocracy, successfully accommodated an amazingly diverse cultural and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026845",
