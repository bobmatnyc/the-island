  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nThe brothers had never had a “home father.” They referred to Gary as their “prison father,” since\nhe had spent most of his adult life behind bars, having been convicted of armed robbery and other\npredatory crimes.\n\nOn the way back to prison from a court appearance, Gary had overpowered the guard, killed him,\ntook his gun and escaped. He was soon recaptured, sentenced to life imprisonment and soon\nbegan to plan his next escape—this time across the border to Mexico, which was only a two hour\ndrive from the prison.\n\nBefore he could escape, Gary had to get himself removed from the “escape risk” list and\nmaximum security—to establish a sense of trust in him by the prison officials. When some young\nprisoners acted up, Gary worked with the prison officials and helped to control them. He worked\non the newspaper, television, and entertainment committee, earning him the right to have visits\nwith his family in the outdoor recreation area. Gary used his time with his family to persuade\nthem to help him escape. After much prodding, the boys agreed.\n\nOn a summer visiting day in July of 1978, the three Tison brothers arrived at the Florence State\nPrison with their perennial picnic basket. Beneath the fried chicken were pistols and shotguns.\n\nThe boys had arranged for a car to be parked in the lot of the local hospital. They knew there\ncould be shooting. But Gary promised them that nobody would get hurt. “The more firepower\nyou have,” he instructed them, “the less likely you’ll have to use it.”\n\n“We told Dad,” Raymond later said, “we’ll do this on one condition—that no one gets hurt.”\n\nGary assured the boys, “We'll make it out without firing a shot or being fired at. And once\noutside, it will be clear sailing. I know how it works. I’ve been there before.” He had been there\nbefore, but it hadn’t worked. He had killed a guard and been recaptured.\n\nTo the three boys, their father wasn’t a killer. A guard had been accidentally shot in a scuffle. It\nwas not in cold blood. Their father was incapable of that. Gary told them that his criminal\nconduct had been a result of secret training he had received in the “Service.” It was “top secret.”\nThey believed this fantasy like they believed everything else their father told them. “Nobody was\ngoing to get shot,” their father assured them.\n\nGary’s prediction proved to be correct about the escape. Raymond went to meet his father in the\npicnic area. His brothers Ricky and Donny went into the waiting room with their picnic basket.\nA friend of Gary’s, Randy Greenawalt—also a convicted murderer—was in an adjoining control\nroom. When the other visitors had left, the boys pulled out their shotguns and held the guards at\nbay. Raymond and Gary joined them.\n\nWhen additional guards appeared they were first ordered to lie down and then herded into a\nstorage room. The door was locked and the power turned off. Then the five simply walked out\nthe front door. Not a shot had been fired.\n\n166\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017253",
