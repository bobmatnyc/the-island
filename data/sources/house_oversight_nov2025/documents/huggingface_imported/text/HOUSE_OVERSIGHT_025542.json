  "text": "secret; no names on their list would be disclosed to my attorneys or myself until I\nwas already firmly in a jail cell. A list that we would not only be obliged to pay\nmoney to, but if any of the women did not accept the $50,000, I would be required to\npay an attorney, chosen by the government, to represent the women to enable them\nto sue me; I would have to pay their attorney fees. I would be given the names of the\nwomen after being in jail, would not be allowed to appeal this deal, pay women,\nsome of whom I had never even met, and if I chose to fight this deal, I would be\nthreatened over and over with being in breach of my agreement. The attorney\nchosen by the government to represent these women hired his own daughter, a\nsitting state prosecutor, who received special leave to represent these women, and\nthough she continued to receive her state salary, billed me over $800,000 ina\nperiod of one year to represent women suing me. When my side raised objections,\nwe were told that if we fought this, the government would declare a breach of my\nagreement and indict me. The AUSA actually filed an affidavit with the court that\nstated that “The protection from the government that Epstein thought he bargained\nfor really is “illusory”, we can always bring a case against him for the live span of any\nwoman we think has been a victim.”\n\nAfter serving my sentence, I was sued by many women on the government list.\nDuring many of the depositions taken in those cases, the women admitted to the\nfollowing: they had many other clients, they got paid thousands of dollars a week to\nwork in the local massage parlors and sex clubs, they kept their list of johns in their\nBible. Many had abusive boyfriends and abortions way before they ever met me,\nthough they claimed sex assault abuse and various other sex claims. Most later\nbrought their best friends to the house who also claimed the same abuse in the\nhopes of getting money.\n\nWith what the newspapers had called a dream team, each and every lawyer, when\nthey saw the result of the negotiations, said with incredulity, “We have never seen\nanything like this before”. I had never left my house and the women had not traveled\non my planes or to another state. I had never made money off of these women. I was\na consumer of prostitution, a john. The government said that they could invoke a\nstatute for travel for the purpose of sex, which would be the equivalent to tourists\nwho sign on to fake web sites advertising sex with minors in Cambodia, Thailand\nand other third world countries. The government said that they could charge me\nwith traveling to Florida to have sex with an underage girl, even though sex with 16\nyear olds is legal in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and sex with 17 year olds is legal\nin New York. They suggested that they would indict me for traveling to Florida FOR\nTHE PURPOSE of having sex with minors. Not withstanding the fact that I hada\nhome in Florida for 15 years, regularly traveled to see my brother, mother and\nbusiness associates. They said that they thought a novel application could at least\nget me indicted, unless I took the state plea deal. I had little choice. The crimes they\nalleged, no matter what the likelihood of success, carried with them a minimum\nmandatory 10-year sentence. I recognize that am not a sympathetic figure, and\nhad to decide whether to risk a trial where the jury would see an older man and\nyoung women that would be paraded in Sunday school outfits during the trial.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025542",
