The\n\n_ medical records, he said,\ncan’t be sought until the\nwomen are asked whether\nthey have ever had an\n\nabortion, how many and’\n\nwhere. Further, he said,\nthe records .would not be\n\n-~| Epstein .\n“1 The judge says\nej the records\n+ would not be\n\nmade public.\n\nmade public and might not\nbe admissible during trial.\n\nBut, he said, since the\nwomen claim Epstein,\nnow 57, is responsible for\n\n. their emotional’ distress,\n\nhis attorneys can explore\nthe impact of other events.\nMedical records, Hafele\nsaid, are a better source\nof information than a\nperson's memory.\n\nAttorney Louis Silver,\nwho represents the Presi-\ndential Women’s Health\nCenter, a West Palm Beach\nclinic where abortions are\nperformed, warned Hafele\nthat he was stepping\non shaky constitutional\ngrounds,\n\n“These records are\nprotected by our consti-\ntutional right of privacy,”\nhe said, referring’ to the\nFlorida Constitution.\n\nAfter the. hearing, Sil-\nver said an appeal won’t be\nnecessary until Epstein at-\n\ntorneys seek the records.\n\nIn another ruling\nWednesday, Hafele also\nsaid that videos from\ndepositions in the state\ncases can't be released\nwithout a court order. The\nruling came after Epstein\n\nattorney Robert Critton.\n\ncomplained that a. video\nof Epstein being asked\nwhether he had an “egg-\nshaped” penis became a\nyoutube.com sensation. It\nfirst appeared on The Palm\nBeach Post Web site.\nCritton blamed attorney\nSpencer Kuvin for releas-\ning it. Kuvin said it was\n\n“public record.\n\nThe civil suits began\nmounting after Epstein\nagreed to plead guilty to\ntwo state charges: procur-\ning aminor for prostitution\nand soliciting prostitution.\nHe served 13 months of\nan 18-month sentence. As\npart of the deal brokered\nwith federal prosecutors,\nhe agreed not to contest\n\nthe accusations.in the civil '\n\nlawsuits. He can argue the\nwomen don’t deserve the\nmillions they are seeking.\n@jane_musgrave@pbpost.com\n|\n\nVEMM-/ OSD pa uP\n\n(Indicate page, name of\nnewspaper, city and state.)\n\nDate:\n\nTite: Judge yules Epsteir\nAttoy pays Caw Sub pornr Abot ti\ntéo/d\n\nCharacter:\n\nor\n\nClassification:\nSubmitting Office:\n\n(32/0\nu Bench POST\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021664 |\n\n$\n3/E-MM JOP06 Q-",
