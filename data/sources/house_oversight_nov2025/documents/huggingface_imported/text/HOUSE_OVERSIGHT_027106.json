And yet Iran also chose to convert some of its stockpile of\nhighly enriched uranium for medical use rather than approach the amount\nneeded for a bomb, leading Israeli authorities to predict that Iran wouldn't\nbe able to build a bomb before 2015 or 2016. Last week, Ali Akbar\nVelayati, Khamenei's foreign policy advisor, publicly criticized officials\nwho have treated the negotiations dismissively. Presumably, he was\nthinking of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has compared Iran's\nnuclear program to a train without brakes.\n\nIran is now at the outset of what promises to be a raucous presidential\nelection, and may be no more capable of serious negotiations between now\nand June than the United States was in 2012. But what is clear is that the\nsanctions have moderated Iranian behavior and rhetoric. At the same time,\nas the Times also noted, the economic pressure is not nearly great enough\nto compel concessions that the regime would view as a blow to national\npride. In short, Iran might -- might -- be more willing to accept a face-\nsaving compromise than they were a year or two ago, but will need serious\ninducements to do so.\n\nWhat would that entail? Virtually all the proposals that have come from\noutside experts suggest that the P5+1 begin with modest confidence-\nbuilding measures, especially in the period before the election. A recent\nreport by the Arms Control Association enumerates several of them.\nWestern diplomats, for example, could take up Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's\nforeign minister, on his proposal to limit the \"extent\" of enrichment -- 1.e.,\nwell below 20 percent -- in exchange for fuel rods for the research reaction\nand a recognition of Iran's \"right to enrich,\" a notional concept the United\nStates already supports under specified conditions. Or Iran could suspend\n20-percent enrichment in exchange for a suspension of new sanctions. But\nIran is unlikely to accept even such small steps unless it felt that additional\nmoves would win additional explicit concessions.\n\nBeyond that, the outlines of what in Middle East peacemaking is known as\n\"final status\" are clear enough: Iran agrees to verifiable inspections to\nensure that it does not enrich uranium beyond 3.5 percent and does not\npursue a nuclear weapons program, while the West accepts Iran's \"right to\nenrich\" and dismantles sanctions. Of course, the outlines of a Middle East\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027106",
