There is still a long way to go, from\npreschool to an AGI system that is capable of, say, passing the Turing Test or serving as an\neffective artificial scientist.\n\nOur suggestion is to extend the school metaphor further, and make use of existing curricula\nfor higher levels of virtual education: grade school, secondary school, and all levels of post-\nsecondary education. If an AGI can pass online primary and secondary schools such as e-\ntutor.com, and go on to earn an online degree from an accredited university, then clearly said\nAGI has successfully achieved “human level, roughly humanlike AGI.” This sort of testing is\ninteresting not only because it allows assessment of stages intermediate between preschool and\nadult, but also because it tests humanlike intelligence without requiring precise imitation of\nhuman behavior.\n\nIf an AI can get a BA degree at an accredited university, via online coursework (assuming\nfor simplicity courses where no voice interaction is needed), then we should consider that AT to\nhave human-level intelligence. University coursework spans multiple disciplines, and the details\nof the homework assignments and exams are not known in advance, so like a human student\nthe AGI team can’t cheat.\n\nIn addition to the core coursework, a schooling approach also tests basic social interaction\nand natural language communication, ability to do online research, and general problem solving\nability. However, there is no rigid requirement to be strictly humanlike in order to pass university\nclasses.\n\nMost of our concrete examples in the following chapters will pertain to the preschool context,\nbecause it’s simple to understand, and because we feel that getting to the “AGI preschool\nstudent” level is going to be the largest leap. Once that level is obtained, moving further\nwill likely be difficult also, but we suspect it will be more a matter of steady incremental\nimprovements — whereas the achievement of preschool-level functionality will be a large leap\nfrom the current situation.\n\n16.6 Issues with Virtual Preschool Engineering\n\nAs noted above there are two broad approaches to realizing the “AGI Preschool” idea: using\nthe AGI to control a physical robot and then crafting a preschool environment suitable to the\nrobot’s sensors and actuators; or, using the AGI to control a virtual agent in an appropriately\nrich virtual-world preschool. The robotic approach is harder from an AI perspective (as one must\ndeal with problems of sensation and actuation), but easier from an environment-construction\nperspective. In the virtual world case, one quickly runs up against the current limitations\nof virtual world technologies, which have been designed mainly for entertainment or social-\nnetworking purposes, not with the requirements of AGI systems in mind.\n\nIn Chapter 9 we discussed the general requirements that an environment should possess to be\nsupportive of humanlike intelligence. Referring back to that list, it’s clear that current virtual\nworlds are fairly strong on multimodal communication, and fairly weak on naive physics. More\nconcretely, if one wants a virtual world so that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013214",
