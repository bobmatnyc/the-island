There is too great a chance of an\nappearance of impropriety with Babbitt and I received a bad report about Searcy last night.\n\nThank you.\n\nA. Marie Villafatia\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney\n\n500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400\n\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401\n\nFrom: Villafana, Ann Marie C. (USAFLS)\nSent: Tuesday, September 25, 2007 8:37 PM\nTo: ‘Jay Lefkowitz’\n\nSubject: Other attorneys\n\nHi Jay — These four people were recommended. I have not contacted them to find out what their\nrates are. All are very active in the plaintiffs’ bar in the West Palm area. Ted Babbitt would be\n\nmy first choice of these four but I think he is conflicted out because one of his partners is\nmarried to an AUSA here. Stuart Grossman is probably my second choice.\n\nTed Babbitt -- http://www.babbitt-johnson.com/tbabbitt. html\n\nStuart Grossman -- http://www.grossmanandroth.com/sgrossman.htm\nChris Searcy -- h\n\nwww.searcylaw.com/CHRISTIANDSEARC Y/tabid/935/default.aspx\n\nLake Lytal, Jr. -- http://www.lytalreiter.com/index.php?page_id=37\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012625",
