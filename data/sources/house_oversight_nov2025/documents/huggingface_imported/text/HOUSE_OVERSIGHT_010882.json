And -- and -- and background means that it's\nnot for attribution, correct?\n\nA. Right. The background means the reporter can\nuse the information, but shouldn't attribute it to a\nparticular person.\n\nQ. And, in fact, you have --\n\nA. Or let me -- let me just clarify. Some\ntime -- well, background, I think, you know, we are now\ntalking about sort of -- when I use the term\n\"background,\" it would generally mean that this is\nsomething maybe that you want to investigate and see if\nyou can confirm in other ways, but it shouldn't be\nsourced to ~- that I shouldn't be quoted directly\nbecause they are going to have to find other -~ other\nsources that confirm that same information.\n\nQ. Okay. And so my question is that it is true\nthat you have spoken with a number of reporters on\nbackground about Virginia Roberts's allegations in this\ncase, correct?\n\nA. Well, a number -- a few, I would say, is\nprobably a more accurate characterization.\n\nQ.  Andin any of those background conversations,\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n317\ndid you ever identify Miss Roberts as someone who had\nbeen sexually abused by Mr. -- Professor Dershowitz?\n\nA. I tried to identify myself as the attorney\nrepresenting someone who said that she had been sexually\nabused by Dershowitz. I think you've received -- you\nknow, we can go through -- you know, we have produced, I\nthink, 2,500 pages of discovery. Many of those pages\nare media communications. And, you know, we can go\nthrough, and I think you know that there are a number of\nexamples, many examples, where I have said, I represent\na woman who has alleged that... Some verbal formulation\nalong those lines.\n\nI mean, attorneys represent victims all the\ntime and -- and I don't think people generally\nunderstand when an attorney makes a statement, that the\nattorney is adopting and vouching for that statement.\nThey are -- they are serving in a representative\ncapacity.\n\nQ. Have you finished your answer?\n\nA. TI have.\n\nQ. Okay. Do you -- are you a party to any fee\nagreement of any kind that would relate to a possible\nrecavery from Les Wexner?\n\nMS.
