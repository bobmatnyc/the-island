  "text": "18\n\nMohamed Bouazizi and the symbolism of his fate that sparked all the\nrevolutions across the Middle East.\n\nThe images of the rebels in Libya liberating their country (as it seems\nthey are close to doing) and chanting songs of freedom, like their\nEgyptian and Tunisian counterparts before them, will no doubt be\nanother powerful inspiration and morale booster for the Syrian\npeople.\n\nQaddafi’s departure will also make it possible for the international\ncommunity to devote more attention and energy to Syria and come up\nwith more creative and coordinated policies to assist the Syrian\npeople, short of bombing Damascus or sending arms. That all eyes\nare currently on Assad is certainly bad news for the dictator.\n\nYet whatever the international community devises, the Syrian protest\nmovement must do a better job organizing and convincing the world\nthat it is more or less ready to take over once Assad falls. For that, the\nprotesters need to create a truly united and inclusive political front\n(the National Council which the Syrian opposition formed today in\nIstanbul is a good first step, but it remains leaderless and still needs\nto come up with a tangible platform that goes beyond the demands\nfor freedom and regime change).\n\nInterviews with Arab intellectuals and ordinary citizens broadcast on\nsatellite TV channels across the Arab world tell us that many Arabs\nbelieve that the rebels in Libya have made a mistake in asking for\nWestern (“colonial”) military intervention. But the rebels' salvation is\nthat they quickly came together and formed a transitional council,\ngaining world recognition and persuading major powers that the\nalternative to Qaddafi is indeed viable.\n\nRight now, the West, and especially Syria’s neighbors, are concerned\nthat Assad’s departure will lead to chaos and perhaps even sectarian,\ncivil war that could spill over to other parts of the region.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031930",
