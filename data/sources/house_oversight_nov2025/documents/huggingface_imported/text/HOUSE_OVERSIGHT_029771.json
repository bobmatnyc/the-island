  "text": "But it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that:\n\n* Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein’s activities, to see whether there is evidence of child\ntrafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the arrangement\nbetween Epstein and the Department of Justice allowing him to plead guilty to lower-level state crimes.\nTrafficking can carry a 20-year sentence.\n\n¢ The FBI is also investigating Epstein’s friend Jean Luc Brunel, whose MC2 modeling agency appears to have\nbeen a source of girls from overseas who ended up on Epstein’s private jets.\n\nBecause Epstein’s predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, there\nmay well be more evidence to uncover.\n\nUnder the concept of double jeopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges covered by\nhis non-prosecution agreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of incarceration, fund the civil suits of\nnamed victims, and register as a sex offender. The victims who accepted cash settlements in these civil suits\nagreed not to testify against him or speak publicly about the case. However, new evidence developed by the\nDepartment of Justice on other offenses not covered by the agreement, including allegations by additional\nvictims who come forward, could lead to new charges. There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-\ntrafficking law, which was also enacted by the state of Florida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch\nback many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, there may well be more evidence to uncover.\n(Several young women who claim to be Epstein victims have recently contacted a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer, but to\ndate no new civil complaints have been filed.)\n\n* Conchita Sarnoff: The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den\n\n* Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free\n\nThese new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about\nEpstein’s pattern of sexual contact with underage girls, which Palm Beach police began investigating in 2005\nand the U.S. Attorney’s office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. The first article quoted a deposition by then-\nPalm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter, in which he stated that Epstein, a billionaire with many powerful\nfriends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his incarceration. Although federal\ninvestigators at one point produced a draft 53-page indictment against Epstein, he was eventually allowed to\nplead guilty to only two relatively minor state charges and receive a short term of incarceration: 13 months in\nthe county jail, during which he went to the office every day, and one year of community control, during which\nhe traveled frequently to New York and his private island in the Virgin Islands.\n\nThe Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which Epstein apparently received special\nconsideration: As a convicted sex offender, he is required by law to undergo an impartial psychological\nevaluation prior to sentencing and to receive psychiatric treatment during and after incarceration. This is\nbecause child molesters tend to be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According to a source in law\nenforcement, however, Epstein was allowed to submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr. Stephen\nAlexander of Palm Beach, Florida, whose phone has since been disconnected with no forwarding information.\n\nThe Daily Beast’s second article provided details about Epstein’s systematic abuse of underage girls at his\nPalm Beach mansion, where members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers, most of\nthem 16 or younger, to perform daily massages that devolved into masturbation, groping, and sometimes full-\nblown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between Epstein and Jean Luc Brunel, a frequent\nvisitor to whom he gave $1 million around the same time that Brunel was starting his MC2 modeling agency.\nSome of the young girls MC2 recruited from overseas—often from Eastern Europe and South America—are\nknown to have been passengers on Epstein’s private jets.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney General’s Office in Florida says that it is against policy to confirm or deny the existence of\nan investigation. Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyer, Jack Goldberger, says he has no knowledge of an ongoing probe,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029771",
