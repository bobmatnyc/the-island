  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n809\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\ncans would be on board. /d. Finally, the\ncourt reasoned that the “interest of the\nUnited States in preventing and punishing\ninternational terrorism has been a matter\nof worldwide common knowledge for\nyears.” Jd. (citing statutes criminalizing\nterrorist acts). “It logically follows that if\nfederal courts may constitutionally exer-\ncise criminal jurisdiction over such individ-\nuals, the Constitution should be no bar to\nthose same federal courts, in a civil action\n\n. exercising civil im personam jurisdic-\ntion over those same individuals for the\nsame acts.” Id.\n\n[44] The courts in Rein, Daltberti, and\nPugh properly exercised personal jurisdic-\ntion over each of the defendants in those\ncases pursuant to the FSIA, which specifi-\ncally provides that personal jurisdiction ex-\nists where proper service and subject mat-\nter jurisdiction have been established. 28\nU.S.C. § 1830(b); Rein, 995 F.Supp. at\n329-30; Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 52;\nPugh, 290 F.Supp.2d at 58. While the\nFSIA is not the basis for personal jurisdic-\ntion here, jurisdiction based on the ATA or\nRule 4(k)(2) also requires minimum con-\ntacts with the United States. Accordingly,\nPlaintiffs may rely on their “purposefully\ndirected” theory to establish these mini-\nmum contacts. But as existed in Burger\nKing, Calder, and the three terrorism\ncases, Plaintiffs must allege some personal\nor direct involvement by the Defendants in\nthe conduct giving rise to their claims.\nSee, eg. Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 41\n(explaining that defendant Iraq had held\nand tortured plaintiffs and that three of\nfour plaintiffs were released only after\nU.S. officials’ explicit negotiations with\ntheir Iraqi counterparts); Pugh, 290\nF.Supp.2d at 56 (noting that seven individ-\nual Libyan defendants were sued in the\nUnited States after extensive official\nFrench investigation and that these defen-\ndants were deemed to be responsible for\n\nthe bombings in both civil and criminal\nproceedings); see also In re Magnetic Au-\ndiotape, 334 F.3d at 208 (2d (stating a\n“court may exercise personal jurisdiction\nover defendant consistent with due process\nwhen defendant is primary participant in\nintentional wrongdoing—albeit extraterri-\ntorially—expressly directed at forum”)\n(citing Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. at 789-90,\n104 S.Ct. 1482)); Time, Inc. v. Sumpson,\nNo. 02 Civ. 49170MBM), 2003 WL\n23018890, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2003)\n(finding Calder turned on “personal in-\nvolvement of the individual defendants in\nthe particular conduct that gave rise to the\nplaintiffs claim” and granting motion to\ndismiss because plaintiff had not demon-\nstrated that defendant had had any per-\nsonal involvement in the events giving rise\nto the lawsuit). Accordingly, regardless of\nwhether personal jurisdiction is based on\nthe ATA’s nationwide service of process\nprovision or Rule 4(k)@), to satisfy the\nFifth Amendment’s due process require-\nments, Plaintiffs must make a prima facie\nshowing of each Defendant’s personal or\ndirect participation in the conduct giving\nrise to Plaintiffs’ injuries.\n\n3. Mass Torts Theory\n\n[45] In addition to the arguments ar-\nticulated above, the Federal Plaintiffs sub-\nmit that the Court should utilize a modi-\nfied due process standard appropriate for\nmass torts. See, e.g., Federal Prince Turki\nOpp. at 23; Federal Prince Mohammed\nOpp. at 12; SAAR Network Opp. at 12-13.\nCourts in the Eastern District of New\nYork have outlined the modified standard\nin products liability cases as follows: the\nstate’s interests in the litigation replace\ncontacts with the forum as the constitu-\ntional touchstone and the “reasonableness”\ninquiry is replaced with a hardship analy-\nsis. Simon v. Philip Morris, 86 F.Supp.2d\n95, 129 (E.D.N.Y.2000); In ve DES Cases,\n789 F.Supp. 552, 587 (E.D.N.Y.1992). The\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017874",
