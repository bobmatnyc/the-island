  "text": "2D\n\ndisputed city of Kirkuk. The Iraqi army was moving troops to the\narea. Shooting could have broken out were it not for the presence of\nthe U.S. army in the middle.\n\nPeshmerga leaders won't talk directly to their Iraqi counterparts--they\nneed a trusted third party in the room. What will happen next year if\nanother such crisis erupts when U.S. troops are gone?\n\nThe U.S. Embassy has an ambitious plan to deploy some 1,000\ndiplomats backed by 16,000 contractors to maintain a presence there\nand at several consulates around the country. But even if they pull\nthis off--a feat of logistics that would be unprecedented for the State\nDepartment--there will be no replacement for the peacekeeping\nfunction that is performed by our troops.\n\nContractors may be successful in training Iraqi forces but I have my\ndoubts about whether they will be up to the magnitude of the task.\nIraq has no fighter aircraft and no air-control system. It has only some\n70 tanks and no artillery. Its army has almost no experience in\ncombined-arms warfare, having devoted the last eight years, for\nunderstandable reasons, to counterinsurgency operations.\n\nIn other words, Iraq is almost defenseless. That makes it easy prey for\nIran, its historic rival. This doesn't mean that an Iranian invasion is\nlikely. Yet Iranian bullying and influence-peddling is going on all the\ntime, and if Iraq can't defend its borders, Tehran will have an extra\nelement of coercive leverage.\n\nUnder these circumstances, leaving Iraq entirely would be an act of\nfolly. We are still in Kosovo, South Korea and other post-conflict\nzones that are far more stable. We need to be in Iraq too.\n\nWe don't need to keep 50,000 troops there, but a continuing presence\nof 20,000 military personnel, as argued by military analysts Frederick\nand Kimberly Kagan, would seem to be the minimum necessary to\nensure Iraq's continued progress. It would also make possible an Iraqi-\nAmerican alliance that could become one of the linchpins of security\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023511",
