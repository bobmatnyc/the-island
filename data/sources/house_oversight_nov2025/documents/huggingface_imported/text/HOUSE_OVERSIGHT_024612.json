  "text": "21\n\nafter initially downplaying democracy promotion, the administration\nseems to have begun to pursue it with new energy, partly under the\ninfluence of Chinese dissidents and partly, insiders say, because\nofficials are reluctant to be portrayed as China apologists. Whatever\nthe motivation, Beijing is likely to view this combination of external\nand internal pressure as a serious threat.\n\nMeanwhile, if the White House is seriously seeking to contain China\nor, alternatively, to shape a global environment that would make\ncontainment unnecessary, it is hard to imagine how this could be\ndone without precluding any rapprochement between Moscow and\nBeijing. The administration claims the reset with Russia is one of its\nmost significant foreign-policy successes. But there is less here than\nmeets the eye—on both sides. Russian concessions so far have been\nhalfhearted and Russian policies, whether on Iran or Libya, do not\ncoincide with those of America. For its part, the United States\nappears unprepared to address Moscow’s greatest concerns:\nintegration into Europe’s security architecture and reliable assurances\non missile defense.\n\nMore narrowly—but no less problematic for U.S. efforts to have\nbetter relations with Russia than Russia has with China—Obama’s\nteam is risking alienating a large portion of the Russian elite in its\nresponse to corruption and human-rights violations. While the State\nDepartment has made clear its opposition to legislation punishing\nRussian officials allegedly linked to the death of lawyer Sergei\nMagnitsky while in police custody, the administration has decided\npreemptively to deny visas to those it considers implicated in the\ncase. Moscow has stated clearly that this could derail cooperation\nacross the board, including on sanctions against Iran and transit to\nAfghanistan (a deal that becomes even more important as U.S. ties to\nPakistan deteriorate).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024612",
