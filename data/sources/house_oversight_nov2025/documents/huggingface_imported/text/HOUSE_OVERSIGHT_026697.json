  "text": "UK challenges centred on currency, but future role\nas European hub is unclear\n\nWhile the UK has faced short-term challenges over low\n\ninterest rates (relative to the US), the Brexit decision\nposes a threat to the long-term attractiveness of\n\nthe UK. Brexit is seen as a significant negative for\nUK investment, and investment sovereigns with\nEuropean interests questioned the future of the UK\nas an ‘investment hub’ for Europe, given uncertainty\nover taxes on imports and market access. Liquidity\nsovereigns also noted their concern that demand for\nUK government bonds would drop, challenging the\nliquidity of their holdings.\n\nDespite this negative sentiment, UK allocations\nremain relatively stable with stated declines\nlikely linked to currency fluctuations rather than\nwithdrawal, as demonstrated in figure 9. Furthermore,\nthe fall in value of the pound has led to a rally in UK\nstocks as export-linked businesses benefit from more\ncompetitive pricing. The low value of the pound also\nallows UK asset managers to offer their services at\na discount to international competitors. This low\nentry price into the UK represents an opportunity\nfor UK managers who can demonstrate local market\nexpertise and robust currency hedging processes to\ninternational sovereign investors.\n\nThere has also been a demonstration of ongoing\nsovereign commitment to long-term alternative\ninvestments in the UK. Many sovereigns noted that\nthey were unlikely to cancel UK real estate assets\nin the near future and there have been several\nhigh-profile statements of renewed commitment to\nUK infrastructure investments following the Brexit\ndecision, including Thames Water and Heathrow\nAirport. However, respondents noted that these are\nlong-term investments which are unlikely to move\nuntil the outlook of the UK as a preferred investment\ndestination (comparable to the US or Germany)\nbecomes clearer.\n\n17\n\nMi 2016\nM2017\n\nFig 9.
