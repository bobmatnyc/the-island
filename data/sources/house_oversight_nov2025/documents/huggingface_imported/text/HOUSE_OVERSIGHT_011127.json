The usual custom gives\ncapital letters for the former and lower-case ones for the latter. I will prefer the\nupper case for stocks and flows, and the lower one for rates. That need not hold true\n\nfor Greek letters.\n\nThe total return truism can be notated\n\nY=K,+F, (A1.1)\n\nwhere Y is output, K,, is total capital and F is cash flow.
