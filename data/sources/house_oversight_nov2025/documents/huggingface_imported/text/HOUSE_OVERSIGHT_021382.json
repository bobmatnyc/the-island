  "text": "acknowledge that loneliness is not\nsynonymous with social isolation but is a\nsocial pain that functions to motivate the\nformation and renewal of meaningful\nsocial relationships. When feelings of\nloneliness fail to accomplish their\nadaptive purpose, chronic loneliness\nmay ensue. Chronic loneliness tends to\nbe self-perpetuating through\nconfirmatory biases that alter cognitions,\nemotions, and behaviors. Given the\nimportance of social connection to\npeople’s health and well-being, it is\nimportant that we solve the puzzle of\nhow to help the chronically lonely\nconnect with others in meaningful and\nsatisfying ways.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
