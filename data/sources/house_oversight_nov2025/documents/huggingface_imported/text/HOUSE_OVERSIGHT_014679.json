Davis,\n\n371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). In addition to considering the effect of amendment on the parties, the\ncourt must consider “the importance of the amendment on the proper determination of the merits\nof a dispute.” 6 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P. § 1488, p. 814 (3d ed. 2010). Justice does\nnot require amendment where the addition of parties with duplicative claims will not materially\n\nadvance the resolution of the litigation on the merits. See Herring v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 894\n\nF.2d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir. 1989).\nA. Rule 21 Motion\n\nJane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s first attempt to join in this proceeding was brought under\nRule 21. (DE 280). “If parties seek to add a party under Rule 21, courts generally use the\nstandard of Rule 15, governing amendments to pleadings, to determine whether to allow the\naddition.” 12 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P., p. 432 (3d ed. 2013); see also Galustian v.\nPeter, 591 F.3d 724, 729-30 (4th Cir. 2010) (collecting cases and noting that Rule 15(a) applies\n\nto amendments seeking to add parties); Frank v. U.S. West, Inc., 3 F.3d 1357, 1365 (10th Cir.\n\n1993) (“A motion to add a party 1s governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15a)... .”).\n\nRule 21, “Misjoinder and Non-joinder of Parties,” provides the court with a tool for\ncorrecting the “misjoinder” of parties that would otherwise result in dismissal. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n21. Insofar as Rule 21 “relates to the addition of parties, it 1s intended to permit the bringing in\nof a person, who through inadvertence, mistake or for some other reason, had not been made a\nparty and whose presence as a party is later found necessary or desirable.” United States v. Com.\n\nBank of N. Am., 31 F.R.D. 133, 135 (S.D.N.Y. 1962) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nGIUFFRE002846\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014679",
