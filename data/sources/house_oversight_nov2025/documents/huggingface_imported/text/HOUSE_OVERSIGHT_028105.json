  "text": "difficult. Genuine peace, and trust, would inevitably take years to reach fruition.\nThat was no mere academic problem in a conflict where, for decades, our\nenemies had defined Israel’s mere existence as illegitimate. The reason for\nRabin’s reluctance to have his “deposit” presented as a set negotiating position\nwas that it meant dealing away our only card — territory — before the hard\nquestions about peace had been answered. When he phoned Christopher, I don’t\nthink I’ve ever heard him as angry. That was not what we agreed, he insisted.\nHe said it had spoiled any prospect of serious negotiations on the peace side of\nthe balance. Christopher didn’t agree there had been any real damage, nor that\nAssad had failed to understand the context.\n\nIt might not have changed things anyway, since by this stage, the Oslo talks\nhad almost completed a draft agreement. In mid-August, Rabin gave Peres the\ngo-ahead to initial this “Declaration of Principles.” It provided for a period of\ninterim Palestinian self-government; the start of a phased Israeli withdrawal\nfrom Gaza and the West Bank with the creation of a Palestinian police force to\ndeal with internal security; and a commitment to reach a full peace agreement\nwithin five years. In early September, ahead of the formal signing of the Oslo\ndeclaration, there was an exchange of “letters of recognition” between Arafat\nand Rabin. Arafat’s letter also renounced “terrorism and other acts of violence”\nand declared invalid “those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny\nIsrael’s right to exist.” A few days later, the signing ceremony was hosted by\nPresident Clinton in Washington. Thus emerged the famous photo of Rabin and\nArafat shaking hands, on either side of Clinton, who was beaming, arms\noutstretched in conciliation. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In\nthis case, you needed barely a dozen. Rabin’s demeanor, his posture, the look\non his face, all seemed to say: “I would rather be shaking the hand of anyone on\nearth than Arafat.” Still, the image was on front pages worldwide. The news\nstories spoke of a new spirit of hope. Now that these old enemies had grasped\nhands, surely a full peace agreement was within reach.\n\nMy feeling, as I watched it on TV in the kirya, was more guarded. I did hope\nfor peace, of course. I also recognized that the signing on the White House lawn\nwas just a beginning, and that my role would be to ensure that Israel’s security\nneeds were met under whatever formal peace agreement might eventually be\nreached. And the security omens were hardly encouraging. Despite Oslo,\nPalestinian attacks were continuing. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other dissident\nfactions saw Arafat’s concessions as treachery, and were setting out to drive\nhome that point with violence.\n\n257\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028105",
