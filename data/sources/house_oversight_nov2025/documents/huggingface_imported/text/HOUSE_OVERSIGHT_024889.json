Tilray will have the ability to display its name on ABG cannabis\nproducts. Tilray will initially pay ABG $100MM and up to $250MM in cash in stock. In\nreturn ABG will pay TLRY 49% of revenues from any cannabis products with any ABG\nbrand name, with a minimum of $1OMM/year for 10 years, essentially guaranteeing\nTLRY will receive a return on its initial S10OMM investment. This type of deal opens the\ndoor for CBD products to partner with IP ownership to expand brands and CBD use\npartnerships.\n\nDSW And Green Growth Brands\n\nGreen Growth Brands’ CBD infused Seventh Sense products, including foot creams and\nmuscle balms, will be sold at 96 DSW stores nationwide out of DSW’s 500-store base.\nAs the sale of CBD wellness products become widely acceptable and stigma around once\nillegal products subsides, opportunity should increase to move into other nationwide\nretailers. Under our coverage universe, Dick’s Sporting Goods may have the potential to\noffer wellness products containing CBD. DKS has a total of 864 stores nationwide. If\nDKS were to offer products in a similar percentage of stores as DSW, this would provide\n166 incremental distribution points for CBD wellness products.\n\nCOWEN.COM 73\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024889",
