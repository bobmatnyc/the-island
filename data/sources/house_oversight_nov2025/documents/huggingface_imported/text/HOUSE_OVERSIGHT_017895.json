  "text": "830\n\nleged conduct is sufficiently extreme and\noutrageous enough to permit recovery.\nStuto, at 827. The attacks on September\n11, 2001 were undoubtedly extreme and\noutrageous. The Court finds that if the\nAshton and Burnett Plaintiffs’s allegations\nsufficiently allege that Defendants sup-\nported, aided and abetted, or conspired\nwith the September 11 terrorists, they will\nhave also stated a claim for intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress. See Bur-\nnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at 107-08 (analyzing\nclaims under New York law).\n\n7. Trespass\n\n[85] The Federal Plaintiffs bring a\nclaim for trespass on the theory that De-\nfendants assisted and encouraged those\nwho intentionally entered the World Trade\nCenter property. New York courts de-\nscribe this cause of action as “the interfer-\nence with a person’s right to possession of\nreal property either by an unlawful act or\na lawful act performed in an unlawful man-\nner.” N.Y. State Nat'l Org. for Women v.\nTerry, 886 F.2d 1839, 1361 (2d Cir.1989)\n(citing Ivancic v. Olmstead, 66 N.Y.2d 349,\n352, 497 N.Y.S.2d 326, 488 N.E.2d 72\n(1985)). To the extent that the Federal\nPlaintiffs sufficiently plead that Defen-\ndants acted in concert with the September\n11 hijackers, they may proceed with this\nclaim. Wantanabe Realty Corp. v. City of\nNew York, 01 Civ. 10187(LAK), 2003 WL\n22862646, at *4 (S.D.N-Y. Dec. 3., 2003)\n(citing Pittman, 149 F.3d at 122-28).\n\n8. Negligence\n\n[86-88] In New York, a plaintiff may\nestablish negligent infliction of emotional\ndistress under the bystander or direct\nduty theory. Baker v. Dorfman, 239 F.3d\n415, 421 (2d Cir.2000). Under the by-\nstander theory, “a defendant’s conduct is\nnegligent as creating an unreasonable risk\nof bodily harm to a plaintiff and such\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nconduct is a substantial factor in bringing\nabout injuries to the plaintiff in conse-\nquence of shock or fright resulting from\nhis or her contemporaneous observation of\nserious physical injury or death inflicted\nby the defendant’s conduct on a member of\nthe plaintiff's immediate family in his or\nher presence.” Bovsun v. Sanper, 61\nN.Y.2d 219, 223-24, 473 N.Y.S.2d 357, 461\nN.E.2d 848 (1984). Under the direct duty\ntheory, a plaintiff suffers emotional dis-\ntress caused by “defendant’s breach of a\nduty which unreasonably endangered\n[plaintiffs] own physical safety.” Mortise\nv. United States, 102 F.8d 693, 696 (2d\nCir.1996).\n\n[89-92] To establish a claim for negli-\ngence under New York law, “a plaintiff\nmust show that the defendant owed the\nplaintiff a cognizable duty of care, that the\ndefendant breached that duty, and that the\nplaintiff suffered damages as a proximate\ncause of that breach.” King v. Crossland\nSavings Bank, 111 F.3d 251, 259 @d Cir.\n1997). The most basic element of a negli-\ngence claim is the existence of a duty owed\nto plaintiffs by defendants. Palsgraf v.\nLong Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 342,\n162 N.E. 99 (1928); see also Burnett I, 274\nF.Supp.2d at 108 (dismissing negligence\nclaims against Defendant Al Haramain Is-\nlamic Foundation because complaint failed\nto allege or identify any duty owed to\nPlaintiffs). Banks do not owe non-custom-\ners a duty to protect them from the inten-\ntional torts of their customers. Renner v.\nChase Manhattan Bank, No. 98 Civ.\n926(CSH), 1999 WL 47239, at *13\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 1999) (citing cases);\nBurnett [, 274 F.Supp.2d at 109 (“Plaintiffs\noffer no support, and we have found none,\nfor the proposition that a bank is liable for\ninjuries done with money that passes\nthrough its hands in the form of deposits,\nwithdrawals, check clearing services, or\nany other routine banking service.”).
