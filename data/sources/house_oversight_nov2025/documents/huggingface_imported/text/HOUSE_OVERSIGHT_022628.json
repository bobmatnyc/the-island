They are just a bunch of\ndepraved people, bloated by their excess and wealth. If Clinton has been a part of this w/Epstein, then he should\nbe in jail too where he belongs.\n\n5,\nJoAnn523\n\nMarch 27, 2014 at 12:37 pm — Log in to Reply\n\nWhy is anyone surprised ? They both have ALWAYS been disgusting and revolting along with greedy and\ncorrupt !\n\nFor the most part almost every creature like this always ends up being a filthy so called Democrat. Look at all\nthe others that are in prison or should be there now. If they were all in prison we may have a chance of a decent\ncountry once more !!!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022628",
