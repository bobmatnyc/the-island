Other than reform measures adopted in the Act, proposed\nreforms include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n* increasing regulation of pharmaceutical sales representatives;\n\n* restricting direct to consumer advertising and off-label uses;\n\n¢ limiting manufacturers’ access to marketing data;\n\n* authorizing the importation of drugs from Canada and other foreign countries to lower\npharmaceutical costs to U.S. consumers;\n\n* price discounts, formularies or rebates to government healthcare programs; and\n\n¢ allowing government healthcare programs to negotiate prescription drug prices directly\nwith manufacturers.\n\nWhile the Fund cannot predict which legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or\nwhat affect the adopted proposals, including the Act, may have on the biopharmaceutical\ncompanies in which the Fund invests, the pendency, approval or implementation of such\nproposals could decrease the Fund’s anticipated returns or adversely affect its investment\nopportunities.\n\nAvailability of Investment Capital\n\nMany portfolio companies will require several rounds of capital infusions before reaching\nmaturity. The Fund and its co-investors may not provide all necessary follow-on capital to\nportfolio companies. Accordingly, third-party sources of financing may be required. There is\nno assurance that such additional sources of financing will be available, or, if available, will be\non terms beneficial to the Fund. Furthermore, the Fund’s capital is limited and may not be\nadequate to protect the Fund from dilution resulting from multiple rounds of portfolio\ncompany financings. If the Fund does not have capital available to participate in subsequent\nrounds of financing, failure to participate may have a significant negative impact on the\nportfolio company as well as the value of the Fund’s investment.\n\nEconomic and Market Risk\n\nCompanies in which the Fund invests may be sensitive to general downward swings in the\noverall economy or in the healthcare technology sector. Changes in economic conditions,\nincluding, for example, inflation rates, industry conditions, competition, technological\ndevelopments, political and diplomatic events and trends, tax laws and innumerable other\nfactors, none of which will be within the control of the General Partner, can affect substantially\nand adversely the business and prospects of the Fund. A major recession or adverse\ndevelopments in the securities market might have an impact on some or all of the Fund’s\ninvestments. In addition, factors specific to a portfolio company may have an adverse effect on\nthe Fund’s investment in such company.

Such projections are inherently subject to uncertainty and to\n\n61 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024072",
