If not, \nI ask that you forward this e-mail to someone you believe would greatly benefit by having Michael work for \nthem. \nI know that I always appreciate when a friend refers someone who can be of great help to me — personally or in \nbusiness. \nIf you have any questions about working with Michael, please do not hesitate to call me. \nThank you. \nAttached: Cover letter \nResume \nTrump Letter of Recommendation \nSincerely, \nEric Roth \nPresident \nInternational Jet Interiors \n2221 Smithtown Avenue \nLong Island MacArthur Airport \nRonkonkoma, NY 11779 \nPhone \nFax \nCell \ne-mail \nwww.intljet.com website \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033594 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033595",
