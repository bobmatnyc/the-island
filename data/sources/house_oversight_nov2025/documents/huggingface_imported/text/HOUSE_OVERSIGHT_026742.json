  "text": "Perhaps the cosmos teems with life, even complex life; on the other hand, our Earth\ncould be unique among the billions of planets that surely exist. That would be\ndepressing for the searchers. But it would allow us to be less cosmically modest —\nEarth, though tiny, could be the most complex and interesting entity in the entire\nGalaxy — and its fate of cosmic and not merely terrestrial significance.\n\n. So let me conclude by focusing back closer to here and now.\n\nEven in the 'concertinered' timeline that astronomers envisage -- extending billions\nof years into the future, as well as into the past -- this century may be a defining era.\nThe century when humans jump-start the transition to electronic (and potentially\nimmortal) entities, that eventually spread their influence far beyond the Earth, and far\ntranscend our limitations. Or -- to take a darker view — the century where our follies\ncould foreclose the immense future potential.\n\nWe fret unduly about small risks — air crashes. carcinogens in food, low radiation\ndoses, etc. But I’s argue that we’re in denial about some newly emergent threats,\nwhich may seem improbable but whose consequences could be globally devastating.\nSome of these are environmental, others are the potential downsides of novel\ntechnologies.\n\nSo how can those of us concerned about these issues — and inspired by Carl Sagan’s\nlong-term vision — influence policy-makers?\n\nThe trouble is that even the best politicians focus mainly on the urgent and parochial\n— and getting re-elected. This is an endemic frustration for those who’ve been official\nscientific advisors in governments. . To attract politicians’ attention you must get\nheadlined in the press , and fill their in-boxes. So scientists can have more leverage\nindirectly -- by campaigning, so that the public and the media amplify their voice.\nCarl was of course ta preeminent exemplar of the concerned scientist — and had\nimmense influence through his writings. broadcasts and lectures and campaigns..\nAnd he was before the age of social media and tweets. He would have been a leader\nof the recent march for science — electrifying crowds through his passion and his\neloquence.\n\nAnd of course the challenges are global. Coping with potential shortage of resources --\nand transitioning to low carbon energy --- can’t be solved by each nation separately.\n\nScience is a universal culture, spanning all nations and faiths. So scientists confront\nfewer impediments on straddling political divides. Carl was himself close to the\nleaders of the Soviet space programme. The SETI initiative with Shklovski, and joint\nprojects with Raoul Sagdeev. And the campaign to raise concern about nuclear\nwinter.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026742",
