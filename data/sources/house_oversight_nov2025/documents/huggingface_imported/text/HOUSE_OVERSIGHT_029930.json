The researchers at-\ntempted to assess the combined impact\nof many different kinds of trials using\nmeta-analysis, a statistical technique for\nextracting information from studies that\nare not statistically significant by them-\nselves. Their article, “Is the Placebo Pow-\nerless? An Analysis of Clinical Trials\nComparing Placebo with No Treat-\nment,” published in The New England\nJournal of Medicine, was a long-overdue\nresponse to Beecher’s 1955 paper.\n\nIn almost every case, the researchers re-\nported, there was essentially no difference\nbetween the placebo group and the openly\nuntreated group. There were particular ex-\nceptions in studies of pain, where there\nwas a slight but measurable placebo effect.\nSince we are physiologically capable of\nmanufacturing our own painkillers—en-\ndorphins—the result may not have been\nsurprising. Expectations and suggestion\nclearly influence behavior, and when we\nexpect to receive medicine our bodies\noften begin to prepare for it. (As the evo-\nlutionary biologist Robert Trivers recently\npointed out, in “The Folly of Fools,” his\nbook about the historical necessity of de-\nceit, what the brain expects to happen in\nthe near future affects its physiological\nstate. Trivers’s theory would explain a fact\nthat has often baffled scientists: the pla-\ncebo effect doesn’t appear to work with\nAlzheimer’s patients. Trivers suggests that\nthis is because most people who have Al-\nzheimer’s disease are unable to anticipate\nthe future and are therefore unable to pre-\npare for it.)\n\nThe Danish researchers repeated the\nstudy in 2004, and again last year, incor-\nporating new data each time. The re-\nsults and their conclusions remained\nthe same. “We found little evidence in\ngeneral that placebos had powerful clin-\nical effects,” Hrdbjartsson wrote. “Out-\nside the setting of clinical trials, there is\nno justification for the use of placebos.”\n\nKaptchuk has great respect for Hré-\nbjartsson, yet he is wary of relying on\nmeta-analyses, and he believes that an\nhonest interaction between a doctor and\na patient can significantly alter the out-\ncome of treatment. That was the point of\nhis study of irritable-bowel syndrome, in\nwhich some subjects were told that they\nwould not be treated. I.B.S., a chronic\ngastrointestinal disorder, is one of the\nmost common reasons that people seek\n\nmedical care. Effective long-term thera-\npies have proved elusive. In Kaptchuk’s\nstudy, eighty patients were randomly di-\nvided into two groups. Patients in the first\ngroup received a placebo pill twice a day;\nthose in the second received nothing. Be-\nfore the study began, both groups were\ntold that placebos were “inert or inactive\npills, like sugar pills, without any medica-\ntion in them.” They were also informed\nthat placebos have been shown in “rigor-\nous clinical testing to produce significant\nmind-body self-healing processes.” Pa-\ntients who received the openly distributed\nplacebo scored far better on standard as-\nsessments of their condition than those\nwho received nothing. There were also\nstatistically significant differences in the\nseverity of symptoms.\n\nAlthough a group of eighty patients is\ntoo small to draw definitive conclusions,\nhonesty seemed to work. “Asbjorn’s stuff\nis a constant intellectual challenge,” Kapt-\nchuk wrote in an e-mail. “His meta-anal-\nyses are tops. Great methods, very careful.\nClear.” Yet Kaptchuk also pointed out\nthat placebos are not the only interven-\ntions that can cause complicated reac-\ntions. Drugs do, too. Opiods, for exam-\nple, increase pain in about ten per cent of\nthose who take them. Antibiotics don’t al-\nways work, and neither does cortisone, a\npowerful steroid used each year by mil-\nlions of people. Meta-analyses are useful\nto help understand large amounts of data\nfrom different trials. But statistical results\nthat combine information from a\nvariety of medical centers, with\ndifferent kinds of patients, often\nin different countries, adminis-\ntered under different conditions,\ncannot be uniform and therefore\ncannot be conclusive.\n\nHrébjartsson and Kaptchuk\nare united on at least one front.\nLike Wayne Jonas, they agree\nthat the medical system needs to\nchange. “You have to put this into\nthe context of the society in which\nyou live,” Hrébjartsson told me. “Because\nI think this may be as much a matter of\nphilosophy as of science. There is an anti-\ntechnological, anti-science feeling in the\nWest. We constantly see frustration with\nthe limits of medicine. The placebo can be\nseen in some sense as a logical avenue for\nthose frustrations. Everyone wants a sim-\nple, pain-free solution. But I wonder if that\napproach isn’t just the mirror image of the\n\npharmacological way of handling illness—\nthat there is a pill for every disease.\n\n“The entire idea of a placebo is very\n‘soapy, ” Hrébjartsson continued. “It slips\naway whenever you try to find a border.”\n\nThat has always been true. After all, for\nmany people a placebo is just a sugar pill.\nFor others, the definition includes the en-\ntire ritual of treatment, the complete inter-\naction between doctor and patient. In-\ncreased attention has mostly raised new\nquestions: What are the physical and psy-\nchological mechanisms that produce pla-\ncebo effects? What are the conditions they\nmost easily affect? And can we actually\nidentify people who respond to placebos?\nScientists now have bits of answers to some\nof those questions, but to reach their goal,\nand introduce placebos into clinical prac-\ntice, they will need to answer all of them.\n\nT Kaptchuk gets a great deal of\npleasure from focussing on what\nother people reject. Indifference seems to\nmotivate him. “I was raised in a crazy\nhome, and it prepared me to accept any\nproposition,” he said. That, he once told\nme, is why he was so active in the sixties:\n“Tt was a time when the underpinnings of\nthe universe were questioned.” Both of\nKaptchuk’s parents, who were Poles, sur-\nvived the Holocaust. “That really defines\na lot of what I do. My father was a Red,\nso I have a tendency to get pleasure from\nsubversiveness.”\n\nA particularly radical son of the six-\nties, Kaptchuk was one of the\nfounders of the Columbia Uni-\nversity chapter of Students for\na Democratic Society, in 1965,\nbut the organization was soon\ndominated by a faction that be-\ncame the Weather Under-\nground. That was too radical\neven for Kaptchuk. He fled to\nthe West Coast. “I was hanging\nout with the San Francisco Red\nGuards and reading Mao, trying\nto get away from U.S. imperial-\nism,” he said. “I was militant and crazy.\nBut at some point I said, Ted, this is not\nbeing human.”\n\nKaptchuk decided to pursue studies in\nChinese philosophy and medicine at the\nsource. Beijing had yet to open its bor-\nders to Americans, but Kaptchuk hoped\nthat his revolutionary bona fides would\nprompt the leadership to make an excep-\ntion. “My request to study there was de-\n\nTHE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 201 35\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029930",
