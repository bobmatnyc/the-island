  "text": "OGIS RECOMMENDATIONS\nFOR IMPROVING FOIA\n\nFOIA also directs OGIS to make recommendations to Congress and the\n\nPresident to improve FOIA. In April 2012, OGIS released five recommendations\n\nthat the Office compiled in its first years. For example, OGIS encouraged agency\nparticipation in FOIAonline, the Federal Government’s first multiagency FOIA\n\nportal. As a founding partner in FOIAonline, OGIS continues to support the\nportal’s improvement of services and expansion of partners.\n\nIn March 2013, OGIS issued four additional recommendations for\n\nimproving FOIA.\n\n1. IMPLEMENTING DISPUTE\nRESOLUTION FOR FOIA CONFLICTS\n\nOGIS expanded its dispute resolution program to connect FOIA professionals,\nlegal counsel, and dispute resolution professionals to embed dispute resolution\nfirmly into an agency’s FOIA process. The goal is to identify issues that are\nripe for partnership and explore ways to work together to prevent and resolve\ndisputes as well as avoid litigation.\n\nIn 2013, OGIS identified several agencies, including OGIS’s parent agency,\nNARA, to help to pilot a project designed to prevent and resolve disputes as\nwell as avoid litigation. OGIS has begun meeting with each of these agencies\nto determine the types of FOIA disputes that result in litigation and to explore\nways to incorporate dispute resolution into their FOIA processes. (OGIS\n\nalso has worked with the Administrative Conference of the United States\n\nto promote research into FOIA litigation to inform this process.) OGIS will\n\ncontinue to pilot this project in FY 2014.\n\n>\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025868",
