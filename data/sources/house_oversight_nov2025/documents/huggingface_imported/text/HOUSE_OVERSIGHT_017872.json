  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n807\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nDefendants either dispute the manner in\nwhich they were served or were not served\nin the United States. Accordingly, the\nCourt must consider an alternative basis\nfor personal jurisdiction.\n\n[43] If the New York long-arm statute\nor the ATA does not establish personal\njurisdiction, the Court will engage in a\nRule 4(k)@) analysis. Rule 4(k)(@) states:\n\nIf the exercise of jurisdiction is consis-\n\ntent with the Constitution and laws of\n\nthe United States, serving a summons or\nfiling a waiver of service is also effective,\nwith respect to claims arising under fed-\neral law, to establish personal jurisdic-\ntion over the person of any defendant\nwho is not subject to the jurisdiction of\nthe courts of general jurisdiction of any\nstate.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2). Rule 4(k)@) “fill[s] a\ngap in the enforcement of federal law” for\ncourts to exercise personal jurisdiction\nover defendants with sufficient contacts\nwith the United States generally, but in-\nsufficient contacts with any one state in\nparticular. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)@) advisory\ncommittee’s note; United States v. Int'l\nBhd. of Teamsters, 945 F.Supp. 609, 616-\n17 (S.D.N.Y.1996). For jurisdiction under\nRule 4(k)(2), there must be a federal claim,\npersonal jurisdiction must not exist over\nthe defendant in New York or any other\nstate, and the defendant must have suffi-\ncient contacts with the United States as a\nwhole such that the exercise of jurisdiction\ndoes not violate Fifth Amendment due pro-\ncess. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 945 F.Supp.\nat 617.\n\na. Purposefully Directed Activities\n\nTheory\n\nPersonal jurisdiction based on Rule 4(k)\nrequires minimum contacts with the Unit-\ned States to satisfy Fifth Amendment due\nprocess requirements. Plaintiffs claim\nthese requirements are met because De-\n\nfendants purposefully directed their activi-\nties at the United States. Burger King v.\nRudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472, 479, 105\n8.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (explain-\ning jurisdiction is appropriate if defendant\n“purposefully directed his activities at resi-\ndents of the forum and the litigation re-\nsults from alleged injuries that arise out of\nor relate to those activities” and finding\nminimum contacts existed since dispute\narose from a contract with substantial con-\ntacts with the forum) (internal quotations\nand citations omitted); Calder v. Jones,\n465 U.S. 783, 789, 104 S.Ct. 1482, 79\nL.Ed.2d 804 (1984) (finding personal juris-\ndiction appropriate over non-resident de-\nfendants who “expressly aimed” intention-\nally tortious conduct at residents of forum\nstate, even where defendants were never\nphysically present in forum); see also Da-\nventree, 349 F.Supp.2d 736 at 762-63, 2004\nWL 2997881, at *22 (finding exercise of\npersonal jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2) is\nappropriate if defendants “purposefully di-\nrected their activities at residents of the\nforum, and the litigation results from al-\nleged injuries that arise out of or related\nto those activities”). Pursuant to the hold-\nings in Burger King, Calder, and three\nrecent terrorism cases—Rein v. Socialist\nPeople’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 995\nF.Supp. 325 (E.D.N.Y.1998), Daliberti v.\nRepublic of Iraq, 97 F.Supp.2d 38 (D.D.C.\n2000), and Pugh v. Socialist People’s Lib-\nyan Arab Jamahiriya, 290 F.Supp.2d 54\n(D.D.C.2003)—Plaintiffs submit that the\nmoving Defendants knew that the primary\ntarget of Osama bin Laden’s and al Qae-\nda’s campaign of terror was the United\nStates and that by providing assistance to\nthese terrorists, who Plaintiffs claim were\nDefendants’ co-conspirators, Defendants\naimed their conduct at the United States.\n\nIn Rein, the court denied defendants’\nmotions to dismiss for lack of subject mat-\nter and personal jurisdiction in a case aris-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017872",
