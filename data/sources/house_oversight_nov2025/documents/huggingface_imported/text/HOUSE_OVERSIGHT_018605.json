  "text": "time I'm really serious about someone, I guess. Monogamy isn't necessary for these\nthings, but it would definitely make doing them less complicated.\n\n+ Societal acceptance. Straight up, monogamy is the Western societal default. In some\nways this makes monogamy hard to understand and communicate about -- because there\nare SO many assumptions and built-in expectations, and folks don't always agree on those\nexpectations! A recent study found that 40% of young couples don't agree about whether\nor not they're monogamous. That amazes me, because I have never assumed that I was\nmonogamous with a partner until we had a conversation establishing that we were\nmonogamous... but I guess I can see how it happens, if people feel anxious about\ncommunicating and fall back on assumptions instead.\n\nUsually, however, being the societal default makes monogamy easier. Heterosexual\nmonogamous people can get married with no problem, for example, and while marriage\nis obviously contested territory for non-hets, it's instructive that \"gay marriage” is such a\nbig political issue (while \"polyamorous marriage\" is currently nothing more than a\nspecter right-wingers use to scare people about gay marriage). Outsiders usually assume\nthat you're monogamous when you introduce your partner. Romantic comedies exalt\nmonogamy; the media, and many people around us, associate monogamy with love.\nWhen you're monogamous, you never have to articulate your weird relationship structure\nto your parents. You rarely have to think outside the box about relationship problems, and\nyou can go to any Western advice columnist or therapist and be sure that they'll recognize\nyour relationship as legitimate. (Those of you who like privilege checklists might enjoy\nthis monogamous privilege checklist, which is patterned after Peggy McIntosh's classic\n\nessay and white privilege checklist.)\n\n+ Some people just like it better. Occasionally, people will toy with the idea of an\n“orientational” element to polyamory or monogamy: some folks just plain feel aligned\nwith monogamy or non-monogamy. (I have similar thoughts about this as I do about\nBDSM as a sexual orientation.)\n\nPersonally, I always think it's really key, during any sex-positive critique, to emphasize\nfrom the start that whatever you like is cool as long as the actions you take are\nconsensual. I know people who act all apologetic for being monogamous, usually because\nthey've been overexposed to \"polyvangelists\" who argue that non-monogamy is \"better\"\nor \"more evolved.\" This is silly! Liking monogamy doesn't have to be justified, as long as\nyou don't turn around and claim that non-monogamy is bad and wrong. And liking\nmonogamy is a perfectly awesome reason for preferring monogamy!\n\nKK Ok\n\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/06/09/in-praise-of-monogamy/\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018605",
