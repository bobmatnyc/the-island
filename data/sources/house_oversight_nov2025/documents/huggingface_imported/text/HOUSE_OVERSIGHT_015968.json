  "text": "278 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\ncalculation can be the limiting factor. A quantum computer is very space\nefficient. When the computer branches and makes a copy of itself, it does\nso without needing more space. There are two theories for how it does\nthis, (well, three, but the third is highly controversial). The first theory is\nthe computer doesn’t need the space because it hasn't made its mind up\nyet; somehow the calculation floats in an undecided state. The second is\nthat the computer puts a copy of itself in a parallel Universe each time it\nbranches. When the calculation is over, either all the Universes collapse\nto a decision, or every possibility is chosen in some Universe or other and\nthey all go on their merry way! This is the ‘many-worlds’ interpretation\nof quantum mechanics and we will return to it later in the book.\n\nWe have now explored all the straightforward ways to make a hyper-\ncomputer, and all have failed. We need something still more exotic.\n\nMore Horse Power Needed\nIs there anything more powerful than a Turing machine?\n\nYes, in theory, there is.\n\nThe first person to explore ways of breaking the Turing limit was\nTuring himself. He cut right through the problem by proposing the\nexistence of an oracle function. At any point in a computation, you could\nask this function a question and it would give you the right answer.\n\nWe must leave completely aside the question of how this wonderful\noracle function is constructed. All we know is it can’t be a machine. If it\nreally existed, a Turing machine that was able to consult it would be able\nto answering any question you put to it. That is a hyper-computer.\n\nUnfortunately having access to such an oracle does not get us far.\nWe can use it to compute numbers we could not otherwise have obtained\n— or answer a single question — but it does not give us a general-purpose\nway to solve further problems outside of the logical area we asked it to\nanswer.\n\nEach time the oracle answers a question we break the limit a tiny\nbit. Each question and each answer moves us forward, but does not give\nus something universally applicable. If I ask the oracle to prove Fermat's\nLast Theorem it will give me that answer, but this does not turn me into\na creative mathematician, able to prove any other theory. You can test\nthis by typing a mathematical question into the Google search box. Does\nobtaining an answer make you better at mathematics?\n\nIn any case, an oracle is not and cannot be a machine, so it does not\nlead us any further in our quest to build something super-Turing.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015968",
