From 1790 to 1930, government spending on average\naccounted for just 3% of American GDP. Today, government spending absorbs closer to 24% of\nGDP.\n\nIt’s likely that they would be even more surprised by the debt we have taken on to pay for this\nexpansion. As a percentage of GDP, the federal government’s public debt has doubled over the\nlast 30 years, to 53% of GDP. This figure does not include claims on future resources from\nunderfunded entitlements and potential liabilities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the\nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). If it did include these claims, gross federal debt\naccounted for 94% of GDP in 2010. The public debt to GDP ratio is likely to triple to 146% over\nthe next 20 years, per CBO. The main reason is entitlement expense. Since 1970, these costs\nhave grown 5.5 times faster than GDP, while revenues have lagged, especially corporate tax\nrevenues. By 2037, cumulative deficits from Social Security could add another $11.6 trillion to\nthe public debt.\n\nThe problem gets worse. Even as USA Inc.’s debt has been rising for decades, plunging interest\nrates have kept the cost of supporting it relatively steady. Last year’s interest bill would have\nbeen 155% (or $290 billion) higher if rates had been at their 30-year average of 6% (vs. 2% in\n2010). As debt levels rise and interest rates normalize, net interest payments could grow 20% or\nmore annually. Below-average debt maturities in recent years have also kept the Treasury’s\nborrowing costs down, but this trend, too, will drive up interest payments once interest rates rise.\n\nCB www.kpcb.com USA Inc. — xii\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020835",
