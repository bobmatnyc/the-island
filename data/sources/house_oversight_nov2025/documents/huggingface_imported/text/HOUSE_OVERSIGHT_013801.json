I wrote it with two of my closest friends in mind, speaking directly to\nthem and their problems—problems I long had—and I focused on the unusual options that had worked\nfor me around the world.\n\nI certainly tried to set conditions for making a sleeper hit possible, but I knew it wasn’t likely. I hoped\nfor the best and planned for the worst.\n\nMay 2, 2007, I receive a call on my cell phone from my editor.\n“Tim, you hit the list.”\n\nIt was just past 5 P.M. in New York City, and I was exhausted. The book had launched five days\nbefore, and I had just finished a series of more than twenty radio interviews in succession, beginning at 6\nA.M. that morning. I never planned a book tour, preferring instead to “batch” radio satellite tours into 48\nhours.\n\n“Heather, I love you, but please don’t $4%* with me.”\n“No, you really hit the list. Congratulations, Mr. New York Times bestselling author!”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013801",
