  "text": "experiments were related in one way or another to Hannah Arendt’s thoughts about Adolf Eichmann and\nthe fact that good people are capable of horrific things: the banality of evil. Hiding behind every average\nJoe is a person equipped with an engine of malice. Banality is the veil of evil. Thus, the American\npsychologist Stanley Milgram showed that normal people were capable of shocking innocent others when\nan authority figure told them to do so; of course, there were no shocks, but the subjects believed they\nwere real. Similarly, the American psychologists Solomon Asch and Philip Zimbardo showed that\nnormal people followed group attitudes and instructions, bleating like mindless sheep, no reflection, no\ncritical thinking, no concern about the consequences of their actions. In Zimbardo’s study — the famous\nStanford prison experiments — run of the mill undergraduates playing the role of prison guards turned\ninto little dictators, mentally and physically abusing their run of the mill undergraduates playing the role\nof prisoners. Together, these studies seemed to support a blank slate view of the mind, a tablet waiting for\ninscription by the local culture, with no constraints on the written matter.\n\nA closer look at many of these studies reveals far more variation in how individuals responded,\nsuggesting that differences in their genetic make-up and personal experience either facilitated their\nwillingness to follow authority and ideology or prevented it. Many subjects in both the Milgram and\nZimbardo studies refused to follow the orders or rules of the game. Those who refused tended to identify\nmore with the victim and less with the authority figure or ideology. This suggests important differences in\nthe capacity to experience empathy and compassion for another. Studies by the cognitive neuroscientist\nEsse Viding show that by the pre-school years, some children have a diminished capacity for empathy,\nexpressing a deeply callous and unemotional character. These children exhibit severe conduct problems,\nespecially violence. These children lack remorse and an awareness of others’ distress. They are cold,\nheartless kids. If they have a twin, they are more likely to share this callous-unemotional personality than\ntwo unrelated children, revealing the trademark of a powerful genetic engine. More boys than girls fall on\nthe high end of this callous-unemotional scale — where high translates to colder and more callous. Those\nwho score highest on the scale engage in more direct physical bullying than those who score lower. High\nscorers lack the skills to modulate their behavior following direct or anticipated punishment. These\nindividuals also show reduced activity in the amygdala, a part of the brain that is critically involved in\nregulating emotion, especially the assignment of a positive or negative value on our actions and\nexperiences. These individual differences persist into adulthood. These are the kind of individual\ndifferences that can explain why some followed Milgram and Zimbardo’s instructions to perfection, while\n\nothers resisted, exerting self-control.\n\nHauser Chapter 4.
