Grossman \nREMEMBERING CAVALIER MAGAZINE \n; Mrisman02 \nLAUNCHING A MAGAZINE \nMy friend Michael Simmons, who has been the editor of National Lampoon and High \nTimes, observes that cavalier hired fine scribes. A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, \nWilliam Saroyman, Isaac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeon. Cavalier was launched by Fawcett \nPublications in 1952. \nMen's magazine Cavalier (motto: \"For the American Male\") was published the year \nbefore Playboy to whom it has often been compared, and back in the day tried to be seen as \nslightly hipper, more youthful and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost \nan anti-establishment Playboy. A slogan stated: \"Your dad bought Playboy, you \nbought Cavalier.\" \nI BECAME A COLUMNIST \nI was invited to write a column, named \"The Naked Emperor,\" for Cavalier, that was beginning \nto publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column was a \nreport on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during \ntheir first trip to America. \nThere were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist's holiday. Obviously, there wouldn't be \nenough items to go around, but it was announced that the Beatles' unwashed towels and bed \nlinens were to be cut into two-inch squares and sold for $1 each. The price included a notarized \nstatement of authenticity. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031973 \nMy second column was about Lenny Bruce___titled \"Lenny the Lawyer,\" since he defended \nhimself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy \nlaws. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill. \nLenny was alone in his hotel room on Christmas Day when I presented it to him. And, with a \nlarge safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill to the outside breast pocket of his denim dungaree \nj acket. \nAFTER JFK ASSASSINATION \nIn another column of mine, \"Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret,\" it began, \"Lenny Bruce \ntold me how all the night club comics used to Jack Ruby's \"tattoo of a lady's schmutzik (translate: \npussy) in his armpit.\" If it wasn't a fact, I was quite willing to settle for an apocryphal allusion \nwhich nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged murderer who wanted so \nvery much to be liked. \nI say alleged because upon Ruby's own death. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade said he \nwould dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no \nsuch posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on Lee Harvey Oswald. See, they grant you \nretroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual \nevent through the miracle of inadvertent televised coverage. \nNow Jack Ruby's dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of \nhistory. Oh yeah, and at Lenny's funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his jacket. \nJULES SIEGEL \nTwo years before Lenny's death, with his permission I published his obituary in my own \nmagazine, The Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to \nlet them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was \nhis life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031974 \nnow they could have a second chance because he was still alive. The obituary evoked inquiries \nfrom newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV. \n\"What's the meaning of it?\" one editor asked me. \"There's a lot of excitement at the city \ndesk.\" \n\"That is the meaning of it.\" \nA few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived \nmagazine, Cheetah, published a fake obituary of me. I thought it was funny. An Associated Press \nreporter called, and I explained that it was a hoax. \n\"Are you sure?\" he asked. \n\"Of course. I would tell you if I was dead.\" \nSiegel started writing for cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor \nbest known in Dr, Stranglove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. \nJournalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel's \"Goodbye Surfing, Hello God\" with his most \nfamous example of rock journalism, but his most revolutionary was his article, \"The Big Beat.\" \nIt appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 and was one of the earliest writings \nhe'd ever seen on the development of rock and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to \nAmerica to Bob Dylan \"going electric\" at the Newport Folk Festival. \nThen Jules' friend, Arthur Kretchmer, became Cavalier's managing editor. \"When the editorial \ndirector later resigned,\" Kretchmer said, \"there was a 24-hour hiatus before the new editor \narrived.\" Siegel and Kretchmer had been discussing the possibility of publishing an issue on rock \nand roll, so to make it happen, Kretchmer went into the office at night and retyped the magazine's \nschedule to include their ideas. \nWhen the new editorial started, Kretchmer handed him the schedules and said, \"Here's what \nwe're working on.\" The new editorial director suspected nothing and the rock and roll issue went \nahead. Once the laughter died down, Jules talked for a good 25 minutes about \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031975 \nsome of the ups and downs of his writing career and how hard it is to make a \nliving as any kind of a writer, let alone a \"rock journalist.\" and the people who \ncreated it, seriously. \nNow everybody writes about rock and roll that way. Jules was one of the \npeople who did it first. \"Goodbye Surfing, Hello God!\" is Jules's most famous \nexample of rock journalism, but I think his most revolutionary is his article \n\"The Big Beat.\" It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 \nand is one of the earliest writings I've ever seen on the development of rock \nand roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to America to Bob Dylan \n\"going electric\" at the Newport Folk Festival. \nJules Siegel died of a heart attack on November 17, 2012 at the age of 77. \nHe was a brilliant author, but neither Rolling Stone nor the New York \nTimes honored him with an obituary. Not even a fake one. \nCOMIC STRIPS \nArt Spiegelman tells me his work at Cavalier 50 years ago: \nI was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in color \nwas a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow in \nproximity to a big article on underground comix. It was around the time Vaughn Bode was made a \nregular contributor to the magazine, They were running some Crumb \"Fritz the Cat\" pages. All thanx \nto their hip, laid back and kind editor, Alan LeMond. \nI also did some gag cartoons, short strips and occasional illustrations for Cavalier (one especially \nbad drawing for a story by Bruce Jay Friedman, I recall). My work in 1969, as an apprentice \nunderground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really awful so I'm grateful for the editor's \nhip and laid-back kindness. But, hey, I was proud to be in a mag that published pieces by Pynchon, \nManny Farber and you. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031976 \nBy the time I'd gotten incrementally better as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s I was regularly \ndoing illustrations for soft-core fiction stories in Cavalier's low-rent sister \nmags, Dude, Gent and Nugget (even wrote a story or two there and got several of my San Francisco \ncomix cronies (Spain Rodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs with Alan for those \nmags as well. \nI was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in color \nwas a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow in \nproximity to a big article on underground comix. They were running some Crumb \"Fritz the Cat\" \npages. All thanx to their hip, laid back and kind editor LeMond. I also did some gag cartoons, short \nstrips and occasional illustrations for Cavalier (one especially bad drawing for a story by Bruce Jay \nFriedman). \nMy work in 1969, as an apprentice underground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really \nawful so I'm grateful for the editor's hip and laid-back kindness. By the time I'd gotten incrementally \nbetter as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s I was regularly doing illustrations for soft-core \nfiction stories, even wrote a story or two there and got several of my S.F. comix cronies (Spain \nRodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs with Alan for those mags as well. \n[Note in Wikipedia: Maus is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, \nserialized from 1980 to 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences \nas a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs postmodemist techniques and \nrepresents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. In 1992, Maus won a Pulitzer Prize.] \nCOMIING AND GOING \nI wrote some movie reviews for Cavalier. I recall that Midnight Cowboy was 50 years ago. I \nalways went to two screenings. The first one I would go stoned with magic mushrooms. The \nsecond one I took notes. However, I got fired by Cavalier. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031977 \nThey declined to publish a particular column--my review of MASH as though it were a Busby \nBerkeley musical called Gook Killers of 1970-- ostensibly on the grounds of bad taste, but I \nlearned that three wholesalers had told the publisher they were pressured by the FBI and would \nrefuse to distribute Cavalier if my name appeared in it. \nOn top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five \"radical\" campus speakers, released by the \nHouse Internal Security Committee. The blacklist was published in the New York Times, and \npicked up by newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my campus-\nspeaking engagement-bookings stopped abruptly. It felt just like a film. \nOH, WELL \nIt was over for me, but it had been fun___like the issue with only the one large red headline \non the Cavalier cover: \"BEAT 'EM SENSELESS FIRST\"___THE FREE SPEECH \nCONTROVERSY, BY PAUL KRASSNER . . . \"Ironically,\" I wrote, \"it is this concept of the \ntotal education experience on campus which I believe to be the basic significance of the much-\nmisunderstood free-speech imbroglio at the University of California in Berkeley.\" \nThe sit-in lasted till 3 a.m. Next day, October 1, 1964, ten tables were manned again, and \na campus policeman approached one of the tables (manned by the Congress of Racial Equality) \nwhere a dozen persons were seated. One was singled out and placed under arrest. But before you \ncould say nonviolent demonstration, the police car was surrounded, its captors reaching as many \nas 3,000 students. During the late evening, bored fraternity men gathered and tossed lighted \ncigarettes and eggs on those sitting in the plaza. The demonstrators responded with silence. \nNext day, 450 police assembled on campus to remove the cop car and its arrested inhabitant, \nbut an agreement to negotiate was reached and the demonstrators dispersed. One of the folk songs \nto come out of the Free Speech Movement incidentally, was If I Negotiate With You, to the tune \nof the Beatles' If IFell in Love With You. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031978 \nOver the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins and attempted negotiations, and \nthen, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students to be \narrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called Introductory Police Brutality. These were \nfrom the lab notes student took. \nThere was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who___long after she had forgotten what some \nprofessor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment___would \nremember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that if \nshe planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine \nforesight to remove the earrings from her pierced lobes in advance. \nSo, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been happening heavily at Berkeley campus again. \nMeanwhile, Trump grabbed a pussy on the Statue of Liberty. Cavalier, anyone? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031979",
