  "text": "Page 37 of 52\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *897\n\nCongress was taking an expansive view of the victim's right to be heard at sentencing, including a view that [*898] would\n262\n\nembrace a victim's right to make a specific sentencing recommendation.\nMost important, the Practitioners’ Group's letter fails to consider the impact of denying the victim access to the presentence\nreport on the victim's right to fairness. Presumably the Group, comprised primarily of defense attorneys, would be outraged if\ndefendants were sentenced without receiving notice about relevant parts of the presentence report, because of the defendant's\ndue process rights. But victims now also have due process rights during sentencing, which make it clear that they should\nreceive the same information.\n\nThe Practitioners' Group raises one concern that can be readily dispelled. The Group wonders whether a victim's right to be\nheard on Guidelines issues implies a general right to appeal a sentence. It would not. The CVRA contains its own specific\nremedial provision, which permits victims to appeal only denials of their rights. 7°? It specifically allows a victim to file a\nmotion \"to re-open ... a sentence\" only for violations of the victim's \"right to be heard.\" 2° Moreover, while victims possess\ndue process protections, due process does not guarantee a right to an appeal. *°° Finally, the Sentencing Reform Act spells out\nthe limited rights of appeal on Guidelines issues available to only the government and the defense. 7° For all these reasons,\nvictims have the right to review relevant parts of the [*899] presentence report and to be heard on Guidelines issues in the trial\ncourt, but if the court properly hears them on the Guidelines issues, victims would not have the right to appeal the sentence the\ncourt ultimately imposes.\n\nBecause victims have a right of access to the presentence report, the question arises of how to provide that access. Nothing in\ncurrent law precludes releasing presentence reports to victims. While /8 U.S.C. 3552 requires disclosure to government and\ndefense counsel, it does not forbid further dissemination. Several federal courts have held that circulation of reports to third\nparties is proper on a showing of particularized need approved by the court. 7°? Some courts! local rules also allow additional\ndistribution with court approval. 768 Victims always have a particularized need for access to the Guidelines calculations and\n\n261 See supra notes 239-44 and accompanying text.\n\n262 The Group cites a 2000 Senate Judiciary Committee Report regarding the Victims' Rights Amendment, which referenced a Tenth Circuit\ndecision restricting the right of victims to present a sentencing recommendation. See Letter from Amy Baron-Evans, supra note 258 (citing S.\nRep. No. 106-254, at 12 (2000) (discussing Robinson v. Maynard, 943 F.2d 1216 (10th Cir. 199]))). By 2003, however, the same passage in\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee Report was changed to remove the citation to that case and instead to cite a leading proponent of expansive\nrights for victims to give judges specific sentencing recommendations:\n\nVictim impact statements concerning the character of the victim and the impact of the crime remain constitutional. See Douglas E. Beloof,\nConstitutional Implications of Crime Victims as Participants, 88 Cornell L. Rev. 282 (2003). The Committee does not intend to alter or\ncomment on laws existing in some States allowing for victim opinion as to the proper sentence.\n\nS. Rep. No. 108-191, at 38 (2003). It is hard to see anything in this history suggesting that Congress wanted victims to be deprived of the\nchance to review presentence reports.\n\n263 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(5) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005). See generally Jn re WR. Huff Asset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 561-64 (2d Cir. 2005)\n(discussing appeals under CVRA).\n\n264 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(5).\n\n263 See McKane v. Durston, 153 U.S. 684 (1894).\n\n266 18 U.S.C. 3742 (2000).\n\n67 See, e.g., United States v. Corbitt, 879 F.2d 224, 238 (7th Cir. 1989) (compelling, particularized need standard); United States v. Schlette,\n842 F.2d 1574, 1579 (9th Cir. 1988) (interests of justice standard); United States v. Charmer Indus., Inc., 711] F.2d 1164, 1174 (2d Cir. 1983)\n(compelling need standard).\n\n68 See, e.g., D. Utah Crim. Local R. 32-1(c) (presentence reports not released without order of the court).\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017751",
