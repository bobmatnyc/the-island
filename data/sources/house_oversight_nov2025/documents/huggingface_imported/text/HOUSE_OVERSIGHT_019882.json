  "text": "no one to say “Go away.” Hence I became more a constant interloper than an invited guest\n—something quite close to an actual fly on the wall—having accepted no rules nor having\nmade any promises about what I might or might not write.\n\nMany of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict\nwith one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue. Those conflicts, and that\nlooseness with the truth, if not with reality itself, are an elemental thread of the book.\nSometimes I have let the players offer their versions, in turn allowing the reader to judge\nthem. In other instances I have, through a consistency in accounts and through sources I\nhave come to trust, settled on a version of events I believe to be true.\n\nSome of my sources spoke to me on so-called deep background, a convention of\ncontemporary political books that allows for a disembodied description of events provided\nby an unnamed witness to them. I have also relied on off-the-record interviews, allowing a\nsource to provide a direct quote with the understanding that it was not for attribution.\nOther sources spoke to me with the understanding that the material in the interviews\nwould not become public until the book came out. Finally, some sources spoke\nforthrightly on the record.\n\nAt the same time, it is worth noting some of the journalistic conundrums that I faced\nwhen dealing with the Trump administration, many of them the result of the White\nHouse’s absence of official procedures and the lack of experience of its principals. These\nchallenges have included dealing with off-the-record or deep-background material that\nwas later casually put on the record; sources who provided accounts in confidence and\nsubsequently shared them widely, as though liberated by their first utterances; a frequent\ninattention to setting any parameters on the use of a conversation; a source’s views being\nso well known and widely shared that it would be risible not to credit them; and the almost\nsamizdat sharing, or gobsmacked retelling, of otherwise private and deep-background\nconversations. And everywhere in this story is the president’s own constant, tireless, and\nuncontrolled voice, public and private, shared by others on a daily basis, sometimes\nvirtually as he utters it.\n\nFor whatever reason, almost everyone I contacted—senior members of the White\nHouse staff as well as dedicated observers of it—shared large amounts of time with me\nand went to great effort to help shed light on the unique nature of life inside the Trump\nWhite House. In the end, what I witnessed, and what this book is about, is a group of\npeople who have struggled, each in their own way, to come to terms with the meaning of\nworking for Donald Trump.\n\nI owe them an enormous debt.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019882",
