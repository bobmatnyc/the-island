In\nmy vision, the attitude of scientists\ntoward religion would be first of all\nphenomenological; they would first\nattempt to describe and understand\nreligious beliefs, ethics, and rituals in\ntheir full historical context. But their\ninterest in explaining some of the\nconditions that give rise to religious\nphenomena would not be inhibited by\neither religion or the wider society.\nThere are several different approaches to\nphenomenology. The perspective that I\nrecommend follows the “critical\nhermeneutic phenomenology” of Paul\nRicoeur. Ricoeur advocates beginning\nthe study of religion with a\nphenomenology — a careful description —\nof the person’s or community’s words,\nsymbols, metaphors, and narratives used\nto communicate the meaning of a\nreligious experience or practice. This\nview assumes that we cannot describe\nexperience directly but rather that\nexperience is always mediated by\nsymbols and metaphors. But Ricoeur’s\nphenomenology does not stop with a\ndescription of these meanings. It builds\nin a secondary place for science and\nexplanation. It seeks through science to\ngive explanatory accounts of the affects\nand motivations that humans bring to\nthese words, symbols, and metaphors. If\nscientists followed Ricoeur’s model,\nthey would understand the importance of\nbeginning with description, be hesitant\nto skip lightly over initial\nphenomenological meanings, appreciate\nyet grasp the limits of explanation, and\nbe reluctant to plunge into speculations,\nsuch as those of the new scientific\n\nPage |32\n\natheism, about the ultimate truth or\nfalsity of religious phenomena.”\n\nOn the other hand, the religions\nthemselves can contribute to the\nsciences. They can do this by offering\nhypotheses about how social and\nreligious ideas, behaviors, and rituals\ncan shape experience, even neural\nprocesses, often for the good but\nsometimes not. The religions can offer a\nmore generous epistemology and\nontology than science is inclined to find\nuseful for the tight explanatory interests\nof the laboratory or scientific survey.\nThis too might generate new hypotheses\nfor scientific investigation. These would\nbe some of the ground rules for how a\ndialogue between science and religion\nmight stimulate a revived religious\nhumanism.\n\nReligious Humanisms of the Past\n\nTo speak of a revival suggests\nthat there have been many expressions of\nreligious humanism in the past when\nsome form of science, philosophy, and\nreligion creatively interacted. I will\nlimit myself to speaking primarily about\nJudaism, Christianity, and Islam. A\nsynthesis between Greek philosophical\npsychology and Christianity can be\nfound in the use of Stoic theories of\ndesire by the apostle Paul, * the presence\nof Aristotle’s family ethic — with its\nimplicit psycho-biology - in the\nhousehold codes of Ephesians and I\nColossians, * and the gospel of John’s\nidentification of Jesus with the Platonic\nand Stoic idea of the pre-existent\n“Word.” A more intentional religious\nhumanism can be found in Augustine’s\nuse of the neo-Platonic Plotinus,\nespecially in the philosophical\npsychology of remembrance developed\nin his Confessions.° But the most\ndramatic example of a religious\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021278",
