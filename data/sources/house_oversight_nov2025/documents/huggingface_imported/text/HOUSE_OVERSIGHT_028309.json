This is being held at Boswall House,\n2 Cornwall Terrace - a magnificent 18th century building off Regent's Park - from 14th to 20th October. The event\nforms part of 'The House of the Nobleman'’, under the curatorship of Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria\nGolembiovskaya.\n\nFour of the finalists in New Sensations 2010 - Pablo Wendel, Katie Surridge, Nika Neelova and Ula Wiznerowicz -\nhave each been given a bursary to develop a new work for the exhibition. A short film about each of them was\naired on Channel 4 in early October.\n\nStephen Glynn, Cadogan Tate's Fine Art (http://www.cadogantate.com/fineart/) Director, comments: \"We are\ndelighted to be the sponsors of this important exhibition, which showcases the talent of some remarkable young\nartists. We have spent many years transporting and storing the world's most precious contemporary art for\nleading museums, galleries and collectors. It therefore seemed very appropriate that we should support and\nencourage the UK's leading art students through this exciting event.\"\n\nRead the full story at http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/10/prweb4659384.htm.\n\n29\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028309",
