  "text": "body is in good shape -- when I'm well-rested and I've eaten healthy food. That, too, is a\nposition of strength.\n\nIn some ways this can become murky. For example: I am rarely interested in one-night\nstands. There are a number of reasons for this, but one reason is that -- especially as a\nwoman -- feeling like a \"slut\" can be scary, difficult cultural territory. And when I don't\nfeel good about myself, my interest in one-night stands is even lower -- because I know\nthat dealing with the difficult territory of \"sluthood\" will be harder with low self-esteem.\nIf I'm feeling happy, strong, competent, valuable, and loved by the world... then one-\nnight stands can easily be fun. If | doubt my worth, or if I doubt how much I deserve\nlove... then one-night stands can be self-destructive.\n\nThe same goes for relationships with people who don't care about me. If I'm sure that a\nguy has no emotional interest in me, then having sex with that guy can be a dangerous\nemotional proposition for me, and one that I need to feel strong for. This doesn't always\nend up being true -- I've definitely had sexual encounters that left me emotionally\nunaffected -- but sometimes it's hard to predict whether I'll want more emotional\ninvestment from a given dude, so I try to keep it in mind for all encounters. (From a\npolyamorous perspective, I've noticed that less-emotional sex is often easier to handle\nwhen I'm already in a solid relationship with someone else.)\n\nA couple I know in the local S&M community will sometimes have encounters that\nabsolutely blow my mind, because they seem so difficult and so psychological. Here is an\nexample: after the pair was married and child-free for many years, the wife realized that\nshe might want children after all. This was a problem for her husband, who married her\nwith the understanding that neither of them wanted kids. It became an ongoing\ndiscussion. Then the husband -- who is also the sadistic, dominant partner -- asked her if\nthey could have an S&M encounter focused around the topic. She said it was okay.\n\nSo, as part of an S&M class that they taught together, the husband used her new feelings\nabout children to rip into her: during the S&M encounter, he told her that she was\nprobably too old to have children, that she'd waited too long. He added that she was too\nflighty for kids; that she'd be a bad mother. He added that he had always made it clear\nthat he never wanted kids; that she was stupid for marrying someone who didn't want\nkids, and that this problem was her own fault.\n\nI was not present during this class, but I heard about it from some attendees, and it sounds\nlike it was really intense. He used a genuine and difficult sore spot to put his wife through\na psychological S&M wringer, with her consent.\n\nThese days, I feel very tempted towards encounters like that: encounters that can tear me\napart on a deep level, using important weaknesses and insecurities. I've also received\nemail from other people who want to arrange encounters like that, and who ask my\nadvice. An obvious problem is that such a relationship could easily slip into abusive\nterritory.\n\nSo I've thought about this a lot, and here's my conclusion: those kind of intense\npsychological encounters obey the same maxim as other BDSM -- \"Start from a position\nof strength, and seek strength in the end.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018633",
