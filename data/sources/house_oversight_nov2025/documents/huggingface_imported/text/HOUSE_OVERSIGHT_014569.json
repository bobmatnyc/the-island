  "text": "SECTION II\n\n2017 Global\nEconomic Outlook:\nWinds of Change\n\nFOR MOST OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, GLOBAL POLICY MAKERS\nhave been buffeted by the gale force headwinds generated by\nthe financial crisis. In response, central banks around the world\nhave expanded their balance sheets by a staggering $12.5\ntrillion,”” while fiscal austerity measures in the G-7 economies\nhave reduced the general government budget deficit from 10%\nof GDP to just 3.6% today.\n\nAlthough this mix of policies may have helped avoid a\nsecond Great Depression, it has fallen short of fostering a\nrobust economic recovery. According to the IME, the nominal\nGDP of advanced economies has grown at just a 1.6%\nannualized pace in US dollar terms since its 2009 trough,\nmaking it among the slowest expansions on record. The\novert reliance on monetary policy has also had unintended\nconsequences. Persistently low interest rates have crippled\nbank profitability and penalized savers. Moreover, the boost\nthat low rates provide to stock prices primarily benefited a\nnarrow segment of the income distribution, exacerbating\ninequality concerns. Not surprisingly, populism has been on\nthe rise globally.\n\n36 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014569",
