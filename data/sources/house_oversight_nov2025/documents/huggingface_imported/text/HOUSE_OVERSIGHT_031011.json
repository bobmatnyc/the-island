Ron Blagojevich. \nBarack Obama: \"I only saw Rod Blagojevich one time ... and that was in the stands and from \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031012 \na distance at a Chicago Bears Football Game.\" \nRod Blagojevich, Barack Obama and Richard Daley during a rally in Chicago , April \n16, 2007. (Photo Reuters) \nTo understand the next 4 years, you have to understand the world according to Chicago ... \nWhile Chicago is a city in Illinois , it is almost a completely different country when \nit comes to politics, with a whole different set of morals and language. \nThere are only three rules and a Prime Directive which anybody can understand. You don't \neven need an attorney to understand them --and if you need an attorney, well, you know too \nmuch...so look out for Rule #3! \nRULE #1...No matter what you see, hear, or do --you don't know anybody and you don't \nknow nothing! \nRULE #2...If you capture something on tape or camera -- it doesn't reveal nothing! \nRULE #3...If you know what everybody knows in Chicago --well, you still don't know \nnothing. \nThe PRIME DIRECTIVE in CHICAGO ...No matter what the vote Democrats win \nthe election. Now pay close attention! \nIt's very simple....we'll illustrate. Remember, you know nothing. \nThese two? They don't know each other! They said they didn't. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031013 \nThe fellas in this picture. They never actually met face to face. What fellas? We don't see \nnothing! \n• \nThe guy on the left? For all you know he's Santa Claus. \nAnd the guy on the right.., well, he's the Easter Bunny! That's all you need to know. \nGo to your eye doctor...your eyes are lying to you! Ca'pish? \nRemember Jimmy Hoffa? He knew too much and now, well, now no one knows where \nhe is. \nIs the big picture clear? Not these pictures! Remember, You've already forgot them... \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031014 \nGovernor Ellogojevich confers with now President-Elect Elorock Obomo \nNow, ain't that simple? They don't know each other and they never met! \nHow is that possible? 'cause they said so! And don't forget it! \nP.S. If you pass this on to your friends, don't forget, you know nothing and they will \nknow nothing. \nDavid Gibson, M.D. Chicago \nSteven Summerlin \nReply to sender Reply to group Reply via web post Start a New Topic \nMessages in this topic (1) \nRecent Activity: \nVisit Your Group  \nSwitch to: Text-Only, Daily Digest • Unsubscribe • Terms of Use \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031015 \nArmando Fernandez,D.D.S. \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
