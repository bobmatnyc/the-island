  "text": "KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\n\nMost important, however, is that the extraordinary nature of this misconduct, so unusual\nin ordinary federal prosecutions, raises the gravest of concerns about why prosecutors would go\nto such lengths in a case already being prosecuted by the State and with so little, if any, federal\nconcern. Accordingly, we ask you to conduct your own investigation of these matters, because\nwe believe that what we have provided you may constitute only the tip of a very deep iceberg.\nWithout the power of subpoena, which we currently lack, we are unable to dig deeper. We\nstrongly believe that there is far more exculpatory evidence that has not been disclosed, more\nleaks that we have not yet uncovered and more questionable behavior. This is a case that cries\nout for a deeper investigation than we are capable of conducting, before any decision to\nprosecute is permitted.\n\n11\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012170",
