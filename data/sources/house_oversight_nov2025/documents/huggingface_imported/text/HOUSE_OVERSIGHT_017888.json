  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n823\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nMar—Jac Investment, Inc., Mena Corpora-\ntion, Reston Investment, Inc, Sterling\nCharitable Gift Fund, Sterling Manage-\nment Group, Inc., Success Foundation, and\nYork Foundation.” Jd. 1224. Allegedly,\nmany of the entities are related by com-\nmon management, few of them maintained\na physical presence at their purported\nplace of business, and they all “have long\nacted as fully integrated components of al\nQaeda’s logistical and financial support in-\nfrastructure.” Jd. 191 225, 226.\n\nPlaintiffs argue the Court has personal\njurisdiction over the SAAR Network be-\ncause it participated in the conspiracy that\nresulted in catastrophic effects in this dis-\ntrict. After an ongoing investigation in\nthe Eastern District of Virginia, federal\nauthorities raided the offices of several of\nthese Defendants in Herndon, Virginia in\nMarch 2002. Jd. 1227. The investigation\nhas allegedly revealed that SAAR Net-\nwork funds have been transferred to des-\nignated terrorists and al Qaeda operatives\nYoussef Nada and Ahmed Idris Nasred-\ndin. Jd. 1228; see Exec. Order No. 13224\n(designating individuals as_ terrorists).\nAdditionally, Plaintiffs claim that the in-\nvestigation has revealed that SAAR Net-\nwork entities have engaged in transactions\nwith Bait Ul-mal, Inc. (BMD, which has\ntransferred funds to terrorist organiza-\ntions including al Qaeda, and materially\nsupported the 1998 embassy bombings in\nAfrica. Federal Complaint 1 229-230.\n\n[69] At this stage, the Court must ac-\ncept as true Plaintiffs’ allegations con-\ncerning the relationships of the SAAR\nNetwork. Jd. 99222, 226. Defendants\ncorrectly argue, however, that Defendants\nhave provided scant basis for linking\nthese entities under the SAAR Network\ntitle. Certain of these groups may be\nsubject to personal jurisdiction in light of\nPlaintiffs’ allegation that they purposeful-\nly directing its activities at the United\n\nStates by transferring money to designat-\ned terrorists Youssef Nada and Ahmed\nIdris Nasreddin, particularly if they in-\ntended the money to support terrorism.\nId. 1228. Additionally, general jurisdic-\ntion could be appropriate for the SAAR\nNetwork entities having offices in Virgi-\nnia. Jd. 1227. Accordingly, the SAAR\nNetwork’s motion to dismiss is denied\nwithout prejudice. The parties are to en-\ngage in jurisdictional discovery to deter-\nmine which of the Network’s entities have\na presence in Virginia and which entities\ntransferred money to Nada and Nasred-\ndin.\n\n10. Adel A.J. Batterjee\n\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs claim that Defen-\ndant Adel A.J. Batterjee is an associate of\nOsama bin Laden. Burnett Complaint\n9181.
