Not -- you know, let's break that down ina\ncouple pieces.\n\nThe fact that his name is circled, if I were\nrunning an FBI investigation, I'd go send somebody to\nsee what he knew about it, but no, it would take a fot\nmore for me to become suspicious that somebody is\ninvolved in -- in sexual activity like that.\n\nQ. Okay. So you would agree with me then, that\nthe fact that a person often visited the mansion, the\nperson -- the fact that a person was a friend of\nMr. Epstein for 15 years, the fact that the person had\nstated publicly that: \"Mr. Epstein liked young women\nalmost as much as I do myself,” and the fact that the\nname is circled in the address book is not sufficient to\nraise a Suspicion that that person engaged in sexual\nmisconduct?\n\nA. So...\n\nQ. Yes or no. It's a yes or no question.\n\nA. It requires --\n\nMR. SCAROLA: You're not required to answer\nyes or no, if a yes or no response alone would be\nmisleading.\n\nTHE WITNESS: The problem is the word\n\"suspicion.\" I'm not particularly suspicious on\nthose facts, but it -- you know, what do you mean\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n249\nby \"suspicion\"? If 1 -- if I were running an FBI\ninvestigation and somebody circled a name as --\nas saying, look, this fellow may have some\ninformation, I'd go follow up on that.\n\nIf you say that's suspicion, then the answer\nwould be, yes. But I -- you know, based on that\ninformation alone, no. I mean that -- that\nwouldn't -- wouldn't be enough for me to, you\nknow, invest time and energy into that particular\npossibility.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Okay. So none of those facts are sufficient\neven to justify spending time and energy, correct?\n\nA. Unless -- if I'm running -- this is -- again,\nwhat do you mean by \"suspicion\"? Time and energy in the\ncontext of somebody who is running a pro bono case with\nlimited resources to try to figure out what the sex\ntrafficking ring's going to do, I'm not going to chase\nafter that rabbit. It seems farfetched.\n\nI'm going to focus my efforts on the people\nwho appear to be more directly involved.\n\nQ. Okay. So based on the facts that I gave you\na moment ago, you think it's farfetched that Donald\nTrump was engaged in abusing minors?\n\nA.
