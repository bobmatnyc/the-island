  "text": "“Tf you had a billion dollars I would think the last thing you should be\nworried about was money, in truth money was what you most worried about.\nHow to make more of it, how to give away more of it, how to protect you\nchildren from it, how to hide it from your wife or husband, how to minimize\nyour taxes on it. The traditional wealth service structure, an accountant, and\ninvestment advisor, a personal lawyer, and an idiot brother-in-law, became\nhopelessly outdated as amounts exponentially increased.\n\n“You can’t spend a billion dollars, you can just relocate it to a different\ninvestment class. And you can’t give away a billion dollars without a vast\nstaff, in effect going into the business of giving away money, yet another\nbusiness you are likely to know little about.”\n\nAt just about this point in the narrative, the questions or the\nincredulity begins in social circles and eventually in the media. He begins to\nacquire the major symbols of riches but does this without position, public\nholdings, or obvious paper trails. In essence, the formulation is, how can a\nperson have enough money to merit increasing attention, but no clear way of\nhaving gotten it. Epstein gets stuck in that tautology. He may be rich, but he\nis without institutional protection or bona fides. He 1s a questionable\nsubstrata of wealth. He’s a freelancer.\n\nThat’s the rub: he doesn’t work for anyone. Without institutional\ncredentials he’s...well, nobody knows what.\n\nFor a period, one part of his activities he says is recovering monies for\ncountries looted by exiled dictators or military strongmen. If early in his\ncareer he might seem like a sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical\nresemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s George\nPeppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.\n\nThen, in his telling, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy people\nand families. He’s not just doing their bidding or their investing, he’s\nhelping them to imagine the ambitions of their wealth. They’ve\nsatisfied their business dreams. Now there are the separate\nchallenges and possibilities of their actual wealth.\n\nIn essence, as he becomes more public the response to this, as a\nfunction of envy and the media’s need for definition, is “bullshit.” True,\nthere is no clear alternate narrative. No one is accusing him of anything,\naccept, sometimes, guilt by association. (In addition to Robert Maxwell, who\nwill be accused of fraud, there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a New York high\nflyer, who went to jail for a Ponzi scheme, for whom Epstein acted as a\nconsultant.) But the characterization persist: if it’s not clear, it must be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022718",
