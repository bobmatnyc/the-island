  "text": "Notes from Aspen Strategy Group\n\nUS Policy on Arab Revolutions\nTJP summary: Plenty of different opinions on what was done right and wrong. No\n\nconsensus.\n\nIndyk: syria will spill into Bahrain and KSA (Saudi). We should have moved earlier.\nKSA is a BFD.\n\nFeaver (ex Bush): BO's obsession w anti Bush (especially wrt Iraq) has\nunnecessarily limited Administrations ability to engage in Iraq which -as we see\nnow w Syria - is just dumb.\n\nDannzinger (ex Obama Admin): obama has done a remarkable job and the only\nway he could have done better is if I had held a senior post in the Administration.\nKahl (ex Obama Admin) : Feaver is living in a fantsy world. BO couldn't make a\nSOFA deal w NAM. He tried, but we had no leverage and Iraqis wanted to break\nsense of occupation. So President went to zero based engagement and now wants\nto build engagement w Iraq from zero base.\n\nFlornoy: Feaver, you make me feel like I lived in a different reality. Did a good job\nof articulating \"lead from behind\" strat in Libya. When you consider our national\ninterests in the context of our domestic condition, we did the best we could.\nZelikow: what are the top priorities of admin. Defeat AQ and avoid a \"pre mature\nwar w Iran; avoid Iraqi civil war - Iraq is moving troops now to west; manage the\nhot situations in ME.\n\nFroman: \"lead fom behind\" is not admin policy. Leverage our resources and those\nof our allies.\n\nHadley: now in era of big bets. We need to define our objectives and spot moments\nwhen we should lead and take a big bet.\n\nMaghan O: advancing our interests w a Lead from behind or a light handed\napproach will only work if a numner of assumptions are accurate (eg Muslim Bro\nwill moderate; monarchy -KSA- will self reform). These are big assumptions and\ntherefore using a light hand may fail. Agrees w Hadly that there are times we should\ntake a big bet and Iraq would have been an example of that.\n\nIndyk: we need to engage more in Syria. It is a regional lynch pin and lead from\nbehind won't work.\n\nFeaver: Dannzinger is uncharacteristically wrong. A different approach 4 yrs ago\nwould have left us in better positions in Iran Iraq and Syria.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025797",
