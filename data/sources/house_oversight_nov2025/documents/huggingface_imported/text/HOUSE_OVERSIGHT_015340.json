  "text": "mention an assistant editor at a conservative magazine who infiltrated a\ngroup of protesters in Washington, D.C., later claiming that his purpose\nwas “to mock and undermine them in the pages of the American\nSpectator,\" and that he helped incite a riot at the National Air and Space\nMuseum, getting pepper-sprayed in the process.\nMoreover, a document from the Houston FBI revealed their plan\n“to engage in sniper attacks” and “kill the leadership” of the Occupy\nactivists “if deemed necessary.”\n\nThe Yippies were essentially countercultural, an amalgam of\nradicalized stoned hippies and straight political activists. And, although the\nOccupiers are essentially mainstream, their demonization by right-wing\nmedia pundits has been providing a repeat performance of neutralizing a\nprogressive cause.\n\nBill O' Reilly called the Occupiers “drug-trafficking crackheads”\nand “violent America-hating anarchists.” Sean Hannity said they “sound\nlike skinhead Nazi psychos.” Ann Coulter referred to them as mobs of\n\n“teenage runaways” and “tattooed, body-—pierced, sunken-chested 19-\nyear-olds getting in fights with the police for fun.” Glenn Beck warned\n\nthat they “will come for you and drag you into the streets and kill you.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015340",
