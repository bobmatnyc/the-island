  "text": "®) ROCKEFELLER & CO.\n\nAccountability & Reflection\n\nAs the Governor of the Bank\n\nof England Mark Carney said\n\nin 2015, the “crisis and its\naftermath laid bare that many\n\nof our markets didn’t live up to\nthese standards” of transparency,\nresponsibility and accountability,\nand warned that until markets\nregain those qualities they cannot\nretain their social license to\noperate. |\n\nThe crisis also underscored the\nlack of effective shareholder\nscrutiny of boards of directors\nand senior management on\nessential corporate governance\nissues such as risk management,\ncorporate strategy, independence\nand long-term value creation.\n\nTo overcome these shortcomings,\nthe global investment community\ntook on the role of “active\n\nstewardship’ in capital markets.\nIt started to adopt stewardship\ncodes to engage with companies\nin seeking to improve business\npractices and disclosures. These\nefforts were focused on seeking\nmajor reforms towards financial\nstability and greater corporate\nresponsibility.\n\n2010: Active Stewardship is Born\n\nThe concept of “active\nstewardship’ was first introduced\nin the United Kingdom in\n\n2010 when the country’s\nFinancial Reporting Council\nintroduced the UK Stewardship\nCode.” According to the code,\nstewardship means that investors\nare expected to proactively\nengage with companies on issues\nof strategy, performance, risk,\ncapital structure, and corporate\ngovernance, including culture and\nremuneration.\n\nIn January 2017, a group of U.S.\nand international institutional\ninvestors with combined assets\nof $17 trillion followed suit\n\nand launched the first U.S.\nStewardship Code.\n\nThe adoption of stewardship\ncodes in many national\n\nmarkets highlights a new set of\nresponsibilities for shareholders.\nBy signing on, institutional\ninvestors commit to closely\nmonitor their companies and\n\nto use their voting power to\nimprove corporate behavior.\n\nAs fiduciaries, investors also\ncommit to be more transparent\nabout their own activities to their\nclients and other stakeholders.\n\nToday, active stewardship\nincludes many environmental,\nsocial and governance (ESG)\nissues that are priorities for those\ninvesting with a sustainability\nmindset. As fiduciaries, we\n\nat Rockefeller & Co. seek to\nengage with boards of directors\nand senior management on\n\nESG issues to identify potential\nlong-term business risks and\nencourage opportunities such as\nmanagement quality and ethics,\nhuman capital and labor issues,\nclimate change and low carbon\neconomy. We believe that such\nengagements can have a long-\nlasting impact both on business\nprofitability and competitive\nadvantage.\n\nBeyond the potential long-\n\nterm investment growth and\nsustainability benefits of\nimplementing these engagement\nactivities, institutional investors\nare leading the efforts to rebuild\ntrust in public markets after the\nFinancial crisis, starting where the\nissues were most apparent — the\nfinancial services sector.\n\nEmbracing Change: Financial Services Sector\n\nBorne out of the trauma from\n2008 and a new stricter reg-\nulatory environment, financial\nservices companies were the first\nto face this new level of share-\nholder scrutiny and engagement.\n\nWall Street came under pressure\nby regulators and society to take\nsignificant steps to change its\ncorporate governance guidelines,\nbusiness practices and culture.\n\n3 ACTIVE STEWARDSHIP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\nIt may come as a surprise to learn\nthat several large banks led the\nreform efforts in 2010 by review-\ning their business standards and\nethics codes and implementing\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012074",
