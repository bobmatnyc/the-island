  "text": "Finally, the US remains committed to an effective missile defence\nsystem to defend against emerging missile threats, such as from Iran\nand North Korea. In Europe our approach was embraced by Nato at\nthe Lisbon summit, and it paves the way for missile defence co-\noperation between Russia and the US, enhancing the security of both\nnations, and Europe.\n\nStanding in Prague two years ago, President Obama said some\nbelieve “we are destined to live in a world where more nations and\nmore people possess the ultimate tools of destruction”. But he also\nwarned that “such fatalism is a deadly adversary”. Two years on, it is\nclear that, when the international community works together to meet\na shared threat, progress is possible. We remain confident that if this\nmomentum is sustained, a world where fewer nations possess these\nultimate tools of destruction is within our grasp.\n\nThe writer is national security adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023490",
