  "text": "intent on implementing bioterrorism as the new form of explosive terrorism.\"\n\n(Note that both members of this family were awarded BILLION dollar contracts; that's quite\nexceptional, no?)\n\nAs for terrorism as an US industry, it's hardly better seen than through the following which is\ninformation of course we all know:\n\nWe note that in-between Bush #41's 9/11/1990 speech(with Dick Cheney as his Secretary of\nDefense) and the 9/11/2001 attack on the WTC were little more than Clinton's 8 years in the White\nHouse. We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between\nthe actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack\non the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no\nuncertain terms sponsored terrorism:\n\n(Writes Scott) \"The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult\nand painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection we\nhave surveyed:\n\n1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to\nparticipate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing;\n\n2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which could\nhave prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing;\n\n3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him\nfree to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing;\n\n4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an \"unindicted coconspirator\" in the 1993 WTC bombing case\nand Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing.\n\n(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State)\n\nScott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack on\nthe WTC:\n\n(Writes Scott) \"For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened,\nletting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by some\nas \"conspiracy theory.” Yet in this chapter, | will show that this claim doesn't to arise from theory, but\nfrom facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-reported in\nthe American mainstream media. | am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just once, but\nrepeatedly, almost predictably. We shall see that, among the al-Qaeda terrorists who were first\nprotected and then continued their activities were the following:\n\n1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi Embassy\nbombing;\n\n2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier\nof both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed;\n\n3.
