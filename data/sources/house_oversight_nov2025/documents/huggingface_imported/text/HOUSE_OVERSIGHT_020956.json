These different growth rates have become\neven more pronounced in recent years.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) Isn’t it time for a re-set and acknowledgment of trade-offs? Should taxes,\nnon-defense discretionary spending, and defense spending grow in line with\nGDP over time? Should entitlement spending be restructured to be more\nefficient and supportable by the ongoing financial dynamics of USA, Inc. and\nalso grow in line with or below GDP?\n\nNote: All data are inflation adjusted using GDP price index from BEA; 05 vs. 40-yr variance is rounded.\nKP Data source: White House Office of Management & Budget.\n(@E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 230\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020956",
