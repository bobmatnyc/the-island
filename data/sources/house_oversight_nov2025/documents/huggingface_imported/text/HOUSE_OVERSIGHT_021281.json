  "text": "uses evolutionary theory on inclusive\nfitness to order many of his findings.\nFrom the perspective of this model of\nbasic human motivations, loneliness can\nbe seen as a condition that “promotes\ninclusive fitness by signaling ruptures in\nsocial connections and motivates the\nrepair or replacement of these\nconnections.” '° According to his\ninterpretation of inclusive fitness, our\ngene continuity is not assured by simply\nhaving our own children. Our children\nalso must have children as well. And\nthis is a challenge entailing long-term\nexpenditures of energy. To account for\nthis, Cacioppo writes something about\nhuman infant dependency that is very\nclose to what both the Greek philosopher\nAristotle and the medieval Roman\nCatholic theologian Thomas Aquinas set\ndown many centuries earlier. Cacioppo\nsays,\n\nFor many species, the offspring need\nlittle or no parenting to survive and\nreproduce. Homo sapiens, however,\nare born to the longest period of\nabject dependency of any species.\nSimple reproduction, therefore, is not\nsufficient to ensure that one’s genes\nmake it into the gene pool. For an\nindividual’s genes to make it to the\ngene pool, one’s offspring must\nsurvive to reproduce. Moreover,\nsocial connections and the behaviors\nthey engender (e.g., cooperation,\naltruism, alliances) enhance the\nsurvival and reproduction of those\ninvolved, increasing inclusive\nfitness. ‘7\n\nAccording to this view, the\ntwofold interaction between inclusive\nfitness and the long period of infant\ndependency has shaped humans over the\nlong course of evolution into the social\n\nPage |35\n\nand caring creatures we are. Sociality is\na fundamental characteristic of humans,\nand, according to Cacioppo, spirituality,\nin its various forms, is an extension of\nsociality. Religion is generally,\nalthough not always, good for our\nmental and physical health - our heart,\nour blood pressure, our self-esteem, and\nour self-control - just like having good\nfriends and family or not being lonely\nare also good for our well-being. '*\nCacioppo and colleagues do not equate\nsociality and religion; they are fully\naware that religions are complex\nphenomena with many different\ndoctrinal, ethical, ritual, organizational,\npersonal, and social features that require\neither rigorous experimental or clinical\npopulation studies to sort out, even from\nthe perspective of how they affect\nhealth. Nonetheless, he seems to hold\nthat the sociality that most religions offer\nis a key reason for their efficacy in\nhuman well-being.\n\nDoes Christian Love Build on Health?\n\nBut my concern is the topic of\nChristian love and not simply\nChristianity’s contribution to mental and\nphysical health. Although Jesus is said\nto have performed miracles of health,\noffering health in this world has never\nbeen at the core of Christianity or, for\nthat matter, the other Abrahamic\nreligions of Judaism and Islam.\nBringing to maturity loving and self-\ngiving persons has been the primary\nconcern of Christianity, whether or not\nthis contributes to health and well-being.\nBut the question is, as I elaborated\nabove, does Christian love build on eros\n- that is, our strivings for health and\nother goods - or come exclusively from\nsome trans-natural source as Nygren\nbelieves the normative tradition taught?\nAnd did Christianity ever identify eros\nand our deepest motivations with\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021281",
