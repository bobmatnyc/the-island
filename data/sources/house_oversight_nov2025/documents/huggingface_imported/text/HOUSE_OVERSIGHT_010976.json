  "text": "when our science hats are on. Even philosophy, in the Western tradition, leaves\nrevelation aside. A practical consideration is that debates of how God is likely to be\nmotivated to intercede have tended to find little consensus or traction. Science gets\n\nsome.\n\nI tipped my hand on my own views in Chapter 1. As chairman of the Leakey\nFoundation for more than 40 years, | pretty clearly buy evolution theory and\nunguided natural casualty as working assumptions. But I invite those who don’t to\nread further before deciding that we will disagree on conclusions. If] foresaw a\nconflict with the devout, which | don’t, I would feel obligated to warn them now. I'll\n\nbring this up again as we go along.\n\nMy next few axioms, lumped together, are a mortal and reproducing population\nwhich competes, cooperates and freelances to act on convergent predictions. It acts\nto satisfy convergent tastes in a world of limited resources. I will model the\npopulation as human, although other species would do insofar as my axioms hold\nfor them. “Convergent” means non-identical from individual to individual or place to\nplace or moment to moment, but converging to norms with increasing scale in space\n\nand time. Predictions converge to outcomes as well as to one another.\n\nThe point is that tastes and predictions must be convergent enough for markets to\nform and hold. A market, as Becker knew, is where anyone makes any choice among\nalternatives. A literal market is where a choice leaves a quantitative record. Markets\ncannot form and hold if we cannot predict where to find them and what they supply\nand when they are open. They cannot form and hold without some consensus that\nwhat we predict they will offer includes something we want. Clothing stores can\nwork because our sizes and shapes fall mostly within standard ranges. Their\nbusiness would be in trouble if we did not agree in number and rough placement of\narms and legs and head. Restaurants can work because we can find what we want\non a finite menu. Most crucially, clothing stores and restaurants cannot hold unless\n\nthere is consensus on what their wares are worth in return. All this convergence\n\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010976",
