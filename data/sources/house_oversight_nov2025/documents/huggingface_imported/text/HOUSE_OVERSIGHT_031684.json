Rybolovlev purchased it for $127 million in 2013 through his art dealer, the\nSwiss businessman Yves Bouvier. Bouvier, the owner and operator of several freeports,\nbought the painting for $80 million with the intention of selling it to Rybolovlev at a steep\nprofit. Its owner before Bouvier, the New York City-based gallerist Robert Simon, found\nthe painting at an estate auction in New Orleans in 2005. He paid just $10,000.\n\nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:41 PM Michael Wolff a wrote:\n\nYou\n\nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:40 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nhave an art guy?\n\nIn addition my art guyd said the painting wasn’t very good\n\nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:37 PM Michael Wolff (i wrote:\n\nStarting to smell sweet, the way you put it!\n\nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:35 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nreminder trump overuled congress on yemen .\n\nOn Thu, May 30, 2019 at 5:33 PM Michael Wolff {i wrote:\nSo MBS was paying him off?
