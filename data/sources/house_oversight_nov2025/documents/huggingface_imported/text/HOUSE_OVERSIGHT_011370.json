When you look at the stories that\n\nactually were pulled off the internet, a substantial number of\n\nthem relate to the Cassell-Edwards-—Dershowitz litigation; what\n\nhappened in the litigation, statements made by the parties in\n\nthe litigation, statements made about Virginia Giuffre relevant\n\nto that litigation.\nIf her reputation is damaged by some other litigation\nthat has nothing to do with Ms. Maxwell, Ms. Maxwell can't be\n\nresponsible for that reputational damage.\n\nTHE COURT: What's your explanation of the damage\n\ncaused to Giuffre by the Dershowitz case?\n\nMS. MENNINGER: I'm sorry?\n\n7\n\nTHE COURT: I understand the testimony part. That's a\n\ndifferent kind of thing. But the case itself, how does that\n\ndamage her reputation?\n\nMS. MENNINGER: It's the press attendant to that case,\n\nyour Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. So the press attendant.\n\nMS. MENNINGER: There was a lot of press attendant to\n\nthat case which was, frankly, negative to the plaintiff that\nhad nothing do with Ms. Maxwell's denial. And their experts\nhave relied on that press and claimed that that press somehow\nsupports their claim for damages against Ms. Maxwell, even\n\nthough she's not mentioned in the particular stories.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011370",
