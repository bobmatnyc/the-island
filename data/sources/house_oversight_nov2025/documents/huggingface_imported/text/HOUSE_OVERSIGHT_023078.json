Our\nanalysis assumes Trump’s/the Blueprint’s proposed rates of 8.75%/10%, and that all\noverseas profits are hit with this one-time tax, as suggested by their plans. See Table\n\n10.\n\nNote that our estimate of ~$1.2tn of cumulative profits overseas is based on estimates\nfrom us, our fundamental analysts, and company filings, where in many cases only\noverseas cash but not other indefinitely invested earnings are disclosed/estimated.\nThus, the tax on these earnings could be slightly higher, though the Blueprint would tax\nearnings not held in cash at a lower 3.5% rate. (We conservatively assume our estimated\n$1.2tn is all cash and use the higher 8.75% rate under the Blueprint and 10% under\n\nTrump’s plan in our below analysis}.\n\n10 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023078",
