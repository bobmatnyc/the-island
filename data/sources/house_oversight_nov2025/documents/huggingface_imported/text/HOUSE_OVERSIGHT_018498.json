  "text": "and hard to predict, and there aren't any good medical resources on the matter. Maybe the\npain points to something unusual about my constitution. Maybe there's a reason it's\nharder for me to have orgasms than the \"average\" woman.\n\nBut the vaginal pain itself is not overwhelming, on the rare occasions that it crops up.\nAnd the vaginal pain is not even close to the most central issue of my sexuality -- or the\nbiggest influence on my orgasmic ability.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nI. S&M\n\nI identify my sexuality as BDSM -- a.k.a. kink, leather, fetish, S&M, or B&D. BDSM is a\n6-for-4 acronym that encompasses a host of related activities, including bondage,\ndiscipline, dominance, submission, sadism and masochism. And yeah, I'm really into it:\nmy desires are heavy and overwhelming; I dream of agony, of terrified screams for\nmercy. I've gone so far as to describe BDSM as my sexual orientation.\n\nBefore someone goes leaping to conclusions, there is a definite difference between \"good\npain\" and \"bad pain.” The occasional pain I feel within my vagina is not good pain; it's\nnot even interesting. It's just annoying. It's not sexy or enjoyable at all.\n\nSome of us in the BDSM community have felt lifelong tendencies towards BDSM. We\nhave conversations ending with thrilled exclamations: \"You mean, you tied up your\nBarbie dolls as a child too?!\" But BDSM is widely misunderstood and negatively\nstereotyped, and thus, many of us also went through periods of rejection. We've\ninternalized so much anti-BDSM stigma from society that, at times, we freak out. We\ndeny or erase our BDSM desires.\n\nThat's what happened to me when I was in middle school. As my sexuality made itself\nmore and more evident, my anxiety peaked. I'd been producing secret sadomasochistic art\nand stories without labeling what I was doing, but I stopped. I blockaded my thoughts of\nviolent power-play. I closed it all away as thoroughly as I could.\n\nI still felt sexual desire -- I mean, I was entering my teens, so of course I did. Sometimes I\nfelt so much desire, like in the middle of some inconvenient class, that I'd have to rest my\nburning forehead on the cold desk. I would close my eyes, and breathe deeply, and wait\nfor the erotic shiver to pass. At home, I'd lie around my twin bed and dream about kisses;\nimagine men's hair and skin and touch.\n\nYet it was hard for me to trace my desire, to take control of it. I thought I had no problem\nwith the idea of masturbation, but when I touched my own lady bits, I went cold.\nVibrators did nothing but bore me.\n\nI had excellent sex education, thank goodness. I went through a Unitarian Universalist\nsex education program that talked carefully about different experiences, that made space\nfor gay and lesbian and bisexual and transgender and queer folks. I didn't only learn\nabout sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy and condom usage; I was also\nencouraged to explore my sexuality, to value it. But this marvelous curriculum did not\ninclude BDSM and other non-standard sexual identities. Nor did it include much advice\non how to negotiate sexual encounters with my partners.
