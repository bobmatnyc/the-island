  "text": "16\n\nSinai, said that the fliers had been distributed outside mosques after\nFriday prayers by men who covered their faces with scarves.\n\nSeveral days later, another purported al Qaeda flier appeared around\nel-Arish -- this time announcing that the organization was planning to\nattack police stations on Aug. 12. For the Egyptian security services,\nthat was one provocation too far. On that day, stunned residents of el-\nArish woke to find thousands of troops from the Egyptian 2nd Army,\naccompanied by police officers and border guards, deployed in an\n\"anti-terror\" crackdown in Sinai. The operation's first phase entailed\nsecuring government buildings, police stations, and the el-Arish\nprison. The offensive started on Aug. 15, as one Egyptian militant\nwas killed and 12 were arrested, according Hazem al-Maadawi, a\npolice officer involved in the operation. State news agency EgyNews\nsaid authorities are targeting 15 more people who participated in\nattacks at the el-Arish police station, including members of the al\nQaeda-affiliated Palestinian group Jaish al-Islam. These extremist\nrumblings have frayed nerves in the Israeli government, which had\nalready been skeptical of the Egyptian revolution. Israeli Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu told a Knesset committee on May. 30,\n\"Global terrorist organizations are meddling [in Sinai] and their\npresence is increasing because of the connection between Sinai and\nGaza.\" If there is any hope of restoring order to Sinai, it lies in a\nhistoric rapprochement between the Bedouins and the Egyptian\nsecurity forces to drive out these unwanted interlopers. Bedouins\nhave signaled their willingness to help restore security, but are also\ncalling on the Egyptian government to do its part by finally\nintegrating them into Egypt's social fabric. \"We will not let a single\nPalestinian suspected of ill intentions into Sinai after the attacks,\"\nsaid Muhammed al-Ahmar, a Bedouin and human rights activist.\n\"But, we are fed up with empty promises, and if the police mentality\ndoes not change, then nothing will work. It's time for Sinai to flourish\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024607",
