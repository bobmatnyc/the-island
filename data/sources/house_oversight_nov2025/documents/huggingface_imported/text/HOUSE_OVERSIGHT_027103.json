  "text": "their enriched uranium outside Iran. Western analysts were confident that\nMr. Khamenei would give his blessing, given the international pressure he\nwas said to be under following the fraudulent elections and the bloody\ncrackdown that followed.\n\nThe Ayatollah quashed that deal too: \"Whenever they [Americans] smile\nat the officials of the Islamic revolution, when we carefully look at the\nsituation, we notice that they are hiding a dagger behind their back.\"\n\nIt was the same in January 2011, when diplomacy also collapsed. Ditto in\n2012, when negotiations in February, May and June each ended in failure.\nWashington went into those talks thinking they were going to succeed on\nthe theory that Tehran desperately wants relief from the supposedly\ncrippling pressure of economic sanctions.\n\nWhy does the Ayatollah keep saying no? The conventional wisdom is that\nprevious U.S. offers weren't generous enough, or that the wrong President\nwas in the White House, or that Iran wants only to deal directly with the\nU.S. and not in multilateral forums. Each of these theories has been tested\nand shown to be false.\n\nA more persuasive explanation—get ready for this shocker—is that Iran\nreally wants a bomb. The regime believes, not unreasonably, that\nMoammar Gadhafi would still be in power had he not given up his nuclear\nprogram in 2003. Mr. Khamenei also fears a \"velvet revolution\" scenario,\nin which more normal ties with the West threaten the ideological\nfoundations of the Islamic Republic. Confrontation with America is in this\nregime's DNA.\n\nMeantime, the pretense of negotiations has allowed Tehran to play for\ntime to advance its programs. When Mr. Obama took office, Iran had\nenriched 1,000 kilos of reactor-grade uranium. In its last report from\nNovember, U.N. inspectors found that Iran has produced 7,611 kilos to\nreactor grade, along with 232 kilos of uranium enriched to 20%, which is\nclose to bomb-grade. Last month, Iran declared that it would install 3,000\nadvanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility, which can enrich uranium at\ntwo to three times its current rate.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027103",
