  "text": "actions that imply particular timing\npatterns such as synchrony or rhythmic\nturn taking such as applauding in unison\nor the ‘wave’ that is produced by\nthousands of individual sports fans in a\nstadium. A model to explain such\nsynchronized behavior is proposed in\nterms of the neural processes that are\njointly recruited. One of the main\nimplications suggested by this model is\nthat taking part in or being part of a\nsynchronized social interaction gives rise\nto a qualitative shift in subjective\nexperience due to the difficulty of\napplying an individual centered\nexplanation to collectively produced\nspontaneous co-action.\n\nYou and I as One\n\n7. Action at a Distance: The Invisible\n\nForce of Language\nLanguage forms the fabric of our social\ninstitutions and makes tangible the nature\nof our relationships. Although the\nfunction of language 1s typically viewed\nin terms of the information content that it\nprovides, some of the social function of\nlanguage may depend on the way it\naffects us. The idea of language impact\n— how language directly affects our\nemotions and social connections — may\nbe fundamental to the way the social\nbrain functions to connect people.\n\nSystems and Signals for Social\nCoordination\n\n8. Hidden Forces in Understanding\nOthers: Mirror Neurons and\nNeurobiological Underpinnings\n\nSpecific brain regions in the monkey\ncontain individual brain cells, or neurons,\nthat respond to both observation and\nexecution of identical hand and mouth\nactions. Brain imaging in humans has\ndemonstrated that our brains have\nsimilarly localized regions with similar\nproperties. These areas respond to\nexecution of goal-directed actions of the\nhand and mouth and during observation\n\nof the same or similar actions.\nInterestingly, these brain regions in the\nhuman are also responsive to observation\nand imitation of facial movements, and\nappear to be sensitive to their emotional\ncontent.\n\nConnecting and Binding Social Brains\nand Minds\n\n9. Empathy and Interpersonal Sensitivity\nEmpathy is thought to play a key role in\nmotivating prosocial behavior, guiding\nour preferences and behavioral\nresponses, and providing the affective\nand motivational base for moral\ndevelopment. While folk conceptions of\nempathy view it as the capacity to share,\nunderstand and respond with care to the\naffective states of others, neuroscience\nresearch demonstrates that these\ncomponents can be dissociated. Empathy\nis not a unique characteristic of human\nconsciousness, but it is an important\nadaptive behavior that evolved with the\nmammalian brain. However, humans are\nspecial in the sense that high-level\ncognitive abilities (language, theory of\nmind, executive functions) are layered on\ntop of phylogenetically older social and\nemotional capacities. These higher level\ncognitive and social capacities expand\nthe range of behaviors that can be driven\nby empathy.\n\nSeeing into My Mind and Other Minds\n\n10. Seeing Invisible Minds\nOther minds are inherently invisible.\nBeing able to \"see\" them requires\nlearning about other minds, attending to\nother minds, and projecting one’s own\nmind onto others, and seeing minds in\nother agents can mean the difference\nbetween treating others as humans versus\nas objects.\n\nInferring Minds When None Can be\nSeen\n\n11.
