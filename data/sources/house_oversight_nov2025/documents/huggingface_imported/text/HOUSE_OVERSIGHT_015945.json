  "text": "not to be, certain of finding the proof, you would need to run a computer\nlong enough to calculate all the possible proofs up to the length of Wiles’\nsolution. Currently, a computer using every particle in the Universe\nclocked at the Plank interval — the fastest conceivable computer running\nat 10° operations per second — would take 10°” times the age of the\nknown Universe to do this. If someone tells you this is astronomically\nunlikely they are making a huge understatement. A computer running\nuntil the end-of-time would only scratch the surface.\n\nThe second flaw is even more damning. Even if the monkeys\nsucceeded in generating something interesting, something else needs to\nspot this. If an algorithm stumbled upon a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem,\nwhat would recognize it as such? There are no ways to systematically\nanalyze proofs. There are no mechanical methods that understand these.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015945",
