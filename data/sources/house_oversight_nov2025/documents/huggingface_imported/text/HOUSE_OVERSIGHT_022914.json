  "text": "dictators or military strongmen. Then, in his telling, he\nwas representing a series of vastly wealthy people and\nfamilies—not just doing their bidding or their investing,\nbut helping them to navigate the ambitions of their\nwealth. If they had big dreams before, it’s nothing to\nwhat they can have now.\n\nIf early in his career he might have seemed like a\nsort of George Peppard (there’s a physical resemblance)\nin Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s\nGeorge Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.\nAt just about this point in the narrative, the\nincredulity about Epstein began to circulate in social\ncircles. Epstein had acquired the major symbols of\nwealth but without position, public holdings, or\nobvious paper trails. His is a questionable substrata of\nwealth, without institutional credentials or bona fides.\nHe’s a freelancer. That’s the rub: he doesn’t work for\nanyone.\n\nThere is no clear alternate narrative, except perhaps\nguilt by association. (In addition to Robert Maxwell,\nwho will be accused of fraud, there’s Steven\nHoffenberg, briefly a New York high flyer, who went to\njail for a Ponzi scheme, for whom Epstein acted as a\nconsultant—along with, he points out, Paul Volcker.)\nBut the characterization persists: if it’s not clear, it must\nbe murky. Sure, Goldman Sachs partners and tech\ngeniuses, they might have stratospheric wealth, but what\nto make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like no-namer?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022914",
