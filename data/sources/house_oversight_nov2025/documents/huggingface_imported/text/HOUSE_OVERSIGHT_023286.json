  "text": "funds), but that a commercial exchange agent gave us less comfort on the sales\ntax side. Leon did not want to use a gallery because he was concerned about\nconfidentiality and he did not want to have to ask a gallery that he did not do\nmuch business with to act as exchange agent.\n\nWhen Leon first discussed the exchange for the Cezannes with me a few\nweeks ago, | asked him if he wanted to use the same exchange agent as last\nyear, or if he wanted to use a gallery. | said that a gallery carried little to no risk\non the sales tax side, but | reminded him that he had not wanted to use a gallery\nlast year for the Calder because of confidentiality reasons. He said to use the\nsame exchange agent as before, which made sense to me because he was\nextremely concerned about confidentiality with the purchase of the Cezannes.\n\n| will find out about sales tax audits and will let you know. The exchange agent\nhas had a New York resale certificate since 2014 and has been engaged in art\ntransactions like this since then, but | do not believe they have been audited. |\nwill check, though, and | will also ask the Herrick lawyer if any of his clients who\nhave done similar deals have been audited.\n\nBest,\n\nHeather\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023286",
