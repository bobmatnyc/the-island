[Vol. 104\n\nsystem.” It extended broad rights to crime victims, including “[t]he right\nto be treated with faimess and with respect for the victim’s dignity and\nprivacy”” and “[t]he reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the\nGovernment in the case.”*° It also commanded that these rights must be\nafforded by the Justice Department “and other departments and agencies of\nthe United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of\ncrime.”?’.

They were kept in the dark\nby prosecutors to[o] busy to care enough, by judges focused on [defendants’] rights,\nand by a court system that simply did not have a place for them.*!\n\nIn passing the CVRA, Congress sought to change the system’s\nobliviousness to crime victims that often “left crime victims and their\nfamilies victimized yet again.”*\n\nA second overarching purpose of the CVRA was to allow crime\nvictims to play a role in the criminal justice process. Through the CVRA,\nCongress intended to make victims “independent participant[s]” in the\ncriminal justice process.** The CVRA extends to crime victims a series of\n“rights” in the criminal justice process—rights that the victims have\n\n*4 150 Conc.
