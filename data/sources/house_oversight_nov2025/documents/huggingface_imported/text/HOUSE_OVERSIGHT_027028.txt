Obama nominee Penny Pritzker's $80 million mistake

President Obama's billionaire nominee to head the Commerce Department, Penny Prizker, understated her
income by $80 million.

Hey, these things happen: Penny Pritzker, President Obama's nominee to lead the Commerce Department,
understated her income by some $80 million and had to file a correction to her government-filed
disclosures, Bloomberg is reporting.

That might sound like a lot of money, but it's all relative. Pritzker, whose family founded the Hyatt
hotel chain, is worth about $1.5 billion. So it's easy to see how a few million - or 80 — could go
missing.

Maybe she left it in the other purse?

A spokeswoman told Bloomberg that the $80 million was “a substantial amount" and that Pritzker's advisers
corrected the error as soon as they realized it.

Per Bloomberg: "Documents released last week show Pritzker received $32.2 million for a decade's worth of
consulting on the restructuring of domestic trusts," but new filings indicated she made at least $80
million more than that.
