  "text": "The three men — Alexei Ananenko (second left) and soldiers Valeri Bezpalov (center) and Boris Baranov (far right) —\nrisked their lives o drain the fluid near the reactor during the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in Pripyat, Ukraine in 1986.\nAfter the plant’s water-cooling system failed and a pool formed under the reactor 10 days into the disaster, there was a\nhigh risk that the lava-like radioactive substance could melt through the barriers and drop the reactor’s core into said\n\npool, causing a steam explosion. Luckily, the men were able to drain the fluid and spectacularly, all three survived.\n\n#3 Cher Ami\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020668",
