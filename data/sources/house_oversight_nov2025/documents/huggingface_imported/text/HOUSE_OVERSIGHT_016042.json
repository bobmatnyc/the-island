  "text": "352 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nThis Universe could be preprogrammed with every theory we could\never discover within it. (There would be no arbitrary problems.)\n\nThis argument neatly sidesteps Turing’s theorem by specifying\nthere is no such thing as an arbitrary problem - a random problem\npicked from the infinite set of problems. At the same time, it sets certain\ncharacteristics of such a Universe and I believe we can test these...\n\nA computable Universe must already know the solution to every\nproblem it will encounter above the logic limit: It cannot discover\nknowledge on the fly. For many problems, a small number of fundamental\nrules can account for everything. Although our galaxy and the beautiful\nnebulae we see through our telescopes look complex, they might be\nthe result of some such simple set of rules — just like a fractal. That’s\nStephen Wolfram’s solution to the mystery of our Universe. But some\nproblems are complex. The solution to Fermat’s Last Theorem is an 80\npage document consisting of 5 million bits of information. All this must\nbe stored somewhere in the Universe. It might not be stored as a string\nof bytes, it could be found in a set of equations governing the motion of\nthe atoms such that at some point — in 1995 to be exact — they all line\nup in Andrew Wiles’ brain to direct his fingers to type out the proof. In\nthis case, the Universe has solved a mathematical puzzle because it was\nspecifically set up to do so from the time of the Big Bang, but this raises\nthree questions:\n\nWhere does the Universe store this enormous amount of\ninformation?\n\nHow does The Universe hold the information reliably?\n\nHow did the pre-Universe solve the problem, so it might program\nthe Universe at the moment of the Big Bang?\n\nThe first question is probably answerable. The Universe is a big place\nand could store sufficient information to solve the mysteries that puzzle\nthe inquisitive creatures that inhabit its planes. There are many practical\nproblems to consider, such as how to preserve the information through\nall the strange evolutions of our Universe; inflation, star formation, and\nso on. But it could be done.\n\nThe second question is insurmountable and presents the counter\nargument to the determinists. Our Universe appears to be composed of\nnon-deterministic objects. Such objects exist in the mathematical world;\nKochen-Specker cubes, for example. Unfortunately for the determined\ndeterminist, bosons behave according to the same principles. In case\nyou're thinking thinking bosons are rare, light is formed of bosons. Our\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016042",
