  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nClaus Von Bulow\n\nAfter we won the case, Claus and his then girlfriend decided to host a dinner party. I told them I\nwould not come if it was a victory party, since I have a policy of not going to victory parties of\ncriminal defendants. He assured me that it was merely a dinner for several interesting people. He\ntold me among his other guests would be the novelist Norman Mailer and his wife. When the\ndinner began, Claus regaled everybody with stories from the trial and I explained why the\nevidence seemed to point to his innocence. About halfway through the dinner, Mailer grabbed his\nwife’s arm and said, “Let’s get out of here. I think this guy is innocent. I thought we were going\nto be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring.” In fact, many\nof my most exciting cases involved very boring people, though Claus was not one of them. When\nthe movie came out, Claus refused to go to see it insisting that he would never watch Jeremy\nIrons play him. Several months later I was having lunch with Claus and his most recent girlfriend\nwho I had never previously met. After about an hour of conversation with me, she turned to\nClaus and said, “Now that I’ve met Alan I believe that Ron Silver really didn’t do him justice. He\noverplayed him.” Claus immediately shook his head in agreement saying, “You’re right my dear,\nI too think he overplayed him.” This from a man who claimed he didn’t see the film.\n\n392\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017479",
