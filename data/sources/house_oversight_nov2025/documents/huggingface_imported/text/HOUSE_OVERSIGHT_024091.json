  "text": "If it were ultimately established that the Fund is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, the Fund\ngenerally would be required to withhold and remit to the U.S. government a percentage of the\nFund’s net income and gains that are both effectively connected with that trade or business and\nallocated to Non-U.S. Partners, and would be liable for interest and penalties with respect to\namounts which were not so withheld. The relevant withholding percentage is the maximum\nU.S. federal income tax rate for individuals or corporations, as applicable. In addition, Non-U.S.\nPartners generally would be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and pay tax in\nrespect of their shares of the Fund’s effectively connected income including capital gains, but\nwould be allowed a credit against U.S. federal income tax liability for amounts withheld by the\nFund on their behalf. Non-U.S. Partners which are non-U.S. corporations might also be subject\nto a “branch profits” tax on certain earnings of the Fund deemed to have been repatriated to\nthose Partners.\n\nTreatment of Interest and Dividends from U.S. Sources - Certain categories of investment\nincome from U.S. sources realized by the Fund, such as dividends and interest, generally will be\nsubject to U.S. income tax withholding, at a 30% rate on the gross amount of that income, when\nincluded in the distributive shares of Non-U.S. Partners. A Non-U.S. Partner whose distributive\nshare of such income is subject to U.S. withholding tax may be able to claim an exemption or a\nreduced rate of withholding under a tax treaty or convention between the U.S. and that\nPartner's country of residence by providing appropriate documentation regarding that\nPartner’s residence for tax purposes and its satisfaction of any conditions imposed by the treaty.\nA Non-U.S. Partner resident in a jurisdiction with which the U.S. has a tax treaty, however, will\nnot be entitled to the benefits of that treaty with respect to that Non-U.S. Partner’s distributive\nshare of the Fund’s income and gains unless the Fund is treated as fiscally transparent under\nthe law of that non-US. jurisdiction and certain other conditions are satisfied. Finally, in order\nto claim the benefits of a tax treaty to reduce U.S. withholding tax on U.S.-source interest and\ndividends paid by corporations that are not actively traded, a Non-U.S. Partner — and any\ndirect or indirect equity owner of a Non-U.S. Partner seeking treaty benefits for itself because\nthe Non-U.S. Partner is considered fiscally transparent in that equity owner’s jurisdiction —\ngenerally will be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number from the IRS and may\nbe required to provide that number and certain other documentation to the Fund. Other\nexemptions may be available for certain types of interest income.\n\nTreatment of the Fund’s Capital Gains from U.S. Sources - Under current U.S. law, in general,\ncapital gains attributable to sales by the Fund of the securities of U.S. corporations will not be\nsubject to U.S. federal income taxation or tax withholding when allocated to a Non-U.5. Partner\nunless that Partner is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the\ntaxable year in which such gains are realized and certain other conditions are satisfied.\n\nThis general rule does not apply to gains attributable to a U.S. trade or business or gains\nattributable to dispositions of securities of any “United States real property holding\ncorporation” (“USRPHC”), defined in Section 897 of the Code as, in general, a company with\n50% or more of the fair market value of its business assets consisting of interests in U.S. real\nestate and related assets. Capital gains attributable to sales by the Fund of the securities of a\nU.S. corporation that is a USRPHC (other than debt securities with no equity component) may\nbe subject to U.S. income tax, collected initially by withholding, to the extent allocated to any\nNon-U.S. Partner. Non-U.S. Partners would also be required to file U.S. federal income tax\n\n80 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024091",
