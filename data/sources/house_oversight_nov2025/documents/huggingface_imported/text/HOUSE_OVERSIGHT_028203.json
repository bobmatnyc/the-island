I told our team we\ncould not play that game. Until there was at least some movement from Arafat, I\ndidn’t want them suggesting any Israeli concessions. We’d obviously get nothing\nin return. The summit would fail. Despite my repeated insistence both to the\nAmericans and Palestinians that, without an agreement, any Israeli suggestions\nwould be null and void, that didn’t mean they would simply be forgotten. The\nresult is that we’d actually be in a worse situation than before Camp David.\nPolitically, I’d find myself in much the same position as President Assad, after the\nleak of the American draft from Shepherdstown: apparently ready to consider\ngiving Arafat the great majority of the West Bank, without the slightest sign Arafat\nwas ready for a full and final peace. But that wasn’t my main concern. It was that\nanything that we put on the table here would handcuff future Israeli governments if\nand when an “end of conflict” agreement became possible.\n\nStill, when Dennis Ross learned from my negotiators what I’d decided, he was\nfrustrated and upset. He came to see me on Saturday morning — day-five of what\nwas looking increasingly like a stillborn summit. “This summit was your idea,” he\nsaid, reminding me that the President had agreed to it over the reservations of a lot\nhis own aides. He told me that at a minimum, I| had to help give it a chance: by\ngiving him my true negotiating “red lines.” Either that, or give my negotiators\nmore leeway to explore compromises. I did not want to make Dennis’s job any\nmore difficult than it already was. And I told him I was still ready to engage fully\nif we ever got to the real substance of a possible deal. “But I can’t do what you’ve\nasked me,” I replied. “Not when Arafat is simply holding firm and not showing a\nwillingness even to ook for compromises.”\n\nFortunately for my relationship with the President — though not for the\nprospects of an agreement — Clinton had considerably more sympathy with my\nposition after his next meeting with both sets of negotiators that afternoon. It was a\nreturn encounter with Abu Ala’a on territory and borders. Shlomo Ben-Ami now\nproduced a map of the West Bank with our proposed breakdown into the areas that\nwould be controlled by a Palestinian state, the part Israel would retain to\naccommodate the major settlements, and territory which we suggested would go to\n\n355\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028203",
