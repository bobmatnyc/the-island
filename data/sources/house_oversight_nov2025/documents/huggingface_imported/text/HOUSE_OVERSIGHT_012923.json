  "text": "1.6 Potential Approaches to AGI 7\n\nlikely to come about for a decade or two. So to do brain-emulation AGI seriously, one needs to\nwait a while until brain scanning technology improves.\n\nCurrent AI methods like neural nets that are loosely based on the brain, are really not brain-\nlike enough to make a serious claim at emulating the brain’s approach to general intelligence.\nWe don’t yet have any real understanding of how the brain represents abstract knowledge, for\nexample, or how it does reasoning (though the authors, like many others, have made some\nspeculations in this regard [GMIH08]).\n\nAnother problem with this approach is that once you’re done, what you get is something\nwith a very humanlike mind, and we already have enough of those! However, this is perhaps\nnot such a serious objection, because a digital-computer-based version of a human mind could\nbe studied much more thoroughly than a biology-based human mind. We could observe its\ndynamics in real-time in perfect precision, and could then learn things that would allow us to\nbuild other sorts of digital minds.\n\n1.6.4 Evolve an AGI\n\nAnother approach is to try to run an evolutionary process inside the computer, and wait for\nadvanced AGI to evolve.\n\nOne problem with this is that we don’t know how evolution works all that well. There’s a\nfield of artificial life, but so far its results have been fairly disappointing. It’s not yet clear how\nmuch one can vary on the chemical structures that underly real biology, and still get powerful\nevolution like we see in real biology. If we need good artificial chemistry to get good artificial\nbiology, then do we need good artificial physics to get good artificial chemistry?\n\nAnother problem with this approach, of course, is that it might take a really long time.\nEvolution took billions of years on Earth, using a massive amount of computational power. To\nmake the evolutionary approach to AGI effective, one would need some radical innovations to\nthe evolutionary process (such as, perhaps, using probabilistic methods like BOA [Pel05] or\nMOSES [Loo06] in place of traditional evolution).\n\n1.6.5 Derwe an AGI design mathematically\n\nOne can try to use the mathematical theory of intelligence to figure out how to make advanced\nAGI.\n\nThis interests us greatly, but there’s a huge gap between the rigorous math of intelligence\nas it exists today and anything of practical value. As we'll discuss in Chapter 7, most of the\nrigorous math of intelligence right now is about how to make AI on computers with dramati-\ncally unrealistic amounts of memory or processing power. When one tries to create a theoretical\nunderstanding of real-world general intelligence, one arrives at quite different sorts of consider-\nations, as we will roughly outline in Chapter 10. Ideally we would like to be able to study the\nCogPrime design using a rigorous mathematical theory of real-world general intelligence, but at\nthe moment that’s not realistic. The best we can do is to conceptually analyze CogPrime and\nits various components in terms of relevant mathematical and theoretical ideas; and perform\nanalysis of CogPrime’s individual structures and components at varying levels of rigor.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012923",
