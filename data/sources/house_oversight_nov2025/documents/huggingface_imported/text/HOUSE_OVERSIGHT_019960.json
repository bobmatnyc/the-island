  "text": "were two contradictory theories here: he had hidden these dealings because he didn’t want\nto admit their paucity, or he had hidden them to mask their disreputableness.) Because\nTrump is less than creditworthy, Foer was among many who concluded that Trump needed\nto turn to other sources—more or less dirty money, or money with other sorts of strings\nattached. (One way the process can work is, roughly speaking, as follows: an oligarch\nmakes an investment in a more or less legitimate third-party investment fund, which, quid\npro quo, makes an investment in Trump.) And while Trump would categorically deny that\nhe had any loans or investments from Russia, one would, of course, not have dirty money\non one’s books.\n\nAs a subset of this theory, Trump—never very scrupulous about vetting his people—\nsurrounded himself with a variety of hustlers working their own deals, and, plausibly,\naiding Trump’s deals. Foer identified the following characters as part of a possible Russian\nconspiracy:\n\n¢ Tevfik Arif, a former Rus sian official who ran the Bayrock Group, a middleman in\nTrump financings with an office in Trump Tower.\n\n¢ Felix Sater (sometimes spelled Satter), a Russian-born immigrant to Brighton Beach\nin Brooklyn, who had previously served time in prison in connection with a fraud at\na Mafia-run brokerage and who went to work for Bayrock and had a business card\nidentifying him as senior adviser to Donald Trump. (When Sater’s name later\ncontinued to surface, Trump assured Bannon he didn’t know Sater at all.)\n\n* Carter Page, a banker of uncertain portfolio who had spent time in Russia and billed\nhimself as having advised the state-run oil company, Gazprom, and who showed up\non a hastily assembled list of Trump foreign policy advisers and who, it would turn\nout, the FBI was closely monitoring in what it said was a Russian intelligence effort\nto turn him. (Trump would later deny ever meeting Page, and the FBI would say that\nit believed Russian intelligence had targeted Page in an effort to turn him.)\n\n¢ Michael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency—fired by\nObama for unclear reasons—who had yet to emerge as Trump’s key foreign policy\ncounselor and future National Security Advisor, but who was accompanying him on\nmany campaign trips and who earlier in the year had been paid a $45,000 speaking\nfee in Moscow and been photographed sitting at a dinner with Putin.\n\n¢ Paul Manafort, whom, along with serving as Trump’s campaign manager, Foer\nhighlighted as a political operative and consultant who had generated substantial\nincome advising Kremlin-backed Viktor Yanukovych, who successfully ran for the\npresidency of Ukraine in 2010, was later deposed in 2014, and had been in business\nwith the Russian oligarch and Putin crony Oleg Deripaska.\n\nMore than a year later, each of these men would be part of the near-daily Russia-Trump\nnews cycle.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019960",
