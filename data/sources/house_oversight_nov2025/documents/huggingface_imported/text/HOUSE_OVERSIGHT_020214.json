He was earning from Dell\njust over $120,000 a year. His housing allowance from Dell paid the rent on his 1,559 square-\nfoot house. He had also leased a sporty car. Looking back at this period of life from Moscow,\nhe said he had been “living in paradise.”\n\nHe went to work five times a week, a 15 minute trip drive through a lush landscape with sugar\nplantations. After passing through security, he parked his car in a sprawling parking lot, and\nentered the underground part of the NSA base known as “the tunnel.” He said in describing the\natmosphere, “You’re in a vaulted space. Everybody has sort of similar clearances, everybody\nknows everybody. It’s a small world.” He said that to relieve the tediousness of the work, every\ntwo months or so his fellow workers would pass around a naked picture that showed up on their\nscreens. He explained: “You've got young enlisted guys, 18 to 22 years old [who] suddenly been\nthrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility where they now have access to all of your\nprivate records. In the course of their daily work they stumble across ... an intimate nude photo\nof someone in a sexually compromising position.” Snowden, as will be recalled, was no stranger\nto posting lewd photographs. Before he joined the CIA, he had posted pictures of himself\nmooning on the Internet. He also knew that copying any files, including photographs, was a\nviolation of NSA rules. But he did not report this illicit activity at the NSA even though he later\nclaimed that it occurred regularly. He joked in his Moscow interview with the Guardian that\nsome of the nudes were “extremely attractive” and that viewing them was, as he put it, “a sort of\nthe fringe benefits of surveillance positions.”\n\nSnowden also had an interest in American politics. He identified with the Libertarian Party, and\nat the NSA he made no effort to conceal his political support of its causes. He became an active\npartisan of Congressman Ron Paul, the leading figure in the Libertarian Party in 2012. “He's so\ndreamy,” Snowden posted on the Ars Technica site in March 2009 (just after he registered to\nvote in North Carolina.) Since Paul was running as a Presidential candidate in the 2012\nRepublican primaries, Snowden sent the Paul election committee a contribution of $500.\nSnowden’s attraction to the Libertarian ideology of Ron Paul was not that surprising. At the core\nof Paul’s libertarianism was a deep hostility to the intrusion of the government into private lives.\nSnowden shared this same hostility towards government authority, as was clear from his Internet\npostings. Like other libertarians, Snowden believed that citizens should not be shackled by\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020214",
