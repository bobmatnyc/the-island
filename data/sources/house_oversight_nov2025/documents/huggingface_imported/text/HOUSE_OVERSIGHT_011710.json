  "text": "fully detailed picture of the progress of the SAS action, skeptics and hawks in\nthe cabinet were inclined to see a glass half-empty. They continued to press for\nIsraeli military action.\n\nIn a rare public statement, I tried to reassure the country we did have a\nmilitary option, but also to urge restraint. I pointed out that the number of Scuds\nhad begun decreasing. Though the threat had not been eliminated altogether, we\nhad “very good operational plans” that would be “carried out when and if the\nIsraeli government instructs us to implement them.” Yet I added a caveat. “On\nthe political level, fingers are itching to carry out operations which, in our\nopinion, can remove the threat. But in the complex situation created by this war,\nneither anger, hurt, nor itchy fingers can replace rational thinking.”\n\nThe American ground invasion did turn out to be swift and decisive. In\nIsrael, Scud attacks continued for a few more days. But the last two missiles fell\nin the Negev before dawn on February 25, among the very few to cause neither\ncasualties nor damage. We turned out to have been right in our pre-war\nassessment about the number of missiles: around 40. Fortunately, the casualties\nwere far fewer than we’d anticipated. Not 120 dead, but fifteen, only one of\nwhom died directly because of a missile blast. The other deaths were the result\nof understandable panic: the misuse of gas masks or the gas antidote drug\natropine, or from respiratory and cardiac failure. The physical damage,\nhowever, was far greater than I’d anticipated. Buildings were destroyed. Cars\nwere crushed. Glass and debris flew everywhere. In financial terms, the cost ran\nto hundreds of millions of dollars. The true impact was greater: on families who\nsaw the destruction not only their homes, but a lifetime of prized possessions.\nFor Holocaust survivors in particular, there was the almost unimaginable terror\nof having to huddle in sealed rooms for fear of gas. And all Israelis had\nexperienced a new sense of vulnerability to a faraway enemy whom they\ncouldn’t see nor, apparently, stop.\n\nI was due to become Israel’s 14\" chief-of-staff at the start of April, barely a\nmonth after the last Scud attack. As the handover drew nearer, I felt fortunate,\nin a way, to have missed out on the job four years earlier. Not only had Dan\nexcelled as ramatkal. I'd benefited from his range of experience, his judgment,\nand his trust as well. We had worked together truly as a team.\n\n239\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011710",
