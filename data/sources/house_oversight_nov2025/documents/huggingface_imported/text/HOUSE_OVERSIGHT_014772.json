We highlight four such opportunities in this\nsection, specifically: 1) US deregulation; 2) return of Euro zone risk premia; 3) China-\nlinked commodity prices weakening sharply; and 4) Japan’s yield curve targeting\ntriggering a steeper curve and volatility increase.\n\nChart 72: Biggest tail-risk, percentage of respondents in Global Fund Manager Survey\n\nOct-16 EU disintegration : a\nSep-16 Republican wins White House Global FMS biggest “tail risk\nAug-16 Republican wins White House (past 12 months)\n\nJul-16 Republican wins White House\nJun-16 | Brexit\nMay-16 Brexit\nApr-16 Quantitative Failure\nMar-16 | Quantitative Failure\nFeb-16 US recession\nJan-16 China recession\nDec-15 China recession\nNov-15 China recession\nOct-15 China recession\n\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nTail risk 1: US deregulation\n\nNormalized swap spreads, cross-currency basis & coupon vs principal STRIPS\nDeregulation is a key focus for the incoming administration, and Dodd-Frank is a major\npotential target.
