Whereas, | am ashamed to\nadmit, we were trying to prolong it.\n\nAnna Chennault—the Dragon Lady, as we called her—was our\nliaison to South Vietnamese government officials. Her task was to dissuade\ntheir ambassador to the U.S, Bui Diem, from attending the Paris peace\ntalks.\n\nBut LBJ got wise to this. | had to call and cajole him personally. He\nwas absolutely furious. He complained bitterly at how “shit-kickin’\npissed off” he was. “Thieu is our boy,” he shouted, “and don’ t you\nfuckin’ forget that!”\n\nOn November 1, 1968, only four days before the American election,\nPresident Nguyen Van Thieu announced that Saigon was pulling out of the\npeace talks. The Dragon Lady had obviously convinced his associates that\nthey would obtain a juicier deal under our new administration than under\nJohnson or his chosen successor, Hubert Humphrey, who would surely\nhave won if the Democrats had ended the war.\n\nAnd so, because it was in the mutual interest of the South\n\nVietnamese and the Republicans to extend the war for several more years,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015105",
