  "text": "In May 2006, Recarey drew up probable cause affidavits, charging Epstein, two of\nhis assistants and one recruiter with sex-related crimes. Instead, Krischer took\nwhat Recarey said was the unusual step of referring the case to a state grand jury.\nEpstein was indicted in state court on a minor charge of solicitation of\nprostitution.\n\nRecarey said Krischer told him he didn’t believe Epstein’s accusers, and only two\nof them were called before the state grand jury investigating the case — even\nthough police had lined up more than a dozen girls and witnesses at that time.\n\nBelieving that the case had been tainted, Reiter — that same month, May 2006 —\ntook a very public stance against Krischer, writing a letter, which was released to\nthe news media, calling on Krischer to remove himself from the case. The chief\nthen referred it to the FBI, which opened its own investigation in July 2006, FBI\nrecords show.\n\nReiter said he was effectively blackballed in some Palm Beach circles as a result\nof going over Krischer’s head, and their relationship, once strong, would never be\nthe same.\n\nReiter has no regrets about what he did.\n\n“There are challenges here that don’t exist in a lot of other places because of the\naffluence in the community, but the only way I could approach this case was that\nnone of that matters. The truth is still the truth. The facts are the facts.\nEverybody is treated the same.”\n\nIn the years that followed, several of the victims obtained lawyers and filed civil\nlawsuits against Epstein. About two dozen lawsuits were filed, starting in 2008.\nThe early cases were particularly brutal for his victims, the court records show.\n\nThe girls faced fierce grilling from another pack of Epstein’s civil attorneys, who\nquestioned them about their boyfriends, drinking, drug use, social media posts,\ntheir parents and even their medical histories.\n\nOne girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016443",
