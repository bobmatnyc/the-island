I am using that \nclip in my Talent & Creativity class when we discuss \"Creativity & Psychopathology.\" In Psychiatry, the formal \nterms that apply are \"flight of ideas,\" \"pressured speech,\" \"delusions of grandeur,\", and \"clang associations.\" A \ntruly great example of Hypomania. There's an interesting book on hypomania and success in America today. \nxxx \nMark Jude Tramo, MD PhD \nDept of Integrative Biology & Physiology, UCLA School of Letters & Science \nDept of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA \nDept of Musicology, UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music \nDirector, The Institute for Music & Brain Science \nCo-Director, University of California Multi-Campus Music Research Initiative (UC MERCI) \nhttp://www.BrainMusic.org \nhttp://merci.ucsd.edu \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029516",
