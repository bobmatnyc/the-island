The reason for the use of children in this barbaric way was to\nexpend \"ops\" that were already in effect and had been used to control many of the politicians that\nhave been allowed to rise to the top (see info on the Franklin Scandal for example), and similarly\naccording to the laws of compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly\ncoordinated murder \"ops\":\n\n(| write) \"The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through\nsources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to\nparticipate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading\nonly to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you\nsee below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf\nand what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics;\nand one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's\nto come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly\nsuspicious as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) “As a former homicide\ncommander, | am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,” William O. Ritchie, former\nhead of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also\nraised questions about the marshals’ actions: “How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post\nmortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did\nthe US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have\nsuggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest\npoisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.”\n\nAs for SAIC, the following also pertains:\n\n(| write) \"If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase),\nand also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and\nBen Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture:\n\n(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered\ninto joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011\nHillary Clinton State Department award (http://Awww.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-\na...);\n\n(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon\nthereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion\ndollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...);\n\n(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as\ncorrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite...
