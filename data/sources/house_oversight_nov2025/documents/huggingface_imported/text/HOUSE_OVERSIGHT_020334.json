They also had to list their foreign travel,\nfamily members, police encounters, mental health, and credit history. For good measure, Chinese\nhackers obtained the confidential medical histories of government employees by hacking into the\ncomputers of Anthem and other giant heath care companies. Ifthe Chinese intelligence services\nconsolidated the fruits of these hacking attacks it would have a searchable database of almost\neveryone working in the American defense and intelligence complex. From this database, it\ncould track individuals with high security clearances vulnerable to being bribed, blackmailed or\ntricked into cooperating. No one doubted that the Chinese would use their cyber capabilities to\ntake advantage of weaknesses in foreign computer systems. General Hayden said of the massive\ntheft of intelligence personnel records: “those records are a legitimate foreign intelligence target.”\nHe added, “If I, as director of the NSA or CIA would have had the opportunity to grab the\nequivalent in the Chinese system, I would not have thought twice.” If that opportunity did not\narise for the NSA or CIA during Hayden’s tenure, it may have been because no insider in the\nChinese intelligence services provided US intelligence with a road map to tt.\n\nCyber espionage was not the Chinese Intelligence Service only powerful resource in the\nintelligence war. To get both electronic intelligence and human intelligence about the United\nStates, China also had a highly-productive intelligence sharing treaty with Russia. It was signed\nin 1992 after the Soviet Union was dissolved. Although the terms of this exchange remain secret,\ndefectors from the Russian KGB and SVR reported that Chinese intelligence received from\nRussia a continuous stream of communication intelligence about the US in the late twentieth and\nearly twenty-first centuries. Russia’s intelligence resources during this period were formidable.\nThey included geo-synchronous satellites, listening stations in Cuba, sleeper agents and embassy-\nbased spy networks. Presumably, this relationship further deepened under President Putin’s\nregime. Putin asserted in his speeches in 2014 that Russia and China continue to share a key\nstrategic objective: countering the United States’ domination of international relations, or what\nPutin terms, “a unipolar world order.” China’s President Xi Jinping expressed a very similar\nview, saying in 2014 in a thinly-veiled reference to the United States, stating that any American\nattempt to “monopolize” international affairs will not succeed.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, Russia has been the major supplier of almost all of China’s\nmodern weaponry. It licenses for manufacture in China avionics, air defense systems, missile\nlaunchers, stealth technology, and submarine warfare equipment. To make these arms effective, it\nalso provides China with up-to-date intelligence about the ability of the United States and its allies\nto counter them. While such intelligence cooperation may be limited by the reality that China and\nRussia still compete in some areas, there is no reason to assume that they do not share the fruits\nof their cyber and conventional espionage against the NSA. After all, the NSA works to intercept\nthe military and political secrets of both these allies. Moreover, NSA secrets might are a form of\ncurrency in the global intelligence war.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020334",
