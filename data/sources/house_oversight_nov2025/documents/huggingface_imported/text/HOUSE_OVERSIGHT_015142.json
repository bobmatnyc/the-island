  "text": "didn’ ttell Netanyahu that she was just about to perform the same act on\nme while | was on the phone with Aim. Anyway, at that point, Monica\nfound a big old dusty Mason jar under my desk. There was a label on the\nside which read, “Property of Ronald Reagan.”\n\nThat Mason jar was filled with Teflon, and | have rubbed it on myself\nevery day since.\n\n| began my talk this morning with an epiphany, and |’ d like to end\nwith another. This epiphany also occurred while | was watching\ntelevision—Larry King Live—and, once again, Paula Jones was the guest. At\nOne point she said, “I'’ ve never voted in my life.” And | was astounded.\nThen she said, “I'’ m so apolitical, it’ s unreal.” And | realized what an\nincredibly great country America really is, that somebody who was just a\nplain citizen, who was never even /nterested in politics—somebody who\nhad never even voted for a president—had nearly succeeded in toppling\none.\n\nWell, this has been a catharsis for me. | just want to say once more\nhow much | appreciate your presence here. And finally | would like to share\nwith you a little witticism that Hillary came up with last night, an idea for\nwhat my epitaph should be: “Here lies Bill Clinton, but that depends on\n\nwhat you mean by lies.” Isn't she wonderful?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015142",
