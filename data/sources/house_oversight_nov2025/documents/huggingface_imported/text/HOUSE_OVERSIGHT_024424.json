  "text": "have distorted Islam. I call this the “Peaceful Muslim Disclaimer” as virtually everyone in the press and\ngovernment has been bullied into making some statement of the kind to silence those who will pressure them\nthat they are “Islamophobic” and Islam is being attacked. (These are the Islam hustlers who operate on the\nsame principles that black race hustlers so effectively used to extort concessions over the last six decades or\nSO).\n\nNobody has done any real work to support this proposition, nor is it clear exactly how it would be tested. My\nview is that the grammar “Islam is x” is itself problematic because Islam has expressed itself throughout\nhistory in a variety of fashions. It is more useful to talk in terms of how seriously engaged with Islam, the\nKoran and other texts, a Muslim is. What is significant is how Muslims today are using Islam and most of\nthose who are in power either throughout a large territory or within a small community tend toward, if not\nfully advocate, the very supremacist ideas that we try to tell ourselves are reserved for the\n\nfew ”extremists.” Presumably most Germans did not wish to see all Nazi atrocities carried out but in the end\nthey fell in line because they had to. Those our politicians and press call the “extremists” are in one sense\nmore accurately the “good” Muslims who ar e following their Islamic beliefs dutifully.\n\nFP: Tell us how Western shame and guilt play into all of this.\n\nSiegel: One of the dirty little secrets the Control Factor preys upon is that if we believe we control something\nwe can comfort ourselves that we can change it. Remember the horror film- the threat has one purpose and\nthat is to destroy you. You can not change it, talk it out of it, teach it alternatives or otherwise. That is what\nmakes it so inherently frightening. If we can convince ourselves that we caused the threat to act the way it\ndoes we can maintain the secret hope that we can change it. Consequently, there is a tremendous attraction to\nblaming ourselves for the Islamic Enemy’s behavior. And we see this power in our readily accepting\nresponsibility for terror- because of our occupation, our greedy quest for oil, our failure to extend a hand of\n“engagement,” Israel’s building settlements, our making videos that defa me Mohammed and so on. Again,\nthe relationship is defined by the enemy blaming us for his actions and our accepting such responsibility.\n\nShelby Steele has written brilliantly about what he calls “white guilt” and outlines how whites during the\n60's and thereafter were pressured into a transaction whereby in order to re-obtain a sense of moral authority\nthey accepted blame for the condition of blacks and behaved as if guilty. Blacks were able to extract great\nconcessions and whites were able to view themselves as morally restored and redeemed. At a certain point,\nhowever, the behavior takes on a life of its own and the narratives become deeply embedded in the culture\nand, as we can see today, difficult to uproot.\n\nWestern guilt is an extension of Steele’s notion. President Obama’s confessionals to the Arab world\nadmitting that America has made “‘mistakes” and was not born a colonial pow er express this same tendency\nto appease through guilt. Hillary Clint on’s “reset” with Russia conveyed the same submissive request for a\nmore acceptable response. In being guilty we presume the other party will recognize our contrition and\nrespond in like kind. One of the Control Factor’s most devastating moves is employed- presuming the other\nis just like us and will respond the way we would. This is frequently how an enabler justifies his continuous\nsupport for an addict. The problem, however is that our Islamic Enemy is NOT like us and will not respond\nin like kind. Rather, as we repeatedly refuse to learn, appeasement invites more abuse from an\n\nenemy. This becomes the ’game of guilt;” it tends to expand to greater and greater consequences.\nParadoxically, psychological defenses tend to create the very outcomes they seek to eliminate and it is no\ndifferent here. It is a game we love to play but, unfortunately, the game gives us no rules for how to end it.\n\nAll beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with other\nControl Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing.\n\nFP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely because of our\nControl Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers.\n\nSiegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see what he was\nabout, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that could\nallow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist views\nand Jihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the “painful liquidation” of non-Muslims. Yet, in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024424",
