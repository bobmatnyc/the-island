Interestingly, after Snapchat passed Instagram in early\n2016 in average minutes per user, Instagram recaptured the lead mid-year and has\nextended it since. While the cause for the shift is not certain, the trends align with the\nlaunch of Instagram Stories (August 2016) as well as some technology challenges on the\nSnapchat front (Android). Regardless of the near-term lumpiness, we believe overall\ndaily engagement puts Snapchat in a strong position to capture emerging online\nmarketing ad budgets.\n\nTable 23: Average minutes per user trend\nAug-2016 Sep-2016  Oct-2016 Nov-2016 Dec-2016 Jan-2017 Feb-2017\n\n‘Snapchat 267 267 272 269 an 254 211]\nInstagram 292 294 325 337 322 357 318\nFacebook 769 766 855 826 781 827 700\nTwitter 143 149 139 114 108 128 110\n\nSource: comScore, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nChart 14: Instagram vs Snapchat average monthly minutes per visitor\n400\n\n350\n300\n290\n200\n150\n100\n\n2/14\n4/14\n6/14\n8/14\n10/14\n12/14\n2/15\n4/15\n6/15\n8/15\n10/15\n12/15\n2/16\n4/16\n6/16\n8/16\n10/16\n12/16\n27\n\n——Snapchat -===Instagram\n\nSource: comScore\n\nEstimates vs Consensus\n\nOur 1Q revenue estimate of $163mn (down 1% q/q) is slightly above consensus at\n$158mn (down 5%}, but we note the range of estimates is considerable ($130-196mn)\nand some checks suggest that Snap was aggressive with advertisers in 1Q. For the\nyear, our $1.0bn revenue estimate is mostly in-line with the Street, as is our 2018\nestimate at $2.1bn. We do not model positive adjusted EBITDA until 2Q19, and expect\ninvestors to focus mostly on user revenue trends.\n\nTable 24: Snap Estimate Summary\n\n1017 2017 2017 2018 2019\nRevenue\nBofA ML est. $163 $208 $1,007 $2,057 $3,719\nGrowth Y/Y% 320% 190% 149% 104% 81%\nStreet $158 $206 $1,034 $2,032 $3,303\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Below Above Above\nEBITDA\nBofA ML est. -$168 -$158 -$580 -$335 $276\nStreet -$180 -$194 -$617 -$392 $80\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above Above\nEPS\nBofA ML est. -$0.18 -$0.15 -$0.59 -$0.37 $0.12\nStreet -$0.21 -$0.13 -$0.57 -$0.33 $0.00\nBofA ML vs Street Above Below Below Below Above\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\n\nBankof America 2 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 35\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014921",
