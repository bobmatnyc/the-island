  "text": "Inference: International Review of Science\n\nFeedback & Comments\n\nRobert Berwick\nProfessor of Computational Linguistics and Computer Science and Engineering at MIT.\n\n“Tam truly delighted that you and others have started publishing such a journal as Inference,\nwhich touches on so many of my own concerns and interests - I have been meaning for years to\nwrite articles on evolutionary theory (some like the fine ones you’ve already published); on big\ndata and its discontents (I have one on the deep troubles with deep learning); on the sloppy\nconnectome neuroscience (which you’ve covered); and so on - in fact, many of the topics on your\n“hit list”. Your abbreviations alone are priceless.”\n\nSimon Blackburn\nProfessor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge.\n\n“Many thanks for the new issue link and for the prompt payment. Unusual in the publishing\nworld.”\n\n“Fascinating. I had not realised how high you aimed.”\n\nRalph Blumenthal\nFormer reporter for The New York Times.\n\n“Thanks, looks impressive. Unable to take on anything else now but will keep in mind.”\n\nCedric Boeckx\nResearch Professor at the Catalan Institute for Advanced Studies.\n\n“Thanks for your invitation to contribute to Inference, your patience & advice. I think it came out\nnicely.”\n\nAlexander Bogomolny\nCut The Knot blog.\n\ng\n\n“T loved the journal - very broadly informative. I plan to making references to a few articles.’\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022446",
