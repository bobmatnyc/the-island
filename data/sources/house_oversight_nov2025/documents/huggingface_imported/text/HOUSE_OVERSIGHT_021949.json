And you are aware that Epstein was so closely\nassociated with Harvard, that he had his own office\nthere?\n\nA. No, I didn't know that Mr. Epstein had an\noffice at Harvard.\n\nQ. Did you know that Mr. Epstein regularly had\ndinners and other social events in which there were\nscores of distinguished academicians?\n\nA. Are we talking about Florida or New York?\n\nQ. Generally.\n\nA. Yeah, I knew there was some events like that\nin New York. I don't recall having specific information\nabout an event like that in -- in Palm Beach.\n\nMR.
