  "text": "The most effective resolution would be a negotiated outcome -- to achieve\nit, Washington will need to take preliminary steps on several fronts. A\nserious compromise needs to be put on the table, including an offer to\nsuspend crippling oil sanctions in return for specific, verifiable Iranian\nsteps to eliminate any nuclear breakout capabilities. Equally significant is\nestablishing a credible military threat, given that Tehran has been willing\nto endure increasing economic pressure in order to continue its nuclear\nprogram. The regime is unlikely to concede anything during negotiations\nif it does not believe that Washington will actually follow through on such\nthreats. Although specific public redlines are often unpalatable, the Obama\nadministration must clarify internally when it would take military steps,\nand these intentions must be made clear to the Iranians.\n\nIn the same vein, the military option requires a credible negotiating\ncomplement, as seen in the early 1990s with Iraq. To legitimize military\naction against Saddam Hussein's regime, Washington had to prove that all\nother options had been exhausted. Similarly, the only way to set the\npredicate for military action against Iran is to show the regime and the\ninternational community that everything has been tried, and that\nWashington has left Tehran with a way out. Failure to do so would\nundermine the legitimacy of any strikes.\n\nIt is also important to understand that curtailing Iran's nuclear progress\nwill not by itself alter the regime's regional agenda -- nuclear ambitions\nare but an extension of Tehran's wider aspirations toward hegemony in the\nMiddle East. Unfortunately, none of the longer-term proposals for\naddressing that issue seem feasible at the moment (e.g., regime change by\ninternal or external means; a shift in Tehran's views on the Supreme\nLeader and succession; a \"grand deal\" between Washington, Iran, and the\ninternational community).\n\nOne lesson to be learned from past interactions with Tehran (or lack\nthereof) is that when the United States proactively opposes Iranian\naggression in the Middle East, the regime relents, but when Washington\noffers a more passive response, Iranian aggression increases. With respect\nto Syria, for example, it cannot be assumed that Bashar al-Assad will fall\nat all, let alone quickly, without active U.S. engagement. If the Assad\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018204",
