  "text": "Chapter Eighteen\n\nThe first attack in the wave of Hamas suicide bombings destroyed a Jerusalem\nbus at 6:42 a.m. on February 25, 1996. It left 26 people dead, and nearly 80 injured\nfrom nails and shrapnel packed into the explosive charge. The second was near\nAshkelon. The bomber, dressed in Israeli uniform, joined a group of young soldiers\nand blew himself up, killing one of them. A week later, a third suicide attack\nblasted the roof off a bus on the same Jerusalem commuter route, leaving 19 more\ndead. And on March 4, a 24-year-old Palestinian walked up to the entrance of Tel\nAviv’s busiest shopping center, on Dizengoff Street, detonated 30 pounds of\nexplosives, and killed 13 people. At the bomb scenes, bloodied survivors and\ncrowds of pedestrians surveyed a hellscape of twisted metal, shards of glass and\nmangled body parts. While most Israelis were too shaken to worry about the\nimmediate political repercussions — and Bibi was careful, at least in the immediate\naftermath, not to try to score political points —Peres’s reelection campaign seemed\nto lie in tatters almost before it had begun.\n\nThe attacks were not a surprise. As I’d argued to the Washington think-tank\naudience before joining the government, the peace promise of Oslo had been\nassailed from the start by a new alliance of Islamist Palestinian violence: mainly\nHamas, and Islamic Jihad on the West Bank. They saw Arafat as a traitor who had\nsold out to Israel. For them, the issue wasn’t just Israel’s capture of the West Bank\nand Gaza in the 1967 war. It was 1948: they opposed any Jewish state, anywhere in\nPalestine. In a campaign of terror that made the first weeks of the intifada seem\nalmost easy to deal with, they began sending self-styled holy warriors to murder\nIsraeli civilians, and sacrifice their own lives, in the expectation of Allah’s rewards\nin the world to come. During the two years following Oslo, they’d mounted ten\nsuicide attacks, leaving nearly 80 Israelis dead. The attacks had actually stopped\nsince the summer of 1995. But when the election date was announced — with Peres\nholding a roughly 15-per-cent lead in the polls — political commentators both in\nIsrael and abroad began speculating about a resumption of terror. For Hamas, the\nelection presented not just an opportunity to kill innocent Israelis but, by helping\ndefeat Peres and Labor, perhaps to kill Oslo as well.\n\nEven before the bombings, our campaign was struggling for focus, energy and\neven purpose, beyond the aim of getting more votes than Bibi Netanyahu.
