It was judgement. Inside Aman, a kind of\ngroupthink had taken hold. It was rooted in a confident, costly misconception\nwhich went unchallenged: that Egypt would never risk another war without an\nair force capable of breaching our defences and striking towns and cities deep\ninside Israel. No one pressed the alternative scenario: that Sadat might strike\nwith more limited territorial objectives and, under cover of his SAM batteries\non the other side of the Suez Canal, advance into the Sinai.\n\nIn the Lebanon war, the inquiry suggested, Yehoshua Saguy did try to warn\nthe generals, and the government, about major risks. But individual ministers\ntestified that they hadn’t heard, hadn’t been there, or hadn’t understood, leading\nthe inquiry to stress the responsibility of a Rosh Aman to ensure not just that his\nmessage was conveyed, but that it was received as well.\n\nI set out to address both problems. Inside the department, I insisted on\nmaking all our preconceptions open to challenge. I set up a unit whose sole\nfunction was to play devil’s advocate when a consensus was reached. It began\nwith the opposite conclusion and, through a competing analysis of the data, and\nlogical argument, tried to prove it. I also wanted to be challenged on my\npreconceptions. I assigned a bright young major as my personal intelligence-\nand-analysis aide. He read everything that crossed my desk and could access\nany material in the department. “You have no responsibility to agree with any of\nthe analysts, or with me,” I said. “Part of your job is to disagree.”\n\nIn the Lebanon war, Saguy had faced an additional problem. He was\nexcluded from some government meetings at which crucial decisions were\nmade. That was out of his control. I didn’t want it to be out mine. I raised the\nissue with Begin in our first meeting. “If you want to get the maximum value\nfrom your head of intelligence,” I said, “you should make sure he’s there not\njust after, but when decisions are made.” Yet he was now only months from\nleaving office, exhausted by the war and its aftermath. He waved his hand\nweakly in response, as if to say none of it mattered. His successor, in October\n1983, was Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Ideologically, he was cut from the\nsame cloth: an advocate from the 1940s of securing a Jewish state in all of\nPalestine, by whatever force necessary. He’d broken with Begin’s pre-state\nIrgun militia to set up a group called Lehi, which went further and carried out\npolitical assassinations: the 1944 killing of Lord Moyne, Britain’s Minister for\n\n212\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011683",
