  "text": "seduction. Well-known pickup artist \"gurus\" can make millions of dollars per year: they\nmay sell books; they may sell hours of \"coaching\"; they may organize training\n\"bootcamps\" or conventions with pricy tickets; they may run companies full of\ninstructors trained in their methods. The community even generates its own well-thought-\n\nout internal critiques.\n\nI am a sex-positive feminist lecturer and writer. I write primarily about my experiences\nwith sadomasochism, but I have a general interest in sexuality. I first encountered pickup\nartists when smart ones started attending my educational events and commenting on my\nblog.\n\nSome aspects of pickup artistry are hugely problematic; many parts of the community\nshowcase and encourage misogyny. While exploring the PUA jungle, I observed things\nthat turned my stomach and brought tears to my eyes. On the other hand, I had to admit\nthat some pickup artist perspectives were very interesting. Some had fascinating insights\nabout gender theory and social power. I also felt drawn by their exploits. Learning\nseduction, and watching hypothetically-dazzling Casanovas run a courtier-like game,\nsounded like an extremely fun way to spend my time.\n\nI started my journey by talking to a few pickup artists and reading their fora. By the end, I\nhad given a lecture at a seduction convention, and I had decided against developing my\nown coaching business. Today, I can offer a quick synopsis of my own history, and why I\nbecame so interested in PUAs. I will break down some elementary distinctions among the\nmen of the seduction community. Finally, I will offer a few PUA-influenced thoughts on\nfeminist goals.\n\nte Kk ok\n\nI was an awkward little bookworm of a child, but at least I was creative. I liked to draw,\ninvent games, and run amateur social experiments. When I was in high school, most of\nmy friends were on the Internet; I did not date a real-life boyfriend until college. I was\ninevitably teased by my peers, but even when treated well, I rarely engaged with the\nsocial hierarchies around me. I had difficulty grasping how social mechanics were\n\"supposed\" to work. A lot of things seemed obvious to other people that were not obvious\nto me.\n\nFor example, in sixth grade, a female friend of mine teased me about flirting with a boy.\n\"What was I doing?\" I asked. \"Come on, you were flirting!\" she responded. While I\nthought I almost understood what she meant, I was unsure -- so I set out to poll everyone\nI knew about what constitutes \"flirting.\" Responses were inconsistent. One person said,\nvery definitely: \"Giggling.\" Others cited examples such as \"intense looks\" or \"making\njokes.\"\n\nBy the end of this experiment, I concluded that no one seemed able to explain \"flirting\" in\nterms of consistent behaviors; there were few commonalities in my final list. From what I\ncould tell, flirting could only be explained in terms of invisible interpersonal dynamics. I\nfound this both entertaining and frustrating.\n\nI sometimes wonder what would have become of me if the modern pickup artist\ncommunity had existed back then, and I had discovered it.
