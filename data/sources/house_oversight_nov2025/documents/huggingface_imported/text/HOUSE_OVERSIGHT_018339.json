  "text": "also that everything is monitored. Remebered. Studied. The Warez Dudes’ drive to\nget ever closer to the core, to perform even that atomic level hacking, tells us\nsomething about just how much power is locked up in those central cores where\nthis information accumulates. The 2600 hz whistle was, it seems, only the first of an\nendless series of battles for control of the roots and trunklines of modern power.\n\nAll around us today, huge power accumulates to certain irreplaceable cores. We\nknow this is a problem of connected age design: Giant search engines, certain\nalgorithms, database or communications protocols overmaster us because they can\ngather so much data, so fast, and process it with unique fidelity. What makes a city?\nurban scholars often ask. We might wonder: What makes a platform for network\npower? The answer to both questions is the same: Density.15? If the first cities of\nAztecs or Mesopotamiaman civilization differed from early tribal clusters because of\ntheir density, the same is true for our first platforms of instant connection. Facebook\nis denser than AOL ever was. More people, more data, thicker connections. Future\nplatforms will be denser still. And if cities and density were once sadly\nunanticipated accelerants to plague, poverty and revolution, we should be aware of\nthe risks of our own tight-clustered centers of dense connection. The security of\nthese cores that link us to each other and our essential data - when jacked by\nhackers, by companies, or even by fast algorithms we don’t understand - is\nimportant not merely because of the possibility of total control a breach might\nrepresent, but because they show us the very fact of such totalizing control exists.\nTo infect, surprise, sicken - all this is alluringly possible and dreamable for anyone\nwith a hunger for mastery. Imagine if you knew your government could be switched\ninstantly and invisibly to malice. (Or, to effectiveness!) Or picture a nation of\nconnected citizens wired for flash-started nationalism and hate. Such a possibility\nexists on linked systems. This potential for total, weird control of the cores - and\nthus total control of anyone connected to them - should force us to wonder a bit.\nEvery evil thing beats in those central nodes: The power to manipulate, to master, to\ndestroy even. With such access I can change what you know about the world, how\nyou vote, where your money sits, what you remember, how soon we spot (or don’t)\na slipped knot in your DNA.\n\n“Just like every drinking binge ends at vodka, so every hacking session ends at\nkernel.org” Thomas Dullien, the mathematician and good-guy hacker who won a\nPwnie in 2015 for lifetime security achievement, observed once!54. So much power\nin a connected system lies at its root: Kernel.org, for instance, is the reference copy\nfor LINUX computer code that powers most digital machines on earth, sort of like\nthe original DNA of the net. To manipulate Kernel.org would be to reach into the\nvery spine of the Internet. If the aim is control, if it is to find and exploit the most\nfundamental of cracks in the surface of the black boxes, to get even deeper inside,\n\n153 What makes a city?: Colin McFarlane, “The geographies of urban density:\ntopology, politics and the city.” Progress in Human Geography (2015) p. 2\n\n154 “Just like every drinking binge”: Halvar Flake/Thomas Dullien, “Why Johnny\nCan’t Tell If He Is Compromised,” speech delievered at Area41 Conference, (Zurich,\nJune 2014)\n\n107\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018339",
