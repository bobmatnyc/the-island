( over 18). | was never, ever, his \"sex slave \"\n\n. obviously a lurid chauvenistic categorization. which in my opinion could only have been\n\nmade by some loser of a repressed male reporter. He was always kind , funny and generous to\nme . These fantasy fabrications made by a delusional thief. ( charged with stealing from the burger\nplace and which she worked, though she claimed to paid thousands of dollars in cash and held at\nthe beck and call of the genious tycoon. ) . Her story telling had it been done while sleeping would\nhave been called dreaming, if awake, hallucinaitons but to the English press they are referred to as\nallegations . She claimed in the minutest of detail , her dinner with President Clinton on the\nCaribean Island, How he arrived . ( by black heli). where he sat. ,(on jeffreys left.) a21st century\ntale of power , sex, money. The fact is that this story is total make believe , fabricated on purpose\nto gain tabloid attention ,and easily refuted by readily availalble travel records of a former\n\npresident. . it defies belief that any person would take seriously such a preposterous story. little\ndifferent than her telling her father that she met the queen, whoops- he believed her though her\nmother at the relevant time complained that she must have been engaging in satan worship and\nasked that she be put her in a drug home. cmon. | am currenty a professional pilot with a spotless\nrecord. | have a checklist that | follow before every flight to verify that things are what they are\nsupposed to be , checking her story which the presss has refused to do would serve the public well.\nIn this case human error is merely a euphmisn for hijacking the truth ,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021811",
