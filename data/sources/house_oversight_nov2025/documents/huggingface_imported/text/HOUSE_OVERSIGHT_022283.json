  "text": "54012\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nthat precedent in Nash-Finch Co., the\nSupreme Court concluded that the\nBoard also had implied authority ‘‘to\nenjoin state action where [the Board’s]\nfederal power preempts the field.’ 404\nU.S. at 144. Like these judicially\nrecognized powers, the notice-posting\nrequirement that is the subject of this\nrulemaking has not been specifically\nprovided for by Congress. But the cited\ncases demonstrate that Congress need\nnot expressly list a power for the Board\nto legitimately exercise it. Indeed, the\nnotice-posting requirement is not even\nan implied power of the Board in the\nsame sense as those previously\nmentioned. Rather, it is the product of\nthe Board’s exercise of express\nrulemaking authority and inherent gap-\nfilling authority, both of which have\nbeen delegated to the Board by\nCongress.\n\n2. The First Amendment and Section\n8(c) of the NLRA\n\nA handful of commenters argue that\nthe notice-posting requirement violates\nthe First Amendment to the\nConstitution, Section 8(c) of the NLRA,\nor both. For example, the Center on\nNational Labor Policy, Inc. maintains\nthat “compelling an employer to post its\nproperty with a Notice that asserts the\nstatutory ‘rights’ and employer\nobligations, runs counter to\nconstitutional views long protected by\nthe Supreme Court.”’ The Center also\nargues that the “proposed poster would\nimpede the employer’s statutory right to\nexpress itself on its own property.”\nAlong these same lines, the National\nRight to Work Legal Defense\nFoundation, Inc. and others on whose\nbehalf it writes contend that ‘‘the\nBoard’s proposal for forced speech\nfavoring unionization directly conflicts\nwith the First Amendment and\nlongstanding federal labor policy under\nSection 8(c) that employers and unions\nshould be able to choose themselves\nwhat to say about unionization.” These\nconcerns were echoed by the National\nAssociation of Wholesaler-Distributors.\nIn addition, two attorneys affiliated with\nPilchak Cohen & Tice, P.C., which they\ndescribe as “a management-side labor\nand employment law firm,” argue that\nthe notice-posting requirement\n“tramples upon employers’ Free Speech\nrights by regulating the content of\ninformation that employers are required\nto tell employees and by compelling\nthem to post the Notice containing pro-\nunion NLRA rights, when it is almost\nassuredly not the employers’ prerogative\nto do so.”’ The Independent Association\nof Bakers goes further and characterizes\nthe regulation as an unconstitutional\n“eae order’ that “prohibits the\n\nemployer from telling the truth about\nthe impact a union might pose to his\nbusiness.” The Board rejects these\narguments.\n\nAs an initial matter, requiring a notice\nof employee rights to be posted does not\nviolate the First Amendment, which\nprotects the freedom of speech. Indeed,\nthis rule does not involve employer\nspeech at all. The government, not the\nemployer, will produce and supply\nposters informing employees of their\nlegal rights. The government has sole\nresponsibility for the content of those\nposters, and the poster explicitly states\nthat it is an “official Government\nNotice’; nothing in the poster is\nattributed to the employer. In fact, an\nemployer has no obligation beyond\nputting up this government poster.\nThese same considerations were present\nin Lake Butler Apparel Co. v. Secretary\nof Labor, 519 F.2d 84, 89 (5th Cir. 1975),\nwhere the Fifth Circuit rejected as\n“nonsensical” an employer’s First\nAmendment challenge to the\nOccupational Safety and Health Act\nrequirement that it post an ‘‘information\nsign’’ similar to the one at issue here. As\nin Lake Butler, an employer subject to\nthe Board’s rule retains the right to\n“differ with the wisdom of * * * this\nrequirement even to the point * * * of\nchallenging its validity. * * * But the\nFirst Amendment which gives him the\nfull right to contest validity to the bitter\nend cannot justify his refusal to post a\nnotice * * * thought to be essential.”\nId.; see also Stockwell Mfg. Co. v. Usery,\n536 F.2d 1306, 1309-10 (10th Cir. 1976)\n(dicta) (rejecting a constitutional\nchallenge to a requirement that an\nemployer post a copy of an OSHA\ncitation).\n\nBut even if the Board’s notice-posting\nrequirement is construed to compel\nemployer speech, the Supreme Court\nhas recognized that governments have\n“substantial leeway in determining\nappropriate information disclosure\nrequirements for business\ncorporations.” Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v.\nPub. Utils. Comm’n, 475 U.S. 1, 15 n.12\n(1985). This discretion is particularly\nwide when the government requires\ninformation disclosures relevant to the\nemployment relationship. Thus, as the\nD.C. Circuit has observed, ‘‘an\nemployer’s right to silence is sharply\nconstrained in the labor context, and\nleaves it subject to a variety of burdens\nto post notices of rights and risks.”\nUAW-Labor Employment & Training\nCorp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 365 (D.C.\nCir. 2003) (UAW v. Chao) (citing Lake\nButler, 519 F.2d at 89). Accordingly, the\nBoard’s notice-posting requirement is\n\nnot susceptible to a First Amendment\nchallenge.*4\n\nThe Board is equally satisfied that the\nrule does not violate NLRA Section 8(c),\n29 U.S.C. 158(c), which creates a safe\nharbor for noncoercive speech in the\nunfair labor practice area. Specifically,\nSection 8(c) shields from unfair labor\npractice liability “‘[t]he expressing of\nany views, argument or opinion,”\nprovided that “such expression contains\nno threat of reprisal or force or promise\nof benefit.” Id. (emphasis added). A\ngovernment poster containing accurate,\nfactual information about employees’\nlegal rights “merely states what the law\nrequires.” Lake Butler, 519 F.2d at 89.\nFor that reason, “[t]he posting of the\nnotice does not by any stretch of the\nimagination reflect one way or the other\non the views of the employer.” Id.4°\n\n44 The decision of the intermediate state court in\nSmith v. Fair Employment & Housing Commission,\n30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 395 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994), rev’d on\nother grounds, 913 P.2d 909 (Cal. 1996), lends no\nsupport to arguments challenging these regulations\non First Amendment grounds. There, the California\nCourt of Appeal held that a landlord’s right to\nfreedom of speech was “‘implicate[d],” id. at 401—\n02, by a state fair housing agency’s remedial order\nrequiring her to sign, post, and distribute notices\n“setting out the provisions of [the fair housing\nstatute], the outcome of th[e] case, and the\nstatement that [she] practices equal housing\nopportunity.” 913 P.2d at 914. The Smith case is\nnot persuasive here because the notice at issue in\nSmith would not merely have set forth the rights\nof prospective buyers or renters but also would\nhave contained a signed statement from the\nlandlord which would have given the false\nappearance that she agreed with the state’s fair\nhousing “concepts and rules,” despite her religious\nbeliefs to the contrary. 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 401. That\nfeature of the case has no parallel here. Here, by\ncontrast, employers are not required to sign the\ninformational notice, and as noted, nothing in the\nposter is attributed to them. The Board further notes\nthat the Smith decision is not authoritative because\nit was superseded by the California Supreme\nCourt’s grant of review in that case. See 913 P.2d\nat 916 n.*.\n\n45 The Employers Association of New Jersey is\ntherefore off the mark when it argues that the\nnotice-posting requirement is preempted under the\nprinciples of Lodge 76, International Ass’n of\nMachinists & Aerospace Workers v. Wisconsin\nEmployment Relations Commission, 427 U.S. 132\n(1976), as an attempt to regulate employer speech\n“about unionization and collective bargaining.” As\nexplained above, the employer’s choice whether to\nexpress its own views, arguments, or opinions is\nwholly unaffected by a requirement to post a\ngovernment-provided notice summarizing what the\nlaw requires. Indeed, consistent with both\nMachinists and the policy of Section 8(c) “‘to\nencourage free debate on issues dividing labor and\nmanagement,’ Brown, 554 U.S. at 67 (quoting Linn\nv. United Plant Guard Workers, Local 114, 383 U.S.\n53, 62 (1966)), employers remain free under this\nrule—as they have in the past—to express\nnoncoercive views regarding the exercise of these\nrights as well as others. See, e.g., United Techs.\nCorp., 274 N.L.R.B. 609, 609, 618-20, 624-26\n(1985), enforced sub nom. NLRB v. Pratt & Whitney\nAir Craft Div.v., United Techs. Corp., 789 F.2d 121\n(2d Cir. 1986); Warrensburg Bd. & Paper Corp., 143\nN.L.R.B. 398, 398-99 (1963), enforced, 340 F.2d 920\n(2d Cir. 1965). For this reason, the Board finds it\nunnecessary to adopt the proposal made by the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022283",
