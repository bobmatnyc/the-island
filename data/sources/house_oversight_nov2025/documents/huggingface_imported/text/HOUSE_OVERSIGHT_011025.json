  "text": "at the collective scale and where “ex post net” is again understood before “output.”\n\n(5.1), but not (4.1), guarantees that terms are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n\nTotal growth means this ex post net investment (growth of physical capital) plus\ngrowth of human capital. The latter would have puzzled us before the contribution\n\nof Ben-Porath. Equation (4) in his 1967 paper, summarizing the first three, shows\n\nhuman growth = invested consumption + self-invested work\n— human depreciation, (5.2)\n\nusing my terms rather than his.\n\nChapter 6 will argue that this equation needs to be clarified. I gave a preview in\nChapter 2, and will update it now. Work is the output of human capital. Output is not\nalways positive. It is negative whenever growth and cash flow sum to less than zero.\nA negative sum of these two shows unrecovered decapitalition (also called\ndeadweight loss). That would include unrecovered human depreciation. If (5.2)\nmeant all including negative self-invested work less all including unrecovered\nhuman depreciation, it would subtract unrecovered human depreciation twice. Then\n\nit must be corrected either to\n\nhuman growth = invested consumption + positive self-invested work\n— human depreciation, (5.3)\n\nor equivalently\n\nhuman growth = invested consumption + self-invested work\n— recovered human depreciation. (5.3a)\n\nIt is clear that Ben-Porath meant (5.3), as other evidence shows that he treated\n\nhuman depreciation as unrecovered. So does all tradition, mistakenly | believe, with\n\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 6\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011025",
