  "text": "support him. Do we want to break the genteel precedents of two parties running their ceremonious and\nseemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and New Hampshire play\nsuch outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system\nfailed in 2016, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to\n\nbuild a back-up plan in the event the system fails again.\n\nIt's possible, of course, that we won’t need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for\nwhatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take\n\nthose bets.\n\nThe ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination\nof both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear,\ndemocratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this\n\non the national stage now.\n\nAs a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the\nchemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard\n\nSchultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich?\n\nAs we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary\nsystem in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in\nAmerican’s demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding\nsteady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may\nbe susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot\nand presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties’ fundraising and voter\nturn-out operations preordain failure, but they’re wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a\ncombination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of\ncandidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique —\n\nand purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026299",
