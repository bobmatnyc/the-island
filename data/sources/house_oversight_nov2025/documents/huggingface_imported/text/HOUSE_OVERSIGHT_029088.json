You do not drink or smoke, probably do not inject etc. you swim \nor exercise every day, so your heartbeat is expected to be low and less variable than average. Is your ability to \npredict heart rate accurately—without holding your neck or wrist—positively related to your ability to succeed \nin the financial world—as the attached strongly suggests. Just give me and N=1. \nRemember you asked me, what does self-knowledge have to do with anything—and here is a most intriguing \nexample. \nI will send you a joke shortly \nAll best \nbob \nplease note \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029088 \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
