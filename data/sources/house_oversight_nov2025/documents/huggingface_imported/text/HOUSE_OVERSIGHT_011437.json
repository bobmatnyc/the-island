PAGLIUCA: You know, she could be asked that\nquestion: Did you know there was an investigation? I think\n\nshe's going to say no. I gave you her affidavit in which she\n\nsaid prior to making her statement, she had never seen thes\npolice reports. So we all know --\n\nTHE COURT: That's a different question.\n\nMR. PAGLIUCA: I understand. But we all know the\n\nanswer is, that's in these police reports, and I'm pretty sure\n\nshe testified at her deposition that she wasn't really aware of\n\nthis investigation. All she knew -- I think is what she\ntestified to -- was that Epstein went to jail and she knew at\nsome point he was a registered sex offender. Those are the two\nthings I think she knew at the end of the day at this\n\ndeposition. Anyway, I agree with you that the question, did\n\nyou know there was an investigation, you know, I suppose you\ncan ask that question and the answer will be yes or no,\nwhatever it is.\n\nital\n\n|e\n\nCOURT: Okay.\n\nMR.
