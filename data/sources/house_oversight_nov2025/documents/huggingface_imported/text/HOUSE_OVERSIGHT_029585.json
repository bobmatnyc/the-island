( sometimes by\nHyatt but not often). Hyatt receives 3 percent per year of revenue and a piece of the profits sometimes if the\nhotel is sold at a profit. .\n\nmoney launderers. need a name to purchase trophy properties. why? there is little suspicion if a\n\nfamous wealthy person buys a property that is likely to show in the press. , it cant be jojo my driver. up\nfront , so they approach wealthy people and tell them for 2 -5 million dollars for doing nothing at all. - just\nlend us your name .- and the person get the positive press. so and so bought the most expensive\n\npainting. sold the most expensive painting, house., diamond. etc. -ex the GANZ art collection was bought\nand sold by Joe Lewis.. all the publicity was the ganz family estate. selling etc.\n\nhypothetically, . someone approached trump and said can you buy the palm beach house. in your\nname.
