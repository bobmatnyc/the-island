  "text": "Centuries from now, our great-great grandchildren will look back at our age and\nname it as we have named “The Enlightenment.” Perhaps they will call this era “The\nGreat Connection” or the “The Enmeshmnet” or somesuch. They will spot the\nwinners and losers of our age as we do in our own review of history. That distant\ngeneration will identify a new “convergence club” emerging among us now, even if\nwe can’t quite name its members yet. Already we can see lavish rewards\naccumulating to the people and nations and companies who have established an\nearly grip on this new sensibility. They understand and manipulate connective\npower. What they all share is a feeling, as instant and certain as an instinct, for what\nit means to be enclosed, constantly, by ever growing masses of connection. A set of\nforces, invisible to many, is now applying a merciless and grinding pressure to the\nfamiliar structures of an older age.\n\nThe struggles of our cherished institutions - the US congress, the military, the news\nmedia, our educational system, our once-inclusive capitalism - to achieve the very\naims that they once elegantly and efficiently met is only the visible evidence of this\nshift. Buried underneath their lurching collapse is the real source of this change, a\nnew connective energy. Power is now passing with a rippling, ripping energy from\nold, once-useful people and institutions and ideas and into these new platforms and\nprotocols, built for an age of connection. If this passage has so far only wiped out\nencyclopedias, telephone companies or taxi medallions, it is merely because it is just\nbeginning.\n\n2.\n\nThe Seventh Sense, in short, is the ability to look at any object and see the way in\nwhich it is changed by connection. This is the essential skill. Whether you are\ncommanding an army, running a Fortune 50 company, planning a great work of art\nor thinking about your children’s education. You need to be able to look ata car, a\nhotel room, a share of stock, a language, a translation machine and say to yourself:\nConnection changes the nature of an object. It changes the nature of every object\naround it. This book is the story of just how and why that happens and of the way in\nwhich an instinct for this power now rests behind the fattest fortunes and the\ngreatest successes of our age. Connection changes the nature of an object means\nconnection changes the nature of your life, of mine, of our government, of the wars\nwe fight and the peace we secure. The heart of the problem ahead of us is not small.\nIt is nothing less than the most significant shift of power balances since the\nEnlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. How high are the stakes? If the\nEnlightenment is our reference, then | think we can say they are nothing less than\ntotal.\n\nOf all the Seventh Sense ideas, this single concept is the most fundamental:\nConnection changes the nature of an object. A medical diagnostic machine is\nimpressive; one that is connected to a database of information that can accelerate\nand improve or perfect a diagnosis is revolutionary. The act of linking our bodies,\nour cities, our ideas - everything really - together, introduces a genuinely new\ndynamic to our world. It creates hyper-dense concentrations of power. It breeds\n\n21\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018253",
