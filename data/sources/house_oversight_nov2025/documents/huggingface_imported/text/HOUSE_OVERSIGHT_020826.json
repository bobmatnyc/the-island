  "text": "Foreword\n\nGeorge P. Shultz, Paul Volcker, Michael Bloomberg, Richard Ravitch and John Doerr\nFebruary 2011\n\nOur country is in deep financial trouble. Federal, state and local governments are deep in debt\nyet continue to spend beyond their means, seemingly unable to stop. Our current path is simply\nunsustainable. What to do?\n\nA lot of people have offered suggestions and proposed solutions. Few follow the four key\nguideposts to success that we see for setting our country back on the right path:\n\n1) create a deep and widely held perception of the reality of the problem and the stakes involved;\n2) reassure citizens that there are practical solutions;\n\n3) develop support in key constituencies; and\n\n4) determine the right timing to deliver the solutions.\n\nUSA Inc. uses each of these guideposts, and more; it is full of ideas that can help us build a\nbetter future for our children and our country.\n\nFirst, Mary Meeker and her co-contributors describe America’s problems in an imaginative way\nthat should allow anyone to grasp them both intellectually and emotionally. By imagining the\nfederal government as a company, they provide a simple framework for understanding our\ncurrent situation. They show how deficits are piling up on our income statement as spending\noutstrips income and how our liabilities far exceed nominal assets on our balance sheet. USA\nInc. also considers additional assets — hard to value physical assets and our intangible wealth —\nour creativity and energy and our tradition of an open, competitive society.\n\nAdditionally, the report considers important trends, pointing specifically to an intolerable failure to\neducate many in the K-12 grades, despite our knowledge of how to do so. And all these\nimportant emotional arguments help drive a gut reaction to add to data provided to reinforce the\nintellectual reasons we already have.\n\nSecond, USA Inc. provides a productive way to think about solving our challenges. Once we\nhave created an emotional and intellectual connection to the problem, we want people to act and\ndrive the solution, not to throw up their hands in frustration. The authors’ ingenious indirect\napproach is to ask what a turnaround expert would do and what questions he or she would ask.\nThe report describes how we first stumbled into this mess, by failing to predict the magnitude of\nprogram costs, by creating perverse incentives for excessive behavior, and by missing important\ntrends. By pointing to the impact of individual responsibility, USA /nc. gives us reason to believe\nthat a practical solution exists and can be realized.\n\nCB www.kpcb.com USA Inc. © iii\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020826",
