  "text": "Real estate offers income generation and\n\naccess optionality\n\nThis year, sovereigns cited a range of reasons for\nincreasing target real estate allocations, including\nthe scope to capture liquidity alpha, the potential\n\nto generate income matching mid- to long-term\nliabilities and the potential for internalisation and\ncontrol. With lower interest rates, lower funding\ncommitments to sovereigns and a lack of appetite\nto vary asset allocations, the potential for leveraged\nparticipation in real estate (equity and debt) appeals\nto sovereigns seeking alternative means of scaling\n‘frozen’ asset allocation to match liabilities.\n\nIn addition, while there are few alternatives to\nthird-party management and fee structures across\ninfrastructure and private equity (with co-investment\nin many cases challenged by fund governance and\nrisk appetite), sovereigns have a broad range of\noptions to participate in the development, acquisition\nand management of real estate. Indeed, there was\nno consensus among sovereigns on the best placed\nreal estate manager, with internal and external\nmanagers, developers and operators cited as\npreferred real estate partners in figure 16. Sovereigns\nare also attracted to the flexibility of real estate value\nchain participation as it reduces upfront funding\ncommitments and allows for a gradual internalisation\nof expertise and resource.\n\n25\n\nLow fixed income\nyields means\nsovereigns are\nbeginning to view\nproperty asa\nreliable source of\nincome.\n\nFig 16.
