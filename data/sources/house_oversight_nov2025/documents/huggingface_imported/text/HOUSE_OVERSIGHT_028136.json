  "text": "/ BARAK / 2\n\ncabinet meeting the day before, by reviving an idea I’d supported under Rabin: to\nbuild a security fence all along the edge of the West Bank, with a series of\ncontrolled crossing points for people and goods. Yitzhak had said no at the time,\nbecause he was worried it would be seen as a de facto border and undermine the\nidea of building coexistence. My view then, and even more so now, was that we\nwould never get to the point of negotiating a final peace with the Palestinians\nunless we could stop at least most of the terror attacks before they happened. Peres,\ntoo, had been worried about “undermining coexistence.” But now, he and the rest\nof the cabinet were so shaken by the carnage Hamas had left that they approved the\nidea of a security barrier.\n\nAt our kirya meeting, hours after the latest bomb had exploded less than a mile\naway, Peres recognized we had to go further. Under Oslo, we had begun giving the\nPalestinians control over internal security in Gaza and parts of the West Bank.\nSince the new Hamas attacks, Arafat had been saying the right things. After the\nfirst bomb in Jerusalem, he’d phoned Shimon to offer condolences, telling\nreporters afterward that this was “a terrorist operation. I condemn it completely. It\nis not only against civilians, but against the whole peace process.” Yet when it\ncame to action, we saw no sign that he was willing, ready, or perhaps able to crack\ndown on the Islamist terror attacks. So Peres now announced that, if necessary in\norder to detain known terrorists, we would for the first time send Israeli troops\nback into areas where control had been handed back. If Arafat didn’t act, we\nwould.\n\nOn the political front, Peres did get some good news: President Clinton, anxious\nto preserve the progress he’d worked so closely with Yitzhak to achieve, organized\nan unprecedented show of international condemnation of the terror attacks. With\nEgypt’s Hosni Mubarak, he co-chaired a “Summit of Peacemakers” in Sharm al-\nSheikh with the participation not just of an equally concerned King Hussein, and of\ncourse Arafat, but leaders of Arab states from North Africa to Saudi Arabia and the\nGulf. The only significant holdout was Syria’s Hafez al-Assad. He objected\nbecause he said the conference was too focused on Israel. As Foreign Minister, I\naccompanied Shimon to the summit. A single day’s meeting was never going to\nend terror. But it was unprecedented in the breadth of Arab engagement in an\ninitiative that, as Assad had anticipated, didn’t just condemn terror in general. It\nspecifically denounced the attacks being launched inside Israel.\n\n288\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028136",
