  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nWhen I told Bazelon about the justice quote from the Torah, he asked me why the word justice\nwas repeated. Wouldn’t it have been enough to say “justice you must actively chase after.”\n“Why ‘justice, justice.”” No word, or even syllable of the Torah is supposed to be redundant.\nEvery one has a meaning. I told Judge Bazelon that the rabbis had a field day providing\ninterpretation to the repeat of justice. My favorite, the one I had proposed in my Bar Mitzvah\nspeech, was that the first “tzedek” meant legal justice, while the second meant compassionate\njustice. Judge Bazelon corrected me: “Compassion must come before the law. The first means\ncompassionate justice, the second legal justice.” Whichever came first in Judge Bazelon’s court,\nevery decision that he wrote or joined combined elements of both. His compassion wasn’t always\nappreciated, even by its objects. Judge Bazelon once showed me a letter he received from his\nmost famous defendant, a man named Monte Durham. Durham was the defendant in the case in\nwhich Bazelon announced his innovative approach to the insanity defense in the form of a new\ntule called “The Durham Rule” that declared a person to be legally insane, and thus not guilty, if\nhis crime was “the product” of a mental disease or defect. This controversial rule revolutionized\nthe relationship between law and psychiatry. The letter from Monte Durham complained about\nthe rule bearing his name. “Now everyone calls me “Durham the Nutcase.’” He noted that when\ndoctors discover a new disease, they name it after themselves and not after the patient. He\nwondered why the new rule wasn’t called “The Bazelon Rule” instead of the “Durham Rule!”\nBazelon apologized to Durham and noted that if judges could name new rules after themselves\nthere would be too many new rules.\n\nJudge Bazelon and I were a match made, if not in heaven, at least in legal nirvana. I learned a lot\nfrom him and even taught him a little. We remained lifelong friends, though the year of clerking\nwas more like hell than heaven, at least as regards to working conditions.\n\nBazelon was never satisfied. He never told me that a draft opinion or article was good. It always\nneeded to be “made better.” “It’s getting there” or “it’s close,” was the highest compliment he\never paid. But when it was done and published, and colleagues complimented him on the finished\nproduct, he would always give me credit. But never to my face. I always had to hear it from\nothers. He was beyond a perfectionist. He knew his opinions would be read by generations of\nlaw students, professors, lower court judges and assorted critics. He was on a never-ending\nmission, and nothing was ever good enough. Even if it was good enough to publish or deliver\nbecause of artificial deadlines, it was never quite good enough for David Bazelon. But the long\nhours, demanding boss and difficult working conditions were well worth it. Law clerks who\nendured this trial by fire went on to great careers. Former Bazelon clerks include the deans of\nHarvard and Yale Law Schools, the President of New York University, the former Chancellor of\nthe New York City school system, a prominent reform rabbi, numerous law professors, lawyers\nand business and political leaders. He influenced us all, and his influence continues in the work\nthat many still do. As Peter Strauss, a law professor at Columbia once aptly characterized the\nrelationship between Judge Bazelon and his clerks: “He the pebble, we the ripples.”\n\nThe primary job of the law clerk related to the appellate cases that came before the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In the years I was a clerk, that court served not\nonly as a federal appellate court, but also as the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, a\nreasonably sized city with a racially mixed population and a relatively high violent crime rate.\nMany of our cases involved very high level appeals relating to federal administrative\n\n53\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017140",
