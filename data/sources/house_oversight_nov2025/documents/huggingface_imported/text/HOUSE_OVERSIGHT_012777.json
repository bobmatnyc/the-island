  "text": "differences, all inflicted with this developmental disorder have difficulty understanding the beliefs,\nintentions and emotions of others, and often become hyper-aroused when seeing, hearing, or touching\nrather unremarkable objects or events. All of these capacities require a system that can integrate multiple\nsources of information. During brain scanning, individuals with autism show a striking reduction in\nactivity in an area called the insula and its connection to both the somatosensory cortex and amygdala.\nThe insula is an area of the brain that is like a traffic cop, responsible for coordinating the flow of\ninformation in the brain, both where it is coming from and where it should go. The somatosensory cortex\nhandles our body’s response to the world, including its state of arousal. The amygdala plays a key role in\nemotional processing, and more generally, in generating positive or negative assessments about the value\nof an experience. With the traffic cop asleep, and the body’s arousal and emotional hubs dormant, it is no\nwonder that those with autism lack empathy, can’t understand what it means for someone to be in love,\nare befuddled by deception, and find the bombardment from our media-intense world truly\noverwhelming. The lack of connectivity among those with autism is proof that connectivity is necessary\nfor promiscuous thinking.\n\nOnce we evolved our massively connected, promiscuous brain, tool use, communication,\nmathematics, music, and morality were transformed. No longer were we constrained to think within the\nconfines of the evolved context. We could take aspects of an ancient psychology that evolved for one\nproblem and use it for new purposes, some beneficial to us individually and as members of a group, and\nsome costly to our own and others’ survival.\n\nConsider our capacity to defend members within a group against attack from individuals outside\nthe group. Many, perhaps even the majority of religious groups have carried out this mission, some with\nviolence such as the Catholic-Protestant conflict in Ireland, and some with tranquility such as the\nTibetan’s plea for peace amidst a powerful Chinese oppressor. The process starts, however, with an\nancient system that we share with all socially living animals. To survive and reproduce, individuals\ncooperate with members of their own group and defend their resources against members of neighboring\ngroups. All animals, humans included, recognize group members by distinctive markings or recalling\nfeatures associated with specific individuals. We transformed this evolutionarily ancient capacity into a\ndistinctively human one by combining it with our systems of language, morality, and beliefs. This\ncombination allows us to use symbols to demarcate those within our group from those outside, to tie these\nsymbols to distinctive beliefs, values, and emotions, and to use these different psychological systems to\ncaricature the other as buffoon, vermin, parasite, or inanimate cargo. This combinatorial process allows\nus to cleanse the in-group by annihilating the out-group. It allows us to increase cooperation within a\ngroup while ramping up the defenses to take out enemies living outside the group. This strategy is\n\nsimple and effective. First, convince one group of people that another group has a set of undesirable traits,\n\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 31\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012777",
