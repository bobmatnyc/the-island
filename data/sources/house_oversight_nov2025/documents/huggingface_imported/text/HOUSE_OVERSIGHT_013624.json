  "text": "The Freudian psychoanalyst of my younger days tried to write off these (to me)\ncataclysmic changes as manifestations of male sons’ unconscious oedipal strivings\nto father kill and thus become. After some mulling, my theory did not wash.\n\nThey spent time accompanying themselves on guitars, singing hymns and\nshouted Corinthian Paulisms to small curious crowds gathered in beach parking\nlots, city parks and inner city street corners of Southern California. They passed out\npamphlets containing New Testament tracts and formulaic aphorisms promising the\npost-repentance blessings of Jesus. The eldest, articulate, bright and prematurely\nworldly, had been an ardent memorizer and appreciator of Shakespeare, especially\nthe mystical Tempest, the music of Aaron Copeland and Igor Stravinsky, the\nimprovisations of Charlie Parker and Cannon Ball Adderley and the provocative\nliterature of the time including Jack Kerouc’s On the Road and Hunter Thompson’s\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
