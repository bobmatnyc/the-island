  "text": "growing, selling, consuming and outlawing of illegal drugs around the\nworld is a complex mix of economics, politics and world culture.\n\nThere are silly conspiracies. Some folks believe that the moon\nlanding was faked (those were close-up photos of oatmeal). Others believe\nthat the Woodstock Festival never occurred (it was contrived by the\nmedia). Still others believe that Elvis Presley’ s death was fabricated (he’ s\nalive in Las Vegas, working as an Elvis impersonator). And surely there\nmust be others who are convinced that militant vegetarian activists are\nresponsible for Mad Cow disease.\n\nSometimes silly conspiracists get results. In 1995, Indiana\ntransportation officials were forced to alter the maintenance codes marked\non the back of highway signs because some state residents were\nconvinced that the markings were coded messages designed to assist\ninvading UN troops.\n\nAnd there are serious conspiracies. Gasoline refiners conspire to limit\nsupply and fix prices. The relationship between doctors and\npharmaceutical companies is blatantly conspiratorial. Douglas Valentine\nwrote in 7he Phoenix Program (about the CIA’ s notorious terrorist\ncampaign against Vietnamese villagers) that in 1968 the Army’ s 111th\n\nMilitary Intelligence Group kept Martin Luther King under 24-hours-a-day\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015262",
