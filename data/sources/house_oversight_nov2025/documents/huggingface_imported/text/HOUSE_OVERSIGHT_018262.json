  "text": "preserved. But, also, we must move on. These people will never grasp the\nopportunity that lingers in front of us now.\n\nThis book is not, in any event, written for them. It is written for those of us who are\ninheriting the possibility of their inventions, the price of their errors. And it is aimed\ntoo at the people and the generation who are coming to power and who are - in\nsome senses—already in power, even if they don’t appear to be just yet. By this |\nmean the cohort bred into the age of connected acceleration; the first generation of\nleaders and students and warfighters and entrepreneurs to not find the digital\nstrange, but to find it natural and curious and wonderful in its power. It is written\nfor those who will have to manage machines that are smarter than humans,\nnetworks that move faster than we can calculate, and cascades of chaos and conflict\nand creation as this new era settles in. It is for anyone too who has ever begun to\nspeak about the strange tensions of our age, who has begun maybe with the lines,\n“Maybe I’m sensitive or something, but...” as they feel the tickle of their own lives,\nminds and cells increasingly intertwined, electrified. It is written for those afflicted\nwith an aching feeling that we're being torn apart. Pulled into foolish conflicts and\ndangerous failures by old figures who don’t understand this age. Pulled into\nsacrifices of liberty and freedom by young technological wizards who can’t balance\nthe miracle of their cold inventions with our hot, human needs for freedom and\ncontrol.\n\nBut I should say too that this book is not, either, a full-throated endorsement of the\ntechnological elite. Yes, it’s wonderful that we are at the beginning of a new period.\nBut it’s not quite right to say that where the network age begins, the old one ends. In\nfact, that's a dangerous conclusion. To begin with we're at an extremely primitive\npoint in our understanding of networks, comparable to where economics was in the\n1800s or medicine centuries ago. We have a small, modest collection of tools to\nanalyze and think about and consider the complex physics of a networked world.\nWe barely understand the operation and evolution of many single networks today -\nand really only sort of grasp one or two types of design with any real depth. But\nnetworks of networks? Instant networks? Artificially intelligent ones? We have\nbasically no laws or experience with these yet.\n\nThe headlong rush ahead into a world of constant connection will, of course, be\nbalanced, resisted, braced against, undermined, fought and manipulated. Networks\ntouch everything, remember? The idea that such elemental control - of you, of me,\nof our finances or our nations - would move with anything less than a few\nexplosions is naive. Revolutions don’t occur quietly. Consequently, the very thing\nthat makes many of the greatest tech minds of our age magnificent - a sense of\nunstoppable determinism, a disregard for history, a slavish and instinctive urge to\nfollow what we’ll come to know as a Seventh Sense - is a bit of a disadvantage at\ntimes. | know many of these men and women; their iron certainty is only a bit more\ndazzling than the success they have had in building something from nothing ina\nhuman instant. But that confidence in the new leads already to crushing collisions\nwith the sorts of older ideas - privacy, localism, slowness - that echo throughout\n\n30\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018262",
