His solution\nremoves the requirement for many worlds and, indeed, our curious\nposition as the conscious beings that bring the world into existence. Of\ncourse, Penrose does not stop there. He proposes the quantum gravity\ninteraction gives rise to conscious thought and this process is the root of\nmathematical intuition.\n\nThe aim of our discussion is to show where determinism might break\ndown in the physical laws of the Universe. If our Universe is determined,\nthere will need to be a huge quantity of information stored somewhere\nto tell it what to do at each step. Storing a script for the Universe is not\nthe conventional way people imagine determinism works. Rather they\nexplain the apparent complexity we see through the application of a\nsimple set of rules called ‘the laws of physics. We imagine using these\nlaws to expand up a small set of starting conditions into the complexity\nof the Universe we experience. This is similar to the way fractals produce\nbeautifully complex images from a tiny quantity of information. For\nexample, the Mandelbrot set is created from a single, simple mathematical\nstatement just twelve characters long, with one or two starting numbers.\nIf this is how our Universe works then our thoughts and actions are just\nlike the fronds of a fractal. It would mean the particles in the Universe\n‘know what they will do next and carry enough information with them\nto determine their next action. This is a testable hypothesis and the test\nwe have devised to measure this is the twin particle experiment.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016019",
