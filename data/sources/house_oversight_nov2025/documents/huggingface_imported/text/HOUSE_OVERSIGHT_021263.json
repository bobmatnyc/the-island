  "text": "From Selfish Genes to Social Brains\n\nThe Chicago Social Brain\nNetwork was established to examine\nhow science might inform us about our\nfundamental human nature, including the\napparently irrepressible quest for\nconnection with a higher understanding\nand organization. Science can describe\nwhat religion does in rigorous ways that\nbenefit religion, and religion can serve a\nmeaning-making function that science\nitself disclaims. This is not to say that\nscience can address the existence of\nGod. Our Network instead focuses on\nthe consequences of believing in such a\nmind and of seeing into that mind.\n\nIn the next chapter, John\nCacioppo, a social neuroscientist, draws\non work on evolutionary theory,\nsociobiology, and evolutionary\npsychology to examine the implications\nof the selfish gene hypothesis for Homo\nsapiens. He shows how the notion of the\nselfish gene has been joined with\npolitical theory, consumerism, and\neconomics to produce a dominant\nmodern image of humans summarized\nby the phrase “what is best for me is best\nfor the society.” Without rejecting the\nselfish gene view, Cacioppo shows how\nit evolves in humans into what he calls\nthe “social brain’— a large cerebral\ncortex and an interconnected limbic\nlobule that together are sensitive to the\ncomplexities of physical and social\nenvironments. Central to this\ncomplexity is the long period of\ndependency of the human infant and the\ninterdependencies of adult humans for\nsurvival especially in hostile\nenvironments (e.g., warfare). For the\nselfish gene to contribute its DNA to the\nongoing gene pool, the individual must\nnot only reproduce but also cooperate\nwith others to assure that his or her\n\nPage |17\n\noffspring also grow to maturity and\nreproduce. This leads to natural\nselection choosing those genes and\ncapacities that contribute to cooperation,\nreciprocity, attachments, and generosity.\nOver the millennia of human evolution,\nthis process has created the social brain\nand made humans a unique social\nanimal.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021263",
