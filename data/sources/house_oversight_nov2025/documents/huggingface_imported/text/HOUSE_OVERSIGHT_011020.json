  "text": "CHAPTER 5: BRINGING HUMAN CAPITAL IN\n\nHuman capital is labor measured as a dollar sum rather than as so much per hour or\nyear. It treats pay less invested consumption as our cash flow, and finds our present\nvalue (to ourselves) as expected lifetime cash flow discounted by our own time\npreference rates, meaning what we would charge for delay. Measurement in this\nway usually finds it as something near three fourths of all capital. Physical capital,\nmuch better understood because it can be bought and sold as well as hired, is only\nthe visible tip of the iceberg. The term human capital itself is touchy because it can\nsuggest that life has a price. Irving Fisher used it in quotation marks in 1898},\nattributing it to earlier sources | haven’t found, but not in his two great books on the\ntopic in 19062 and 1907. Wikipedia is mistaken in attributing the term to Arthur\n\nPigou a generation later.\n\nHistory of the Idea\n\nThe concept began with Petty in 16644. He estimated the aggregate pay of English\nworkers, and divided by the discount rate he had modeled in A Treatise of Taxes two\nyears earlier. | have not read Verbum Sapienti, but have read two of his later\n\nversions of the same argument>.\n\nPetty’s method was criticized by William Farr in 1854, also in a paper I haven’t read,\nfor neglecting what I call invested consumption. Farr, if] read the right description\nof his argument, was both right and wrong. Petty was modeling human capital of\naggregate workers. These were mostly adults, who no longer receive invested\nconsumption if my model is right. That makes his method sound in principle for\nmeasuring adult human capital separately. It follows that he underestimated the\n\nhuman capital of England, rather than overestimating it as Farr claimed, by leaving\n\n1 The Nature of Capital.\n\n2 The Nature of Capital and Income.\n\n3 The Rate of Interest.\n\n4 Verbum Sapienti.\n\n5 Political Arithmetic (1676) and A Gross Estimate of the Wealth of England (1685).\n6 Vital Statistics.\n\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011020",
