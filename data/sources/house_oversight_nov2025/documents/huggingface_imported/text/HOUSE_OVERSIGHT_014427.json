The insurance sector has been the best performer since the US election on the\nback of a steeper US Treasury curve and higher rates. Michael Hartnett observes\n“violent rotation out of deflation to inflation plays”, including a move from REITs to US\nbanks. This should apply to Japan, where banks and insurance have underperformed\nREITs amid relentless fall of the long-term yield and introduction of negative interest\nrate by the Bo) (Chart 5). The domestic policy condition has changed, however, as the\nBo) is now reluctant to cut rate as it pays greater attention to the health of the financial\ninstitution. The Bo) now intends to prevent the yield curve from flattening excessively.\nWhile higher foreign yields may not lift yen rates as the Bo) controls the 10-year sector,\nreflationary environment outside Japan at least reduces the risk of a deeper cut at home.\nOutperformance of Japanese equities at the time of UST bear steepening has\nhistorically been led by cyclicals, banks and insurance (Exhibit 2). David Gleeson is\ncautious about REITs, while Futoshi Sasaki is constructive on banks. The move can\nstretch further near-term.\n\nExhibit 2: US Treasury curve (2510s) move and market performance (past 43 quarters simple average, %) - USD/JPY, Japan equity (local ccy term), and Japanese cyclical, bank,\ninsurance tend to outperform at the time of UST bear-steepening\n\nDollar MSCI MSscCl\nUSDJPY index — Japan / Japan sector*\n(DXY) ex Japan*\nDiscretion Financials Materials IT Industrials Energy Telecom Staples — Utilities Health\nary care\n\nBear steep 4.12 -0.60 8.58 3.32 11.68 9.97 9.96 9.46 8.58 5.88 3.27 2.86 2.83 1.89\nBear flat 1.90 0.31 3.88 0.58 3.49 -0.44 5.44 4.09 3.88 4.26 3.66 2.34 -0.06 5.21\nBull steep -1.85 -0.35 -2.32 -2.76 -3.03 -2.44 -4.70 4.22 -2.32 -3.46 2.44 1.44 -3.64 -0.47\nBull flat -4.49 1.26 -7.31 -5.05 8.91 -11.10 -9.94 8.23 -7.31 -9.61 -0.37 -1.50 -4.16 -1.59\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nUsed Bloomberg Treasury yield index.\n\nCurve movements defined based on 2yr move (up or down) and 2510s move (up or down) so these include twist movements, but even if we exclude these, implications for USDJPY and Japan equity do not change\nsignificantly.\n\n11 quarters of bear steepening = average 16bps increase in 2yr yields and 33bps 2510s steepening; 10 quarters of bear flattening = average 26bps increase in 2yr yields and 20bps 2s10s flattening; 10 quarters of bull\nsteepening = average 48bps decline in 2yr yields and 28bps 2510s steepening; 12 quarters of bull flattening = average 27bps decline in 2yr yields and 30bps 2s 10s flattening\n\nJapan / ex-Japan = MSCl Japan / MSCI Kokusai ratio\n\nJapanese sectors follow MSCI definition\n\nChart 6: If inflation, rates surprise to upside, Japanese banks likely to outperform REITs\n\n2.3\n2.1\n\n07\n\n0.5\nNov-06  Nov-07  Nov-08  Nov-09 Nov-10  Nov-11 Nov-12  Nov-13.
