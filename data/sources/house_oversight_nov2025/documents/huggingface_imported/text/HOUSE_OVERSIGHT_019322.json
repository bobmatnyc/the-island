Objective: an alliance\nbetween right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections\n\nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru\nwho was Donald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following\nthe racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the\nDaily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in the\nheart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view\nof the European elections which will be held in spring 2019.\n\nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor\nof the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in\nsupport of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist\nright, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in\norder to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current\nMinister of the Interior Matteo Salvini.\n\nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in\nthe European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and\nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of which he\nhas long since been dreaming.\n\nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic\nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European\nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling\nfunding.\n\nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a\nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May.\n\nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The\nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress\n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data\nstolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump\nemerged victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019322",
