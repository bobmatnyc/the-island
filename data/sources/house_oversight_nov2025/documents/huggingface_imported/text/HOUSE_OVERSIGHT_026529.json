These are the same condition needed for CWL and ONLYL, respectively, and,\nas discussed above, these ranges is strictly smaller than the range of values over which\nCWOL is an equilibrium.\n\nTo summarize, CWOL can occur in equilibrium, and this equilibrium is subgame per-\nfect, is stable, and has a sizable basin of attraction in the replicator dynamics. Moreover,\nwe expect player 2 to prefer interacting with player 1s who do not look and player 1s to\nactively avoid looking when defection is harmful and the temptation to defect is usually\nsmall but sometimes huge. Finally, under these conditions, cooperation can be sustained\nonly if player 1 can avoid looking and player 2 can observe whether player 1 looks.\n\nWhile we modeled player 1 looking at the temptation to defect, we could analogously\nhave modeled player 1 looking at the benefits to cooperating. This can be interpreted as\nlooking to see if anyone is watching, asking what one will get, or calculating the value of\nthe ongoing relationship. In this and some similar cases, the modifications to the model\nwould be straightforward and analysis would be equivalent.\n\nWe now apply the model to shed light on a number of interesting phenomena, including\nwhy we dislike “flip-flopping” politicians and respect principled people more generally, why\npeople cooperate intuitively, why people feel disgust when considering taboo trade-offs,\nand why people fall in love.\n\nWe trust candidates for political office whose policies are the result of their convictions\nand are consistent over time, and distrust those whose policies are carefully constructed\nin consultation with their pollsters and who “flip-flop” in response to public opinion, as\ncaricatured by the infamous 2004 Republican presidential campaign television ad showing\nJohn Kerry wind-surfing, and tacking from one direction to another. At first glance, this\nseems irrational: one would think it a virtue for a politician to flexibly respond to public\n\nopinion once in office. This logic is illustrated by John Maynard Keynes’ famous quote:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026529",
