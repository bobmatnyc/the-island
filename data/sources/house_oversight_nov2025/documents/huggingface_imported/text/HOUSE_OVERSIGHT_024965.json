  "text": "questioning and often perplexed, has none of the certainties of a man\nborn to power. He was a young doctor studying ophthalmology in\nLondon when the accidental death in 1994 of his elder brother, Basil,\nan altogether tougher character who was being groomed for the\nsuccession, propelled him somewhat reluctantly onto the political\nscene.\n\nThe country he came to rule in 2000 seemed backward in an\nincreasingly globalised and technologically advanced world. His first\nreforms were therefore financial and commercial. Mobile phones and\nthe internet were introduced. Private schools and universities\nproliferated. In 2004 private banks and insurance companies were\nallowed to operate for the first time, and a stock exchange was\nopened in March 2009. A political and economic alliance was forged\nwith Turkey (and visas abolished), which allowed trade to grow along\nthat border, benefiting Aleppo. The Old City of Damascus was\nrevitalised, ancient courtyard houses restored and hotels and\nrestaurants opened to cater for the growing number of tourists. Before\nthe crisis erupted, Syria was negotiating to join the World Trade\nOrganisation and conclude an association agreement with the\nEuropean Union.\n\nBut Bashar’s years in power seem to have hardened him. He\ndeveloped a taste for control -- control over the media, over the\nuniversity, over the economy (through cronies such as his\nexorbitantly rich cousin Rami Makhlouf), control over society at\nlarge. Free expression is not allowed. Political decision-making is\nrestricted to a tight circle around the president and security services.\nLike his father, Bashar clearly does not like to be pushed around or to\nseem to yield to pressure. Even so, many Syrians still support him in\nthe belief that, as an educated, modern and secular ruler, he is better\nplaced than most to bring about necessary change.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024965",
