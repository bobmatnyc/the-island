  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nAssisting Mercy Suicide\n\nAnother highly emotional case in which science was used to establish the immediate cause of\ndeath involved the mercy killing by a doctor of his cancer-ridden wife.\n\nAlthough the media characterized Patricia Rosier’s death as a “mercy killing,” it is more aptly\ndescribed as a “mercy suicide,” because she alone made the decision to end her life. A mercy\nsuicide, when committed by an adult of sound mind, is not a crime.\n\nMercy killing—the taking of the life of another person who is suffering and usually no longer\nsentient—is different from mercy suicide in the eyes of the law. The letter of the law simply does\nnot recognize mercy as a defense to murder: it regards all deliberate killings as murder, whether\ndone in the name of love or hate. But suicide is not a crime, though in some religions, it is\nregarded as a sin.\n\nThe line between mercy suicide and mercy killing is not always clear. Sometimes it is simply a\nfunction of timing or happenstance. When what was originally intended as an unassisted mercy\nsuicide cannot be completed without the help of others, it becomes, in the eyes of a prosecutor, a\ncriminal mercy killing.”\n\nWhat began as a clear case of mercy suicide by Patricia Rosier ended up with the trial of her\nhusband, Peter, for first-degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and attempted murder. The\nprosecutor sought the death penalty, analogizing the crime to “a serialized gang murder.”\n\nThe basic facts were not in dispute, but the legal consequences of those facts gave rise to one of\nthe most contentious and emotional cases in Florida legal history.\n\nAfter being told she had incurable cancer and had only weeks to live in excruciating pain, Patricia\nmade the fateful decision to pick the time and circumstances of her death, not wanting to leave it\nto the unpredictable clock of the cancer. When she told her husband of her decision, Peter said\n\n7° There is a third category that combines mercy killings with mercy suicides. In another one of my cases, a\n\nmother engaged in the combined act of trying to kill her autistic and sexually abused son and trying to kill herself.\nShe succeeded in the former and failed in the latter. She reasonably believed that the child’s biological father was\nrepeatedly abusing the 8 year old autistic boy and that her former husband was planning to kill her, which would\nleave the child in the hands of his father.\n\nThis phenomenon too has a name: altruistic filicide-suicide. At bottom it is a genre of mercy killing, although one\nwith possible legal defenses of necessity (choice of evils) and justification (killing to protect her son). That case is\n\npending as I write these words.\n\n192\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017279",
