  "text": "For instance, developers were surprised to\nfind out that, by a quirk in the West Bank's\nnotoriously Byzantine and palimpsestic\nlegal codes, they required the approval of a\njoint Israeli-Palestinian water commission\ncreated through the Oslo Accords to build a\nsewage treatment plant in an Area A,\napproval that they recently received.\nThere's also the still-unresolved matter of\nthe access road. But thus far, Rawabi had\nflourished in spite of delays and\ninconveniences.\n\nCould it survive its isolation, though --\ncould this hilltop off of a two-lane highway\nget enough water and electricity to support\n45,000 people living at a middle class\nstandard? \"There is nothing here at all.\nWe're out in the boondocks,\" he conceded.\n\"We're building everything from scratch.\"\nOne needed only to glance at the busy\nconstruction site below to understand that\nMasri considers this a point of pride, far\nfrom a potential death-sentence for his\nproject.\n\nI asked Masri about something that had\njumped out at me during the 3-D video.\nThe finished Rawabi, I'd noted, had the\nsame terraced garden parks, stoic, modular\napartment design, and concentric hilltop\nroads that I had seen in Talpiyot Misrach, a\nnew neighborhood on the fringes of West\nJerusalem. His city looked very, well,\nIsraeli.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025082",
