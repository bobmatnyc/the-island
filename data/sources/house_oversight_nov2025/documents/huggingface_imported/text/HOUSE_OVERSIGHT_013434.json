That's unusual. And it's very unusual that they structure a plea to get county time rather than\nprison time. That's definitely out of the ordinary. Nobody goes to county jail as a state criminal punishment.\"\n\n-- mdargan\n\n@pbdailynews.com\nGRAPHIC: Caption: Epstein Deal does not allow prosecution of co- conspirators.\n\nLOAD-DATE: September 1, 2010\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013434",
