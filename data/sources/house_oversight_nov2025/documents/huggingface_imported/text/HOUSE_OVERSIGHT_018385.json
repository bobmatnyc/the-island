  "text": "from dozens of hereditary principalities, was the ceaseless ping-ping of rail-building\nand welding and industry. How natural it must have seemed to add the rat-a-tat-tat\nof a Maxim gun. Crown Prince Wilhelm, the Kaiser's eldest son, wrote that defensive\nthinking was, “utterly foreign to the German spirit.” Bismarck’s “Iron and Blood”\nnational motto became, finally, personal for many Germans, who were prouder to\nleave their universities with a hot-red dueling scar on their faces than a subtle\nownership of Goethe in their hearts.\n\n“During the decades before the First World War,” the political scientist Steven van\nEvera has observed, “a phenomenon which may be called a ‘cult of the offensive’\nswept through Europe.”225 Wars, it was believed, would run with the same swiftness\nof trains or the new industrial sewing machines or steam-fired printing presses. It\nwas this instinct that led German generals to assure the Kaiser in 1914 that a war\nbegun in August would be finished by Christmas. English university students\nsprinted to enlistment centers in the days after the war began, worried the fight\nmight end before they tasted blood. French farmers moving from their crops to the\ntrench lines of Flanders, Russian aristocracy crowding towards the Danube, the\npoliticians who led them all - they operated, mostly, with this same conviction.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey’s mournful meditation on the evening of\nAugust 3,1914, the first night of the war, was a lonely one: “The lamps are going out\nall over Europe,” he said. “We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.”\n\nThe First World War was a kind of engineering tragedy. The disaster had deep roots:\ndomestic politics, the insecurity of kings, profound colonial greed. But alsoa\nfundamental miscalculation about the nature of war and peace in an age of industry.\nMachine guns - and all the tools of industrial war, from gas to battleships - were not\nmagic tricks of fast victory or permanent peace, as some had thought. A mechanized\nmodern army wasn’t, as much as it may have seemed in theory or drills or in\nmidnight massacres in the African bush, some steam-press built for cold rolling the\narmies Belgium and Prussia and France. In fact, the weapons encouraged battle as\nthey piled endlessly in national arsenals. They tickled fears of fast or surprise attack,\neven as they gratified that weird continental hunger for violence. Hilare Beloc’s\npoetic joke, the sly we’ve got the Maxim, and they've not took on an unexpected\ncharacter when both sides had ‘em. The machine gun reached the fiery acme of its\npurpose not as a spur to end wars altogether, as Gatling once hoped, but rather\nwhen it was married to barbed wire, to shovels and to gas - and then admixed with\nthe trigger-tugging fear of 20-year-old boys. So: Sixty thousand British casualties in\none day alone, July 1, 1916 at the Somme.\n\nThe rhymes changed. Hilare Beloc’s jigs were a distant memory for the starved,\nsurprised and shocked men in the field. Siegfried Sassoon:\n\nYou smug faced crowds, with kindling eye\nWho cheer when soldier lads march by,\n\n225 “During the decades”: Steven Van Evera, “Cult of the Offensive and the Origins\nof the First World War”, International Security (Vol 9, No 1, Summer 1984) 58\n\n153\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018385",
