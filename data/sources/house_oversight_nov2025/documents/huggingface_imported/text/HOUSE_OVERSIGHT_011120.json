  "text": "notion that they ever were rests pretty much on evidence bolstered by government\nsubsidies such as FHA and FNMA and FMAC which began before I was born. As itis, I\ndon’t see enough evidence either way to assert whether houses or the publicly\ntraded corporate sector, cap-weighting its stock and bonds, should be risker. But\n\neven that uncertainly is a surprise in view of what we all were taught.\n\nDepreciation theory is one of my favorites. It doesn’t upset the applecart as much as\nthe pay rule does, because little economic theory depends on it. I love it because it\nreverses tradition precisely. National accounts model depreciation as declining\nexponentially. | model it as rising exponentially. It’s the same equation with a plus\nsign in place of a minus sign. | love its obviousness once we think about it. It follows\nwhen we remember the present value rule. Once we do, evidence for both factors\nmakes more sense. Depreciation theory rounds out the pay rule in explaining how\npay can rise or hold steady to the very end. And we see the same in businesses.\nGross realized profit, analogous to pay, does not tend to decline as firms approach a\ndate with the wrecking ball. My impression has been that rents go down when\nproperties aren't kept up or locations become unfashionable, but not with age in\nitself. When it’s time to demolish and rebuild, premises are more typically vacated\nwith trade still running at norms. Gross realized profit is inevitably all depreciation\n\non the last day, and would approach zero steadily if tradition were right.\n\nThere may have been minor novelty in my derivation of my three fundamental\ntheorems as at least subjective certitudes following from definitions, and in my idea\nitself of subjective as distinct from empirical certitude. A subjective certitude is one\nsuch that contrary evidence would falsify the convergence axioms. | have found little\nor no empirical certitude past the cogito. | concede that the idea of subjective\n\ncertitude is impertinent. How dare we infer what people must think?\n\nWe dare when we infer from definitions. | began with the somewhat unusual\ndefinition of capital (value) as perceived means of foreseen taste satisfactions. The\n\nusual “means of production” is equally valid, but less suited to my purpose here. |\n\nChapter 9: So What ‘s New? 3/17/16 4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011120",
