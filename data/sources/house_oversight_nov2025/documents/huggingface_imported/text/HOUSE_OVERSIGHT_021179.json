  "text": "such high prospects lowering herself to something of Jeffrey’s standards,\nbut I later found out through Jeffrey that he had donated money to her\ncontinuous exploration into marine life and habitats. She had followed in\nher family’s footsteps, all of them involved in Marine Biology in some\nway or another. We actually got along really well, she was a real decent\ngirl, and loved talking about her passion, everything underneath the\nwaters surface.\n\nWhen I wasn’t busy giving massages to everyone around, her and I\nwould hang out together. Often we go swimming in the crystal clear pool\nof ocean that the Caribbean had to offer. Once we swam out so far not\npaying attention to our location and were carried out to sea by the current.\nWe took tums on the backs of each other, taking breaks against the strong\nocean tide. It was almost a possibility that we nearly drowned out there, if\nit weren’t for some guys on a boat out fishing for the day when they\ncaught us in their view. They picked us up and brought us back to the\nisland where we were reprimanded by a worried Jeffrey and Ghislane to\nfirst of all let someone know where we are going at all times, and never\nto lose sight of the shore while out for a swim. After that learning\nexperience | took their heed and proceeded with caution. [ had a\nnewfound respect for the ocean and it’s mysteries.\n\nHaving such a lover of the water as a guest, made Jeffrey want to\nexplore parts of his Caribbean he had never seen before. The next\nmorning we were met by a scuba instructor in St. James and given a few\nlessons in how to use the gear and more tips like how to descend slowly\nto the ocean floor as not to cause blood clots as well as visual hand\nsignals to communicate underwater. It was so exhilarating beneath the\nwaters surface. No voices to listen too, only the enchanting sights to take\nin. We explored the surrounding reef and found a large squid, many of\nsea urchins, and the magnificent colored coral that housed a many of the\nrich variety of the local species of fish. It was such a great sight to take\nin. Holding a permanent mental picture of those adventures to carry in my\nhead for all times.\n\nWe all had such a great time that Jeffrey hired the same scuba\ninstructor to come out the next day to scuba dive the safer parts around\nhis island. We got bored quickly with not much to see but seaweed and a\nfish here and there. It didn’t take long before Ghislane decided for us all\nto explore other numerous locations by boat, Jeffrey needed a bit of\nconvincing at first and the instructor was quick to assure him that he\nknew his way well around these waters, of course he would say that, he\nwas getting paid a hell of lot to do this in the first place, why not extend\nit a few more hours?\n\nThe clear water glistened and the tropical array of marine life was on\ndisplay as we wanted to stop at so many places but you could see as\n\n69\n\nbeautiful as it was it could be as equally dangerous. [t took so long as we\nhad to veer away from so many desirable spots. Finally we found a good\nplace that the scuba instructor thought was safe. He buddied us up into\npairs and we jumped off the back of the boat into the crystal aqua blue\nwaters beginning our descent slowly into the darker regions of the oceans\nfloor. We were situated on open water with a cavern of reefs to venture in\nand around down below. It seemed to be quite a choice to scuba in, one\nthat our guide said he wasn’t familiar with but to alleviate his bored\nclientele deemed safe to swim around.\n\nIt was Jeffrey and the Guide together, Ghislane and Emmy, and I was\npaired up with Alexandria. Miles, the houseman, came with us and stayed\non the boat just in case something went wrong and lucky he did. We were\nall too far under the water to hear his alarming screams of distress when\nshadow’s lurking in the murky distance started appearing closer and\ncloser. Ghislane actually looked frightened for once as she gave us the\nsignal to start ascending upwards, reminding us by holding her ears not to\ngo up to quick or as we were previously warned before we could pop a\nblood vessel in our brain and hemorrhage to death, not a very lovely\nimage but neither was getting torn apart by sharks. Those giant shadows\nbecame clearer and soon enough we could recognize their indistinct\nspecies as the terrifying and more aggressive breed of sharks, the\nhammerhead. Grabbing Miles hand | was the last one ahead of the Guide\nto get on the boat imaging the worst as I waited behind Emmy and\nAlexandria who were the next to follow after Jeffrey and Ghislane I was\nin too much shock to scream or cry, | just told myself I had to stay calm\nto get out of this alive. Unlucky for us we found out later on that we were\nin their breeding territory and being sent a clear message that we were\nsoon to be on the menu to their feeding frenzy.\n\nWe all felt like we had cheated death and I know it wasn’t only my\nheart that was still beating out of my chest when we headed back to\n\nJeffrey’s island. Jeffrey was pale as his designer sheets and looked like he\n\nhad aged another ten years in such a scared state. Ghislane took the heat\noff herself even barely taking a notice of beforehand and decided to poke\nfun at all of us frantically scurrying to get out of the water, it was just her\nnature, as I had never seen her move so quickly either. We got back to the\nisland and all collapsed our fatigued bodies in our own beds for a long\nnap. Freshened up and much more relaxed we regaled our horrendous\nstory again over dinner, this time in laughter. The following afternoon\nGhislane piloted us all in the helicopter to St. John’s Airport and we said\ngood-bye to Alexandra where we all parted ways. I met her a few more\nseparate times in Palm Beach at Jeffrey’s Mansion, but she wasn't a\nregular of his, probably not as easy as the troubled girls were to bribe.\n\n70\n\n!
