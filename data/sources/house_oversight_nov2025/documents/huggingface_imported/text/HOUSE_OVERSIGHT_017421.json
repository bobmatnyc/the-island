  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nThe Guild decided to abandon any pretense of reporting neutrally on human rights and has\ncontinued to serve only as the legal and political arm of the hard left. It has now lost all of its\ncredibility as a human rights organization.\n\nNor was the Guild alone in shifting from “a purely human rights perspective” to a largely political\nperspective that used the label of human rights selectively against its ideological enemies. Other\norganizations which were founded on the principles of neutral human rights, such as Human\nRights Watch,'” the Carter Center and Amnesty International,\n\n'® As an early supporter of Human Rights Watch and an admirer of its founder, I have taken upon myself\nthe responsibility of monitoring its actions very carefully—of guarding the guardians. I was particularly\ncritical of its reporting on Israel’s war against Hezbollah in 20___, after Hezbollah fired thousands of\nrockets at civilian targets in the north of Israel.\n\nI focused on the highly publicized “conclusion” reached by Human Rights Watch allegedly after extensive\n“imvestigations” on the ground:\n\n“Human Rights Watch found no cases in which Hezbollah deliberately used civilians as shields\nto protect them from retaliatory IDF attack.” (emphasis added)\n\nAfter investigating a handful of cases, Human Rights Watch found that in “none of the cases of civilian\ndeaths documented in this report [Qana, Srifa, Tyre, and southern Beirut] is there evidence to suggest that\nHezbollah forces or weapons were in or near the area that the IDF targeted during or just prior to the\nattack.”\n\nNo cases! None! Not one! That’s what Human Rights watch reported to the world.\n\nBut anyone who watched even a smattering of TV during the war saw with their own eyes direct evidence\nof rockets being launched from civilian areas. Not Human Rights Watch. “Who are you going to believe,\nme or your lying eyes?” That’s not Chico Marx. It’s Human Rights Watch. Their lying eyes belonged to\nthe pro-Hezbollah witnesses its investigators chose to interview—and claimed to believe. But their\nmendacious pens belonged to Kenneth Roth, HRW’s Executive Director, and his minions in New York,\nwho know how to be skeptical when it serves their interests not to believe certain witnesses. How could an\norganization, which claims to be objective, have been so demonstrably wrong about so central a point in\nso important a war? Could it have been an honest mistake? I don’t think so. Despite its boast that\n“Human Rights Watch has interviewed victims and witness of attacks in on-on-one settings, conducted on-\nsite inspections ... and collected information for hospitals, humanitarian groups, and government\nagencies,” it didn’t find one instance in which Hezbollah failed to segregate its fighters from civilians.\n\nIn arriving at this counter-factual conclusion, Human Rights Watch willfully ignored credible news\nsources, such as The New York Times, The New Yorker and other sources.\n\nAfter I exposed the double standard practiced by Human Rights Watch, its founder, Robert Bernstein, wrote the\nfollowing in the New York Times.\n\nAs the founder of Human Rights Watch, its active chairman for 20 years and now founding chairman\nemeritus, I must do something that I never anticipated: I must publicly join the group’s critics. Human\nRights Watch had as its original mission to pry open closed societies, advocate basic freedoms and support\ndissenters. But recently it has been issuing reports on the Israeli-Arab conflict that are helping those who\nwish to turn Israel into a pariah state.\n\nIsrael, with a population of 7.4 million, is home to at least 80 human rights organizations, a vibrant free\npress, a democratically elected government, a judiciary that frequently rules against the government, a\n\n334\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017421",
