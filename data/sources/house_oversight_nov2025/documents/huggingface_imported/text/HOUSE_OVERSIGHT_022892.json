  "text": "life and the scandal.\n\nIt is a curious attribute of his character that, other than\nperhaps being more circumspect about what legal advice\nto follow, Epstein would not have done anything\ndifferently. (When I suggested recently to Epstein that\none obvious way to blunt the animus bearing down on\nhim would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back\nto jail.) His life, living it as he wants, seems to him to be\nan extraordinary accomplishment. Being on the wrong\nside of morality, custom, politics, feminists, the media,\nthat’s just a bit of bad luck.\n\nAnd it is perhaps this attitude of his that irks his\ncritics the most.

Epstein is\ntheir confidant. Not the only nexus of them, but one of\nthem. Dr. Epstein. Lay on my couch. As he is\neverybody’s confident, everybody becomes his\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022892",
