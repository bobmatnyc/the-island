Bullet-headed and\naggressive in stance, he said a lot of valuable things -- particularly about how men ought\nto take ownership of problems we traditionally consider \"women's issues.\" It's certainly\ntrue that if we want to end male abuse of women, men must participate in the movement.\nBut although Katz discussed some issues of masculinity, I heard little about how we can\nmake things better for men. His proposition of a men's movement was centered around\ncorrecting the things some men are doing wrong.\n\nAlthough they're often watered down, many feminist concepts have gone mainstream.\nFor instance, Americans have some consciousness of traditional feminist critiques about\nhow women's bodies are represented in the media. Indeed, that consciousness has become\nso endemic that, in a grandly ironic twist, marketers now capitalize on it to sell beauty\nproducts: the nationwide Dove Campaign for Real Beauty attempts to use\ndeconstruction of the media's representation of women to sell Dove soap. Americans\nare also quite aware of men as the privileged class -- sometimes regarded outright as the\noppressors.\n\nBut this shift in awareness about gender issues faced by women has not been\naccompanied by a widespread understanding of gender issues faced by men. And that\ncreates situations like an activist working towards a masculinity movement that talks\nmainly about how men are hurting women, or a trans man who has trouble with the idea\nof transitioning partly because he doesn't want to be a white man -- one of the oppressors.\n\nHow can awareness of oppressive dynamics make it difficult for men to own their\nmasculinity? Does male privilege ever make life harder for men? When does male\nprivilege blind us to oppression of masculinity? There's some mainstream awareness of\ngender issues faced by women; is there any similar awareness of the problems of\nmasculinity?\n\nA good friend of mine first caught my attention by talking about gender. We encountered\neach other ata BDSM meetup, and when I mentioned that I'd been thinking about the\nboxes around masculine sexuality, he launched into a rant about oppressive sexual\ndynamics. He gave me references to complex sexuality blogs and intelligently used\nwords like \"heteronormative\" and \"patriarchy.\" But a month or so after we started talking,\nI mentioned his interest in gender issues... and he gave me a puzzled look. \"I'm not really\ninto gender studies,” he said.\n\nHe talks about sex, gender and culture all the time -- but he also specifically identifies as\nhighly masculine, and felt that to be at odds with identifying as someone who questions\nmasculinity. As Thomas Millar writes in his aforementioned article: \"There's a huge\nunstated assumption that to even address the question [of male sexuality], for men, is to\nmark one's self as ‘other.’ ... cis het men are brought up to fear that their masculinity could\never be called into question. By even opening up a dialog, I think some folks fear that\nthey are conceding that their sexuality is not uncontroversial.”\n\nMen currently experience this problem in a way that women do not. In other words,\nwomen don't risk being seen as unfeminine as easily as men risk being seen as\nunmasculine; nor do we have quite the same fears about it. In 2008, a group of\nresearchers published a paper called \"Precarious Manhood.” Their concluding statement:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018576",
