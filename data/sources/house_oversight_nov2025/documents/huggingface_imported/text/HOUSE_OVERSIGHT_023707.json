We have to look at the\nshort-term, mid-term, and longterm.\nLet’s look at the\nbackground to understand where\nChina is today. This is the 40 th\nyear, the anniversary, of China’s\nreform and opening up. On\nDecember 18 th , 1978, Deng\nXiaoping made his famous\nspeech, which transformed China\nfrom ideologically driven class\nstruggle into economic\ndevelopment. It’s a big deal in\nChina; there’s a big celebration\ncoming up.\nRLK: President Xi Jinping has said\nthat the first big goal for China, in\n2020, is to have a moderately\nprosperous society, specifically to\neliminate all extreme poverty in\nChina. That means they will have\ntaken 800 million people out of\npoverty. So that’s their overview,\nand so they look at the status quo\nthat they’ve had with America as\nsomething that’s good for both\nsides.\n3\nRLK: As for America, we have\ncritical issues that we have to\ndeal with: Open markets, IP\nprotection, forced technology\ntransfer, cyber security / cyber\ntheft — there are a lot of issues\non the table.\nQuest: The two sides are seeing\nFriday’s deal in very different\nways.\nRLK: That always happens —\nQuest: But the Chinese —\nRLK: That’s diplomacy. That’s the\ndefinition — we saw that in the\nspy plane collision in 2001; we\nsaw that in the bombing of the\nYugoslavian embassy in 1999.\n4\nRLK: Both sides had\ndifferent\ninterpretations to suit\ntheir domestic\nmarkets.\nQuest: But they’re not\neven admitting, or at\nleast acknowledging,\na 90 days. Let alone\nall this business of,\n“we’re going to buy\nmore cars.”\nRLK: Well, look. In\nChina, there is a\ndebate among\nChinese economists,\nwhat’s good for\nChina? Many\neconomists tell me\nprivately, personally,\none-on-one, like I’m\ntalking to you right\nnow, that China\nneeds to open its\nmarkets, it needs to\nhave IP protection, it\nshouldn’t support\nstate-owned\nenterprises as much.\nBut they have\ninternal debate.\n5\nRLK: Those Chinese\neconomists are pleased to\nsee this pressure going on,\nbut China cannot admit\nthat publicly, because that\nundermines the\nrejuvenation of China, the\nstrength of the\ngovernment, the national\npride.\nRLK: We have to\nunderstand both sides are\nspeaking to their domestic\naudiences, but hopefully,\nwhen they get together\nprivately, they’ll talk\nbusiness.\n6\nQuest: Do you believe that\nthey can and or will make\nthe structural changes\nnecessary to get a longterm\ndeal, because it seems\nas if President Trump is not\ngoing to be satisfied longterm\nwith agreeing to buy a\nfew extra bits of this or\nthat of agriculture.\nRLK: I totally agree with\nthat, and I think that’s\nright. We’re going to have\nto see. I mean, it’s easy to\npredict 10 years in the\nfuture, but not 10 days. So\nwe’ll see where we go.\n7\nRLK: But the people in\nChina whom I talk with say\nthey recognize that this\ntime is different. And what\nthey’re going to do is\nthey’re going to focus on\nthe changes that they\nbelieve are good for China.\nYou actually saw that in\nsome of the\nannouncements today.\nWe’re going to do the kinds\nof things that help our\ndomestic economy as well.\nThat sounds like it’s a play\nfor their own domestic\naudiences — to show\nthey’re not conceding — but\nin fact it is really the case.\n8\nQuest: The U.S.\npresident talked\nabout selling\nlarge amounts of\nagriculture to the\nChinese, and\ntariffs on\nautomobiles\ndown from 40%\nmaybe to 0%.\nThis is\nmercantilist stuff.\nThis isn’t “trade\ndeal.”\nRLK: Totally\nagree with that.\nAnd those are\nsuperficial things,\nthey make\nheadlines, they’re\neasy to\nunderstand, but\nthey’re not the\nsubstance of\nwhat’s happening\nhere.\n9\nQuest: Do you\nbelieve that\nthere’s a shift in\nperspective in this,\nthis dinner shifted\nthings?\nRLK: I believe\nthere has been a\nshift; I wouldn’t\ntell you the dinner\ndid it, but over\ntime, there is\nrecognition that\nthis time is\ndifferent.\nQuest: Thank you,\nsir. Next time,\nwhen it’s different,\nyou’ll come back\nand tell us.\nRLK: Absolutely.\nQuest: Okay, good.\nGood to see you;\nthank you.\n10",
