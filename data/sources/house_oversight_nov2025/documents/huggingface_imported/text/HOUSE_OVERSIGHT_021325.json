  "text": "monkey had learned to pucker up his\nlips, the neuron would fire both when the\nmonkey did this or when the monkey\nobserved another monkey (or even a\nhuman) doing this. These motor neurons\nhave been dubbed “mirror neurons”,\nsince they respond during both execution\nof action and during observation of the\nsame action in a mirror-like fashion.’\nMirror neurons are not active during\nobservation of an appropriate action if\nthere is no goal (1.e., the object is absent)\nor when an appropriate object is\npresented alone. Mirror neurons have\nbeen discovered both for mouth actions\nand hand actions, and for both visual and\nauditory perception of actions.\n\nSeeing a previously learned\naction performed by someone else seems\nto resonate in some neurons in the motor\nsystem almost as if the action were being\nperformed by the observer. It is as if the\nobserved action stimulates some motor\nneurons to “remember” what it was like\nto perform action. Of course, this is not\nmemory in the overt sense of conscious\nrecollection, but rather that the\nexperience of execution changes the\nresponse of the neurons to observation.\nNot all the motor neurons respond this\nway but a small number have been\nshown to respond when performing and\nobserving an action. Such mirror\nneurons could provide a correspondence\nbetween the experience one has of\nperforming an action and seeing the\nsame action performed by others.\n\nThese mirror neurons might\nprovide one basis for understanding\naction. Relating actions we observe to\nactions we have carried out seems like\nan important component for\ncomprehension. After all, we knew what\nwe were doing when we performed an\naction. If that experience is somehow\nreinstated during observation we might\n\nPage |79\n\nattribute our past experience as the\ninterpretation of the present observation.\nImitation when observing an action\nmight occur because our motor system is\nstimulated by observing an action.\nCoordination of action could occur\nbecause in representing others’ actions\nas if they were our own, our brains may\nbe able to compute the time when we\ncan act without disrupting the other\nperson. This is just the kind of process\nthat is described in Gun Semin’s chapter\nwhen he describes how groups of people\ncan synchronize their actions like\nclapping together.\n\nFrom monkey brains to human\nintention\n\nOf course, relating responses in\nmonkey brains to human brains is\nneither direct nor simple. Parts of the\nmonkey brain and and parts of the\nhuman brain that putatively correspond,\nwhile similar, are not identical in\nnumber or size or location, and probably\ndo not do exactly the same things, since\nmonkeys and humans have evolved to\nhave somewhat different capacities and\nbehaviors. Furthermore, the study of\nmirror neurons in monkeys is based on\nrecording the responses of individual\nneurons, which is not generally possible\nin humans except in rare cases of\nmedical necessity. The measures we can\nmake on intact human brains come from\nthe responses of many thousands of\nneurons, so it is difficult to make claims\nabout neurons that respond in producing\nan action and perceiving the same\naction. This means that any claims about\nhuman mirror neurons depend on a\ndegree of good faith and inference rather\nthan specific empirical demonstration\nthat individual neurons respond both to\nobserving and executing action.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021325",
