11 Places With a Worse Economy Than USA
By Rick Newman — Fri Jul 10, 11:50 am ET

When times are tough, one thing that tends to raise the spirits is knowing that somebody else has it worse. And as wretched as the
U.S. economy seems, it's not as bad as in other regions.

The International Monetary Fund's latest tally of world economic conditions forecasts a 2.6 decline in U.S. economic output for all of
2009, and anemic growth of 0.8 percent in 2010. That's more optimistic than the IMF's prediction from three months ago, but those
are still lousy numbers. A weak economy throughout 2010 would mean a bleak employment picture, an agonizingly slow housing
recovery, and another year or two likely to feel like a recession, whether it's technically labeled that or not.
We should count ourselves lucky, though. The IMF expects at least 11 major parts of the world to have more severe economic
contractions than the United State this year, including most of western Europe, Japan, Russia, and Mexico. Europe will still be
stumbling along behind the United States next year, as well. Here are the IMF's projections for economic growth in various parts of
the world:

2009. 2010
China. 75. 85
India. 54 65
Middle East 2.0 3.7
Africa. 1.8 4.7
Brazil. -1.3 2.5
World total -1.4 2.5
Canada. -2.3 1.6
US. -2.6 0.8
France. -3.0 0.4
Spain. -4.0 -0.8
U.K. 4.2 0.2

EU. -4.7 -0.1
