  "text": "KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\n\nMr. Epstein is Required to Ag ree to Civil Liability In Order to Avoid a Federal Indictment\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\nOn July 31, 2007, during negotiations over a possible federal plea agreement, FAUSA\nSloman and AUSA Villafana demanded that Mr. Epstein agree to the imposition of civil\nlability under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 as a pre-condition to deferral of federal prosecution. To\nthe best of our knowledge, the inclusion of such a term in a deferred prosecution\nagreement of this kind is absolutely unprecedented? Specifically, Ms. Villafana\ndemanded that Mr. Epstein waive the right to contest civil liability to a list of individuals\nshe said were “victims” of § 2255, whose names, however, she refused to disclose, and\nagree to pay damages of a minimum of $150,000 to each and every one of such\nundisclosed individuals, and hire an attorney to represent them if they decided to sue\nhim. See Tab 20, July 31, 2007 Draft of Deferred Prosecution Agreement.\n\nFAUSA Sloman and AUSA Villafana insisted that the identities of the individuals on the\nlist not be disclosed to Mr. Epstein or his counsel until after Mr. Epstein was already\nsentenced in the state case.\n\n(a) Over the next two months, Mr. Sloman refused to negotiate these terms. They\nultimately became incorporated into the final deferred prosecution agreement.\nSee Tab 21, September 24, 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement, {{ 7-11.\n\n(b) It was not until seven months later, in February 2008, that Epstein’s lawyers were\nable to take their first official statement from one of the women FAUSA Sloman\nalleged were minor victims of federal offenses.\n\n(c) This statement, a deposition of | the initial complainant in the state\ncase, taken in the presence of her lawyer, proved that none of the necessary\nelements for any federal charge could be satisfied based on  bricf\ncontact with Mr. Epstein. The witness also admitted lying to Mr. Epstein,\ntestifying that she told him that she was an adult and wanted him to believe that\nshe was an adult. See Tab 13, (deposition), p. 35 (“Q. So you\ntold Jeff that you were 18 years old, correct? A. Yes.”), 37 (“Q. You wanted Mr.\nEpstein to believe that you really were 18, right? A. Correct.”).\n\n(d) Shortly after this deposition, the defense was able to obtain statements from other\nwomen on Mr. Sloman’s so called “list of § 2255 victims” and, so far, all such\nstatements also continue to demonstrate that Mr. Sloman’s repeated\nrepresentations to the defense about the existence of federal jurisdiction were\nfalse.\n\nunderstand that Villafana was recently reprimanded at a special hearing convened by a United States District\nJudge in the West Palm Beach Division of the Southern District of Florida, for making misrepresentations\nduring a prior sentencing proceeding.\n\nIn fact, Stephanie Thacker, a former deputy to CEOS Chief Drew Oosterbaan, has stated that she knew of no\nother case like this being prosecuted by CEOS.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012162",
