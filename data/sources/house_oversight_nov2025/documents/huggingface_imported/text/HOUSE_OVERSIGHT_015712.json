Intel\ndemonstrated the first three-dimensional chip in 2004, and these chips\nshould begin to appear in our laptops by around 2020.\n\nTaking a chip into the third dimension solves the economic\nproblem but adding logic gates to a 3D chip presents a new problem\n— heat. Heat is generated in proportion to the volume of the chip but\nit can only be lost through the surface area. Result: the chip overheats.\nLarge animals have the same problem which is why elephants have huge\nears, filled with blood vessels, they can flap to cool themselves and really\nbig mammals, such as whales, live in the ocean. The thermal problem\nis now the biggest problem in most computer designs. One data point\nsuggests we could solve this problem, the human brain. We pack huge\nprocessing power into our skulls without overheating by using a variety\nof techniques, including folding the surface of the brain, running each\nneuron very slowly and maybe even using quantum mechanics. A very\nrecent discovery is that brains could be using quantum effects to transmit\nsignals. If true — and the research has only been recently published -\nit means we may use a form of high-temperature superconductivity to\navoid overheating. More on this in Chapter 4.\n\nExcluding exotic quantum effects, the main difference between\ncomputer and human brains is their processing architecture. Brains\nuse slow, asynchronous logic to process information rather than the\nfast, synchronous type used in modern day computers. Logic gates in\ntoday’s computers work all the time, even when there is nothing to do.\nFor example, if I multiply 2 by 3 on my laptop the entire multiply circuit,\ndesigned to work on 20 digit numbers will still operate, and, even worse,\nit will operate on every tick of the master clock even if there is nothing\nto multiply. The brain, by contrast, works only as it needs; unused gates\ndon't operate. This gives a massive reduction in unnecessary power\nconsumption. We'd like to use this technique in modern computers but\nitis very difficult to implement. Tiny changes in timing cause completely\ndifferent operation and this makes them hard to test. We accept this\nsort of problem in humans, calling it ‘human error’, but we count on\ncomputers to behave absolutely reliably, so full-blown asynchronous logic\nis not likely to appear anytime soon. Some of these ideas, however, have\nmade their way into today’s consumer devices. For example, the chips\nin the latest iPhone contain two CPUs: a small slow one operating when\nthe phone is dormant in your pocket, and a large fast one that switches\non when you need the power for a game or other high performance task.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015712",
