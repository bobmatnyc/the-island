  "text": "In choosing to return, now, to Camp David for two weeks of summit talks, I\nknew the risks. Of all the moments of truth in my life — and in the life of my\ncountry — few, if any, would carry higher stakes. Success would mean not just\none more stutter-step away from our century-long conflict with the Palestinians.\nIt would signal a real, final peace: in treaty-speak, end of conflict. Whatever the\ncomplexities of putting an agreement into practice, given all the suffering and\nbloodshed endured by both sides, we would have crossed a point of no return.\n\nThere would be two states, for two peoples.\n\nAnd if we failed? I knew, if only from months of increasingly stark\nintelligence reports, that an explosion of Palestinian violence — not just with\nstones or bottles this time, but with guns and explosives — would be only a\nmatter of time.\n\nI knew something else as well. This would be a moment of truth not just for\nme. Or for Bill Clinton, a man who understood our conflict more deeply, and\nwas more determined to help us end it, than any other president before him. It\nwas a moment of truth for the leader of the Palestinians, Yasir Arafat.\n\nThe Oslo Accords of 1993, groundbreaking though they were, had created a\npeace process, not peace. Over the past few years, that process had been\nlurching from crisis to crisis. Political support for negotiations was fraying. And\nyet the core issues of our conflict had not been resolved. In fact, they had hardly\nbeen talked about. The reason for this was no secret. For both sides, these\nquestions lay at the heart of everything we’d been saying for years, to the world\nand to ourselves, about the roots of the conflict and the minimum terms we\ncould accept in order to end it. At issue were rival claims on security, final\nborders, Israeli settlements, Palestinian refugees, and the future of ancient city\nof Jerusalem. None of these could be resolved without painful, and politically\nperilous, compromises.\n\nEntering the summit, despite the pressures ahead, I was confident that I, with\nmy team of aides and negotiators, would do our part to make such a final peace\nagreement possible. Nor did I doubt that President Clinton, whom I had come to\nview not just as a diplomatic partner but a friend, would rise to the occasion.\n\nBut as for Arafat? There was simply no way of knowing.\n\nThat was why I had pressed President Clinton so hard to convene the\nsummit. That was why, despite the misgivings of some of his closest advisers,\nhe had taken the plunge. We both knew that the so-called “final-status issues” —\n\n2\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011473",
