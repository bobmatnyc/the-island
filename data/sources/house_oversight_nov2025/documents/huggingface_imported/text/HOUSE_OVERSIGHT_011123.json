  "text": "CHAPTER 10: THREE PANTHEONS\n\nA few weeks ago | was being interviewed about my opera “Usher House”. How\nwould I like to be remembered? With a straight face, I said | would like to be thought\nthe best composer since Mahler, the best poet since Masefield, and the best\neconomist since John Stuart Mill. The interviewer looked startled. Was she talking\n\ninstead to the successor of Don Quixote, Emperor Norton and Walter Mitty?\n\nProbably. But not to worry. Fantasies are good things. They don’t become delusions\nuntil we start believing them. What I believe is that at least dozens of composers\nhave the knack. There must be hundreds, considering the terrific film scores\nattributed to names new to me when | hang on for the credits. Each of us, very much\nincluding film composers, gives the world what we think it needs. We like to be\nappreciated, but we don’t give a fig what it wants. We won't always agree on what it\nneeds. We'll defend to the death the other guy’s right to his message. But we prefer\nour own. That’s what my answer meant. We're each the best. But I do have the\n\ntemerity to limit the list to those few dozens or hundreds.\n\nSomeone might also be surprised at my choice of benchmarks in verse and\neconomics. Masefield and Mill? A consensus might have picked T. S. Elliot, say, and\nLord Keynes. Masefield and Mill are likelier to be remembered as old-fashioned\nfuddy-duddies already outmoded when they wrote. But that’s me. I am Don Quixote.\nNota single idol in my pantheons in those three fields was born after 1900, although\n\nthat could change in economics.\n\nMy pantheon in music is Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, Wagner and Mahler. Mahler,\nthe last-born, died in 1911 at 51. What about Mozart? Clearly colossal. Listen to the\nslow movements of almost any of his piano concertos. Childlike simplicity, then a\nslight surprise, then another, and all at once we are on a trip through the stars. But\nmy top five show us more. Mozart is too darned enigmatic. He is too darned coy. He\n\nis too darned third-personal. And | like breaking a sweat. Mozart is uniquely the\n\nChapter 10: Three Pantheons 2/10/16 1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011123",
