For example over the weekend BJP\nspokesmen have been saying that the party still intends to reverse an\nexisting policy that would allow foreign investors to open supermarkets in\nlarger cities, and even then only under limited circumstances.\n\nMr Modi would be wiser to downplay the influence of both sorts of\nnationalists. To sustain confidence that he can get the economy growing\nfaster will require pulling off some difficult feats, not least attracting more\nforeign capital into a host of industries which could include insurance,\nbanking, defence and many parts of infrastructure. He needs to send a\nclear message, as he picks ministers and begins to offer policy, that India\naspires to become strong on the back of economic growth, more\ninternational trade, deeper global engagement—and not by promoting\nnationalist tendencies at home. He has a decent record of reaching out to\nother countries, notably Japan, in his time as chief minister of Gujarat.\nSince his victory on May 16th he has fielded calls from Barack Obama,\nDavid Cameron and a host of other global well-wishers eager to engage\nIndia internationally. Mr Obama for example made clear that India’s\nprime minister would be welcome to visit the United States. The\nAmericans in particular want a decisive break from an earlier period, when\ninteraction with Mr Modi concerned his record in handling communal\nviolence in his state in 2002. Mr Modi in other words, by winning so\nemphatically on May 16th, appears both to have made history and escaped\nit. That is no mean feat at all.\n\nArticle 4.\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor\n\nAn India ready to dream big\n\nEditorial\n\nMay 18, 2014--Years before Narendra Modi won this month’s election\nthat now allows him to become India’s next leader, the former tea-stall\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031578",
