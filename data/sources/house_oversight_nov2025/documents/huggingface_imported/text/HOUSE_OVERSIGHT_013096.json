  "text": "180 10 A Mind-World Correspondence Principle\n\ntion graph. Given two world-paths P and Q, it’s obvious how to define the composition P*Q one\nfollows P and then, after that, follows Q, thus obtaining a longer path. Similarly for mind-paths.\n\nIn category theory terms, we are constructing the free category associated with the graph:\nthe objects of the category are the nodes, and the morphisms of the category are the paths.\nAnd category theory is the right way to be thinking here we want to be thinking about the\nrelationship between the world category and the mind category.\n\nThe world-mind transfer function can be interpreted as a mapping from paths to subgraphs:\nGiven a world-path, it produces a set of mind state-sets, which have a number of links between\nthem. One can then define a world-mind path transfer function M(P) via taking the mind-graph\nM(nodes(P)), and looking at the highest-weight path spanning M(nodes(P)). (Here nodes?\nobviously means the set of nodes of the path P.)\n\nA functor F between the world category and the mind category is a mapping that preserves\nobject identities and so that\n\nF(P *Q) = F(P) * F(Q)\n\nWe may also introduce the notion of an approximate functor, meaning a mapping F so that\nthe average of\n\nd(F(P * Q), F(P) * F(Q))\n\nis small.\n\nOne can introduce a prior distribution into the average here. This could be the Levin universal\ndistribution or some variant (the Levin distribution assigns higher probability to computation-\nally simpler entities). Or it could be something more purpose specific: for example, one can give\na higher weight to paths leading toward a certain set of nodes (e.g. goal nodes). Or one can\nuse a distribution that weights based on a combination of simplicity and directedness toward\na certain set of nodes. The latter seems most interesting, and I will define a goal-weighted ap-\nproximate functor as an approximate functor, defined with averaging relative to a distribution\nthat balances simplicity with directedness toward a certain set of goal nodes.\n\nThe move to approximate functors is simple conceptually, but mathematically it’s a fairly\nbig step, because it requires us to introduce a geometric structure on our categories. But there\nare plenty of natural metrics defined on paths in graphs (weighted or not), so there’s no real\nproblem here.\n\n10.4 The Mind-World Correspondence Principle\n\nNow we finally have the formalism set up to make a non-trivial statement about the relationship\nbetween minds and worlds. Namely, the hypothesis that:\n\nMIND-WORLD CORRESPONDENCE PRINCIPLE\nFor an organism with a reasonably high level of intelligence in a certain world, relative to\n\na certain set of goals, the mind-world path transfer function is a goal-weighted approximate\nfunctor.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013096",
