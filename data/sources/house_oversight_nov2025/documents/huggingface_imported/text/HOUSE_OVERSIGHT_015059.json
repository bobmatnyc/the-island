  "text": "pack of Trojans, and a tube of Crest toothpaste, please.” But four decades\nlater there were huge billboards, warning: “If you can’ t say no, use\ncondoms.” However, an executive of the Gannett Outdoor Advertising\nCompany confirmed that they held off putting up those signs until after a\nvisit by the Pope.\n\nMembers of the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy have been faced\nwith an interesting dilemma. On the one hand, they are opposed to\ncondoms as an artificial method of birth control. On the other hand, they\nare aware that condoms can serve as a protection against AIDS. But a\ngroup of bishops issued a statement that educational programs which\ninclude information about condoms should also stress that they are\nmorally incorrect.\n\nThat’ s sort of like in the Watergate scandal when Richard Nixon\nsaid, “We could get the million dollars—but that would be wrong.\"\n\nCoincidentally, in November 2010, while the porn industry in\nCalifornia was being pressured to require all male actors to wear condoms\nto prevent AIDS, in the Vatican it was revealed that, for the exact same\nreason, Pope Benedict--in his official capacity as the Church’ s chief spin\ndoctor--went on record proclaiming that under some circumstances it\n\nmight be acceptable for a (male) prostitute to use a condom.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015059",
