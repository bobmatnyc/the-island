  "text": "explorer. Knowing | was an unbeliever, he once asked me, “What do\natheists say during sex when they come?”\n\n“Oh, no-God!\" | responded, interspersing those words with moans\nand groans. “Oh, no-God! Oh, no-God! Oh, no-God!\" He suggested that\n| expand that concept into a stage piece, and it evolved into a ten-minute\nmeditation on the relationship between religion and orgasms.\n\nScott conducted theatrical workshops, and one of his students was\nJohn Densmore, the former drummer for The Doors. “I stumbled into the\ndowntown art scene,” Densmore told me, “after a big peak in\nrock’ n’ roll. It felt as creative as the’ 60s. | now get off on the process,\nand it doesn’ t matter if it’ s fifty people at the Wallenboyd or twenty\nthousand at Madison Square Garden, it’ s the work that rings my bell.”\n\nScott also produced Peter Bergman, of the Firesign Theatre. Scott\nthought that Peter, Paul and Harrywould be a great title for an evening of\npolitical satire at the Museum of Contemporary Art. He asked the curator if\nshe knew of an appropriate performer named Harry. She suggested Harry\nShearer. Scott asked me about him. “He’ s brilliant,” | said, “let’ s do\nit.\" And so he produced a completely sold-out series that was extended\n\nfor two weekends.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015311",
