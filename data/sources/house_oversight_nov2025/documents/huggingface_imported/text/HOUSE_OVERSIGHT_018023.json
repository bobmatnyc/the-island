When he heard that | was writing about his\nrelationship with billionaire Jeffrey Epstein and the related allegation that Dershowitz\nengaged in sex with a minor, he tracked me down to tell his side of the story.\n\nThe backdrop: Dershowitz was part of a legal team that had negotiated a plea deal in\n2008 in which Epstein pleaded guilty to felony charges in Florida for soliciting prostitution\n\nfrom a minor. Epstein served 13 months in prison but was spared federal charges under\n\nthe deal. Last December, lawyers Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassellfiled suit against\n\nthe U.S. government, arguing that the plea deal violated the rights of Epstein’s alleged\nsex victims; the suit also alleges that Dershowitz had sex with one of the victims when\nshe was under age. Dershowitz has denied all the allegations, and Edwards and Cassell\nhave filed a defamation suit against Dershowitz for calling them liars.\n\nThe following are excerpts from my two phone conversations with Dershowitz:\n\nFrom what I’ve read, your relationship with Epstein seemed chummy. You\nsocialized with him and you and your family stayed at his various homes. Isn’t ita\n\nbad idea for a lawyer to be so close to a notorious client?\n\nLet me tell you how | met him. | was introduced to him by Lady de Rothschild as an\nacademic colleague. He was friendly with Larry Summers. . . He was in the process of\n\ncontributing $50 million to Harvard for evolutionary biology.\n\nSo Epstein was friendly with all sorts of Harvard muckety-mucks.\n\nhttps:/Awww.law.com/alm|D/1202715316005/Prof-Dershowitz-Tell-Me-How-You-Really-Feel/?slreturn=201 90308174659 1/3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018023",
