He also said he had been a senior adviser at the Defense\nIntelligence Agency, even though, according to that intelligence\nservice, he was never employed there. (He did speak at an inter-\nagency counterintelligence course the DIA had sponsored.) He said\nhe had a $200,000-a-year salary from Booz Allen when, according\nto Booz Allen, it was $133,000. It is understandable that he wanted\nto impress these Guardian journalists in light of his young age and\nboyish appearance, even to the extent of meretriciously claiming\nin the video that he had been personally given the “authority” at\nthe NSA to intercept President Obama’s private communications,\nwhich, according to an NSA spokeswoman, was not true.

Before\nthe story could be published, however, the Guardian policy required\nrelevant American government officials be given the opportunity to\nrespond. Gibson made the requisite call to the White House national\nsecurity spokesperson, Caitlin Hayden, who arranged a conference\ncall with the FBI’s deputy director, Sean Joyce, the NSA’s deputy\ndirector, Chris Inglis, and Robert Litt, the legal officer for the Office of\nthe Director of National Intelligence.
