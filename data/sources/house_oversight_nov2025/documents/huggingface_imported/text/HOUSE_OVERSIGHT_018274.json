  "text": "4,\n\nToday the world is entering a new era of revolution. The fourth wave of fresh,\nturbulent dynamics to confront America since Jefferson gamely predicted those\ncenturies of virtuous prosperity back in that 1787 letter to Madison. Driven by\nincredible technological shifts and their economic, military and social implications,\nnew forces are beginning to tear into the established global order. Among the most\nfundamental puzzles now is the problem of an American national mission. What\ndoes America seek to achieve in the world? And how? On what basis will the United\nStates secure the chance to continue “peaceably”, as Jefferson would have it?\n\nBecause the country plays such a central role, these questions’ answers will affect\nthe calculations of every nation, of every new force yearning for influence. They\nrepresent the crucial background against which we will all live, build businesses,\ntravel and learn. You might feel, sitting in Silicon Valley or Iowa, that such shifts\ndon’t matter to you now, but the cold truth is that the international system is\nunlikely to be arranged, in two or three decades’ time, along the lines that bind it\nnow. Too many violent forces are at work. But must this be a disaster? The\ntechnological demands of our age are forcing a new sensibility everywhere.\nResearch labs, medicine, science, finance and the arts are all hunting now for anew\noutlook. The need for a fresh perspective is also reflected in the biggest of all\nhistorical questions, the one that will decide if we live in an era of peace or one of\nfear, uncertainty and tragedy: How is the international system to be ordered?\n\nThe idea that the stability of the world system might honestly be at stake right now\nfeels incredible to the generations of Americans born after World War II. A struggle\nfor global order? Real, sharp, bloody nation-imperiling violence? Though we know\nsuch traps are a recurring feature of human history, we have been mostly numbed\nand reassured by the passing of optimistic, fast and prosperous decades. We know\nmostly a blur of IPOs, of rising real estate prices, and confident growth out of every\ncrisis in our memory. Survival and stability have been, fortunately, the least of the\nnational concerns. The sly aside of Jules Jusserand, the French Ambassador to\nWashington for 20 years in the last century, about America’s position in the world\npretty much summed up our views: “On the north she had a weak neighbor; on the\nsouth, another weak neighbor; on the east, fish, and on the west, fish.”4? Most\nAmericans now alive grew up relying on the durable institutions and ideas and\nstructures built by the World War Two generation. We ride on their roads, fly into\ntheir airports, and use the schools and media they built. We absorbed their habits of\nconsumption, home ownership, optimism and energy. This inheritance produced an\nhistoric level of prosperity. It inspired other nations. And - along with those fathoms\nof fish and friendly neighbors - it assured a position of real world leadership. Since\nthe end of the World Wars, America has fought six expensive smaller wars and lost\n\n49 The sly aside: Jules Jusserand quoted in George C. Herring, From Colony to\nSuperpower: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776, (New York: Oxford University Press,\n2008), 6\n\n42\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018274",
