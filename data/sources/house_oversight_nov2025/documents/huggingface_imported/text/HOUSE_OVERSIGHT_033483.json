  "text": "To compare the United States’ performance and leadership to Mexico’s, Japan’s and China’s is particularly ill-timed.\nTrump might be stuck in a 1980s time warp on Japan. When his “The Art of the Deal” was published in 1987, Americans\nwere envious of Japan’s brilliant leaders, who were said to be outsmarting the United States at every turn. Since then,\nJapan has become the poster child for economic stagnation and political paralysis. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been\nunwilling or unable to get his promised reforms enacted, and the country’s economy continues to shrink.\n\nMexico is watching its growth collapse. While its president, Enrique Pefia Nieto, is a courageous and intelligent leader\nwho has made some very bold decisions, he has also made some significant missteps. Most important, the country was\nill-prepared for plunging oil prices that have battered government revenues and growth.\n\nChina has had three decades of supercharged growth and competent government policy. But in the past few years,\nBeijing went on a borrowing binge, running up its total debt to levels that are unprecedented, according to Sharma. And\nin the past two months it has made mistakes in managing both its equity markets and currency — mistakes that have\ncost $400 billion, the Financial Times reports.\n\nOf course, the United States has problems that are worrying, such as wage stagnation and low labor-force participation.\nBut the important comparison is not to some ideal fantasy of what America might be but to other countries in the real\nworld. And the facts show, Mr. Trump, we’re killing them .\n\nNOTE: This e-mail message is subject to the Dubai World Group disclaimer see http:/Awww.dubaiworld.ae/email_ disclaimer\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033483",
