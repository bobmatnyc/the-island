( maybe a filing that\nreopened things, )\n\nnone of this as a practical matter has any influence upon the ultimate action taken . I merely needed to\nknow a simple answer. and today after asking at least every week since then do not have an answer. I\nhave been trying not to add stress to your day. 1 try to explain things and take the time to do so gently, (\nnot my forte . this is one question out of hundreds. the fact that a 21 year old was in the office only\nxeroxing for a month, was obvious to everyone in the office. having a 26 year old xeroxing instead doesnt\nmove us forward, answers first. copying old files. can wait.\n\nDate: Wed, Apr 22, 2015 at 1:56 PM\n\nSubject: another flowery email.\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella (Ti -\n\nI am sorry. I realize you are under tremendous stress, In Bedford you asked me for my help I could not\nhave been more clear that thought it very unwise as in my words I did not want any financial arrangment\nbetween us, it risked conflict and tension what neither of us needed more of. and did not want to risk\ntorturing our friendship into the likes of the kind you have with Mark nor Josh, : now,- I dont have\nanyone but you yelling at me , in my own house. no one. it is highly unpleasant but I am trying my best to\nbe understanding . sorry. From the outset and as you told me you recall. 1 tsuggested that three years\nshould be the period of engagment. as planning is not a one year excericse . you declined to commit to a\nnumber of alternatives presented to you for payment of the third year. I told you in nov that you should\ndecide whether to now sign on for that very third year as the vast majority of my work ended on oct 15.\nyou recently told me you thought i was kidding. -you hired brad patting him on the back that after months\nof inquiry he can now, finallly tell you which llc owns the cars??\n\nonce he has all the facts what next ??._ whether or not you refer to a portion of the third year as after\ncare, or whatever term besides 'scoundrel you choose to use, I m not sure why you assume now it should\nbe free.( 1 HATE THIS CONVERSATION < HATE , ) andi heard you when you said you told me what\nwas | work still to be done you thought valuable enough to pay for. please tell me . and then we can\ndecide the next steps ,,, if any. I consider my work rarefied art. I guess the value is in the eye of the\nbeholder . IT reminds me of those people looking at a modern art piece and saying \" my child could do\nthat\". hope you are feeling better.\n\nDate: Fri, May 1, 2015 at 12:50 AM\n\nSubject:\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella = Cti—‘iCS\n\nada and brad are respondbile for the loan ,. docs, at a minimum, leon he hasn't read the financial\nstatements SINCE DEC. !!. impossible ,had he done so the silly numbers jump off the page .
