Absolutely.\nQ. Allright. Yeah. Let me just clarify one\n\npoint before you do that.\n\nA. Yes, sir.\n\nQ. In your answer, were you referring to the\nevidence you could recall or the information you could\nrecall that supported your allegations as to both\nVirginia Roberts and other minors, or were you treating\nthose separately?\n\nA. No, I was not treating those separately. I\nwas -- for me, there's a common -- what -- what the law\nrefers to as a common scheme or plan in a --\n\nQ. Okay.\n\nA. -- acriminal conspiracy for international\ntrafficking that involved not just a single girl, but\nmultiple girls.

So this refreshes my recollection. Sarah\nKellen, I think I referred to her as Miss Kellen.\nSarah Kellen was the first name.\n\nNadia Marcinkova, Nadia was the first name\nthere. Adrianna Mucinska was the full name of those --\nthat's the second echelon of the -- of the -~ of the\ncriminal conspiracy.\n\nOh, this refreshes my recollection that\nJeffrey Epstein had answered some questions in the civil\nlitigation.
