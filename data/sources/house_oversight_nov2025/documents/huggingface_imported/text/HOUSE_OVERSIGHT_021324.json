  "text": "between observing action and\nunderstanding emotion. This link has\nbeen most clearly demonstrated in the\ncase of facial expressions — if I observe\nthe muscles of the face in a position to\nconvey an emotional state, clearly I\nperceive the emotion. What has been\nshown recently is that observing such\nfacial expressions leads to two kinds of\nbrain activations in the observer: The\nfirst set of regions activated are those\nthat would be used by the observer to\nexecute the identical face movements,\njust as with hand or mouth movements.\nHowever, additional regions are also\nactive, and these are precisely the ones\nthat would be involved if the observer\nwere to feel the observed emotion\npersonally. Thus the circuitry for action\nobservation in the human brain is\ninterdependent with parts of the brain\ncritical for understanding more complex\nnuanced aspects of the world.\n\nMirror Neurons\n\nIt turns out that there may be\ncellular building blocks in the brain that\nare particularly important for observing\nand executing actions, and may\nultimately lead to an explanation of\naction understanding and imitation-\nbased learning. In fact, such structures\nwould contribute to any form of\nunderstanding that could be partly\nexplained by imagined re-enactment of\nperceived actions (e.g., seeing an\nemotional facial expression, hearing a\ncry of pain). The cells under discussion\nare a type of nerve cell, or neuron,\ndiscovered in the front part of the\nmonkey brain by Professor Giacomo\nRizzolatti and his colleagues at the\nUniversity of Parma. The scientists\ntrained monkeys to perform specific\nactions like grasping an object or licking\ntheir lips, and were performing electrical\nrecordings in regions in the front of the\n\nPage |78\n\nbrain known to coordinate movements.\nThese recording machines note brain\nactivity both visually, as a graph on a\nscreen, and auditorily, by a loud series of\nclicks, indicating the firing of a neuron.\nRizzolatti and his team were focusing on\na particular region in the front of the\nbrain, and were having the monkey\nperform all sorts of hand, mouth, and\neye movements to see how the brain\ncells were organized to make these\nmovements happen. One day (or so the\nstory goes), one of the researchers\nreturned from lunch while the electrical\nrecordings were being made, and was\nfinishing off a cone of superb Italian\ngelato, when all of a sudden the\nrecording device starting making a loud\nseries of clicks. The returning scientist\nstopped licking his ice cream cone to see\nwhat was going on, and the noise\nstopped. When he restarted licking his\ngelato, the clicks resumed, and when he\nstopped again, they stopped. The\ninvestigators had discovered a type of\nneuron that was sensitive to the monkey\nobserving a particular human action.\n\nIt was not surprising that\nfollowing training to perform an action,\nsome neurons in the motor region of the\nbrain responded while performing that\naction, when the same neurons would\nnot have responded beforehand.\nHowever, it was extremely surprising to\nfind that some of those neurons also\nresponded vigorously when the monkey\nobserved the very same learned actions.\nThrough a methodical and systematic\napproach, this group was able to make a\nmore elaborate and far-reaching set of\nobservations. For a small subset of\nneurons, if a monkey had learned to\nreach for a particular object, seeing\nanother monkey reach for the same\nobject would cause the neuron to fire.\nFor a different subset of neurons, if the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021324",
