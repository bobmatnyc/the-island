  "text": "11\n\nFaced with this dynamic, it will be difficult for Fatah to maintain its\nrelationship with Israel. Indeed, Fatah could be forced to initiate an\nintifada, something it would greatly prefer to avoid, as this would\nundermine what economic development the West Bank has\nexperienced.\n\nIsrael therefore conceivably could face conflict in Gaza, a conflict\nalong the Lebanese border and a rising in the West Bank, something\nit clearly knows. In a rare move, Israel announced plans to call up\nreserves in September. Though preannouncements of such things are\nnot common, Israel wants to signal resolution.\n\nIsrael has two strategies in the face of the potential storm. One is a\ndevastating attack on Gaza followed by rotating forces to the north to\ndeal with Hezbollah and intense suppression of an intifada. Dealing\nwith Gaza fast and hard is the key if the intention is to abort the\nevolution I laid out. But the problem here is that the three-front\nscenario I laid out is simply a possibility; there is no certainty here. If\nIsrael initiates conflict in Gaza and fails, it risks making a possibility\ninto a certainty - and Israel has not had many stunning victories for\nseveral decades. It could also create a crisis for Egypt's military\nrulers, not something the Israelis want.\n\nIsrael also simply could absorb the attacks from Hamas to make Israel\nappear the victim. But seeking sympathy is not likely to work given\nhow Palestinians have managed to shape global opinion. Moreover,\nwe would expect Hamas to repeat its attacks to the point that Israel\nno longer could decline combat.\n\nWar thus benefits Hamas (even if Hamas maintains plausible\ndeniability by having others commit the attacks), a war Hezbollah has\ngood reason to enter at such a stage and that Fatah does not want but\ncould be forced into. Such a war could shift the Egyptian dynamic\nsignificantly to Hamas' advantage, while Iran would certainly want al-\nAssad to be able to say to Syrians that a war with Israel is no time for\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031923",
