  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nScalia’s anachronistic views are appointed to the court.”\n\nThis is not to suggest that plainly innocent people are being routinely executed in the United\nStates. There are other checks and balances, such as gubernatorial commutation. (Though in\nsome states they are rarely, if ever, granted.) Moreover, the courts, even the Supreme Court,\nsometimes find other ways to free the obviously innocent in most cases.\n\nThe real problem is how to prove one’s innocence when the courts deny possibly innocent\ndefendants the tools necessary to prove the certainty of their innocence. The Jeffrey MacDonald\ncase discussed previously, is a prime example of this problem.” The courts have repeatedly shut\nthe door on his serious claims that he can establish his innocence if he were to be given an\nopportunity to subpoena evidence and witnesses. In his case several crucial witnesses have died.\nThese include Helena Stoeckley and her boyfriend, who may have been the actual killers, and Jim\nBritt, the Deputy Marshall who would have testified that the prosecutor improperly pressured\nStoeckley to “forget” what she had seen—that is, to lie about her memory.\n\n™ Tn 2009, I challenged Justice Scalia, who has written that he would have to leave the Supreme Court if his\n\nconstitutional views conflicted with his obligation to the Catholic Church, to debate this issue:\n\nI hereby challenge Justice Scalia to a debate on whether Catholic doctrine permits the execution of a\nfactually innocent person who has been tried, without constitutional flaw, but whose innocence is clearly\nestablished by new and indisputable evidence. Justice Scalia is always willing to debate issues involving\nreligious teachings. He has done so, for example, with the great Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, and with others as\nwell. He also has debated me at the Harvard Law School. Although I am neither a rabbi nor a priest, I am\nconfident that I am right and he is wrong under Catholic Doctrine. Perhaps it takes chutzpah to challenge\na practicing Catholic on the teachings of his own faith, but that is a quality we share.\n\nI invite him to participate in the debate at Harvard Law School, at Georgetown Law School, or anywhere\nelse of his choosing. The stakes are high, because if he loses—if it is clear that his constitutional views\npermitting the execution of factually innocent defendants are inconsistent with the teachings of the\nCatholic Church—then, pursuant to his own published writings, he would have no choice but to conform\nhis constitutional views to the teachings of the Catholic Church or to resign from the Supreme Court.\n\nScalia did not take up my challenge.\n® This is what the Court of Appeals had said in the Jeffrey MacDonald case:\n\n[W]e acknowledge that MacDonald has a daunting burden ahead in seeking to establish that he is eligible\nfor habeas corpus relief solely because of his \"actual innocence.\" The Supreme Court has only \"assume[d],\nfor the sake of argument . . ., that in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of ‘actual innocence'\nmade after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional.\" Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S.\n390, 417, 113 S. Ct. 853, 122 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1993). The Court has yet to come across any prisoner who\ncould make the \"extraordinarily high\" threshold showing for such an assumed right. /d.; see Dist.\nAttorney's Office v. Osborne, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 2321, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (2009) (\"Whether [a federal\nconstitutional right to be released upon proof of ‘actual innocence'] exists is an open question. We have\nstruggled with it over the years, in some cases assuming, arguendo, that it exists while also noting the\ndifficult questions such a right would pose and the high standard any claimant would have to meet.\").\n\n228\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017315",
