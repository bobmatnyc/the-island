Have you ever met a young girl, under the age of 18, in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein or on one of Jeffrey Epstein’s\nproperties?\n\n2. How many times have you visited Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in West Palm Beach, Florida?\n\n3. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida reached a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey\nEpstein, in which he agreed to make civil restitution for sexual abuse committed against 40 girls at the mansion. Do you\nhave any reason to doubt that that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused 40 underaged girls.\n\n4. Didn't Jeffrey Epstein tell you that he repeatedly had sex with these underage girls?\n\n4. Jeffrey Epstein is a now a registered sex offender. Do you have any reason to doubt that this registration is\nappropriate?\n\n5. Have you ever met Ghislaine Maxwell in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein or at one of his properties?\n\n6. Did you send correspondence to the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.

According to testimony in court cases, when Jeffrey Epstein was at his mansion in West Palm Beach, Florida, he would\nreceive almost daily “massages” that were in fact sexual encounters with these underage girls. Do you have any reason\nto doubt this testimony?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015588",
