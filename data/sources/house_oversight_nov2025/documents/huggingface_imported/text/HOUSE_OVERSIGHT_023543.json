We shall defend our people with all\nthe means at our disposal.”\n\nOne sometimes hears the argument that if Iran can live with an Israeli\nbomb, why can’t Israel live with an Iranian bomb? The answer is that\nno Israeli leader has ever threatened to eradicate Iran.\n\nIran is a large country, but Israel is a tiny one, smaller than New\nJersey. At its narrowest point, it is only nine miles wide. Israel’s\nnuclear arsenal can deter its enemies only if they have the wisdom\nand the sanity to be deterred. During the Cold War, the Russians and\nthe Americans operated under a political and military doctrine known\nas MAD, for mutual assured destruction. The doctrine assumed that\nno matter how bad things got between the Soviet Union and the\nUnited States—the 1962 Cuban missile crisis being a case in point—\nneither side would risk annihilation. The leaders of Iran do not think\nthat way. They reason as follows: “We have 70 million people, and\nIsrael has 7 million. If we attack the Zionists with nuclear bombs,\nthey will respond in kind. If they are lucky, they will kill half of us,\nbut if Allah wills it, we shall kill all of them, and there will still be 35\nmillion of us left.”\n\nWe humans may enjoy periods of peace—sometimes for a long time—\nbut we shall never entirely rid ourselves of war because we are\n“wired” to fight over pieces of land. Konrad Lorenz, Robert Ardrey,\nand Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus (the man who coined the Latin\nphrase Si vis pacem para bellum) are correct. So, too, is Max Boot,\nthe American author and military historian. He rejects the “sunny, if\nahistorical, Enlightenment faith that peace is the natural order of\nthings and war a temporary aberration.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023543",
