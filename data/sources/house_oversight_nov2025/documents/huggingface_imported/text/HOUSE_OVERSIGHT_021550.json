A week ago, the\n‘55-year-old investment banker be-\ngan serving 18 months in jail.\n\nBut that plea deal — guilty of\nfelony solicitation of prostitution\nand procuring a person under the\nage of 18 for prostitution — does\nnot account for all five of the girls,\none as young as 14, who alleged that\n\n‘Epstein sexually abused them. And\nwhy is Epstein serving his\nterm in the overcrowded\n\nPalm Beach County Jail | 38°“:\n\nand not a state prison,\nwhere inmates are sent if\ntheir sentences are longer\nthan one year?\n\nThe slow, dissatisfy-\ning resolution of the case\nsends a message to the\npublic that there’s a dif\nferent system of justice for\nthe wealthy who hire high-powered\nlawyers. Epstein’s legal team includ-\ned West Palm Beach defense attor-\nney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law\nSchool Professor Alan Dershowitz,\nwho defended O.J. Simpson against\nmurder charges, and Kenneth\nStarr, the prosecutor who pursued\nthen-President Bill Clinton for lying\nabout sex with young women.\n\nPalm Beach police spent 11\nmonths investigating Epstein be-\nfore State Attorney Barry Krischer\nsent the case to a grand jury, in-\nstead of charging Epstein so the\nman who once boasted of accepting\nonly billionaire clients could face a\ntrial. The police had taken a high\nschool transcript, class schedules\nand phone messages from Epstein’s\n\nWhy ts Jeffrey Epstein in\njail, and not prison?\n\nhome that showed he knew the girls\nwere underage. Yet Mr. Krischer\nwas more swayed by Epstein’s law-\nyers, who attempted to impugn the\ngirls’ character by showing they\nhad chatted on myspace.com about\nsmoking marijuana and drinking.\nHe should have let a jury decide\nwhether the victims — and Epstein\n— were credible.\n\nUltimately, one charge against\n\nthe age of one victim, and\nthe plea agreement left\nEpstein labeled a sex of\nfender. With that additional\ncharge, if Epstein had been\n\ncould have been sentenced\nto anything from probation\nto 15 years in prison, Assis-\ntant State Attorney Lanna\nBelohlavek said, adding that the\nrecommended guideline sentence\nwas 21 months.\n\nEpstein also won’t have to cer\ntify to the court that he is receiv-\ning counseling, typically required\nof sex offenders, because he has\na private psychiatrist. But without\ncourt supervision, who will ensure\nEpstein is in fact being treated?\n\nThe plea deal also drops a federal\ninvestigation of Epstein.
