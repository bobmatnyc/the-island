  "text": "We rolled into action. A crisis management team was set up, the Board of Regents promptly informed\n(first through the leadership), and an initial recommendation made. Specifically, | commissioned\nBaylor’s Faculty Athletic Representative (a post required under NCAA procedures) to conduct an internal\ninquiry into the charges. By design, the “FAR” operates outside of and independent of the Athletic\nDepartment. Serving in a watchdog capacity, a form of “check and balance,” the FAR reports directly to\nthe president. Respected law professor Jeremy Counsellor took on the role, and within several days,\nreported back — in a one-page summary that contained only the background of his appointment and his\nsolitary recommendation — that an outside investigation should be conducted. That is, no one inside or\nconnected to the university should be retained to provide a truly independent, honest assessment of the\nsituation.\n\nSo it was that Pepper Hamilton, a respected Philadelphia law firm, was retained. Their work began in\nearly September 2015, and came to conclusion in May 2016. To assure the independence of its work,\nthe Pepper Hamilton lawyers reported directly to a special three-person committee of Baylor’s Board of\nRegents. That structure remained in place throughout the lengthy process, culminating in a verbal\nreport — with numerous power point slides — to the Board of Regents in mid-May 2016. The final work\nproduct was two-fold: a set of findings of fact, reported by the Board of Regents, and a lengthy set of\nrecommendations from the law firm. There was no “report” in the traditional sense. The Board’s\nfindings and Pepper Hamilton’s recommendations were publicly released, leading to events that |\ndescribe in the next chapter.\n\nThe findings were deeply troubling. Moral outrage was the order of the day, throughout the country.\nThis was page one, above-the-fold news. Searing criticism unfolded, not simply of the football program\nbut overall the University’s stewardship with respect to interpersonal violence (including sexual assault)\nwas found wanting. The criticisms were directed atincluded what | call “first responders,” including\ncampus law enforcement, health services and counseling. Pepper Hamilton’s findings were summarized\nas a “fundamental failure” on the part of the University. This quickly became the prevailing narrative.\nThe narrative was reinforced by additional victims coming forward — some of whom had graduated —\nabout their tragic experiences. These were chronicled in dramatic ways by ESPN’s go-for-the-jugular\nprogram, “Outside the Lines.” Baylor — not just the football program — became a pariah.\n\nVictims’ stories moved the thoughtful observer or listener to a powerful combination of empathy and\noutrage. One’s heart goes out to the victim; a second later, waves of outrage wash over the empathetic\nobserver. How could this have happened? Who fell asleep at the switch? Who failed to protect these\nyoung women, and why? Did coaches turn a blind eye to reports of unconscionable acts by superstar\nplayers — or even non-superstars who abused (or worse) young women?. Did “first responders” on the\nUniversity’s payroll turn a deaf ear to distraught complaints of sexual violence, including rape? How\ncould this be, especially at a self-professed Christian university?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031535",
