Spontaneous changes in the apparent syllabic sound made by\nregularly presented, word-like auditory stimuli emerge irregularly, the duration of\nperceived sameness demonstrating a power law distribution of “dwell” times (Tuller\net al, 1998). The same kind of power law distribution of characteristic “brain times”\ncan be found in studies of gait cycle durations in normal walking (Hausdorff et al,\n1996) with a decrease in this locally detrended, a-like index compared with controls\n(0.91+0.05) in patients with the basal ganglia disorders of Parkinson’s (0.82+0.06)\nand Huntington’s (0.60+0.04) Diseases (Hausdorff et al, 1998). Hurst > 0.5 has\nbeen speculated to more accurately quantitate the fundamental time structure of\ncells that was previously called circahoralian (ultradian) intracellular rhythms\n(Brodski, 1998).\n\nReconstructions of Time Series as Orbital Geometries\n\nRene Thom (1972), extending the ideas of Poincaré and D’Arcy Thompson\n(1942), argued that experimentally useful, intuitive connections between the\nqualities of biological processes and the quantities of an explicit (equations known)\nor implicit (equations unknown) dynamical system could be best achieved through\nthe use of graphic representations of their geometric and topological forms. Notably\nsuccessful examples can be found in the work of Thom, Arnold (1984) and Zeeman\n(1977), who were inspired by “caustics” (the shapes made on surfaces by the\ncoincidence of reflected or refracted light rays) and Whitney’s representation of\nparametric manifolds (surfaces) by the shadows they would make on a plane when\nback lit (Whitney, 1955). This led to a small number of qualitatively predictive,\n\nno tt\n\nnumber-of-independent-parameters dependent shapes, such as “folds” “cusps” and\n“wavefronts.” Experimentally crossing the values of these independent variable\nforms at their singular boundaries successfully predicted discontinuities in the\notherwise smooth alterations in the dependent variable; i.e. bifurcations\n(“catastrophes”) in the behavior of the observable. This approach was best suited to\nthe study of systems with many independent variables and one dependent variable\n\nthat could be mapped on the axis of the latter to represent a continuum of\n\n215\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013715",
