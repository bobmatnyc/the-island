  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54019\n\nThe proposed Appendix to Subpart A\nincluded Board contact information and\nbasic enforcement procedures to enable\nemployees to learn more about their\nNLRA rights and how to enforce them.\nThus, the required notice confirmed that\nunlawful conduct will not be permitted,\nprovided information about the Board\nand about filing a charge with the\nBoard, and stated that the Board will\nprosecute violators of the NLRA. The\nnotice also indicated that there is a 6-\nmonth statute of limitations for filing\ncharges with the Board alleging\nviolations and provided Board contact\ninformation. The Board invited\nsuggested additions or deletions to these\nprovisions that would improve the\ncontent of the notice of employee rights.\nId.\n\nThe content of the proposed notice\nreceived more comments than any other\nsingle topic in the proposed rule. But of\nthe thousands of comments that address\nthe content of the notice, the majority\nare either very general, or identical or\nnearly identical form letters or\n“postcard” comments sent in response\nto comment initiatives by various\ninterest groups, including those\nrepresenting employers, unions, and\nemployee rights organizations. Many\ncomments from both individuals and\norganizations offer general support for\nthe content of the proposed notice,\nstating that employee awareness of basic\nlegal rights will promote a fair and just\nworkplace, improve employee morale,\nand foster workforce stability, among\nother benefits.97 More specifically, one\ncomment asserts that the proposed\nnotice ‘‘contains an accurate,\nunderstandable and balanced\npresentation of rights.” 98 The United\nTransportation Union contends that the\n“notice presents an understandable,\nconcise and extremely informative\nrecitation of workers’ rights, without\ngetting bogged down in extraneous\nlanguage, incomprehensible legalese or\ninnumerable caveats and exceptions.”\n\nOther comments were less supportive\nof the content of the proposed notice\nand the notice-posting requirement in\ngeneral. A significant number of\ncomments, including those from many\nindividuals, employers, and employer\nindustry and interest groups, argue that\nthe content of the notice is not balanced,\nand appears to promote unionization\ninstead of employee freedom of\nassociation. In particular, many\ncomments state that Section 7 of the\n\n°7 See comments of the National Immigration Law\nCenter, Service Employees International Union, and\nWeinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld.\n\n°8 Comment of David Fusco, a labor and\nemployment attorney.\n\nNLRA includes the right to refrain from\nunion activity, but claim that this right\nis given little attention in comparison to\nother rights in the proposed notice.\nSeveral comments also argue that the\nproposed notice excludes rights\nassociated with an anti-union position,\nincluding the right to seek\ndecertification of a bargaining\nrepresentative, the right to abstain from\nunion membership in “‘right-to-work”’\nstates, and rights associated with the\nSupreme Court’s decision in\nCommunications Workers v. Beck.°°\nComments also suggest that the notice\nshould include a warning to employees\nthat unionizing will result in a loss of\nthe right to negotiate directly with their\nemployer.1°° Many of these comments\nargue that a neutral government position\non unionization would be more\ninclusive of anti-union rights.1°\n\nA number of comments address the\nissue of complexity, and argue that the\nBoard’s attempt to summarize the law is\nflawed because the Board’s decisional\nlaw is too complex to condense into a\nsingle workplace notice.1°2 Some of the\ncomments addressing this issue note\nthat NLRA law has been developed over\n75 years, and involves interpretations by\nboth the NLRB and the Federal courts,\nsometimes with conflicting results. The\nChamber of Commerce cites the\n““NLRB’s Basic Guide to the National\nLabor Relations Act: General Principles\nof Law Under the Statute and\nProcedures of the National Labor\nRelations Board” (Basic Guide to the\nNLRA) (1997), available at http://\nwww.nirb.gov/publications/brochures,\nto make their point about legal\ncomplexity. In the Foreword to the\nBasic Guide to the NLRA, the Board’s\nGeneral Counsel states that ‘‘[alny effort\nto state basic principles of law ina\nsimple way is a challenging and\nunenviable task. This is especially true\nabout labor law, a relatively complex\nfield of law.”’ The thrust of these\ncomments about legal complexity was\nthat the NLRA is complex, dynamic,\nand nuanced, and any attempt to\nsummarize it in a workplace notice will\nresult in an oversimplification of the\nlaw and lead to confusion,\nmisunderstanding, inconsistencies, and\nsome say, heightened labor-management\nantagonism. Moreover, some comments\nexpress concern that Board member\nturnover could result in changes to the\n\n99 See comments of Pilchak, Cohen & Tice,\nAmerican Trucking Association, and Electrical and\nMechanical Systems Inc.\n\n100 See, e.g. comment of the Heritage Foundation.\n\n101 See, e.g., comment of the National Right to\nWork Committee.\n\n102 See, e.g., comment of COLLE, Retail Industry\nLeaders Association.\n\nlaw, which may require frequent\nupdates to the notice.1%\n\nMany comments suggest that the\nrequired notice should include only the\nspecific rights contained in Section 7 of\nthe NLRA or, at most, the rights and\nobligations stated in employee\naclvisories on the NLRB’s Web site. The\ncomments favoring a more general\nnotice suggest that the detailed list of\nrights far exceeds the “‘short and plain”\ndescription of rights that the Board has\nfound sufficient to “clearly and\neffectively inform employees of their\nrights under the Act’’ in unfair labor\npractice cases.1°4 See Ishikawa Gasket\nAmerica, Inc., 337 NLRB 175 (2001),\nenfd. 354 F.3d 534 (6th Cir. 2004). A\ncomment from Fisher & Phillips LLP\nargues that, under the Board’s current\nremedial practices, only an employer\nthat egregiously violates the Act on\nnumerous occasions is required to post\nsuch an inclusive list of rights.\n\nFinally, a number of comments\nsuggest that the notice should include a\nlist of employer rights, namely the right\nto distribute anti-union literature and\nthe right to discuss the company’s\nposition regarding unions.\n\nIn addition to the general comments\nabout the proposed notice, many\ncomments offer suggestions for specific\nrevisions to individual provisions\nwithin the five sections of the proposed\nnotice: the introduction, the statement\nof affirmative rights, the examples of\nunlawful conduct, the collective-\nbargaining provision, and the coverage\ninformation. The following discussion\npresents the comments related to\nindividual provisions of the notice,\nfollowed by the Board’s decisions\nregarding the content of the final notice\nmade in response to those comments.\n\na. Comments Regarding the Introduction\n\nThe introduction to the notice of\nrights in the proposed rule stated:\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)\nguarantees the right of employees to organize\nand bargain collectively with their\nemployers, and to engage in other protected\nconcerted activity. Employees covered by the\nNLRB are protected from certain types of\nemployer and union misconduct. This Notice\ngives you general information about your\nrights, and about the obligations of employers\nunder the NLRA. Contact the National Labor\nRelations Board (NLRB), the Federal agency\nthat investigates and resolves complaints\nunder the NLRA, using the contact\ninformation supplied below, if you have any\nquestions about specific rights that may\napply in your particular workplace.\n\n103 See comment of Capital Associated Industries,\nInc. and National Association of Manufacturers.\n\n104 See e.g. comments of COLLE and Coalition for\na Democratic Workplace.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022290",
