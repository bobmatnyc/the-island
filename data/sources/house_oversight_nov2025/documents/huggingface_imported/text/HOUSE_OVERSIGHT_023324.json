  "text": "you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for\nme and that brad needs to pays him .\n\n. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people ete. :\nI have taken heat for years over the fact that 1 gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up\nquestions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. (that was Eileen _) but\nsomehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . | when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you\nbellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect\nyou from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out\nthat he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really\ndangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes , was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no\nresponsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!! , your response was that was my opinion\nwas only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he\ntoo is still there, and a waste of money and space.\n\nMy time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign\nfunds repatriation plan that 1 had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re\nmy time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and\nmake any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess.\n\nThat being said, the tasks at hand are the following.\n\nYou have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully\nunwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would\nbe much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??!. Iam\nconcermed re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn\nACCURATE .. org charts. books , balance sheets . trust valuations. are alla part. Barry will need 2 months\nto just get his arm around what is there , this is before any needed modifications.,\n\na way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts , filing\nrequirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into\nnew plan. . \"XXXXX\" planning. art partnership engagement .. , airplane re-do. , buying another. .? boat\nsale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years overdue. . an accounting system. fire john\n.. Joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and . except for heather everyone should be replaced with\nnew. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize. cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock\nsales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you\nCANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. .CANNOT!!! _ this will be very detailed work. . a self\ninflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit . or contain it. . . you will need\n3 new hires .as there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you\nknow. He will need to be trained. note\n; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin, : im glad\nthat you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense , in fact I take comfort in the fact that after\nonly one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more.\n\nI expect as a friend you will understand that\n\nI will no longer , not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long\noverdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul\nweiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin, , no one. needs toend.. you and I had\npreviously agreed no more of that , and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can\nnot say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you\nwont want to pay , so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge\n\nIf I can find the time to work , on your project , which is not by any means certain as Ihave said, I hope\nyou understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as\nto avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with\nyou , I find it very distasteful. . soto be clear , my terms are as follows. I will only work for the usual 40\nmillion per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement . 5 million every 2 months\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023324",
