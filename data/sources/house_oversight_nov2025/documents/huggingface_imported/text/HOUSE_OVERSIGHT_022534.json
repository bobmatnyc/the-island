  "text": "The FCPA:\n\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\n\nyears after the acquisition. After another employee of Company A reports the long-running bribe scheme to a director at\nForeign Government Agency, Company A stops the payments and DOJ and SEC investigate.\n\nBased on these facts, would DOJ or SEC charge Company A?\n\nYes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company A in similar circumstances. Any charges would not,\nhowever, be premised upon successor liability, but rather on Company A's post-acquisition bribe payments, which\nthemselves created criminal and civil liability for Company A.\n\nScenario 3:\n\nUnder local law, Company A's ability to conduct pre-acquisition due diligence on Foreign Company is limited. In the\ndue diligence it does conduct, Company A determines that Foreign Company is doing business in high-risk countries\nand in high-risk industries but finds no red flags specific to Foreign Company's operations. Post-acquisition, Company\nA conducts extensive due diligence and determines that Foreign Company had paid bribes to officials with Foreign\nGovernment Agency. Company A takes prompt action to remediate the problem, including following the measures set\nforth in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02. Among other actions, it voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and\nSEC, ensures all bribes are immediately stopped, takes remedial action against all parties involved in the corruption, and\nquickly incorporates Foreign Company into a robust compliance program and Company A's other internal controls.\n\nBased on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A?\n\nDOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances. Companies can follow\nthe measures set forth in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02, or seek their own opinions, where adequate pre-acquisition\ndue diligence is not possible.\n\nHypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Already Subject to\nthe FCPA\n\nBoth Company A and Company B are Delaware corporations with their principal offices in the United States. Both\ncompanies’ shares are listed on a national U.S. exchange.\n\nScenario 1:\n\nCompany Ais considering acquiring several of Company B’s business lines. Prior to the acquisition, Company A engages\nin extensive due diligence, including: (1) having its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Company B’s\nsales and financial data, its customer contracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based\nanalysis of Company B’s customer base; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Company B; and\n(4) engaging in discussions with Company B’s general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding\nall corruption risks, compliance efforts, and any other major corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Company B\nover the past ten years. This due diligence aims to determine whether Company B has appropriate anti-corruption and\ncompliance policies in place, whether Company B’s employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies,\nhow Company B ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated.\n\nDuring the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Company B has made several potentially improper\npayments in connection with a government contract with Foreign Country. As a condition of the acquisition, Company A\nrequires Company B to disclose the misconduct to the government. Company A makes certain that the illegal payments\n\n(cont’d)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022534",
