Especially last night Mr.\nBeckler, as most Friday nights, no?\n\nYes, they are the new iterations of Ghislaine Maxwell; for you Richard Beckler, this originated from\nmy being a former Stone Ridge classmate of his elder daughter Katie Beckler, and because he was\non the Board of Stone Ridge during this period in time when my every family, friend, acquaintance\nand association was being contacted, bribed in one form or another, and turned against me (see\nbelow); as for Ken Adams, it stemmed from my having contacted him for representation in my 2011-\nfiled case against IBM also during this period of time when my every communication were being\ntracked.\n\nYou both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom,\nGhislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.)\n\n*\n\nWe start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s)\n\n1. \"Toward a New World Order\" speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015002",
