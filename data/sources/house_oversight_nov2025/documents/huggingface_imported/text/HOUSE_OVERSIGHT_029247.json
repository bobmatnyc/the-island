  "text": "Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker’s Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal\nsponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an\nelusive friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or\nprovided overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you\nhighlighted our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors;\nwhether you flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or\nasked your children’s school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation\nto take an interest in the project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of\nfinance, or of distribution; whether you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you\nenabled what we have done.\n\nHere’s what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak\npeeks of works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects.\n\ne The first eight-episode season of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-\nproduction between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new\nproduction company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring\nBill Clinton, Herbie Hancock and Sonia Sanchez _on Langston Hughes, Frank Gehry on Carl\nSandburg, Katie Couric on Elizabeth Bishop, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for\nnationwide launch in 2017.\n\n¢« Poetry in America’s many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their\nstudents are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of\nthe City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion\nmaterials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is\ndesigned to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and\ninternationally.\n\ne« Weare eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for\nMiddle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language\nArts instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural\nworld, conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in\nthe field with great teachers.\n\ne Arecent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network\nof charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready\neducational material on The Poetry of Art, Sport, and Play. This collection will include\ndiscussions on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature\ndancers, athletes, fashion designers, and more.\n\ne With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems,\nwe are eager to expand our reach and move into America’s schools, disseminating,\ntesting, and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to\nbegin work evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and,\neventually, to produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with\nintellectual growth.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029247",
