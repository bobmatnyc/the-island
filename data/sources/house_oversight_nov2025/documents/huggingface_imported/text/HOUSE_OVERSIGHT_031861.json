While indigenous\nforces exist in the borderland east of the Jordan, they lack the\nnumbers to be able to penetrate decisively west of the Jordan. Indeed,\nthe normal model is that, so long as Israel controls Judea and Samaria\n(the modern-day West Bank), then the East Bank of the Jordan River\nis under the political and sometimes military domination of Israel —\nsometimes directly through settlement, sometimes indirectly through\npolitical influence, or economic or security leverage.\n\nIsrael's vulnerability is in the north. There is no natural buffer\nbetween Phoenicia and its successor entities (today's Lebanon) to the\ndirect north. The best defense line for Israel in the north is the Litani\nRiver, but this is not an insurmountable boundary under any\ncircumstance. However, the area along the coast north of Israel does\nnot present a serious threat. The coastal area prospers through trade\nin the Mediterranean basin. It is oriented toward the sea and to the\ntrade routes to the east, not to the south. If it does anything, this area\nprotects those trade routes and has no appetite for a conflict that\nmight disrupt trade. It stays out of Israel's way, for the most part.\nMoreover, as a commercial area, this region is generally wealthy, a\nfactor that increases predators around it and social conflict within. It\nis an area prone to instability. Israel frequently tries to extend its\ninfluence northward for commercial reasons, as one of the predators,\nand this can entangle Israel in its regional politics. But barring this\nself-induced problem, the threat to Israel from the north is minimal,\ndespite the absence of natural boundaries and the large population.\nOn occasion, there is spillover of conflicts from the north, but not to\na degree that might threaten regime survival in Israel.\n\nThe neighbor that is always a threat lies to the northeast. Syria — or,\nmore precisely, the area governed by Damascus at any time — 1s\npopulous and frequently has no direct outlet to the sea. It is,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031861",
