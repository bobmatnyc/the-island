  "text": "Trump once tried to patent “You’ re fired.” Professional hater\nBannon resigned. Back to running his Breitbart News. He had taken over\nthe original right-wing website, Breitbart.com, after the death of editor\nAndrew Breitbart, who ironically was adopted and raised as a proud Jew.\n\nOrson Bean is my oldest living friend. He became a Christian\nlibertarian conservative, and we’ve had an ongoing email dialogue about\nreligion, but he’s still a Christian and I’m still an atheist. Not a militant\natheist, as I used to be, though. I changed when I realized that Martin Luther\nKing was a Christian, yet I was inspired by his actions, and George Lincoln\nRockwell, head of the American Nazi Party, was an agnostic, yet I abhorred\nwhat he stood for. It no longer mattered to me what anybody’s religious belief\nwas, only how they treated others. Either kind or cruel. That simple.\n\nI decided to email Orson: “If you can arrange for me to interview\nAndrew Breitbart’--his son-in-law--“Ill believe in God.” Orson must’ve\nforwarded my email to Breitbart, because He sent me an email saying,\n“Apparently there is a God,” with his own phone number. I called, we spoke,\nand he agreed to do an interview. My only ground rule would be that neither\nof us would interrupt the other. I contacted Steve Randall, my editor at\nPlayboy, and I got the assignment. I immediately sent an email to Orson with\n\nthe good news. The Subject line was “Praise the fucking Lord.”” Amen.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015459",
