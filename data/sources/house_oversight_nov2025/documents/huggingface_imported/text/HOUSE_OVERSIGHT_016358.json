  "text": "Social sampling, very simply, is looking around you at the actions of people who\nare like you, finding what’s popular, and then copying it if it seems like a good idea to\nyou. Idea propagation has this popularity function driving it, but individual adoption also\nis about figuring out how the idea works for the individual—a reflective attitude. When\nyou combine social sampling and personal judgment, you get superior decision making.\nThat’s amazing, because now we have a mathematical recipe for doing with humans what\nall those AI techniques are doing with dumb computer neurons. We have a way of\nputting people together to make better decisions, given more and more experience.\n\nSo, what happens in the real world? Why don’t we do this all the time? Well,\npeople are good at it, but there are ways it can run amok. One of these is through\nadvertising, propaganda, or “fake news.” There are many ways to get people to think\nsomething is popular when it’s not, and this destroys the usefulness of social sampling.\nThe way you can make groups of people smarter, the way you can make human ATI, will\nwork only if you can get feedback to them that’s truthful. It must be grounded on\nwhether each person’s actions worked for them or not.\n\nThat’s the key to AI mechanisms, too. What they do is analyze whether they\nperformed correctly. If so, plus one; if not, minus one. We need that truthful feedback to\nmake this human mechanism work well, and we need good ways of knowing about what\nother people are doing so that we can correctly assess popularity and the likelihood of\nthis being a good choice.\n\nThe next step is to build this credit-assignment function, this feedback function,\nfor people, so that we can make a good human-artificial ecosystem—a smart organization\nand a smart culture. In a way, we need to duplicate some of the early insights that\nresulted in, for instance, the U.S. census—trying to find basic facts that everybody can\nagree on and understand so that the transmission of knowledge and culture can happen in\na way that’s truthful and social sampling can function efficiently.\n\nWe can address the problem of building an accurate credit-assignment function in\nmany different settings. In companies, for instance, it can be done with digital ID badges\nthat reveal who’s connected to whom, so that we can assess the pattern of connections in\nrelation to the company’s results on a daily or weekly basis. The credit-assignment\nfunction asks whether those connections helped solve problems, or helped invent new\nsolutions, and reinforces the helpful connections. When you can get that feedback\nquantitatively—which is difficult, because most things aren’t measured quantitatively—\nboth the productivity and the innovation rate within the organization can be significantly\nimproved. This is, for instance, the basis of Toyota’s “continuous improvement” method.\n\nA next step is to try to do the same thing but at scale, something I refer to as\nbuilding a trust network for data. It can be thought of as a distributed system like the\nInternet, but with the ability to quantitatively measure and communicate the qualities of\nhuman society, in the same way that the U.S. census does a pretty good job of telling us\nabout population and life expectancy. We are already deploying prototype examples of\ntrust networks at scale in several countries, based on the data and measurement standards\nlaid out in the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOn the horizon is a vision of how we can make humanity more intelligent by\nbuilding a human AI. It’s a vision composed of two threads. One is data that we can all\ntrust—data that have been vetted by a broad community, data where the algorithms are\nknown and monitored, much like the census data we all automatically rely on as at least\n\n138\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016358",
