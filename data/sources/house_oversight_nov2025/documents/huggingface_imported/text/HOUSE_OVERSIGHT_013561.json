  "text": "the other way. Theorists call this characteristic sign of bifurcation land, hysteresis. It\nis generally known that sudden healing changes of the first born again experience\ncan arrive magically fast whereas a run at it a second time, another born again state\nafter the loss of the first one, comes, if at all, with much more effort and difficulty.\nMembers of Alcoholic’s Anonymous know that getting on the AA wagon the first\ntime may be quick, joyful and easy. Getting back on this wagon after a fall is much\nmore painfully slow and demanding, analogous to the Carmalite monk; St. John’s\nlost faith engendered suffering of the Dark Night of the Soul.\n\nViewing the instabilities and extremes near the boundary of a bifurcation\nbrings inquiries and advice about why a rational compromise, some form of\ndisciplined moderation, would not be more desirable. It turns out that in this\nparameter regime, the in-between state is intrinsically inaccessible. The pocket in\nthe S shaped fold of the upper manifold cannot be attained, at least for very long, by\nvarying the values of the two parameters. However, if one increases the number of\ncontrols, it might be possible to stabilize a small island in a parametric sea of\ninstabilities. In an application of this strategy, Smith College and Harvard Professors\nJames Callahan and Jerome Sashin used a geometric representation of the difficult\nto stabilize region of normal weight on a double cusp manifold representing the\nbehaviors of patients with eating disorders with both anorexia nervosa and bulimia.\nThey varied five controls to stabilize a very small result area representing normal\neating by varying the control values for ability to verbalize feelings, to imagine\nsolutions, to defend against anxiety with unconscious forgetting called repression, to\nmake contact with realistic rationality and to modulate feelings with say exercise,\nmeditative practice or psychopharmaceuticals.\n\nMy experiences with the so-called borderline personality, with the tendency\ntoward sudden and global personality change, from Sunday school teacher to Harlot\nin the space of a breath, has been both sexually exciting and personally ruinous for\nme in my life. | could feel the instabilities in these dwellers of the bifurcation pockets\nand my heart raced at the promise of mutually unconsidered impulses, the blurring\nof orificial identities, the experiments with sexual roles and modes and the\n\nincipiency of collapse into regressive mud play.
