  "text": "Chris Anderson’s company, 3DR, helped start the modern drone industry and now\nfocuses on drone data software. He got his start building an open-source aerial robotics\ncommunity called DIY Drones, and undertook some ill-advised early experiments, such\nas buzzing Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory with one of his self-flying spies. It\n\nmay well have been a case of antic gene-expression, since he’s descended from a founder\nof the American Anarchist movement. Chris ran Wired magazine, a go-to publication for\ntechno-utopians and -dystopians alike, from 2001 to 2012; during his tenure it won five\nNational Magazine Awards.\n\nChris dislikes the term “roboticist” (“like any properly humbled roboticist, I\ndon’t call myself one”). He began as a physicist. “I turned out to be a bad physicist,” he\ntold me recently. “T struggled on, went to Los Alamos, and thought, ‘Well maybe I’m not\ngoing to be a Nobel Prize winner, but I can still be a scientist.’ All of us who were in\nPhysics and had these romantic heroes—the Feynmans, the Manhattan Project—realized\nthat our career trajectory would at best be working on one project at CERN for fifteen\nyears. That project would either be a failure, in which case there would be no paper, or\nit would be a success, in which case you'd be author #300 on the paper and become an\nassistant professor at Iowa State.\n\n“Most of my classmates went to Wall Street to become quants, and to them we\nowe the subprime mortgage. Others went on to start the Internet. First, we built the\nInternet by connecting physics labs; second, we built the Web; third, we were the first to\ndo Big Data. We had supercomputers—Crays—which were half the power of your phone\nnow, but they were the supercomputers of the time. Meanwhile, we were reading this\nmagazine called Wired, which came out in 1993, and we realized that this tool we\nscientists use could have applications for everybody. The Internet wasn’t just about\nscientific data, it was a mind-blowing cultural revolution. So when Conde Nast asked me\nto take over the magazine, I was like, ‘Absolutely!’ This magazine changed my life.”\n\nHe had five children by that time—video-game players—who got him into the\n“flving robots.” He quit his day job at Wired. The rest is Silicon Valley history.\n\n103\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016906",
