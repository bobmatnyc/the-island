It was not easy as people from LifeBall are very difficult. But I go it (they even now approved you - they
needed to do a background check believe it or not! — as on that dinner will be president of Austria, Clinton etc)
for two tickets — for you and your guest for a price that you do not need to buy a table (as they do not sell
individual seats).

Guy below is a good friend and he is a CEO of amFAR (amFAR has a joined dinner) — so he helped.

The nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all
party access.

I have the same ones (through Bill).

I also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so I reached to Kevin for help.

The price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as I think the regular one for this is 15K and it is
hard to get it). They will need an email from someone from your office and name a your guest asap.
The plan for for Vienna I am sending you with my next email!
