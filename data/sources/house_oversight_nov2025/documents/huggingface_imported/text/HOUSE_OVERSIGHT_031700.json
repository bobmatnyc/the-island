They must enjoy\ngridlock, partisanship, incompetence, economic stagnation and avoidance of responsibility.\nAnd fewer people voted.\n\nBut as we awake from the nightmare, it is important to eschew the facile explanations for the\nRomney defeat that will prevail among the chattering classes. Romney did not lose because\nof the effects of Hurricane Sandy that devastated this area, nor did he lose because he ran a\npoor campaign, nor did he lose because the Republicans could have chosen better\ncandidates, nor did he lose because Obama benefited from a slight uptick in the economy\ndue to the business cycle.\n\nRomney lost because he didn't get enough votes to win.\n\nThat might seem obvious, but not for the obvious reasons. Romney lost because the\nconservative virtues - the traditional American virtues — of liberty, hard work, free enterprise,\nprivate initiative and aspirations to moral greatness - no longer inspire or animate a majority\nof the electorate.\n\nThe simplest reason why Romney lost was because it is impossible to compete against free\nstuff.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031700",
