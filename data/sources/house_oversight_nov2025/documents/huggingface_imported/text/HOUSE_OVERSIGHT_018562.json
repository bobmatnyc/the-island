  "text": "experience, even from police and doctors. (An older female friend of mine who was\nraped in 1970 once told me that she tried to talk to a psychiatrist about what happened.\nHe sighed and said, \"Really, do you think that's important?\") Rape Victim Advocates has\nalways been a network of volunteers who are on-call to come and talk to rape survivors,\nbut since 1974, it has also developed from a fragile activist group into one with funding\nand political presence.\n\nAnd on a somewhat different note, S&M community organizing is really quite good. A\nlot of people don't realize that most S&M community dungeons (unlike the professional\ndungeons run by sex workers) are nonprofit organizations, kind of like community\ncenters. (No, seriously.) People don't just go to community dungeons to do S&M -- they\nalso go to community dungeons for discussion groups or educational workshops, to learn\nhow to perform certain activities safely.\n\nMuch like Jane, the S&M community has also created a network of necessary references:\nthe Kink Aware Professionals list. If you've read my work before, you've probably read\nabout this list, because it had a huge impact on my life and I like to spread the word.\nS&M activists in San Francisco realized, years ago, that there was a need for lawyers and\ndoctors who understood their lives and wouldn't stigmatize their choices, so they wrote\nthree names on a piece of paper and passed it around. Now, the Kink Aware\nProfessionals list is an international online directory hosted by the nonprofit National\nCoalition for Sexual Freedom.\n\nAgain, it's not like there are no problems in the S&M community; people gossip, people\nbackstab, people fuck up. There's little vetting process for educators or for people who\nlist themselves on Kink Aware Professionals, and a lot of people run kink classes at least\nas much from a desire for status as from a desire to educate. But still, I think the S&M\ncommunity is engaging in positive activism... more than a lot of us even realize.\n\nThis was a lesson that really hit home for me when I spent a year in Africa working on\nHIV mitigation. One of the reasons international aid is so complicated is that figuring out\nhow to help a community that's not yours is incredibly hard. A lot of well-meaning\nAmericans (including myself) go abroad with little understanding of how hard it is. The\nreality is that assisting with, for example, public health in a foreign place entails learning\nthe social fabric of that country in a way that outsiders can only do with tons of sustained\neffort... and we're still unlikely to be as good as someone who grew up there. One of the\nreasons -- maybe the biggest reason -- I left was that it was so obvious to me that I was a\nbetter activist in the USA... even when I wasn't trying to do activism. (When I was there,\nI received one letter from an American girl asking for advice on how to do African\nactivism. My advice to her can be summarized as, \"It's harder than you think, and you\nmight consider staying home where you're awesomer.\")\n\nWhen HIV began destroying the gay community, the most effective and important\nmeasures to curb it came from people like Richard Berkowitz, the actual gay activist who\nwrote a safer sex pamphlet on his home typewriter and then distributed it by hand. They\nsaw a need and they did something about it. Just like Jane. Just like S&M educators.\n\nYou are probably already part of more communities than you might realize. If you go to a\nuniversity, you're part of that community. Whether you live in a city neighborhood or a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018562",
