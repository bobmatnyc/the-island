  "text": "From: Jeffrey Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSent: 3/8/2011 1:48:24 AM \nTo: Darren lndyke \nDetails of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily \nMail uncovered logs of telephone messages left at his Florida child sex den. \nSchoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages \nfor the 58-year-old billionaire friend of Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex \noffences. \nGhislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is \nnamed in several messages. \nIn one left for her or 'Sarah', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come \nthis night for the massage'. Other messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, \ncontain such phrases as: 'She has females for Mr JE' and 'I have a female for him'. \nAnother with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just \ndid a good one — 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, \"I love Jeffrey\")'. \nThe long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends \nincluding the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and \nmagician David Copperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. \nThe sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of \nwhich were 'erotic' and allegedly involved the abused girls. \nThe evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into \nEpstein and seen yesterday by the Mail. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030519 \nMessage from a child asking what time to leave school \n---n-----e-__ \nMiss Maxwell is asked when a girl should give a massage \nOne message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in \nschool.' \nIt was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted \npolice to Epstein's abuse. \nAnother note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class — will be out in \n45 mm.' \nLast night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers \nare included in the logs. \nOne girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about \nEpstein. \nA man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.' \nRead more: http ://www. dailymail. co .uk/news/article-13 640 1 0/Did-Prince-Andrew-fix-Fergies-bailout-\nBillionaire-paid-debts-days-princes-visit.html#ixzzlFyMDA8If \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
