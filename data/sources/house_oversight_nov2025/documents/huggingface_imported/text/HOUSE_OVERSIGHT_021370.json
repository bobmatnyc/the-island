Unlike relations with human\nothers, which are situation-sensitive and\nthereby susceptible to change of\ncharacter, rupture, and decline, God,\nChristians believe, is with one, whatever\nhappens, in exactly the same capacity--\nas the creator and sustainer of whatever\nit is that remains good about one’s life,\nbe that only at a minimum the bare fact\nthat one continues to live. The Christian\nwho believes God is his or her creator is\ntherefore confident that God continues to\nwork for his or her ultimate good, that\nGod is engaged in the effort to increase\nit, whatever the impediments in human\nlife suggesting the contrary, absent, that\nis, almost any confirming evidence.\n\nThe Problem of Inattention\n\nAlthough invisibility and\napparent absence do not pose the same\nproblem here as they do when God is\none’s friend, this rather more impersonal\nunderstanding of God’s influence as\ncreator and sustainer has its own\nproblem maintaining a strong sense of\nconnection to God. The diffuseness of\ninfluence that lies behind God’s constant\ninvisible presence can prompt simple\nChristian inattention to God. The very\nmonotony of the always pertinent\nChristian affirmation that everything is\nto be attributed to God can make that\naffirmation recede from focal awareness,\nmake it fail to come focally to mind.\nBelief in God’s uniform presence would\nthereby become functionally\nindistinguishable from the sense of\nGod’s absence. The invisibility of God\nthat follows from a belief in the\ncomprehensiveness of God’s influence\nsimply means in that case that God drops\n\n124\n\nPage\n\nout of sight and mind, drops out of\nChristian consideration for most intents\nand purposes, most of the time. Such a\nGod has little to offer as a “para-social”\nentity, as a factor fomenting or\nsupplementing a sense of social\nconnection.\n\nIn the back of their minds\nChristians may believe that God is the\nsource of everything, but they may not\nfeel compelled to consider that fact\nactively in the course of their everyday\nlives. God hides behind, so to speak, all\nthe creaturely influences that God is\nworking through, which become matters\nof primary Christian preoccupation. At\nthe center of attention are all the\nordinary influences and connections with\none’s natural and human environments;\npreoccupation with them pushes out of\nfocal awareness the fact of God as the\nultimate source of them all. Apart from\nspecifically religious obligations—say,\nthe demand to give God thanks and\npraise at times of worship—Christians\nwho believe God is their creator would\nhave no particular reason to dwell on\nthat fact.\n\nChristian theologians commonly\ntie this sort of practical worry--about\nwhat from a Christian point of view\namounts to sinful neglect of one’s\nconnection to God--to the understanding\nof double agency in the account of\ncreation I sketched above.“ According\nto that account, it is true, God’s\ninfluence on human life does not have to\ngo by way of the human and natural\ncausal powers and influences on human\nlife that God creates; God can influence\nhuman life without producing sufficient\ncreated causes for what God wants to\nhappen in human life. (The Christian\nclaim that Jesus was resurrected from the\ndead—an event without natural causes--\nis a case in point, one that Christians are\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021370",
