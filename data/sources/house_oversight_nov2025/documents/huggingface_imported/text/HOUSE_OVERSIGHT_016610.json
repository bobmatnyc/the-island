Case # 07-2097, 333 Sunset Ave., Royal Poinciana South\n\nViolation of Chapter 134, Section 134-416 (d), Section 134-417 and Section 134-\n418 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, when any building or\nstructure or part thereof which is nonconforming is altered, changed or replaced,\nthe non-conforming building or structure or part thereof shall thereafter conform\nto the regulations of the district in which such building or structure is located and\nthe terminated nonconformity shall not thereafter be resumed nor shall any\nadditional nonconformity be permitted.\n\nLead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said this case had previously been heard\nand was remanded back to the Code Enforcement Board by the Circuit Court.\nThe case has been previously postponed due to the attorneys for 333 Sunset Ave.\nbeing on vacation. Mr. Walton said the Town is asking that the case be postponed\nagain because Mr. Castro, the Zoning Administrator, could not be present today.\n\nMOTION BY MR. KOEPPEL TO RESCHEDULE THE CASE UNTIL\nMAY 15, 2008\n\nSECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG\n\nMOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY\n\nMr. Hoffman addressed a question to Sgt. Krauel or Lead Code Enforcement\nOfficer Walton as to whether people were starting to pay more attention to Code\nEnforcement or perhaps fewer violators were found this month. Mr. Walton said\nthe Town was getting better compliance and perhaps these agendas would be even\nshorter in the future. He said the word was out that not only were the Code\nEnforcement officers looking harder but the Board is not being as generous with\nthe time but still being fair. Mr. Hoffman said he needed to compliment the Town\nCouncil on their efforts to make Code Enforcement an important part of making\nthe community a more habitable place. He said he also wanted to compliment the\nStaff for doing that for the Town.\n\nCaptain Blouin said when Code Enforcement was first transferred to the Police\nDepartment, things were structured a little differently. In the past, it had been\ntreated more leniently. The citizens did not take it seriously because they believed\nthey were\n\ngoing to keep getting more time. He said some of the earlier cases when the Police\nDepartment took over were more than a year old when they came before the\nBoard. The police department changed it so the cases are before the Board more\nquickly. Many of the attorneys who were known to defend the code violation type\nof cases initially were very combative. That attitude has now changed and they are\ncontacting the Police Department to see what they need to do to come into\ncompliance. Captain Blouin said he wanted to thank the Board for their efforts in\nmaking this happen within the community because it is making code enforcement\nmore efficient in the Town.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016610",
