  "text": "A Single Point of Failure | 247\n\nthe U.S. exercise, including deliberately “trapping” him in Moscow,\nwas to “demonize” him. “There was no question that I was going\nto be subject to a demonization campaign.” Snowden said in Mos-\ncow, “They [Greenwald and Poitras] actually recorded me on camera\nsaying this before I revealed my identity.” Snowden asserted this\n“demonization” was to divert attention from the government’s own\ncrimes. By providing Snowden with this platform to rail against the\nputative machinations of the United States, Putin laid claim to the\nmoral high ground.\n\nSnowden’s motive in requesting documents from other foreign\nintelligence services, such as the GCHQ, and copying lists of NSA\nsources remains unexplained. It is difficult to believe that his motive\nwas whistle-blowing, because these documents were not among\nthose he gave to journalists in Hong Kong. Indeed, he did not pro-\nvide the journalists with the lists of sources that were particularly\nrelevant to the NSA’s surveillance of Russia. His legal represen-\ntative in Moscow, Kucherena, confirmed that Snowden had taken\nsecret “material” to Russia and had access to NSA documents that\n\n© he had not given to journalists. Those unrevealed documents would ©\nbe prized by many an adversary service. Did he use those documents\nas leverage in his transformation? The role that Moscow might have\nplayed in Snowden’s defection clearly requires a closer examination\nof the machinations that brought Snowden to Russia. That is why I\nvisited Moscow in October 2015.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 247 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019735",
