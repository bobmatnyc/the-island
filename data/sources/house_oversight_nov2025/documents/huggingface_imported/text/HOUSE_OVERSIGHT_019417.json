A system built to\nimport oil and deliver it to coastal refineries has become ill-equipped to handle rising production in Texas, North Dakota and\nCanada's Alberta province.\n\n\"All of the pipes are pointed in the wrong direction,\" says Harold York, an oil researcher at Wood Mackenzie. \"We are turning\nthe last 70 years of oil-industry history in North America on its head, and we are turning it on its head in the next 10 to 15\nyears.\"\n\nWith oil prices persistently above $100 a barrel, companies drilling new wells don't want to forgo revenue while they wait\nyears for new pipelines. That leaves them with trucks, trains and barges to move an increasing amount of crude.\n\nOil delivered to refineries by trucks grew 38% from 2011 to 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,\nwhile crude on barges grew 53% and rail deliveries quadrupled. Although alternatives are growing rapidly, pipelines and\noceangoing tankers remain the primary method for delivering crude to refineries.\n\nIn the Eagle Ford, a large four-year-old South Texas oil field, production has grown to more than 500,000 barrels a day, from\nless than 1,000 in 2009, according to state statistics. Getting that torrent out of the sparsely populated region has required\nmodifications to the oil-delivery system.\n\nFor example, last year NuStar reversed a 16-inch pipeline built to carry crude imported from Africa and Europe northward\nfrom the Port of Corpus Christi. Now, the pipeline flows south, taking delivery from hundreds of trucks that fill up at individual\nwells. Some of the 175,000 barrels a day moving through the pipe is loaded onto barges at Corpus Christi and towed toward\nrefineries near Houston.\n\nEarlier this year, Phillips 66 began putting some of this crude on ships for a 2,200-mile journey around Florida to its refinery\nin Linden, N.J.\n\nThe heavy trucks moving Eagle Ford crude are causing headaches for residents and local officials, ripping up roads and\ncausing traffic tie-ups.\n\n\"These are rural roads built for 10 cars an hour, and now it's 100 vehicles an hour, and 75 of them are 80,000-pound trucks,”\nsays Tom Voelkel, president of Dupre Logistics LLC. The Lafayette, La., company started hauling crude in Eagle Ford in\nNovember 2011 and has more than 100 drivers full time in the region.\n\nThe Texas Legislature appropriated $450 million this year to repair and improve roads in oil-producing counties. \"It doesn't\neven begin to reach where it needs to reach,\" says Daryl Fowler, the chief elected county official in Cuero, Texas, about a\n\nhundred miles southeast of San Antonio.\n\n\"We've seen a fourfold increase in congestion around here,\" he says. \"The roads are crumbling.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019417",
