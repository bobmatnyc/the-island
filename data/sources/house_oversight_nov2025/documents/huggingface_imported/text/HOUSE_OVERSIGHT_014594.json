  "text": "incorporates this view, as we are neutral on the\neuro, yen and pound versus the US dollar, but\nremain bearish on the Chinese renminbi.\n\nWe discuss our view on the broader US dollar,\nas well as each of these currencies, next.\n\nUS Dollar\n\nFollowing three consecutive years of dollar\noutperformance, it would be reasonable to assume\nthe up-cycle is nearing an end. After all, dollar\nvaluation is now close to its historic average level\nrelative to the currencies of US trade partners, after\nadjusting for inflation. Moreover, the length of this\ndollar bull market is approaching that of the two\nprior episodes shown in Exhibit 71 and shares a\nsimilar underlying driver—tighter monetary policy\nin the US relative to its global peer group.\n\nBut while we expect the pace of US dollar\nappreciation to slow, there are many reasons\nto believe the greenback’s outperformance can\ncontinue this year. Dollar valuation remains\nbelow the peaks reached in the 1985 and 2002\nbull cycles, suggesting it is not yet prohibitively\nexpensive. The dollar should also benefit from\nsolid US macroeconomic fundamentals relative to\nother developed economies. President-elect Trump\nran on a platform that includes fiscal expansion\nand corporate tax reform. Although his economic\nteam’s spending plan is still forthcoming, the\npackage could represent an economic tailwind that\nmay justify tighter US monetary conditions at a\ntime when foreign central banks have committed\nto easier policy. In turn, relatively higher US yields\nmay entice global investors to favor US dollar\nassets over lower-yielding foreign-denominated\nalternatives.\n\nFurthermore, some elements of the new\nadministration’s desired corporate tax reform\ncould present material upside risk to the US dollar.\nFor example, the destination-based tax system\nsupported by several House Republicans disallows\ndeductions for any imported good or service—\n\nDollar gains are likely to be more\nmodest and reflected in a narrower\nset of currencies as the dollar bull\nmarket enters its fifth year.\n\nExhibit 71: US Dollar Real Effective Exchange Rate\nDollar valuations are near their long-term average but below\nlevels reached in past bull cycles.\n\nZ-Score\n\n6.3 Years\n\n6.8 Years 5.4 Years\n\n1g\n1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 = 2008 =—.2013\n\nData through November 30, 2016.\nNote: Z-score is calculated on data since 1973 and represents the number of standard deviations\n\nfrom the mean.

Economic theory suggests that\nfree-floating currencies such as the US dollar\nwould need to adjust higher by the amount of\nthe tax to create equilibrium with similar goods\nsourced across foreign borders. Taken at face\nvalue, this implies a 20% destination tax would\nrequire a simultaneous—and potentially very\ndisruptive—20% increase in the US dollar. A tax\nholiday for cash held abroad could be similarly\ndollar positive, in spirit if not in magnitude. While\nit is true that a majority of the $2.6 trillion of US\ncorporate earnings trapped overseas are already\nheld in US dollar assets, the greenback would still\nenjoy a tailwind if corporates elected to repatriate\nsome portion of the foreign currency balance.\nThat said, the risks to the US dollar are not\nexclusively to the upside, as much of the good\nnews is embedded in current prices (see Exhibit\n72). Consider that the bulk of last year’s dollar\nadvance occurred in the two weeks following the\nUS presidential election in November, as\nthe market quickly discounted a portion\nof potential policy changes. Moreover,\nFederal Reserve rate hike expectations\nfor 2017 have increased following\nstronger US activity data during the\nsecond half of 2016. Lastly, we expect\nthe BOJ and ECB to maintain their\nhighly accommodative policies again\nthis year.
