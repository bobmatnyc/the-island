GOP fundraiser Broidy under investigation
for alleged effort to sell government
influence, people familiar with probe say

Carol D. Leonnig

The Justice Department is investigating whether longtime Republican fundraiser Elliott
Broidy sought to sell his influence with the Trump administration by offering to deliver U.S.
government actions for foreign officials in exchange for tens of millions of dollars,
according to three people familiar with the probe.

As part of the investigation, prosecutors are scrutinizing a plan that Broidy allegedly
developed to try to persuade the Trump government to extradite a Chinese dissident back to
his home country, a move sought by Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to two of the
people.

They are also investigating claims that Broidy sought $75 million from a Malaysian business
official if the Justice Department ended its investigation of a development fund run by the
Malaysian government. The Malaysian probe has examined the role of the former prime
minister in the embezzlement of billions of dollars from the fund.
