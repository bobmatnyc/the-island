  "text": "28\n\nRepublicans in Congress, he suggested, would shred that tradition\nunder cover of a debate that is only nominally about the budget. “The\nfact is,” he said, “their vision is less about reducing the deficit than it\nis about changing the basic social compact in America.”\nConservatives would and did object to his implication of\nheartlessness, but not necessarily to his assessment of their ambition.\nThe Republican plan put forward by Representative Paul Ryan of\nWisconsin, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and adopted by\nthe House on Friday as its policy blueprint for the next decade\ncontains a substantial dose of deficit reduction but is really a\nmanifesto for limited government.\n\nIt would take big steps toward privatizing Medicare, slash upper-\nincome tax rates, repeal last year’s health care law, bite deeply into\nnearly all federal programs and try to cap the size of government\nrelative to the economy. But it also imposes a self-consciously moral\njudgment on the government’s role, suggesting that the same kind of\ndemand for added personal responsibility that was embedded in the\n1996 overhaul of welfare should now be applied more broadly, to\nfood stamps, housing aid and health care for the elderly and the poor.\n“The safety net should never become a hammock, lulling able-bodied\ncitizens into lives of complacency and dependency,” Mr. Ryan’s\nbudget proposal says.\n\nWilliam A. Galston, who was a domestic policy aide to President Bill\nClinton and is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said Mr.\nRyan deserved credit of a sort for addressing head-on the\nimplications of the Republican Party’s increasingly rigid antitax\nposture, which since it took root in the late 1970s has put greater and\ngreater pressure on budgets and the social programs they support.\n\n“It represents the first serious effort to begin to bring Republican\nsocial policy commitments in line with their fiscal and tax\ncommitments,” Mr. Galston said.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023485",
