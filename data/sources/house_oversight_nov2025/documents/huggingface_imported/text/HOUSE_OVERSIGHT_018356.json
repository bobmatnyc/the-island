  "text": "the Baby Boomers. Had they been the most destructive, selfish generation in\nAmerican history? A reaction against the selflessness of their parents? Retired to\nleave the rest of us to pay their future medical bills and oggle their underfunded\npensions, to cope with the manipulated political system they’d sued into existence.\nOr had they left a legacy of tolerance, an echo of 1968's optimisitic energy, a firming\nof American confidence. But, anyhow, Generation X? By comparison irrelevant: A\ncollection of sad, passive slackers.\n\nBut the great Internet companies were largely built by Generation X. The\nfoundational experience of 1989 - the fall of the Berlin Wall - bred optimism. It\ncreated, in fact, the possibility for a new exploration. When we were told “Be\ngenerous in what you accept,” this seemed reasonable and, eventually, lucrative. The\nlogic and power of networks became apparent by itself, the moment we began\nconnecting the world. So linkage in trade and finance and friendship was pressed\nout into a new era of globalization, pushed as much by the smashing, enthusiastic\nremoval of so many historical limits as it was by the technology itself. Yes WiFi and\nTCP/IP and other advances made wiring the world possible, but I wonder if they\nwould have developed so quickly if the context for using them hadn't provided a\nfeedback loop of such quick profit and reward and, frankly, amazement. So, in this\nfashion, we laid the groundwork for a world of billion-plus user platforms. For a\nnew concept of power.\n\nBut the Snowden papers were a shock. We knew him, in a sense. His mannerisms\nand thinking and technical instincts harmonized with our own. It was as if the NSA\nhad enrolled most of the digitally visible world into a twisted panopticon of a social\nnetwork, one where your “membership” began the moment one of your data\npackets was sniffed or chased along fiber optic lines. Here was a secret three billion-\nuser platform, in a sense, that had enmeshed, without their knowledge or\npermission, a tremendous chunk of humanity. People of interest. The one or two or\nthree billion people swept into systems like the NSA’s Aurora fell victim to the\npowerful leverage of scaled systems: The more people monitored by the NSA, the\nmore leads to follow, which meant still more people needed to be followed and\nknitted unwittingly into the web.\n\nNo one in my generation who had been around tech for long was naive. We knew\nthat like soldiers coming back from a war there were things done on the network -\nthe spreading of danger, of inequality, of pollution - that would have to be paid for\nin balance by the benefits the system promised to bring. The immensity of what had\nbeen built already in networks was clear enough; the even greater power yet to\ncome as trillions of more connections piled together was implicit, obvious even. The\nperverse, sneaky side of this growth was known to anyone who'd spent time\nworking a connected machine. But that people of our generation could on the one\nhand listen to “Karma Police” and on the other enact the sick OK Computer logic of\nsurveillance, even name a British GCHQ monitoring program after the Radiohead\nsong? The aim: Provide \"either (a) a web browsing profile for every visible user on\n\n124\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018356",
