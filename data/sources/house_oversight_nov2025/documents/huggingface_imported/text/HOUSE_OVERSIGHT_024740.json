(We expand on these\npredicted developments in Chapter IV, U.S. Legal Landscape.) We believe that federal legalization will\ntrigger rapid growth in the U.S. market, propelled by interstate commerce, access to the federal bank-\ning system and acceleration of the cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals market. A change in the federal\nstatus of cannabis in the United States will not only drive U.S. market growth, but should provide a\nsignificant catalyst to the market worldwide.\n\nIncreasing Awareness of the Medical Efficacy of Cannabis. In aggregate, across all U.S. state laws,\ncannabis is legally recognized as a form of therapy or medicine for more than 50 medical conditions.\nIn addition, at least 20 countries have medical laws that facilitate patient access to cannabis or concen-\ntrates for treating specified medical conditions. We believe that countries and U.S. states will continue\nto adopt and enhance legal frameworks for the medicinal use of cannabis products. In addition, we\nbelieve that many more cannabis consumers will emerge as research on cannabis increasingly demon-\nstrates its medical efficacy and as more therapeutic products are developed and brought to market.\n\nIncreasing Recreational Legalization. Most laws facilitating access to cannabis, both in U.S. states\nand abroad, are medical laws. However, Uruguay and eight U.S. states have enacted recreational laws\npermitting the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational and other uses\n(and Canada is widely expected to do so in mid-2018). In the handful of jurisdictions that started\nwith medical laws and later adopted recreational laws—particularly in Colorado, Washington and\nOregon—adoption of recreational laws has led to significant growth in overall market size and a rapid\nincrease in the percentage of the market represented by recreational consumers. We expect 2018 will be\na watershed year for the recreational market, with the implementation of California’s new recreational\nlaw and the expected approval and implementation of Canada’s recreational law. If these laws stimulate\ndemand, as expected, and are otherwise viewed as successful, we expect more U.S. states and additional\ncountries to follow suit with similar laws.\n\nBroadening Range of Cannabis Consumer Products. Product innovation and advancements in can-\nnabis varieties, concentrates, infused products, vaporizing technology and cannabis-derived pharma-\nceutical products will drive consumer adoption and spending. Cannabis consumer product companies\nwill seek to differentiate their products through marketing, distribution, packaging, selection, quality\nand pricing. We believe that product differentiation and availability will be more prevalent in legal\ncannabis markets and will drive consumer transition from illegal to legal markets.\n\nDeclining Prices in U.S. State-Legal Cannabis Markets. The supply of cannabis has increased con-\nsiderably with expanded state legalization in the United States. This increase has started to dampen\nretail and wholesale prices in various markets. As prices decline, we are starting to see closer price par-\nity between state-legal and illegal markets (in the United States, cannabis is generally priced lower in\nillegal markets than in state-legal markets). Lower retail prices in state-legal markets should accelerate\nconsumer transition from illegal to state-legal markets and drive increased overall penetration rates.\nHowever, state and local taxes will continue to impact pricing for cannabis products in state-legal can-\nnabis markets.\n\n104 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024740",
