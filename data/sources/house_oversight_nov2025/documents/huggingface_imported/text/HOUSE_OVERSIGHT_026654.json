  "text": "Dhabi\n\nAGT was responsible for installing a “unique civil surveillance network in Abu Dhabi that means ‘every person\nis monitored from the moment they leave their doorstep to the moment they return to it,’” according to the noted\n\nsecurity publication MiddleEastEye.<http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israel-surveillance-2 104952769>\nThe invasive system is dubbed “Falcon Eye”.\n\nKochavi also owns Israeli security and private intelligence firms 3iMind and Logic Industries. Like Vocativ,\n3iMind claims to use “the deep web” to mine information, though in 3iMind’s case it provides spy services, not\njournalistic ones. 31Mind even advertises online that it will spy on “the planning and execution of violent civil\n\nunrest” for clients.<https://www.3i-mind.com/use_cases/political-social-unrest/>\n\nThe website for Kochavi’s mother company<https://www.agtinternational.com/about/>, AGT, claims its current\nbusiness is using “Internet of Things” technology for entertainment and “fashion” applications in partnership\nwith the giant talent agency WME-IMG ... though it’s unclear what any of these applications really\nare<http://www.curoleague.net/final-four/berlin-2016/news/1/6vokoibj5fsgqg4q/heed-the-event-platform-based-\njoint-venture-between-wme-img-and-agt-international-makes-first-official-foray-into-sports>, and certainly\nwhat value they provide for entertainment. Security experts say Internet of Things type sensors could be tied\ntogether to monitor crowds for security purposes.\n\nAccording to Israeli and U.S. Jewish publications, the lines within Kochavi’s companies can blur, with Vocativ\nemployees doing work for 3iMind and Logic, and vice versa. So who was this “journalist” arrested amid the\nunrest on Inauguration Day? Was he actually doing journalism? Or, as some journalists around town have been\nasking, could he also have been doing surveillance of anti-Trump demonstrators on behalf of an Arab or Israeli\nclient, possibly a foreign government?\n\n[http://heatst.com/wp-\n\ncontent/uploads/2017/01/aaeaaqaaaaaaaag Saaaajdq3mjuxmegu2ltgSnjmtndilmelhzmrhltllyjkynze5zjlimg.jpg?w\n=300]Kochavi employee Evan Engel (LinkedIn)\n\nA call to Ruemmler was returned by someone identifying himself as a Vocativ spokesperson. He told Heat\nStreet that the arrested employee, Evan Engel, was doing purely journalistic work at the time he was detained.\n\n“The arrest, detainment and rioting charge against journalist Evan Engel who was covering the protests for\nVocativ are an affront to the First Amendment and journalistic freedom,” the spokesperson said. “Vocativ will\nvigorously contest this unfounded and outrageous charge.”\n\nKochavi has taken pains to put a different face, unrelated to spying and surveillance, on his American activities.\nVocativ acts like a news organization, though it’s made little splash (and gets remarkably little web\ntraffic<http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/vocativ.com>) for an operation so large and expensive.\n\nKochavi has also shown little hesitation to pay top dollar for access to the most powerful figures in America to\nprovide legitimacy for his American activities. Last fall’s Wikipedia data dump revealed that he and his\nlongtime business partner, New York rainmaking lawyer Mary Edelman, offered Bill Clinton millions of dollars\nto serve as honorary chairman of the company that would become Vocativ. <http://heatst.com/biz/wikileaks-\nbill-clinton-turned-down-8-million-to-be-honorary-chairman-of-news-site-vocativ/> Clinton turned them down,\nperhaps nervous about Kochavi who’s been described as “a mysterious even somewhat shady character” and the\nIsraeli “version of the old-fashioned arms dealer with a suit and an MBA” by the progressive Jewish blog\nTikkun Olam.<https://www.richardsilverstein.com/2014/12/04/israeli-cyber-security-merchant-peddles-wares-\nsecretly-in-united-arab-emirates/>\n[http://heatst.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/akochavivivian.jpg?w=260]Matania Kochavi (C) shown with\nVivian Schiller (L) chair of Vocativ’s executive committee and Danna Rabin (R) AGT’s chief operations\nofficer.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026654",
