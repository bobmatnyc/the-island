  "text": "Critical mistakes in its infancy would never let me sell it. I could hire magic elves and connect my\nbrain to a supercomputer—it didn’t matter. My little baby had some serious birth defects. The question\nthen became, How do I free myself from this Frankenstein while making it self-sustaining? How do I pry\nmyself from the tentacles of workaholism and the fear that it would fall to pieces without my 15-hour\ndays? How do I escape this self-made prison? A trip, I decided. A sabbatical year around the world.\n\nSo I took the trip, right? Well, Pll get to that. First, I felt it prudent to dance around with my shame,\nembarrassment, and anger for six months, all the while playing an endless loop of reasons why my cop-\nout fantasy trip could never work. One of my more productive periods, for sure.\n\nThen, one day, in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suffering would be, I hit upon a gem of\nan idea. It was surely a highlight of my “don’t happy, be worry” phase: Why don’t I decide exactly what\nmy nightmare would be—the worst thing that could possibly happen as a result of my trip?\n\nWell, my business could fail while I’m overseas, for sure. Probably would. A legal warning letter\nwould accidentally not get forwarded and I would get sued. My business would be shut down, and\ninventory would spoil on the shelves while I’m picking my toes in solitary misery on some cold shore in\nIreland. Crying in the rain, I imagine. My bank account would crater by 80% and certainly my car and\nmotorcycle in storage would be stolen. I suppose someone would probably spit on my head from a high-\nrise balcony while I’m feeding food scraps to a stray dog, which would then spook and bite me squarely\non the face. God, life is a cruel, hard bitch.\n\nConquering Fear = Defining Fear\n\nSet aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and\ncheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: “Is this the condition\nthat I feared?”\n\n— SENECA\n\nTren a funny thing happened. In my undying quest to make myself miserable, I accidentally began to\n\nbackpedal. As soon as I cut through the vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare,\nthe worst-case scenario, I wasn’t as worried about taking a trip. Suddenly, I started thinking of simple\nsteps I could take to salvage my remaining resources and get back on track if all hell struck at once. I\ncould always take a temporary bartending job to pay the rent if I had to. I could sell some furniture and\ncut back on eating out. I could steal lunch money from the kindergarteners who passed by my apartment\nevery morning. The options were many. I realized it wouldn’t be that hard to get back to where I was, let\nalone survive. None of these things would be fatal—not even close. Mere panty pinches on the journey\nof life.\n\nI realized that on a scale of 1-10, 1 being nothing and 10 being permanently life-changing, my so-\ncalled worst-case scenario might have a temporary impact of 3 or 4.I believe this is true of most people\nand most would-be “holy sh*t, my life is over” disasters. Keep in mind that this is the one-in-a-million\ndisaster nightmare. On the other hand, if I realized my best-case scenario, or even a probable-case\nscenario, it would easily have a permanent 9 or 10 positive life-changing effect.\n\nIn other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10,\nand I could easily recover my baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to. This all\nequated to a significant realization: There was practically no risk, only huge life-changing upside\npotential, and I could resume my previous course without any more effort than I was already putting\nforth.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013825",
