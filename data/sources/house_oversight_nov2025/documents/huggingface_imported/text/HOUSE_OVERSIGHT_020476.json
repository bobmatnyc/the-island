The issues are complicated and have no simple\nsolutions. Various specialists within and outside the US government should be consulted\n\nin determining the full scope of the problem and what should be done.\n\nPromote Integrity\n\nCongress needs also to distinguish between issues that present a real threat to the United\nStates, such as Chinese espionage and Chinese-directed monitoring of Chinese students\non US campuses, and institutions such as Confucius Institutes, which, as we have noted\nelsewhere in this report, can be better regulated by universities themselves.\n\nPromote Reciprocity\n\nIn coming up with remedial steps, Congress must consider the broader bilateral relationship.\nIt is asked to weigh carefully the continued important positive elements in the US-China\nrelationship, the negative consequences that might arise from a confrontational approach\n\nto China, and America’s need to protect and foster its strengths and interests.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 Sources for the information and judgments in this section include: United States Congress.
