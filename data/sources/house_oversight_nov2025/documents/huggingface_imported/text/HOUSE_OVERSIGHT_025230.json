  "text": "Eye on the Market | August 4, 2011 J.P Morgan\n\nToday\n\nthe Delaware, with the caption “America’s structural resilience, fortitude and ingenuity will carry the economy and financial\nmarkets in 2011 —and beyond”. Our job is not to point to where we would like the financial markets to go, but rather\nto point to where they might end up. It’s like the scene in Oliver Stone’s Nixon, when Nixon looks up at a portrait of JFK\nand says, “When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look at me, they see what they are.” Our job is\nto see financial markets for what they are.\n\n6. All that said, we have lessons to learn here.\n\nToo many of our investment discussions this year focused on the negative real return characteristics of cash,\nand why to reduce it. In a world of deflation risk on financial assets (rather than of goods and services),\ncash retains substantial option value at times like these.\n\nWe could have connected the dots more aggressively on our views on Global monetary and fiscal policy\nweak growth and easy monetary policy, and owned more gold. While %p.a.\nwe have had rising price forecasts for gold and owned it in portfolios, 5\nwe did not have large enough allocations.\n\nChg in net fiscal “e-pt\n\nlending\n\nGiven the all-time high of US government transfers to households and\n\nnegative real interest rates, we should not have interpreted positive 3 A\neconomic data earlier this year as being highly representative of the 2\ntrue run-rate of the US economy. The same goes for the global ‘ 4\neconomy, which as shown in the chart from JP Morgan Securities, has : 4\nbeen the beneficiary of a lot of stimulus that is now fading, for a ; Policy rate :\n\nvariety of economic and political reasons. 02 04 06 08 10 12\n\nGreat corporate profits are no guarantee against a problem in financial markets. Corporate profits and P/E\nmultiples were fine in June 2007, but rested on top of a systemic problem in private sector credit markets and\nprivate sector balance sheets. This year, strong corporate profits and low P/E multiples sit on top of systemic\nproblems in public sector finances.\n\n7. Inthe wreckage, as usual, there are opportunities, and we will be reviewing them with you in the days ahead. There is a\nbenefit to having held back on our firepower this year. With risk to spend held in reserve, there are oversold assets with\nconsidering, particularly among multinationals with strong balance sheets, high dividends and which trade at very low\nmultiples, something we reviewed earlier in the week.”\n\nMichael Cembalest\nChief Investment Officer\n\nThe material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.
