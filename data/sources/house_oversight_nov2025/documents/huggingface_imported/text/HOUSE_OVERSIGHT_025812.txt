yes agree

result got worse with recent negative press, clinton, as we discussed

we were down to | negative (forbes) before that - Christina can confirm this.

It will get back to 1 and then 0 so long as negative things stop coming out. if new negative keeps coming out it
really dismantles much of our effort... especially when it involves an ex-president

no excuses here i'm not pleased with where it is at and am still working to make it happen

Hi Tyler,
The social media sites are constantly updated: LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, google +.
I'll be in touch later today re: feature article.

Could you put a site map into the Net site.? This helps rankings. Also could you add it to google analytics
using Jeffrey's gmail account? This allows me to monitor it's progress and index it periodically.

I'll call you later. Thanks,
Christina
