  "text": "Though we realize this fact, the Council of Ministers has lately decided to establish the Emirates Council for\nCompetitiveness. Its task is to develop strategies and suggest policies and legal frameworks that can support the\ncompetitive environment in the light of local, regional and international variables. These frameworks serve the\nobjective of comprehensive development, and protect the Emirates position among the most competitive states\non the international arena.\n\nThe Council consists of a number of ministers concerned with this question. It is headed by the Minister for\nCabinet Affairs, and includes the Ministers of Economy and Foreign Trade, Education, Labor, Health, the\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, and for Financial Affairs. In addition, there are seven representatives of\nadministrative boards in the local governments, the chairman of the Union of Trade and Industry Chambers in\nthe State, Directors of Trade and Industry Chambers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We are confident that the\nCouncil is able to draw strategies and legislative frames to secure the desired development of the competitive\ncapacity of the UAE.\n\nBy Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper\n\nIn the first quarter of t his year, accelerating economic events have generated pessimism\nabout the future of the global economy and its growth. There are conflicting reports in\nthe assessment of the national economy, and we read some of the studies questioning the\ncontinuation of Western-style development plans and their future in the region in light of\ndeclining oil prices and the global crisis. What is the assessment of Your Highness on the\nnational economy today, can it be maintained at the level of growth in the light of the\nretreat of oil prices? What is the policy that the UAE will use with regard to the latest\ndevelopments of the global financial crisis?\n\nOur economy is strong and its potential lies in its great diversity. The proportion of oil in the UAE’s GDP is less\nthan 30 percent, and this reduces the impact of oil price fluctuations on the national economy. I agree with you\nregarding the presence of many pessimistic reports on the world economy, but it’s an exaggerated and\nunrealistic pessimism. Countries with the largest economies are seriously committed to rehabilitating the\neconomy, while the summit of the Group of Twenty came out with encouraging results after meeting in London\nrecently. Our hope is to commit ourselves to the implementation of all decisions. In fact, the negative vibrations\nwill decrease, and will be substituted by cautious optimism. As for the levels of growth, few states in the world\nare likely to maintain high levels of growth recorded in recent years. We in the UAE wi Il achieve economic\ngrowth rates lower than those recorded in previous years.\n\nBy Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper\n\nAttracting foreign investment was among the priorities of the UAE. Today, the \"flight of\nforeign investors\" from the UAE is widely discussed in the media, and is supported by\nboth local and official reports. Does Your Highness really think that our national\neconomy’s dependence on foreign investment leads to future risks? In the frequent talk\nabout the global financial crisis, does Your Highness have new plans to strengthen,\ndevelop or restore foreign investments to the country?\n\nWe cannot use the term \"flight of foreign investors\" because there has been no “flight.” What happened exactly\nis the drought of liquidity across the world immediately after the collapse of the American investment bank,\nLehman Brothers, which marked the beginning of the global financial crisis. However, with this drought, the\ncompilation of available sources of liquidity became the primary concern of investors, banks, and financial\ninstitutions throughout the world. Sizeable withdrawals, deposits and liquefaction of all financial centers\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024947",
