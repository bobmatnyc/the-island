  "text": "Photo: George Rose/Getty Images\n\nBroadcom has adjusted its takeover offer for Qualcomm to $79 per share, down from\nthe its “best and final” bid of $82. The move is a response to Qualcomm's\nannouncement yesterday it would pay $127.50 a share for NXP, up from the $110 it\nhad offered.\n\n° Why it's the BFD: Broadcom and Qualcomm's takeover dance has taken a\ndramatic turn for what should have been a boring transaction between two chip\ncompanies.\n\n° Bottom line: \"Broadcom has long said its acquisition of the San Diego-based\nchipmaker is contingent on Qualcomm buying NXP at the previously agreed price,\nsaving a large amount of cash Broadcom could hypothetically use for its own purposes\nonce the acquisition goes through... Qualcomm raised its NXP bid to secure support\nfrom activist investors who have piled into NXP and demanded a higher sale price.\" —\n\nBloomberg.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020146",
