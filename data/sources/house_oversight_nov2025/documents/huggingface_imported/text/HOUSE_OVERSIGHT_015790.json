He had discovered ‘X’ rays; so called because he had no better\nname for them. X-rays, as they became known, are just light of a very\nhigh frequency.\n\nLight comes in a variety of colors; at the low end of the frequency\nscale we see red, higher up blue and, at the top, violet. At this point\nhuman eyes give up and cannot see anything higher, so ultraviolet\nlight is invisible to us. Bees, on the other hand, can see a long way into\nthe ultraviolet spectrum and some flowers have beautiful ultraviolet\nmarkings that attract bees for pollination. Daylight contains a great\ndeal of ultraviolet light which is wasted on us — other than to tan our\nskin. But all is not lost. Clever manufacturers put fluorescent dyes\ninto their washing powders which stick to our clothes and convert\nultraviolet into visible light, making our T-shirts look brighter as they\nreflect more visible light than fell on them. You can see this effect most\neasily in a disco when ultraviolet lights are shone on the dance floor\nand anyone wearing a newly washed T-shirt will glow bright white. The\nother common substance that fluoresces strongly on a dance floor is\ntonic water.
