  "text": "The Six Dumbest Decisions of My Life\n\nI' m talking here about seriously dumb decisions, not those minor\nregrets like that time in 1970 when £squire magazine assigned me to fly to\nNew Mexico where director Monte Hellman was filming 7wo-Lane\nBlacktop, about street-racing. Among the actors was a pair of musicians,\nJames Taylor as a driver, and Dennis Wilson as a mechanic. They both\nagreed to be interviewed, besides screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer and others.\n\nDuring a conversation with Taylor about not laughing at jokes, he\nsaid, “My brother once told me a joke that made me laugh.”\n\n“Wait, don’ t tell me now,” | said. “Let’ s save it for the\ninterview.”\n\nHowever, | was supposed to reveal behind the scenes of making the\nmovie, but | learned that there were a couple of violations of law: A few\nmembers of the cast had been tripping on magic mushrooms; and a 17-\nyear-old actress, Laurie Bird, who played “The Girl,” had sex with two\nmembers of the crew. Nine years later she would commit suicide.\n\nAnyway, | decided not to write the article--| was a reporter, not a\nsnitch--and never did get a chance to do any interviews. Nor did | ever\n\nhear the joke that James Taylor’ s brother told him and made him laugh. |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015440",
