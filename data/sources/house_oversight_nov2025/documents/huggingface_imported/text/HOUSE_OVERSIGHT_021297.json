  "text": "Sultan (who had studied psychology)\nand his “lie-detecting” donkey. Lore has\nit that the Sultan was missing a valuable\nvase from his estate and suspected that\none of his servants had stolen the piece.\nTo identify the culprit, the Sultan\ngathered his servants in front of a dark\nroom in which a donkey was tied, and\nthen asked each of his servants if they\nhad stolen the item. Each said “no”. The\nSultan explained that inside the room\nwas a magical donkey, specially trained\nto detect liars, who would bray when\nslapped by someone who had lied. The\nservants were sent into the room, one by\none, and were instructed to close the\ndoor, slap the donkey and return. “When\nthe donkey brays,” the Sultan\nproclaimed, “I will have my culprit”.\nThe first servant was sent into the room\nand returned shortly thereafter--\ntremendously relieved as the donkey had\nnot brayed. One by one, the remaining\nservants entered the room and returned.\nThe donkey had not brayed and all the\nservants looked quite relaxed. The\nSultan was sanguine -- he knew this\ndonkey never brayed under any\ncircumstances. The Sultan asked the\nservants to show him their hands. He\nthen pointed to one of them and declared\n“we have our thief,” instructing the\nguards to take him away. How had he\nidentified the culprit? Rather than\nrelying on a magical donkey, the Sultan,\nwho recall was a student of psychology,\ntook a more rational approach.\nUnderstanding the impact of beliefs on\nbehavior, the Sultan had surreptitiously\ninfiltrated powdered charcoal into the\ndonkey’s hair. When the servants\nslapped the donkey, the charcoal marked\ntheir hands—with the exception of the\nguilty servant who had not slapped the\ndonkey, out of a belief and associated\nfear that the donkey could detect a liar!\n\nPage |51\n\nPower of Beliefs\n\nBeliefs may be potent\ndeterminants of behavior, but can they\nkill? And if so, how? How can these\ninvisible, intangible entities impact\nhealth? In a now classic article published\nin the American Anthropologist in 1942,\nWalter Cannon, a leading Harvard\nphysiologist and expert on the\nautonomic nervous system, proposed an\nanswer (1). Investigating phenomena\nsuch as voodoo practices of the Haitians\nand “bone-pointing” among Australian\naborigines, Cannon found a common\nfeature among the victims of such rituals\nwas a strong belief in the curse and an\nassociated morbid fear of the outcome.\nThat fear, he argued, could trigger a\n“fight-or-flight reaction” (a phrase he\nhad earlier coined), characterized by\npowerful and exaggerated activation of\nthe sympathetic nervous system. The\nresulting vascular constriction\ndiminishes blood flow to critical tissues\n(i.e., ischemia), with consequent hypoxia\n(decreased oxygen) and disturbances in\nnormal metabolism and cellular\nfunction. These reactions may be\nexacerbated by the lack of food and\nwater as the victim “pines away.”\nCannon argued that these reactions could\nbecome life-threatening—fulfilling the\ngruesome legacy of the ritual—based on\na belief in the supernatural, the veracity\nof which is largely irrelevant. More\nrelevant is the emotion triggered by the\nbelief, specious as it may be.\n\nBeliefs and emotions have\nconsequences, both behavioral and\nphysiological. A recent example comes\nfrom the contemporary medical\nliterature. There is now a well-\ndocumented condition, sometimes\ntriggered by something as innocuous as a\nspousal argument or a surprise birthday\nparty, which entails the hallmark clinical\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021297",
