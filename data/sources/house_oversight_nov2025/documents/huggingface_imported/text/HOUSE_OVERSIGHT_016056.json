This was used in the mining industry but also extensively in\nweaponry, so he came to be known as the Merchant of Death during his\nlifetime.\n\nTo be known as the merchant of death would have a profound effect\non anyone. As Nobel pondered the balance of his life’s work he decided\nto do something positive with the huge wealth he had accumulated. On\nhis death in 1896, he willed his entire fortune to create the awards we\nnow call Nobel Prizes.\n\nThere were five original prizes; physics, chemistry, peace, physiology\nor medicine, and literature. A newer economic science prize is awarded\nby the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nYou must be alive to receive a Nobel Prize; a few have been\nawarded posthumously because the laureate died after the winner was\nannounced but before the award ceremony. The work must have been\nproven experimentally, and although originally it was supposed to be for\ndiscoveries in the previous year, nowadays a theory must have stood the\ntest of time. Consequently, winners tend to be quite old. The prize must be\nfor something with practical applicability — Einstein received his Nobel\nPrize for the Photo Electric Effect, rather than his more famous Theory\nof Relativity. The judges evidently thought particles more practical than\nplanets! The prize is usually awarded to a maximum of three people. This\nhas produced some controversial results but despite this the Nobel Prize\nis the uncontested top prize in science.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016056",
