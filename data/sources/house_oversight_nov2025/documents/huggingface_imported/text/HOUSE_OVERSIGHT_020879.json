These surpluses were invested in a\nspecial (non-marketable) series of U.S. Treasury securities, which were then used to finance budget deficits\nin other parts of USA Inc. like Medicaid & Nutrition Assistance.\n\ne As aresult, many observers have argued that Social Security and Medicare Part A Trust Funds’ balances\nare no more than accounting gains on paper owing to: 1) no ‘real’ assets (such as tradable stocks / real\nestates...) in these Trust Funds as the special U.S. Treasury securities are non-marketable and 2) the\nTreasury Department needs to raise taxes / cut other programs’ spending / borrow more money in the future\n\nto meet any withdrawal requests.\n\ne We think that for Social Security and Medicare Part A programs, their Trust Funds’ balances have legal\nvalue as USA Inc. is legally obliged to repay the principal and interest on the Treasury securities held in\nrespective Trust Funds.\n\ne However, we think that these Trust Fund balances have NO economic value as these cumulative surpluses\nhave been spent by USA Inc. to reduce the borrowing need in the past. When Social Security & Medicare\nbegin net withdrawal from their Trust Funds (likely in 2017E), USA Inc.’s debt levels + interest payments\ngrowth could accelerate, owing to the double whammy of: 1) loss of revenue source (previous surpluses)\nand 2) additional Treasury redemption costs related to Trust Funds’ withdrawal requests.\n\ne Consequently, we exclude Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds’ balances and interest income\nfrom our financial models and calculate their liabilities on a net basis.\n\nData source: Social Security Administration, Dept. of Health & Human Services, CBO.
