No attempt was made to reconcile Torah (scripture) and Madah (secular\nknowledge). They were simply distinct and entirely separate world views (or as my late colleague\nSteven Jay Gould put it in his always elegant choice of words, \"separate magisteria\"). We lived\nby the rule of separation between church and state, and for most of the students it raised no issue\nof cognitive dissonance. In the morning, they thought like rabbis; in the afternoon like scientists;\nand there was no need to reconcile. It was like being immersed in a good science fiction novel or\nfilm: one simply accepted the premises and everything else followed quite logically.\n\nFor a few of us, that wasn't good enough. I recall vividly our efforts to find--or contrive--\ncommon ground. For some, this quest took them to wonder whether the God of Genesis could\nhave created evolution. For them there was an abiding faith that both religion and science could\nboth be right. For me, the common ground was an abiding conviction that both could be wrong--\nor at least incomplete as an explanation of how we came to be. I was skeptical of both religion\nand science. Genesis, though elegant and poetic, seemed too simple. But so did evolution--at\nleast the way we were taught it.\n\nThe apparent conflict between religion and science did not move me to search for reconciliation.\nIt moved me to search for doubts, for holes (not black ones, but grey ones), for inconsistencies\nnot between religion and science--that was too easy--but rather within religious doctrine and\nwithin scientific \"truth.\" I loved hard questions. I hated the easy answers often given, with a\nsmirk of self-satisfaction by my religious and secular teachers.\n\nThe mission of our modern Orthodox Yeshiva was to integrate us into the mainstream of\nAmerican life while preserving our commitment to modern Orthodox Judaism. “Torah” and\n“Madah” were the two themes. Torah, which literally means bible, represented the religious\ncomponent. Madah, which literally means knowledge, represented the secular component. They\nwere thought to be reconcilable, though little explicit effort was directed at reconciling the very\ndifferent world views implicit in the relatively closed system of Orthodox Judaism and the\nopenness that is required to obtain real secular knowledge. When it came to culture, however,\nthere was actually very little conflict, because becoming good Americans—including immersing\nourselves in mainstream American culture—was part of the mission of our schools. Of course I\nhated anything the teachers tried to imbue in us, because with a few exceptions, they taught by\nrote and memorization. Although I was good at memorization, I rebelled against the\nauthoritarianism implicit in religious teaching.\n\nAs much as I hated my teachers, they hated me even more. I loved conflict, doubt, questions,\ndebates and uncertainty. I expressed these attitudes openly, often without being called on. I was\nrepeatedly disciplined for my “poor attitude.” My 6\" grade report card, which I still have, graded\nme “unsatisfactory” in “deportment” and “getting along with others.” I received grades of D in\n“effort,” D in “conduct,” D in “achievement,” C in spelling, D in “respects the rights of others,” D\nin “comprehension,” C+ in geography and A in “speaks clearly.” One teacher even gave me an\n“unsatisfactory” in “personal hygiene.” My mother, who was meticulous about cleanliness and\nscrubbed me clean every day before school, complained. The teacher replied, “his body is clean,\nbut his mind is dirty; he refuses to show respect to his rabbis.”\n\n24\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017111",
