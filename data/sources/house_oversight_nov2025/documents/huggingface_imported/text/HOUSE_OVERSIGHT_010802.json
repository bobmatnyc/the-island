Who told you that the manifests confirm\nthe accuracy of your publie statements?\nMR. SCOTT: If it involves lawyer-client\nprivilege, don't answer it.\nTHE WITNESS: Okay.\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\nQ. You're refusing to answer?\nA. No, I would like --\nMR. SCOTT: Instruct you not to answer.\nA. -- to answer. But I've been instructed\nnot to answer. I would like to answer.\nYou've made a statement --\nMR. SCOTT: There's no question pending.\nTHE WITNESS: But he made a statement --\nMR. SCOTT: But there's no question\npending, sir.\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\nQ. What does it mean to make something up out\nof whole cloth?\nA. It means that Virginia Roberts and your\nclients --\nQ. No, sir, | haven't asked you anything\nabout Virginia Roberts. | haven't asked you\nanything about my clients.\n\nOo On HU WN PR\n\nNNNNNNPFP RF PR PPR PR\nUP WNP Ow OY HU PWN RO\n\n255\n\nMR. INDYKE: Objection. This is Darren.\n\nAnything that relates to your conversations\n\nwith Jeffrey --\n\nTHE REPORTER: He's going to have to speak\nup.\n\nMR. SCOTT: You're going to have to speak\nup a little bit more, Counsel.\n\nMR. INDYKE: Objection. This is Darren\n\nIndyke. Anything that Alan might have to say\n\nto that, to the extent they are covered under\n\nconversations with Jeffrey Epstein, privileged\n\nunder attorney-client privileges as well as\ncommon interest privileges.\nMR. SCOTT: Do you understand?\nTHE WITNESS: I do.\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\n\nQ. To which your response was: \"Sure, sure,\ncertainly I have been his lawyer and J did speak to\nhim about it. I wanted to make sure that his memory\nand mine coordinated about when I was at his island.\nHe was able to check. I was able to check. |\nchecked with my friends who went with me.\"\n\nDid you make that answer to that question?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Disclosing the contents of your\n\n254\n\n1 want to know what the words \"making\nsomething up out of whole cloth\" mean.\n\nA. 1 said those words in the context of\nVirginia Roberts.\n\nMR. SCOTT: That's -- that's fine. Go\nahead.\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\n\nQ. What do the words mean?\n\nA. That there was absolutely no basis for\nVirginia Roberts' claim that she had any sexual\ncontact with me. That the story was entirely false.\nI don't know where the metaphor derives about whole\ncloth, but certainly that's the common\nunderstanding. And I repeat under oath that\nVirginia Roberts made up the entire story about\n\nhaving sexual contact with me out of whole cloth.\n\nQ. During the course of the same interview\nthat we have been referencing with Hala Gorani —~\nfor the record, that's H-A-L-A, G-O-R-A-N-I.\n\nA. What page?\n\nQ.

INDYKE: Again, this is Darren Indyke.\nJeffrey does not waive any attorney-client\nprivileges here.\n\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\n\nQ. Well, the reason why you were able to\nanswer that question and discuss with the press what\nJeffrey Epstein was telling you was because you\nweren't his lawyer at that time, right?\n\nA. No, I was his lawyer at that time. I'm\nstill his lawyer.\n\nQ. Oh, what were you representing him on\nthen --\n\nA. The ongoing --\n\nQ. -- that is, on January --\n\nMR. SCOTT: Whoa.\n\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\n\nQ. -- on January 5, 2015?\n\nA. The ongoing --\n\nMR. INDYKE: My objection stands.\n\nMR. SCOTT: You can answer what you were\nrepresenting him on, | think.\n\n20 (Pages 253 to 256)\n\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888) 811-3408\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010802",
