  "text": "O Schadenfreude\n\nOn February 15, 1978, a relatively unknown boxer with few professional fights, stepped into the Las\nVegas boxing ring and snatched the world heavyweight champion title from Muhammad Ali. Ah, along\nwith his entourage of managers, coaches and fans were shocked, though no one denied that he lost. The\nunknown boxer was Leon Spinks. His only prior claim to fame, and ticket to a shot at Ali, was an\nOlympic gold medal two years earlier. With this win, not only did Spinks enjoy the heavyweight belt of\nchampions, but a cash prize of $350,000 and a promise of $3.8 million for the rematch with Ali. But this\nmeteoric rise to the top fizzled into a meteoric crash, driven by women, alcohol, sports cars, and a lack of\ntraining. Leon Spinks, aka “Neon Leon,” was living the fast life, and rapidly losing his status as a\nrespected sports hero.\n\nMoments before his rematch with Ali, he cruised the streets of New Orleans on top of a limousine\nwhile smoking a joint. He was flaunting his nonchalance, making fun of Ali’s age, and carrying on about\nhis ability to take the old champ without a single work out. When he entered the ring, Ali was ready.\nThough the match went the full fifteen rounds, it was no contest. Ali won.\n\nNewspaper writers and boxing fans celebrated the return of their champion, and mocked the\ndownfall of an ephemeral, arrogant, and out of control hero. After losing to Ali in the rematch, Neon\nLeon crashed further, losing all of his earnings, taking on odd jobs for minimum wage, losing a son in a\ngang fight, and suffering defeat after defeat in the boxing arena. From envied millionaire sports star to\nbankrupt fool and the laughingstock of the boxing world.\n\nWhen the envied fall down, we perversely enjoy the knock out. This is schadenfreude, a German\nword that describes the joy we feel in witnessing another’s misfortune. Though the emotion is universally\nunderstood, recognized in our written records at least as far back as Aristotle, the German language is one\nof the few to capture the feeling by tapping the brain’s promiscuity, combining the word for harm\n(schaden) with the word for joy (freude). Like envy, schadenfreude is a social, comparative emotion. It\nerupts when those we envy fall down, when someone we dislike meets his comeuppance, and when a\nmisfortune is deserved. But like envy, schadenfreude presents two faces, one elevating and virtuous, the\nother deflating and divisive. We should feel good when a person is caught crossing a moral line,\ncommitting an injustice. Such feelings not only reinforce our own adherence to moral norms, but\nencourage us to punish those who transgress. Such feelings instill courage in the service of expressing\nmoral outrage. As Robert F. Kennedy stated “Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle\nor intelligence.” Schadenfreude in this positive sense is the inner voice of moral courage. At the same\n\ntime, it can also be the inner voice of moral disengagement, providing justification for an observed harm.\n\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 73\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012819",
