  "text": "I noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, insight-\nladen topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience\nwith symbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates with them.\nThe non-controversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while\nrarely offending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance).\n\nHe also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for\nhim. This invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very\nfew of his ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from\nothers.\n\nI am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. Joi\nis right. Public communication is about reaching one's goals.\n\nBests,\n\nJoscha\n\nOn Sun, Jul 10, 2016 at 12:42 AM, Joscha Bach re wrote:\n\nDear Jeffrey,\n\nthank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail.\n\nSorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive\nwhen I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam\n(who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not\nfeel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that\nhumans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other\nideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them.\n\nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a\ncultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that,\nbut it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a\nvery intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition\nworks layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few\nyears to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and\nafter the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts\nin child development, that have famously been described by Piaget.\n\nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The\nswitching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in\nother apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their\nbrains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations\nare quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in\nvery poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive\ndevelopment even after controlling for family income.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026416",
