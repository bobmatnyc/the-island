Last Friday | spoke ona\npanel in DC on the justice system. | was seated next to Justice Breyer and got to know him a bit. For what it is\nworth, he certainly seem to understand that the system is broken and | hear this more and more. Indeed, he made it\nvery clear that he thinks the sentencing system (which he helped form as a member of the Sentencing Commission)\nis broken and while you are past having to deal with that, | would like to think this raises some hope that the rest of\nthe system will improve if others in his position feel the same.\n\nTomorrow | go to Alabama to argue before the court of appeals regarding the constitutionality of Alabama's\nCommunity Notification Act, which the lower court struck down as unconstitutional already. Ultra right wing court\nand election year, so who knows; but these laws are so Draconian.\n\n| saw that the U.S. Attorney's office is appearing in your civil cases as well. Some strange folks in that\noffice. Anyway, | will look forward to talking and while all the judges are going to be tough, Judges Marra and\nJohnson so far have not been rubber stamps for government in my case and that means something.\n\nDavid\n\nEKER KEREREREEREREREREREREREREREREREREREEEE EERE EREREREREEE\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
