That’s the usefulness of disgrace.”\n\nAnd then there is too, that he is right. Since I began working on this\npiece in September, Epstein predictions about the price of oil, yen, ruble,\nand euro have all born out. (If I had invested $100,000 the way Epstein said\nI should in early September, by the end of January I would have made $2.3\nmillion. Alas, I did not.)\n\nAnd something else, which perhaps also surely accounts for Epstein’s\ncontinuing relationships with the rich and powerful:\n\nMost everyone who is now of a certain age and certain ambition and\ncertain status grew up in, and found they were temperamentally suited to, the\nnew age of wealth that started in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids,\nor, as Vanity Fair would baldly and ingratiatingly dub it, the new\nestablishment, an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at further\nand further remove from the ordinary one. In some sense, Epstein is just one\nversion, picaresque, as well as louche, of this shared story.\n\nHe often tells, with some obvious marvel, his middle class to riches\ntale. He was born in 1953 in Coney Island. His father worked for the city’s\nParks Department. His mother was a housewife. He has a younger brother,\nMark.\n\nEpstein was distinguished by little other than his math talents. The\ncaptain of the math team at Lafayette High school in Bensonhurst, he goes\non to Cooper Union where the tuition is free. He drops out after two years\nand begins taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematics.\nThen, without a college degree, hence by a slight of hand, gets a job teaching\nmath and physics at Dalton in 1974. (A few years ago, during a chance\nencounter with a former Dalton math department chairman, Margo Gumport,\nI asked her about Epstein. She said he was the most brilliant math teacher at\nDalton in her 50-year career and that she had often wondered what had\nbecome of him.)\n\nIt’s his first exposure to the wealthy. They have, he concludes, just as\nmany problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost\ninvariably involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a science\nexperiment,” he recalled not long ago as we chatted about his life. “It did not\nreally involve me. I could just stand back and watch.”\n\nDalton fathers were attracted to him. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher\nof the New York Times, and a Dalton father at the time, tried to recruit\nEpstein to come to the Times.
