  "text": "Dear reader,\n\nHaving lived in Uganda and spoken with people who escaped from the savagery of the brutal\ndictators Milton Obote and Idi Amin, having heard stories of my father’s childhood as a Jew running\nthrough Nazi occupied France, and reading past and present-day accounts of genocide, I am familiar with\nthe horrors of evil. I have also been a student of human nature, trained as a scientist. These experiences\nhave propelled me to study the causes of evil, attempt to make some progress in explaining it to myself,\nand hopefully to you. There is a great urgency to understanding this problem. None of us can afford to\npassively watch millions of individuals lose their homes, children, and lives as a result of malice. Sloth is\nasin, especially when we live in a world where cultures of evil can so easily erupt.\n\nTam also familiar with and deeply moved by human kindness, our capacity to reach out and help\nstrangers. When my father was in a boarding school in the south of France, hiding from the Nazis, a little\ngirl approached him and asked if he was Jewish. My father, conditioned by his parents to deny his\nbackground, said no. The girl, sensing doubt, said “Well, if you are Jewish, you should know that the\ndirector of the school is handing Jewish children over to the Nazis.” My father promptly called his parents\nwho picked him up, moved him to another village and school, and survived to tell the story. This little girl\nexpressed one of our species’ signature capacities: the ability to show compassion for another person,\neven if their beliefs and desires are different.\n\nIn preparation for writing this book, I read transcripts and descriptions of thousands of horrific\nevents, listened to personal stories of survivors from financial ruin and war, worked with abused children\nwho were crucified by unfit parents, and watched both fictional films and documentaries that portrayed\npsychopaths, dictators of totalitarian regimes, and their hapless victims. As one often does in these\ncircumstances, I developed a tougher skin over time. But I have never lost track of the human travesties\nthat result from evil. As my father’s story suggests, I have also not lost sight of the fact that we are a\nspecies that has done great good, and will continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, to provide a sound\nand satisfying explanation of evil we must avoid falling into more romantic interpretations of the human\ncondition. Our best protection is science. This is the position I will defend.\n\nThe topic of evil is massive. This is, however, a short book, written without exhaustive\nreferences, in-depth descriptions of our atrocities, and comprehensive engagement with the many theories\non offer to explain evil. What I offer is my own explanation of evil, of how it evolved, how it develops\nwithin individuals, and how it affects the lives of millions of innocent victims. It is a minimalist\nexplanation of evil that is anchored in the sciences. I believe, as do many scientists, that deep\nunderstanding of exceptionally complicated phenomena requires staking out a piece of theoretical real\nestate with only a few properties, putting to the side many interesting, but potentially distracting details.\nThis book extracts the core of evil, the part that generates all the variation that our history has catalogued,\nand that our future holds.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNu eon—\n\nHauser Evilicious.
