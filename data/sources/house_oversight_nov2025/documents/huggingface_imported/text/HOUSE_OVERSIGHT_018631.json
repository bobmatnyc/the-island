  "text": "emotional signals -- so tried inviting Richard for dinner, and he didn't answer my text\nmessages. When I finally ran into Richard, I asked why he'd been ignoring me, and he\nlaughed. \"I knew you'd accuse me of ignoring you,\" he said. I felt like I'd walked into a\ntrap.\n\nI was hurt, obviously. I was surprised by how hurt I was. The problem with my youthful\nwater metaphor is that water is basically invulnerable, but I am not... and when I was\nyounger and more open, I had much more trouble setting important boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, I had to admit that it was funny, too. I mean, it wasn't like I didn't see\nthis coming. I mean, my coming-out story includes a portrait of Richard at his most\ndifficult. One of the friends I share with Richard made a comment about leopards and\nspots. Maybe my life is a soap opera, but it could also be a sitcom with the most amazing\ncharacterization ever.\n\nI enlisted a cold, brilliant, evil-hearted friend to help draft my final letter to Richard. The\nletter was very short. Arguably, it was brutal. It read:\n\nEconomists recognize that the most robust relationships are formed through a plethora\nof implicit agreements. Apparently, these agreements are not present, and probably won't\nbe. Cheers.\n\nEconomics arguments in the comments are encouraged. More importantly, readers may\nfeel free to steal that letter for use on whoever is trying to pull their chain.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nI received a couple texts from Mr. Ambition, a few days after he gave me the fan. He said\nthere had been a death in his family. \"But I don't want to talk about that, actually,” he\nwrote. \"I just want to check in and see how you're doing.”\n\nI thought about how he laughed when he was hurt. I thought about how he'd once told me\nthat he wanted drama. I thought about his confusing reactions to S&M. I thought about\nhow he outsourced his emotional labor to his friends. I thought about all the emotion I'd\nfelt in him, coiled and caught and turned in on itself like a caged dragon.\n\nI wondered if he wanted me to push him to talk.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" I texted back. \"But I understand if you don't want to talk about it. I'm\ndoing fine.”\n\nHe invited me to a social event a week later, but I declined. I didn't reach out to him for a\nwhile after that, and he didn't reach out to me. I heard later that Mr. Ambition asked one\nof my friends whether they thought he owed me anything.\n\nMy friend told him, quite accurately: \"No, you don't owe her anything.\"\n\nIf anything, I owe him. I'm not sure what I owe him, but I'm sure I owe him something.\nA billion dollars? Vegan smoothies?\n\nChemistry?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018631",
