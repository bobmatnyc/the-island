  "text": "Colleagues cite chief's professionalism,\n\nREITER from IB\n\nney’s office for two reasons,\nFirst, he pressed for Epstein\nto be charged with the more\nserious crimes of sexual ac-\ntivity with minors. Second, he\nslammed State Attorney Bar-\nry-Xrischer in blunt language\nseldom used by one law-\nenforcement official con-\ncerning another because of\nwhat he perceived as that of\nfice’s mishandling of the\ncase.\n\n‘In a letter to Krischer\nwritten May 1, Reiter called\nhis actions in the Epstein\ncase “highly unusual.” He\nadded, “‘Imusturge youto...\nconsider if good and suffi-\ncient reason exists to require\nyour disqualification from the\nprosecution of these cases.”\n\nIn short, Reiter told the\ncounty’s top prosecutor for\nthe past 13 years that he\nought to get off the case. “It\n-looks like a departure from\n\nprofessionalism,” Muiami-\nDade State Attorney\nKatherine Fernandez Rundle\nsaid of Reiter’s letter.\n\nFollowing Epstein’s in-\ndictment, Reiter referred the\ncase to the FBI to determine\nwhether the super-rich,\nsuper-connected defendant\nhad violated any federal laws.\n\nReiter won't discuss the\ncase or the broadsides aimed\nat him. But others almost\nuniformly use one word to\ndescribe the chief: profes-\nsional. :\n\n“I have always been im-\npressed by Mike’s profes-\nsionalism and his leader-\nship,” said Rick Lincoln, chief\nof the Lantana Police Depart-\nment and a Palm Beach\nCounty cop for 32 years.\n\n“The town of Palm Beach\nhas a very professional police\ndepartment. We all consider\n\nMike to be our peer and 2 -\n\nman of integrity.”\n\nReiter: Town\nManager Peter\nElwell says the\nPaim Beach\npolice chief's\nwell worth his\n$144,000 sal-\nary.\n\nJuno Beach Police Chief\nH.C. Clark II agreed. Al\nthough he doesn’t know Re-\niter well, he has met with him\non countywide law enforce\nment issues. “I’ve never seen\nhim lose his cool. I've never\nseen anything but a profes-\nsional demeanor from him.”\n\nReiter joined the Palm\nBeach Police Department in\n1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year\npatrol job at the University of\nPittsburgh. His personnel\njacket shows consistently ex-\ncellent job evaluations.\n\nPosh Palm Beach is no\nhothed of crime, and in his\nfirst year on the job, a resi-\n\ndent confined to his home\nwith a sick child thanked Re-\niter for delivering afew Cokes\n\nto the house. Reiter refused -\n\npayment for the beverages.\nAnother resident thanked\nReiter for shutting off his\ncar’s headlights in his drive-\nway, saying a valet must have\nheen at fault.\n\nReiter worked everything\nfrom road patrel to organized\ncrime, vice and narcotics.\nAnd he’s no novice at investi-\ngations involving the island’s\nrich and famous. He was the\nlead detective probing the\ndrug overdose death of David\nKennedy in 1984. He also was\none of the officers who\nworked the investigation of\nWilliam Kennedy Smith, who\nwas charged in 1991 — and\nlater acquitted — with raping\n@ woman at the Kennedy\nfamily compound in Palm\nBeach.\n\nReiter, who has amaster’s\ndegree in human resource\n\nintegrity\n\ndevelopment from Palm\nBeach Atlantic University, al- .\nso has attended the FBI Na-\ntional Academy in Quantico,\nVa., and management cours.\n\nes at Harvard. He’s been cK\ntive in countywide interagen-\ncy law enforcement\norganizations and has a “top\nsecret” national security\nclearance.\n\n“He has a perspective\nthat’s broader than just ad-\ndressing the needs of the\ntown,” said Town Manager\nPeter Elwell, who promoted\nReiter from assistant chief to\nchief in March 2001. Reiter\nmakes more than $144,000 as\nthe town’s top cop. Elwell\nthinks he’s worth it,\n\n“He’s very businesslike,\nvery straighiforward. He's\n\nnot easily agitated or in —-\n\nboyant, He’s about the work,”\nElwell said. “I think that his\nservice as chief has been\noutstanding in  five-plus\nyears.”\n\n® lary_keller@pbpast.com\n\n03956-79\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019374",
