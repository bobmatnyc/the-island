  "text": "Central banks are seeking external assistance in\nbuilding internal capability as well as for investment\nstrategy and execution\n\nCentral bank decisions on the allocation and risk\nprofile of the investment tranche allocations are\ngenerally made internally. Reserves managers\n\nare seeking wider assistance in building internal\ninvestment frameworks to support their growing\nappetite for risk asset exposure, whether through\nasset management mandates or collaboration with\nacademic and multi-lateral institutions such as the\nWorld Bank. Central banks will continue to look to\nexternal managers for their technical advisory and\nsystems support (figure 34), as sovereigns have done\nover many years.\n\nWhile 87% of central bank respondents use an\nasset manager within their entire reserves portfolio,\nthere is less usage when building the first investment\ntranche (figure 35). This reflects a bias to first develop\ninternal capacity before outsourcing to external asset\nmanagers for alpha generation and expansion into\nnew asset classes. Central banks are reluctant to\nconvert relationships into ongoing mandates until\nthey have developed the capacity to oversee the risks\nincurred by external asset managers. Those that\nelect to allocate assets to external managers include\nrequirements to continue supporting central banks in\ndeveloping their own internal management capability.\nExternal managers must be patient and offer real\nvalue through transfer of experience, processes\nand technology, and must then have a sufficiently\ncompelling value proposition to sustain a long-term\ncommercial relationship.\n\n42\n\nFig 34.
