Importance: — High

I agree

Maybe then just stick to Sept 18th meeting - polite and courteous -

I will be respectful and deferential .

On the advice of Leonard I'm removing all criticism of scientists from the book

A production company in LA - connected to my son - is doing a documentary film on the new book .
They are looking for critics

I will film part of it as a lecture Al Gore * Inconvenient Truth " style in Nantucket .

I sent you the poster .

Can send it again by text

They would welcome his criticism

I think we should wait to discuss until Sept 18th unless you suggest we invite him on Sept 23 to Nantucket ?
I'm thinking what I should do with the Autumn of my life.

Will get clarity during silence .

The energy of pleasure has exhausted itself in me as also the energy that goes into " being right "

I'm ready to serve In a meaningful way

Love

Deepak Chopra

I just landed in NY

I'm staring a new phase in my life visa vis my relationship with my critics

2 scientific papers on my work will be out soon

Leonard read the new book and made some corrections so now 3 physicists have made sure that the science is
accurate

If you haven't sent the book to him please hold off so he gets a corrected copy.

I'm going to get off my high horse ( the tiger I can't ) and try and start a dialogue with anyone who is willing .
I will do as you guide me

I'm going this afternoon to NJ to do a fundraiser for an orphanage and then to Boston until Monday afternoon
Meeting Barnaby on Monday afternoon
