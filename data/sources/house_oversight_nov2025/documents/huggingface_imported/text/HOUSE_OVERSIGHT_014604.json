In high yield bonds, today’s below-\naverage spreads already reflect our subdued default\nexpectations and are less likely to offset any further\nincrease in rates. We thus expect returns of around\n4% in the year ahead. Although high yield energy\nis likely to generate similar gains, the potential\nupside is more significant given wider starting\nspreads and the potential for distressed bonds to\npull to par amid higher oil prices. Finally, with a\n5% return, bank loans should perform marginally\nbetter than bonds, reflecting their attractive\n0.25-year duration and continued investor demand\nfor floating rates—a feature that is back in vogue\nnow that 3-month LIBOR is almost above the\n1% LIBOR floor that more than 90% of bank\nloans possess.\n\nWhile these returns may pale in comparison to\nthose of last year, they remain attractive relative to\ninvestment grade fixed income, where we expect\nrising rates to generate lower returns. Even if rates\nstagnate while US growth remains positive, the\ndefault-adjusted return in high yield should still\ntrump high-quality bonds. Said differently, US\ncorporate high yield credit remains a better house\nin a bad fixed income neighborhood, supporting\nour modest overweight recommendation.\n\nExhibit 89: High Yield Credit Performance During\nPeriods of Rising Rates\n\nHigh yield has historically outperformed investment grade\nbonds during episodes of rising rates.\n\nAverage Return (%)} % of Time Positive\n\n5 @ Average Total Return During 100\nEpisodes of Rising Rates*\n4 © % of Time Positive (Right)\n75\n3\n2\n50\n1\n0\n25\n-1\n2 0\nInv.
