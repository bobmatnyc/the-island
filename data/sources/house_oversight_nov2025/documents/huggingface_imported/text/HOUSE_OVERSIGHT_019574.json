They contained the sort of\nSCI communications intelligence data that no major newspaper had\never published before. Their disclosure might result in journalists’\nbeing imprisoned, because both British law and US. law criminal-\nized the disclosure by anyone of communications intelligence. As a\nlawyer, Greenwald recognized this danger. On the other hand, the\nNSA documents were far more explosive than the WikiLeaks mate-\nrial and promised an even greater spike in circulation. So Greenwald\nassumed that Gibson would be willing to authorize their publication\nand provide the expenses for his trip to Hong Kong.\n\nHe flew from Rio to New York on May 30 to meet in person\nwith Gibson, who had concerns about publishing what were pur-\nported to be top secret documents that came from an anonymous\nsource.

The stolen NSA documents were\nanother matter. They were an enormous scoop that could have a\ngreater impact than the WikiLeaks scoop.\n\nGibson authorized Greenwald’s trip to Hong Kong on the con-\ndition that he take with him a Guardian staffer in whom she had\nconfidence, the Scottish-born Ewen MacAskill, a sixty-one-year-old\nveteran journalist who had been the Washington bureau chief for\nThe Guardian.
