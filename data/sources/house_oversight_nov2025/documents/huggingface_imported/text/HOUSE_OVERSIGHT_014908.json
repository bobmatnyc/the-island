We\nassume MAUs grow 16% y/y to 1.91bn and DAUs 16% to 1.26bn, keeping DAU/MAU at\na steady 66%. It’s possible (but hard to predict) that management offers an update on\nInstagram users (600mn MAU, 400mn DAU in 4Q}, and more specifically, Instagram\nStories (150mn DAU in January). On the messaging front, there could be a Messenger\nuser update (1bn as of 7/16), while a WhatsApp update is less likely (1.2bn as of 4Q16).\nWe expect ad impressions to grow 46% y/y (49% in 4Q) and ad prices to increase 2%\ny/y (3% in 4Q).\n\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n\n¢ Expense trajectory or lack of an expense guidance change could disappoint:\nWhile we continue to anticipate favorable revisions to management’s 2017 expense\nforecast in 2H, near-term adjustments may be less likely given the velocity of new\nproduct launches and potential video content investments.\n\n* 1Q ad revenue deceleration possible: We note that 4Q was particularly strong\nand it’s possible 1Q normalization could result in revenue growth deceleration.\n\n¢ Lack of commentary on monetization strategy: While Messenger/WhatsApp\nmonetization is likely still a 2018 story, lack of constructive commentary on timing\ncould disappoint.\n\n- User deceleration always a risk: MAU and DAU growth has surprised to the upside\nat mid-to-high teens y/y growth, and any meaningful slowdown could raise\ncompetitive concerns.\n\nTop 1Q data point: Instagram reaches 1mn advertisers\n\nMid-quarter data points were somewhat limited in 1Q, though management did give an\nupdate on the Instagram monetization efforts. In a March 2017 update, management\nindicated that Instagram grew to 1mn advertisers, double the number since 9/16, with\nbusiness profile pages up to 8mn from 5mn in 4Q. Facebook’s comparable metrics are\n4mn advertisers (as of 9/16) and 65mn business pages (4Q16).\n\nFor early advertiser checks, general feedback suggested positive trends, but more\n‘steady as it goes’ than absolute blow out. The stronger 4Q was highlighted as a tough\n\n; ; BankofAmerica <2”\n22 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014908",
