She recently emailed her former colleagues the\nfollowing idea:\n\nListen Up! The Republicans need to get the message from the majority of Americans that we value and need the benefits\nof Obamacare. Here’s how we do that.\n\nOn January 23rd, everyone who feels that way (our numbers are legion) sends a note to Donald Trump with a simple\nmessage:\n\n“Don’t make America sick again. Improve Obamacare. Don’t repeal it.\"\n\nOne envelope for every ACA supporter in your household...even if they are under 18 years old.\nJust that simple message.
