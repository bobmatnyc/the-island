Defense attorney Jack Goldberger claims that his\nclient, Jeffrey Epstein, had no idea that the untrained girls he hired for massages were\nminors.\n\nThe Palm Beach Count State Attorney's Office could have let a jury decide whom to\nbelieve. Instead, State Attorney Barry Krischer left the public to wonder whether the\nsystem tilted in favor of a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very\nyoung girls who are alleged victims of sex crimes.\n\nMr. Krischer took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which last month\nindicted Jeffrey Epstein on one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That decision\ncame after Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz met with prosecutors to undermine\nthe credibility of the 14- to 17-yearold girls who charged that Mr. Epstein had paid them\n$200 to $300 to undress and massage him in his five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath home on the\nIntracoastal Waterway.\n\nThe girls, Mr. Dershowitz told prosecutors, had written on myspace.com about smoking\nmarijuana and drinking alcohol. But if the girls have a credibility problem, what about\nJeffrey Epstein? Mr. Goldberger, told The Post: \"Mr. Epstein absolutely insisted anybody\nwho came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified that, I don't know.\" And\nprosecutors took him at his word?\n\nPolice collected evidence that refutes Jeffrey Epstein’s defense. Police searched his home\nand garbage and found phone messages about the girls’ school schedules and even a high\nschool transcript, suggesting that Mr. Epstein at least knew that the girls were teenagers.\nThe state attorney's office has responded to criticism from Palm Beach police and others\nby noting the higher standard prosecutors face for conviction than law-enforcement\nofficers do for arrest. But in this case, the state attorney bowed to the risk that a jury\nmight look at both Jeffrey Epstein and the girls, and point fingers at both sides.\n\nEven if the girls could be impugned as prostitutes, solicitation of a minor is a crime.\nFormer disc jockey and teacher Bruno Moore was charged with that Tuesday.\nInvestigators say the 34-year-old used the Internet - myspace.com - to recruit a 13-year\nold.\n\nPolice say Jeffrey Epstein used a 20-year-old woman who had a myspace.com\n\naccount to recruit young girls. His actions were sleazy. It would have been good to ask a\njury just how criminal they were.\n\nPalm Beach Post Editorial #3\n\nSpare us the outrage\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021766",
