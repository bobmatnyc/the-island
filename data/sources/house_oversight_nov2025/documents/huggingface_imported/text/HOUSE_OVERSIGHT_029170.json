  "text": "dismisses the argument made most aggressively by Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershowitz—who offers frequent legal advice to the\nPresident both in person and via television—and repeated recently by\nthe President, and in the recently revealed letter sent by his lawyers to\nthe Special Counsel in January, that a president cannot be prosecuted\nfor exercising his constitutional prerogatives, even if they foster crimes.\nAgain, the team argues that there is no statute or constitutional\nauthority that puts the President above the law or that allows him to\ncontribute to breaking the law.\n\nCuriously, the tradition breakers in the White House—supported\nby a many lawyers, both right and left leaning—now argue that the\nPresident's traditional and constitutionally mandated executive powers\ngive him wide latitude for how he carries out his duties. \"I don't think\nyou are going to find a court who will not see the president's role as\nunique,\" said one White House advisor. \"The Mueller theories are\nwishful thinking.\"\n\nSuch an indictment is described in similar ways by both Mueller\nand White House insiders: it puts the President's public behavior on\ntrial. The nature of that behavior, for the Mueller team, is corrupt; this,\naccording to the White House, is how voters elected the President to\nbehave.\n\nThe Mueller team may have a high hurdle in convincing\nRosenstein to approve the indictment. Giuliani recently put standing\nDOJ policy against the indictment of a president in hyperbolic terms: the\nPresident could kill James Comey if he wanted to without fear of\nprosecution. But, according to one former senior DOJ lawyer, Rosenstein\nin this circumstance may have the power to override the DOJ guidelines.\nThe Mueller team appears to believe that Rosenstein's pledge before\ncongress that, absent malfeasance, he will support the Special Counsel's\nindependence with regard to the Russian investigation, means he will\nlet the indictment go forward. In one view—and in the suspicion of\nsome in the White House—he may have already authorized Mueller to\nproceed with the indictment.\n\nThe counsel's office does, however, according to the papers I have\nreviewed, worry about the possibility that Trump will replace\nRosenstein with someone who will fire Mueller or curtail the\ninvestigation. Indeed, the Mueller investigation seems concerned or\nshadowed by daily procedural questions of an existential nature—\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029170",
