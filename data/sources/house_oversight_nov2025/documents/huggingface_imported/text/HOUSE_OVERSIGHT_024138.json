  "text": "Summary\n\n\"With the global\neconomy\ncontinuing to\nmuddle through,\nwe believe that\nUS corporate\nbonds offer the\nbest risk return.\"\n\n36 UBS\n\nEconomy\n\nThe successful formation of a Greek government after the June 17 elections has reduced\nthe risk of an imminent Greek exit from the Eurozone. However, the Euro debt crisis\npersists, and further reform and consolidation efforts in Spain and Italy are needed. In the\nUS, economic data weakened recently, but it remains in line with our forecast of moderate\ngrowth of around 2% in 2012. The Fed extended \"Operation Twist\" until the end of the\nyear and is ready to do more if the economic situation deteriorates materially. Meanwhile,\nChinese activity data is showing signs of stabilization and inflation remains low. We expect\nthe Chinese economy to gradually pick up in the second half of 2012.\n\nEquities\n\nDespite our relatively positive outlook for US and Chinese economic growth, ongoing\nEurozone issues keep us neutral on global equities. We think US companies are better\npositioned than their European peers, and thus keep our longer-standing preference for\nUS equities. US earnings are relatively robust and the recovery of the domestic economy\ncontinues to support revenues. Furthermore, we keep a moderate overweight in emerging\nmarket (EM) equities as valuations are attractive and we expect growth to accelerate in\nthe second half of the year. In the near term EM currency weakness remains a risk factor.\n\nFixed Income\n\nHigh grade government bond yields remain extremely low due to ultra-expansive\nmonetary policy and ongoing investor concerns over global growth. While we expect\nyields to only rise very gradually in the near term, we continue to see better investment\nopportunities in other fixed income segments. US high yield remains our favorite asset\nclass, given attractive valuations and a favorable default outlook. We also keep our\noverweight recommendations on investment grade and EM bonds.\n\nCommodities\n\nWe avoid broad commodity exposure as we see further price weakness ahead. While the\nworst of the oil sell-off is likely behind us, we see no reason for higher prices in the near\nterm and expect roll costs to weigh on positions.\n\nForeign Exchange\n\nIn light of the ongoing Eurozone troubles, we continue to prefer the US dollar over the\neuro. We also prefer the Canadian dollar, given its relatively good growth dynamics, a\npossible rate hike, and relatively high short rates.\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024138",
