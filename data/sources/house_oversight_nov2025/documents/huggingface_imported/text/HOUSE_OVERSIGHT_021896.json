I think\nthere were two depositions, if I recall correctly off\nthe top of my head, that I had an opportunity to review\nin which he took the 5th when asked questions about\nDershowitz.\n\nSo at that point in trying to figure out, you\nknow, whether Mr. Dershowitz was involved in sexually\nabusing not only Virginia Roberts, but in other girls,\nthen you go down to the next level, next layer of the\ncriminal conspiracy. Epstein is at the top, so you go\nto the next layer. These are, you know, basically the\nwomen who, from what I could gather, were older than the\nage that Epstein wanted to sexually abuse. I think\nthese were 22, 23-year-old girls, so they had, you know,\nessentially aged out of being his sexual abuse victims,\nbut they continued to -- what they would do is collect\ngirls for him under the age of 18, that I guess was in\nhis target range.\n\nAnd so what -- so the next person I wanted to\ntalk to, you know, and get information from was Sarah\nKellen. Sarah Kellen is on a lot of these flight logs\nwith, you know, these girls that -- or women and with\nEpstein and others, and so I wanted to talk to Sarah\n\nKellen.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021896",
