I mean, you've got the budget\nhawks and then you've got the defense hawks within the same party.\nAnd so I think there is no consensus on a role in the world.\"\n\nIn some ways, the first part of his tenure was easier. During the Bush\nyears, money was never an issue. By contrast, Obama faced a harsh\neconomic reality, and Gates tried to get in front of the issue by\nshrinking the Pentagon budget.
