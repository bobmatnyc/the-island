  "text": "launched into a wide-ranging lecture on global strategy. Trump was soon, and obviously,\ndistracted, and as the lecture continued he began sulking.\n\n“That guy bores the shit out of me,” announced Trump after McMaster left the room.\nBut Kushner pushed him to take another meeting with McMaster, who the next day\nshowed up without his uniform and in a baggy suit.\n\n“He looks like a beer salesman,” Trump said, announcing that he would hire McMaster\nbut didn’t want to have another meeting with him.\n\nShortly after his appointment, McMaster appeared on Morning Joe. Trump saw the\nshow and noted admiringly, “The guy sure gets good press.”\n\nThe president decided he had made a good hire.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nBy midmorning on April 4, a full briefing had been assembled at the White House for the\npresident about the chemical attacks. Along with his daughter and Powell, most members\nof the president’s inner national security circle saw the bombing of Khan Sheikhoun as a\nstraightforward opportunity to register an absolute moral objection. The circumstance was\nunequivocal: Bashar al-Assad’s government, once again defying international law, had\nused chemical weapons. There was video documenting the attack and substantial\nagreement among intelligence agencies about Assad’s responsibility. The politics were\nright: Barack Obama failed to act when confronted with a Syrian chemical attack, and now\nTrump could. The downside was small; it would be a contained response. And it had the\nadded advantage of seeming to stand up to the Russians, Assad’s effective partners in\nSyria, which would score a political point at home.\n\nBannon, at perhaps his lowest moment of influence in the White House—many still\nfelt that his departure was imminent—was the only voice arguing against a military\nresponse. It was a purist’s rationale: keep the United States out of intractable problems,\nand certainly don’t increase our involvement in them. He was holding the line against the\nrising business-as-usual faction, making decisions based on the same set of assumptions,\nBannon believed, that had resulted in the Middle East quagmire. It was time to break the\nstandard-response pattern of behavior, represented by the Jarvanka-Powell-Cohn-\nMcMaster alliance. Forget normal—in fact, to Bannon, normal was precisely the problem.\n\nThe president had already agreed to McMaster’s demand that Bannon be removed from\nthe National Security Council, though the change wouldn’t be announced until the\nfollowing day. But Trump was also drawn to Bannon’s strategic view: Why do anything, if\nyou don’t have to? Or, why would you do something that doesn’t actually get you\nanything? Since taking office, the president had been developing an intuitive national\nsecurity view: keep as many despots who might otherwise screw you as happy as possible.\nA self-styled strongman, he was also a fundamental appeaser. In this instance, then, why\ncross the Russians?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020026",
