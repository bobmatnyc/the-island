  "text": "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians\n\nalternative perspectives are permitted on a carefully\nrationed basis. But dissenting opinions are invari-\n\nably subjected to relentless attack and ridicule, and\nthe dissidents themselves face a form of character\nassassination in which their views are twisted to make\nthem appear foolish, extreme, unpatriotic, or immoral.\n\nChristopher Walker, a vice president at the National\nEndowment for Democracy who has written exten-\nsively on modern authoritarianism, believes that con-\ntrol of information is the most important achievement\nof today’s generation of autocrats:\n\n| think modern authoritarians have been\nadept at adjusting to the new environment.\nThey recognize that trying to control the\nwealth of information out there is impossi-\nble, and therefore they don't try. There are\n\na number of countries which have found\neffective ways to incorporate entertainment\nand culture into their media offerings while\nkeeping domination over the political sphere.\nThey have thus defied the assumptions we\nheld 20 years ago when the internet was\nemerging. The conventional wisdom then\nwas that the internet guaranteed media\ndiversity, and there is no way regimes could\nkeep the genie in the bottle. In fact, in many\ncountries authoritarians have kept the genie\nin the bottle through managing the political\nnarrative and denying people access to key\ninformation.’*\n\nWalker's comments certainly apply to conditions in Rus-\nsia. During the communist period, Soviet propaganda\nwas meant to justify both state socialism and Russia's\nisolation from the global economic system and Western\nculture. In Russia, China, and elsewhere, it is now pos-\nsible for citizens to enjoy the latest international music,\nfashion, and entertainment while hating the liberal\nvalues that are systematically disparaged in the media.\n\nWhat is tragic about all this is that Russians already\ncame through a decades-long period of propaganda\nin which reality was twisted and lies circulated as a\nconscious matter of national policy. Orwell and other\nfoes of totalitarian rule sought to describe the danger\nthat propaganda and censorship posed to knowl-\nedge, reality, and independent thought. But instead of\nthings getting better after the demise of totalitarian-\nism, a newer and in some ways more insidious form of\ninformation control has emerged, one which does not\nso much try to persuade people that the government\n\nline is the only correct line, but that facts do not exist\nas such and nothing can be believed.\n\nChina: 21st-century censorship\n\nThe Chinese model of information control differs in\ncrucial ways from the propaganda methods favored by\nRussia. Especially in its policies towards the internet,\nChina focuses its energies on preventing access to in-\nformation or news on a wide and perpetually evolving\nrange of subjects that the ruling Chinese Communist\nParty (CCP) regards as sensitive.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping, who took power in late 2012, the\ngovernment has been much more open in arguing for\nthe right of the political leadership to censor internet\ncontent. He has, in fact, launched a campaign de-\nsigned to radically redraw the global rules on internet\nfreedom so as to enshrine the concept of “internet\nsovereignty,” according to which individual countries\nwould “independently choose their own path of cyber\ndevelopment” and “model of cyber regulation.\"\n\nIn late 2015, Xi also made the baffling statement,\n“Freedom is what order is meant for, and order is\n\nthe guarantee of freedom.\"!* Over the next several\nmonths, regulators moved to enforce the president's\nvision for tighter CCP control over all news media and\nimposed rules that further restricted the production\nof independent news content by online outlets.!”\n\nPerhaps most important have been the threats to the\nlivelihood and personal liberty of bloggers and online\ncommentators. In recent years, the state has pursued\na campaign of arrest, prosecution, and public humil-\niation directed against well-known microbloggers\nand other media personalities, including a series of\ntelevised “confessions.” The machinery of repression\nwas directed against those who had used their plat-\nforms to criticize the leadership or its policies, and to\na disturbing extent, the effort has been successful in\nsilencing such criticism.\n\nAmong other recent developments in the CCP’s cen-\nsorship drive:\n\n¢ The authorities have punished journalists\nfor publishing news about the economy that\nhighlighted negative trends, and issued media\ndirectives aimed at shaping coverage of econo-\nmy-related topics. The economy was the second\nmost censored topic in China in 2015, a year\nthat featured a dramatic stock-market crash and\nslowing economic growth.!®\n\n18\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019252",
