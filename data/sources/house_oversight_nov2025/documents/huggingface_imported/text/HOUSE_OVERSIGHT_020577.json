In some cases, they may even be inadvertently advancing China’s goals for military\ntechnological superiority. American technology CEOs, including those from Google, Apple, and Cisco, are\nprominent attendees at the World Internet Conference. At one installment of the conference, a Chinese\nantiterrorism expert argued that Beijing should increase its pressure on foreign internet companies such\nas Twitter, which he argued should be punished for tweets that “defame the party, Chinese leaders, and\nrelated national strategies.” Facebook has been notably solicitous of the Chinese government in an effort\nto enter the Chinese market, reportedly developing a tool that could be used by a third party to censor\ncontent. Despite being blocked in China, Facebook nonetheless generates significant advertising revenues\nfrom Chinese companies seeking to reach foreign consumers. As it seeks to reenter the Chinese market,\nGoogle’s willingness to facilitate that country’s national artificial intelligence priorities stand in contrast\nto its decision to end limited Al cooperation with the US Department of Defense. In June 2018, Tsinghua\nannounced that Google’s Al chief would serve as an adviser to that university’s new center for artificial\nintelligence research. The company is already involved in research at Peking University and the University\nof Science and Technology of China, among others. Artificial intelligence is a declared strategic priority\nfor the Chinese government with significant military implications. The Chinese government is actively\ncoordinating the efforts of not just its universities, but also nominally private companies such as Baidu.\nCommenting on Google’s Al China Center, at which several hundred engineers are employed, former deputy\ndefense secretary Bob Work has stated, “anything that’s going on in that center is going to be used” by\nthe Chinese military. In the summer of 2018, it was reported that Google was considering reentering the\nChinese market with a censored search engine, but Chinese government officials have discounted the\nprospect and many of Google’s own employees have expressed opposition.\n\nChina also seeks to enlist foreign corporations to reinforce its so-called “core interests” in ways that\nhave influenced what they feel comfortable saying even outside of China. In early 2018, for example,\nforeign companies, particularly in the travel industry, were targeted for listing Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau,\nand Tibet as separate entities on their websites rather than as sovereign parts of China. The Civil Aviation\nAdministration of China sent letters to international airlines demanding that any references to these\ndestinations except as part of China be removed from their materials and websites. In May, the Trump\nadministration declared the Chinese government’s order to airlines to be “Orwellian nonsense and part\nof a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens\nand private companies” with which they might not necessarily agree. At the direction of the American\ngovernment, the airlines initially and collectively declined to follow Beijing’s orders, as the US government\nconsidered the issue a diplomatic matter to be resolved between governments. However, when China\ndeclined to negotiate with the US government over the issue, by July the airlines partially met Beijing’s\ndemands by referring only to cities.\n\nTargeting foreign companies’ speech extends beyond Taiwan to China’s fraught relationship with its\nethnic minorities. At Marriott, an employee responsible for managing the company’s social media accounts\nunwittingly liked a tweet by a pro-Tibet group and was fired as a result of the backlash. The company’s\nwebsite and app were blocked in China for one week, at unknown financial cost. Daimler, the German\ncar manufacturer, was similarly forced to apologize for posting a reference to the Dalai Lama, the exiled\nTibetan spiritual leader, on social media. In the latter two cases, the companies were targeted even though\nthe social services on which they were posting were blocked inside China.
