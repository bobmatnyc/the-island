However, we think most\nTripAdvisor visitors (399mn average monthly unique visitors in 2017 and 148mn\naverage monthly hotel shoppers) still view the site as a review/research portal, and\nchanging customer behavior will be quite difficult, particularly as we do not think\nTripAdvisor has clarified its value proposition for shoppers.\n\nWhile we think that TripAdvisor's elevated marketing spend in 2017 will drive a rebound\nin traffic, we anticipate a poor ROI. Marketing expense continues to ramp as Instant\nBook rolls out, though traffic growth slows, implying more costly traffic acquisition. In\n40’16, Sales & Marketing as a % of sales increased to 52.8% vs. 45.6% in 4Q’15, and\nwe think TripAdvisor essentially bought desktop Hotel Shopper traffic, though likely at\npoor ROI. However, higher marketing spend in 2017 does not yet include potential for a\nlikely return to expensive brand ad campaigns. In our brand ad spend scenario analysis,\nwe expect still more downside to estimates (see Taking a look at TripAdvisor’s potential\n\nbrand ad spend).\n\nThe company is encouraged by Revenue per Hotel Shopper growth continuing to\nimprove from down 21% y/y in 1Q. We expect growth continues its improvement trend\nin 2017. However, if monetization trends decelerate, earnings downside could be\nsignificant. We think it will be difficult for TripAdvisor's Hotel revenue to return to\ngrowth next year, let alone double-digit y/y growth, given the mobile monetization\nheadwinds. However, if the company invests heavily in traffic acquisition, particularly on\nhigher monetizing desktop, revenue and traffic growth may reaccelerate meaningfully in\n2017, though with ongoing pressure on margins.\n\nChart 15: Quarterly revenue and Sales & Marketing per Hotel Shopper y/y growth\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n-10%\n-20%\n-30%\n\n© O_O ge Gh Ge gh Go ee &  _& &\nFPP SF PPP” FM wri gh gh g\n\nYNY Growth\n\n—— Revenue per Hotel Shopper = =—-===S&M per Hotel Shopper\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, company report\n\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Update on ad spend targets, 2017 guidance\n\nTRIP’s outlook for 2017 is based on “prioritizing revenue growth as opposed to profit\ngrowth,” which implies far lower marketing return expectations. However, TRIP notes\nthis expectation for marketing spend does not include potential for a return to brand\nmarketing, which could be an incremental $50-70mn headwind in ’17, in our view.\n\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n\n¢ Marketing spend: TripAdvisor has prioritized revenue growth at the expense of\nearnings, implying poor marketing ROI. The biggest issue facing TripAdvisor is if it\ndecides to pursue an expensive brand/TV marketing campaign which would further\ndrive further earnings downside.\n\nBankofAmerica <2 ; ;\nMerrill Lynch Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 37\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014923",
