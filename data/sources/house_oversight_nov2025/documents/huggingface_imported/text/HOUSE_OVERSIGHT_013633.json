This is the spirit of percolation.\nComputer simulations of percolating blazes generate a multiplicity of life times of\nforest fires near the singularity that represents the transition to a global\nconflagration.\n\nMentioned previously is Rudolf Otto’s 1917 book about the characteristics of\nreligious experience, Das Heilige, The Sacred, which described phases in the\ndiscontinuous transition from everyday life to the wholly other (ganz andere) reality\n\nof the world of the sacred. They include intense\n\nrofane. In his 1958\n\nbook, Patterns in Comparative Religions, this well-known historian of religion called\n\nthe revelatory occurrence of sacred reality an hierophany. Eliade’s classic work,\nThe Sacred and the Profane, contrasts the homogenous, spiritually formless and\nrelative world of the profane with the results of passage through spatial and\ntemporal singularities to a place and time that are not of this world.\n\nPoincaré said that the brain did not know of absolute space, but rather\nestablished a model of it through internal reconstructions of sequential sensory\nexperiences that_accompanied our exploratory movements. A\n\nworld. It was Poincare’s habit to topologize the dynamics of motion in mathematical\n\nproblems that lacked analytic solutions. In this way, simple algebraic operations\nreplace some of the insoluble problems of the calculus. Eliade’s sacred space\n\ndefining singularity in the plane that breaks profane homogeneousness, a center\n\npoint that is no longer a circle, can be viewed also as Poincaré’s topological center.\n\nreal physical movements around such singular fixed points. The operational object\n\ncalled groups defines this kind of algebraic, mathematical structure and motion.\n133\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013633",
