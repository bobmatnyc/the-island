  "text": "such regulation is “killing frontier innovation.”\nIndeed, some have put forth the prevalence of\npoor government policies as one of the theories to\nexplain the slow pace of this recovery.\n\nPoor Policies in Washington\n\nOne of the theories that has been getting more\ntraction recently attributes the slower recovery\n\nto poor policies enacted in Washington. In a June\n2016 article about the US economy, Gregory\nMankiw, professor at Harvard University and\nformer chair of the Council of Economic Advisers\nfor President George W. Bush, highlighted “policy\nmissteps,” ** including misguided fiscal policy, as\n\na possible contributor to the slow pace of growth\nsince the global financial crisis.\n\nOne unusual feature of this recovery has, in\nfact, been a contractionary fiscal policy. We have\nderived an approximate historical measure of\nfiscal policy changes by estimating changes in the\ncyclically adjusted federal budget as a percentage\nof GDP. We note that, by this measure, as far back\nas 1890, fiscal policy has been expansionary in all\nbut three recoveries following a recession—with\nthe fiscal policy in the current recovery being the\nmost contractionary, as shown in Exhibit 16. In\nthis recovery, the budget deficit as a share of GDP\nwas reduced by 1.0% a year, compared to an\naverage widening of the budget deficit by 1.3% a\nyear in all other recoveries after severe recessions.\nThe average increase in the size of the budget\n\nTwo books published in 2016 and written by Swedes born in the early\n1970s highlight the conflicting perspectives on productivity.\n\nJohan Norberg’s Progress cover used with permission of Johan Norberg\nand Oneworld Publications.

A swing of 1.8 percentage points\nwould have had a material impact on the pace of\nthis recovery.\n\nProfessor Alan Blinder of Princeton University\nand former vice chair at the Federal Reserve echoed\nthe sentiment by stating that partisan politics have\nprevented progress in dealing with important\neconomic issues.** Shambaugh has outlined various\nmeasures, such as infrastructure spending proposed\nby President Obama in his fiscal year 2017 budget,\nthat would positively impact productivity and labor\nforce participation.’ The budget was not approved.\nSummers has similarly called for expansionary fiscal\npolicy through infrastructure spending, but such\npolicies have not been pursued.**\n\nIncreased regulation has also been blamed\nfor some of the slow pace of this recovery. A\nSeptember 2016 working paper by Martin\nNeil Baily and Nicholas Montalbano of the\nBrookings Institution on the slow growth of US\nproductivity shows that while productivity in the\nmost productive firms is growing rapidly, their\nbest practices are not spreading to the rest of the\nplayers in a given industry.*” Exhibit 17 shows the\nwidening gap between the productivity growth\nrates of firms at the frontier of innovation and\n\n18 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014551",
