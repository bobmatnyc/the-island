  "text": "missed those crucial, central AT&T nodes, would still reduce American military\ncommunications to a bunch of hissing, empty phones. “Our communications were so\nvulnerable,” Baran said, “that each missile base commander would face the dilemma\nof either doing nothing in the event of a physical attack, or taking action that would\nmean an all out irrevocable war.” You could, uneasily, picture the moment of\ndecision: Some Colonel alone in his bomb-laden plane over Europe or deep in some\ncornfield missile silo wondering “Launch or not?”. This was a horrifying possibility.\nBaran began to ask: Was there some other way to send a counter-strike signal?\nThere was a sense of life-saving preciousness in such a setting about connectivity\nitself. To hold it, manage it, protect and control it - in the face of the extreme\npressures of a nuclear balance, such connection marked the difference between\nsafety and catastrophe.\n\n2.\n\nYou can, at the heart of many revolutions, find the warm hints of human psychology\npressing out. This is the roiling, unscratchable instinct for change that marks a really\nrevolutionary temperament - and that often is the only sort of personality that can\nimagine and then deliver a solution to impossible problems. Conservatives like\nthings as they are, even if “as they are” is sometimes broken or dysfunctional or\ndangerous. Revolutionaries are different. They don’t seem to choose their role. They\nhave a vision for how the world ought to be, a vibrating and instinctive picture of\npower, and driven by passion or anger or faith or some wild genius, they chase that\nvision relentlessly, even into madness. If they are lucky, however, they live in an age\nwhere their crazy hopes catch onto some larger human hunger. Khomeini worried\nthat the Shah would never fall. Lenin was preparing to abandon revolutionary\npolitics in 1916. Jobs was told the iPhone could never be built as he wished. Then, in\nan instant, revolution.\n\nWe might ask: What set Martin Luther on his revolutionary course to demand\ninstant access to God? Luther would tell you that his first inspiration had come to\nhim one night in the summer of 1505, while he was walking home in a\nthunderstorm, when a lightning bolt landed a foot or two away.!°° Luther had been\nstruggling for years with an inner battle, with a tension between his faith and what\nit demanded of him. Then, when that lightning cracked free from the storm, a\nsensation of total terror was replaced by a new feeling. The nearness and power of\nGod snapped past him in that moment. It clarified everything. He dropped his law\nstudies the next day and within a year he was an Augustinian monk, preaching -\noften hundreds of sermons a year, ever angrier, ever clearer — about the closeness of\nGod, the real, tangible, bolt-from-the-blue passage of faith to faith. He was totally,\ncompletely converted.\n\n106 Luther would tell you: Albert Beutel “Luther’s Life” in Ed. Donald K. McKim, The\nCambridge Companion to Martin Luther (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n2003) 4\n\n79\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018311",
