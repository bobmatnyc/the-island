  "text": "Morality Games 311\n\nPsychologists and economists sometimes take this “norm” as given, without asking\nwhere it comes from, and a naive reading of Trivers would lead one to think that we\nshould be sensitive to the magnitude of the initial favor and whether it is\nmanipulative.\n\nHowever, according to the above model, reciprocity is the Nash equilibrium,\neven if the favors are not evenly matched or manipulative, since, in equilibrium, we\nare neither sensitive to such quantitative distinctions nor to whether the initial reci-\nprocity was manipulative, unless these facts are commonly known.\n\nSelf-Image Concerns. People sometimes play mental tricks in order to appear to\nthemselves as pro-social. For example, in an experiment, subjects will voluntarily take\non a boring task to save another subject from doing it, but if given the option of pri-\nvately flipping a coin to determine who gets the task, they often flip—and flip, and flip\nagain—until the “coin” assigns the task to the other subject (Batson, Kobrynowicz,\nDinnerstein, Kampf, & Wilson, 1997). Why would we be able to fool ourselves and\nnot, say, recognize that we are gaming the coin flip? Why do we care what we think\nof ourselves at all? Are there any constraints on how we will deceive ourselves?\nSuch self-image considerations can be explained by noting that our self-image can\nact as a simple proxy, albeit an imperfect one, for what others think of us, and also that\nwe are more convincing to others when we believe something ourselves (Kurzban,\n2012; Trivers, 2011). This explanation suggests that the ways we deceive ourselves\ncorrespond to quirks described throughout this section—for example, we will absolve\nourselves of remaining strategically ignorant even when it is easy not to, or be con-\nvinced that we have done good by voting, even if we cannot swing an election.\n\nFraming Effects. Whether we contribute is highly dependent on the details of the\nexperiment, such as the choice set (List, 2007) and the labels for the different\nchoices (Ross & Ward, 1996; Roth, 1995). Such findings are often taken as evidence\nthat social preferences cannot be properly measured in the lab (Levitt & List, 2007).\n\nWe believe a more fruitful interpretation is simply that the frame influences\nwhether the laboratory experiment “turns on” our pro-social preferences, perhaps\nby simulating a situation where cooperation is expected (Levitt & List, 2007).\n\nOne-Shot Anonymous Giving: We give in anonymous, one-shot settings, such as\ndictator games. We also sacrifice for others in the real world when there is no chance\nof reciprocation: Heroes jump on grenades to save their fellow soldiers or block the\ndoor to a classroom with their bodies to prevent a school shooter from entering\n(Rand & Epstein, 2014). This is often seen as evidence for a role of group selection\n(Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003).\n\nHowever, an alternate explanation is that we do not consider the likelihood of\nreciprocation (Hoffman et al., 2015), as described above. To explain the laboratory\nevidence, there are two more possibilities. First, subjects may believe there is some\nchance their identity will be revealed and feel the costs of being revealed as selfish\nare greater than the gains from the experiment (Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, &\nTooby, 2011). Second, we again emphasize that learned or evolved preferences and\nideologies are expected to be applied even in novel settings to which they are not\noptimized.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015523",
