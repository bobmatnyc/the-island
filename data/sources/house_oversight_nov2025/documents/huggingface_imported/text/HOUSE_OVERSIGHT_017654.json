  "text": "Page 19 of 78\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *887\n\nconcerning ... [a] plea.\" !°7 But this brief mention in the rule is inferior to my specific proposal for several reasons. First, Rule\n11 is the \"script\" when federal judges accept guilty pleas. Victims should be directly included here so that judges do not\ninadvertently overlook victims’ rights. Second, stating only that victims may be \"reasonably heard\" regarding a plea, without\nexplaining how that will occur, invites litigation and uncertainty. For example, is a victim reasonably heard when allowed to be\nheard only through written submission? !°° Is a victim treated \"fairly\" if the court is required to address the defendant in open\ncourt but not to address the victim? If the court does not address the victim, when should the victim try to interrupt the\nproceedings to be heard? Should the victim's views enter into the court's calculation about whether to accept the plea? All of\nthese questions are answered in a simple and straightforward way by my proposal - a proposal which the Advisory Committee\nshould adopt.\n\nRule 11(c)(1) - Prosecution To Consider Victims’ Views on Pleas The Proposals:\n\nI proposed that the prosecution should be required to consider victims' views in developing any proposed plea arrangement as\nfollows:\n\n(1) In General. An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may\ndiscuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. The attorney for the government shall\nmake reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider the victims’ views about, any proposed plea negotiations. If\nthe defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, [*888] the plea\nagreement may specify that an attorney for the government will ... [listing various options]. !°?\n\nThe Advisory Committee did not recommend any change. °°\n\nDiscussion:\n\nMy proposed change required prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify victims about pleas and to consider the victims’\nviews regarding pleas. This requirement was taken almost verbatim from the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance, which already directs prosecutors to \"make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider\nvictims' views about, prospective plea negotiations.\" !©! According to the Department of Justice, \"twenty-nine states [already]\n\nrequire prosecutors to \"consult with’ or \"obtain the views of victims at the plea agreement stage.\" 1°\n\n157 Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60(a)(3), at 15-16.\n\n158 Compare United States v. Degenhardt, 405 F. Supp. 2d 1341, 1345-46 (D. Utah 2005) (finding that a victim must be heard orally at\nsentencing), and United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 333 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting in dicta that § 3771(a)(4) \"requires the victim to\nbe given an opportunity actually to be “heard! rather than afforded some alternate means of communicating her views\") (emphasis in\noriginal), with United States v. Marcello, 370 F. Supp. 2d 745, 749 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (holding that \"in detention hearings, the victim's right to\nbe reasonably heard does not mandate oral statements, particularly when the [victim] has no personal knowledge of the guilt of the\ndefendant(s) and offers an opinion only on a matter that is not in dispute\").\n\n159 Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 868.\n\n160 Proposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n\n161 U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office for Victims of Crime, Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance 30 (2005) (defining\nwhat can be considered in determining whether notice is reasonable in a particular case) [hereinafter Dep't of Justice, Attorney General\nGuidelines]; see also U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office for Victims of Crime, New Directions from the Field: Victims' Rights and Services for the\n21st Century 87 (1997) (\"Prosecutors should make every effort ... to consult with the victim on the terms of any negotiated plea ... .\")\n[hereinafter Dep't of Justice, New Directions from the Field].\n\n162 Dep't of Justice, New Directions from the Field, supra note 161, at 75 (quoting National Victims' Center, 1996 Victim's Rights\nSourcebook: A Compilation of Victim's Rights Laws, Arlington, VA: National Victim Center, 1997 § 5).\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017654",
