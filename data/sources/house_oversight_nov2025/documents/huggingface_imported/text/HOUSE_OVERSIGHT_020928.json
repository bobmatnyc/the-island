Note that entitlement spending includes federal government expenditures on Social\nSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid. Data in our chart is based on CBO’s ‘alternative fiscal scenario’ forecast, which assumes a continuation of today’s underlying\nfiscal policy. Note that CBO also maintains an ‘extended-baseline’ scenario, which adheres closely to current law. The alternative fiscal scenario deviates from\n\nCBO’s baseline because it incorporates some policy changes that are widely expected to occur (such as extending the 2001-2003 tax cuts rather than letting them\nexpire as scheduled by current law and adjusting physician payment rates to be in line with the Medicare economic index rather than at lower scheduled rates) and\n\nKP that policymakers have regularly made in the past.\n\n(@E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | Income Statement Drilldown 174\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020928",
