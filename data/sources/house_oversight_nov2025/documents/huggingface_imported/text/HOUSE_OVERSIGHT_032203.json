And\nas that superstructure became too unwieldy, an emperor like the gruff\nsoldier Diocletian could allow for the division of the empire itself\ninto several administrative parts, thus furthering its life span.\nAmerica, for its part, is unique in its division of federal, state and\nlocal power over a vast continental landscape, allowing for the full\nexpression of its boisterous democracy. Say what you will about the\ndeficiencies of the United States and particularly those of Rome, but\nthey both indicate a very difficult truth central to the outcome of the\nArab Spring: it is not about the expressions of freedom in Tahrir\nSquare so much as it is about the building of legitimate institutions to\nreplace illegitimate ones. And because institutions are hierarchical—\nand social media like Twitterand Facebookdismantle existing\nhierarchies—revolutions enabled by new technology do not\nnecessarily lead to the building of governing organizations. Criticism\nis not enough, someone must wield power; hopefully in a way less\ncoercive than before.\n\nMeanwhile, the Arab Spring has raised the pressure on autocrats the\nworld over to truly be good—or at least better. Though, even if they\nare, they can never ultimately get it right, as demonstrated by Mill’s\nexample of Marcus Aurelius.\n\nRobert D. Kaplan is a foreign correspondent for The Atlantic, a\nsenior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in\nWashington and a member of the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board.\nHis most recent book is Monsoon: The Indian Ocean and the Future\nof American Power (Random House, 2010).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032203",
