Sunday/ Monday sanction rhetoric from ranging from g8 expulsion to Iran-style bank embargo is\nraised a notch. Russia follows with more threats of counter-sanctions. My sense is the Obama 5m of 696m SPR release is to show\nMerkel and co he will step in. He needs to because there are 8 small European and Baltic countries that rec 70%+ of their gas from\nRussia. Germany gets 30%.\n\nCross asset correlations outside of the US are increasing past few days - eg copper and the Turkish lira hourly charts are on top of each\nother past 4 days. I'm worried there is a 30-40pct(?) chance of a hard risk off move in markets in first half of next week - more focused\non European equities, copper, EM FX (Turkey, ZAR, Ruble etc) than SPX. In that scenario oil is way up.\n\nExchange WTI calls - there are 2 options (as of 3pm est):\n\n5day expiry 17march 2014 underlying clj4 97.92\n\nand\n\n35d expiry 16april2014 underlying clk4 97.59\n\n** The 5 day options are a bit short - one possibility is sell a 3usd out of the money put (95.5 strike) for 20cents and buy a 2usd OTM\n100 call for 25. Net pay 5cents. But 5d is a bit short for me.\n\n**For 35d expiry You could look at selling 91.50 (6usd OTM put) for 56cents and buying 103c (5.5usd OTM) for 58cents or the 102c\n(4.5usd OTM) for 76cents.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022260",
