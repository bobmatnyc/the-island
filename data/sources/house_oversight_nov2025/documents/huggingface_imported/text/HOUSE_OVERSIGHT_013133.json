The conventional stage has to do with the raw,\nuncontrolled capability for such simulation; and the post-conventional stage corresponds to its\ncontextual, goal-oriented control. But controlling empathy, clearly, requires subtle management\nof various uncertain contextual factors, which is exactly what uncertain logical inference is\ngood at — so, in an AGI system combining an uncertain inference component with a simulative\ncomponent, it is the inference component that would enable the nuanced control of empathy\nallowing the ascent to Gilligan’s post-conventional stage.\n\nIn our integrative perspective, in the context of an AGI system integrating inference and\nsimulation components, we suggest that the ascent from the pre-ethical to the conventional\nstage may be carried out largely via independent activity of these two components. Empathy\nis needed, and reasoning about fairness and rights are needed, but the two need not intimately\nand sensitively intersect — though they must of course intersect to some extent.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013133",
