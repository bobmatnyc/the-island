  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nChurch of the Creation”. He had been denied admission to the Illinois Bar because of his neo-\nNazi views.\n\nHale was invited to appear on the Today Show to be interviewed by Katie Couric. I was asked to\nexplain why I would even consider representing such a horrible racist and anti-Semite. Couric\nbegan by asking Hale to describe his views “in a nutshell.” He went on about how non-\nEuropeans—by which he means Blacks and Jews—were destroying the “white race” and how he\nwas going to change that if he were admitted to the bar.\n\nCouric then asked me why I believed a man with Hale’s views should be allowed to become a\nlawyer.\n\nKC: Mr. Hale should be allowed to practice law...why?\n\nAD: Well first of all I am not a supporter of Mr. Hale. You asked about his views in a\nnutshell. That’s where his views belong, in a nutshell. They are despicable, revolting\nviews. But what I’m concerned about is the precedential effect of giving character\ncommittees the right to determine who shall and who shall not have the right to practice\nlaw on the basis of ideology and belief. Remember character committees were invented to\noriginally keep out Blacks, Jews, gays, women, leftists...I just don’t want to see a\nresurrection of character committees probing into the ideology of people like Mr. Hale. If\nI take his case, and he’s asked me to represent him, I told him this and he knows this. All\nthe fees will be contributed to anti-racist organizations which will fight the ideology of\nbigots like him. I hope the American public listening to him would reject his ideas in the\nmarketplace but not through censorship of the kind that the character committee is trying\nto practice.\n\nKC: But simply espousing these views, couldn’t that lead to violence, by other\nindividuals?\n\nAD: Well there is no question how our Constitution strikes that balance. Reading the\nwork of Marx can lead to incitement. Reading the Bible can lead to incitement. But we\ndon’t draw the line at the espousal of views. We draw it at incitement or violence itself\nand we don’t want to have a different standard for racists than we do for other people.\n\nCouric then turned back to Hale:\n\nKC: Ok, you talk about your enemies, Mr. Hale, and among them are Jews. Do you see\nthe irony that you hate Jews and yet you are calling on Mr. Dershowitz to help you?\n\nMH: Well the fact of the matter if having a “Dershowitz” in this equation has brought our\nchurch an incredible amount of publicity and as a minister in my church, it is my obligation\nto bring about as much publicity as possible.\n\n142\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017229",
