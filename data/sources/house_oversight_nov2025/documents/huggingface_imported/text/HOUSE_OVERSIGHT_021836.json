I just want to make sure you get an\nopportunity to ask as many questions as you want so.\n\nQ. Okay. And I appreciate that, but the court\nreporter can't take down both of us at once. So we just\nneed to speak one at a time, but I appreciate that.\n\nA. Good.\n\nQ. I believe the last question I was asking you\nabout whether the scope of the investigation, what\nreasonably required of an attorney varies depending upon\nthe nature of the allegations being made. I think you\nsaid, yes; is that right?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. And could you explain how, what in your\nunderstanding of how --\n\nA. Sure. I mean, obviously, they are going to\nbe some cases that are very complicated factually. More\ninvestigation would be appropriate there. There can be\nsome situations that very simple factually, less\ninvestigation would be factually necessary there. Same\npoints about legal issues, too, some cases are complex\nlegally, some cases are simple legally.\n\nThe more legal investigation would be\nrequired for the more complex cases.\nMR.
