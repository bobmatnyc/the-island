  "text": "Did Snowden Act Alone? | 149\n\nother whistle-blowers who uncovered what they considered gov-\nernment malfeasance by virtue of their jobs, Snowden, by his own\nadmission, took a new job in 2013 specifically to get access to the SCI\nfiles concerning NSA sources that he stole from the Threat Opera-\ntions Center. Switching jobs in order to widen one’s access to state\nsecrets is an activity usually associated with penetration agents, not\nwhistle-blowers. While the technical distinction between a whistle-\nblower and a spy may still serve the media in the case of Snowden,\nit does not help in solving the counterintelligence conundrum. A\ncomplex theft of state secrets had been successfully carried out in\na supposedly secure site. The only known witness, Snowden, had\nescaped to Russia, where he could be of no help in reconstructing the\ncrime for American intelligence agencies. The stolen data was kept\nin the equivalent of sealed “vaults”—actually computer drives that\nwere not connected to the NSA network. If ever there was a locked-\nroom mystery, this was it.\n\nAccording to the FBI investigation, Snowden pierced these barri-\ners by using passwords that belonged to other people and using cre-\n\n© dentials that allowed him to masquerade as a system administrator. ©\nIt was a feat that must have required meticulous planning.\n\nTo address such a mystery, a counterintelligence investigation\nstarts with a tabula rasa, stripping away all the previous assump-\ntions, including that Snowden was the lone perpetrator. It builds\nalternative scenarios to test against the known facts. To be sure, sce-\nnario building differs from that of a conventional forensic investiga-\ntion aimed at finding pieces of evidence that can be used to persuade\na jury in a courtroom. Unlike a judicial investigation concerned with\nguilt and innocence, scenario building looks to develop a story that\nis, concurrently, intrinsically consistent and humanly plausible, and\nin the process it also identifies and explores the possible holes in the\ncase.\n\n“Scenarios deal with two worlds: the world of facts and the world\nof perceptions. They explore for facts but they aim at perceptions\ninside the heads of decision makers. Their purpose is to gather and\ntransform information of strategic significance into fresh percep-\ntions,” wrote Pierre Wack in the Harvard Business Review in 1985.\nSuch scenarios must aim at constituting a limited set of mutually\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 149 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019637",
