Rev. 835, *854\n\nsuch conclusion would be contrary to the plain language of the CVRA. |!° To avoid possible confusion, the rules should be\nclear on this point.\n\nAn additional reason for integrating victims into the federal rules is that Congress seemingly expects this to happen. Congress\nadopted the CVRA with the express goal of making the new law \"a formula [*855] for success\" and a \"model for our States.\"\n111 Congress clearly wants the new law aggressively implemented, thereby avoiding the need for further legislative action or\neven, possibly, a federal constitutional amendment. Congress is watching to see whether the Judiciary (and the Executive) will\nfully and fairly implement this new Act. As Senator Leahy warned, \"Passage of this bill will necessitate careful oversight of its\nimplementation by Congress.\" 1!\n\nConstruing the CVRA to require changes is also appropriate because the Act is remedial legislation. As the Supreme Court has\ninstructed, \"When Congress uses broad generalized language in a remedial statute, and that language is not contravened by\nauthoritative legislative history, a court should interpret the provision generously so as to effectuate the important congressional\ngoals.\" !!3 The congressional sponsors described the victims’ rights in the CVRA as \"broad rights,\" !!4 the significance of\nwhich should not \"be whittled down or marginalized by the courts or the executive branch. This legislation is meant to correct,\nnot continue, the legacy of the poor treatment of crime victims in the criminal process.\" !!>\n\nA final reason for amending the rules is that crime victims’ groups are looking for the effective implementation of the CVRA.\nThey are urging that the federal rules be comprehensively amended to reflect victims’ rights; indeed, they have even suggested\nthat Congress should directly amend the federal rules to include victims’ rights. !!© The Judiciary would be well advised not to\nignore these lobbying efforts. Victims have proven very effective at advancing legislation in Congress, particularly where they\nhave legitimate grievances about how they have been treated. !!7\n\nMoreover, allowing the initiative for drafting of rules to pass from the Judiciary to Congress is not ideal. The Advisory\nCommittee on Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure includes many skilled [*856] members with considerable experience in\ndrafting rules. The Committee is well aware of the CVRA. Shortly after the passage of the CVRA, the Committee withdrew a\n\n118\n\nmodest victim amendment it was proposing in anticipation of the need to make more extensive changes, and is already\n\nworking on proposed amendments to the rules. |!° It is preferable to have victims integrated into the federal rules through\ncareful drafting by the Committee rather than by the potentially blunderbuss approach of direct congressional action.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be comprehensively amended to recognize the interests\nof crime victims and thereby to allow victims to be full participants in the criminal process.\n\nIV. Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure To Implement the CVRA\n\nWith the goal of effectively implementing the CVRA firmly in mind, the remainder of this Article proposes twenty-eight\nspecific rule changes for consideration by the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules.
