  "text": "Edwards adv. Epstein\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nSecond Renewed Motion for Leave to Assert Claim for Punitive Damages\n\nrecord evidence. From the beginning, Edwards diligently represented three victims of sexual\nassaults perpetrated by Epstein. As explained in detail below, each and every one of Edwards’s\nlitigation decisions was grounded in proper litigation judgment about the need to pursue effective\ndiscovery against Epstein, particularly in the face of Epstein’s stonewalling tactics. Edwards’s\nsuccessful representation finally forced Epstein to settle and pay appropriate damages. Effective\nand proper representation of child victims who have been repeatedly sexually assaulted cannot\nform the basis of a separate, “satellite” lawsuit, and therefore Edwards is entitled to summary\n- Judgment on-these grounds-as well: . er ee lee\n~~~ The truth-is the record:is entirely devoid-of-any-evidence to support Epstein’s claims-and ~~ -~\nis completely and consistently corroborative of Edwards’s sworn assertion of innocence. Put\nsimply, Epstein made allegations that have no basis in fact. To the contrary, his lawsuit was\n‘merely a desperate measure by a serial pedophile to prevent being held accountable for\nrepeatedly sexually abusing minor females. Epstein’s ulterior motives in filing and prosecuting\nthis lawsuit are blatantly obvious. Epstein's behavior is another clear demonstration that he feels\nhe lives above the law and that because of his wealth he can manipulate the system and pay for\nlawyers to do his dirty work - even to the extent of having them assert baseless claims against\nother members of the Florida Bar. Every one of Epstein’s Complaints against Edwards was\nnothing short of a far-fetched fictional fairy-tale with absolutely no evidence whatsoever to\nsupport his preposterous claims. It was his last ditch effort to escape the public disclosure by\n\nEdwards and his clients of the nature, extent, and sordid details of Epstein’s life as a serial child\n\nmolester,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013400",
