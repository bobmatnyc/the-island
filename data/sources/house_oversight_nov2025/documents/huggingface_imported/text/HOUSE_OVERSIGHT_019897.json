  "text": "What’s more, Trump refused to spend any time considering, however hypothetically,\ntransition matters, saying it was “bad luck’”—but really meaning it was a waste of time.\nNor would he even remotely contemplate the issue of his holdings and conflicts.\n\nHe wasnt going to win! Or losing was winning.\n\nTrump would be the most famous man in the world—a martyr to crooked Hillary\nClinton.\n\nHis daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared would have transformed themselves from\nrelatively obscure rich kids into international celebrities and brand ambassadors.\n\nSteve Bannon would become the de facto head of the Tea Party movement.\nKellyanne Conway would be a cable news star.\n\nReince Priebus and Katie Walsh would get their Republican Party back.\nMelania Trump could return to inconspicuously lunching.\n\nThat was the trouble-free outcome they awaited on November 8, 2016. Losing would\nwork out for everybody.\n\nShortly after eight o’clock that evening, when the unexpected trend—Trump might\nactually win—seemed confirmed, Don Jr. told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he called\nhim, looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania, to whom Donald Trump had made his\nsolemn guarantee, was in tears—and not of joy.\n\nThere was, in the space of little more than an hour, in Steve Bannon’s not unamused\nobservation, a befuddled Trump morphing into a disbelieving Trump and then into a quite\nhorrified Trump. But still to come was the final transformation: suddenly, Donald Trump\nbecame a man who believed that he deserved to be and was wholly capable of being the\npresident of the United States.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019897",
