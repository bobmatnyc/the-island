  "text": "In short, a neg will buy you the credibility you need to sincerely compliment her later.\n\nThat said, I don't necessarily advocate negs; they are in many ways a temporary patch to\nstick onto your personality while you learn to possess real confidence and strength of\ncharacter.\n\nAlthough this is a manipulative approach, it is not inevitably harmful. It also is not\nlimited to the sphere of sexual relationships; humans often pretend not to care what other\npeople think, and consistently attempt to be taken seriously by others. Additionally, for\nmany people, flirting involves a certain amount of strategic ambiguity and plausible\ndeniability, and negs are a useful tactic for that kind of game. Not everyone likes playing\nsuch tacit and confusing games, but many people do.\n\nHowever, this is all cute and mild compared to how some PUAs talk about negs: some\ncite the neg specifically as a tactic to make the girl feel bad.\n\nA well-known PUA who goes by the name of Tyler Durden once wrote that: \"You use\nself-esteem negs to lower the target's self-esteem, and crave your attention to re-validate\nherself.\" Similarly, an especially pitiless PUA blogger who is sometimes described as\n\"the Darth Vader of PUAs\" writes that:\n\nThe best negs are those which are conceivably meant as compliments, but which linger in\nher psyche for hours afterward, undermining her self-conception and encouraging her to\nqualify herself to you [i.e. encouraging her to explain why she's worth your time].... [A\nneg] infiltrates a girl's subconscious so that she spends more mental energy analyzing\nher worth than she does analyzing yours.\n\nOne commenter adds to the above blogger's words that: \"So long as you have a woman\nauditioning for you, power remains where it belongs -- squarely in your pocket.\"\n\nIn other words, a person who feels anxious and unworthy will be easier to control. These\ncruel PUAs have learned the same lesson as thousands of people in abusive relationships.\n\nHere is an especially instructive quotation from the comments on \"Darth Vader's\" blog:\n\"[Women] really are insipid, vapid airheads. If it wasn't for the pussy, there would be a\nbounty on them.” That statement is interesting not just because of its hatred but because\nof its fear. After all, no one puts a bounty on targets that are not dangerous. The most\nmisogynist corners of the PUA subculture not only discuss ways to aggressively\nmanipulate women; they also paint women as selfish, deceitful and hazardous.\n\nThe various approaches to negging highlight both the different shadings of opinion across\nthe subculture, and a particularly important distinction among PUAs themselves. Some of\nthese men genuinely do enter pickup artistry out of a desire to connect to women. As one\nPUA told me, \"When I first looked at PUA stuff, I was like, 'This is so sleazy and gross.’\nBut I'd never had a girlfriend, and I kept telling myself, \"Dude, you are lonely and\nmiserable and you don't want to die alone.\" On the other hand, many PUAs become\nPUAs because they want unilateral power and control over women -- and many PUAs\nattempt to justify this through narratives and jokes that encourage fear and anger against\nwomen.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018666",
