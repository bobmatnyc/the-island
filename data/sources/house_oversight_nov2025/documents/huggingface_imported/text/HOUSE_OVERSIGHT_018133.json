  "text": "Already some baby boomers are able to remotely lock their parents’ doors, track calls coming into\ntheir homes and even see who is ringing the doorbell, in many cases right from their smart phones.\nSystems such as QuietCare, WellAWARE, FineThanx and SimplyHome are already fixtures in\nsome U.S. homes and seniors’ communities, although Orlov estimates fewer than 10,000 units are\nin active use because the systems can be so costly.\n\nNext month, Paul Whyte, a Markham dealer of smart-home technology that allows ordinary\nelectronics and appliances to communicate with each other, will unveil the GrandCare system at\nthe Zoomer show in Toronto.\n\n“T call it the invisible caregiver,” says Whyte of Cybernetics Systems Inc. “The minute I saw this\nsystem I thought, ‘There’s something that actually makes sense.’\n\nThe key, of course, with all these technologies is that the senior be relatively able-bodied and\nsound of mind — most are of limited value if the senior is suffering from dementia, which is\nexpected to become a major public health issue in the next few decades.\n\nBut developers are also working hard on that challenging front.\n\nSometime later this fall or next spring the first GPS-equipped shoe, the Aetrex Ambulator, will go\non sale through www.gpsshoe.com orwww.foot.com.\n\nOriginally designed for children by Los Angeles-based GTX Corp., the new shoes are expected to\nretail for about $250 U.S. They enable caregivers to track those afflicted with dementia or\nAlzheimer’s thanks to GPS and cellular technology that will relay their whereabouts back to a\nmonitoring centre.\n\n“Privacy may be a talking point, but it’s not really an issue,” says Patrick Bertagna, chairman and\nCEO of GTX Corp.\n\nMED Cottage creator Dupin expects concerns around privacy will fade quickly as families and\nhealth-care systems here and in the U.S. become overwhelmed by aging baby boomers — more\nthan 76 million in the U.S., 10 million in Canada — who start hitting 65 next year.\n\n“T see remote monitoring becoming an integral part of health care as we all age,” says Dupin. “One\nof the issues around aging in place is going to be making trade-offs. Privacy may be something we\n\nhave to give up.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018133",
