Since Snowden had a long-time\ninterest in going to Japan, he was more than willing to relocate to Japan.\n\nHe had little problem obtaining the job. Aside from his family connections, he had a single\ncompelling qualification for the job—a top secret clearance. For an outside contractor such as\nDell, such a security clearance was pure gold. If a potential recruit lacked a top secret clearance,\nbefore Dell could deploy him or her at the NSA, it needed a wait for the completion of a time-\nconsuming background check. Ifa recruit already had one, as Snowden did, he could begin\nworking immediately.\n\nThe reason that Snowden still had his secrecy clearance, despite his highly-problematic exit\nfrom the CIA, was that the CIA had instituted a policy a few years earlier that allowed voluntarily-\nretiring CIA officers to keep their secrecy clearance for two years after they left. This “free pass,”\nas one former CIA officer called the two year grace period, had been intended to make it easier\nfor retiring officers to find jobs in parts of the defense industry that required secrecy clearance.\nThis accommodation, in turn, made it easier for the CIA to downsize to meet its budget.\n\nNot only did Snowden retain his security clearance, but unlike when he had applied for his job\nat the CIA in 2006, he now could list on his resume two years experience in information\ntechnology and cyber security at the CIA. All Dell could check was a single fact: Snowden was\nindeed employed at the CIA between 2006 and 2009. His CIA file, which contained the “derog,”\nwas not available to Dell or any other private company. Even though the CIA had “security\nconcerns” about Snowden, as CIA Deputy Director Morell noted, it could not convey them to\neither Dell or the NSA. “So the guy with whom the CIA had concerns left the Agency and joined\nthe ranks of the many contractors working in the intelligence community before CIA could inform\nthe rest of the IC about its worries,” Morell explained. “He even got a pay raise.” Obviously,\nthis was a glitch in the security system but, as a result of it, Snowden entered the NSA by the back\ndoor only five months after being forced out of the CIA.\n\nFor the next 45 months Dell assigned him various IT tasks at the NSA. In June 2009, he was\nsent to Japan to work in the NSA complex at the Yokota air base outside Tokyo. He moved into\na small one bedroom apartment in the nearby town of Fussia. His initial job for Dell was teaching\ncyber security to Army and Air Force personnel. In this capacity, he instructed US military\nofficers stationed at the base in how to shield their computers from hackers. Such security\ntraining had been required for military personnel dealing with classified material after several\nsuccessful break-ins to US military networks by China, Russia, and other adversary nations.\nAlthough it finally brought him to Japan, it was not a challenging or interesting job.\n\nBut Snowden found diversions in Japan. In July 2009, he was joined in Japan by Lindsay\nMills. She had become an amateur photographer, specializing in arty self portraits. She also saw\nherself as a global tourist, writing in her blog after arriving in Japan that had she travelled to 17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020208",
