  "text": "people. I do not work alone, I have a team whom I lead and encourage and on whom I rely. Within each human\nbeing there is an inexhaustible source of potential, but there is no human being with unlimited capacity. What is\nimportant is to know your capacities -- and how you should use them.\n\nFor fun, I spend my time with my family at the beach or in the desert. I love to read. I ride horses. My love for\nhorses is indescribably enormous; it is part of20my soul and history.\nThe National Abu Dhabi Media Company - Matt Slater\n\nHow are the Federal Government and the Government of Dubai cooperating to re-tool\nthe development model to address what many economists predict is a permanent\nreduction in credit available from international capital markets\n\nWhether the available global credit declines or increases, the model of our economy is stable and is developing\nwithin the framework that we created earlier. Dubai’s needs for credit tend to decline and the government’s\nloans, which are modest, compared to the size of the economy, all concern investment in infrastructure, not\ncurrent expenditures or operational budgets. The majority of our infrastructure projects are of a long-term\nproductive nature, such as the Dubai Metro, the expansion of the power generation station, and so on. With\nregard to the loans of state-owned companies -- they are purely commercial in nature, and their calculations are\nbased on the cost of the loan and the return on investment. The global financial crisis has affected the liquidity\nof the companies, and we believe that it is only a temporary impact. We have sufficient means to provide the\nnecessary liquidity for these companies. I would like to stress that Dubai's economy is part of the UAE\neconomy, and we cannot in any way deal with the situation as an independent entity. I will give you one\nexample: We say Abu Dhabi banks, Dubai banks and Sharjah banks. These terms relate to the location of the\nheadquarters only, since all banks operate in all the seven Emirates, and are subject to fiscal and monetary\npolicy overseen by one body, and one central bank. In any case, credit is always available, and even a few\nmonths after the financial crisis, it had been available. Of course, this does not mean that all the available credit\nis desirable. This issue is a subject to extensive studies and discussions and to cost-benefit equations.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nThe question of population demography has been a source of worry to the UAE\nnationals, as it must certainly worry Your Highness. You have announced some\ninitiatives in this regard, uncovering a few of them. Could you tell us more about these\ninitiatives?\n\nThis question is important because of its ramifications and interconnection of its economic, social, and cultural\ndimensions. His Highness the President of the UAE has defined our approach toward this question. He has said\nthat we have a positive outlook toward the demographic structure, showing the ability of our people and state to\nmix this human quantity and variety in a human framework, capable of creating a model highlighting the power\nof human interaction in the process of building and raising our state to assume an advanced position on the level\nof civilization and development. Such a model will help us in gaining the respect and appreciation of local and\nin ternational organizations for our human and civilized treatment of all residents in our country, providing\nincentives for them to take active part in the development process of the UAE.\n\nThis vision, as defined by His Highness the President, does not remove from our sight the necessity of\npreserving our national identity. This was the starting point which led to the formation of a high-level\ncommittee, headed by the minister of interior, to deal with the question of demographic structure. We highly\nappreciate the work of this committee, which drew out a number of initiatives to deal with this question and\ntake active measures in this connection. We are preparing other measures and decisions within our declared and\ntransparent policy for dealing with the question of demographic structure in a civilized manner, without\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024939",
