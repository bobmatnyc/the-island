The\npuzzles I have set often benefit from creative thinking. I have made\nfinding the answers to these problems a little hard, so you are not\ntempted to cheat. I want you to try to solve the problems and ‘feel’ your\nbrain working.\n\nThis book argues that intuitive thought solves problems in a\ndifferent way to analytical thought. The process takes time and often\nbenefits from putting a problem to one side while you use your mind\nto process foreground tasks. I hope you read this book at a time when\nthe website is not available — or at least don't peek. Give your intuitive\nthought processes time to work.\n\nGraham Wallas described the process of creative thinking in 1926\nand I think it is still one of the best models we have:\n\nFirst you must prepare and become fully acquainted\nwith the problem. It might seem impossible but don't despair,\njust commit to it. Next, you should leave the problem to\nstew — incubation, he called it. After a while, you will feel\na solution is at hand. You don’t quite have it yet but you are\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015691",
