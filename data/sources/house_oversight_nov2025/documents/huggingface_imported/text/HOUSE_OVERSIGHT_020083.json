And no decision hounded\nhim so much—teally from the first moment of his presidency—as what to do about\nAfghanistan. It was a conundrum that became a battle. It involved not only his own\nresistance to analytic reasoning, but the left brain/right brain divide of his White House,\nthe split between those who argued for disruption and those who wanted to uphold the\nStatus quo.\n\nIn this, Bannon became the disruptive and unlikely White House voice for peace—or\nanyway a kind of peace. In Bannon’s view, only he and the not-too-resolute backbone of\nDonald Trump stood between consigning fifty thousand more American soldiers to\nhopelessness in Afghanistan.\n\nRepresenting the status quo—and, ideally, a surge on top of the status quo—was H. R.\nMcMaster, who, next to Jarvanka, had become Bannon’s prime target for abuse. On this\nfront, Bannon forged an easy bond with the president, who didn’t much hide his contempt\nfor the Power-Point general. Bannon and the president enjoyed trash-talking McMaster\ntogether.\n\nMcMaster was a protégé of David Petraeus, the former CENTCOM and Afghanistan\ncommander who became Obama’s CIA director before resigning in a scandal involving a\nlove affair and the mishandling of classified information. Petraeus and now McMaster\nrepresented a kind of business-as-usual approach in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A\nstubborn McMaster kept proposing to the president new versions of the surge, but at each\npitch Trump would wave him out of the Oval Office and roll his eyes in despair and\ndisbelief.\n\nThe president’s distaste and rancor for McMaster grew on pace with the approaching\nneed to finally make a decision on Afghanistan, a decision he continued to put off. His\nposition on Afghanistan—a military quagmire he knew little about, other than that it was a\nquagmire—had always been a derisive and caustic kiss-off of the sixteen-year war.
