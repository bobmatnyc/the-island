Would newly liberated Arab\ncitizenries seek revenge against Western powers?\n\nMy impression is that this will depend on the new policies that these\nWestern powers adopt, rather than on what they did in the past. Most\nArabs are critical of Western powers because they unquestioningly\nback Israel or support Arab autocrats. Should those policies be\nmoderated and replaced by more even-handed postures toward the\nMiddle East, newly liberated Arab citizens would probably be too\nbusy building their new countries to allow themselves to be distracted\nby lingering resentments from the past.\n\nWhat is the single most important development that could trigger\nregime change in some countries now facing domestic challenges and\nunrest, one person asked? Three reasons come to mind: economic\ncollapse could do so; or key figures in the military and security\nagencies could stop protecting the regime; or strategically placed\ncommercial, tribal, sectarian and business leaders in society could\ndecide that the current course was disastrous and, in consequence,\ncould bring about the fall of the regime.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032182",
