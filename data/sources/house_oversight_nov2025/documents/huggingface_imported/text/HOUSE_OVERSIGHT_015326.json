  "text": "In his new book, Bob Woodward writes about Colin Powell’ s status\nas an adviser to you. Referring to his previous book, Plan of Attack, the\nNew York Times then reported that “Secretary of State Colin Powell\ndisputed Woodward’ s account....He said that he had an excellent\nrelationship with Vice President Dick Cheney, and that he did not recall\nreferring to officials at the Pentagon loyal to Cheney as the ‘Gestapo\noffice.’ \" Who among us would be unable to recall uttering such an\nepithet? Powell later apologized for it. He has also changed his mind about\ngays in the military. In my capacity as a stand-up satirist, | used to conduct\nan imaginary dialogue with Powell.\n\n“General Powell, you’ re the first African-American to be head of\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, and you come from the tradition of a military\nfamily. So you know that blacks were once segregated in the Army\nbecause the other soldiers might feel uncomfortable if blacks slept in the\nsame barracks. And now that’ s what they say about gays, that other\nsoldiers might feel uncomfortable about gays sleeping in the same\nbarracks.”\n\n“Well, you have to understand, we never fto/d anybody we were\n\nblack.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015326",
