Objective: an alliance between\nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections\n\nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who\nwas Donald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist\nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast\nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in the heart of Europe\nand its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the European\nelections which will be held in spring 2019.\n\nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of\nthe Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of\nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused of\nplots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have labour at\nlow cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior Matteo\nSalvini.\n\nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the\nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and Rome\n— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of which he has long\nsince been dreaming.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019305",
