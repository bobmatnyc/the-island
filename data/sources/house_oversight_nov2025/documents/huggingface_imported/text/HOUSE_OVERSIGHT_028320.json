Organised by Channel 4 and The Saatchi Gallery, this\nprestigious event aims to discover the most imaginative and talented artists graduating from BA and MA courses\nin the UK and to support students leaving art college.\n\nA total of 20 students were shortlisted to present their work in the exhibition. This is being held at Boswall\nHouse, 2 Cornwall Terrace - a magnificent 18th century building off Regent's Park - from 14th to 20th October.\nThe event forms part of ‘The House of the Nobleman’, under the curatorship of Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria\nGolembiovskaya.\n\nFour of the finalists in New Sensations 2010 - Pablo Wendel, Katie Surridge, Nika Neelova and Ula Wiznerowicz -\nhave each been given a bursary to develop a new work for the exhibition. A short film about each of them was\naired on Channel 4 in early October.\n\nStephen Glynn, Cadogan Tate's Fine Art Director, comments: “We are delighted to be the sponsors of this\nimportant exhibition, which showcases the talent of some remarkable young artists. We have spent many years\ntransporting and storing the world's most precious contemporary art for leading museums, galleries and\ncollectors. It therefore seemed very appropriate that we should support and encourage the UK's leading art\n\nstudents through this exciting event.”\n\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/prweb2010/10/prweb4659384.htm\n\n40\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028320",
