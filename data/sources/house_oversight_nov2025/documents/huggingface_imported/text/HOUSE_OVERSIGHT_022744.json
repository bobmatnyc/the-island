  "text": "Departments agreement not to prosecute in favor of the state action. In 2014,\nEdwards tries to ad Virginia Roberts, another of the original complainants,\nwho has previously settled with Epstein, to the long-running suit. Roberts\nwho was paid a settlement under the original terms of Epstein’s agreement—\nthat he would pay attorney’s fees and not oppose any law suits against\nhim—is now trying to overturn the agreement under which she was paid,\nand, with Edwards, further suing Epstein for $50,000,000.\n\nAs the most vocal of the accusers, Roberts, with the Daily Mail being\nher prime outlet, emerges now with what is billed as a memoir of her “sex\nslavery” with Epstein, written ten years after the fact. She names a number\nof people as being at Epstein’s Island home, including Clinton and Al Gore\nand his wife, who Epstein’s lawyers insists were never there—proof\navailable through secret service records.\n\nThe FBI is now arguing that Roberts should not be party to the suit\nagainst the government because she refused to cooperate with the\ngovernment in its investigation in 2007, hence has no standing as a victim.\n(At the same time, the FBI included her on the list of 40 victims with whom\nit mandated Epstein reach a settlement.)\n\nIt is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers\nthen in Epstein’s case.\n\nEdwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton,\nDonald Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly\nfrom the original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about\nEpstein.\n\nIn addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to\nEpstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton\ntakes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or\nimagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.\n\nAlmost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is approached\nby other media seeking to write about Epstein, often with financial\nincentives.\n\nNo new details emerge. Every aspect of the current story is based on\ncourt filings describing events that may or may not have taken place prior to\n2007.\n\nA recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not given\nmoney to in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would give it back.\n\nThe world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure\n\nwalls and the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms, ever more\nincredulous and apoplectic that Epstein not only walks free but prospers too.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022744",
