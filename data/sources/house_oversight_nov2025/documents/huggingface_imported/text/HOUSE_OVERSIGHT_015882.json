  "text": "runners included 1200 international athletes and 20,000 amateurs.\nAn estimated 20 million viewers watched from around the world.\nThe top international runners stayed together for the first twenty miles\nand then two runners, American Dick Beardsley and Norwegian Inge\nSimonsen, made a push for the finish. They were long-standing rivals\nand, as they ran the final mile each man challenged the other to see if\nthey could get ahead and gain the advantage. Because of the fine balance\nhuman muscles maintain between anaerobic and aerobic metabolism,\nthe small set advantage could prove insurmountable. The other runner\nwould need to sprint to catch up and the resultant lactic acid generated\nwould turn their legs to jelly. As the two runners neared the finish line\nthey glanced at each other, smiled, reached out and held hands as they\ncrossed the line. Who won?\nWe all instinctively know the answer. The race was a draw, but the\nrules of the International Athletics Federation are clear. Read rule 164.\n\nEF the spring of 1981, London staged its first marathon. The field of\n\nRULE 164\n\nThe Finish\n1. The finish of a race shall be denoted by a white line 5 cm wide.\n2. The athletes shall be placed in the order in which any part of\ntheir bodies (i.e. torso, as distinguished from the head, neck,\narms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the finish\nline.\n\nThe organizing committee held a brief conference and the result\ndeclared a draw. They had interpreted the rules in the same way 20\nmillion TV viewers already ‘knew’ to be true.\n\nThis story should set your minds thinking about the nature of rules\nand truth and how the two are often different. According to the rules,\none person crossed the line a little ahead of the other. The truth, as we\nall instinctively know, is that the race was a draw. Maybe the rulebook\nis missing a rule — “The contact draw rule. Clearly you could amend the\nrulebook to add this one rule. I checked the current athletics rules and\nthey don't contain this amendment. If the rules were amended the mis-\nchievous amongst you will realize an unsporting athlete could grab the\nhand of their opponent as they crossed the line to force a draw. The rules\nwould have to stipulate that holding hands must be voluntary for both\nparties, and refinements could go on for some time. What if I held your\nhand but you tripped and let go? What if my attempt to hold your hand\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015882",
