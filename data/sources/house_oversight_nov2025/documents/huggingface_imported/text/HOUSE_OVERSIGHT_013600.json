  "text": "distributions of neuronal interspike intervals have increasingly /ong tails. Contrary to\nthe behavior of a normally distributed observable, the larger the series of neuronal\nspike observed, the more likely that a longer interspike interval than had been seen\nbefore will occur. Counter-intuitively, long intervals tend to be followed by more long\nintervals as more shorts follow short intervals. Manic attacks cluster in time as does\na number of other brain and body diseases. Maybe it is intuitively obvious that bad\nstuff tends to cause more bad stuff and good stuff is self-propagating. Having\nsuffered recently does not mean fate owes you one. The brain’s syncopated\n\nsegmentations of time can be translated into a creatively arrhythmic dance.\n\nWhat makes neurologizing conversations like these about subtle human\nexperience possible are the human subjective scenarios we have agreed to short\nhand with names of brain parts and neurochemicals. The how is where conceptual\nconnection is filled with post 19'° Century Spanish microscopic neuroanatomist,\nSantiago Ramon y Cajal-like, intuitions about the functional role of brain structures:\nwe think motor automaticity and pacing when hearing the brain place names such\nas caudate, putamen and cerebellum; we think limbic lobe when musing about\nsexuality, rage and depression; we short hand /eft versus right hemispheric places\nfor verbal and sequential versus intuitive and geometric shape cognition; we point to\nthe frontal lobe for the future work of executive control, anticipation and paranoia;\nthe hypothalamus for primitively expressed appetites and to the brain stem for our\nvital functions such as breathing and blood pressure. With respect to the brain\njuices, we say dopamine for aggressive activity, norepinephrine for attention and\nsensory discrimination and serotonin for hunger, mood and sexual inclination. No\nmatter how avant guarde our experimental techniques such as monitoring local\nfunctional blood supply by fMRI, regional brain glucose utilization maps, time-\ndependent changes in_ skull surface voltage using a cap studded with\nelectroencephalographic, EEG, leads, monitoring these voltage field via their\ntransverse magnetic fields by the frozen helmets of magnetoencephalography,\nMEG, we conclude our work by calling forth named but still enigmatic brain parts\nand their juices as mysteriously powerful little men and women executing\n\nremarkably complex and subtle tasks, sometimes even when called upon.\n\n100\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013600",
