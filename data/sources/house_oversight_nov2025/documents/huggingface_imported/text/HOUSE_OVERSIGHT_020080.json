  "text": "into line his daughter and her husband, Hicks, and Raffel. Kasowitz—the lawyer whose\nspecific job was to keep Trump at arm’s length from Russian-related matters—was kept\non hold on the phone for an hour and then not put through. The president insisted that the\nmeeting in Trump Tower was purely and simply about Russian adoption policy. That’s\nwhat was discussed, period. Period. Even though it was likely, if not certain, that the Zimes\nhad the incriminating email chain—in fact, it was quite possible that Jared and Ivanka and\nthe lawyers knew the Times had this email chain—the president ordered that no one should\nlet on to the more problematic discussion about Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt was a real-time example of denial and cover-up. The president believed,\nbelligerently, what he believed. Reality was what he was convinced it was—or should be.\nHence the official story: there was a brief courtesy meeting in Trump Tower about\nadoption policy, to no result, attended by senior aides and unaffiliated Russian nationals.\nThe crafting of this manufactured tale was a rogue operation by rookies—always the two\nmost combustible elements of a cover-up.\n\nIn Washington, Kasowitz and the legal team’s spokesperson, Mark Corallo, weren’t\ninformed of either the Zimes article or the plan for how to respond to it until Don Jr.’s\ninitial statement went out just before the story broke that Saturday.\n\nOver the course of next seventy-two hours or so, the senior staff found itself wholly\nseparate from—and, once again, looking on in astonishment at—the actions of the\npresident’s innermost circle of aides. In this, the relationship of the president and Hope\nHicks, long tolerated as a quaint bond between the older man and a trustworthy young\nwoman, began to be seen as anomalous and alarming. Completely devoted to\naccommodating him, she, his media facilitator, was the ultimate facilitator of unmediated\nbehavior. His impulses and thoughts—unedited, unreviewed, unchallenged—not only\npassed through him, but, via Hicks, traveled out into the world without any other White\nHouse arbitration.\n\n“The problem isn’t Twitter, it’s Hope,” observed one communication staffer.\n\nOn July 9, a day after publishing its first story, the Zimes noted that the Trump Tower\nmeeting was specifically called to discuss the Russian offer of damaging material about\nClinton. The next day, as the Zimes prepared to publish the full email chain, Don Jr.\nhurriedly dumped it himself. There followed an almost daily count of new figures—all, in\ntheir own way, peculiar and unsettling—who emerged as participants in the meeting.\n\nBut the revelation of the Trump Tower meeting had another, perhaps even larger\ndimension. It marked the collapse of the president’s legal strategy: the demise of Steve\nBannon’s Clinton-emulating firewall around the president.\n\nThe lawyers, in disgust and alarm, saw, in effect, each principal becoming a witness to\nanother principal’s potential misdeeds—all conspiring with one another to get their stories\nstraight. The client and his family were panicking and running their own defense. Short-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020080",
