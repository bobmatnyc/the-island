  "text": "And only then: “We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite\ntogether in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence... . We must rediscover the\nbonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans... . Racism is evil. And\nthose who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs including the KKK, neo-\nNazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold\ndear as Americans.”\n\nIt was a reluctant mini-grovel. It was something of a restaging of the take-it-back\nbirther speech about Obama during the campaign: much distraction and obfuscation, then\na mumbled acknowledgment. Similarly, he looked here, trying to tow the accepted line on\nCharlottesville, like a kid called on the carpet. Resentful and petulant, he was clearly\nreading forced lines.\n\nAnd in fact he got little credit for these presidential-style remarks, with reporters\nshouting questions about why it had taken him so long to address the issue. As he got back\non Marine One to head to Andrews Air Force Base and on to JFK and then into Manhattan\nand Trump Tower, his mood was dark and I-told-you-so. Privately, he kept trying to\nrationalize why someone would be a member of the KK K—that is, they might not actually\nbelieve what the KKK believed, and the KKK probably does not believe what it used to\nbelieve, and, anyway, who really knows what the KKK believes now? In fact, he said, his\nown father was accused of being involved with the KK K—not true. (In fact, yes, true.)\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, August 15, the White House had a news conference scheduled\nat Trump Tower. Bannon urged Kelly to cancel it. It was a nothing conference anyway. Its\npremise was about infrastructure—about undoing an environmental regulation that could\nhelp get projects started faster—but it was really just another effort to show that Trump\nwas working and not just on a holiday. So why bother? What’s more, Bannon told Kelly,\nhe could see the signs: the arrow on the Trump pressure cooker was climbing, and before\nlong he’d blow.\n\nThe news conference went ahead anyway. Standing at the lectern in the lobby of\nTrump Tower, the president stayed on script for mere minutes. Defensive and self-\njustifying, he staked out a contrition-is-bunk, the-fault-lies-everywhere-else position and\nthen dug in deep. He went on without an evident ability to adjust his emotions to political\ncircumstance or, really, even to make an effort to save himself. It was yet one more\nexample, among his many now, of the comic-absurd, movielike politician who just says\nwhatever is on his mind. Unmediated. Crazylike.\n\n“What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, altright? Do they have\nany semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?\nAs far as I’m concerned that was a horrible, horrible day... . I think there’s blame on both\nsides. I have no doubt about it, you don’t have any doubt about it. If you reported it\naccurately, you would see.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020107",
