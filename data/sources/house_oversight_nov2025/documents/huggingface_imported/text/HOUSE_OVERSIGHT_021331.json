A new child in\n\n? The lead author is Jean Decety, Ph.D., the\nIrving B. Harris Professor in the Departments of\nPsychology and Psychiatry, and co-director of\nthe Brain Research Imaging Center at the\nUniversity of Chicago Medical Center. He is the\neditor of the journal Social Neuroscience. His\ninterests clude the investigation of the\nneurobiological mechanisms underpinning\ninterpersonal sensitivity, particularly empathy\nand sympathy. His recent work focuses on\ndevelopmental neuroscience with both typically\ndeveloping children and adolescents as well as in\nchildren with deficits in empathic responding\nsuch as antisocial behavior problems. Decety has\npublished more than 115 scientific papers, and\nrecently edited the Social Neuroscience of\nEmpathy (2009, MIT press), and Interpersonal\nSensitivity: Entering Others’ World (2007,\nPsychology Press).\n\nEmpathy and sympathy play crucial\nroles in much of human social interaction and are\nnecessary components for healthy co-existence.\nSympathy is thought to have a key role in\nmotivating prosocial behavior, guides our\npreferences and behavioral responses, and\nprovides the affective and motivational base for\nmoral development. Although the study of these\nabilities has traditionally been examined using\nbehavioral and clinical methods, recent work in\nsocial neuroscience has begun to provide\ncompelling and novel insights on the neural\nmechanisms involved in interpersonal\nsensitivity. These developments are explored in\nthis essay.\n\nscomponent\n\nPage |85\n\ndaycare is being ignored by the other\nchildren with the exception of one little\nboy who takes her hand and includes her\nin all his activities. These modest\nbeginnings signal the important and\nongoing role of empathy for surviving\nand flourishing in our social world.\nEmpathy has been suggested to be\nessential to navigating the social world;\nit enhances our understanding of others,\nimproves the effectiveness of our social\ncommunication, and fosters mutually\nsatisfying social relationships.\nConversely, lack of empathy or its\nmaladaptive use causes social\nrelationships to falter and fail.\n\nEmpathy refers to our natural\ncapacity to quickly and automatically\nrelate to the emotional states of another\nperson. Rudimentary forms of empathy\nappear early in the life course, and with\nmaturation, empathy can be experienced\nby simply reading about or imagining\nsomeone else’s emotion. Empathy\ncomes so naturally that physicians must\nlearn to dampen their empathic pain\nresponses when inserting a needle into a\npatient (1). Just because empathy comes\nnaturally does not mean, however, that it\nis instantiated in a discrete brain module\nthat is automatically activated when one\nwitnesses another’s distress or suffering.\nRather, the experience of empathy is\nunderpinned by the combined activity of\nseveral dissociable psychobiological\nsystems. Further, empathy can be\nmodulated by various contextual,\ndispositional, and interpersonal factors.\nThe study of empathy, using\nsophisticated methods from psychology,\nneurology, neuroimaging, and\nneuropsychology, provide a unique\nopportunity to understand the invisible\npower of empathy in shaping our\nobligatorily gregarious social nature.\n\nDefining empathy and its functions\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021331",
