Throughout the text, “past-\nWWII cycles” refers to\nexpansions beginning in G2\n1954. We exclude two prior\nexpansions, beginning in Q4\n1945 and Q4 1949, to ensure\nconsistent data across all\nvariables used to analyze\nthe duration and strength\nof recoveries (some data\nseries are only available since\n1950) as well as to avoid\ncontaminating summary\nstatistics given idiosyncratic\neconomic policies that followed\nthe end of WWII (such as the\nsharp reduction in military\nspending or the Gl Bill). Gur\ntakeaway from the analysis\nwould not change if 1945\nand 1949 were included for\nthe series for which data is\navailable.\n\n4.
