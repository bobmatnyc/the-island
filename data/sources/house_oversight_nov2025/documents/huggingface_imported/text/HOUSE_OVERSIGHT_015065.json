  "text": "intended to become an underground abortion referral service, but it\nwasn't going to stop just because in the next issue of 7he Realist | would\npublish an interview with somebody else.\n\nA few years later, state police raided Dr. Spencer's clinic and arrested\nhim. He remained out of jail only by the grace of political pressure from\nthose he'd helped. He was finally forced to retire from his practice, but |\ncontinued mine, referring callers to other physicians that he had\nrecommended. Occasionally | would be offered money by a patient, but |\nnever accepted it. And whenever a doctor offered me a kickback, | refused,\nbut | also insisted that he give a discount for the same amount to those\npatients referred by me.\n\nEventually, | was subpoenaed by district attorneys in two cities to\nappear before grand juries investigating criminal charges against\nabortionists. On both occasions | refused to testify, and each time the D.A.\ntried to frighten me into cooperating with the threat of arrest.\n\nIn Liberty, New York, my name had been extorted from a patient by\nthreatening Aer with arrest. The D.A. told me that the doctor had\nconfessed everything and they got it all on tape. He gave me until two\no'clock that afternoon to change my mind about testifying, or else the\n\npolice would come to take me away.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015065",
