  "text": "88\n\nspecific NSA, CIA and Pentagon operations unknown to adversaries. These Level 3 documents\nare described by NSA executives as “the Keys to the Kingdom” because they could invalidate\nAmerica’s entire intelligence enterprise if they fell into the hands of an adversary. And, as far as is\nknown, prior to 2013, there had been no successful theft of any Level 3 documents.\n\nBecause of their extreme sensitivity, Level 3 documents were not handled by most of the\nprivate firms providing independent contractors. At Dell, Snowden had access mainly to Level 1\nand Level 2 data (which he could, and did, download from shared sites on the NSA Net.) These\nlower level documents had whistle-blowing potential since they concerned NSA operations in the\nUS. They did not reveal, however, sources that the NSA used in intercepting the military and\ncivilian activities of foreign adversaries. Consequently, at Dell, while Snowden could find\ndocuments of great interest to journalists, he did not have the opportunity to steal far more\nvaluable data, such as the Level 3 lists of the NSA’s sources abroad.\n\nSnowden quit his job at Dell as a system administrator on March 15, 2013 to take another job\nworking the NSA in Hawaii at Booz Allen Hamilton. Unlike other outside contractors that\nserviced the NSA, the firm he choose, Booz Allen specialized in handling the NSA’s Level 3 data.\n\nWhen Snowden applied to Booz Allen earlier in March 2013, the company had no opening for a\nsystem administrator at the National Threat Operations Center, an NSA unit in which it dealt with\nLevel 3 data. It did have an opening for an infrastructure analyst, a lower-paying job involving\nmaintaining the computer technology necessary to monitor threats. Despite the cut in pay,\nSnowden took that job. Snowden made no secret of one of his reason for this move. He\nsubsequently told the South China Morning Post, as will be recalled, that he took it to “get access\nto lists of machines all over the world the NSA had hacked.” If so, he was after the keys to the\nNSA’s kingdom of global surveillance. And Booz Allen held those keys. \"He targeted my\ncompany because we enjoy more access than other companies,\" Booz Allen Vice Chairman\nMichael McConnell said with the benefit of hindsight. As a result of the theft, he appraised “an\nentire generation of intelligence was lost.” McConnell, a former NSA director before taking the\njob at Booz Allen, was in a position to know.\n\nSnowden’s sudden career change had both advantages and disadvantages for the enterprise he\nwas planning. The main advantage was that the job, he would have proximity to the computers in\nwhich the “lists” he sought of NSA global sources were kept. The main disadvantage, aside from\na cut in salary, was that he would no longer be a system administrator. This change meant he\nwould not have a system administrator’s privileges to bypass password restrictions or temporarily\ntransfer data. Instead, as an infrastructure analyst, he would not have password access, at least\nduring the two-month long training period, to the computers that he had not been specifically\n“read into,” which did not include those computers that stored the Level 3 lists. Access to these\ntightly-controlled compartments was limited to only a handful of analysts at the center who had a\nneed-to-know.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020240",
