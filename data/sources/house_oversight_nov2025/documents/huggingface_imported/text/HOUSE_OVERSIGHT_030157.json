But it wasn’t at hand. It took three more months to\ncomplete the Paris Peace Accords, which collapsed in 1975 when\nNorth Vietnam overran Saigon.\n\nThis Vietnam history is a caution against premature optimism about\ndiplomatic solutions to deeply embedded conflicts, such as the one in\nAfghanistan. But the fact remains, as is so often stated, that there is\nno military solution to such conflicts. The challenge is creating a\ndialogue among people who profoundly mistrust each other — and\naverting a pell-mell civil war.\n\nPresident Obama is embracing the logic of a political settlement for\nAfghanistan with his speech Wednesday night. With Osama bin\nLaden dead, Obama can claim that America’s core mission of\ncombating al-Qaeda is succeeding. He can bring some troops home\nand step up diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban to reach a broad\npeace deal by 2014.\n\nObama’s strategy for the Afghanistan negotiations highlights two\nfactors that could also be relevant in the increasingly messy conflicts\nin Libya and Syria. First, the dialogue must be sponsored by people\ninside the country that’s facing internal strife. The United States may\nencourage contacts, but the process has to be “Afghan-led,” or\n“Libyan-led,” or “Syrian-led.” Second, this dialogue requires a\nregional framework, so that the combatants don’t turn to meddling\nneighbors for help.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030157",
