We compute the frequency in our year 2000\nlexicon for all 116,156 words (1-grams) in the AHD (year 2000). We represent the percentage of these\nwords whose frequency is smaller than the value on the x-axis (logarithmic scale, base 10). 90% of all\nwords in AHD are more frequent than 1 part per billion (10°), but only 75% are more frequent than 1\npart per 100 million (10°).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017045",
