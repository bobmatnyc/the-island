  "text": "16\n\nAdvisors: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon\nPanetta, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon.\n\nOn the issues:\n\nAfghanistan/Pakistan: \"We have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat,\"\nObama announced last June, noting that the 33,000 \"surge\" troops he\nsent to Afghanistan in 2009 would be out of the country by the\nsummer of 2012. Although a constant barrage of drone strikes and\nspecial operations raids have taken a harsh toll on al Qaeda, it may be\ndifficult for Obama to make the case that Afghanistan has achieved\nstability or that Hamid Karzai's government can stand on its own\nwithout U.S. assistance.\n\nRelations with Pakistan have deteriorated significantly under\nObama's tenure, particularly following the bin Laden raid. He has\npledged to \"constantly evaluate\" the relationship between the two\ncountries going forward but says he would be hesitant to cut off aid\nthat could \"help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and\ntheir own government.\"\n\nMilitary spending: Backed by his then current defense secretary,\nRobert Gates, Obama announced last April that the Pentagon will\nlead a \"fundamental review\" of U.S. military capabilities in order to\ncut $400 billion in defense spending over the next 10 years. \"We\nneed to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and\neffectiveness, but conduct a fundamental review of America's\nmissions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world,\" Obama\nsaid. Of course, major cuts could come sooner than that if the\ncongressional \"supercommittee\" fails to reach an agreement on deficit\nreduction by Nov. 23.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031956",
