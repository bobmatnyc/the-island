We have discussed these projects before (EoTM September 2009). The\nsub-salt fields in Brazil lay 7 kilometers below the surface of the ocean, beneath a thick salt canopy in the Lower Tertiary\nregion. Oil extraction can be quite complicated due to the low permeability and porosity of the salt canopy, and tar pockets.\nOur investments in this region are linked to providing services, rather than owning exploration and production assets\nthemselves. Overall, our experience in conventional energy investments has generally been positive.\n\nRenewable energy investments. Our experience with renewable energy investing has much more mixed, for many of the\nreasons outlined in this paper. Some wind projects have worked well, while others (in the UK and in upstate New York) have\nnot, mostly a function of less windy conditions than project managers anticipated. As with conventional energy, some of the\nbetter wind projects are related to providing services (constructing offshore wind farms, development for purposes of sale),\nrather than taking ongoing operating risk. Weather played a negative role as well: higher than expected precipitation in Brazil\nnegatively affected our investments in sugar cane ethanol. Solar projects are on track (utility-scale projects in the US and\nEurope, and a company providing distributed solar solutions to small business), although both are highly dependent on\ncontinued subsidies. Natural gas discoveries have effectively raised the efficiency hurdle rate for renewable projects, and fiscal\nproblems in the West may reduce the subsidies that underpin many renewable projects and valuations.\n\nMichael Cembalest\nChief Investment Officer\n\nNotes\n\nVaclav Smil is a Distinguished Professor in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg and a Fellow\nof the Royal Society of Canada. His interdisciplinary research has included the studies of energy systems (resources,\nconversions, and impacts), environmental change (particularly global biogeochemical cycles), and the history of technical\nadvances and interactions among energy, environment, food, economy, and population. He is the author of thirty books and\nmore than three hundred papers on these subjects and has lectured widely in North America, Europe, and Asia. He is also noted\nby Foreign Policy magazine as #49 on its list of the 100 most influential thinkers in the world.\n\nCitations\n\n“Knergy Myths and Realities”, Vaclav Smil, AEI Press, 2010.\n\n“Year in Review — EROI or energy return on energy invested”, Charles Hall and David Murphy, Annals of the New York\nAcademy of Sciences, January 2010.\n\n“National Electric Transmission Congestion Study”, US Department of Energy, December 2009.\n\n“Annual Energy Outlook 2011 Reference Case”’, Richard Newell, US Energy Information Administration, December 16, 2010.\n“Energy and the Wealth of Nations: Understanding the Biophysical Economy”, Charles Hall of SUNY ESF (who was kind\nenough to review this Eye on the Market) and Kent Klitgaard, Springer NY, 2011.\n\nFor more information on Eos and zinc-air battery storage, see www.eosenergystorage.com\n\nAcronyms Conversions used in examples 1-6\n\nCAFE Corporate average fuel economy 1 megawatt = 1,000,000 watts\n\nERCOT Electricity Reliability Council of Texas 1 terawatt = 1,000,000 megawatts\n\nEPRI Electric Power Research Institute 1 petawatt = 1,000 teiesvalls\n\nHVDC High voltage direct current (segewalt - eee) ellen\n\nNIMBY Not in my backyard! a aa _ =i200 negaloules\n. 1 gigajoule = 1,000 megajoules\n\nEROI Energy return on energy invested 1 liter gasoline = 35 megajoules\n\nIPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 1 mile = 1.609 kilometers\n\nCCS Carbon capture and storage 1 gallon = 3.785 liters\n\nCO, Carbon dioxide 1 unit of carbon = 3.7 units of CO,\n\nEIA Energy Information Agency 1 metric tonne = 2,200 pounds\n\nIEA International Energy Agency 1 pound = 0.4536 kg\n\nIAEA International Atomic Energy Agency 1 barrel = 42 gallons of gasoline\n\nPV Photovoltaic solar 1 btu = 1,055 joules\n\nCSP Concentrated solar power (the parabola version)\n\nDoE Department of Energy\n\nSUNY ESF State of New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry\n\nHVAC Heating, ventilation and air conditioning\n\n8\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030821",
