Drew\nPearson, the Coast Guard’s San Juan\ncommander. .\n\n“The Coast Guard takes safety at\nsea very seriously, and will ensure\nthat any mariner who causes anoth-\ner’s death through misconduct, neg-\nligence, and inattention to his duties\nis held accountable in a court of\nlaw,” Pearson said in the release.\n\nA medical examiner pronounced\nKraftcheck, 60, of Round Lake, IIl.,\ndead at the West Indian Co. dock the\nafternoon of the accident.

Luis.is working with a\nhospital in the United States to come\nto an agreement to temporarily trans-\nfer its patients there, officials said.\n\nThe plan to temporarily close the\nunit prompted considerable discus-\nsion at the meeting. Some advocates\nfor the mentally ill, as well as some\nphysicians, raised questions about the\nwisdom of the move.\n\nBoard members said it was neces-\nsary to make improvements to the\n\nThursday night.\n\nColeman, 32, made his first\nappearance before U.S. Magistrate\nJudge Ruth Miller and was released\non a $10,000 unsecured bond,\naccording to the release.
