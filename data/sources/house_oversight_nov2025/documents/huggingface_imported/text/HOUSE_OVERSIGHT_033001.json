[jeevacation@gmail.com]\n\nSent: 5/22/2017 9:52:07 AM\nTo: Alireza Ittihadieh\nSubject: Re: lran and Trump Speech.\n\nitold you this would happen. its going to get a lot worse before it gets better.\n\nOn Mon, May 22, 2017 at 2:58 AM, Alireza Ittihadieh ii. wrote:\n\nMr. Rouhani’s supporters also expect his victory, with 57 percent of the vote, to bolster his\noutreach efforts to the West and the pursuit of more foreign investment to lift Iran’s ailing\n\neconomy.\n\nFor those who voted for Mr. Rouhani, there was a feeling of tremendous relief that his\nchallenger, the hard-line cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who criticized the nuclear deal with the United\n\nStates and other Western powers, had lost.\n“Bye-bye, Raisi,” the crowds chanted during the street gatherings.\n“He faces a difficult task,” Fazel Meybodi, a Shiite Muslim cleric from the city of Qum, said of Mr.\n\nRouhani. “Now he must provide more freedoms, break the hard-line monopoly on the state-run\n\nradio and television, and increase freedom of press.”\n\nTo achieve all that, Mr. Rouhani must persuade the hard-line-dominated judiciary and security\nforces to change their outlook, Mr. Meybodi said. “If he fails to deliver on at least 70 percent of\n\nthose promises, his future is dark,” he added.\n\nFor decades, Saudi Arabia and Iran have competed for religious leadership and political\n\ninfluence across the Muslim world and beyond.\n\nTrump is correct, however, Rouhani needs a chance to act.\nV-BR\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
