Does it \nexplain sweetheart deal? \nUpdated: 12:28 p.m. Wednesday, May 30, 2018 Posted: 12:21 p.m. Wednesday, May 30, \n2018 \nE-gcer. \nUma Sanghvi WEST PALM BEACH \nTen years after convicted Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein escaped federal charges \nin connection with allegations that he paid dozens of teenage girls for sex, the FBI last week \nreleased what appears to be an explosive explanation for what many have long described as \na sweetheart deal. \n\"Epstein has also provided information to the FBI as agreed upon,\" agents wrote in one of \ndozens of heavily redacted, decade-old memos that were unexpectedly and inexplicably \nposted on an FBI website known as \"The Vault.\" \nThe simple declaration stunned those who have been following the tortuous and celebrity-\nstudded case for years. It rekindled talk that the billionaire's 2008 decision to plead guilty to \nstate charges to make the federal investigation disappear was part of a cover up to protect \nEpstein's high-powered friends, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill  \nClinton and Britain's Prince Andrew. \n\"That sentence obviously means something but I, too, am at a loss as to what it really \nmeans,\" said attorney Brad Edwards, who for a decade has been trying to unravel the \nmystery of Epstein's plea deal. \"If there was some cooperation I would have expected that \nwe would have been told. However, nothing surprises me at this point.\" \nIn recent years, federal prosecutors have offered various explanations for why they agreed to \ndrop the case they were building against the 65-year-old enigmatic money manager if he \npleaded guilty to state prostitution charges. In court papers, they have said they wanted to \nget justice for Epstein's young victims but worried a jury wouldn't believe them. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028536 \nSo, they have said, they negotiated a deal, allowing Epstein to plead guilty in Palm Beach \nCounty Circuit Court to one count of soliciting a minor for prostitution and another charge \nof soliciting prostitution. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed to close their investigation. \nThey have said they had no idea Epstein would only serve 13 months of an 18-month \nsentence in a vacant wing of the county stockade___a cell he was allowed to leave 16 hours \na day, six days a week. \nWhile voicing dismay at his lax punishment, prosecutors have pointed out that the plea deal \nrequired Epstein to pay the roughly 30 young women who filed civil lawsuits against him. \nFurther, they said his guilty pleas force him to register as a sex offender for the rest of his \nlife, potentially protecting other girls from abuse in the future. \nHowever, over the years, they have never suggested that Epstein provided them any \ninformation in return. \nLike Edwards, two people close to the long-closed federal investigation said they were \nflummoxed by the sentence in the FBI's memo that was written in September 2008, roughly \ntwo months after Epstein pleaded guilty in state court. \n\"I have never, ever heard of Jeffrey Epstein cooperating in any sense of the word,\" said one \nofficial, who requested anonymity because of the top role the person played in the \ninvestigation. \"I am stumped. It's totally out of left field.\" \nAnother individual with ties to the case voiced similar views. Epstein may have been \nrequired to talk to FBI agents but it's unlikely he offered anything that would incriminate \nothers, said the person, who declined to be identified because of ongoing efforts to help \nEpstein's victims challenge the plea deal. \"I don't think he ever told the truth,\" the person \nsaid. \nA lawsuit Edwards filed against the federal government, claiming prosecutors violated the \nVictims Rights Act by not notifying Epstein's victims of the pending plea deal, is still \npending in U.S. District Court. Also, awaiting trial in Palm Beach County Circuit Court is a \nmalicious prosecution lawsuit Edwards filed against Epstein. Edwards claims the billionaire \nfiled a frivolous lawsuit to punish Edwards for representing a handful of Epstein's young \nvictims. \nWest Palm Beach attorney Jack Goldberger, who was on Epstein's potent defense team, said \nhe was \"unable to respond\" to questions about the FBI's memo. Other prominent lawyers \nwho represented Epstein, including New York lawyer Jay Lefkowitz and retired Harvard law \nprofessor Alan Dershowitz, didn't respond to requests for comment. \nThe one line was part of a brief missive dated Sept. 18, 2008, closing the case: \"On 9/11/08, \ncase agent advised writer that Epstein is currently being prosecuted by the State of Florida \nand is complying with all conditions of his plea with the State of Florida. Epstein has also \nprovided information to the FBI as agreed upon. Case agent advised that no federal \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028537 \nprosecution will occur in this matter as long as Epstein continues to uphold his agreement \nwith the State of Florida. ... Case agent is requested to contact writer in the event this matter \nmoves forward on a federal level.\" \nThe memo was one of hundreds of documents, including dozens of copies of newspaper \narticles about Epstein, that were posted on the FBI's website. The website, \nwww.vaultibi.gov, serves as the FBI's electronic FOIA library. The heavily redacted \ndocuments showed agents traveled to New York City, Sante Fe, N.M., and St. Thomas in the \nU.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein has homes. But there is little information about who they \ninterviewed or what they learned. \nThe only witness named in the documents is Alfredo Rodriguez, who was a houseman at \nEpstein's Palm Beach mansion in 2004. That's when Epstein regularly paid young women to \ngive him sexually-charged massages, police said. \nRodriguez was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2010 and sentenced to 18 months in jail \nfor trying to sell a journal he purloined from Epstein. Prosecutors said the journal detailed \nEpstein's sexual dalliances. Rodriguez, who lived in Kendall, died in 2014. \nThose familiar with FBI procedures said the records are administrative files, not \ninvestigative ones. Some questioned why the files were posted on the FBI's web site. The \nFBI didn't return a phone call for comment. According to the web site, the records were \nreleased \"in compliance with the National Archives and Records Administration \nrequirements.\" \nAnd while it's been 10 years since Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges and settled \ndozens of lawsuits with young women, litigation continues. \nScott J.
