  "text": "postulated, real physical world of ever-increasing entropy. He showed that at an\nabsolute temperature of zero, entropy is zero. We can illustrate an approach to this\nsingular state by placing a heated metal rod in ice water which would result in a\ndecrease in the entropy of the rod’s molecular motions by dQ/ T; < 0, the cooling\nreducing the complexity of molecular motion in the metal bar and an increase in the\nentropy of the water by dQ/T2 > 0 indicating an increase in the amount and\ncomplexity of the surrounding water’s molecular motions. Of course the heat moves\nfrom metal rod to the water as 7; +72 making dQ > 0 positive and the entropy\nchange, dS = dQ/ Tz - dQ/ T;, also positive. In another simple example, producing\nfriction by rubbing a surface generates heat, dQ > O, at a temperature 7. This\ninduces a positive change in entropy, dQ/ T > 0, in the form of increasing amount\nand complexity of the patterns of molecular motion in the air surrounding the rubbed\nsurface.\n\nUsing another related and well-known thermodynamic thought toy, the\noriginal isolated, insulated body of gas in the cylinder is partitioned by a membrane\ninto two chambers, one containing all the gas with its temperature, pressure and\nability to do mechanical work and the other a vacuum without these properties. This\nequilibrium state is changed into another equilibrium state by suddenly removing the\nmembrane, filling both chambers with gas and, while increasing its entropy\nirreversibly, dS > 0, removes at least some of the gas’s ability to do piston raising\nwork. In the context of classical thermodynamics, it is in this way that irreversibility\ncan be defined by its associated increase in entropy. Though there has been no\nchange in total energy in this insulated closed system, an increase in entropy\nmeans a decrease of the energy available for work. The increased disorder in the\ngas is associated with the loss of ability to convert heat, thermal energy, into\nmechanical energy. Historically important and still available elementary texts by\nEnrico Fermi (1936), Mark Zemansky (1957) and Herbert Callen (1985), among\nmany others, explicate clearly the formal, but far from biologically relevant, classical\n\ntheory of the physical entropy of closed equilibrium thermodynamic systems.\n\nGrowing in part out of the formal thermodynamics of physics, statistical\n\nmechanics offers yet another set of intuitions about the not-necessarily-known\n\n73\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013573",
