  "text": "(Rome, Milan, Florence), Spain (Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla), and Holland (Amsterdam). In all of these\nplaces, it is possible to live well while spending little. I spend less in Tokyo than in California because I\nknow it well. Hip, recently gentrified artist areas, not unlike the Brooklyn of 10 years ago, can be found\nin almost all cities. The one place I can’t seem to find a decent lunch for less than $20 U.S.? London.\n\nHere are a few exotic places I don’t recommend for vagabonding virgins, though veterans can make\nthem all work: all countries in Africa, the Middle East, or Central and South America (excepting Costa\nRica and Argentina). Mexico City and Mexican border areas are also a bit too kidnap-happy to make it\nonto my favorites list.\n\n4. Prepare for your trip. Here’s the countdown.\n\n=» Three months out— Eliminate\n\nGet used to minimalism before the departure. Here are the questions to ask and act upon, even if you\nnever plan to leave:\n\nWhat is the 20% of my belongings that I use 80% of the time? Eliminate the other 80% in clothing,\nmagazines, books, and all else. Be ruthless— you can always repurchase things you can’t live without.\n\nWhich belongings create stress in my life? This could relate to maintenance costs (money and energy),\ninsurance, monthly expenses, time consumption, or simple distraction. Eliminate, eliminate, eliminate. If\nyou sell even a few expensive items, it could finance a good portion of your mini-retirement. Don’t rule\nout the car and home. It’s always possible to purchase either upon your return, often losing no money in\nthe process.\n\nCheck current health insurance coverage for extended overseas travel. Get the wheels in motion to\nrent, swap, or sell your home—renting out is most recommended by serial vagabonds—or end your\napartment lease and move all belongings into storage.\n\nIn all cases where doubts crop up, ask yourself, “If I had a gun to my head and had to do it, how\nwould I do it?” It’s not as hard as you think.\n\n= Two months out— Automate\n\nAfter eliminating the excess, contact companies (including suppliers) that bill you regularly and set up\nautopayment with credit cards that have reward points. Telling them that you will be traveling the world\nfor a year often persuades them to accept credit cards rather than chase you around the planet like\nCarmen Sandiego.\n\nFor the credit card companies themselves and others that refuse, arrange automatic debit from your\nchecking account. Set up online banking and bill payment. Set up all companies that won’t take credit\ncards or automatic debit as online payees. Set these scheduled checks for $15—20 more than expected\nwhen dealing with utilities and other variable expenses. This will cover miscellaneous fees, prevent time-\nconsuming billing problems, and accrue as a credit. Cancel paper bank and credit card statement\ndelivery. Get bank-issued credit cards for all checking accounts— generally one for business and one for\npersonal—and set the cash advances to $0 to minimize abuse potential. Leave these cards at home, as\nthey are just for emergency overdraft protection.\n\nGive a trusted member of your family and/or your accountant power of attorney, which gives that\nperson authority to sign documents (tax filings and checks, for example) in your name. Nothing screws\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013967",
