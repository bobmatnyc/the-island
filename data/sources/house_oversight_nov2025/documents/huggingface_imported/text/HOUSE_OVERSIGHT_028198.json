We reached Camp David a little before ten at night on July 10, after\nhelicoptering from Andrews Air Force base near Washington. When we arrived, it\nwas pouring with rain. The cabin assignments were also a surprise. I was given the\none that Anwar Sadat had at the first Camp David summit in 1978. Arafat got\nMenachem Begin’s. Still, the cabins themselves, each named for a tree, were large\nand pleasant. Mine was called Dogwood. It had a bedroom, two large sitting rooms\nand a terrace. I took it as a good omen that it was the same one where Nava and I\nhad stayed during our visit with the President Clinton and Hillary right after P'd\nbecome Prime Minister.\n\nWith just eight days to address the core issues of decades of conflict, we got\ndown to work the next morning. Clinton began by meeting Arafat, as I went\nthrough the Americans’ strategy for the negotiations with Madeleine Albright,\nDennis Ross and Martin Indyk. Then I met the President in his cabin, which was\ncalled Aspen. He told me that while Arafat still thought I was trying to “trick him”\ninto an agreement, and didn’t think we’d necessarily get a deal, he did accept I was\nserious about trying. My fear was still the opposite, that Arafat was not serious.\nYet my hope was that the isolated environment of Camp David, and the wide\npublic expectation that we would accomplish what Sadat and Begin had done there\nbefore, would deliver the breakthrough that I believed ought to be possible. For\nthat to happen, I told the President, I believed it was essential that Arafat truly\nunderstood the importance of what was at stake. Not just the cost of failure, but\nwhat was potentially on offer: the creation of the Palestinian state he sought, with\nthe full acceptance of Israel and the support of the world.\n\nI wish I could say I was optimistic when Clinton led the two of us into Laurel\nLodge, the larger cabin a few hundreds downhill from Aspen, for the opening\nsession of the summit. The scene at the front door — with me bustling Arafat ahead,\nwith the intention of allowing him to enter before me — yielded the best-known\nimage from the summit. Captured by the television crews allowed into the\ncompound for the ceremonial opening, it spawned a cottage industry of political\nspeculation and armchair psychoanalysis purporting to decipher what it meant.\nSome said it was an encouraging sign of “chemistry” between me and Arafat, a not\n\n350\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028198",
