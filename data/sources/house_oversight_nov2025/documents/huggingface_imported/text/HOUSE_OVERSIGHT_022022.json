One of the concessions his lawyers have gotten\n_ while working out his plea-deal guarantees is that the media not\n' be alerted to the time and day of his departure.\n: But from now on, Epstein, who is fifty-six, will carry the\nmark of a level 3 sex offender—level 1 being the lowest, and\n| level 3 indicating the highest possible risk of a future criminal\n| act of a sexual nature. Wherever he goes, he will be forced to reg-\n“ister as such.\n; Every ninety days, Epstein will have to check in with the\nauthorities.

And for a full year, Epstein will be under\nMouse arrest in Palm Beach.\n_ This last prohibition doesn’t stop him from flying, with court\n\n’\n\n215\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022022",
