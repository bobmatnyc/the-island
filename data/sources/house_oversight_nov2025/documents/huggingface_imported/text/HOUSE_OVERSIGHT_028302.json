One of the more intriguing is taking place\njust down the road from the fair, at 2 Cornwall Terrace, part of an enormously expensive real estate\nproject being developed and sold.\n\nIn what appears to be a sophisticated way of selling both art and the property, the 18th-century\nmansion is being used as a temporary venue for an exhibition entitled The House of the Nobleman,\nOctober 15-20. The format is hybrid, both commercial and non-commercial, with 68 works on show,\nhalf of them loans from collectors — one is David Roberts, the rest are secret — the other half consisting\nof works of art for sale.\n\nThe House of the Nobleman is curated by the artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, who has teamed up with a\nyoung Russian curator, Victoria Golembiovskaya. It is backed by Mirax, a Russian real estate company\nthat has a “significant but minority” stake in the Cromwell Terrace complex. Mirax belongs to a\nRussian billionaire, Sergei Polonsky, but Mirax has been troubled since the financial recession and has\na reported $120m in debt; the firm did not respond to a request for comment. The eight houses in the\nCromwell Terrace complex are priced between £29m and £60m.\n\nVarious dealers, from the UK and elsewhere, are contributing works of art to the show; they range\nfrom two paintings by Poussin to Picasso’s “Buste d’Homme a la Pipe” (1969), priced at £3m. Banksy,\nRichter, Klein, Rodin, Cézanne and Warhol are the unlikely bedfellows in the show, which includes two\nworks by Von Lenkiewicz himself (at £60,000 and £50,000) and about 22 consigned by Charles Saatchi.\nWhile entry is free, visitors must register for admission (www.cornwallterrace.co.uk); they will be\ntaken around in groups of 50, according to the curators.\n\n22\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028302",
