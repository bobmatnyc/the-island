  "text": "undergo serious reform. It is manifestly absurd that the West makes up 12\npercent of the world’s population but takes up 60 percent of UN Security\nCouncil permanent seats. It’s nonsensical that the head of the IMF is\nalways a European and the head of the World Bank is always an American\nas the West’s share of global GDP diminishes every year. This\nconcentration of clout in the hands of a relative few has grave implications\nfor these institutions’ effectiveness and independence, making them\ninstruments of the West. No other organization, not even huge global\nNGOs like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Clinton\nFoundation, has the scope and legitimacy that the UN currently enjoys.\nFor example, the United States for years has been trying to pressure China\nto take a more proactive role in fighting climate change. Predictably,\nChina has resisted these pressures because they saw them as a clever yet\ntransparent American ruse to curtail Chinese economic growth. Only when\nthe United Nations Development Programme raised the issue with China\ndid the Chinese government take heed, as the UNDP is seen as a neutral\nparty in China. The UN and its many agencies may soon lose invaluable\ncredibility if the West insists on monopolizing its power over these\ninstitutions.\n\nAny reform of the UN should take into account three principles:\ndemocracy, recognition of power balances and the rule of law. Institutions\nof global governance can be made more democratic by ensuring that their\nleadership accurately reflects the composition of world’s population. At\nthe same time, we must also take into account geopolitical relationships\namong emerging and middle powers. Finally, the rule of law is essential to\nthe mediation and resolution of thorny international issues and to\ngoverning the conduct of states on the international stage so as to prevent\nescalation of conflict.\n\nIn this rapidly changing world, it’s a mistake to allow institutions of global\ngovernance to stay as they are. The 1945 rules-based order is no longer\nappropriate for 21st century circumstances. Global leaders must better\nprepare us for the challenges to come and equip our international\norganizations to deal with them. Leaders must find the courage to continue\nadvocating for stronger multilateral cooperation. It is time for our captains\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018215",
