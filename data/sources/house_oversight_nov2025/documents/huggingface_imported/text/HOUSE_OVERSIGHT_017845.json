Generally, these defen-\ndants fall into one of several categories: al\nQaeda and its members and associates;\nstate sponsors of terrorism; and individu-\nals and entities, including charities, banks,\nfront organizations, terrorist organizations,\nand financiers who provided financial, lo-\ngistical, and other support to al Qaeda.!\nSee, eg. Ashton Complaint 15; Burnett\nComplaint “Introduction”; Federal Com-\nplaint 1142-66. The complaints assert\nsubject matter jurisdiction under the For-\neign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”),\n28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seg; and causes of\naction under the Torture Victim Protection\nAct (““TVPA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1850 note; the\nAntiterrorism Act (“ATA”), 18 U.S.C.\n\n1. According to Plaintiffs, Osama bin Laden\nformed al Qaeda, which means “the Base” or\n“the Vanguard,” into an international terror-\nist organization with the aim of violently op-\nposing non-Islam governments and Islamic\nstates too beholden to the West. See, e.g.,\nBurnett Complaint at 275.\n\n2. Before the Multidistrict Panel transferred\nBurnett v. Al Baraka Inv. & Dev. Corp., 02 Civ.\n1616, to this Court, Judge Robertson of the\nUnited States District Court for the District of\nColumbia dismissed the claims against Prince\nSultan relating to acts performed in his offi-\ncial capacity for lack of subject matter juris-\ndiction. Burnett v. Al Baraka Inv. & Dev.\nCorp. 292 FSupp.2d 9, 23 (D.D.C.2003)\n(hereinafter “Burnett IT’). Finding that the\ncourt lacked personal jurisdiction over Prince\nSultan, Judge Robertson dismissed without\nprejudice the allegations concerning acts tak-\nen in his personal, as opposed to official,\ncapacity. Id. Judge Robertson dismissed the\ncomplaint against Prince Turki for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction as well. Id.\n\nPrince Sultan and Prince Turki both move\nto dismiss the complaints against them in\nAshton v. Al Qaeda Islamic Army, 02 Civ.\n6977 (S.D.N.Y.); Barrera v. Al Qaeda Islamic\nArmy, 03 Civ. 7036 (S.D.N.Y.); Burnett v. Al\nBaraka Inv. & Dev. Corp., 02 Civ. 1616\n(D.D.C.); Burnett v. Al Baraka Inv. & Dev.\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\n§ 2331 et seq; the Alien Tort Claims Act\n(“ATCA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1350; the Racke-\nteer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\nAct (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq;\ntheories of aiding and abetting, conspiracy,\nintentional infliction of emotional distress,\nnegligence, survival, wrongful death, tres-\npass, and assault and battery.\n\n[1] Several motions to dismiss are\npending before the Court. At the sugges-\ntion of counsel, the Court scheduled oral\narguments in groups organized generally\nby grounds for dismissal. On September\n14, 2004, the Court heard oral argument\non the motions to dismiss for lack of sub-\nject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA by\nHRH Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud\n(“Prince Sultan”), HRH Prince Turki Al-\nFaisal bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud (“Prince\nTurki”), and the National Commercial\n\nCorp., 03 Civ. 5738 (S.D.N.Y.); Salvo v. Al\nQaeda Islamic Army, 03 Civ. 5071 (S.D.N.Y.);\nand Tremsky v. Osama bin Laden, 02 Civ.\n7300 (S.D.N.Y.). Plaintiffs in these cases filed\nconsolidated responses to Prince Sultan’s and\nPrince Turki’s motions. In Plaintiffs’ words,\nthe New York Burnett action is materially\nidentical to the D.C. Burnett action and was\nfiled as a “prophylactic’’ measure in the event\nthe D.C. court found that it lacked subject\nmatter jurisdiction. Burnett Complaint at\n265. Additionally, at Plaintiffs’ counsel re-\nquest, this Court ordered the Barrera action\nconsolidated with the Ashton case on Decem-\nber 6, 2004.\n\nPrince Sultan and Prince Turki have each\nalso filed a separate motion to dismiss in\nFederal Insurance v. Al Qaida, 03 Civ. 6978\n(S.D.N.Y.), both of which are fully submitted\nand are resolved in this opinion. The Federal\nInsurance Plaintiffs are forty-one insurance\ncompanies that have paid and reserved claims\nin excess of $4.5 billion as a result of the\nSeptember 11 attacks.\n\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs filed a motion for\nreconsideration in conjunction with Prince\nSultan’s and Prince Turki’s motions to dis-\nmiss certain consolidated complaints. While\nthis Court reviews and gives deference to\nJudge Robertson’s thoughtful opinion, it must\nevaluate Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017845",
