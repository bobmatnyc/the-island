  "text": "Wayfair (Neutral, $44 PO)\n\nStock view: Timeline on profitability still an issue, but comps ease in 2Q’17\nWayfair’s two issues have been deceleration in U.S. revenue growth and negative\noperating margins as the company continues to aggressively invest in logistics,\ninternational expansion, marketing, and new categories. 1Q customer and order growth\ncomps remain tough, which was one of the drivers of revenue growth guidance below\nexpectations. Wayfair also attributed weak guidance to caution on the retail\nenvironment and added investment. Growth comps ease in 2Q/3Q, and there is potential\nfor more stable growth in 2Q guidance to drive improving investor sentiment.\n\nAs for margins, management guided to EBITDA margin of (3.5%)-(3.8%), a deceleration\nfrom (2.8%) in 1Q’16 due to a lower opex absorption in the quarter on seasonally lower\nsales. The US is expected to swing back to EBITDA losses in 1Q’17, while Intl losses are\nexpected to remain steady. We forecast EBITDA margin of (2.4%), with (0.2%) EBITDA\nmargin in the US and (19.0%) margin in International. The company continues to expect\nlittle to no ad spend leverage given increase International ad spend.\n\nManagement historically builds conservativism into its guidance and, until last year, had\na track record of beating the upper end of its sales outlook by ~10%. Recently, revenue\nhas been by a low-single digit percentage. Our above consensus 1Q revenue forecast\nimplies 1% upside to the high end of the guidance range, in line with the trend over the\npast 3 quarters. We think investors expect sales growth above the guidance range as\nwell.\n\nTable 27: Revenue and EBITDA Guidance vs. Actuals\n4Q14 1015 2015 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2016 3Q16 4Q16 1Q17E**\n\nRevenue - High End of Guidance $370,000 $390,000 $440,000 $525,000 $665,000 $700,000 $785,000 $850,000 $960,000 $930,000\nRevenue Actual $408,619  $424.371 $491,752 $593,972 739,790 TAT 348 786,928 861,525 984,559 943.626\nRevenue Upside $38,619 $34,371 $51,752 $68,972 $74,790 $47 348 $1,928 $11,525 $24,559 $13,626\nRevenue % Upside 10% 9% 12% 13% 11% 1% 0% 1% 3% 1%\nEBITDA - High End of Guidance % 4.5% -3.5% -2.5% -0.8% -0.8% -3.0% -3.2% 4.3% -2.8% -3.5%\nEBITDA - High End of Guidance ($16,650) ($13,650) ($11,000) ($3,938) ($4,988) ($21,000) = ($25,120) ($36,125) ($26,400) = ($32,550)\nEBITDA Actual ($7,218) — ($12,340) ($4,972) (51,445) $2,828 ($20,960) ($24,857) ($80,849) = ($12,026) ($22,463)\"\nEBITDA Upside $9,432 $1,310 $6,028 $2,493 $7,816 $40 $263 $5,276 $14,374 $10,087\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Wayfair\nNote: * 1Q17E Actuals are current BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts\n\nOver the past two quarters, Wayfair has expressed caution on the macro environment,\nthough this proved to be somewhat unwarranted in 4Q. According to February 2017\naggregated BAC credit and debit card data, furniture sales were up 1.3% (down 0.4% on\nrolling 3-month m/m basis), while home goods were down 1.2% y/y and flat on a rolling\n3 month m/m basis. Please see the BofA Merrill Lynch US Economics team's report for\nadditional commentary on broader retail trends and a detailed explanation of the\nmethodology and limitations in connection with BAC data. Williams-Sonoma reported\ndisappointing 4Q earnings (March 15* report) and provided modest 1Q guidance that\nthe BofA Merrill Lynch Hardline Retail team called “a little rich,” though it is difficult to\ntell if weak trends are the result of secular home goods weakness or the disruptive\nimpact of eCommerce players like Wayfair.\n\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: 2Q revenue guidance on easier y/y comps\n\n1Q revenue guidance was a disappointment, though comps ease in 2Q’17, and\nopportunity for more stable US growth could aid stock sentiment. Customer growth in\n2Q has a 400bps easier y/y comp vs 1Q17, while order growth has a 1700bps easier y/y\ncomp. Overall, revenue growth faces a 1600bps easier y/y comp. and would expect\nguidance anywhere near the Street’s 2Q estimate at 25% y/y growth to be viewed\npositively given several quarters of guidance below street estimates.\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 41\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014927",
