  "text": "a\n\nThe dining hall around us was dark as Nan finished his discussion that night. At our\ntable we sat in a pool of dim light and waited on the Master as he considered his\nnext thoughts. I knew that some of what drew China’s great minds here to dinners\nwith him was a sense that those old ideas of Chinese philosophy - born in an age of\nchaos and dating back to a time before rational calculation and scientific progress -\noffered hope. I asked Master Nan where he would begin on a quest to understand\nthis age and how best to prepare. How to cultivate oneself?\n\n“You know you can’t just understand this easily,” Master Nan said sharply. He was a\nlittle angry with me, I could see, for asking such a direct question - and he was also\nusing the Chinese teaching technique of taking students through a range of emotions\nto accelerate their learning. Chinese philosophers believe we learn differently\ndepending on how we feel, so a teacher making a student scared or insulted or\nproud is often just an educational tactic. Nan was working on my humiliation bone\nnow: “This isn’t like some idea I can sell you and then you can just go and use,” he\ncontinued, his voice rising. “This is going to be hard.”\n\nMaster Nan inhaled on his cigarette and waited a moment. “If you work, though,\nmaybe you can be like Su Qin,” he said, “the man who wrestled 20 years of peace out\nof 300 years of war.” Su Qin was the hero of the Warring States period during which\nChina collapsed into total chaos. He is remembered today, two thousand years later,\nfor the way he had penetrated the madness of his age and how he found there\ndeeper fibers of truth that he lashed into a stable peace. “Su Qin started as an\nidealist. He failed.\n\n“You know, Su Qin was humiliated in trying to advise kings. Even his kin were\nembarrassed. His sister and mother refused to let him return to the family home. He\nwas in so much pain over this embarrassment that he sat in front of a desk and read\nevery book of history he could find for seven years. He tied his long hair to a beam\nabove his desk so that if he fell asleep it would hold his head up. Sometimes he\nwould stab a knife into his thigh to keep awake.” Nan’s voice was rising, his speech\npicking up pace. “But in the end, he learned. Su Qin learned. You should study him. If\nyou do this, if you are sincere, if you work hard, if you learn these ideas, you can\nunderstand. Can you be that disciplined?” The room was dead quiet now. No one\nlooked at me. In the silence, one of the guests passed around a plate of cut fresh fruit\nand cherries and sweet dried dates.\n\nNan’s relentless, intense Ch’an Buddhism sort of enlightenment, delivered only after\npainful years of carbon-crushing intellectual intensity, expressed a clear ambition:\nTo learn to feel through invisible relations and balances and to construct something\npromising and hopeful on the other side. Nan’s long sessions of mediation or sword\nplay, his furious pursuing philosophical dialogues that reduced students to an\nembarrassed sweating state, these were all aimed at sharpening a blade so as to\ninstantly carve at the energy flows of our age. Did “spiritual illness” really linger\nahead of us? What sort of tragedy did that suggest? What was it that, hair tied to the\n\n11\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018243",
