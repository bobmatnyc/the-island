The Trump \nadministration is keen to host \nModi. But South Block is look-\ning at the potential deliverables \nfrom such a visit, particularly \non H1B visas. The Indian PM's \npolitical stature has increased \nmanifold after his recent elec-\ntoral successes, while Trump's \npresidential tenure has moved \nfrom one problem to another. \nDelhi doesn't want Modi to \ninvest his substantial political \ncapital to help Trump burnish \nhis image, without the visit \nyielding positive results for the \nIndian side. Modi is scheduled \nto visit New York to attend the \nUN General Assembly in \nSeptember. But, the Trump-\nModi telephonic conversation \nhas indicated to South Block, \nand to those who look at foreign \npolicy issues within the \nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP), \nthat the Trump administration \nis keen to host the Indian PM \nfor a bilateral visit in the next \ncouple of months. \nEarlier this month, Foreign \nSecretary S Jaishankar, accom-\npanied by Commerce Secretary \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi \nRita Teaotia, was in the US. Last \nweek, National Security Advisor \nAjit Kumar Doval was also on a \nvisit to the US. External Affairs \nMinister Sushma Swaraj and US \nSecretary of State Rex W \nUS President Donald Trump \nTillerson had also recently spo-\nken over the phone. \nIn his phone call, Trump \ncongratulated Modi on his \nrecent state election victories, \nexpressed support for his eco-\nnomic reforms and said he had \ngreat respect for Indians, and \nsaid he looked forward to host-\ning the PM later this year. \nThe window for such a visit is \navailable in May, as well as in \nJune after the PM attends the \nShanghai Cooperation Organ-\nisation Summit in Kazakhstan \nin the second week.The PM's US \nvisit could take place before his \nvisit to Hamburg, in Germany, to \nattend the G20 Summit on July \n7-8, and his bilateral visit to Israel \naround that time. \nIt will be the first-ever visit of \nan Indian PM to Israel. The \nhighlight of his policy changes \nwill be the PM's outreach to the \nIndian diaspora there. Israel has \n85,000 Jews of Indian origin. \nJews are an influential commu-\nnity in the US, and some of \nthese groups had engaged with \nModi even during his time as \nthe Gujarat chief minister. \nAccording to a source, Modi's \nvisit to the US before Tel Aviv \ncould help the PM engage with \nthe Jewish community there, \nwhich would contribute to the \nsuccess of his Israel visit. \nOn Tuesday, the Indo-\nAmerican Chamber of \nCommerce urged an early visit \nof the PM to the US to \"sort out \nthe apprehensions\" of the Indian \nindustry on the negative impact \nof tightening of visa rules relat-\ning to H1B and Li visas.",
