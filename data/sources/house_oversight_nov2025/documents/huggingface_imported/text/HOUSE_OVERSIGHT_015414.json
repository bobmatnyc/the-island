  "text": "“You’ re hilarious. If you ever apologize to a heckler again | will rape\nyou.” Louis C.K.: “Your show makes me laugh every time | watch it. And\nyou have pretty eyes” --except that he wrote it after watching Tosh on TV,\nbut before he learned about the Laugh Factory incident. Nevertheless, he\nwas excoriated and accused of being a “rape apologist.” But C.K. himself\nis no stranger to sexual-assault jokes. Onstage, he has said that he’ s\nagainst rape-- “unless you have a reason, like you wanna fuck someone\n\nand they won’ t let you, in which case what other option do you have?”\n\nConversely, in an episode of his TV series, Lou/e, he reversed such\nroles. After leaving a bar with an especially aggressive woman, Laurie\n(played by Melissa Leo), that he had inadvertently met earlier, she\nperforms fellatio on him in her pickup truck, then insists that he in turn\nperform cunnilingus on her. And he refuses. So, she attacks him physically\nwith unabashed viciousness, mounts him, and he gives in to her\ndemand. In other words, Laurie rapes Louie. No joke. To watch this scene\nwas positively jaw-dropping. It served as a reminder of how often\ncomedians--and their jaded audiences--find prison-rape jokes not only to\nbe funny, but also, as in the case of pedophile Jerry Sandusky, an act of\ndelayed justice resulting in laughter that morphs into applause. A VY. Post\n\nheadline about pedophile Subway pitchman: “Enjoy a foot long in jail.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015414",
