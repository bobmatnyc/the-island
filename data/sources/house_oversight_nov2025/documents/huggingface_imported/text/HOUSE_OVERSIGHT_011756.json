  "text": "I suspect Amnon would have said much the same thing. But that wasn’t the\nquestion he’d been asked. As the proceedings wound down, Peres looked glum.\nMaybe he was anticipating the potential leaks of army concerns about a Golan\nwithdrawal if we did get closer to a deal, and the venomous political attacks he\ncould expect from the right. Bibi’s stated view on a deal with Syria at the time\nwas that we could get peace and keep the Golan. It was classic Bibi, spoken\nwith verve and conviction as if simply saying it would make it true.\n\nWhen the presentation was over, Peres called us into a small room in the\nbunker reserved for use by the Defense Minister. As Foreign Minister, I was the\nonly cabinet member with him — along with Uri Savir, Peres’s senior deputy for\npeace negotiations and several other Peres aides. If there had been a discussion,\nI would have told him that as long as he felt the talks were progressing, he could\nignore Amnon’s presentation. If we didn’t get a deal, it would be irrelevant. If\nwe did, the military could find ways to deal with the security issues. But he just\nlooked at us and said” “We’re going for elections.” A few days later, the date\nwas set for May 29, 1996. Yet that would turn out not to be the end of Peres’s\ndoubts or difficulties. It was only the beginning.\n\n285\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011756",
