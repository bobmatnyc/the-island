  "text": "Birth. They told me that, paraphrasing Paul in Romans, they had been saved and\nwere living New Life, not earned by good works as in Hebraic Law, but by faith\nthrough God’s Grace. Jesus had “paid their bills’ through His sacrifice at\nGethsemane. They both tried to explain inexplicable feelings of new energy, the\nunseen hand of spiritual guidance and peace. One told me that the wind of the Holy\nGhost had taken him to the front of the pulpit, tearfully, thankfully, on his knees, to\naccept Jesus as his personal Savior. They described how they had opened their\nlives to the spiritual strength of /iving in Jesus.\n\nMany things about them changed: their tastes in food, from hamburgers to\nvegetables and fruit; from the jazz of John Coltrane and McCoy Tyner and the\ncynicism of Frank Zappa’s “...only fourteen and knows how to nasty...,” to playing\nstrum guitar and singing the hymns of Wednesday night healing services; from t-\nshirts hanging out of raggedy, Southern California, boutique store purchased,\nstressed jeans, to polished dark shoes, starched white shirts and gray or tan khaki\nslacks, sometimes with ties. They became cool, respectful, rational and more\ndistant with me. They repeated often the scriptural story about young Jesus,\naccidentally separated from his parents on a visit to Jerusalem. When by standers\nasked Him about where His parents were, He answered, “| have no mother and\nfather.” They told me that they, like God’s son Jesus, were filled to completeness\nwith the Father and the Holy Ghost.\n\nOn one hand, their experiences sounded like those of the activated mind\nstate of Abraham Abulafia, a suddenly emergent Nevesh and my father’s\nmetaphysical talks about personal transformation. My personal secular-\ncomputational brain God spoke to me of the mechanisms of sudden personality\nchange, a phase transition in complex systems, in the context of the nonlinear\ndynamics of brain and behavior. On the other hand, their global changes in mind felt\nboth alien and threatening. When | came to learn their churches’ full list of\nexpectations, rules, requirements and sociopolitical policies, | found that | could not\nidentify with this system of spiritual knowing at all. It felt rigid, righteous, unforgiving,\neven angry, and it frightened me. | never anticipated that my culturally enriched,\n\nintellectually sophisticated sons would be quoting Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.\n\n123\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013623",
