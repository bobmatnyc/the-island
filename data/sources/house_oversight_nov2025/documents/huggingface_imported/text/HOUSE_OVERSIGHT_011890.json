  "text": "/ BARAK / 133\n\nthe heads of military intelligence and Mossad, to sign off on the operational\nviability of the plan.\n\nThat was what now ended any prospect of military action, at least for a few\nmonths. Bibi, Lieberman and I withdrew into a side room to talk with the chief of\nstaff, Gaby Ashkenazi, as well as the heads of military intelligence, the Mossad\nand and Shin Bet. We emphasized that no final decision on whether to attack had\nbeen taken. That would require a further meeting with the Group of Eight, and then\nthe full cabinet. But we asked each of them for their views on the operation. We\nknew they had political reservations, along the lines of those voiced by Dan\nMeridor. On an issue of this magnitude, it was accepted practice that military and\nintelligence commanders could weigh in on the political implications as well. But\ntheir formal role was operational and professional. Ashkenazi and the other\ngenerals did concede that in every area — planning, materiel, training and\nintelligence — our attack plan was far ahead of where it had been a year earlier. Yet\nAshkenazi, in particular, concluded that the preparations had not yet “crossed the\nthreshold of operational capability”.\n\nI was furious. I respected the considered opposition of ministers like Dan or\nBenny Begin. I had no problem with the chief-of-staff or other generals expressing\nsimilar views on the political or geo-strategic implications of an Israeli attack, even\nthough our intelligence assessments suggested the concerns were almost certainly\nunfounded. Yet what I found astonishing was Ashkenazi’s suggestion that the\n“operational threshold” had not been crossed. Yes, this would be a demanding\nmission. It was not without risks. No operation was. But having followed every\nstage and detail of the preparations — and as a former chief of staff and intelligence\nchief myself — I believed it was simply wrong on a professional level to say that\nwe lacked the capacity, and a workable plan, for a military strike if the order was\ngiven.\n\nAshkenazi’s objection did mean there was no way we were going to attack at\nleast until well into the new year. Our discussions would continue, as would our\nrefinement and strengthening of the attack plan. So would Iran’s progress toward\nits “zone of immunity,” which we now believed would begin late in 2012, a couple\nof years away. As that point drew closer, we’d face an ever-more-pressing need to\ndecide finally whether military action was necessary.\n\n419\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011890",
