I turn down most celebrity requests, and cases involving celebrity clients form a tiny\nfraction of my practice over the years, but the few that I do take garner far more publicity than do\nthe many cases involving unknown clients.\n\nIs there anything special about famous clients—celebrities? Should “high profile” cases be\nhandled differently from less visible controversies? These are questions I have pondered during\nmy career as a lawyer.\n\nMost people see celebrities at a distance — on the screen, stage, television, athletic field, or\nauditorium. They see them at their best — acting, posing, playing, speaking, being interviewed or\nparticipating in charitable causes.\n\nI see celebrities close up and at their worst. They come to me when they are in trouble, often\ndeep trouble. Their celebrity is no longer a shield protecting them from the ordinary tribulations\nthat befall most people on a daily basis. When they come to me, their celebrity has been turned\ninto a sword being wielded against them. Celebrities generally live by publicity. When they come\nto me, they are dying from the publicity and want privacy and anonymity. But they can’t have it,\nbecause the very celebrity that brought them fame and fortune now threatens to magnify their\nproblems.\n\nI have represented, advised and consulted with dozens of celebrities, ranging from Presidents and\nPrime Ministers to world famous athletes, actors, writers and financiers. Most have gotten into\ntrouble for one overarching reason: because they were willing to risk what they have limited\namounts of in order to obtain more of what they have unlimited amounts of.\n\nThis may sound self-defeating, if not bizarre—so let me explain. Celebrities share several\ncommon characteristics. They have more of something than ordinary people have: great athletes\nhave extraordinary physical skills; good actors have unusual thespian skills; successful politicians\nhave a special charisma; financiers have money and the ability to make more. These special\ncharacteristics generally give celebrities access to certain desiderata of life: lots of money and the\nthings money and fame buy, and the benefits that come with these commodities, such as access to\nnumerous sexual partners — if they choose to use their celebrity to obtain such access (and\nexcess!)\n\nMany of my celebrity clients, who have unlimited amounts of money or access to sex, have\nsacrificed what they have limited amounts of — freedom, career, time with loved ones, health — in\norder to obtain even more money or sex. Let me provide a few examples of such bizarre risk-\ntaking in cases that are a matter of public record. (I could provide many more examples if I were\nfree — which I am not — to disclose confidential information given to me by celebrity clients)*’.\n\nLeona Hemsley, the celebrity hotel “queen”, had more than a billion dollars in the bank when,\naccording to the government, she whited out the words “stereo system” on a bill for services and\nchanged them to “security system” in order to have her accountant deduct its cost from her taxes.\n\n® See Larry David’s “Buckner” episode on Curb Your Enthusiasm, where a psychiatrist tells Larry about his\ncelebrity patients, without disclosing the names, while identifying them by unique characteristics: e.g., a well\nknown film director who directed Star Wars.\n\n261\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017348",
