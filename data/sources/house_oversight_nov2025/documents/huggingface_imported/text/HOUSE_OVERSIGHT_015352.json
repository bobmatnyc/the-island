  "text": "involuntary shit eating, and what we’ re talking about here is the\nvoluntary kind.\n\nFor many years | heard stories that comic actor Danny Thomas, the\nstar of Make Room for Daddy, was a coprophagiac. | assumed it was just\nanother urban legend until | bumped into an old friend who was now\nworking as a prostitute in Hollywood. Over lunch, she mentioned the\nnames of some of her celebrity clients, including Danny Thomas. She told\nme how he had hired her to save her solid waste in her panties so that he\ncould rub those panties on his face and gobble up her shit as though it\nwere cotton candy.\n\nWhen he finished, he would wash his hands and face thoroughly\nthen pay her and, as if coming out of a trance, he’ dsay, “Where was |?”\nHe was trying to distance himself from what he had just done. Instant\ndenial. Since then, | have believed that Danny Thomas’ s fundraising for\nSaint Jude’ s Hospital was really for the purpose of having secret access to\ntheir bedpans.\n\nAnyway, |! googled “eating shit.” Topping the list was “Shit Eating\nGrins: In Defense of Adam Sandler.” But sure enough, | was soon led to\nhardcore shit-eating sites, which | found totally disgusting, yet absolutely\n\nriveting. You may not want to read any further, but we both know you will.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015352",
