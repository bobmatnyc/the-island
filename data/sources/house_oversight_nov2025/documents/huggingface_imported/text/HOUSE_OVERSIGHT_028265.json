In the early months, my priority was to\nensure we at least had a military option. A full year before joining Bibi’s\ngovernment, as Defense Minister under Olmert, I’d first tried to put an operational\nplan in place, only to find that the lack of heavy munitions and refuelling aircraft\nmade it impossible. That was especially frustrating because at that point, our\nexperts calculated that a successful strike could have set back the Iranian nuclear\neffort by about six years. Given the Iranians’ knowledge we could attack again,\nand their need to restart clandestine efforts to secure key components abroad, that\nmeant a very real prospect of ending the nuclear program altogether. On joining\nBibi’s government, I began working, both with the kirya and the engineers and\ntechnological experts in our military industries, to make sure we had the weaponry\nand equipment, and an operational plan for a surgical strike. It was not until mid-\n2010, a year into Bibi’s government, that I was confident we’d reached that point,\nin part thanks to Israeli-produced heavy bombs and tanker aircraft. Our experts\nestimated we would still be able to set back the Iranian nuclear efforts by up to\nfour years, almost certainly enough to end them indefinitely.\n\nYet making military action possible proved to be the easy part. The question\nnow became whether we should be prepared to launch a strike against Iran’s\nnuclear facilities. Answering it was like a contest of three-dimensional chess,\ninvolving both an internal debate among Israel’s political and military leadership\nand discussions with an Obama administration whose priority remained to\nnegotiate an end to Iran’s nuclear program. On major security decisions in Israel,\ntwo ministers always mattered the most: the Prime Minister and Defense Minister.\nNeither Bibi nor I doubted we had to ready to strike if that proved necessary. Nor\ndid Foreign Minister Lieberman. Even for us, it was an option to be considered\nonly when all other ways to rein in the Iranians were failing. We also agreed on\ntwo other preconditions. We would have to secure international legitimacy, most of\nall from the Americans, for what would be a clear act of self-defense. And we’d\nneed to demonstrate an imperative urgency to act, with the approach of the “zone\nof immunity” that would take any military option off the table for good.\n\nIdeally, we hoped the US-led campaign of economic and diplomatic pressure\nwould get Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, as Libya had done in the wake of\n\n417\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028265",
