  "text": "Conclusions: 100-Year Review of USA Inc. Income Statement\n\n* America’s government has grown dramatically - USA Inc.’s revenue as percent of\nGDP has risen from 2% to 15%. Individual / social insurance (Social Security +\nMedicare) taxes have risen dramatically while customs / excise / estate taxes\nhave declined in relative importance. In addition, USA Inc.’s spending as percent\nof GDP has risen to 24% in 2010, up from 3% average between 1790 and 1930.\n\n¢ USA Inc.’s average operating income was at or near breakeven for most of the\nperiods from 1910 to 1970.\n\nIn the 1970s, as healthcare expenses (related to Medicare and Medicaid) began\nto surge, USA Inc. reported more frequent — and bigger — losses. Since 1970,\nUSA Inc. showed a profit just 4 times (F1998-F2001, when economic growth was\nespecially robust and defense spending was relatively low).\n\n¢ General expense trends since 1970: non-defense discretionary spending has\nbeen flattish (except in recessions with material one-time charges), healthcare\nspending (largely Medicare + Medicaid) has risen materially, Social Security\nspending has been flattish, defense spending has been down to flattish, and\ninterest payments varied with interest rates.\n\nKP\ni USA Inc. | Income Statement Drilldown 61\n\nOperations of USA Inc. Are Solid,\n\nExcluding Medicare / Medicaid and One-Time Charges\n\nRevenues of USA Inc. (largely from individual and corporate income and\npayroll taxes) can fund most expenses (largely spending on defense,\nSocial Security, unemployment insurance, education, law enforcement,\ntransportation, energy, infrastructure, federal employee & veteran\nbenefits, and interest payments).\n\nIn fact, for USA Inc.'s operations besides Medicare / Medicaid and\none-time expenses, there’s ample scope to increase spending for\ndefense, education, law enforcement, transportation, infrastructure\nand energy by ~4%* in aggregate and still remain break-even.\n\nNote: *Excluding Medicare / Medicaid revenue & expenses, USA Inc.’s expenses are, on average, 4% below revenue levels\nP from F1996 to F2010 based on our calculation of White House OMB data.\n(@E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | Income Statement Drilldown 62\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020872",
