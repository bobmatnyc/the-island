Robert Maxwell's daughter\nk as E i\n\ninvited her to ersonal masseuse soon after her 15th birthday\nWe kissed on the cheek and Ghislaine placed me on his other knee.’ Johanna spoke to The Mail on\nSunday three years ago about this incident, which took place when she was 21.\n\nShe said: ‘Ghislaine put the puppet’s hand on Virginia's breast, then Andrew put his hand on my\nbreast. It was a great joke. Everybody laughed.’ After this, Virginia was paid, by Epstein, around\n$400 (£250).’\n\nShe met Andrew for the third and final time on Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little Saint James.\nVirginia was never under the British legal age of consent when she met Andrew. She was 17 during\nthe first two encounters and 18 at the third.\n\nBy now, however, Epstein, had started to hint that she was getting ‘too old’ for him.\n\nBut during one trip to the island, Epstein and Ghislaine made their most astonishing proposition, and\none which repulsed her. ‘They said Jeffrey wanted me to have his child,’ she says.\n\n‘They said | was part of their family and | was beautiful,young, loyal and nurturing and would be a\ngreat mother.\n\nThey said | would have to sign a contract relinquishing rights to the child and consenting to Jeffrey\nhaving as many relationships as he liked. In return | would have my own mansion in Palm Beach\nand a large monthly payment, a percentage of his income.’\n\nThis, finally, was a wake-up call to Virginia and she began to see the way in which she had been\ngroomed.\n\n‘It was a smack in the face,’ she says. ‘I finally realised this wasn’t ever going to be a real\nrelationship but | knew if | refused, I'd be thrown back on the streets. So | said, “I'm too yaung. |\nwant to get my massage credentials, then maybe we'll do it”.’\n\nThe tycoon took her at her word and, for her 19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to Thailand\nwhere he enrolled her in a massage course.\n\nShortly after arriving there, she met an Australian martial arts expert called Robert. They fell in love\nand, just ten days later, married in a Buddhist ceremony.\n\n‘| cailed Jeffrey and told him I'd fallen madly in love,’ Virginia says. ‘| was hoping he’d be delighted.\nBut he said, “Have a nice life,” and hung up on me.’ The couple now have two sons, aged five and\nfour, and a daughter who recently turned one.\n\n‘The first few months ajter | married Robert were the worst,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t bring myself to tell\nhim much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out.\n\n‘I felt very alone. | was having panic attacks and seeing a psychiatrist and was on anti-depressants.\n\n‘ Virginia was beginning to put her Epstein days behind her when, three years ago, she was phoned\nby the FBI.\n\nhttp:/Avww.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361039/Prince-Andrew-girl-17-sex-offender-friend-flew-Britain-meet-him html\n\nL:1SECROTR SH RIV’.
