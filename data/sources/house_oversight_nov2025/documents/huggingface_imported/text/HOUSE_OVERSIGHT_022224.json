  "text": "Your daily beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites against you in the same way that we try to\ndepromote you.\n\nAs far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you\nhave no interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the latter, and\nyou stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, and it will return to the old form. The major work\nhas been done, but it needs to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have constant input and\nsupervision, and that means generating proper content, not just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers need to\nknow what to write.

Please let me know what you want to do. I need to inform him, and\nif you are not going to use him, he needs to take on his other clients and devote his time there.\n\nThis needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search on your name, which had nine/10\nvery toxic prominent stories, and toxic Wiki article and headline.\n\nSearch Results\n1.
