  "text": "points) or more or less regular cycles. We analyze our “fixed point” data using\nquantities such as the mean and variance of distributional statistics and the cycle\ndata using the amplitude, frequency, cycle length and phase of trigonometric\nfunctions. In central tendency-oriented research, rare, very high amplitude events\nhave usually been considered aberrations and tossed, and imperfect periodic\nbehavior is treated by “cosiner analysis” as regular cycles contaminated by\nmeasurement or system noise. Whereas technically, chaotic dynamics must live in\ndimension greater than two (for orbits to be more than a fixed point or limit cycle,\nable to snake around without necessarily intersecting ), the Lorenz attractor has\ndimension just a little over two, our difficulties with establishing the “true”\nphysiological dimension of real biological observables (see below) makes such a\n\nconsideration more theoretical than practical.\n\nThe orbits of a forced-dissipative dynamical system in a parameter regime\nengendering chaos, converge onto an attractor which is neither a fixed point nor a\nlimit cycle, thus the origin of the name “strange attractor” (Ruelle and Takens,\n1971). It was James Yorke that first named these dynamics “chaos” (Li and Yorke,\n1975). The necessarily statistical properties of the chaotic orbits on strange\nattractors follow from the generic characteristics of their motions (see Shaw, 1981\nfor a still conceptually current, non-mathematical treatment). These kinds of\nstatistics are studied in a research context called the “ergodic theory of dynamical\nsystems” (Ruelle, 1979; Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985). Ergodic is a word used to\ncharacterize a system with (or without) a particular condition placed on its statistical\nmeasures: the existence of an invariant measure which is undecomposabile into\ntwo invariant measures and, equivalently (though not obviously) one in which the\ntime average equals its average in the geometric space into which it is embedded.\nOne may arrive at the same ergodic measure from studying a single very long orbit\nor from summing across many individual but shorter orbits. This ergodic\nequivalence is made possible due to the definitional existence of at least one\ninvariant statistical measure and the dynamics of the system which ideally include a\n\nuniformly, sequence disordering process called “mixing” (see below).\n\n201\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013701",
