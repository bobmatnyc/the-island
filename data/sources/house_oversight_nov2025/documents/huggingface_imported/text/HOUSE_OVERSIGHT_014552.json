Baily and Montalbano\nsuggest that increased regulation after the crisis\nmay be partially responsible for the widening gap\nbetween frontier firms and the rest of the industry,\nwhich lowers overall productivity growth rates\nacross the economy and hence lowers the pace of\neconomic growth.\n\nOur colleagues in GIR think that lower capital\ninvestment accounts for the lack of diffusion of\nnew technologies from more productive firms to\nless productive firms.** Here, again, it is likely that\na more favorable business environment could have\nboosted capital expenditures and increased overall\nproductivity levels.\n\nWe conclude that it is reasonable to assign\nsome of the weakness in this recovery to less\neffective fiscal and regulatory policies out of\nWashington rather than to structural shortcomings\nin the US economy.\n\nA Steady Onslaught of External Shocks\n\nA sixth theory posits that numerous external\nshocks explain the slow pace of this recovery.\n\nJust as the US economy was recovering from the\ntrough of 2009, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis\njolted global financial markets. The Eurozone\n\nwas a source of uncertainty and financial market\nvolatility beyond the initial shock in 2010 as the\n\ncrisis spread from Greece to Spain and Italy.\n\nThe Eurozone crisis was followed by a series\nof what the Brookings Institution has called the\n“fiscal fights of the Obama administration.” The\nfirst fiscal fight resulted in the Standard and Poor’s\n(S&P) downgrade of US Treasury debt in August\n2011. The equity markets, as measured by the S&P\n500 Index, dropped about 19% between April and\nOctober of 2011.\n\nTaken together, the Eurozone sovereign debt\ncrisis and the first of the fiscal fights tightened\nUS financial conditions*®® by 142 basis points (see\nExhibit 18). GIR estimates that a 100 basis point\ntightening of financial conditions is equivalent to a\nfederal funds hike of 150 basis points and a drag\non GDP growth of about one percentage point.\n\nThe drop in oil prices from a post-crisis high\nof $107 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate\nin June 2014 to a trough of $26 per barrel in\nFebruary 2016 also provided a shock to the\neconomy. Employment and capital expenditures\nin the oil and gas sector dropped by 29% and\n67%, respectively, from peak levels seen in 2014.\nThe sector’s par-weighted default rate excluding\ndistressed exchanges reached 14.6% and including\nsuch exchanges 19.8%, in October 2016.°!\n\nBroad-based fear of policy mistakes in China\nand unexpected depreciation of the renminbi were\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014552",
