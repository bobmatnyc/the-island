  "text": "86\n\nthe emails identified himself as a privacy advocate, which was also how Greenwald often\nidentified himself in his speeches. He also echoed other concerns Greenwald had publicly\nexpressed including defending American privacy from government intrusions.\n\nSnowden promised the leaks he would supply would provide dramatic results. He asserted in\nhis email that the “shock” of the documents he would give Greenwald would result in the public’s\nlearning about the secret “mechanisms through which our privacy is violated.” According to\nSnowden’s assessment, following that initial uproar, they could achieve another objective in their\ncommon cause. “We can guarantee for all people equal protection against unreasonable search,”\nhe wrote. In light of this convergence of views, it is not surprising that Greenwald was fully\nconvinced of Citizen 4’s bona fides. He said to Poitras, “He’s real,” and he agreed to help break\nthe story in the Guardian.\n\nAfter he said he was onboard the project, Poitras revealed to Greenwald that Citizen 4 would\ndeliver an entire trove of secret documents to them in six to eight weeks. According to this\ntimetable, the Greenwald’s scoop, and the “shock” Citizen 4 promised, would come in early to\nmid June 2013.\n\nAt this point in late April, Snowden was in full control. Although his day job at Dell involved\nendlessly monitoring largely-meaningless encrypted numbers in the NSA tunnel, he had been able\nto get three major journalists to react favorably to his proposal. None of them knew his name,\nposition, age, location or where he precisely where he worked. Nor did they know the means by\nwhich he planned to obtain the secrets that he dangled before them. They also did not know\nwhere, or even if, they would meet their source. Their total knowledge about him was the\ndescription he gave of himself: a “senior government employee in the intelligence community”\n(which, as they only later would find out, was untrue.) For his part, Greenwald speculated that he\nwas a disgruntled CIA station chief. Yet by his anonymous emails, and by tugging at their strings,\nhe had lined up three journalists to break his story.\n\nDespite the fact they were operating largely in the dark, these three journalists acted like almost\nany other ambitious reporter would act if they were offered a major scoop about illegal acts of the\ngovernment. In addition, the information was in line with what they had previously investigated or\nwritten about. None of these journalists had any reason to doubt at this point that their\nanonymous source was anything but the sincere whistle-blower that he claimed to be. They could\nnot have known from his anonymous emails that, aside from the whistle-blowing documents he\npromised them, he was in the process of stealing a large number of documents from the NSA’s\nNational Threat Operations Center that concerned the NSA’s sources and methods in foreign\ncountries. These documents, to which Snowden never referred in his correspondence with them,\nhad little, if anything at all, to do with domestic spying on American citizens.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020238",
