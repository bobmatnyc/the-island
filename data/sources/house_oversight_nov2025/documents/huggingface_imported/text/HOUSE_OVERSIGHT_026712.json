  "text": "In the absence of long-term risk and performance\ndata, the role of ESG is unclear for many sovereigns\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) investing\nlooks to incorporate ethics and sustainability into\n\nthe investment process. Sovereigns are well placed\n\nto implement ESG strategies (or component sub-\nstrategies) due to their scale, reach, size and long-\nterm orientation. In addition, many investment and\nliability sovereigns have a clear basis to consider\nsustainability factors in delivering their objectives,\ngiven their own mandates and through their growing\ninternal management capability.\n\nHowever, contrary to early expectations, uptake\nof ESG practices appears to be less broad than\ninitially anticipated. On the one hand, established\nsovereigns across Europe, Canada and Australia have\nbeen pivotal to the evolution of ESG investing among\ninstitutional investors. Many of these sovereigns were\ncrucial in the development of sovereign investment\nstrategies over past decades, and continue to have\nhigh levels of influence over sovereign models globally\nrelative to their size. Against this, funds in the US\nand emerging markets have been reluctant to commit\nto ESG (figure 22) in the absence of objective data\non the investment risk/return trade-offs implicit in\nthese strategies.\n\nWhile uptake of ESG has not increased in line\nwith historical expectations, there is a clear appetite\nfor perspectives and analysis from adopters, asset\nmanagers and academics. In fact, among institutional\ninvestors globally ESG is cited as the most important\narea for thought leadership (NMG's Global Asset\nManagement Study 2017), highlighting investor\ndemand for greater understanding.\n\n32\n\nQualified support for ‘environmental’ and ‘social’\nscreens given reputational risks of non-adoption,\nhowever further commitment depends on emerging\nevidence of investment implications\nFor sovereigns looking to adopt ESG investing, the\nmost common step is to introduce negative screens\non managers and securities which fall below ethical\nstandards (figure 23). This process lends itself to\nenvironmental and social factors, given growing\nlevels of disclosure of carbon footprint and employee\ndiversity within public markets. Indeed, environmental\nfactors are among the ESG issues of greatest\nimportance to sovereigns shown in figure 24.\n\nCertain sovereigns noted that negative\nenvironmental and social screens can be simply\ninserted into the investment process as an extra step\nwithin security selection, with minimal additional\ncosts of management and expertise. Respondents\nalso stated that the measurement of the investment\nimpact of negative screens was simple, as the social\ninvestment strategy was most often constructed\nfrom a fully inclusive benchmark.\n\nDespite some non-users citing analysis showing\nthe negative effect of ESG screening strategies\non short-term returns, there was a sense among\ninterviewees that greater levels of disclosure\nincreased reputational risk of non-adoption relative\nto high-profile ESG adopters.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026712",
