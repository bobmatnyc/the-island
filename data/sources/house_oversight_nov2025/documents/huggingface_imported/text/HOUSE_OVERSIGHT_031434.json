Or was this discussed\nsubsequently?\n\nSincerely,\nPeter Aldhous\n\nOn 12/11/17 1:00 PM, Peter Aldhous wrote:\n\nDear Dr. Krauss,\n\nThank you for your responses, which state that the allegations made against you are false and/or distorted.\nThat does raise a question:\n\nWhy do you think that multiple women, over more than a decade, have separately made accusations against\nyou?\n\nSincerely,\nPeter Aldhous\n\nOn 12/11/17 9:18 AM, Lawrence Krauss wrote:\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and\nthen heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will\nreport my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be\ncomplete, as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading\nmy responses, I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to\ndistort them.\n\nIt is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading\nstatements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students,\ncolleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which Iam a part. I\ndo not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other\ninstitutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the\nopposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031434",
