Although he provided few final answers, he pricked the\nconscience of a nation, and he goaded the US Supreme Court into action in several\ncases...\n\nI pointed out that no student can go through a three-year course at any major law school without\nstudying the life work of David Bazelon—and I predict that this will be true well into the next\ncentury. The reason for Bazelon’s continuing impact is that his primary role—as he saw it—was\nto raise enduring questions, not to provide transient, trendy solutions. He saw the role of the\ncourts—especially the intermediate appellate courts, such as the one he served on—as uniquely\ncapable of raising questions and directing them at the Supreme Court, the lower District courts,\nthe legislatures and the executives. Bazelon was at his finest when he threw the ball back at\ngovernment officials, making them think hard, reconsider and question their own programs and\npolitical solutions.\n\nOver my own career, I have certainly not been known for effusively praising the judiciary.\nIndeed, part of the reason I have been so critical of so many judges is that I learned at the feet of\none who set a tone and provided a model that few can meet. Perhaps in that respect Bazelon has\nmade me too tough a critic of others. I know he would be proud of having provoked hard\nquestions, even about the judiciary that he loves.\n\nSeveral years after retiring, David Bazelon called to inform me that he had early stage\nAlzheimer’s, a disease that also afflicted my father. I visited with David all through his illness,\noften with his closest friend Bill Brennan. We would take David on walks, reminisce with him\nand tell him stories. I remained his law clerk until he died at age 93.\n\nMy clerkship with Justice Arthur Goldberg was, in many ways, more exciting than my clerkship\nwith Judge Bazelon. It was, after all, on the Supreme Court, where nearly every case made\nheadlines. During my Goldberg clerkship, President Kennedy was assassinated, Lee Harvey\nOswald was killed, and Lyndon Johnson ascended to the oval office. Many transforming\ndecisions were rendered in areas as wide-ranging and important as desegregation, freedom of the\npress, the rights of criminal defendants, the law of obscenity, the death penalty and trial by jury.\nYet, in a more personal way, my second clerkship was somewhat anticlimactic. I learned far more\nduring my year on the court of appeals than during my year on the High Court, in part because\nJudge Bazelon was such a remarkable teacher and in part because it was my first exposure to the\njudiciary in action. This is not to diminish the impact Justice Goldberg had on my life. It too was\nprofound and enduring. The major difference was that Justice Goldberg, who saw me as a\nprotégé, had a specific life plan for me: he wanted me to follow in his footsteps. He saw my\nprofessional life unfolding in parallel to his. He wanted me to work in the Kennedy\n\n60\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017147",
