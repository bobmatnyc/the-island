The secular camp can not even dream of\nmatching the financial resources of the Muslim Brotherhood and the\nremnants of the NDP. Finally, much will depend on the ability of the\nrivals to win public support by means of clear and succinct electoral\nplatforms that truly address people's hopes and aspirations.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing criteria and circumstances as they\ncurrently stand, the \"critical mass\" is likely to swing towards the\nreligious camp, with its better organisational, mobilisational and\nfinancial capacities. In addition, even if that camp truly relinquished\nthe slogan, \"Islam is the solution,\" it still possesses a remarkable\ntalent for swaying public opinion through emotive and misleading\noversimplifications and attacks on the opposing viewpoint. For\nexample, during the referendum on the constitutional amendments, it\ncentred its propaganda around Article 2, claiming that a \"No\" vote\nwould negate the Islamic character of the state. Although the\nproposed constitutional amendments in the referendum came\nnowhere near this article, the tactic worked marvellously, and helped\nyield this camp's desired result.\n\nThe secularists, therefore, have their work cut out for them. They will\nneed to expand their base of support considerably and to try to use\nthe proportional list system to their best advantage. They will also\nhave to enlist the moral and financial support of the business\ncommunity. Finally, they must couch their liberal secularist message\nin a simpler and graspable language that will capture the public's\nattention. Their ability to rise to this challenge will determine the\nfuture of Egypt, the Egyptian constitution and the nature of its\ngovernment. The more effective they are the lower is the probability\nthat the country's first free and fair parliamentary elections will be its\nlast.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030278",
