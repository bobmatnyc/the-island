  "text": "one, for many reasons. Clarisse mentioned that some people \"don't use safewords.\" From\nthe context, she's talking not about people for whom no means no in scene, but people for\nwhom there is no definitive way for the bottom to stop the scene. And perhaps readers\ncan tell from Clarisse's tone that that's... the advanced class. You'll find the safety police\nin any BDSM space or community that finger-wag about it, and the swaggering more-\nkinky-than-thous that brag about it. But what does it mean?\n\nI can only tell you what it means for me. There are times I give up my safeword: only to\nmy spouse. We've been playing together for about a decade and a half. If I give up my\nsafeword, and that's something we do rarely, it doesn't mean I don't have limits. I have\nlimits! Yes I do! There are things I can't handle, mentally or physically, and things I\nnever want to handle! There are \"hard limits,\" things I've said I'm just not willing to do.\nAnd there are soft limits, things I don't think I'm ready for but I'm willing to bump up\nagainst them and see what happens. If I give up my safeword, it means I have limits, but\ninstead of telling her when I've reached them, I'm going to trust her to listen to me and\nwatch me and make that decision. I may say, \"I can't, I can't, I can't,\" and she may decide\nI really can't. Or she may decide I've got more in me than I believe I do. There's a lot of\nrisk associated with that. But there's a trust in those moments and a closeness that does\nnot go away when the scene is over. Or ever, really. Risk and reward: we set our own\ntolerances.\n\nSome folks may have come across the term \"consensual nonconsent.\" It's one of those\nterms with multiple meanings. Some people use it to describe any situation where the\nbottom is saying \"no, don't\" but has not yet safeworded -- a usage I find less than useful.\nOthers use it to describe roleplays of nonconsensual situations. The last common usage,\nthough, is that which I like to describe using Hunter S. Thompson's phrase, \"buy the\nticket, take the ride.” It means that the bottom consents to be in a situation I've just\ndescribed, where the top decides if the bottom needs to stop, often but not always around\nspecific activities, and usually (wisely) heavily negotiated.\n\nClarisse Thorn:\nWhen I give advice about setting safewords, I usually offer the following:\n\nA) Some people like to say that it's good to use a safeword that's jolting, and is likely to\nmake your partner feel totally unsexy. Isn't there a Family Guy episode in which Lois &\nPeter's safeword is \"banana\" or something?\n\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\n\nNot a fan. The more obscure a safeword, the harder it is for a bottom who is spacey or\nflying on endorphins to access it. It's easy to remember \"banana\" in the calm before the\nstorm. At the moment when it's most needed, that can easily become a muddle of\n\"yellow? was it a fruit? Shit, what do I do?\" That's not a place bottoms want to find\nthemselves and a top never, never, never wants to have a bottom who is at a limit but\ncan't communicate about it.\n\nClarisse Thorn:\n\nB) In my experience, the generally accepted safewords in the S&M community are\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018467",
