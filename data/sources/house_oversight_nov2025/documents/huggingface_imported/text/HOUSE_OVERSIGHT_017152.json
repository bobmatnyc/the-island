  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nHoliday services with my family in Brooklyn. The Lyon’s Den, a popular New York gossip\ncolumn, carried the following vignette: [C] He was close to each clerk in a different way,\nfollowing our careers, advising us on life choices and encouraging us to “do great things.”\n\nThree months after I started working for Justice Goldberg I was in his secretary’s office while she\nwas talking on the phone to her husband who was an officer in the U.S. armed forces. I think he\nhad something to do with communications, because he told her that shots had been fired in Dallas.\nWe turned on a small television set that had been in my cubicle ever since the World Series a\ncouple of months earlier. Nothing was yet on the news. A few minutes later everyone in the\nworld knew that President Kennedy had been shot. It was a Friday morning and the nine Justices\nof the Supreme Court were in their weekly private conference, which no one, except for the\nJustices, was allowed to attend. There were no secretary, clerks or messengers. I had been given\nstrict instructions never to interrupt Justice Goldberg during one of these conferences, but I knew\nthis was an exception. And so I went to the door of the private conference room and knocked.\nJustice Goldberg, being the junior Justice, answered the door and gave me a dirty look, saying, “I\ntold you not to interrupt me.” I said, “Mr. Justice, you are going to want to know that the\nPresident has been shot.” Several of the Justices immediately gathered around my little television\nset which, it turned out, was the only one in the entire Supreme Court building. We watched, as\nthe news got progressively worse, finally leading to the announcement that the President was\ndead. The Chief Justice asked all of the Justices to disperse for fear that there might be a\nconspiracy involving attacks on other institutions. The clerks stayed behind to finish the court’s\nbusiness.\n\nThe following night, right after the Sabbath was over, Justice Goldberg asked me to pick him up\nand drive him to the White House. He was closely connected both to the Kennedy family and to\nLyndon Johnson, and the new President wanted his advice. I picked up the Justice in my old\nPeugeot, which was filled with children’s toys. I drove him to the White House gate. Goldberg\nasked me to wait for him, since the meeting would be relatively brief, and drive him home. When\nthe White House guard looked into the car, he immediately flung the back door open and grabbed\na toy plastic gun. Nerves were pretty tense. He wouldn’t let me wait inside the White House\ngate, so I had to wait outside until the Justice returned. I also drove him to the funeral and was\nwith him when the news came over the radio that Lee Harvey Oswald had been shot. Goldberg\nexclaimed angrily, “What kind of a country are we living in!”\n\nShortly thereafter, Chief Justice Earl Warren told the Supreme Court staff and employees that he\nwas becoming Chairman of the newly formed Warren Commission. I asked Goldberg why he\nwould do that. Goldberg told me something, which only in retrospect became clear. He said that\nthe President had asked him to perform a patriotic duty and to convince the American public that\nthe act was that of a lone gunman, and not a conspiracy by the communists. Warren agreed\nbecause he did not want to allow any excuses either for a return of McCarthyism or for military\nhostilities between the Soviet Union and the United States. I later learned that Lyndon Johnson\npersonally believed that there was a conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination, but handpicked\nthe Warren Commission to assure that even if the evidence pointed in that direction, it would be\ncovered up in the interest of national security.\n\n65\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017152",
