The place is a tribute to Kennedy-era “American kitsch,”\nand its 35-year-old proprietor Joulan El Aschkar displays a\nsophisticated touch, from Pierre Cardin—period wallpaper to Mad\nMen—worthy vintage furniture and electronics to 100 gigabytes of\nforgotten '60s hits like B. J. Thomas’s “Raindrops Keep Falling on\nMy Head,” rotating with fully intended irony.\n\nI’m merely there for free Wi-Fi, but when El Aschkar notices an\nactual American in his shrine to America, he eagerly engages me in\nconversation, then directs my laptop to his family’s website—solely\ndevoted to the idea that the World Trade Center attack was an inside\njob perpetrated by U.S. neocons. “I just ask questions,” he shrugs\nmischievously. “The American version isn’t credible.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025022",
