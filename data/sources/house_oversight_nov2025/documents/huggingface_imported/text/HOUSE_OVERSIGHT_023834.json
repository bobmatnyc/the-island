  "text": "8g Teaching Minds\n\nHow can we offer new curricula and new ways of learning if no mat-\nter what we do children must pass algebra tests? Each administration\nsays over and over again that science is important, but since science\nin high school is defined for the most part by boring tests of vocabu-\nlary terms and definitions, who would be excited to learn science? If\na really good scientific reasoning curriculum were created, the schools\ncould not offer it unless it helped kids pass the very same tests that\nthat curriculum was intended to replace.\n\nWe must make radical change. The only way to do that is to stop\nfocusing on teaching subjects and stop using the fact-based tests are\nthe natural end result of that focus on subjects.\n\nAn education system based on cognitive processes would look\nvery different indeed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023834",
