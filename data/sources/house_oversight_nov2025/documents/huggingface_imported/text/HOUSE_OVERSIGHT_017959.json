Dershowitz, personally, intentionally, and maliciously made false and damaging\nstatements of fact concerning Roberts, as detailed above, in the Southern District of New York\nand elsewhere.\n\n90. The false statements that Dershowitz made, personally on behalf of himself and\nEpstein not only called Roberts’s truthfulness and integrity into question, but also exposed\nRoberts to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and disgrace.\n\n91. At the time Dershowitz made his false statements, he and Epstein, knew full well\nthat they were completely false.\n\n92.  Dershowitz’s false statements constitute libel, as he and Epstein knew that they\nwere going to be transmitted in writing, widely disseminated on the internet and in print.\nDershowitz intended his false statements to be published by newspaper and other media outlets\ninternationally, and they were, in fact, published globally, including within the Southern District\nof New York.\n\n93.  Dershowitz’s false statements constitute libel per se, including that they accused\nher of a crime, and including that they exposed Roberts to public contempt, ridicule, aversion,\nand disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in the minds of right-thinking persons.\n\n94. Dershowitz’s false statements also constitute libel per se, inasmuch, among other\nreasons, as they tended to injure Roberts in her professional capacity as the president of a non-\nprofit corporation designed to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her\ncredibility and reputation among members of the community that seeks her help and that she\n\nseeks to serve.\n\n25\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017959",
