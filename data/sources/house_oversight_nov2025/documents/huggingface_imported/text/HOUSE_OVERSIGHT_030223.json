In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the\noutcome of a trial.\n\n*111) Any payment or offer of payment made to a person later cited to\ngive evidence in proceedings must be disclosed to the prosecution and\ndefence. The witness must be advised of this requirement.\n\n16\n*Payment to criminals\n\ni) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information,\nwhich seek to exploit a particular crime or to glorify or glamorise\ncrime in general, must not be made directly or via agents to convicted\nor confessed criminals or to their associates — who may include\nfamily, friends and colleagues.\n\nii) Editors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers\nwould need to demonstrate that there was good reason to believe the\npublic interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public\ninterest emerged, then the material should not be published.\n\nRoss Gow\nManaging Partner\n\nACUITY a Limited\n\nMobile\n\nTel\n\nacuityreputation.con <a\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn 10 Mar 2011, at 16:41, GMAX | sd wrote:\n\nActually school means university in the states.
