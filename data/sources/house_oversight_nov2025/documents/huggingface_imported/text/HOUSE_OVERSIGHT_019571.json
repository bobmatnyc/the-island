(Accord-\ning to Greenwald, Gellman could not make the trip, because lawyers\nfor The Washington Post were uneasy with having a reporter receive\nclassified documents in a part of China.)\n\nOn May 24, 2013, Snowden attempted to apply more pressure on\nGellman by telling him that the story about the PRISM program\nhad to be published by the Post within seventy-two hours. Gellman\ncould not accede to such a condition, because the decision of when to\npublish a story was made not by him but by the editors of the news-\npaper. He told Snowden that the earliest the story could be published\nwas June 6, 2013, which was well past Snowden’s deadline.\n\nSnowden next turned to Greenwald in Brazil. Both Poitras and\nMicah Lee had made great efforts to tutor Greenwald on encryption\nprotocols, with Lee’s sending Greenwald a DVD by FedEx that would\nallow him to receive both encrypted messages and encrypted phone\ncalls. Even then, Greenwald was unable to fully install it. As a result,\nGreenwald still had not met Snowden’s requisites on encrypting his\n\n© computer. ®\n\nWith Gellman uncertain, Greenwald was now essential to Snow-\nden’s plan. If he was to have any newspaper outlet, he needed to\npersuade Greenwald to come to Hong Kong. At this point, he took\nmatters into his own hands. On May 25, Snowden somewhat aggres-\nsively e-mailed Greenwald, saying, “I’ve been working on a major\nproject with a mutual friend of ours. You recently had to decline\nshort-term travel to meet with me.” Although he did not specify the\n“short-term travel” to which he referred, he added pointedly, “You\nneed to be involved in this story.” He suggested that they imme-\ndiately speak on the phone via a website that encrypts conversa-\ntions. Snowden began the call by complaining, “I don’t like how this\nis developing.” He made it clear that he, not the journalist he had\nselected, was pulling the strings. If Greenwald wanted the scoop, he\nhad to follow Snowden’s instructions, which included dividing the\nscoops between The Guardian and The Washington Post. According\nto his plan, Gellman would break the PRISM story in the Post, and\nGreenwald would break the “mass domestic spying” story in The\nGuardian. In addition, he insisted that The Guardian publish his per-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 83 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019571",
