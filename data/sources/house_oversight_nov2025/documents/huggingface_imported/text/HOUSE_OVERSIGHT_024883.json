While we currently lack insight into when CBD products may become\navailable in Whole Foods stores, or what a regional or national rollout might look like,\nbelow we analyze Amazon’s physical footprint to highlight the potential for distribution.\n\nAmazon’s expanding physical footprint is made up of a small number of Go Stores,\nAmazon Fresh Grocery Pickup in Seattle, Amazon Branded Book Stores and most\nnotably its Whole Foods Market business. Whole Foods is a health focused supermarket\nchain based out of Austin TX that operates ~470 US locations and was purchased by\nAmazon in Aug ’17. Since acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon has deeply integrated it with\nthe company’s Prime offering. In combination with Amazon’s Prime Now platform,\nWhole Foods is now offering 2-hour delivery on thousands of in-store items in 63 cities,\nwhich account for over 50% of the US population and over 2/3rds of US GDP. Whole\nFoods also offers curbside pickup in over 20 markets.\n\nFigure 112 Amazon Prime Now & Same Day Delivery Top 50 US Metro Areas By 2017 GDP (%}\n\n2017 GDP s % of ‘17 % of '17 US Amazon Prime Now AmazonPrimeFreeSame- WFM Delivery via\nU.S. Metropolitan Areas . : . .\nRank Us GDP Population Available Day Delivery Prime Now\n1 New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA. 9.8% 6.2% v v v\n2 Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA 5.9% 41% v v v\n3 Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI 3.9% 2.9% v v v\n4 Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX 3.1% 2.0% v v v\n5 Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV 3.0% 1.9% v v v\n6 San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA. 2.9% 2.2% v ce v\n7 Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX 2.8% 14% v v v\n8 Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD. 2.5% 1.9% v v v\n9 Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH 2.5% 1.5% v v v\n10 Atlanta-Sandy Springs- Roswell, GA 2.2% 1.7% v v v\n11 Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA 2.0% 18% v v v\n12 Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL 2.0% 1.1% ¥ vo ¥\n13 San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA. 16% 1.1% v v\n14 Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI 15% 13% v\n15 Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI 15% 0.6% v v v\n16 Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ 14% 1.0% v v v\n17 San Diego-Carlshad, CA 13% 14% v v v\n18 Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO 12% 09% ve e %\n19 Baltimore-Columbia- Towson, MD 11% 0.9% v v v\n20 Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC 10% 0.7% v v v\n24 Portland-Vancouver- Hillsboro, OR-WA 10% 0.9% v v v\n22 St. Louis, MO-IL 0.9% 0.7% aa\n23 Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA 0.9% 14% a\n24 Austin-Round Rock, TX 08% 0.7% oS v\n25 Pittsburgh, PA 0.8% 0.6% v\n26 Tampa-St. Petersburg- Clearwater, FL 0.8% 0.9% v v v\n27 |ndianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, IN 0.8% 0.6% v v v\n28 Cleveland- Elyria, OH 0.8% 0.7% v v\n29 Cincinnati, OH-KY-IN 08% 0.6% ¥ v P\n30 Columbus, OH 08% 0.6% v v v\n34 Nashville-Davidson--Murfreesboro--Franklin, TN 0.8% 0.7% v v v\n32 Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL 0.8% 0.6% v v v\n33 Kansas City, MO-KS 0.7% 0.7% v v\n34 San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX 07% 0.6% ¥ F ¥\n35 Sacramento--Roseville--Arden-Arcade, CA 07% 0.7% ve % ae\n36 Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV 0.6% 0.6% v v v\n37 Milwaukee-Waukesha- West Allis, WI 0.6% 0.5% v v v\n38 Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT 0.6% 0.3%\n39 Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC 0.5% 0.5% v v\n40 Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, CT 05% 04% te\n41 Salt Lake City, UT 0.5% 04% v v\n42 Raleigh, NC 0.5% 0.5% v v v\n43 Providence- Warwick, RI-MA 05% 04% v\n44 Richmond, VA 05% 04% ve a oe\n45 New Orleans-Metairie, LA 05% 04% Me\n46 Jacksonville, FL 0.4% 04% a a\nA?
