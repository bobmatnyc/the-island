  "text": "I was grateful not only to Shamir for naming me chief-of-staff, but to Rabin\nand Misha. Both had honored the assurance Yitzhak had given me that I’d be\nDan’s successor. I also discovered Misha had played an even greater role than\nI’d assumed. I knew there would be other candidates for the job. The strongest\nturned out to be Yossi Peled, who was the head of the northern command and\npossessed the undoubted credentials to be an excellent chief-of-staff. What I\nhadn’t been aware of was the sentiment among some in the Likud that I was the\nwrong choice politically. Not only had been born on a Labor kibbutz. There was\nthe small matter of the article in Hadashot several years earlier, imagining me\nas a Labor leader going head-to-head in a future election against Bibi\nNetanyahu for the Likud.\n\nYossi was assumed to be more of a Likudnik, and a few weeks before Dan\nleft office, I learned how Misha had rebutted the suggestion I was politically\nunfit to lead the armed forces. He was visiting the north and was taken aside by\na group of Likud activists who asked how he could possibly be thinking of\nsupporting Barak — a Labor guy — for chief-of-staff. At first, Misha didn’t reply.\nBut one woman kept pressing him.\n\n“Do you have children in the army?” he asked.\n“Yes. I have a son in the Golani Brigade,” she replied proudly.\n\n“So let’s assume your son is going on a raid across the border. Would you\nwant his company to be led by the best commander in the battalion? Or by a\ncommander who’s Likud?”\n\n“The best commander, of course,” she said.\n\nTo which Misha said: “Well we do, too.”\n\n240\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011711",
