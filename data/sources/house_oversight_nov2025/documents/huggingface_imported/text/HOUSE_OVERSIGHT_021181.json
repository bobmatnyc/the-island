  "text": "When I was noticed watching them, about fifteen of them came up to me\nand began to beg for money and food. | was over taken by the poor,\nhungry children and I felt sad for them all and wished I could help out\nsomehow. When the tide of kids washed away and the street went empty,\nI was overcome with intrigue at these two little boys. Brothers I found out\nlater on, and there only toy was an empty can they were kicking to each\nother in the middle of the street. Intelligent kids, they were able to speak\nthree different languages, including English and I was interested to ask\nthem about life here. They didn’t seem to notice or be bothered by their\npoverty stricken lives. They told me about their school and parents and I\nthought | had just heard the saddest story ever but they were accustomed\nto living like that like I had been so accustomed to my degrading lifestyle\nfor so long.\n\n1] was compelled to empty out the contents of my purse, giving them\nover two thousand dollars in U.S currency. A passer-byer snapped a\nphoto of the kids and me for myself to take home as a personal souvenir\nbefore they rushed home to proudly show there parents the money. I told\nJeffrey later on of my good deed and he couldn’t believe I’d give away\nmy money so carelessly. He told me | had set up their parents with\nenough money to feed and shelter their family for a year. Wasn’t that a\ngood thing? I couldn’t believe it, not that | was well off or anything close\ntoo it, but to realize how lucky I was and to not have compassion for the\nlesser off, especially children of a third- world country, I wouldn’t be\nhuman anymore. Then again what did I expect from someone who could\nnumerously steal another man’s daughter for the use of his own sexual\npleasure with great ease.\n\nWe went out to lunch the following day with Jeffrey’s team of\ndesigners to wrap things up and after Jeffrey’s afternoon massage he went\nto the palace to have a nap. When | was all alone I thought I’d go see the\nculture of the local unique markets again and this time buy some trinkets\nto bring home. I got to sightseeing and took pictures of the legs of lamb\nhung over the blood drenched doorway over people’s homes as to warn\noff evil spirits and the ghettos where the local villager’s called home. I\nwalked into many of the market’s stalls and saw the most peculiar\nantiques, such as weaponry with the blood of it’s last victim stained on\nit’s sharp blades and body pieces of various animal’s for the use of\nreligious sacrifices. I was more interested in the different culture and\nrespecting their ancient way of life with interest, instead of squirming like\na tourist and getting grossed out. I thought it was so educational and\nenthralling in fact, [ ended up buying a few sacrificial trinkets to have\nsent to my apartment in Palm Beach. Not to say that I wasn’t looking\nforward to getting back to the luxuries of western civilization it was a bit\nlike camping, fun and adventurous but as equally dangerous and thrilling.\n\n73\n\n©] Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004206\n\nWhen we left for the final destination of our trip | was looking forward to\neating normal food again, not one to stray for foreign dishes, I’m a more\nof a cheeseburger and pizza kind of girl, a true sign of my American\nheritage.\n\nWe landed at the Heathrow Int’l Airport and greeted by a driver that\nwould take us to Ghislane’s town house in London’s central that Jeffrey\nhad recently bought and refurbished as a gift for her. Emmy said “Good-\nBye” at the airport, leaving us to go to her hometown in the rural\ncountryside nearby to visit family for a six-week holiday from work. It\nwasn’t a very long drive before we were in the heart of the city and at\nGhislane’s place. I thought it was a cheery townhouse that had character\nand the historical pub in front of it and cobblestone streets only added a\nunique charm to its presence. They were going out for dinner and invited\nme along with them but seeing | was so exhausted from all the travelling\nand looking a bit melancholy, I apologetically declined going out for\ndinner that evening, I rather would be taking a few pills to catch up on\nsome needed sleep. “Are you sure your Okay”? Ghislane asked as she\nshowed me to my room, more considerate than she normally was but |\nassured her that | was in absolute good health, just tired from all of the\nrecent jet lag. Without another word said she whisked off downstairs, to\nthe car where Jeffrey was waiting for her.\n\nI took the liberty to call my parents house to say “Hello” and catch up\nwith them since I hadn’t been home at all for the holiday season this year,\nalways too busy working. They sounded really happy to hear from me\nand my mom put me on the phone to talk to my brothers as well. | got to\ntell them about my travels abroad and I had some cool tribal stuff from\nAfrica that I bought for them. They sounded so proud of me, all of them,\nand why shouldn’t they be? In everyone’s convinced mind I was making\ngreat money, travelling the world, and meeting new faces everywhere |\nwent, why should I spoil anyone’s delusions, especially mine. | took my\nsleeping tablets and had a bath before falling into a deep and much\nneeded sleep.\n\nThe next morning I was woken up by Ghislane who | could tell was in a\nchirpy mood by the way she paraded through my closed door saying\n“Wake-up sleepy head” and opened the window’s shutters to let in the\nbright sunlight, she had never done anything like this before and I knew\nimmediately something big was happening. She sat down on my bed as I\nrolled over from my deep slumber and | was able to mutter for an\nexplanation as to why she was awake so early. “Besides the fact it is ten\no’clock in the morning and nearly time for brunch, we have a big day\nplanned out for you today.” She was waiting for my cue to ask her “What\nare we doing”, when I did, she responded with a convincing enthusiasm\n“We're going shopping for a new ensemble” she paused for a moment to\n\n74\n\nO Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFRE004207\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021181",
