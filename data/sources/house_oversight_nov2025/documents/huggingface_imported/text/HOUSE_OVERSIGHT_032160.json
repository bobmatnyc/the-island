  "text": "the country’s productive and export sectors all but collapsed, there just wasn’t enough of the\nforeign currencies in circulation.\n\n“If you wanted to buy a packet of sweets for your child, you couldn’t get change,” said\nMasiyiwa. Econet intervened with a mobile payments system which has set Zimbabwe on\ncourse to become Africa’s first cashless economy. “Today 43 percent of the GDP moves\nthrough Econet Wireless,” said the telecoms mogul. Explained Econet’s chief executive,\nDouglas Mboweni , recently said: “We do not expect anyone to still be using paper money in\na year’s time. It will be just like Europe or America, where you no longer see people carrying\nbundles of cash.”\n\nMasiyiwa told the Guardian that his next challenge is to create a product that allows people\nwho are informally employed, such as smallholder farmers and casual workers, to access\ncredit. “In Africa 70 percent of people are informally employed,” he says. “The big frontier for\nus is to create platforms where those people can access credit.” There is little risk that they\nwill get into unmanageable debt because the banks won’t extend excessive credit, calling\nthe system “self-regulating”.\n\n“We're trying to build up a savings culture where people are encouraged to save, even if\nthey only have a dollar — for children’s school fees, for transport, for the doctor. A savings\nand credit infrastructure builds resilience.” However, in order to reach the unbanked,\nfinancial institutions — and telecommunications companies — must design services that are\npractical, simple and affordable. “I’ve got a customer who has a dollar in his pocket and has\ngot to decide to have some lunch, call his cousin or go to the doctor,” he said.\n\n“We have to develop services with sensitivity to the fact that in Africa our customers don’t\nhave the same disposable income as in New Zealand, for example.” It would however, be a\nmistake to assume the poorest behave differently to other customers. “Their behaviour and\naspirations are no different from those who have higher incomes,” cautioned Masiyiwa.\n“They want to use Facebook. They want to use WhatsApp. We have to find ways for them to\naccess those things with their very low income.”\n\nThe UK Guardian 19-08-2014\n\n- Will Zimbabwe be Africa’s first cashless society? Telecommunications company, and now\nmobile banking service, Econet Wireless predicts that in less than 12 months notes and\ncoins will be long-gone from this southern African country. “We do not expect anyone to still\nbe using paper money in a year’s time,” the company’s CEO Douglas Mboweni recently\nsaid. “It will be just like Europe or America, where you no longer see people carrying bundles\nof cash.” The collapse of Zimbabwe’s economy in 2002 paved the way for Econet Wireless’s\nmobile payment system. “Hyperinflation had destroyed people’s confidence in financial\ninstitutions,” said the Zimbabwe company’s founder, Strive Masiyiwa, at the Mastercard\nFoundation Symposium on Financial Inclusion in July.\n\n“The lowest denomination circulating was $1,” Masiyiwa said. “If you want to buy a packet of\nsweets for your child, you can’t get change.” The company set up a mobile payment system\nthat handles small amounts and allows people to save as little as $1. “Today 43% of the\nGDP moves through Econet Wireless,” he concludes. Masiyiwa was born in Zimbabawe\n(then Rhodesia) in 1961. He and his parents fled the country in the turmoil after prime\nminister lan Smith declared independence in 1965, settling in Zambia. His parents, who ran\ntheir own business, could afford to send Masiyiwa to school in Scotland when he was 12.\nAfter school he studied electronic engineering at the University of Wales and worked briefly\nfor a computer company in Cambridge before returning to Zimbabwe in the early 1980s.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032160",
