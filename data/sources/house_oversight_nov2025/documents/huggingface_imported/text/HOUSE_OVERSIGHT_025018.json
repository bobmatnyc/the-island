  "text": "22\n\nThe masters and preachers of terror had told their foot soldiers, and\nthe great mass on the fence, that the Americans would make a run for\nit—as they had in Lebanon and Somalia, that they didn't have the\nstomach for a fight. The Arabs barely took notice when America\nstruck the Taliban in Kabul. What was Afghanistan to them? It was a\nblighted and miserable land at a safe distance.\n\nBut the American war, and the sense of righteous violation, soon hit\nthe Arab world itself. Saddam Hussein may not have been the Arab\nidol he was a decade earlier, but he was still a favored son of that\nArab nation, its self-appointed defender. The toppling of his regime,\nsome 18 months or so after 9/11, had brought the war closer to the\nArabs. The spectacle of the Iraqi despot flushed out of his spider hole\nby American soldiers was a lesson to the Arabs as to the falseness and\nfutility of radicalism.\n\nIt is said that \"the east\" is a land given to long memory, that there the\npast is never forgotten. But a decade on, the Arab world has little to\nsay about 9/1 1—at least not directly. In the course of that Arab\nSpring, young people in Tunisia and Egypt brought down the dreaded\ndictators. And in Libya, there is the thrill of liberty, delivered, in part,\nby Western powers. In the slaughter-grounds of Syria, the rage is not\ndirected against foreign demons, but against the cruel rulers who\nhave robbed that population of a chance at a decent life.\n\nAmerica held the line in the aftermath of 9/11. It wasn't brilliant at\neverything it attempted in Arab lands. But a chance was given the\nArabs to come face to face, and truly for the first time, with the\nharvest of their own history. Now their world is what they make of it.\n\nMr. Ajami is a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover\n\nInstitution and co-chair of the Working Group on Islamism and the\nInternational Order.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025018",
