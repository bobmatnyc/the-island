It was,\nas I found, only a nine minute walk through the transit passageway in which one does not have to\nshow a passport. But that raises the question: Was Snowden’s plan really to go to Ecuador?\n\nConsider Snowden’s putative motivation in seeking sanctuary in Ecuador: his safety. Yet,\nSnowden assessed that he would be vulnerable to capture by the U.S. government in Ecuador. “If\nthey [the U.S. Government] really wanted to capture me, they would’ve allowed me to travel to\nLatin America, because the CIA can operate with impunity down there,” he explained in a\nrecorded interview with Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor of Zhe Nation, in 2014, He had\npreviously discussed the likelihood of his being captured in Ecuador with Julian Assange in Hong\nKong in June 2013 before his departure for Moscow. He also told Alan Rusbridger, the editor of\nthe Guardian, that he considered that he was at risk in Latin America. This vulnerability was no\nminor matter to Snowden. He told Glenn Greenwald in Hong Kong, before arranging to fly to\nMoscow, that his “first priority” was his own “physical safety.” Since he did not believe Ecuador\nwas a Safe place for him, why would he leave the comparative safety of Russia and risk being\nkidnapped by American forces in Latin America?\n\nNor was a U.S. passport a prerequisite for U.S. citizens flying to Havana in 2013. Since the\nState Department did not sanction travel to Cuba for the general public, the vast majority of\nAmericans going to Cuba obtained a travel document from a Cuban consulate so the Cuban entry\nstamp would not be marked in their passport.) So Snowden, if he really had intended to fly to\nCuba, only needed this document. He had over a month to obtain it from the Cuban consulate in\nHong Kong. But he did not. He could also have obtained a visa to Ecuador at its consulate in\nHong Kong. But he did not. According to his lawyer Kucherena, who closely examined his\npassport in July 2013, Snowden had no visas at all. Unlike his words, Snowden’s actions were\nwith any plan to go to any place in Latin America.\n\nShortly after the “special operation,” a tip was placed on a publicly-accessible Russian website\nsaying that Snowden was booked on the Aeroflot flight SU-150 to Cuba on June 24th. In\nresponse to this anonymous tip, Russian and foreign news organization in Moscow ordered their\nreporters to buy tickets on that flight With their tickets, reporters swarmed into the departure area\nof the airport in such numbers that the police had to set up cordons. They checked all the VIP\nlounges, restaurants, rest rooms and boarding area for the next seven hours, but Snowden was\nnowhere to be found. A Russia Today reporter later said “It was a total madhouse. Everyone was\nscreaming ‘Snowden’ at the airport ground staff.” Over a hundred reporters actually boarded the\nplane.\n\nIn fact, Snowden had never checked in for that flight and, as far as is known, was never seen in\nterminal E. Only after the plane took off did the journalists realize Snowden was not aboard it.\nAll they could do was photograph two of the unoccupied seats, 17A and 17 C, which they\nreported in tweets were Snowden’s and Harrison empty seats. By the time the plane landed in\nCuba Aeroflot denied that anyone named Snowden had ever been booked on any of its flight to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020347",
