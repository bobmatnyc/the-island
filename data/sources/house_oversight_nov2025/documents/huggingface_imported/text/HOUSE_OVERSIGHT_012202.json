  "text": "JAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ.\nMay 19, 2008\nPAGE 5 OF 6\n\nC. “Mr. Epstein Does Not Believe He Is Guilty Of The Federal Charges Enumerated\nUnder Section 2255.”\n\nAt our December 14, 2007 meeting at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami, counsel for\nEpstein announced, inter alia, that it was a “profound injustice” to require Epstein to register as a\nsex offender and reiterated that no federal crime, especially 18 U.S.C. Section 2422(b), had been\ncommitted since the statute is only violated if a telephone or means of interstate commerce is used\nto do the persuading or inducing. This particular attack on this statute had been previously raised and\nthoroughly considered and rejected by the SDFL and CEOS prior to the execution of the Agreement.\nYou also argued that the facts were inapplicable to the contemplated state statutes and that Epstein\nshould not have been allowed to have been induced into the Agreement because the facts were not\n\n\"what he understood them to be. It should be noted that the SDFL.has never provided you with any\n\nevidence supporting its investigation. This is not, and has never been, an Alford plea situation (see\nNorth Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160 (1970)). Ultimately, you requested an\nindependent review.\n\nSubsequent to the above-mentioned meeting, the SDFL received three letters from you and/or\nMr. Starr which expanded on some of the themes announced in the December 14” meeting.\nEssentially, you portrayed the SDFL as trying to coerce’a plea to unknown allegations and incoherent\ntheories. On December 17, 2007, you decreed that Epstein’s conduct did not meet the requirements\n\nof solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution (FI. Stat. Section 796.03) one of the enumerated\n\ncrimes Epstein had previously agreed to plead guilty to; that Epstein’s conduct does not require\nregistration under Florida law; and the State Attorney’s Office does not believe the conduct is\nregistrable. On December 21, 2007, you rejected the USA’s proposed resolution of the 2255\nprovision because you “strongly believe that the provable conduct of Mr. Epstein with respect to\nthese individuals fails to satisfy the requisite elements of either 18 U.S.C. Section[s] 2422(b) ... or\n.-. 2423(b).” In your December 26, 2007 correspondence you stated that “we have reiterated in\nprevious submissions that Mr. Epstein does not believe he is guilty of the federal charges enumerated\nunder section 2255” and requiring “Mr. Epstein to in essence admit guilt, though he believes he did\nnot commit the requisite offense.”\n\nAs the SDFL has reiterated time and time again, it does not want, nor does it expect, Epstein\n\n\" to plead guilty to a charge he does not believe he committed. As a result, we obliged your request\n\nfor an independent de novo review of the investigation and facilitated such a review at the highest\nlevels of the Department of Justice. It is our understanding that that independent review is now\ncomplete and a determination has been made that there are no impediments to a federal prosecution\nby the SDFL.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012202",
