Other illusions play with\ndepth perception. The Penrose Steps are a type of illusion that tries to\nbuild an impossible physical model in our cerebral cortex. The brain sees\nperspective and depth perception cues, but the resulting shape could\nnever exist.\n\nHearing\nUnlike sight, hearing is an absolute sense. Our ears capture and focus\nsound down to the eardrum where a set of small hairs called cilia convert\nit into electrical impulses.
