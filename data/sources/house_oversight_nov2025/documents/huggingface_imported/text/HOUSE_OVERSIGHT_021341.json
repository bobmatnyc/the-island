  "text": "actually exists, or may not see it at all.\nThis is true of the relative difficulty that\npeople have seeing other minds\ncompared to one’s own, in ways that are\nsometimes very subtle and surprising.\nFor instance, we tend to evaluate\nourselves by consulting our mindful\nintentions, but we evaluate others (and\ntheir intentions) by observing their\nactions. We may consider ourselves to\nbe conscientious if we planned to buy\nour spouse a birthday gift, but need to\nsee an actual gift to infer that our spouse\nis equally conscientious. * We tend to\nbelieve that we are more likely to\nexperience complicated mental emotions\nlike shame, guilt, or embarrassment than\nare others.” We tend to believe that our\nown behavior will therefore be guided\nby moral sentiments like empathy, guilt,\nor compassion whereas others’ behavior\nis more likely driven by the relatively\nmindless motives of self-interest.° Other\nminds are more opaque than our own,\nand some learning, attending, seeking,\nand projecting is required for our brains\nto become fully social and see into them.\nHere’s how’.\n\nLearning. Children do not enter\nthe world able to think about other\nminds, but they learn to do so fairly\nquickly. At around three months of age,\nchildren start preferentially attending to\nanimate objects compared to inanimate\nobjects, and at around six months of age\nstart to distinguish between intentional\n(goal-directed) and unintentional\n(accidental) action. At this age, for\ninstance, children will look reliably\nlonger at a person who is reaching for a\ncup than to a person who is making the\nsame reaching motion in the absence of\nacup. Over the next 18 months,\nchildren become more likely to mimic\nintentional than unintentional actions’, to\nfollow the gaze of another person and\n\nPage |95\n\ntherefore share his or her attentional\nfocus, and recognize that other people\nmay have preferences that differ from\none’s own. By age two, children’s\nsocial ability to read other minds seems\nto have already surpassed that of our\nnearest primate relatives, and over the\nnext two years they pick up what appear\nto be uniquely human mind-reading\ncapacities. By age five, children\ndemonstrate the most sophisticated of\nmind-reading abilities—the capacity to\nrecognize that others’ beliefsS may differ\nfrom one’s own and to use those\ndiffering (sometimes mistaken) beliefs to\npredict the other agent’s behavior.\nVariability from age five onward comes\nfrom learning more specific details about\nhow other minds actually work, largely\ngathered from personal experience,\nreligious practice, or broader cultural\nnorms.\n\nMany psychologists and\nneuroscientists speculate that learning to\nread other minds comes from the deeply\nsocial tendency, present at birth, to\nmimic others’ actions. For example,\nSteve Small examines a neurological\nunderpinning for mimicry, and Jean\nDecety argues in his essay that an inborn\ncapacity for mimicry underlies the\nhuman capacity for empathy. Looking\nwhere others look and copying their\nactions is a reasonable way to copy their\nlikely mental states as well. This\negocentric method of using one’s own\nmental experience as a guide to other\nminds continues to be employed\nthroughout adulthood, and can give\ninsight into others’ mental states but can\nalso lead people to overestimate the\nextent to which others’ minds are similar\nto one’s own. These biases tend to be\ncalled egocentric when reasoning about\nother people, and they tend to be called\nanthropomorphic when reasoning about\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021341",
