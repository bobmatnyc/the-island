So he’s kept trying.”\n\n“He’s Donald,” said Ailes.\n\n“It’s a magnificent thing,” said Bannon, who had taken to regarding Trump as\nsomething like a natural wonder, beyond explanation.\n\nAgain, as though setting the issue of Trump aside—merely a large and peculiar\npresence to both be thankful for and to have to abide—Bannon, in the role he had\nconceived for himself, the auteur of the Trump presidency, charged forward:\n\n“China’s everything. Nothing else matters. We don’t get China right, we don’t get\nanything right. This whole thing is very simple. China is where Nazi Germany was in\n1929 to 1930. The Chinese, like the Germans, are the most rational people in the world,\nuntil they’re not. And they’re gonna flip like Germany in the thirties.

Ailes, since his ouster from Fox,\nhad become only more bitter towards Murdoch. Now Murdoch was frequently jawboning\nthe president-elect and encouraging him toward establishment moderation—all a strange\ninversion in the ever-stranger currents of American conservatism. Bannon wanted Ailes to\nsuggest to Trump, a man whose many neuroses included a horror of forgetfulness or\nsenility, that Murdoch might be losing it.\n\n“Tll call him,” said Ailes. “But Trump would jump through hoops for Rupert.
