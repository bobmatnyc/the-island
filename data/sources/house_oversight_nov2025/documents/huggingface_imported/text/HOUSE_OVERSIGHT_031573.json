  "text": "Saudi and Iran, powerhouses of Sunni and Shiite Islam respectively,\npresently support opposing sides in many of the Middle East’s major\nconfrontations, and are often seen as having radically divergent and\ncompeting visions for the future of the region.\n\nWhich is why, in Lebanon — a country where the two powers wield\nextensive influence over their respective allies — the news of a possible\nrapprochement has already sparked confidence that political deadlock on a\nnumber of key disputes may be resolved, perhaps even defying\nexpectations of a presidential vacuum by ushering in a successor to\nPresident Michel Suleiman in time for the expiry of his term on 25 May.\n\n“T [now] believe we will have an elected president on the 25th,” said MP\nAhmad Fatfat of the Saudi-supported Future Movement. “That [Prince\nFaisal’s] invitation was public means they already agreed on many points\nunder the table. That means the negotiations regarding the new president\nhave already been done.”\n\nBeyond the elections, Fatfat added the talks would likely also yield wider\nbenefits in terms of security and the economy. Earlier this week, Saudi\nlifted what has been described as an “unofficial ban” on its citizens\ntraveling to Lebanon, fueling hopes of a boost to the country’s struggling\ntourism industry. Saudi analysts concurred that the overall situation in\nLebanon would likely improve in the near future.\n\n“T think in Lebanon there is already agreement [between Saudi and Iran],”\nsaid Jamal Khashoggi, veteran Saudi journalist and former advisor to then-\nambassador Prince Turki al-Faisal. “The agreement in Lebanon is to\ncontain the situation.”\n\nIn neighboring Syria, however, where Iranian-backed regime forces\ncontinue to suppress a Saudi-supported armed rebellion, Khashoggi\nexpects very little to materialize from Saudi-Iranian talks.\n\n“I’m not optimistic,” he told NOW. “The Saudis and Iranians are still far\napart. The Iranians must relinquish their expansionism toward the\nMediterranean, or we have to give up Syria. And I don’t think we can\nafford to give up Syria. And besides, even if we decide to give up Syria,\nthe Syrian people are not going to give up Syria.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031573",
