  "text": "championship of the Palestinian cause, themselves became the\nenemies of the people, being crowned during the current\nrevolutionary period with infamy and dishonour. This applies to the\nformer regime in Iraq, the regime in Syria and the Mubarak regime in\nEgypt.\n\nThe case of Hizbullah reflects this revolutionary predicament with\nrespect to the Palestinian cause and the struggle against Israel. It\nsuffices to recall which side this group came down upon when it had\nto chose between the Syrian people, who are presently fighting for\ntheir future and for the future of their children, and a regime that has\nthrived off a conflict in which it has never fired a single shot to\nliberate the Golan Heights from Israeli occupation, regardless of its\npolitical posturing.\n\nAll this leads to the question of whether Netanyahu's new position is\nbased on some type of analysis of the ongoing Arab revolutions.\nDoes he believe that they will turn out to be like their predecessors\nand feed off the Palestinian cause, for example, and has this led him\nto want to deal firmly with them from the outset? Egypt received a\nmessage to the effect that Al-Qaeda was in control of the Sinai and\nthat Israel therefore felt itself free to act as it wishes.\n\nAlternatively, could Netanyahu's thinking be headed in another\ndirection, such that the current Arab revolutions are seeking to rectify\nthe fatal habit of previous revolutions of focussing on external affairs\nat the expense of domestic needs and that they will therefore seek to\navert wars, conflicts and attendant tribulations?\n\nSurely it is no coincidence that a leading Nasserist Arab nationalist\nand presidential candidate, Hamdeen Sabahi, has stated several times\nthat he has no intention of opening hostilities against Israel and every\nintention instead of waging war on poverty and fighting for\neducational and healthcare reforms and other such urgent domestic\ncauses.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018091",
