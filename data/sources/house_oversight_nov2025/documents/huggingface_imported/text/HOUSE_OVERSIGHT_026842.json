  "text": "brutish, and short. Today, life expectancy has increased by leaps and bounds\nvirtually everywhere. Infant and maternal mortality have dropped sharply,\nthanks in part to the spread of clear hygiene standards and the construction\nof modern hospitals. According to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as\nrecently as 1988, polio was rampant in 125 countries; today that number is\ndown to two. Aside from among the Taliban and a few pockets of upscale\ncommunities in the United States, the virtues of vaccines are accepted by all,\npart of a general consensus on the virtues of Western science and\ntechnology.\n\nAnd reason is replacing superstition more generally. People around the\nworld now routinely do basic cost-benefit analyses when looking for\nsolutions to problems, leading to a gradual improvement in outcomes\neverywhere, from agriculture and construction to social and political life.\nThis helps explain the dramatic long-term decline in the rates of most kinds\nof conflict and violence that the Harvard scholar Steven Pinker has\ndocumented.\n\nAfter slavery and imprisonment, the most degrading condition a human\nbeing can experience is poverty. In 2000, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nannounced as one of the ambitious Millennium Development Goals halving\nextreme global poverty by 2015. That goal was far exceeded, and the U.S.\nNational Intelligence Council has predicted that extreme poverty will be\nreduced even further by 2030-which would constitute one of the most\nremarkable developments in human history. The global middle class,\nmeanwhile, is projected to rise from 1.8 billion in 2009 to 3.2 billion in\n2020 and 4.9 billion in 2030. The world's infant mortality rate decreased\nfrom an estimated 63 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 32 in 2015. This\ntranslates into more than four million fewer infant deaths each year.\n\nInstead of optimism based on this recent progress, however, these days in\nthe West, one more often encounters pessimism related to three current\nchallenges: turbulence in the Islamic world, the rise of China, and intra-\nWestern economic and political sclerosis. But the pessimism is\nunwarranted, because none of these three challenges is insurmountable.\n\nMODERNIZING MUSLIMS\n\nThe Islamic world, from Morocco to Indonesia, comprises 1.6 billion\ncitizens-more than one in five people on the planet. The vast majority of\nthem share the common global aspirations to modernize their societies,\nachieve middle-class living standards, and lead peaceful, productive, and\nfulfilling lives.\n\nContrary to what some assert, Islam is fully compatible with modernization.\nWhen Malaysia built the Petronas Towers and Dubai built Burj Khalifa, they\nwere not just erecting physical structures but also sending a metaphysical\nmessage: we want to be part of the modern world in all dimensions. Many\nIslamic societies have educated their women. In Malaysian universities, the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026842",
