The eight residences in this newly redeveloped\nRegency terrace happen to be on the market at the moment and, with the Frieze Art Fair taking place a stone’s\nthrow away in Regent’s Park, this was a perfect opportunity to entice wealthy collectors to view a potential home\nor pied-a-terre.\n\nThe House of the Noble Man is supposed to evoke the home of a fictitious 21st century merchant — a digital\ntycoon, trader and investor who collects art as a way of lending materiality to his otherwise transient and\nethereal existence.\n\nOnly the best will do in this sort of setting and curators Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria Golembiovskaya\nmanaged to procure an astonishing selection of pieces including paintings, sculpture and installation works by\nYves Klein, Alexander Calder, Gerhard Richter, Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin and Banksy.\n\nContemporary design furniture from Carpenters Workshop Gallery helped to remind the visitor that you were ina\nhome rather than a gallery.\n\nAlso included in the presentation were the works of the four finalists from Channel 4 and the Saatchi Gallery’s\nNew Sensations 2010, a prize for artists graduating from UK art courses.\n\nIt would be impossible not to be impressed by the ambition and quality of this presentation and it certainly\nprovided a refreshingly serene and luxurious experience in comparison to the mélée down the road at Frieze.\nHowever, there was something uncomfortable about viewing all of this wonderful art in what was, in essence, the\nworld’s most expensive show home. | guess the true success of this exhibition will be determined by whether any\nof the properties sell and, for me, art should be treated as more than a sales tool.\n\n34\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028314",
