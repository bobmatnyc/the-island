For millennia, humans have consumed\ncannabis for therapeutic, medicinal, social or spiritual purposes and have used the seeds and fibrous\nstalks of the cannabis plant to produce goods such as rope, paper, clothing and soap.\n\nThere are at least three principal cannabis species: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis\nruderalis.' These three species can be distinguished by their plant structures and leaves. Sativa plants are\ngenerally tall, thin and wispy; indica plants tend to be shorter and bushier than sativa plants; and rud-\neralis plants are shaggy and the shortest of all three species. The following pictures depict the Cannabis\nsativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis plants and their leaves.\n\nCannabis Sativa Plant Cannabis Indica Plant Cannabis Ruderalis Plant\n\n‘Botanists disagree about whether sativa, indica and ruderalis are distinct species or are instead distinct subspecies of a single plant\nspecies. Some botanists propose renaming these three species to reflect their geographic origins. This report takes no position on\nthese botanical debates; it merely adopts one set of commonly used nomenclature.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 15\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024651",
