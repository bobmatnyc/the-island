It is believed to have\nseveral medicinal benefits, such as antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal and anti-ischemic, and a thera-\npeutic application as a bronchodilator. Caryophyllene is found in many plants, including Thai basil,\ncloves, cinnamon leaves and black pepper.\n\nHumulene: Humulene is well known for giving beer its hoppy aroma and is believed to have several\nmedicinal benefits: antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antitumor. Humulene is used to aid weight\nloss by acting as an anorectic (appetite suppressant). It is also found in hops and coriander.\n\nLimonene: Limonene is recognized for its citrusy smell. Its medicinal benefits are believed to include\nantianxiety, antibacterial, anticancer, anticonvulsive, antidepressant and antifungal. Limonene present\nin cannabis quickly enters the bloodstream upon inhalation, which may facilitate the quick absorption\nof other terpenes and thus contribute to an uplifting experience. Limonene is also present in citrus fruit\nrinds, rosemary, juniper, peppermint and pine needle oils, and its strong smell serves as a natural insect\nrepellent.\n\nLinalool: Linalool has floral and lavender aromas. It is believed to have medicinal benefits that\ninclude antibacterial, antidepressant, antifungal and anti-insomnia. Linalool may also counteract anx-\niety induced by THC consumption. Some research suggests that linalool may boost the immune sys-\ntem, reduce lung inflammation and restore cognitive and emotional function (potentially making it\nuseful in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease). Linalool is found naturally in hundreds of plants and is\na common ingredient in bath products.\n\nMyrcene: Myrcene is generally the most abundant terpene found in cannabis and is known for its\nmusky and earthy herbal smell, comparable to the smell of cloves. Myrcene is believed to have several\nmedicinal benefits, including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic.\nMyrcene is understood to enable and hasten the psychoactive effect of THC by lowering resistance\nposed by the blood-brain barrier and increasing the THC saturation capacity of the CB1 receptors.\nConsuming cannabis with high levels of myrcene may contribute to sedative and relaxing effects suit-\nable for the treatment of insomnia and pain. Myrcene is present in hops, citrus fruits, bay leaves, euca-\nlyptus, wild thyme, lemongrass and many other plants.\n\nPinene: Pinene is known for its pine and fir aromas and is believed to have medicinal benefits, such\nas antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory, and a therapeutic application as a bronchodilator.\nPinene has shown potential to function as an anticancer agent and is believed to counter some of the\npsychoactive effects of THC. Pinene is present in conifers, pine resin and citrus fruits and is one of the\nterpenes most prevalent in nature.\n\nTerpinolene: Terpinolene has a piney aroma and subtle herbal and sweet floral scents similar to\ncitrus fruits. Terpinolene is believed to have medicinal benefits, including antibacterial, antifungal,\nanti-insomnia and antiseptic. It is also thought to be a central nervous system depressant and is used\nto induce sleep or reduce psychological distress. Terpinolene is found in sage and rosemary and is used\nin soaps and perfumes.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 25\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024661",
