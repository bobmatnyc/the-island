When Chap-\nman returned to Moscow after a spy exchange, she was taken to\na well-publicized dinner with Putin. Afterward, she informed her\ndebriefer at the SVR that only Poteyev had been in a position to\nknow the password that an FBI agent had used to try to deceive\nher into believing she was speaking to an SVR officer. This brought\nPoteyev under immediate suspicion. Tipped off by the CIA to the\nFBI's error, Poteyev managed to escape by taking a train from Mos-\ncow to Belarus, where the CIA exfiltrated him to the United States.\nPoteyev had been saved from prison—or worse—but he was no lon-\nger useful to the CIA as a mole. Without the services of Poteyev in\nthe SVR in Moscow, U.S. intelligence was unable to find out further\ndetails about the mission to which Poteyev’s sleeper agents were to\nbe assigned. All it had discovered was the history of the prepara-\ntions for a major espionage revival. It now knew that the SVR had\n\n® installed plumbing in America and that one or more agents in this ®\nnetwork had been activated to handle a possible recruit in the NSA.\nBut without anyone left in the sleeper network to follow and with-\nout an inside source in the SVR, it had no further avenues to fruit-\nfully pursue. The revelation of the sleeper agents had little if any\nother intelligence value.\n\nThe NSA’s own security investigation turned up no evidence of a\nleak at Fort Meade in 2010. That of course doesn’t mean there hadn’t\nbeen one. The Russian intelligence service had demonstrated in the\npast that it was well schooled in covering its tracks in operations\nagainst U.S. communications intelligence. For example, CIA coun-\nterintelligence had learned from a KGB defector in the early 1960s\nthat Russian intelligence had penetrated the cipher room at the U.S.\nembassy in Moscow and, because of this operation, the KGB was able\nto decipher crucial communications. Even so, it failed to find either\nthe perpetrator or any evidence of his existence for more than half\na century. The operation was only definitively revealed by the Rus-\nsian spymaster Sergey Kondrashev in 2007.
