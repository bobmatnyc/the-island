It now knew that the SVR had installed plumbing in America that one or more\nagents in this network had been activated to handle a possible recruit in the NSA. But without\nanyone left in the sleeper network to follow and without an inside source in the SVR, it had no\nfurther avenues to fruitfully pursue. The revelation of the sleeper agents had little, if any, other\nintelligence value.\n\nThe NSA’s own security investigation turned up no evidence of a leak at Fort Meade in 2010.\nThe absence of evidence of a penetration in a security investigation is not in itself evidence of the\nabsence of a penetration. The Russian intelligence service had demonstrated in the past it was\nwell-schooled in covering its tracks in operations against US communications intelligence. For\nexample, CIA counterintelligence had learned from a KGB defector in the early 1960s that\nRussian intelligence had penetrated the cipher room at the US Embassy in Moscow and, because\nof this operation, the KGB was able to decipher crucial communications. Even so, it failed to find\neither the perpetrator or any evidence of his existence for more than a half century. The operation\nwas only definitively revealed by Russian spymaster Sergey Kondrashev in 2007. Tennent\nBagley, who headed the CIA’s Soviet Bloc counterintelligence at the time, late wrote in his book\nthat the ability of Russian intelligence to conceal this penetration for more than a half century\n“broke the record for secret keeping.”\n\nThis Russian ability to penetrate US intelligence was not entirely defeated by America’s\nimplementation of more sophisticated security procedures, such as the polygraph examination and\nextensive background checks. In 1995, only 10 years before Snowden joined it, the CIA's\ninspector general completed a study of the KGB’s use of false defectors to mislead the US\ngovernment from the end of the Cold War in late 1980s through the mid-1990s. It found Russia\nhad dispatched at least half-dozen double agents who provided misleading information to their\nCIA case officers. Because the KGB operation went undetected for nearly a decade, the\ndisinformation prepared in Moscow had been incorporated into reports, which had a distinctive\nblue stripe to signify their importance, had been provided to the three American Presidents,\nRonald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Even more shocking, in tracing the path of\nthis disinformation, the Inspector General found that the \"senior CIA officers responsible for these\nreports had known that some of their sources for this information were controlled by Russian\nintelligence,” yet they did not inform the President and officials receiving the blue-striped reports,\nthat they had included Russian misinformation. What CIA Director John Deutch called \"an\ninexcusable lapse\" also reflected a form of institutional willful blindness in US intelligence, borne\nout of bureaucratic fear of career embarrassment so well described in LeCarre's spy novels.\nDetecting intelligence failures has, if anything, become even more difficult in the age of the\nanonymous Internet.\n\nThe NSA’s vulnerability to intelligence lapses, which became all too apparent with Snowden,\nhad departed America with a large selection of its most secret documents.
