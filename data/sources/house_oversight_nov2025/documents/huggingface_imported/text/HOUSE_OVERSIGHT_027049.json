But | go it (they even now approved you - they needed to doa\nbackground check believe it or not! — as on that dinner will be president of Austria, Clinton etc) for two tickets — for you\nand your guest for a price that you do not need to buy a table (as they do not sell individual seats).\n\nGuy below is a good friend and he is a CEO of amFAR (amFAR has a joined dinner) — so he helped.\n\nThe nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all party\naccess.\n\n| have the same ones (through Bill).\n| also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so | reached to Kevin for help.\n\nThe price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as | think the regular one for this is 15K and it is hard to get\nit). They will need an email from someone from your office and name a your guest asap.\n\nThe plan for for Vienna | am sending you with my next email!\n\nBoris\n\nFrom: Kevin Frost [mailto\nSent: Monday, May 07, 2012 6:39 AM\n\nTo: Boris Nikolic\n\nSubject: Tix for Jeffrey\n\nImportance: High\n\nBoris:\n\nHere is the information sheet for Jeffrey to buy tickets.
