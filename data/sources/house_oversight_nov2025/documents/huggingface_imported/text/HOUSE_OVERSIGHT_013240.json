  "text": "324 18 Advanced Self-Modification: A Possible Path to Superhuman AGI\n\nWe envision teaching the system to prove theorems via a combination of supervised learning\nand experiential interactive learning, using the Mizar database of mathematical theorems and\nproofs (or some other similar database, if one should be created) (nttp://mizar.org). The\nMizar database consists of a set of “articles,” which are mathematical theorems and proofs\npresented in a complex formal language. The Mizar formal language occupies a fascinating\nmiddle ground: it is high-level enough to be viably read and written by trained humans, but\nit can be unambiguously translated into simpler formal languages such as predicate logic or\nSasha.\n\nCogPrime may be taught to prove theorems by “training” it on the Mizar theorems and\nproofs, and by training it on custom-created Mizar articles specifically focusing on the sorts of\ntheorems useful for self-modification. Creating these articles will not be a trivial task: it will\nrequire proving simple and then progressively more complex theorems about the probabilistic\nsuccess of CogPrime schemata, so that CogPrime can observe one’s proofs and learned from\nthem. Having learned from its training articles what strategies work for proving things about\nsimple compound schemata, it can then reason by analogy to mount attacks on slightly more\ncomplex schemata — and so forth.\n\nClearly, this approach to self-modification is more difficult to achieve than the supercompi-\nlation approach. But it is also potentially much more powerful. Even once the theorem-proving\napproach is working, the supercompilation approach will still be valuable, for making incremen-\ntal improvements on existing schema, and for the peculiar creativity that is contributed when\na modified supercompiled schema is compressed back into a modified schema expression. But,\nwe don’t believe that supercompilation can carry out truly advanced MindAgent learning or\nknowledge-representation modification. We suspect that the most advanced and ambitious goals\nof self-modification probably cannot be achieved except through some variant of the theorem-\nproving approach. If this hypothesis is true, it means that truly advanced self-modification is\nonly going to come after relatively advanced theorem-proving ability. Prior to this, we will have\nschema optimization, schema modification, and occasional creative schema innovation. But re-\nally systematic, high-quality reasoning about schema, the kind that can produce an orders of\nmagnitude improvement in intelligence, is going to require advanced mathematical theorem-\nproving ability.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013240",
