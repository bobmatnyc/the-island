The U.S. Attorney had a last-minute concern, that I think I fixed (it\nis in the first “It Appearing” clause following the list of statutes potentially violated).\n\nAfter you get the green light, let’s discuss the potential representative. The person I am thinking\nof has run a preliminary conflicts check and it looks alright.\n\nAlso, to address Mr. Epstein’s concern regarding the list of names, I wanted to tell you that I\nhave compiled a list of 34 confirmed minors. There are six others, whose names we already\nhave, who need to be interviewed by the FBI to confirm whether they were 17 or 18 at the time\nof their activity with Mr. Epstein. Once those interviews are completed, I can finalize the list of\nidentified victims, which I will put in a formal document that I will maintain until the time of\nMr. Epstein’s sentencing.\n\nAssuming that this agreement is fine, please execute at least three copies, and send one to me by\nfax and the rest by FedEx. I will execute and send the copies back.\n\nThank you.\n\nA. Marie Villafaiia\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney\n\n500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012619",
