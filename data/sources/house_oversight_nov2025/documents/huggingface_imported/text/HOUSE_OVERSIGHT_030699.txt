Yes, yes, that's their continuing resistance speaking. But that doesn't change the fact that it is their ONLY
option. AND it's a slam-dunk one. She would turn it around. If Dylan is coming out to speak publicly, Soon-Yi
also has to. If Dylan is allowed to be the center of this story, Woody is cooked. If Soon-Y1i claims it--and she is
actually the center of the story--everything shifts and they can make it their own.

yes, he is having what he refers to as his" brain trust"this weekend. but it appears the group needs a name
change. They are all old thinkers. no social media strategy. no links to connecticut report. . the
jackals now lying in wait for the next movie release. which 1 believe cannot happen at all now. but they tell
him what he wants to hear. wonder wheel grossed 7m at the box office. the new movie is young ditz,
prositutes. . drunken journalism student chasing an older guy. . The connecticut ( hired by the state ) report
front page. -- WE interviewed dylan Nine times . two professionals AT THE TIME. we conclude that the
story is fantasy. . NOTHING ELSE is relevant. mia. ronan. motives, policeman views. etc.

Bannon's "nationalist-populist” platform is coherent, rational, and, apparently appealing to a great many
people. I can't see why at this point he wouldn't want to use his world-stage stature to make an argument
for it and to claim leadership of it. What does he have to lose? What else is there, except to suck up to
Trump, and get the chance to be manhandled by him again?
