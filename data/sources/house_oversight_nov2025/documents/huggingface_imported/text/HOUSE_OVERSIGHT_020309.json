In 2013, none of\nthese other countries had a global network of geosynchronous sensors in outer space and under\nthe ocean that could monitor signals from missile launching, submarine, military deployments,\nnuclear tests and other matters of strategic importance to them. Nor did these allies have the\ncipher-breaking capabilities of the array of NSA super computers. The NSA had assiduously\nbuilt these means at a cost of over a half trillion dollars and employed tens of thousands of\nlinguists who could translate almost any dialect or language of interest.\n\nEven though these allies had their own ciphers services and local capabilities they depended on\nNSA to provide them a large share of their signal intelligence. From the perspective of defending\nthemselves from potential threats, the deal that these allies had with NSA was a mutually-\nadvantageous.\n\nThe NSA’s overseas intelligence gathering was not limited to adversary nations. With the\nexception of the Five-Eye allies, it gathered data that was deemed of importance by the President\nand Defense Department in friendly countries. These operations had been approved by every\nAmerican President, and funded by every American Congress, since 1941. After all, even in the\nrealm of allies, activities take place that run counter to American interests. The 911 conspiracy,\nfor example, was hatched in Hamburg, Germany and financed in Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Nor\nwere American allies unaware of the reach of the NSA. “Yes, my continental European friends,\nwe have spied on you. And it is true we use computers to sort through data by using keywords,”\nformer CIA Director James Woolsey wrote in the Wall Street Journal in 2000, “Have you\nstopped to ask yourselves what we are looking for?” Whether or not it was appreciated by other\ncountries, the global harvesting of communication intelligence by the NSA was hardly secret.\n\nAs the NSA expanded further, it delegated part of its work to regional bases, including ones in\nUtah, Texas, Hawaii and Japan. The paramount task of the NSA remained monitoring the\nchannels of communications that an adversary might use. The vast proliferation of these channels\nin cyberspace, which included email, social media, document sharing and other innovations of the\nInternet age, greatly complicated this task. Even so, this challenge was not insurmountable\nbecause most of the Internet actually travelled through fiber-glass land-line cables that crossed the\nterritories of the United States, Britain and Australia. So the NSA found the technical means,\nincluding voluntary gaining access to major Internet companies, to “harvest” vast amounts of this\nInternet data. America’s other intelligence agencies quickly recognized the value of the\ncommunications intelligence gleaned from foreign telecommunications. John E. McLaughlin,\nwho was the CIA’s Acting Director in 2004, described the NSA as nothing less than the “very\nfoundation of US intelligence.” This service proceeded from the immense amount of foreign data\nthat the NSA vacuumed in through its global sensors. This data allowed the CIA and other US\nintelligence services a means for verifying the reports of its human sources as well as discovering\nnew targets in adversary nations for further investigation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020309",
