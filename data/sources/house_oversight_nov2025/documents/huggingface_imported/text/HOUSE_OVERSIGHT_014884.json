For purposes of this Investment Rating Distribution, the coverage universe includes only stocks. A\nstock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.\n\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\n\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\n\nBuy = 10% < 10%\nNeutral 20% = 30%\nUnderperform NIA = 20%\n\n*Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\n\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s\ncoverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.\n\nPrice charts for the securities referenced in this research report are available at http://pricecharts.baml.com, or call 1-800-MERRILL to have them mailed.\n\nPF&S or one of its affiliates acts as a market maker for the equity securities recommended in the report: Hess.\n\nLPF&S or an affiliate was a manager of a public offering of securities of this issuer within the last 12 months: Hess.\n\nThe issuer is or was, within the last 12 months, an investment banking client of MLPF&S and/or one or more of its affiliates: Hess.\n\nLPF&S or an affiliate has received compensation from the issuer for non-investment banking services or products within the past 12 months: Hess.\n\nThe issuer is or was, within the last 12 months, a non-securities business client of MLPF&S and/or one or more of its affiliates: Hess.\n\nLPF&S or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from this issuer within the past 12 months: Hess.\n\nLPF&S or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from this issuer or an affiliate of the issuer within the next three months: Hess.\nLPF&S together with its affiliates beneficially owns one percent or more of the common stock of this issuer.
