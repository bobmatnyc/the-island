By simply\ngoogling Poitras’s name in January 2013, he would have learned\nabout her connections with Greenwald, Appelbaum, Binney,\nAssange, and other leading figures in the anti-surveillance camp.\nWhen asked later by Poitras why he had chosen her to help him,\nSnowden replied, “I didn’t. You chose yourself.” The problem for\nSnowden was anonymously drawing her into his enterprise.\n\nPoitras was living in Berlin in January 2013, which made her vul-\nnerable to NSA surveillance. To get to her through an encrypted\nchannel, Snowden chose a circuitous approach. On January 11, he\nwrote to Micah Lee in Berkeley, California. Given Lee’s residence\nin the United States, as Snowden knew, the NSA would be legally\nbarred from monitoring his communications without a warrant.\nHe used Lee, who was the chief technology officer at the Freedom\nof the Press Foundation, as the encrypted gateway to Poitras. Lee\nwas also well-connected to others whom Snowden had contacted\n\n© for his CryptoParty. Lee had been an associate of Runa Sandvik’s at ®\nTor and was a prominent member of Noisebridge, an eclectic anti-\ngovernment hackers’ commune based in Northern California, of\nwhich Appelbaum was also a member.\n\nTo contact Lee, Snowden chose the alias Anon1o8. Anon is an\nalias frequently used by members of the Anonymous commune\nof hacktivists. “I’m a friend,” Snowden wrote to Lee. “I need to get\ninformation securely to Laura Poitras and her alone, but I can’t find\nan email gpg key for her.” The “gpg” encryption key he asked for,\nmore commonly called a PGP key, was the so-called public key for\nan encryption system called Pretty Good Privacy, or, for short, PGP.\nThis encryption system required both a public and a private key.\nSnowden asked Lee to provide the former one, because Poitras had\nthe latter one. Lee wrote to Poitras about Anon1o8. The next day,\nwith the approval of Poitras, Lee supplied Poitras’s public key to\nSnowden, or, as he knew him, Anon108.\n\nWith it, Snowden contacted Poitras directly. He asked her as a first\nstep to open an anonymous e-mail account using Tor software. Poi-\ntras later wrote about this initial contact, “I was at that point film-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 63 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019551",
