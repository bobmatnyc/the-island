  "text": "\"Federal Judge throws out Stormy Danials [sic] lawsuit versus Trump. Trump is entitled to full legal fees.’\n@FoxNews Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas. She will\nconfirm the letter she signed! She knows nothing about me, a total con!' he tweeted.\n\nThe tweet comes one day after a federal judge in California threw out Daniels's defamation lawsuit against\nTrump and ordered Daniels to repay the president's legal fees.\n\nDaniels's attorney, Michael Avenatti, responded by calling Trump a \"disgusting misogynist\" and a \"liar\" who\nhas dishonored his family and country.\n\n\"You are a disgusting misogynist and an embarrassment to the United States. Bring everything you have,\nbecause we are going to demonstrate to the world what a complete shyster and liar you are. How many other\nwomen did you cheat on your wife with while you had a baby at home?\" he tweeted.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031769",
