She is very close friend with mette as well. \nEva and I are still trying to get mette to join at the last moment. \nShe and her family own 80% or so of Austrian media (Heute etc). She is describing program below. \nThe plan would be that we arrive to Vienna on Thursday 17th mid day. \nOn Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La clemenza de Tito and we go to that. \nON Friday Eva is organizing a dinner/reception with her friends. We can schedule some other \nmeetings/visits during day. \nOn Saturday the night starts at 5pm and goes through early next morning. \nleave first flight Sunday morning for San Francisco to meet Bill. \nIf you are staying in Vienna and have time (and like Eva) you should go to her brunch. \nHow this seems to you??? \n-----Original message----- \nFrom: Eva pichand [mailto: \nSent: Monday, May 07, 2012 5:51 AM \nTo: 'Cavan mahony'; Boris Nikolic; __________________________________________ \nSubject: WG: zeitplan amfar Gala 19.5.2012 \nHallo everybody! \nAttached (sorry in Germain) the Programm fort he lifeball on the 19th. \nActually there will be a Galadinner with our prime minister and Bill Clinton and all kinds of stars in \nthe Hofburg (former imerial estate - very impressive to see from inside)) It is only 250 people,.

People now don't wear Tuxedos anymore. \nchristoph wear's normal black trouseres with a white shirt and a dar sakko because he doesn't want to be \nin any crazy stuff on all the pics. Half oft he people oft he gala dinenr also waer some 'little' crazy \nstuff like pink velvet sakkos (and a mask for later) or so. girls: crazy as you like. There are a lot of \natrists that are really dressed up. i will wear a quiet see-through short dress with high high heels+ a \nchanel Tatoo and will take a face mask fort he ball later. \nSo i hope this helped at least a little bit.
