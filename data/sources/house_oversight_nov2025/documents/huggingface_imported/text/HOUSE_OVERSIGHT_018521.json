  "text": "I've heard from a few other BDSM submissives that they like feeling anger during their\nencounters, that they need anger in order to get where they want to go.\n\nIf I follow the thread of anger, now....\n\nWhere will it take me?\n\nKK Ok\nThis post can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/12/26/anger-fear-and-pain/\n\nEVOLUTION:\n[theory] Sexual Openness: Two Ways To Encourage It\nThis was written in 2010, and it amazes me how I've changed since then.\n\nI don't like to talk about people being \"further along\" in their sexual experimentation\nthan others; people are simply in different places, based on their preferences and\nexperiences. I look at this piece now and I think that maybe it would be better-written if\nId tried to talk about sexual evolution in a more neutral way. However, it's undeniable\nthat when I was younger, I often felt like I was somehow \"held up\" or \"inhibited,\" and I\nno longer feel that way about sex. And I do think that in general, lots of people want to\nexplore but aren't sure how to overcome their own hesitance and psychological blocks.\nSome of them even write to me for advice, and I can only tell them what worked for me:\nthe approach I outlined in this post.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nSexual Openness: Two Ways To Encourage It\n\nI've been thinking a lot lately about the factors that went into my sexual evolution. People\nhave always seen me as sexually open-minded, and I had an extraordinarily liberal\nupbringing... but at the same time, I think I spent a long time surprisingly buttoned-up.\n\nPart of it was the men I fell in love with, the partners I had. Monogamy felt right to me,\nand that effectively meant that once I was in a relationship, it was hard to explore\nsexuality beyond what my lovers were comfortable with. I've often looked back in\nfrustration at sexual shame and inhibitions that I feel were imposed on me by some past\npartners. But at the same time, there's no denying that -- even when my partners were\nrelatively inhibited -- I was with those men partly because I felt comfortable with\nthem. I recall conversations in which I felt frustrated at a lover's unwillingness to explore\nor discuss certain things... but I also recall times when I felt relieved that they were\nwilling to leave those things alone.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018521",
