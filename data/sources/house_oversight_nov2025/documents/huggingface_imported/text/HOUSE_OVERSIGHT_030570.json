I will call her again today. my suggestion for T is out of the box ( how unusual ).. 1. I\nstill think that the only really qualified person is Jamie. knowledge of system, ddreivatives. banking operations\nboth domestic and intl. . Personality issues are the key. ..AS that seems diofficult 2. I THink it would\nbehoove Obama to make Bill CLinton Treasury sec.. and move Hillary out. of state. , Bill will be able to\nexplain to the public and he world complex issues.. Unlike Jamie he could not craft them, but in todays internet\n\nworld the message and how itis delivered is as important..\n\n3s 2s 2s fe 2s fs 24s ois 24s ois 2fe fs fe 2s ois 24s ois fe of 2s 2s ois 2fe ois fe os fe 2s ois 2fe ois 2s fs fe 2c ois 2fe ois fe 2fs fe ois ois 2fe ois 2fe 2s fe 2s ois 2fe ok 2fe os oie 2k ois 2 ok\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
