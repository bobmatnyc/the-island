It comes back, not unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money:\n\n“At a certain level of finance, almost everyone is allied with an\ninstitutional interest. You are part of government, or you want to be in\ngovernment, or you are connected to a bank or other portfolio, or you have\nkey relationships with certain corporations or industries. Because of my\nsituation, I have none of that. I have no institutional bona fides which makes\nme in some sense one of the few independent sources of information and\nactual honest brokers. That’s the usefulness of disgrace.”\n\nAnd then there is too, that he is right. Since I began working on this\npiece in September, Epstein predictions about the price of oil, the Euro, and\nthe Danish Krone have all born out.\n\nAnd something else, which perhaps also surely accounts for Epstein’s\ncontinuing relationships with the rich and powerful.\n\nMost everyone who is now of a certain age and certain ambition and\ncertain status grew up in, and found they were temperamentally suited to the\nnew age of wealth that started in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids,\nor, as Vanity Fair would baldly and ingratiatingly dub it, the new\nestablishment, an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at further\nand further remove from the ordinary one. In some sense, Epstein is just one\nversion, picaresque, as well as louche, of this shared story.\n\nEpstein was born in 1953 in Coney Island. His father worked for the\ncity’s Parks Department. His mother was a housewife. He has a younger\nbrother, Mark. Epstein was distinguished by little other than his math talents.\nThe captain of the math team at Lafayette High school in Bensonhurst, goes\non to Cooper Union where the tuition is free. He drops out after two years\nand begins taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematics.\nThen, without a college degree, hence by slight of hand or deft\nmisrepresentation, gets a job teaching math and physics at Dalton in 1974.\n\nIt’s his first exposure to the wealthy. They have, he concludes, just as\nmany problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost\ninvariably involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a science\nexperiment,” he recalled not long ago as we chatted about his life. “It did not\nreally involve me. I could just stand back and watch.”\n\nDalton fathers were attracted to him.
