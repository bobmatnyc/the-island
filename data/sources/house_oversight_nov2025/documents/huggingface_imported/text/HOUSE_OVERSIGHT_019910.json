  "text": "illegitimate.\n\nTrump was not a politician who could parse factions of support and opprobrium; he\nwas a salesman who needed to make a sale. “I won. I am the winner. I am not the loser,”\nhe repeated, incredulously, like a mantra.\n\nBannon described Trump as a simple machine. The On switch was full of flattery, the\nOff switch full of calumny. The flattery was dripping, slavish, cast in ultimate\nsuperlatives, and entirely disconnected from reality: so-and-so was the best, the most\nincredible, the ne plus ultra, the eternal. The calumny was angry, bitter, resentful, ever a\ncasting out and closing of the iron door.\n\nThis was the nature of Trump’s particular salesmanship. His strategic belief was that\nthere was no reason not to heap excessive puffery on a prospect. But if the prospect was\nruled out as a buyer, there was no reason not to heap scorn and lawsuits on him or her.\nAfter all, if they don’t respond to sucking up, they might respond to piling on. Bannon felt\n—perhaps with overconfidence—that Trump could be easily switched on and off.\n\nAgainst the background of a mortal war of wills—with the media, the Democrats, and\nthe swamp—that Bannon was encouraging him to wage, Trump could also be courted. In\nsome sense, he wanted nothing so much as to be courted.\n\nAmazon’s Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, which had become one of the\nmany Trump media bétes noires in the media world, nevertheless took pains to reach out\nnot only to the presidentelect but to his daughter Ivanka. During the campaign, Trump said\nAmazon was getting “away with murder taxwise” and that if he won, “Oh, do they have\nproblems.” Now Trump was suddenly praising Bezos as “a top-level genius.” Elon Musk,\nin Trump Tower, pitched Trump on the new administration’s joining him in his race to\nMars, which Trump jumped at. Stephen Schwarzman, the head of the Blackstone Group—\nand a Kushner friend—offered to organize a business council for Trump, which Trump\nembraced. Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor and fashion industry queen, had hoped to be\nnamed America’s ambassador to the UK under Obama and, when that didn’t happen,\nclosely aligned herself with Hillary Clinton. Now Wintour arrived at Trump Tower (but\nrefused to do the perp walk) and suggested that she become Trump’s ambassador to the\nCourt of St. James’s. And Trump was inclined to entertain the idea. (“Fortunately,” said\nBannon, “there was no chemistry.”’)\n\nOn December 14, a high-level delegation from Silicon Valley came to Trump Tower to\nmeet the president-elect, though Trump had repeatedly criticized the tech industry\nthroughout the campaign. Later that afternoon, Trump called Rupert Murdoch, who asked\nhim how the meeting had gone.\n\n“Oh, great, just great,” said Trump. “Really, really good. These guys really need my\nhelp. Obama was not very favorable to them, too much regulation. This is really an\nopportunity for me to help them.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019910",
