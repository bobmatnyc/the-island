M.V. “Americana,” 734 F.2d 115\n(2d Cir.1984), mandates the finding that\nthe PIF is a political subdivision of the\nKingdom. In O'Connell, the Second Cir-\ncuit reasoned that the legislative history of\nthe FSIA indicated that “political subdivi-\nsions” were intended to include “all gov-\nernmental units beneath the central gov-\nernment.” Jd. (quoting H.R.Rep. No.\n1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 15, reprinted in,\n1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6613). Given the\nPIF’s position under the Ministry of Fi-\nnance, O'Connell could lead to the conclu-\nsion that the PIF is a political subdivision\nof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Jd.; but\nsee In re Ski Train Fire, 198 F.Supp.2d at\n425 n. 9 (distinguishing O’Connell on\ngrounds that the court based its holding on\na finding that the Italian government dou-\nble-tiered its administrative agencies);\nAyatt, 945 F.Supp. at 683-84 (finding defi-\nnition of “political subdivision” in O’Con-\nnell too broad and suggesting the case\nshould be limited to its facts and not ap-\nplied widely). In the twenty years since\nO'Connell was decided, however, courts\nhave been inclined to limit the FSIA’s\ngrant of immunity. See, eg., Dole Food,\n538 U.S. at 4738-74, 128 8.Ct. 1655; Filler,\n378 F.3d at 218. Accordingly, the Court\nwill not rely on O'Connell here.\n\nb. Limited Jurisdictional Discovery\nis Warranted\n\n[13] The Court finds that resolution of\nthe PIF’s and thereby NCB’s status is not\ndeterminable on the current record and,\ntherefore, limited jurisdictional discovery\nis warranted. As explained above, the\nPIF could qualify either as an organ or\npolitical subdivision of the Kingdom of Sa-\nudi Arabia. Additionally, the affidavits on\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nwhich the parties ask the Court to rely\nhave not been subjected to cross examina-\ntion and are rather self-serving. The par-\nties should have the opportunity to take\ndiscovery of the jurisdictionally relevant\nfacts. First City, 150 F.3d at 177; see also\nIn re Magnetic Audiotape Antitrust Litig.,\n334 F.3d 204, 208 (2d Cir.2003) Gnstructing\ndistrict court to permit discovery before\ngranting motion to dismiss based on fact-\nsensitive, multi-factor test). Accordingly,\nNCB’s motion to dismiss for lack of sub-\nject matter jurisdiction based on the FSIA\nis denied without prejudice. Limited ju-\nrisdictional discovery will be permitted to\nexplore PIF’s function, organizational\nstructure, and place within the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia.\n\nD. Application of FSIA Exceptions\nto the Princes and Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia\n\nThree exceptions to foreign sovereign\nimmunity are implicated in these mo-\ntions—the commercial activities exception,\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2), the state sponsor of\nterrorism exception, 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(7), and the torts exception, 28\nU.S.C. § 1605(a)(5).\n\n1. Commercial Activities Exception\n\n[14] Section 1605(a)(2) states:\nA foreign state shall not be immune ...\nin any case ... in which the action is\nbased ... upon an act performed in the\nUnited States in connection with a com-\nmercial activity of the foreign state else-\nwhere; or upon an act outside the terri-\ntory of the United States in connection\nwith a commercial activity of the foreign\nstate elsewhere and that act causes a\ndirect effect in the United States.\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)@2). The statute de-\nfines “commercial activity” as “either a\nregular course of commercial conduct or a\nparticular commercial transaction or act.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017857",
