The proposed\nlegislation, as drafted, would eliminate the Department’s role in several important steps in the\nvictim identification process, and thereby negatively impact our ability to ensure the safety of\nvictims and their families, rescue additional victims, and apprehend and prosecute human\ntraffickers; it would broaden the criminal statutes regarding prosecution in a manner that detracts\nfrom effective enforcement efforts and raises serious federalism implications; and it would\nunconstitutionally intrude into Executive authority.\n\n1.

Otherwise,\nserious issues could arise that would complicate or even scutile prosecution. For example, any\nstatements made to the Director would presumptively have to be turned over to the defense and\nany statements that contradict statements made to law enforcement or prosecutors would be\nrequired to be turned over to the defense.\n\n2. Section 103\n\nDOJ finds section 103 unnecessary and duplicative of existing efforts and, therefore,\nopposes its inclusion in the bill. DOJ and other Federal agencies are already offering the types\nof assistance that are described in the section. Furthermore, the new subsection (a)()(3) would\nrequire the United States Government to provide “technical assistance to provide legal\nframeworks and other programs to foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012372",
