  "text": "actual, on-the-ground improvements. This would not necessarily make\nEgypt worse off, but it could further weaken the economy as revenue from\nkey industries, such as tourism, continues to decline. It would not improve\nconditions either, as improvements, unfortunately, take longer that the\nvoting public generally likes. The potential upshot of this option is that,\nhopefully, over time, mass action would become more and more cohesive\nand leaders start to emerge from the morass. This would bring developed\npolitical parties into Egypt’s political system and potentially, leaders from\noutside the military and the elite as well. This, however, will remain only a\ntemporary option. Revolutions, or even mass action, are difficult to\nmaintain over time. Moreover, if some improvements, particularly\neconomic improvements, do occur, the majority of the country will\nacquiesce to a nondemocratic government. The best example of this is the\nChinese government, which has managed economic growth without any\naccompanying political liberalization. Eventually, either a government\nwill improve conditions for the average Egyptian, or it will become so\nrepressive that mass action ceases to be a viable option. The third option is\na total crackdown on any and all political movements and the return of a\nrepressive and autocratic government. The impetus behind this path is the\nidea that establishing stability is the first and foremost priority of the\ngovernment. If you establish stability, the rest will follow. Or, if the\ngovernment is truly cynical, it simply does not care what happens as long\nas the ruler and his or her cronies are taken care of. Right now, it looks as\nthough Egypt has chosen to go with option three, the return to repression\nunder military rule. The first step for any autocracy is to get a firm grip on\nthe political process, weeding out the opposition. This is precisely what\n\nhas been occurring. Massive repression of the Muslim Brotherhood is the\nmost obvious example of this process. While there are some legitimate\n\nsecurity concerns regarding the Muslim Brotherhood ties to ongoing\nviolence, banning the entire organization and labeling them all as terrorists\nis like using a sledgehammer on a nail—overkill and likely to create a\nmess. It does, however, have the benefit of getting the only meaningful\npolitical party out of the current political scene and that is a key step in\npolitical consolidation. Other examples of consolidation abound, including\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031571",
