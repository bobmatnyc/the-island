  "text": "Liberation Front. You’ ve probably seen their frontline members on the\nstreet and in airports, selling little cards with the sign-language alphabet.\nSome have been getting arrested for being deaf without a license.\nNaturally, the police recite their Miranda rights, shouting, “You have the\nright to remain silent!\n\nAnyway, this particular Ex-Lax commercial features a pleasant,\nmatronly woman reminiscing through her family photo album while a\nyoung fellow in the corner of the screen ostensibly translates the message\ninto sign language. Actually, he can say whatever he wants. Nobody\nmonitors his translation. He can indulge in private jokes for all the deaf\nviewers and only they will know.\n\nThe matronly woman in the Ex-Lax commercial says: “Thank God\nmy family is normal” The young fellow shifts the emphasis slightly in his\ntranslation: “Thank God her family is normal.” She continues: “Of\ncourse, once in a while somebody in our family will be troubled by\nirregularity.” He translates: “No shit.” She concludes: “So then we do\nwhat we’ ve done in our family for generations—we turn to an old friend,\nEx-Lax.” He translates: “Jimmy Hoffa knows too much.”\n\nAnd while the hearing-impaired at home _ giggle at_ this\n\nmistranslation, all over the globe the shit continues to hit the fans.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015177",
