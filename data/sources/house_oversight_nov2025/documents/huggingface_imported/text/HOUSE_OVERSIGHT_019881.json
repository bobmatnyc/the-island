With the inauguration of Donald\nTrump on January 20, 2017, the United States entered the eye of the most extraordinary\npolitical storm since at least Watergate. As the day approached, I set out to tell this story in\nas contemporaneous a fashion as possible, and to try to see life in the Trump White House\nthrough the eyes of the people closest to it.\n\nThis was originally conceived as an account of the Trump administration’s first\nhundred days, that most traditional marker of a presidency. But events barreled on without\nnatural pause for more than two hundred days, the curtain coming down on the first act of\nTrump’s presidency only with the appointment of retired general John Kelly as the chief of\nstaff in late July and the exit of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon three weeks later.\n\nThe events I’ve described in these pages are based on conversations that took place\nover a period of eighteen months with the president, with most members of his senior staff\n—some of whom talked to me dozens of times—and with many people who they in turn\nspoke to. The first interview occurred well before I could have imagined a Trump White\nHouse, much less a book about it, in late May 2016 at Trump’s home in Beverly Hills—\nthe then candidate polishing off a pint of Haagen-Dazs vanilla as he happily and idly\nopined about a range of topics while his aides, Hope Hicks, Corey Lewandowski, and\nJared Kushner, went in and out of the room. Conversations with members of the\ncampaign’s team continued through the Republican Convention in Cleveland, when it was\nstill hardly possible to conceive of Trump’s election. They moved on to Trump Tower with\na voluble Steve Bannon—before the election, when he still seemed like an entertaining\noddity, and later, after the election, when he seemed like a miracle worker.\n\nShortly after January 20, I took up something like a semipermanent seat on a couch in\nthe West Wing. Since then I have conducted more than two hundred interviews.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has made hostility to the press a virtual policy, it has\nalso been more open to the media than any White House in recent memory. In the\nbeginning, I sought a level of formal access to this White House, something of a fly-on-\nthe-wall status. The president himself encouraged this idea. But, given the many fiefdoms\nin the Trump White House that came into open conflict from the first days of the\nadministration, there seemed no one person able to make this happen. Equally, there was\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019881",
