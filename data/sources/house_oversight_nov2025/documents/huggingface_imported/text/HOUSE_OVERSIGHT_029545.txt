Importance: — High

Understand the two negatives are still present. We are still on track per our last call of 60 days from 1/10 if we
can get the placement out next week Christina is preparing for us and results continue to respond as they have
been.

It takes 30 days for Google to respond in most cases and we ramped up 28 days ago with boosting alternate
URLs per our call

We are working very hard to make this happen and should have Christina set up to support us with columns on
a few top sites at no cost moving forward

lam available for a call now or this weekend to review.
