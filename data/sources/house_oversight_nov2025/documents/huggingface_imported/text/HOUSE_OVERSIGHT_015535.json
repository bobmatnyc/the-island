To avoid her deposition, Maxwell claimed that her mother fell deathly ill and that\nconsequently she was leaving the United States for London with no plans of ever returning. In\nfact, however, within weeks of using that excuse to avoid testifying, Maxwell had returned to\nNew York.\n\n22. In 2011, two FBI agents located Giuffre in Australia—where she had been hiding\nfrom Epstein and Maxwell for several years—and arranged to meet with her at the US.\nConsulate in Sidney. Guuffre provided truthful and accurate information to the FBI about\nEpstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse.\n\n23. | Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Giuffre believed that\nshe should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had also\nsuffered from sexual trafficking and abuse.\n\n24. On December 23, 2014, Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims\nRefuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation.\n\n25. Giuffre intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against\nsexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues to be, to\nhelp survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of\nsexual abuse. Giuffre has now dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex\ntrafficking.\n\n26. On December 30, 2014, Giuffre moved to join the on-going litigation previously\nfiled by Jane Doe 1 in the Southern District of Florida challenging Epstein’s non-prosecution\n\nagreement by filing her own joinder motion.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015535",
