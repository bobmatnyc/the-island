  "text": "like to pass along--they can be largely eliminated with, of all things, Visine\neye drops. But pubic hair is practical; serves as a cushion against friction.\n\nThe porn industry has played an important part in shaping pubic\nstyles. Jordan Stein writes in an article titled Has Porn Gone Mainstream?:\n\n‘Consider the near icon status the female porn star has achieved. She is\nsO mainstream that even good girls are imitating her various styles of\nundress, disappearing hair and all. Porn chic? You bet.”\n\nHowever, Julia Baird writes in Celebrity Porn. “The idea that the\nfashion industry can strip, then exhibit women in the name of ‘porn\nchic,’ is a bit silly, frankly. But ‘flesh is the new fabric’ could be the new\ncatch-cry. Americans call their bush George W. It’ s fashionable--the\ncurious fact is that it is fueled by the porn aesthetic that celebrities love to\nlove.”\n\nAmong Hollywood actresses, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kirstie Alley have\nboth admitted favoring Brazilian wax jobs, where most of their pubic hair is\nremoved, leaving a small tuft that remains hidden under a thong bikini.\nSara Jessica Parker’ s character, Carrie Bradshaw, had her pubic hair\nremoved during the third season of Sex /n the City. Presumably, it’ s now\nin the Smithsonian museum along with Archie Bunker’ s easy chair and\n\nthe Fonz’ s leather jacket.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015344",
