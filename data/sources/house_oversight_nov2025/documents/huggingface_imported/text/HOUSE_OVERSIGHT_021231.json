And as wretched as the\nU.S. economy seems, it's not as bad as in other regions.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund's latest tally of world economic conditions forecasts a 2.6 decline in U.S. economic output for all of\n2009, and anemic growth of 0.8 percent in 2010. That's more optimistic than the IMF's prediction from three months ago, but those\nare still lousy numbers. A weak economy throughout 2010 would mean a bleak employment picture, an agonizingly slow housing\nrecovery, and another year or two likely to feel like a recession, whether it's technically labeled that or not.\nWe should count ourselves lucky, though. The IMF expects at least 11 major parts of the world to have more severe economic\ncontractions than the United State this year, including most of western Europe, Japan, Russia, and Mexico. Europe will still be\nstumbling along behind the United States next year, as well. Here are the IMF's projections for economic growth in various parts of\nthe world:\n\n2009. 2010\nChina. 75. 85\nIndia. 54 65\nMiddle East 2.0 3.7\nAfrica. 1.8 4.7\nBrazil. -1.3 2.5\nWorld total -1.4 2.5\nCanada. -2.3 1.6\nUS. -2.6 0.8\nFrance. -3.0 0.4\nSpain. -4.0 -0.8\nU.K. 4.2 0.2\n\nEU. -4.7 -0.1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021231",
