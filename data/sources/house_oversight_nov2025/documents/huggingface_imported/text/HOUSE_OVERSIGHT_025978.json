This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nUS\nQuantifying the (bond-equity correlation) risks to risk parity\nLast week’s sharp sell-off in JGBs renewed concerns of forced selling by risk parity\nfunds. While the drawdowns in US Treasuries, US equities, and ultimately risk parity\nportfolios were small and short-lived, the latent risk remains worth monitoring, as (i)\nleverage is still near max levels across a variety of risk parity parametrizations, (ii) bond\nallocations are historically elevated, and (iii) markets continue to be sceptical of a 2016\nFed hike. Hence we provide a simple scenario tool to help investors assess what relative\nmoves in bonds and equities could catalyse significant deleveraging by rules-based risk\nparity funds running vol target overlays. For example, a -2% daily decline in the S&P\n500 coupled with a -0.6% fall in 10y Treasury prices (poor diversification) could trigger a\n25% deleveraging (of unlevered notional) today, whereas a -4% SPX drop and +1% bond\nrally (good diversification) would generate no selling pressure, underscoring the critical\nrole played by bond-equity correlation in governing the severity of risk parity unwinds.\nEurope\nBuy the seasonal oil dip via bullish X-market risk reversals\nSelling rich USO (WTI tracker) 3M 25d puts to fund cheaper SXEP (European Oil & Gas\nequity) calls is historically attractive. Indeed the number (>2) of long SXEP calls per short\nUSO put is in the 90 th %-ile since 2008. The trade leverages both our commodity\nstrategists’ ‘buy the dip’ view and our equity strategists’ bullish outlook on the Oil & Gas\nsector, which has been the worst performing over the last 1M. Moreover, the average\npayoff of being long SXEP 3M 25d calls would have been >2x greater than USO 3M 25d\ncalls (owing to more frequent positive returns), when sized for the same upfront cost.\nAsia\nOwn NKY Sep/Oct calendar call at vol hit YTD low level going into the Sep BOJ\nPost the Jul-16 BoJ and the announcement of a ¥28.1tn fiscal stimulus package, NKY and\nUSDJPY 1M vols have dropped to near YTD low levels, both USDJPY and NKY 2M-1M\nterm structures are historically steep, pricing in a slow summer. Our strategists believe\nSep-16 BoJ’s will likely create uncertainty, however, NKY Sep-Oct ATM fwd vol currently\ntrades at the low end of its trading range going into BoJ’s YTD. Plus, our analysis\nsuggests a further squeeze in yield will likely be positive for the NKY. We recommend\nbuying 1x NKY Oct 17500 call vs. selling 0.65x Sep 17250 call.\nTrade update: Closing the NKY Aug/Sep put calendar trade at 0.28% premium\nKorean auto-callable issuance slightly rose while NKY Uridashi issuance fell in July\n>> Employed by a non-US affiliate of MLPF&S and is not registered/qualified as a research analyst under\nthe FINRA rules.\nRefer to \"Other Important Disclosures\" for information on certain BofA Merrill Lynch entities that take\nresponsibility for this report in particular jurisdictions.\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

However, the spill-over\ninto US Treasuries was relatively muted (Chart 7), and coupled with a small and fleeting\ndrawdown in US equities, risk parity portfolio volatility failed to rise materially (Chart 8).\nConsequently, risk parity funds were likely forced to unwind little to none of their\nleverage last week and remain near max leverage levels (Chart 9).\nFor this very reason, the latent risk in this corner of the quant fund space remains worth\nmonitoring. Furthermore, as we noted post-Brexit, fixed income allocations within risk\nparity funds are historically elevated today. And with federal-funds futures markets\nimplying a ~25% chance of a Sep rate hike and less than a 50% probability of a Dec\nhike, bond markets may be surprised by a 2016 Fed hike.\nChart 7: Last week’s sharp sell-off in JGBs did\nnot spill-over into US Treasuries\n104\n103\n102\n101\n100\n99\nJan-16 Apr-16 Jul-16\n10y JGB futures total return\n108\n106\n104\n102\n100\n98\n10y UST futures total return (right)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

Risk parity allocations are\ndetermined and rebalanced monthly using prior 12-month\nrealized volatility and correlations.\nMonitoring relative equity/bond moves for potential risk parity deleveraging\nIt is intuitive to think that rising volatility corresponds to an increase in model-driven\nselling pressure from risk parity strategies. However, what’s less appreciated in our\nview is the impact on risk parity allocations as a result of the relative dynamics\nbetween component volatilities and correlation. For example, through the close on the\nMonday post-Brexit (27-Jun-16), S&P 500 volatility rose from 9.6% two days prior to\n17.9% (increase of 1.9x) while 10-Year US Treasury Futures return volatility rose 4.3%\nto 6.6% (increase of 1.5x). Despite these outsized vol moves, in a recent report we\nshowed that owing to the diversification (increasingly negative correlation) between\nequities and bonds, unlevered risk parity portfolio volatility remained stable and hence,\ntarget vol overlays were less likely to be subject to model-driven selling.\nGiven low levels of realized volatility across asset classes, it’s also intuitive to expect\ncontinued elevated levels of leverage in risk parity products. To the extent that the\nleverage is via vol control overlays, there are reasonable concerns on the potential\nmarket impact should these model-driven investments be forced to simultaneously\ndeleverage. To that end, we provide a simple scenario tool (Chart 10) to help investors\nassess what relative moves in the S&P 500 and 10-year US Treasury futures could\ncatalyze significant deleveraging by rules-based, vol-controlled risk parity funds.\n4 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016\nImportantly, this scenario tool is a function of (1) current unlevered risk parity volatility,\n(2) current risk parity component weights, and (3) the maximum leverage of the target\nvolatility overlay. For simplicity, we used only a two asset risk parity portfolio of equity\nand fixed income applied to the S&P 500 and 10-Year US Treasury Futures.\nChart 10: Current theoretical deleveraging amounts (of unlevered notional) for an equity/fixed\nincome risk parity portfolio with an 8% target volatility overlay and 2x max leverage cap\nAssumes a trailing unlevered volatility of 3.1%, unlevered equity and fixed income weights of 22% and 78% respectively,\nand leverage at a maximum of 2.0 times\n5%\nDaily 10-year USD Treasury Futures Total Return\n4%\n3%\n2%\n1%\n0%\n-1%\n-2%\n-3%\n-4%\nBrexit\nAug-15 Risk Flare\nTaper Tantrum\n-5%\n-5% -4% -3% -2% -1% 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5%\nDaily S&P 500 Total Return\n> 50% Delever 50% to 25% Delever 25% to 0% Delever No Delever\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. Data as of 5-Aug-16. Equity and fixed income components within the theoretical risk parity\ninvestment are represented by S&P 500 total return and 10-Year US Treasury Futures total return. Risk parity allocations are determined\nmonthly and rebalanced using prior 12-month realized volatility. Unlevered portfolio volatility for determining target volatility leverage\nmeasured using EWMA with lambda equal to 0.94.\nFor example, last Friday 10-Year US Treasury futures declined about 60bps. Had the\nS&P 500 declined 2.0%, we would have expected about 25% of the unlevered notional\nof a model 8% vol-targeted, 2.0x max leverage risk parity portfolio to deleverage. The\nS&P 500 was in fact up 86bps on a total return basis which according to the tool falls in\nthe region of no deleveraging.\nAlso, to put recent events in perspective, we plotted on the scenario tool the respective\nmoves in the S&P 500 and 10-Year US Treasury futures during the Taper Tantrum (19-\nJun-2013), the Aug-15 risk flare (24-Aug-15), and post-Brexit (24-Jun-2016). Note, for\nan accurate assessment through those events, we would also need to reconfigure the\nscenario tool for the respective unlevered risk parity volatility and risk parity component\nweights on those dates. However, with current measures for both, the tool does\nestimate current deleveraging flows should we see similar equity and bond moves today.\nInterestingly, equity/bond moves through the Aug-15 risk flare would not cause a\ndeleveraging today. The reason is bonds have increased in allocation since last August\n(78% vs. 66%), and hence the portfolio is more resilient towards equity market declines\n(but consequently also more sensitive to fixed income declines).\nThe scenario tool also underscores impact on risk parity leverage as a result of the\nrelative dynamics between component volatility and correlation. For example, the first\nand third quadrants (upper right and lower left sections) are dominated by scenarios of\ngreater than 50% deleveraging. On the other hand, the second and fourth quadrants\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016 5\nhave episodes of more benign model-driven deleveraging. In each quadrant exists\nexamples of simultaneously increasing equity and bond volatility (that is, high absolute\nequity and bond daily returns). However, in the first and third quadrant, equity and bond\nmoves are in the same direction, which would likely be an example of increasing\ncorrelation. On the other hand, in the second and fourth quadrant equity and bond\nmoves are in opposite directions and hence correlation is subject to a decrease. The\nmain takeaway here is the most risk of model driven deleveraging from vol controlled\nrisk parity funds comes when both volatility and correlation of the underlying\ncomponents rise together.\n6 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016\nWeek in review & notable trends (US)\nUS equities at new all-time highs on upbeat employment report\nBoth the S&P500 and NASDAQ finished the week higher marking fresh all-time highs as\nthe July nonfarm payrolls and average hourly earnings came in better-than-expected.

More importantly, the central bank announced it will conduct a comprehensive\nassessment of its policy at its Sep meeting. By giving guidance for the next meeting,\nthe BoJ has inevitably focused market attention on possible changes to the monetary\npolicy framework. Significant monetary easing, including helicopter money, cannot be\nruled out, but the more likely scenario is that the BoJ makes current monetary policy,\nwhich is fixed on achieving 2% inflation target in a short period of time, more 'flexible'.\nMarket expectation for the Sep BOJ in terms of fwd vol is the near its lows YTD\nWith NKY Sep ATM vol at 17.8% and Oct ATM at 20%, the NKY Sep-Oct ATM forward\nvol is at 21.8%, which is at the low end of the trading range going into BOJ events this\nyear (Chart 30). We think there is value in owning forward vol via calendar options.\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016 15\nA further squeeze in US and Japanese yields is most positive Japan in Asia\nThe strong US NFP print and the large Japan fiscal plan catalysed a global selloff in\nbonds.

Following the monetary policy\nchanges announced during the BoJ, the Abe Cabinet approved a fiscal stimulus package\ntotalling ¥28.1tn last week. However, the Nikkei fell 190bps and the yen advanced\nanother 32bps over the week. The Korean government submitted a KRW28tn fiscal\npackage proposal to the Congress, which our economists believe should sustain growth\nnear term; the KOSPI2 was little changed (adding 35bps). The RBA cut rates by 25bps\nas our economists expected, but Australian stocks declined with the ASX 200 dropping\n117bps.

The most severe risks associated with general options\ntrading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can\noccur in a short period.\nInvestor suitability\nThe use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are\nconsidered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are\nencouraged to become familiar with the \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized\nOptions\" (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult\nwith a FINRA Registered Options Principal. For detailed information regarding the risks\ninvolved with investing in listed options:\nhttp://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp\n24 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016\nDisclosures\nImportant Disclosures\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s).
