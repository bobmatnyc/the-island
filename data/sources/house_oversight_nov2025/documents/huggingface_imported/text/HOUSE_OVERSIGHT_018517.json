  "text": "We felt like our sexuality wasn't for us. Or at least, that's how I felt.\n\nEven though on the surface it looked like I was totally in charge of my sexual decisions,\nthere were social pressures and expectations that made me feel overwhelmed and\nconfused. Not always, and not all the time! But enough that there were plenty of times\nthat I just felt like all I wanted to do was stop and be done with it... \"take my body back\"\nfrom a world that seemed intent on constantly telling me how I must look, how I must\ndress, how I must have sex.\n\nI've written about how much easier it was for me to learn how I ought to look and\n\"perform\" while having sex, than it was for me to learn what I actually wanted from sex.\nThat, I think, is where the chastity urge came from for me. That, and the way I kept\nfinding myself making out with guys who I had zero interest in because it was \"too\nawkward to say no.\" Or the way I didn't feel like I could decide not to have sex with my\nboyfriends; not because I didn't think my boyfriend would listen if I said no, but because\nhis potentially hurt feelings seemed so much more important than my bodily preferences.\n\nSo many things about the way I was having sex seemed to have nothing to do with me.\nAnd if sex had nothing to do with me... then why was I doing it? I guess I wanted to\nreassure myself that I could take control of at least one thing: saying no.\n\nEventually, I got a better handle on my sexual preferences and began to learn how to talk\nabout them. It was a long process, and my sexual journey is far from over (yay!). There\nwere people who showed me what it meant to have a low-pressure sexual relationship;\nthere were people who made it easy for me to talk about sex; and there were other people\nwho made it easy for me to turn them down, sexually, which was just as important.\n\nBut one interesting thing during the beginning of my learning process... especially given\nthat I now really emphasize and encourage talking directly about sex... was that I felt like\na couple of my boyfriends really, really didn't want to talk about sex. And while\nsometimes this was clearly terrible and toxic, sometimes it felt good. It felt safe. I wanted\nto be sexual, but I also felt so much pressure to be sexual that it sometimes felt like a\nhuge relief to just... \"not worry about it.”\n\nIn retrospect, though, I think that the \"safety\" I felt when I didn't talk about sex with\ncertain partners was a mirage. It was a false safety, sustained by a carefully crafted\nmutual fiction of the relationship. When we ended up talking about sex later, \"giving up\nthat safety” just made the conversation unnecessarily scary and weird. And the\nindependent illusions we each had about our sexual relationship flourished and grew\nstrong within our silence. Those illusions were so much harder to release after months of\nself-reinforcement than they would have been if we'd dragged them into the light from\nthe beginning!\n\nOccasionally, I wonder how it would have felt if I'd taken that deliberate year of chastity.\nI wonder which of my early experiences would have changed; I wonder whether a year of\nchastity would have made me feel more comfortable with my sexuality sooner. I'm very\nhappy with how I feel sexually now. I sometimes feel confused or overwhelmed, but I\nthink I'm okay at handling that and even talking about it. Yet I do wonder how it would\nhave felt to draw such a strong boundary; to say such a strong \"No\" to the world and its\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018517",
