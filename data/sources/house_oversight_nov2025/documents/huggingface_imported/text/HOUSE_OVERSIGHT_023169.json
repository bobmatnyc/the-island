On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly\nvoted Resolution 181, also known as the Partition Plan. It called for the creation of two\nstates—one Palestinian and one Jewish.\n\nOther key UN Resolutions include General Assembly Resolution 194 (1948), which\ncalls for the return of Palestinian refugees; General Assembly Resolution 303 (1949),\nwhich designates Jerusalem to be placed under UN jurisdiction; and, most famously,\nSecurity Council Resolution 242 (1967), which calls on Israel to withdraw from all\nterritory seized during the Six Day War of 1967.\n\nParadoxically, some of the Resolutions are seen by both parties as supporting their\nside of the argument. For example, in Resolution 242 the interpretation of the clause\ncalling for “withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent\nconflict” has been controversially ambiguous, and the object of widely different inter-\npretations. The key argument relates to whether the clause requires Israel to withdraw\nfrom all territory occupied in the 1967 war, or only from some parts of the territory\ncaptured. While many Resolutions have had hardly any effect, they nevertheless\ncontinue to be used as points of reference in the different attempts to resolve the\nconflict.\n\nON PART IV: REGIONAL DOCUMENTS\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian issue cannot be seen in isolation: it affects and has been affected.\nby broader regional dynamics and conflicts for a century. After years of colonial\ncompetition, France and the United Kingdom drew lines in the sand through the\nSykes-Picot Agreement of 1916. This agreement divided the region into spheres of\ninfluence, and eventually led to the creation of new countries. In the subsequent thirty\nyears, several programmatic initiatives were taken in the context of multiple anti-\ncolonial campaigns for national self-determination and political sovereignty, including\nthe quest of the Jewish people for a national homeland.\n\nThe 1948 war between Arab countries and the newly founded State of Israel resulted\nin the latter significantly expanding its territory beyond that allotted to it by the UN\nPartition Plan. This marked the beginning of more than half a century of Israeli-Arab\ntensions and conflicts. Gradually the focus moved from the legitimacy of the state of\nIsrael to the country’s territorial boundaries. This coincided with broadening support,\nnot only internationally but also in Israel, for the establishment of a Palestinian state\nliving peacefully, side by side, with the state of Israel, within mutually secured borders.\n\nObtaining the regional buy-in to peace with Israel began with the different armistice\nagreements signed in the wake of the 1948 war. While these agreements ended the war,\nthe fighting continued to flare up as the armistice lines established were not inter-\nnationally recognized borders.\n\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict came to a new head with the Six Day War in June 1967,\nwhen Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West\nBank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. In the\naftermath, Arab nations unified their position against Israel with the Arab League\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023169",
