As of February 28, 2006,\nthe company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $411 million and $33 million, respectively. The\ncompany has been owned by JP Morgan Capital since 1998.\n\n@ Nobe! Learning Communities (Public)\n\nNobel is a for-profit provider of private pay education and services for education entities for the preschool\nthrough 12th grade market. The company’s programs are offered through a network of general education\npreschools, elementary and middle schools, programs for learning challenged students and special\npurpose high schools. Nobel operates 150 schools in 13 states across the U.S. As of December 31,\n2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $166 million and $15 million, respectively.\nAffiliates of the Principals are currenily significant shareholders of the company.\n\n8.3.4 Government's Role in Early Childhood Education\n\nApproximately 83% of the estimated 554 billion spent on ECE is generated by private and independent\nnon-profit services. The government provides the remaining 17% of services through Head Start and\npublic schools. The government pays for public school and Head Start programs, but also subsidizes\npayments of low-income families to providers of their choice through the Child Care Development Block\nGrant and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which are blended with state dollars. About 25% of\nfor-profit early childhood care revenue comes from these subsidy programs.\n\nThe government is, at both the federal and state level, actively involved in expanding the availability of\nearly childhood care services. Federal support is delivered at the state level through government-\noperated educational and financial assistance programs. Early childhood care services offered directly by\nstates include training, licensing and regulation for early childhood care providers and resource and\nreferral systems for parents seeking ECE.\n\nThe increasing importance of education is further demonstrated by the “No Child Left Behind Act of\n2001,\" signed into law in January 2002. This Act is the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and\nSecondary Education Act, or ESEA, since ESEA was enacted in 1965. To support this commitment,\nPresident Bush requested a $54.4 billion budget for the Department of Education for fiscal 2007, a 28.9%\nincrease from the 2001 budget of $42.2 billion.\n\nCertain tax incentives exist for early childhood care programs. Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code\nprovides federal Income tax credits ranging from 20% to 35% of certain early childhood care expenses for\nqualified individuals.\n\n8.4, The U.S, K-12 Education Market\n\nA fundamental change has occurred in the K-12 sector in recent years, as the desire to improve school\nquality has overtaken demographics as a key growth driver. Companies providing supplemental\neducational services (e.g., KLC) and several school alternatives, such as charter and contract schools\n(e.g., k12), are expected to be instrumental in improving K-12 student performance.\n\nThe K-12 education market in the U.S. is comprised of over 15,000 school districts including mere than\n90,000 K-12 public schools, approximately 3.5 million teachers, and about 54 million students according\nto the National Center for Education Statistics. Total K-12 expenditures, federal, state and local, are\napproximately $500 billion.\n\nDespite the growth in spending on public education over the last decade, student achievement has shown\nlittie progress. According to the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 32% of eighth-\ngraders performed below the Basic level in mathematics, and only 29% performed at or above the\nProficient level. One-third of American fourth graders are functionally illiterate. KUE believes the\nfollowing factors will present significant market opportunities in the coming years for for-profit K-12\n\n67\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024500",
