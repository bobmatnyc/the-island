  "text": "line. In a stroke of good fortune, the brigade commander was Dovik Tamari,\nAvraham Arnan’s first successor as commander of the sayeret. While we waited\nour forward deployment, due in September, he included me in his discussions\nwith his senior officers on tactics and planning. This inevitably included the\ncore of our existing strategy: a line of fixed fortifications which we had built on\nour side of the canal after the war. They were known as the Bar-Lev Line,\nbecause the chief of staff ultimately had to sign off on them. But the main\nimpetus had come from Avraham Adan. A former Palmachnik, known as Bren,\nhe was the overall head of the armored corps.\n\nThere were strong critics of the Bar-Lev line, but few more vocal than Arik\nSharon. The very qualities that had made him the perfect choice to lead Unit\n101 and its successor commando units — a natural instinct to favor bold,\npreemptive attacks, allied with an absolute confidence in his own judgment and\nlittle time for those who challenged it — had stalled his rise up the military\nladder for a few years. But now he was head of Israel’s southern command. He\nwas convinced that in the event of another full-scale war with Egypt, the Bar-\nLev line would be worse than useless. We’d find ourselves forced to defend a\nstring of fortifications that could serve no real purpose in repelling a concerted\nEgyptian attempt to retake the Sinai. Arik’s preferred strategy was to let the\nEgyptian troops cross the canal and then confront them on terms where Israeli\nforces had a proven advantage: a mobile battle in the open desert.\n\nWhen the debate came up in our brigade strategy discussions, I said I\nbelieved Arik was right. From our recent sayeret missions, I said there was no\nway the Bar-Lev fortifications could protect us. I knew how easy it had been for\nus to operate unseen between Egyptian positions across the canal, and they were\nonly a few hundred yards apart. On some parts of the Bar-Lev line, there were\nSix or seven miles between outposts. A whole Egyptian brigade could pass\nthrough.\n\nVery few in the kirya, however, seemed ready to recalibrate our strategy\nagainst the Egyptians. Only later, when the damage had already been done,\nwould it become clear that the navy was alone in acting on lessons learned from\nthe fighting since the 1967 war. Having lost its largest warship to a more mobile\nEgyptian missile boat at the outset of the War of Attrition, it began focusing on\ndeploying mobile missile boats of its own. But the air force was showing no\nsign of dealing with the implications of the Egyptians’ increased anti-aircraft\ncapability — even though we’d begun losing planes and pilots to the new\nsurface-to-air missile batteries Nasser had received from the Soviets.
