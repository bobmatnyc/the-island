  "text": "stinger into the brain that causes intense auto-grooming followed by three weeks of\nlethargy. During this down time, the cockroach turns into a living meal for the wasp’s\nlarvae.\n\n*A Brazilian parasitoid wasp of the family Braconidae, lays its eggs inside a\nparticular species of caterpillar, and once the larvae are fully developed, they hatch out of\nthe caterpillar. Though it is strange enough for caterpillars to function like incubators,\nthese innocent larvae were anything but innocent while developing inside the caterpillar.\nOnce the larvae hatch, they are treated to an unprecedented level of care from the\ncaterpillar who, Gandhi-like, foregoes all eating and moving to protect its adopted young,\nincluding violent head-swings against any intruder. The wasp has effectively brain-\nwashed the caterpillar, hijacking its evolved instincts to care for its own young.\n\n*A solitary wasp in the genus Sce/iphron selectively feeds on the dangerous and\nmuch larger black widow spider, using two tricks: it secretes a substance that is like\nTeflon, allowing it to move into a spider’s web without getting stuck; next, it flails\naround in the web to attract the spider, and once the spider is positioned above in kill\nmode, the wasp launches its stinger, piercing the spider right through the brain. End of\n\nblack widow. If the wasp makes the slightest mistake, end of wasp.\n\nThe capacity that has evolved in these wasps is myopically focused on one problem, and one problem\nalone. Despite the mind control and deception that is part of their evolved competence, they don’t deploy\nthese skills in any other context. This highly adaptive and monogamous pattern of thinking runs\nthroughout the animal kingdom and across different contexts, including male cleaner fish that attack\nfemale cleaner fish who violate the rules of mucus-eating from their clients, but do not deploy such\ndraconian measures in other situations; birds that feign injury to deter predators from their nest, but\ndeceive in no other context; cheetah mothers who demonstrate to their cubs how to bring down prey, but\nnever provide pedagogical instructions in other relevant domains of development; and monkeys that\nunderstand how to use tools generously provided by humans but never create any of their own.\n\nLike other animals, we too are equipped with adaptive capacities that evolved to solve particular\nproblems. Unlike other animals, however, these same adaptive specializations are readily deployed to\nsolve novel problems, often by combining capacities. Like wasps, we deceive, manipulate and parasitize\nothers, often cruelly. But unlike wasps, we don’t use these abilities with one type of victim in one context.\nAs long as the opportunity for personal gain is high relative to the potential cost, we are more than willing\nto deceive, manipulate, and parasitize lovers, competitors and family members. When we attack rule\n\nviolators, not only do we do so in the context of cheaters who eat but don’t pay, but also deadbeat dads\n\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 28\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012774",
