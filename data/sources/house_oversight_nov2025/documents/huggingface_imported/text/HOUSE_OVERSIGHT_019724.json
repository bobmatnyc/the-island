Its hierarchy is also obscure.\nFew traces have been uncovered of any conventional espionage net-\nworks in the United States, and no major Chinese spy has ever been\narrested. Part of the reason that Chinese espionage has proved so elu-\nsive to the eyes of Western counterintelligence is that, unlike Russia,\nit did not ordinarily rely on intelligence officers in its embassies to\nrecruit penetration agents to steal secrets. It did not even have an\nembassy in the United States during most of the Cold War. Instead,\nits services specialize in mosaics of intelligence assembled from a\nwide variety of sources, including nonclassified documents, return-\ning graduate students, scientific conferences, exchanges with allies,\nand a vast operation of hacking into computers, or cyber espionage.\n\nSuch espionage is indeed a vast enterprise in China. Graduating\nover 150,000 computer science engineers in the 1990s, it had no\nshortage of personnel. It had also developed the cyber tool kit to gain\naccess to the computer networks of U.S. government contractors and\nconsultants in the private sector and government agencies, planting\n“sleeper” bugs in networked computers. Like human sleeper agents,\n\n© these hidden programs can be activated when needed for operational ©\npurposes. Chinese controllers can often retrieve e-mails and docu-\nments and can turn on the cameras and microphones of personal\ncomputers, tablets, and smart phones.\n\nBy 2007, Paul Strassmann, a top U.S. defense expert on cyber\nespionage, reported that China had inserted “zombie” programs in\nsome 700,000 computers in the United States, which could be used to\nmount cyber attacks to retrieve e-mails from other computers. The\nChinese service also reportedly penetrated companies that provide\nInternet services, including Google, Yahoo!, Symantec, and Adobe,\nwhich allowed it to track e-mails and enclosures of individuals. With\nsuch an invisible army of zombie computers, it is not entirely sur-\nprising that China finds little need to employ human sleeper agents.\n\nChinese cyber specialists used this capability to hack into the\ncomputers of outside contractors, including Booz Allen and other\ncompanies that supplied technologists to the NSA. It also had nota-\nble successes in obtaining the dossiers of U.S. employees and inde-\npendent contractors at the NSA, the CIA, and other intelligence\nservices. Its intrusions, as previously noted, into computer networks\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 236 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019724",
