  "text": "Sources tell Page Six that Epstein's high-powered lawyers - including Alan\nDershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black and Kenneth Starr - have been\nnegotiating a deal with federal prosecutors who are probing, among other\nthings, whether the gray-haired money manager paid West Palm Beach girls\nfor sex or transported them across state lines. Epstein is currently charged by\nthe State of Florida with soliciting young prostitutes for sex - but federal\ncharges would be far more serious.\n\nThe Palm Beach Post reported yesterday that Epstein is very close to a deal\nwith the feds that would send him to jail for 1% to 2 years. Sources tell us that\nwhile a deal has not yet solidified, what's under discussion is a guilty plea to\nat least one charge in exchange for a sentence of 15 months in a Florida state\nprison, followed by 15 months of home confinement. That would be a fraction\nof the time he would have to serve if he were to be convicted by a jury.\n\nEpstein's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said his client would have no\ncomment. Dershowitz also declined to comment late yesterday.\n\nPalm Beach police records show that on March 15, 2005, a 14-year-old girl\nalleged she had visited Epstein's estate, where she partially stripped and\n\ngave him a massage during which he \"pulled out a purple vibrator\" and used it\non her in exchange for $300. A further probe uncovered five young women\nwho said Epstein had masturbated and touched their genitals during\n\nmassages, the records state. A woman named Haley Robson - who\n\ndescribed herself as \"like a Heidi Fleiss\" - later admitted bringing six girls\nbetween the ages of 14 and 16 to Epstein's house, according to cops.\n\nDespite the allegations, Epstein was only nailed on a single charge of\nsoliciting a hooker - but it sparked a federal probe. Epstein's lawyers and\nfriends have insisted he was the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach\nPolice Chief Michael Reiter, whom they described as a \"born-again nutcase.”\n\nPalm Beach Post - 08/14/ 2006\n\nPolice chief's reputation helps discredit attacks\nBy Larry Keller\nPalm Beach Post - Monday, August 14, 2006\n\nIn the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are\naccused of wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter.\n\nEpstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution\nsolely because of Reiter's \"craziness,\" one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department\ndisseminated \"a distorted view of the case\" and behaved in a \"childish\" manner when the\ngrand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another Epstein lawyer\ncomplained.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021781",
