  "text": "A NOTE ON THE TYPE\n\nThe text of this book was set in a typeface called Aldus, designed by\nthe celebrated typographer Hermann Zapf in 1952-53. Based on\nthe classical proportion of the popular Palatino type family, Aldus\nwas originally adapted for Linotype composition as a slightly\nlighter version that would read better in smaller sizes.\nHermann Zapf was born in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1918. He\nhas created many other well known typefaces including Comenius,\n© Hunt Roman, Marconi, Melior, Michelangelo, Optima, Saphir, Sis- ®\ntina, Zapf Book and Zapf Chancery.\n\nComposed by North Market Street Graphics, Lancaster, Pennsylvania\nPrinted and bound by Berryville Graphics, Berryville, Virginia\n\nDesigned by Maggie Hinders\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 355 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019843",
