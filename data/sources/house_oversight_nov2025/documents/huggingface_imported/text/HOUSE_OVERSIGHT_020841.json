  "text": "With these trends, USA Inc. will not be immune to the sudden crises that have afflicted others\nwith similar unfunded liabilities, leverage, and productivity trends. The sovereign credit issues in\nEurope suggest what might lie ahead for USA Inc. shareholders — and our children. In effect,\nUSA Inc. is maxing out its credit card. It has fallen into a pattern of spending more than it earns\nand is issuing debt at nearly every turn. Common principles for overcoming this kind of burden\ninclude the following:\n\n1) Acknowledge the problem — some 80% of Americans believe ‘dealing with our growing\nbudget deficit and national debt’ is a national priority, according to a Peter G. Peterson\nFoundation survey in 11/09;\n\n2) Examine past errors — People need clear descriptions and analysis to understand how the\nUS arrived at its current financial condition — a ‘turnaround CEO’ would certainly initiate a\n‘no holds barred’ analysis of the purpose, success and operating efficiency of all of USA\nInc.’s spending;\n\n3) | Make amends for past errors — Most Americans today at least acknowledge the problems\nat personal levels and say they rarely or never spend more than what they can afford (63%\naccording to a 2007 Pew Research study). The average American knows the importance\nof managing a budget. Perhaps more would be willing to sacrifice for the greater good with\nan understandable plan to serve the country’s long-term best interests;\n\n4) Develop a new code of behavior — Policymakers, businesses (including investment firms),\nand citizens need to share responsibility for past failures and develop a plan for future\nsuccesses.\n\nPast generations of Americans have responded to major challenges with collective\nsacrifice and hard work. Will ours also rise to the occasion?\n\nCB www.kpcb.com USA Inc. xviii\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020841",
