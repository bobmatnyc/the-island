While we expect the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) to gradually shift\nto a more neutral stance that is less punitive to\nbank profitability and acknowledges the uptrend\nin headline inflation, this shift does not imply the\nremoval of accommodation. Indeed, the ECB has\nalready announced an extension of quantitative\neasing through December 2017. Meanwhile, the\nEuropean Commission has endorsed a moderate\nfiscal easing of 0.5% of GDP for the Eurozone.\nGiven that fiscal policy is typically loosened ahead\nof major elections, this guidance could soon be\nembraced in France and Germany.\n\nOf equal importance, both consumption and\nbusiness investment are well positioned as we enter\n2017. On the former, continued improvement in\nthe labor market and ongoing GDP growth should\n\nOngoing uncertainty regarding Brexit,\n\nthe banking sector and upcoming\nelections remains a potential\ndownside risk.\n\nencourage consumers to spend a bit from their\nprecautionary savings, particularly given today’s\nrelatively high savings rate. At the same time, the\nfundamental justifications for increased business\nspending, such as higher demand and easy credit\nconditions, stand at their best levels in years (see\nExhibit 42). Perhaps not surprisingly, a late 2016\nsurvey of manufacturing firms revealed their\ninvestment intentions stood at all-time highs.!%\n\nOf course, ongoing uncertainty regarding\nBrexit, the banking sector and upcoming elections\nremains a potential downside risk, particularly\nfor an investment recovery. As a result, we\nacknowledge a greater-than-normal range of\npotential outcomes, both positive and negative. For\nexample, the victory of the far right in the French\npresidential election could unleash fears about\nFrance exiting the European Union and endanger\nthe survival of the euro, while the new government\nin Italy could speed up the long-overdue\nresolution of the banking sector’s\nproblems and change the electoral law to\nreduce political uncertainties.\n\nFor now, our base case assumes\nthat Italy will avoid a populist party in\ngovernment and that a centrist candidate\nwill win the French presidential election.\nThus, we expect the Eurozone to again\nweather the storm in 2017.\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 43\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014576",
