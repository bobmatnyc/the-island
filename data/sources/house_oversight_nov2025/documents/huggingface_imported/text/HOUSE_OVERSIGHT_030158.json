  "text": "America’s secret contacts with the Taliban have made progress partly\nbecause President Hamid Karzai wants them to succeed and, perhaps\nmore important, because India, Pakistan, Russia and China are also\nsupporting the outreach process — with silent acquiescence from\nIran, too. This regional framework is the real exit ramp that will allow\nwithdrawal of U.S. troops.\n\nLet’s think about how this diplomatic model might apply to Libya\nand Syria. In both cases, the insurgents are seen in the West as the\n“sood guys,” battling corrupt, autocratic leaders.
