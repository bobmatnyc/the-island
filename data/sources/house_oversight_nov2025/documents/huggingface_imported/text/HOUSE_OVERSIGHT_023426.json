There may\nbe someone as good in New York, but i'11 never tell you and you really have a heck of a seminar table\nthere . when do we do whitman's “Song of Myself\" 1-15 who else is reading with us? I'm ready .\n\nA few other follow ups :\n\nDavid and Brigid point out that reality tv doesn't cost anything because it is, as it sounds, very low\n\nbudget . No writing , no special expertise or knowledge or research , no archival footage , no copyright\nclearance , no actors , no travel beyond the one location , certainly no clinton or woody allen or\njustice elena kagan or david brooks or Lena Dunham or even Professor New. That said , I think If were\n\nhiring the crew id do it for less -- probably 1, 250,000 all in . But I haven't won 10 Emmys and David\nhas . That has value too. As does Wgbh . But I'll be more prepared for the next conversation and want to\nbe much more prepared for templeton, so thank you .\n\nI really liked Michael. I would like to send him some stuff , but in googling him I noticed that we have\nthe same birthday! May I have his email?\n\nYou are in! Yeay! Lets see what this may mean? I'll improve my numbers and you'll improve your deep\nreading ?\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023426",
