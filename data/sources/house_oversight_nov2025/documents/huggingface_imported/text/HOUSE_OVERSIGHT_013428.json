A.1\n\nLENGTH: 561 words\n\nHEADLINE: EPSTEIN PLEA DEAL TO REMAIN SEALED FOR NOW\nBYLINE: DAVID ROGERS, DAVID ROGERS, Daily News Staff Writer\n\nBODY:\n\nThe plea deal that part-time Palm Beacher Jeffrey Epstein agreed to several months ago to avoid federal charges\nwill remain sealed for the time being.\n\nLawyers for The Palm Beach Post and a woman who claimed Epstein solicited and procured her for sex at his El\nBrillo Way home while she was underage asked Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath Wednesday morning\nto unseal the plea documents immediately.\n\nInstead, Colbath decided to leave the documents sealed and give Jack Goldberger, the attorney representing Ep-\nstein, until 1 p.m. Friday to file papers showing why the records should remain out of public view.\n\nColbath agreed to let the Post and \"E.W.\" have standing in the case and set a hearing on whether the documents\nshould be unsealed for 1:30 p.m. June 25.\n\nEpstein agreed in September 2007 to plead to state charges to avoid federal prosecution, Goldberger told County\nJudge Deborah Pucillo at Epstein's plea conference last year.\n\nThe sealing of the records in question was said to be a \"significant inducement\" for Epstein, who is serving 18\nmonths in the Palm Beach County Stockade -- with daytime release -- and is facing several civil lawsuits in state and\nfederal courts by more than a dozen alleged victims.\n\nColbath said, \"I don't see where any of the proper procedures to seal the documents were ever followed ...\" but that\nhe would give Epstein's legal team the ability to \"jump through the hoops to seal the documents if they are entitled in\nfact to be sealed.”\n\nThe sealing of court documents in Florida is unusual and lawyers typically have to prove a significant reason for it,\nsuch as protecting trade secrets or a compelling government interest.\n\nGoldberger said after the hearing there is no rush to unseal the plea deal.\n\n\"I think the records clearly need to be sealed and continue to be sealed but I think the ruling by Judge Colbath was a\nvery well- reasoned practical decision,\" Goldberger said. \"He is not getting special treatment.\"\n\nBrad Edwards, of the law firm of Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler of Fort Lauderdale, said the plea deal should be a\npublic record. His firm represents the woman, now 20, who was identified only as E.W.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013428",
