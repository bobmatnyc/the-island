  "text": "Sentiment Ranking Update\n\nWe are updating our sentiment ranking index on 25 stocks in our Internet coverage\nuniverse (as of 4/4/17). We have aggregated six different indicators we think are\nrelevant to gauge sentiment and have generated an overall “sentiment” score for each\ncompany. This sentiment analysis is intended to be informative and should not be used\nto form an investment opinion; for example our model does not factor in valuation or\nmanagement quality. Of our company coverage universe, we have excluded four game\npublisher companies as well as two recent IPO’s from this analysis as data may not be\ncomparable.\n\nTable 6: 1Q16 change in sentiment ranking\n\nTicker Rank Pre dQ A Score PredQ A\n\n1 43 4 +4\n-1 4 +2\n\n3 -1 8 -1\n4 +5 8 +4\n5 2 9 “1\nGOOGL 6 NA 9 +1\n7 1 9 +2\n8 +9 11 43\n9 +5 12 +2\n10 +5 12 +2\n11 4 13 -2\n12 +4 13 1\n13 +5 14 1\n14 9 14 5\n15 +6 14 43\n16 +8 14 +5\n17 7 16 4\n18 5 16 3\n19 NA 16 NA\n20 9 16 4\n21 +1 17 +1\n22 -10 17 4\n23 +2 19 1\n24 -1 20 -2\n25 5 21 5\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\n\nInvestor sentiment categories\n\nWe assembled data that measures investor sentiment across six categories. These\nmetrics include latest short interest (as a % of float), change in short interest as a % of\nfloat over the last 90 days, current stock performance over the last 90 days, current\naverage sell side ratings, forward year EPS estimate revisions over last 90 days, and\nexpected FY17 revenue growth. While there are no perfect indicators of average\ninvestor sentiment, we believe these metrics provide a helpful framework of investor\nsentiment in our sector. In our analysis, Facebook, WIX, and LendingTree had the highest\nsentiment in 1Q, while Fitbit, Trip and Twitter had the lowest sentiment. Care.com had\nthe most improved ranking, moving up 9 points to 8\", while Quotient had the biggest\ndecline moving down 10 spots in our ranking to 22™.\n\nMethodology\n\nOur methodology consisted of: 1) gathering financial data across six categories that we\nbelieve are relevant to measuring investor sentiment, 2) ranking companies on each\nattribute using a scale of 1 to 29, with 1 highest and 29 the lowest, and 3) ranking the\ncompanies based on the avg. score of the six metrics.\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n8 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014894",
