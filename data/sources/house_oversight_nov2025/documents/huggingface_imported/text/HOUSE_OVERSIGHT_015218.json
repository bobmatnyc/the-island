  "text": "swinging is the answer. To them, cheating is not an issue, unfaithfulness is\nobsolescent, and adultery is merely a concept that deprived former Air\nForce Lieutenant Kelly Flinn of her opportunity to drop a nuclear bomb.\n\nThe Lifestyles Convention provides a nurturing environment for\nthese couples the same way a convention of crossword-puzzle enthusiasts\nor barbed-wire collectors would provide for those folks. Yet, in the case of\nswingers, one is left with a puzzle. Is impersonal intimacy an oxymoron? |\nask that question of psychologist Stella Resnick, sex therapist and author\nof 7he Pleasure Zone. Her reply:\n\n“We can’ t put a value judgment on this. These are all consenting\nadults. It doesn’ t really matter that it’ s rather impersonal because they\nare in long-term relationships, so they’ re getting their intimacy needs\nmet, but not necessarily their needs for excitement in sex, and this is\ncertainly a way to do it. Often they are sexually identified in the sense that\nthey’ re sexual people, they have strong desires, they’ re not necessarily\ninto politics or other causes, but this is a good cause—being in the body,\nbeing healthy—and it’ s a way of relaxing and enjoying their bodies.\nWhatever turns you on, as long as you’ re not doing any damage to\n\nanybody else and you’ re taking care of yourself, fine, enjoy.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015218",
