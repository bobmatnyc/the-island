  "text": "14\n\nto stand tall for American greatness if only to anaesthetize them\nagainst day-to-day hardship.\n\nRepublican wannabes sense all this. To judge by the early stages of\nthe 2012 campaign, they think foreign policy might matter after all.\nThey’re trying to cast Barack Obama as a president who has sold\nAmerica short, an impostor who has ditched the mystical belief in the\nunique calling of the United States that is American exceptionalism.\nSo Mitt Romney says Obama takes his values not from the small\ntowns of America but from “the capitals of Europe.” Obama treats\nIsrael the way European countries do — with “suspicion” and\n“distrust.” He’s offering “European answers to American problems.”\nHe’s projecting a weak United States: “We’re following the French\ninto Libya.” The president is a naive idealist undermined by his\n“questioning as to whether America is an exceptional nation.”\n\nFor Europe, in the above characterization, read land of feckless\nsocialists on welfare bent on universal health care.\n\nNot to be outdone, Newt Gingrich has decrypted in Obama a\n“Kenyan, anti-colonial” worldview.\n\nGingrich wants a “foreign policy that is clear about the evil that we\nface” — that would be Shariah law among other things — and rooted\nin this universalist message: “America is still the last, best hope of\nmankind on Earth.” As for Sarah Palin, she attributes most of\nObama’s problems to what she’s called his “lack of faith in American\nexceptionalism.” I have several reactions to this that all fit under the\nrubric: baloney! First, we’re not in 1990 any longer: America remains\ndominant but cannot resolve major problems alone and will in the\nnext decade, by some estimates, see China overtake it as the world’s\nlargest economy. Second, it’s precisely Republican factionalism in\nWashington that’s stopping the United States from attaining again the\ngreatness Republicans invoke.
