  "text": "Lawyer: Juro® often believe @Mlults over kids\n\n> EPSTEIN from 1B\n\nhis current job, has returned\n$10,000 to him because of the\nPalm Beach scandal, the New\nYork Daily News has reported.\n\nRather than file charges,\nthe state attorney’s office\npresented the case to a\ncounty grand jury. The panel\nindicted Epstein last week on\na single, less serious charge\nof felony solicitation of pros-\ntitution.\n\nThe case raised eyebrows\nbecause the state attorney’s\noffice rarely, if ever, kicks\nsuch charges to a grand jury.\nAnd it increases the difficulty\nof prosecuting child sex\nabuse cases, especially when\nthe defendant is enormously\nwealthy and can hire high-\npriced, top-tier lawyers.\n\nAt least one of Epstein’s\nalleged victims told police he\nknew she was underage\nwhen the two of them got\nnaked for massages and sex-\nual activity. She was 16 years\nold at the time and said Ep-\nstein asked her questions\nabout her high school, ac-\ncording to police reports.\n\nA girl who. said she met\nEpstein when she was 15 said\nhe told her if she told any-\nbody what happened at his\nhouse, bad things could hap-\npen, the police reports state.\n\nEpstein’s youngest al-\nleged victim was 14 when she\nsays she gave him a massage\nthat included some sexual\nactivity. She is now 16. The\ngirl’s father says he doesn’t\nknow whether she told Ep-\nstein her age.\n\n“My daughter has kept a\nlot of what happened from me\nbecause of sheer embarrass-\nment,” he said. “But she very\nmuch looked 14. Any prudent\nman would have had second\nthoughts about that.”\n\nDefense attorney Jack -\n\nGoldberger maintains that\nnot only did Epstein pass a\n\npolygraph test showing he |\n\ndid not know the girls were\nminors, but their stories\nweren’t credible. The state\nattorney’s office also implied\nthat their credibility was an\nissue when it decided not to\ncharge Epstein directly, but\ninstead give the case to the\ngrand jury.\n\n“A prosecutor has to look\nat it in a much broader fash-\nion,” a state attorney’s\nspokesman said last week.\n\nEpstein hired Harvard\nlaw Professor Alan Der-\nshowitz when.he became\naware he was under investi-\n\n. gation, and Dershowitz gave\n\nprosecutors information that\nsome of the alleged victims\nhad spoke of using alcohol\nand marijuana on a popular\nWeb site, according to a Palm\nBeach police report.\n\nProsecutors typically\nconsider two things in decid-\ning whether to charge some-\nbody with sex-related offens-\nes against minors — whether\nthere is sufficient evidence\nand whether there is a public\ntnberest in doing so, Dekle\nsaid.\n\nChild sex abuse cases\noften are difficult\nto prosecute, an\nattorney says.\n\nIftwo teens are in a sexual\nrelationship and the boy\nturns 18 before the girl, he\ncould be charged with a sex\ncrime if the sex continues.\nThere would be no public in-\nterest in pursuing that, Dekle\nsaid.\n\nBut where there is a large\ngap in ages — and especially\nin cases of teachers with: stu-\ndents — there is a public in-\nterestin prosecuting, he said.\nLikewise if the accused has a\ntrack record of sex with mi-\nnors.\n\nStill there is a “universal\nconstant” in prosecuting\nthese cases, Dekle said. Men\nwho exploit underage chil-\ndren for sex often carefully\nchoose their victims in ways\n\n. that will minimize the risk to\n\nthem, he said.\n\nVictims usually are from a\nlower social status, and they\n\nmay suffer from psychologi-\ncal problems, Dekle said.\n\n“Lots of child sexual\nabuse victims have been vic-\ntimized by multiple people\nover a period of time. Then\nthe act of abuse produces\nbehavior in the victims that\nfurther damages their credi-\nbility.” Examples include\npromiscuous behavior and\ndrug abuse.\n\nSome of the alleced vic-\ntims in the Epstein case re-\nturned to his home multiple\ntimes for the massage ses-\nsions and the $200 to $300 he\ntypically paid them per visit.\n“That would be a definite\n\n‘problem for the prosecutor,”\n\nsaid Betty Resch, who prose-\ncuted crimes against children\nin Palm Beach County for five\nyears and now is in private\npractice in Lake Worth.\n\n“The victim becomes less\nsympathetic” to a jury, Resch\nsaid. “But she’s a victim nev-\nertheless. She’s a kid.”\n\nMost men charged with\nsex crimes against minors\nlook normal, Dekle said. A\njury expecting to see a mon-\nster seldom will. And the vic-\n\ntims’ ages work against them\nand in favor of the defendant\nin a trial, Dekle said.\n\nIf a child and an adult tell\ndifferent stories and both\nswear theyre telling the\ntruth, adult jurors are more\nlikely to believe the adult,\nDekle said.\n\n“You have all these things\nworking against you ina child\nsex abuse case. Prosecutors\nnormally try to be very care-\nful in filing those cases be-\ncause they know what they're\ngetting into. There is no such\nthing as an iron-clad child\nsexual abuse case.”\n\n© lany_keller@pbpost.com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018926",
