  "text": "packets or financial vouchers. Protocols embody shared rules. Their subtle, decisive\npower is to place each bit of data ina reliable, predictable order, just as diplomatic\nprotocol might seat ambassadors at a negotiation. “Protocol,” the theorists\nAlexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker have written, “is a system for maintaining\norganization and control in networks.”18\n\nIn a world of older, more traditional power distributions Americans might worry\nabout a day when another language, another “protocol” in a sense — Chinese or\nSpanish, say - would pry the central connective role away from English. Protocols\nare hard to change, of course. So many people have learned English; whole systems\ndepend on its use. To suddenly switch the world’s airline pilots, bond traders and\ncomputer programmers to Chinese or Spanish would hardly be worth the immense\ncost and the colliding confusion such a transfer would demand. But it’s here where\nthe Seventh Sense axiom, that connection changes the nature of an object, gives usa\nnew view. For the first time, as a result of connectivity, a once unimagined\npossibility exists: rapid, real-time machine translation. Fast, ubiquitous network\nlinks mean that the central role of English is boiled away by another language than\nby a connected, intelligent network skin. “Good morning,” is less likely to be\novertaken by a greeting from some other language as it is to be effortlessly, invisibly\ntransmuted into “5 _E 4?” or “Buenos Dias.” Fast access to a great translation\nalgorithm will be more important than the ability to speak English (or Spanish or\nChinese). Even as an advocate of learning other languages, it’s hard not to feel that\nthe American parents now plowing their children urgently into Chinese classes are\nmissing the point. Fluency in any second language in the future will be an arcane\nspecialty. Better to teach the kids how to build an Al, or to debate the moral\nreasoning of Confucius and Socrates than how to order dinner. The machines will\ntake care of that. Power in a connected age will pool, then, not in the mouths and\nminds of English speakers, but rather into the hands of anyone who controls the\nbest translation server.\n\nConnection has changed the nature of several objects here: The language itself, the\npeople who use it - pilots, commodity traders, machines, you and J. You can see how\nthe ability to design, build and turn on (or off) the fastest, smartest, most connected\nlanguage machines becomes a nexus of fresh power. What will replace English isn’t\nSpanish or Chinese, but a protocol. This sort of specialized data-pipe will permit\ninstant, always-improving translation. It will become as crucial to the operation of\nthe global economy or research laboratories or entertainment companies as English\nnow is. More crucial, in fact, because these machines will enable vast new\ncommunication links with a fidelity far better than pidgin-level speech. They will\nconsider not only what we say, but what they suspect we mean to say in the quest of\never clearer discussion. The pre-network instinct of Fear Chinese! Fear Spanish! is\nthe wrong one. As is the idea to teach the world Chinese or Spanish as a source of\npower. Rather, Can we control this turbo-smart connected language platform? is the\nright question. So many of the threats we worry about today have been similarly\n\n18 “Protocol”: Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker, “Protocol, Control, and\nNetworks” in Grey Room 17, Fall 2004, pp. 9\n\n20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018255",
