  "text": "The number and variety of algorithmic strategies for computing Lyapounov\nexponents that are applicable to real data divide naturally into those that compute\n\ndirectly the average rate of separation of neighboring points from the “fiduciary”\n\norbit, as observed on the reconstructed attractor, from which only the largest 2can\nbe obtained (Wolf et al, 1985), and a variety of techniques based on assumed\nmodel maps of the unknown flow along which the sequential products of the local\nderivatives are computed. The logarithms of the straight line slopes of the sequence\nof directionally decomposed local tangent vectors multiplied, yield as many\nLyapounov exponents as directions (Sano and Sawaka, 1985; Eckmann et al, 1986;\nGeist et al, 1990). The techniques of regularization by which these model processes\napproximate the unknown flow include those with least squares, linear fit\nassumptions (Eckmann et al, 1986; Sato et al, 1987; Buzug et al, 1990), more\ndetailed fits involving polynomial expressions in higher powers (Briggs, 1990; Brown\net al, 1991; Bryant et al, 1991) and techniques such as “singular value\ndecomposition” which decomposes the flow into orthogonal components before\ncomputing the logarithmic rate of divergence of nearby points on each of them\n(Stoop and Parisi, 1991). A clever check on the Lyapounov number obtained is to\nstudy the flow backwards so that, for example, some rate of separation of points in\nthe forward direction would approximate the rate of convergence in the time\nreversed data (Parlitz, 1992).\n\nAmong the sources of spurious Lyapounov exponents are sample lengths\nthat are too short and/or too measurement-noisy to compute a statistically stable\naverage, embedding dimensions that are too high or low and attractors (many of\nphysiological relevance) that have geometric features such as sharp corners or tight\nfolds as in the Réssler (where points gather) or delicate boundary points such as\nthose on the body on the Lorenz butterfly (see above) where very small distances\ndetermine whether the orbit makes big jumps to the right or left wing leading to\nuncharacteristically large separations. This “nonuniformity” in the rates of expansion\nand contraction in the dynamics over the attractor, a source of error in computations\nof statistical indices of the average behavior, becomes a _ useful tool in\n\ncharacterizing individual differences in sets of neurobiological data ranging from\n\n220\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013720",
