Mr.\nWeymer said he believes it is important to look at the track record of this property\nin considering the fine. The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance,\nadministrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $500.00, which is the\nmaximum fine for a repeat violation.\n\nMr. Hoffman said it seemed that every time the property owner gets notified he\ncomes into compliance but he has to be notified.
