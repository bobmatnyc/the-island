  "text": "The world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure\nwalls—looking out at an angry and uncomprehending world—and the Mail\nand social media and upholders of new norms, seeing Epstein as a useful and\nterrible symbol and baying for his blood.\n\nHe is all bad things rolled into one: the financier whose wealth is a\nproduct of abstraction rather than work; a rich middle-age white man who\nnot only parades his wealth and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to\nboot; an unreconstructed sybarite and feminist nightmare; an insistent\nPlayboy in a correct and prudish world; someone who somehow didn’t get\nthe memo about vast changes in mores and culture.\n\nWhen I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus is\nto get married, he said he would rather go back to jail.\n\nHe is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.\n\nAnd worse, although he has been jailed for 18 months and paid out\nwhat may be as much as $20 million, he seems somehow to have gotten\naway with it too—that worst sin of all.\n\nThis is all, inevitably, a Gatsby-like story, except with none of the\nsentimentality or romantic longings accorded Gatsby—or at least that Nick\nCaraway and Fitzgerald accord him. Gatsby in New York Post and Daily\nMail parlance would be a freaky financier too.\n\nAnd that partly is the issue, Jeffrey Epstein story isn’t one for black\nand white journalists. It’s a complicated story, real but necessarily fictional,\na long-running cable series, perhaps, not an ordinary good-bad, right-wrong\ntale, but a premium one, compelling precisely because it is about all the\nambitions and impulses that we are afraid of, not least of all because for\nmany of us they exist within ourselves.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022969",
