Darren, if you want to call me and \nread me the highlights, I can type them on a Word Doc as you dictate...(?) (Even when Scott opened them on \nhis end he had no highlights) \nForwarded message \nFrom: Scott Denett \nDate: Sun, Apr 3, 2011 at 10:04 AM \nSubject: raw text \nTo: Lesley Groff < \nAccording to Friday's NY Post Jeffrey Epstein returned to New York City \"making wisecracks about his just-\nended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl\". \"I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 'offender, ' \" the Wall \nStreet hedge fund manager told The Post. \"It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a \nbagel,\" said Epstein. \nWell that's not exactly the correct analogy... \nNot only are Epstein's comments brazen, they are arrogant and self-implicating. By telling a reporter \"I'm an \noffender\", he seems to be admitting guilt. \nWhich brings me to the big question of the day. Why did Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan D.A., allow a Level \n3 sex offender (the most dangerous kind) to reside -- even for ten minutes -- in a house that is right next to \nCentral Park and a school? Isn't that unlawful given the housing guidelines for sex offenders? \nAccording to the NYPost, Epstein's Level 3 designation means that he is at \"high risk\" to repeat his offense and \nposes \"a threat to public safety.\" \nWhen I rang Vance (twice) to discuss Epstein's residential guidelines he did not take my calls. \nAccording to a few of the attorneys who represented Epstein's victims in the civil cases, the financier never \nagreed to a psychological evaluation prior to or during his sentence, a requirement of all sexual predators. \nWhile Epstein's self-incriminating statements are published (this week he told the Post \"the crime that was \nsupposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York\" -- an interesting choice of words -- he continues \nto mock the law that applies to all other sex offenders who are found guilty of the same crime. \nEpstein served 13 months in the West Palm Beach Stockade and 18 months under community control (a rather \npermissive version of house arrest), for 2 Counts of Solicitation of Prostitution with a Minor. \nIn August of 2010, immediately following his release from \"community control\", Epstein returned to his $50 \nmillion East 71st Street town house given to him by his former client and long time friend Leslie Wexner. \nJust in the last few weeks he held a house warming dinner to celebrate his release from jail and reportedly \ninvited television reporters Katie Couric, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulus and his close friend, HRH \nPrince Andrew, according to the NY Post. \nYou would think these professional television reporters would have done their homework prior to accepting his \ninvitation no matter how desperate they were to rub elbows with Prince Andrew. \nAccording to a 53-page sealed indictment Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple counts of statutory \nrape, and child sex trafficking. \nCourt documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out girls as young as 14 and paid them $200 to $1,000 \nfor sexually explicit massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan. \nIn the New York sex-offender database, Epstein isn't registered under a zip code rather a \"name search\" option \nthat does not list his New York address. \nThe reason for this is because Epstein's Upper East Side home is considered \"temporary\" and by NY state law, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029766 \nhe is required to provide only his permanent address to the database. \nEpstein is currently listed under his Florida home even though he is no longer a Florida resident either (after his \narrest he immediately became a US VI resident), but then again who's keeping count? \nOnce again these are mere technicalities when it comes to Epstein's sexual predator case. The two most \ndisturbing parts of this story are that this could easily happen again and that once again there will be no justice. \nHad Epstein been a caring benefactor contributing to society and these young girl's education and well being \nthen the world would have judged him differently. \nWhat he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage to hundreds of underage girls who \ncould have been sponsored towards a better education. \nWith respect to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, I'm confused by his decision to allow this sexual predator to live \nat his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun control as \nwitnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPost when asked about a Florida driver cleared in a Manhattan \nweapon's charge, \"guns brought illegally into New York City\" he said, \" for any reason violate well established \nstate laws and are a threat to our public safety\". \nThen wouldn't a registered sex offender living 500 feet from a park (Central Park where young girls \ncongregate), and with resources to spare be an even more dangerous threat to society? \nThe Billionaire Pedophile's Sex Den \nby Conchita Sarnoff javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:;javascript:; \n• http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/j effrey-epstein-pedophile-billionaire-and-his-sex-den/full/ \n• javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:void(0) \n• Email \n• javascript:void(0) \n• \nNewscom Hedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived in a \ndepraved world of thrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now \nbeing revealed. Conchita Sarnoff reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: \n• Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the bathroom soap was shaped like sex \norgans \n• Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three massage appointments each day \n• The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than Epstein—for trying to sell notes \nregarding massage appointments \n• Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling agency MC2 \n• According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2—often from Eastern \nEurope—then traveled on Epstein's private jets \nJeffrey Epstein's loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously lenient. \nThey insist that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and essentially harmless. \nAs the police records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could \"say no\" at any \ntime during a massage as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in \nevery victim's statement: First she would be asked to remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt to \nfondle her buttocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator. There was sometimes digital \npenetration, and the more willing girls were lured into full-blown sexual relations with both Epstein and Nadia \nMarcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts and police reports as Epstein's live-in \"sex slave.\" \nA former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed \nthat MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein's private jets. \nIt's true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several \ntimes—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029767 \nparticularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this case—judging by \narrangements at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organized his life \naround this sexual compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law. \n• Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe  \n• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free  \nAccording to police who executed a search warrant, the house was decorated with large, framed photos of nude \nyoung girls, and similar images were found stashed in an armoire and on the computers seized at the house \n(although police found only bare cables where other computers had been). Some bathrooms were stocked with \nsoap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a \"twin torpedo\" vibrator and creams and \nlubricants available at erotic specialty shops, were stowed near the massage tables set up in several rooms \nupstairs. \nEpstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, \nand Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would \nnot be charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their \nother duties, worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily \"massages\" was stocked with \nfresh recruits. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, \nwho was for many years Epstein's live-in partner, also recruited young girls. \nSince his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen \nlawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a \nscheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net \nworth. \nThe victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often \ngave them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named \nLupita, who was a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage \nsessions, picking up soiled towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein \nwith the pope hung next to one of him with a young girl. \nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced to more \njail time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein's activities. He was fired, he says, \nfor inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to \ncollect money. He saw an unfamiliar \"beater\" in the driveway one evening and called 911. When he left \nEpstein's employ, Rodriguez took away some notes and emails about massage appointments as \"protection\" \nagainst his own prosecution, and failed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial \ninvestigation. \n• javascript:;javascript:; \n• http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophi le-billionaire-and-hi s-sex-den/full/ \n• javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:void(0) \n• Email \n• javascript:void(0) \n• \nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this \n\"golden nugget\"—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the \noffer to an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with \"obstruction of official proceedings\" for \nwithholding information that could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point \nhad been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to \nserve 13 months in the Palm Beach county jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal \ncourt in Miami for transporting firearms, another deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job. \nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000 in cash \non hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who \nbrought them to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029768 \nDepartment, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid \nbeing stopped or ticketed by local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, \nacknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-\nheeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. \nThe police were still researching the purchase when Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the \nmoney returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein's local attorneys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to \nthe Florida Ballet for massages, because he was \"very passionate\" about massages being \"therapeutically and \nspiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage training.) \nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, \nowner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova \n\"deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly \ngirls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.\" (Which would amount to trafficking.) \nBrunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He \nlives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, \nMiami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been \nobserved as a house guest at Epstein's Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New \nYork, where Epstein owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch. \nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted in \nMichael Gross' book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugly Business QfBeautiful Women. Pyes told \nthe author that Brunel \"ranks among the sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking about a \nconveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls were not only harassed but molested.\" Now The Daily \nBeast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire transfer to Brunel's offshore bank account in \nSeptember 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan or a backdoor investment in \nthe new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving evidence in the Epstein \ninvestigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April of Brunel's activities, \nEpstein said \"I'm 100 percent convinced that he doesn't traffic children.\" (Brunel has never been charged.) \nAn American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very \nbeautiful; many were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency's \nMiami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became \nfrequent guests on Epstein's private jets. \nPilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. Other \ntimes, the pilot would just list the other passengers plus \"female.\" \nPosted 02 August 2010 - 12:47 AM \nJeffrey Epstein, Jew Billionaire Pedophile, Child Trafficker Goes Free-WoW! 20 year old Hearsay is enough to destroy catholic priest.

She is writing a book about child trafficking in America. \nHedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived in a depraved world of \nthrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now being revealed. Conchita \nSarnoff follows up on her investigation of the legal wrangling that saved him from a long prison term and \nreports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: \n• Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein's \"special treatment\" and gave The Daily Beast an exclusive \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029769 \nlook at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation. \n• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have landed \nEpstein in prison for 20 years. \n• Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former Soviet \nrepublics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift. \n• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be evidence of \nsex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was convicted of \n• Epstein's attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered private \ninvestigators to follow and intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. \n• Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he \"would have instructed the Justice \nDepartment to pursue justice without making a political mess.\" \nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of \nprivilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm \nBeach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski's time at a Swiss ski chalet. \nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis \nDuring Epstein's term of \"house arrest,\" he made several trips each month to his New York home and his \nprivate Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor-13 \nmonths in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled \nmore than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform \"massages\" at his \nPalm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each \nreceived well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. \n• Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe \n• The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den \nWith that, the known victims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against \nhim is closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of \nthe U.S. and may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile. \nBut the question remains: Did Epstein's wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince \nAndrew; former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury \nSecretary Larry Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive \nonly a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless \nassets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, \nand Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice? \nEpstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe \nhttp://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork  \nThe Justice Department is investigating Jeffrey Epstein for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has learned—and \nhas widened the scope of its probe to include a famous modeling agency. \nHedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last week. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029770 \nBut it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that: \n• Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein's activities, to see whether there is evidence of child \ntrafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the arrangement \nbetween Epstein and the Department of Justice allowing him to plead guilty to lower-level state crimes. \nTrafficking can carry a 20-year sentence. \n• The FBI is also investigating Epstein's friend Jean Luc Brunel, whose MC2 modeling agency appears to have \nbeen a source of girls from overseas who ended up on Epstein's private jets. \nBecause Epstein's predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, there \nmay well be more evidence to uncover. \nUnder the concept of double jeopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges covered by \nhis non-prosecution agreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of incarceration, fund the civil suits of \nnamed victims, and register as a sex offender. The victims who accepted cash settlements in these civil suits \nagreed not to testify against him or speak publicly about the case. However, new evidence developed by the \nDepartment of Justice on other offenses not covered by the agreement, including allegations by additional \nvictims who come forward, could lead to new charges. There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-\ntrafficking law, which was also enacted by the state of Florida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch \nback many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, there may well be more evidence to uncover. \n(Several young women who claim to be Epstein victims have recently contacted a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer, but to \ndate no new civil complaints have been filed.) \n• Conchita Sarnoff: The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den \n• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free \nThese new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about \nEpstein's pattern of sexual contact with underage girls, which Palm Beach police began investigating in 2005 \nand the U.S. Attorney's office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. The first article quoted a deposition by then-\nPalm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter, in which he stated that Epstein, a billionaire with many powerful \nfriends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his incarceration. Although federal \ninvestigators at one point produced a draft 53-page indictment against Epstein, he was eventually allowed to \nplead guilty to only two relatively minor state charges and receive a short term of incarceration: 13 months in \nthe county jail, during which he went to the office every day, and one year of community control, during which \nhe traveled frequently to New York and his private island in the Virgin Islands. \nThe Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which Epstein apparently received special \nconsideration: As a convicted sex offender, he is required by law to undergo an impartial psychological \nevaluation prior to sentencing and to receive psychiatric treatment during and after incarceration. This is \nbecause child molesters tend to be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According to a source in law \nenforcement, however, Epstein was allowed to submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr. Stephen \nAlexander of Palm Beach, Florida, whose phone has since been disconnected with no forwarding information. \nThe Daily Beast's second article provided details about Epstein's systematic abuse of underage girls at his \nPalm Beach mansion, where members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers, most of \nthem 16 or younger, to perform daily massages that devolved into masturbation, groping, and sometimes full-\nblown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between Epstein and Jean Luc Brunel, a frequent \nvisitor to whom he gave $1 million around the same time that Brunel was starting his MC2 modeling agency. \nSome of the young girls MC2 recruited from overseas—often from Eastern Europe and South America—are \nknown to have been passengers on Epstein's private jets. \nThe U.S. Attorney General's Office in Florida says that it is against policy to confirm or deny the existence of \nan investigation. Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer, Jack Goldberger, says he has no knowledge of an ongoing probe, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029771 \nand he told The Daily Beast, \"Jeffrey Epstein has fully complied with all state and federal requirements that \narise from the prior proceedings in Palm Beach. There are no pending civil lawsuits. There are not and should \nnot be any pending criminal investigations, given Mr. Epstein's complete fulfillment of all the terms of his non-\nprosecution agreement with the federal government.\" \nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has \nproduced three current-events debate TV programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment \nfor The Oppenheimer Report.
