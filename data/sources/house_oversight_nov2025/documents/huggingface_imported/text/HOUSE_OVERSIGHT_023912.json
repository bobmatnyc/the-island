  "text": "166 Teaching Minds\n\nPlanning. What I said about diagnosis is also true of planning. We\nplan in everything we do. There are economic plans, architectural\nplans, medical treatment plans, business plans, and so on. A computer\nprogram is a type of plan, and research plans are everywhere in a\nuniversity. Writing these plans is not so different in principle, but in\nreality a business plan doesn’t look much like a treatment plan. So\nthere is the idea of a good plan and the understanding of what a plan\nlooks like, what a plan’s description ought to be like, in any area of\nlife. You may think a business plan should look a certain way, but if\nthe business community has a different idea, that idea will turn out\nto be right.\n\nStudents should have the opportunity to write all kinds of plans,\nlearning about the principles of planning while learning about what\nofficially is considered to be a good plan in an area of the real world\nthat interests them.\n\nSo, as part of the second year, students should get to study plan-\nning, and then study successful planning documents, and then write\nplans and have them evaluated by the faculty.\n\nCausation. Who studies causation? Everybody. Psychologists\nworry about what makes people crazy, doctors worry about what\nmakes people sick, environmentalists worry about what is ruining\nthe planet. Physicists want to know how the world works. Computer\nscientists want to know how computers can work better. Engineers do\nnothing but causation, really. So, here again, determining causes is a\nbasic cognitive skill and it can be learned within the second year as\nwell, in the same way I have been describing building on what came\nin the first year to tackle complex problems of causation in areas that\ninterest the students.\n\nSocial Processes\n\nDescribing can easily be taught, as all of the eight processes dis-\ncussed above are taught by requiring students to present their work in\nwritten and oral form. Students need to learn to write but they also\nneed to learn to talk and to use alternative media to make their points\nand to explain what they have done. A coherent course of study in\nhow to describe properly is easily within the ability of any college fac-\nulty and ought to be its highest priority, taught from many different\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023912",
