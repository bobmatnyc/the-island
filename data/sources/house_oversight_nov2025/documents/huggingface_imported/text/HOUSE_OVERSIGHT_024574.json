United States Federal Income Taxation\n\nThe following summary sets forth the material U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the\npurchase, ownership, and disposition of Common LP Units. Unless otherwise stated, this summary deals\nonly with partners that are U.S. Persons (as defined below) who purchase their Common LP Units in this\noffering and who hold their Common LP Units as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the\nCode. The following discussion is only a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax matters as\ndescribed herein and does not purport to address ail of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that\nmay be relevant to a particular Limited Pariner of KUE (“Limited Partner’) in light of such Limited Partner's\nspecific circumstances. In addition, except as expressly stated, the following summary does not address\nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to special classes of Limited Partners\nwho may be subject to special rules or treatment under the Code, such as financial institutions, insurance\ncompanies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, or other pass-\nthrough entities, dealers or traders in securities, tax-exempt organizations, expatriates, any person who\nowns or is deemed to own, for U.S. federal income tax purpose, 10% or more of the total combined voting\npower of all classes of voting stock of the corporate subsidiaries of KUE, persons that have a \"functional\ncurrency\" other than the United States dollar, and any individual who is a non-U.S. Person (as defined\nbelow} and who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in a taxable year. This discussion does not\ninclude any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments within the U.S. No ruling has\nbeen or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed herein. Counsel to KUE has not\nrendered any legal opinion regarding any tax consequences relating to KUE or an investment in KUE. No\nassurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position\ncontrary to any of the positions taken by KUE as set forth below.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Person\" means (1) a citizen or resident of the U.S., (2) a\ncorporation created or organized in or under the laws of any Stafe of the U.S. (including the District of\nColumbia}, (3) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its\nsource, (4) a trust if either (a) a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the\nadministration of such trust and one cr more U.S, Persons have the authority to control all substantial\ndecisions of such trust or (b) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. Person for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, or (5) any other person or entity that is treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as if it were one of the foregoing. The term \"“non-U.S. Person” means any person other than a\nU.S. Person.\n\n18.2.1 United States Federal Income Taxation of KUE and its Subsidiaries\n\nPartnership Status of KUE. KUE believes that it should be classified as a partnership for United States\nfederal income tax purposes. Accordingly, KUE fs not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income\ntax liability. Instead, each Partner will be allocated its share of KUE’s income or loss, as the case may be,\nfor United States federal income tax purposes as set forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement. [n\naddition, each U.S. Partner's share of income or loss from KUE generaily will be required to be includable\nin income for state and local tax purposes in the jurisdiction in which the investor is a resident and in the\njurisdictions in which KUE operates. Each U.S. Partner will be responsible for paying the income tax on\nthat portion of KUE’s income allocated to such investor. No assurances can be given that any cash\ndistribution will be made from KUE to the partners to pay such income tax liabilities.\n\nUnder the Code, certain non-U.S corporations may be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, thereby subjecting such non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income tax on their\nincome. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation includes one such provision. Under this legislation,\nreferred to as the anti-inversion legislation, non-U.S. corporations that acquire interests in a U.S.\ncorporation or partnership and meet certain ownership, operational and other tests may be treated as U.S.\ncorporations for federal income tax purposes. The legislation grants broad regulatory authority to the U.S.\nSecretary of Treasury to provide such regulations as may be appropriate to determine whether a non-US.\ncorporation is treated as a U.S. corporation or as are necessary to carry out the intent of the provision,\nincluding adjusting its application as necessary to prevent the avoidance of its purpose.
