  "text": "surrounded by the flora! green carpet of mossy grass that covered the\nearthly skyscraper and falling fog, it was like being carried to heaven or\nthe closest thing to it! Taking my eyes off the scenery and catching him\nadoringly staring at me again, I welled up with unstoppable tears. “I am\nso lucky, is this really happening?” He squeezed my hands and replied\nback “‘You’re the only one for me...I love you!” relieving the anxiety\nwritten all over my tear stained face.\n\nChapter 22\n\nGetting out of the carriage we were greeted by good fortune from the\nGods above. A sun shower cascaded over us at we advanced into the\nancient holy temple. My tears of joy dried and my happiness was glowing\nfor all to see. The many visitors to the temple stopped and took photos of\nthe passing bride and groom, no other foreigners had ever been married\nthere and certainly anyone wearing traditional western wedding attire,\nsuch a sight had never been seen behind these religious walls, we became\na permanent icon at the temple. The ceremony was done in the Buddhist\ncustoms according to their ancestral accordance, and translated for us in\nour own language. Both Robbie and I were anointed with a blessing from\nthe monk with a splash of water and seven sacramental bracelets, each\none representing another meaning to the longevity of our union together.\nWe signed our names in the Buddhist wedding registry of Doi Cept\nTemple and officially became Mr. & Mrs. Roberts at least officially in\nour hearts knowing the laws of Australia only recognize certified\nweddings, meaning when we got back to his homeland we’d have to\nmake a run for the courthouse. This was our real wedding though, perfect\ndown to every detail. Walking up to the highest point of the temple to the\nbalcony hanging over the edge of a cliff side over looking the city of\nChang-Mai, we knew we had found the perfect spot to recite our vows of\nlove to each other. Providing everything for me and more than I could\never ask for, his vows were to love me unconditionally until death do we\npart, shelter me from all the cruelty in the world that I was so accustomed\ntoo and to be like the bear, because the bear never forgets. Tears once\nagain streamed down from my eyes as he made this moment\nunforgettable. Wiping the mascara fading undermeath my eyelids whilst\ngiggling at my embarrassment | took his hands back into mine again and\ngave him the vows that were the sacred prepared words from my heart.\nMy ears were thundering the sound of a million horses hoofs descending\ndownhill and my heart was beating so fast my words barely trembled out\nof my mouth when I began to tell him how much he had changed my\n\n129\n\nJ Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL.\n\nwhole life around and how I would dedicate my entire being to loving\nhim and only him until | blew my final breath.\n\nI meant every word that I said to him, this was it for me, wanting\nnothing more out of life than to be with someone like him to raise a few\nkids together and grow old on the front porch letting the days fade us by.\nI know it probably sounds boring to most and it would’ve to me as well\nmany years ago but after the life | had led, I had enough experience in the\nreal world for my liking and now all I want to do is to enjoy the\nremaining days of my life for what it is...a simple and satisfying\nexistence. Our day was so special but not only to us, even too the Monk\nthat married us. Upon our descent down the lifts he asked if he could take\na photo with the bride and groom in front of their symbolic liberty bell\nsignifying the union between east and west. It represented a lot for us too,\nit was the commencement of a new life together and just the beginning of\nbattling each other’s past demons together.\n\nKissing the bridal party goodbye, who were just the local girls I had\nmet on some of our many nights out of having fun. | threw my arranged\nbouquet of Thailand’s white wedding floras mixed with colorful orchids\nto the screaming Thai women behind me and we were given one last\ntradition to take with us, the release of caged doves. It was such an\nincredible gesture, especially for me. Symbolizing their freedom as well\nas mine I opened the cage’s door to let them free to decide our own fates.\nAs the wings on the birds began to spread open and they took their final\ndecent into the blue skies granting themselves freedom | knew mine had\nfinally come too. The relevance of watching them fly away and how I had\nperceived my own day of marriage related to the identical feeling of\nfleeing an entrapment of my own kind. | was liberated from the bounds of\nslavery I had come to know over the many years I had spent with my fair\nshare of greedy perverted old men only to have serendipity mend my\nscars with the powerful healing of what true love has to endeavor on.\n\nAs customary in the romance novels I had read as a young girl he\npicked me up in the hallway before our hotel suite and carried me over\nthe threshold, poufy dress and all. My arms were tightly squeezed around\nhis neck never once taking my eyes off of him until he revealed yet\nanother sweet surprise. Besides the cleaners tiding up my room while we\nwere gone they were also given instructions by none other than the groom\nhimself to pick the petals off the stems of red roses to place on our bed in\nthe shape of a giant heart. The rose petals led the way to where we\nconsummated our love physically and it was undeniably the first time in\nmy life I had really ever been made love too. Hours had passed by before\nwe thought about anything else besides one another’s words of arousal,\ntantalizing touches, and lingering kisses. We ate a quiet dinner ata local\nrestaurant and went straight back to the arms of each other again, so\n\n130\n\nG Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUTFRLE004263\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021209",
