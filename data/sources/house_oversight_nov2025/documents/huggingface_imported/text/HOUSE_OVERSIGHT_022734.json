  "text": "Perhaps it’s just the ultimate feminist nightmare: Men (and a few\nopportunistic women) continue to come to Epstein’s because, no matter their\npublic bows to modern manners, they simply don’t care that he offends\nevery aspect of feminist sensibility\n\nOr, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange\n“Jeffrey” stories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate\nbillionaire and publisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of\nEpstein), with a twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of\nEpstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems delighted to\ncultivate. In Epstein’s Paris apartment, 10,000 square feet on the Avenue\nFoch, a neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a\nstuffed baby elephant in his living room—that 1s, the elephant in the room.\n(At the same time, Epstein is a major supporter of cancer research and the\nelephant, he says, is also a reminder that elephants have 23 copies of tumor\nsuppressor genes and humans have only 1.) The single book on his bedside\ntable is Lolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).\n\nOr, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the\nworld. There is a media version of the world, which most of us live in and\nlargely accept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those\npeople who live in the media itself and therefore know that it’s mostly bunk.\nIf the media says it, as likely some version of the opposite is true. I might\nguess too that for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there\nbut for the grace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time,\nrun afoul of prosecutors, the political moment, the media, or the Internet hoi\npolloi.\n\nEpstein is the Dreyfus of the rich.\n\nAnd then there is the glue of wealth. Once, at lunch in the Epstein\ndinning room with Bill Richardson, the former Governor of New Mexico,\nand past Presidential aspirant, when Epstein left the room for a few minutes,\nI asked the obvious question, the one everybody asks each other, “How did\nyou meet Jeffrey?” Richardson seemed surprised: “Jeffrey,” he said, as\nthough stating what should have been perfectly obvious, “is the biggest\nlandowner in New Mexico.”\n\nAnd then there is Epstein’s yet more structural explanation as to why\nafter prison and with continuing tabloid infamy he can maintain his valued\nplace. It comes back, not unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money:\n\n“At a certain level of finance, almost everyone is allied with an\ninstitutional interest. You are part of government, or you want to be in\ngovernment, or you are connected to a bank or other portfolio, or you have\nkey relationships with certain corporations or industries.
