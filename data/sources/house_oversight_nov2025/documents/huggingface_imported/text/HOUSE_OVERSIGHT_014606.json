Meanwhile, any boost to emerging market\nexports from the modest pickup in global growth\nwe expect is likely to be dwarfed by ongoing US\ntrade policy uncertainty, European political risk\nand China fears. Lastly, an acceleration of recent\noutflows from EMLD markets could magnify these\nrisks, particularly since 60% of the cumulative\ninflows into the asset class since 2004 are\nexperiencing losses at current market levels.\n\nAlthough the number of concerns is large, so is\nthe risk premium of the asset class. As previously\nseen in Exhibit 76, the currencies in the EMLD\nindex are 15% undervalued. From this starting\npoint, the asset class could deliver attractive total\nreturns if US trade policy proves to be more benign\nthan feared and China worries abate.\n\nConsidering this balance of risks, our central\ncase calls for low single-digit returns. While\npositive, this return is not sufficient to justify\na tactical long position in EMLD in our view,\ngiven the still considerable downside risks\ndiscussed above.\n\nEmerging Market Dollar Debt\n\nEmerging market dollar debt (EMD) returned 10%\nin 2016, capping a surprising four-year period\n\nof outperformance that has greatly benefited\n\nfrom stable US rates and dollar strength. But the\nprospects for a fifth year of upside are questionable\nfor several reasons.\n\nFirst, EMD’s almost seven-year duration is\na liability in a rising-rate environment. This is\nparticularly true now that the Federal Reserve\nhas resumed tightening policy, a fact evident in\nEMD’s 4.3% drop in response to increasing rate\nhike expectations late last year. Second, with\nspreads standing near two-year lows, there is scope\nfor spread widening based on US and European\npolicy uncertainty and renewed China growth\nfears. Third, countries accounting for 37% of\nEMD— including Mexico, China, South Africa\nand Brazil—have negative outlooks from at least\ntwo rating agencies, raising the potential for\ndowngrades.! A potential default by Venezuela\nand its national oil company could also sour\nsentiment, as could unfavorable tariffs or trade\nrestrictions from the new US administration.\nFinally, the backup in interest rates we expect\ncould raise funding costs for EM corporate issuers,\nwhich could also heighten concerns about spillover\ninto EMD. Indeed, a recent stress test by Standard\n& Poor’s revealed that EM corporate borrowers—\nwho must repay $200 billion per year through\n2020'*°—are twice as susceptible to downgrades\nas US corporates if dollar funding costs rise by\na third.17?\n\nBased on the above, we do not recommend a\ntactical position in EMD at this time.\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 73\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014606",
