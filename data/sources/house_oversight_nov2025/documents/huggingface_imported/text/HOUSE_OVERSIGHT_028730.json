  "text": "As for the sanctions, they may hurt ordinary Iranians but this regime is\nfamously indifferent to the suffering of its own people. The Ayatollah also\ndoesn't seem to take the Administration's talk about \"all options being on\nthe table\" seriously. Mr. Obama's nomination of Iran dove Chuck Hagel to\nbe Secretary of Defense reinforces that impression, as do reports that the\nWhite House blocked Pentagon and CIA plans to arm the opposition that's\nfighting to overthrow Iran's client regime in Damascus. An America that\nwon't help proxies in a proxy war isn't likely to take the fight directly to\nIran's nuclear facilities.\n\nIn rejecting Mr. Biden's offer, the Ayatollah said frankly, \"I'm not a\ndiplomat; I'm a revolutionary.\" Another round of multilateral talks with\nIran is set to resume this month, but maybe Joe Biden and his boss should\nstart taking no for an answer.\n\nArticle 2.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nLet's face it: Obama's Iran policy ts failing\n\nJames Traub\n\nFebruary 8, 2013 -- There is no better example of an Obama\nadministration initiative that has succeeded on its own terms, and yet\nfailed as policy, than Iran. By engaging the regime in Tehran, and being\nrebuffed, the White House has been able to enlist China, Russia, and the\nEuropean Union in imposing tough sanctions on Iran. By steadily\nratcheting up those sanctions, the administration has been able to\ngradually squeeze the Iranian economy. By insisting that \"containment\" is\nnot an option, Obama has persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu that he need not launch an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities --\nat least not any time soon.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028730",
