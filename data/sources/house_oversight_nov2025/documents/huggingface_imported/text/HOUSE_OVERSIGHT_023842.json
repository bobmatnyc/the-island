  "text": "96 Teaching Minds\n\nA story-centered curriculum is intended to teach cognitive pro-\ncesses, not subjects. Subjects are, of course, covered, but they are not\nreally the point. Certain things need to be done again and again in\nlife, but those things can be learned only in context, not as an ab-\nstraction. Different contexts must be provided in order to motivate\nstudents and to provide real-world skills that will be remembered, not\nbecause they were studied and tested, but because they were practiced\nagain and again.\n\nWhat is life like in a story-centered curriculum? The first ones we\nbuilt were built as master’s degree programs at Carnegie Mellon’s new\nWest Coast campus. Here is Max Soderby, a mentor in the first one of\nthose master’s programs, talking about his experience:\n\nIam almost jealous in a way because I see that they are gaining\nskills more rapidly than I gained them when I was a student in\nPittsburgh at CMU’s campus. They get exposure to things that\nwe just talked about in a lecture hall, whereas they are actually\ndoing it: implementing actual software and putting designs\ninto practice. We mostly did homework and talked about it ina\nlecture hall. So I am jealous in that respect. It is also a lot more\nwork, but that work pays off for the students.\n\nSubject-based education is not really supposed to be training for work.\nI once proposed to the president of Yale (Bart Giamatti) that we build\na master’s degree program in an area of computer science that would\nhelp get people jobs after graduation. He said that that was training\nand that Yale does not do training. The academic subjects taught at\nYale are meant to produce scholars. But, in a way, he was very wrong.\nYale does do training. Yale and almost all other colleges are divided\ninto departments, and a major in a department’s subject typically\nis seen by the faculty as preparation for an academic career in that\nsubject.\n\nThe students may well have a different point of view, however.\nUnfortunately, they come away disappointed. An English major could\nbe hoping to become a journalist, but the education that he will re-\nceive is more likely to be appropriate for creating an English profes-\nsor. A math major may well want to be an actuary, but will not learn\nactuarial science at Yale. He will learn to be a potential mathematics\nprofessor. And, worst of all, in my own field of computer science, the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023842",
