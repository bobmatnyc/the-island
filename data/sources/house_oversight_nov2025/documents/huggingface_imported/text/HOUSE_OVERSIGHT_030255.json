He had been publicly \nconnected to the former President and became a proxy for the considerable anger at high levels of the Federal \ngovernment that still surrounded Clinton. Likewise now, one reason to revive the story is that it is a way to tar a \nTrump administration official, who, in the normal course of his duties, happened to deal with the case. \nOn Sat, Dec 15, 2018 at 11:28 AM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nthoughts. \n----------Forwarded message--------- \nFrom: Ken Starr < \nDate: Sat, Dec 15, 2018 at 11:24 AM \nSubject: Re: \nTo: J <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nCc: Alan Dershowitz \nHere goes: \n\"Sweetheart deal! \" So goes the critique of the resolution of a long-ago case involving our former client -- and \nnow-friend -- Jeffrey Epstein. The critique is profoundly misplaced, supported neither by the law or the facts, \nnor by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was subjected to an unprecedented \nfederal intrusion into a quintessentially local criminal matter in south Florida. His offense to the social order --\ninvolving sex for hire -- was entirely a matter entrusted to laws of the several States, not the federal \ngovernment. His conduct -- a classic state offense --was being treated exactly that way by able, honest \nprosecutors in Palm Beach County, but the overweening federal government intruded where it did not \nbelong. And now, over ten years after the fact, the current assault on federal decision-makers at the time, \nincluding now-Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta (then the United States Attorney in south Florida), condemns \nthe federal authorities for not going far enough. \nThe critics are entirely wrong. Neither the facts nor the law support the misguided criticisms being leveled by \njournalists and politicians at federal officials from over a decade ago -- including the highest levels of the \nJustice Department in Washington, D.C.. \nHere are the key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made businessman with no prior criminal history \nwhatever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounts to solicitation of prostitution. That was wrong, and it was \nreasonably viewed as a violation of Florida state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs and the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030255 \nlike were involved, the unsavory facts were carefully assessed by experienced state prosecutors who \naggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public \norder. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 15-month \ninvestigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by a state grand jury \non a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution. \nDuring that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met \nface-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility -- or lack thereof -- and considered \nthe extent of exculpatory evidence. Then, after months of elaborate negotiations, the state prosecutors believed \nthey had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely \nconsistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. \nThen, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. Epstein's situation into \nits vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long \nlast, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the \nstate. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the \nfederal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due \nprocess. For example, the agreement required Mr. Epstein to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims \n$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that Jeffrey pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified \nvictims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported \nthis extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from Alaska \ninvolving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges. \nUnder the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the \nagreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. Jeffrey complied, \nserved that sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated \nindividuals. His conduct was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. He continued \nhis work, including his many philanthropic efforts. \nOur friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He has also paid out millions of dollars to the asserted \nvictims and their highly-creative lawyers. For over ten years, he has lived an exemplary life, including \ncarrying on his wide-ranging philanthropies. Those of us who represented him in the Florida proceedings -- for \ncustomary professional fees -- now count him as a trusted friend. \nOur nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human \ndignity. Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the \nworkplace. But Jeffrey, an exemplary employer, has long since been called to account by the criminal justice \nsystem for his misdeeds of yesteryear. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances, that \nunhappy chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-magnificent life should be allowed to close once and for all. \nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2018 at 4:24 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nken ,would take a stab at the article for the law journal. ? thx \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
