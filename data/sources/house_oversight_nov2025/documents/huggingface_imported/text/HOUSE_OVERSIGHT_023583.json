Since then, volatility has once again collapsed (10d realized is at 4.6%) and the\nS&P 500 term structure of volatility has steepened with the 3m-1m spread trading in\nthe 90\" 2y %-ile. Low S&P 500 short-dated vols pushed down the back end of the curve\n(ly and beyond), while Russell 2000 1y+ vols remained bid (Chart 19}. Last week, the VIX\nprinted 2 of its 15 closes below 10 since 1990 (Chart 20). Vol-of-vol remained\nsupported with the VVIX/VIX ratio setting yet another record (8.58) on Friday. All of this\n\nhappened as SPX, NDX and INDU finished the week at all-time highs.\n\nChart 19: In the trading sessions following the political turmoil and\nensuing volatility spike on 17-May, long-term vols (ly and above) reset\nlower for SPX but remained bid for RTY\n\n20%\n18% 20%\n16% 15%\n14%\n12% ies\n0\n10% 5%\n8%\n6% us\n0\n4% -5%\n\n1m 3m 6m ly 1.5y 2y\nRTY change (RHS) SPX change (RHS) SPX 17-May\n=== SPX 1-Jun RTY 17-May =——_RTY 1-Jun\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.\n\nChart 20: 2017 is already the 5\" calmest year for the VIX with 76 YTD\ncloses below 12.

Daily data from Jan-90 to 5-Jun-17.\n\nThe political turmoil on 17-May caused short-term vols to reset\nhigher and the VIX jumped to 15.59 from 10.65 the prior day.\nShort-term vols in turn moved the back end of the curve higher\nwith e.g. SPX (RTY) 1y vols trading higher by 1.05% (0.79%).\n\nHowever, the agitation in equity markets was short-lived. The\nfront end of the curve collapsed over the subsequent trading\n\nsessions and resulted in a very steep term structure for both\n\nindices, similar to what we have become accustomed to over\nthe prior months.\n\nBy the end of last week, SPX long term vols (1y and beyond) had\nmoved to virtually the same levels where they traded prior to\nthe vol spike. RTY long-term vols, however, remain bid.\n\nWith only five months of the year behind us, the VIX has already\nclosed below 12 on 76 days. Since 1990, only 4 other years\nhave seen a larger number of trading sessions with the VIX\nclosing below 12.\n\nOf the 15 trading sessions in VIX’s history since 1990 when the\nindex closed below 10, 6 were between May-17 and Jun-17. The\nlow short-dated implied vol is in part driven by realized vol; 10d\nis at 4.5%, which is already subdued even for the current low-\nvol regime (17th %-ile since the US election last November).\n\nBankof America\nMerrill Lynch\n\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017 9\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023583",
