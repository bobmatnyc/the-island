As of March 2011,\nChina had the largest number of students in SEVIS, at 158,698.°\n\nThe FBI has access to all of the student data contained in SEVIS, and no longer needs\n\nthe permission of DHS to initiate investigations of foreign students.*° However, the laws,\nregulations, and directives governing SEVIS do not require some additional critical pieces\nof information, which are nonetheless perceived to be important to manage the program.\nAccording to the Government Accounting Office (GAO):\n\ne the nonimmigrant visa number, expiration date, and issuing post are optional and\nonly captured if entered into the system by the school or exchange visitor program;\n\ne the nonimmigrant driver’s license number and issuing state were imposed by the\ninteragency working group and support investigative efforts; and\n\ne the nonimmigrant passport number, passport expiration date, and passport issuing\ncountry are optional and only captured if entered into the system by the school or\nexchange visitor program.”’\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain from open sources whether these problems have been fixed, but\nthe nonmandatory data are key investigative details that would be critical for federal law\nenforcement seeking to assess possible illicit technology transfers by students.\n\nImproved export controls\n\nThe second major policy problem involves PRC student access to controled technology\nunder the deemed export system.
