  "text": "yourself too seriously, and learn to start with a light careful touch when playing with\nsomeone new. Learn to ask for help and guidance, both from others in your S&M\ncommunity and from your partners.”\n\nScootah agreed: \"The first mistake I see newbie doms make is trying too hard to be some\nkind of bad ass. Admit your inexperience. Be seen learning. Be modest and have a good\ntime. Learn to communicate well, and to really be friends with your prospective\npartners.\"\n\nFor me, the bottom line of these conversations is that questioning gender roles, and\nunderstanding gender complications, is an ongoing process. People have a lot of urges\nand preferences that are politically inconvenient and which we will never fully\nunderstand. Whether we're shaped by biology or culture, those feelings will still exist for\nnow, and we have to deal with them. There are ways to do almost anything such that\npeople respect each other, though -- whatever the implications for gender or power.\nViolence is complicated ground, but it can be used in balanced and consensual ways that\nend up bonding people together. Fifty Shades of Grey and Fight Club are both examples,\nand I haven't even touched competitive sports!\n\nTK OK ok\n\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nABUSE:\n[theory] The Alt Sex Anti-Abuse Dream Team\n\nI wrote this post in 2010 for the high-profile feminist blog Feministe. If I were to write it\ntoday, then I would write it differently. In particular, if I were writing it today, then I\nwould emphasize that there are actually two primary patterns for abusive S&M\nperpetrators. There are the ones I emphasized in this post, the ones who prey on\ninexperienced people outside the community... but then there's another category:\nperpetrators who achieve high status within the community and then use it to get away\nwith non-consensual things. Other BDSMers have been writing about this more and\nmore, and the discussion is really heating up right now, in 2012. My fellow feminist\nBDSM writer Thomas MacAulay Millar has a particularly long, complex blog series\nabout patterns of abuse in the BDSM community that gives a lot of great reference links\nto other articles on the same topic. I've mentioned Thomas before; I don't always agree\nwith him, but he's principled and passionate and smart. He blogs at the Yes Means Yes\nblog, and the series is being published post-by-post even as I write this. The first post in\nthe series is available at this link:\n\nhttp://vesmeansyesblog. wordpress.com/2012/03/23/theres-a-war-on-part-1-troubles-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018553",
