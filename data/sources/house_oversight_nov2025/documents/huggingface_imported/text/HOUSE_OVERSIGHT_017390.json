  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nBakker wrote me a long handwritten letter from prison imploring me to join his appellate team\nand save him from a lifetime of imprisonment. There was not enough time before the appellate\nbrief had to be filed for me to take over the entire appeal, but I was particularly appalled by the\nlength of the sentence and the religiously discriminatory reason the judge gave for imposing it. I\nagreed therefore to brief and argue the sentencing issue on the appeal (a team of Texas lawyer\nhad been retained long before to argue against the conviction).\n\nThis is how a New York Times journalist characterized the oral argument:\n\nLast June, barely a week before their brief was due, the Houston lawyers handling Mr.\nBakker's appeal, Don Ervin and Brian Wice, learned that Mr. Dershowitz was joining their\nlegal team. He was to handle only a small part of Mr. Bakker's appeal, concerning the 45-\nyear sentence meted out by Judge Robert D. Potter. Mr. Dershowitz insisted he would\nremain in the background.\n\nBut that, it turned out, was a bit like George Steinbrenner's saying \"Yogi Berra is my\nmanager for the rest of the year.\" In October, when the Bakker appeal was argued, it was\naround Mr. Dershowitz that everyone clustered...\n\nEven his co-counsel, two Texans schooled in a tradition of great oratory, were dazzled by\nwhat they saw in court. \"It was kind of like watching a terrific maestro in front of an\norchestra,\" Mr. Ervin said. Mr. Wice called the performance \"mesmerizing\" and added:\n\"He looks like a schlep, wearing suits he could have bought in Filene's Basement, woolen\nsocks, and shoes -- I don't know if they still call them Earth shoes. But the judges hung on\nevery word he had to say and bought what he was selling.\"\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Wice couldn’t resist noting what he called Mr. Dershowitz’s predilection\nfor publicity. “I’ve discovered that the most dangerous place to be in the criminal justice\nsystem is not the Federal Penitentiary at Marion or the holding cell at the Tombs, but\nbetween Alan Dershowitz and a television camera.”\n\nMr. Dershowitz relished the chance to take on Judge Potter (nicknamed \"Maximum Bob\"\nfor his harsh sentencing), with whom he'd tangled in a previous case. \"This is a judge who\ndoesn't understand the difference between a year and a decade, who always adds a zero to\nthe sentence other judges would impose,\" Mr. Dershowitz said.\n\nJim Bakker did not have such nice things to say about his other lawyers:\n\nAlan Dershowitz did an outstanding job highlighting the errors in my case and in my\nsentencing. That same could not be said, however, of my Texas attorneys’ attempt to\ncontest the merits of the case. Their arguments were confusing and unconvincing. At one\npoint they implied to the judges that I had not intended to defraud the PTL Partners,\nmerely deceive them. “You can intend to deceive but not intend to defraud,” my lawyer\nsaid. “It is not against the law in this context to deceive. Of course, I had intended to do\n\n303\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017390",
