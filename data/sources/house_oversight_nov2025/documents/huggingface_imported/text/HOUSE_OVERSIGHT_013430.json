City Spy hears that busi-\nness-to-business publisher United Business Media is the latest outfit which is thinking of ramping up its subscription\nmodel. Property Week and Building are among the titles which recently started asking users to register their details to\nkeep reading stories, which is seen as a possible precursor to charging.\n\nBUSINESSES TIPPED TO COME A CROPPER\n\nAMID all the contradictory forecasts for recovery or double-dip recession in 2010, what do the insolvency practi-\ntioners say? City Spy's mole in the bean-counting world says the last quarter of 2009 was surprisingly quiet as the\neconomy stabilised but they are not optimistic about the new year: \"We reckon there's going to be a rush of insolvencies\nin the second quarter, after the end of the financial year.\" The next quarterly rent review is due tomorrow, Christmas\nDay, then again at the end of March. But given the number of \"seasonal sales\" that started on the High Street at least a\nweek before Christmas, it would be no surprise to see some retailers come a cropper sooner...\n\nEPSTEIN PILOT TAKES TO THE ROAD\n\nFURTHER news reaches City Spy of former Bear Stearns trader, Prince Andrew's shooting companion and con-\nvicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe ex-Wall Street star served 13 months in jail on criminal charges of soliciting prostitution and procuring a minor\nfor prostitution and he now faces civil claims from young women accusing him of having unlawful sex with them. This\nweek, City Spy recounted how Epstein had transferred the title deeds of his prized 2003 Ferrari 575M Maranello to his\nprivate pilot Larry Visoki, prior to the car going on sale for $159,000 (£99,000) (possibly to help Epstein pay his legal\nbills). It turns out, the same Visoki was deposed last week by Bradley Edwards, an attorney for three of the women su-\ning Epstein. Questioned by Edwards about plane passengers who might have witnessed Epstein in the company of\nyoung girls, Visoki admitted Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, former Colombian\npresident Andrés Pastrana Arango, Obama economic adviser Lawrence Summers, billionaire Ron Burkle, and actors\nKevin Spacey and Chris Tucker had been on board the plane while young girls were present. Fortuitously for Epstein,\nhowever, Ferrari-selling Visoki swore on oath that he never suspected his boss of having sex with them.\n\nOf course not, Larry. Now drive off into the sunset.\n\nMore on Prince Andrew, our special representative for international trade and investment. The European Parliament\nand the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe have strongly condemned Azerbaijan for tightening re-\nstrictions on the media and jailing two bloggers who were critical of the government. It transpires the oil-rich country\nhas long blocked BBC broadcasts there, which might explain why oft-criticised Andrew and former Prime Minister\nTony Blair spend so much time visiting the sometime Soviet State.\n\nWhat does the snow have in common with the recession? Every other country can get out of both but Britain can't\nget out of either. HAPPY news: private jet travel is back, reports the Wall Street Journal. Alas, there is a \"but\" [#x2039]\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013430",
