According to Drumheller, such an\ninternal investigation would not be undertaken lightly or because of\nan “e-mail spat.” He said that such an investigation was “a big deal”\ninvolving the CIA Office of Security in Washington and possibly the\nFBI. It would also result in the temporary suspension of Snowden’s\nsecurity clearance. This left Snowden with little real choice. If he\nwanted to avoid that investigation, he had to resign from the CIA,\nwhich he did in February 2009. That was the end of the security\ninvestigation.\n\nHe was clearly bitter, posting on Ars Technica on January 10,\n2009, “Obama just appointed a fucking POLITICIAN to run the\nCIA!” (He was referring to Leon Panetta, President Clinton’s former\nchief of staff.) Snowden attributed the origins of his antipathy to\nUS. intelligence to his 2007-9 experiences in the CIA. He later told\n\n© Vanity Fair that the 2009 incident in the CIA convinced him that ©\nworking “through the system would lead only to reprisals.”\n\nSnowden, if not yet a ticking time bomb, was certainly a disgrun-\ntled intelligence worker before he ever got to the NSA.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 27 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019515",
