Twenty five years ago, I had a friend with a peculiar way of responding to seeing things he didn’t like on TV: he\nwould throw White Castle hamburgers at the screen. I always thought this was a bad way to waste a good hamburger, but I had\none of those moments the other night when watching news reports on debt ceiling discussions. Media outlets have referred to\nPresident Reagan’s scolding of Congressional Republicans for delaying debt ceiling increases, and the 18 increases that took\nplace during his Presidency. The implication: reservations about raising the debt ceiling are as irresponsible now as they were\nthen. This is a disingenuous argument; in the 1980’s, the debt ceiling being debated was 50% of GDP, and had no\nbearing on the solvency of the United States. Today, the proposed increase raises the debt limit twice as high, measured\nrelative to GDP or government revenues. While a default is a very bad idea (deserving of a White Castle hurling of its own),\nunconstrained debt growth with no plan to slow it is bad as well. Some suggest we not worry about debt growth, since demand\nfrom foreign central banks and the Federal Reserve would keep yields in check. That logic is irresponsible at best. Debt limit\nlegislation is a rocky but healthy way for a democracy to decide whether mega-deficits are in the long-term public interest.\n\nDebtlimitdebate of the 80’s: anentirely different discussion\n\nPercent Multiple\n110% 8x\n100% ve\n90% Reagan scolds Debt limit to\n80% Congressional GDP 6x\nRepublicans for not -_\n10% 5x\n\nraising the debt\n\n60% ceiling AX\n50% =e\nDebt limit to 3x\n\n40% gov. receipts\n30% —> 2x\n20% 1x\n\n1950 1956 1962 1968 1974 1980 1986 1992 1998 2004 2010\nSource: OMB, BEA, J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\n\nOver the last few days, the Gang of Six plan, the Reid-McConnell plan and the Obama-Boehner plan have all been\nraised up the flagpole and then lowered. By the end of the process, we’re still looking for deficit reduction of $3 trillion+\nover 10 years (relative to the CBO Alternative case in which there is no deficit reduction at all). However, Congress is running\nshort on time, and may have to do a smaller debt ceiling increase/deficit reduction first. For now, we wait to see the balance of\nspending cuts and revenue increases’ will be agreed to. Last week’s Profiles in Courage piece walked through the history and\ndynamics of this process, so we won’t repeat that here. Here’s our take on what has been proposed so far, with the caveat\nthat many plans are not crystal clear what baseline they are using’, or what steps they recommend to get to that baseline first.\n\nWhat's on the menu?
