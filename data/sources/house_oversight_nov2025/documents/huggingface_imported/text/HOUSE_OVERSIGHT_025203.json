  "text": "“There was a stage at one end,” Judge Thomas continued his description, “and the stage was facing rows\nand rows of wooden folding chairs. There were haystacks piled up on the stage, and in front of the haystacks\nthere was a beautiful, buxom, blond woman—and a donkey. Well, the woman began disrobing and she started\n\nstroking the donkey to arousal.”\n‘“Doesn’t sound at all sleazy to me,” Senator Simpson said.\n\n“Actually, it had Beethoven piano sonatas playing in the background,” Judge Thomas said. “Well, when\nthe woman was fully disrobed and the donkey was fully aroused, they began copulating, right there in front of\nthose haystacks on the stage of that barn. Slow and sensual. Then bumping and grinding away, accompanied by\npassionate moans and wild braying. You’ve never seen a sight like this, I promise. And then the camera panned\n\nslowly toward the audience . . . and the audience consisted entirely of donkeys.”\n\nThe Senate office shook with raucous laughter, especially that of Judge Thomas. His booming guffaws\nrang like huge gongs in a church belfry. And, I must admit, I had to suppress my own laughter. I had been totally\ncaught by surprise, but I appreciated getting the insight. Homo sapiens is, in reality, the only species that has a\n\nneed for pornography.\n\nWhen the group’s laughter finally began to simmer down, Senator Hatch said, “I suppose that movie was\n\none of the demands of the animal rights people.”\n“That’s correct,” Senator Simpson added. “Saving animals’ lives is no longer enough. They need culture.”\n\nI felt like I was imprisoned in the boys’ locker room, but I was getting ready to force myself to leave\n\nanyway, and it would have ended right there for me if the subject matter hadn’t returned to Anita Hill.\n\n“T’m glad nobody considered calling her to testify against me, even for a closed-door session,” Judge\nThomas said. “But you fellas will really love this. Anita Hill was a very opinionated young lady. Actually, she\nand I once had an extremely animated discussion on the decriminalization of abortion. Can you imagine what\n\nthe Democrats would’ve done with that?”\n\nAnd that was the precise instant I made the decision to leak Professor Hill’s statement to the press. Although\n\nI have constantly been sexually hassled, I have never really been harassed in the /egal sense of the word.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025203",
