  "text": "Page 73 of 78\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *963\n\nto speak at those hearings does not interfere with the defendant's right to be notified of those hearings, attend those hearings,\nand to speak at those hearings. Perhaps this is why the NACDL could only assert that \"in general\" victims’ rights harm\ndefendants - the NACDL did not provide a single supporting example.\n\nMoreover, the procedure that the NACDL would put in place - a full evidentiary hearing with the defendant able to cross-\nexamine the victim to be determine \"victim\" status - is novel and unwarranted. While crime victims’ rights have existed in all\nfifty states and the federal system for the last two decades, no [*964] jurisdiction has ever required anything like this. °°\n\nInstead, procedural issues of how to determine victim status are left to the sound discretion of the trial courts.\n\nTo give a defendant an automatic right to challenge victim status raises constitutional and other problems. A defendant who\nsimply complained about a victim designation would lack \"standing\" under Article III of the Constitution, because there would\nbe no \"threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action.\" *©8 Moreover, to give defendants free license to\ncross-examine victims about whether they were truly victims would obviously create a right to discovery in a criminal case that\n\n569 and circumvents the stringent limitations on depositions of witnesses found in Rule 15. °7° The\n\ncontradicts current law\npotential for abusive questioning of victims in such hearings (where no jury is present to be alienated) should also not be\noverlooked. >’! The victims' rights provisions in this country have never been used to give defendants new rights to question\n\nand potentially traumatize victims. The CVRA's expansion of victims' rights should not be the occasion to start. >”\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nThis Article has tried to make the case for specific changes to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to protect crime\nvictims’ rights, particularly those rights listed in the CVRA. The Article has attempted to sketch out one way that the Rules\ncould be amended to do this while at the same time contending that the Advisory Committee's pending victims' rights proposals\nare too restrictive. In concluding the Article, it may be useful to raise broader concerns about the Advisory Committee's\nminimalist approach.\n\nIn reviewing the Advisory Committee's proposals, some might reach the conclusion that the Committee treated the victims\nissue as a chore to be survived rather than an opportunity to be seized. One can read the Committee's proposals and the minutes\nof its discussions without finding much enthusiasm for the idea of crime victims becoming a part of the criminal justice\nprocess. This reluctance may be part of a larger phenomenon of hostility by the legal culture to crime victims, as other scholars\nand I have argued elsewhere. *74\n\nofficials prosecute, punish and release accused or convicted offenders.\" Tribe & Cassell, supra note 28; accord 8. Rep. 106-254, at 1-2 (2000)\n(Victims' Rights Amendment designed to guarantee victims participatory rights in government process). That is why the CVRA states that the\nrights must be afforded by government agencies and actors. See /8 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (2006).\n\n*67 Communication from Professor Douglas Beloof, Director of the National Crime Victims Law Institute (Jan. 19, 2007) (on file with\nauthor).\n\n%68 Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975) (internal quotation omitted).\n\n569 See supra notes 206-211 and accompanying text.\n\n570 See supra note 210 and accompanying text.\n\n‘71 See Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 1434-37 (explaining how cross-examination of victims at Utah's preliminary\nhearings has traumatized victims).\n\n52 The Advisory Committee ultimately agreed with this position, and added language to a Committee Note stating simply that the court\ncould make findings to resolve any dispute about who was a victim. See infra note 580.\n\n*3 See, e.g., Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 534 (\"The \"legal culture’ ... is one that has not made room for crime victims.\");\nEdna Erez, Victim Participation in Sentencing: And the Debate Goes On ... , 3 Int'l Rev. of Victimology 17, 29 (1994) (noting socialization\nof legal scholars \"in a culture and structure that do not recognize the victim as a legitimate party in criminal proceedings\"); see also Stephanos\nBibas, Transparency and Participation in Criminal Procedure, 8/ N.Y.U.L. Rev. 911, 964 (2006) (suggesting crime victims can effectively\nmonitor the behavior of \"insiders\" in the system).\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017708",
