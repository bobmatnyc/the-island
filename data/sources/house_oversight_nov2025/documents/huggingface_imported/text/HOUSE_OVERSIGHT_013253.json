  "text": "Glossary of Specialized Terms 337\n\nMOSES (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search): An algorithm for proce-\ndure learning, which in the current implementation learns programs in the Combo language.\nMOSES is an evolutionary learning system, which differs from typical genetic programming\nsystems in multiple aspects including: a subtler framework for managing multiple \"demes”\nor “islands” of candidate programs; a library called Reduct for placing programs in Elegant\nNormal Form; and the use of probabilistic modeling in place of, or in addition to, mutation\nand crossover as means of determining which new candidate programs to try.\n\nMotoric: Pertaining to the control of physical actuators, e.g. those connected to a robot.\nMay sometimes be used to refer to the control of movements of a virtual character as well.\nMoving Bubble of Attention: The Attentional Focus of a CogPrime system.\n\nNatural Language Comprehension: See Language Comprehension\n\nNatural Language Generation: See Language Generation\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP): See Language Processing\n\nNLGen: Software for carrying out the surface realization phase of natural language gen-\neration, via translating collections of RelEx output relationships into English sentences.\nWas made functional for simple sentences and some complex sentences; not currently under\nactive development, as work has shifted to the related Atom2Link approach to language\ngeneration.\n\nNode: A type of Atom. Links and Nodes are the two basic kinds of Atoms. Nodes, math-\nematically, can be thought of as \"O-ary\" links. Some types of Nodes refer to external or\nmathematical entities (e.g. WordNode, NumberNode); others are purely abstract, e.g. a\nConceptNode is characterized purely by the Links relating it to other atoms. Grounded-\nPredicateNodes and GroundedSchemaNodes connect to explicitly represented procedures\n(sometimes in the Combo language); ungrounded PredicateNodes and SchemaNodes are\nabstract and, like ConceptNodes, purely characterized by their relationships.\n\nNode Probability: Many PLN inference rules rely on probabilities associated with Nodes.\nNode probabilities are often easiest to interpret in a specific context, e.g. the probability\nP(cat) makes obvious sense in the context of a typical American house, or in the context\nof the center of the sun. Without any contextual specification, P(A) is taken to mean\nthe probability that a randomly chosen occasion of the system’s experience includes some\ninstance of A.\n\nNovamente Cognition Engine (NCE): A proprietary proto-AGI software system, the\npredecessor to OpenCog. Many parts of the NCE were open-sourced to form portions of\nOpenCog, but some NCE code was not included in OpenCog; and now OpenCog includes\nmultiple aspects and plenty of code that was not in NCE.\n\nOpenCog: A software framework intended for development of AGI systems, and also for\nnarrow-AI application using tools that have AGI applications. Co-designed with the Cog-\nPrime cognitive architecture, but not exclusively bound to it.\n\nOpenCog Prime (OCP): The implementation of the CogPrime cognitive architecture\nwithin the OpenCog software framework.\n\nOpenPsi: CogPrime’s architecture for motivation-driven action selection, which is based\non adapting Dorner’s Psi model for use in the OpenCog framework.\n\nOperational Agent Controller (OAC): In some OpenCog configurations, this is a soft-\nware server containing a CogServer devoted to real-time control of an agent (e.g. a virtual\nworld agent, or a robot). Background, offline learning tasks may then be dispatched to other\nsoftware processes, e.g. to a Learning Server.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013253",
