  "text": "Then there is the outside world pressed to the glass, appalled and\ntitillated by the monster inside the big house—a kind of Boo Radley of the\nUpper East Side. I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the\nreaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same:\naudible disbelief (everybody makes their own particular odd noise). Press\naccounts, seldom supplying new information, ever recycle and repeat the\nmysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology, with brief glimpses of\nhim stepping out of the house (the same photos endlessly republished), and\nthe assumption of depravity inside.\n\nIn fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional\ndomestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a\nlife somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nThe domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s\nproblems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support\nstaff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying,\nhaving children, and continuing as part of his business and household\ninfrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently\nmarried, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein\nhad arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend\nis in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a\nSwedish model and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and\nmarried hedge funder Glen Dubin and together they finance the\nDubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will\ntravel with him to his floating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, the\nvast apartment in Paris, the Island in the Caribbean, the house in Palm\nBeach.\n\nThis is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic\nrelationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward or straight-faced\nway. It sometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at\nme, but do you even believe what you see? Or it seems he is just oblivious to\nwhat others are thinking. A willful and perhaps fatal tone deafness.\n\nBut Hefnerian prurience can also be quite businesslike: poised young\nwomen in a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office\nresponsibilities—in some sense not that different from any of the art\ngalleries in the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nEpstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so\nmuch as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves”’), but\noften as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its\nown fetish-like attraction).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022711",
