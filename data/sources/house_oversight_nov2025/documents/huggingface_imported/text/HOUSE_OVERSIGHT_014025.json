  "text": "never had the time to finish my muse—the interview guide. But I was getting tons of requests to do\nconsulting from my readers, so I started with resume editing and expanded into mock interviews— yes,\nnot very “muse-like” but I charged high rates and could make my old salary in a fraction of the time. I\ndid this ALL while staying completely anonymous out of necessity—because I didn’t want to get fired\nwithout an alternative income stream. Amazingly, my services took off even though I couldn’t tell\nanyone who I was.\n\nAt the same time, I decided I would not get another job in finance, and would instead leave in June\n2008. So I had a very short amount of time to make everything work. Almost every single one of my\nfriends, roommates, and family doubted me and said it would never work. I decided they were all wrong\nand I would just do it anyway— worst-case scenario, I could always reduce my expenses and move to\nThailand to teach English.\n\nTo boost my income, I completely revamped my site to sell more of my offerings, which took me\nfrom pocket change to full-time income from part-time consulting over July-August 2008. This allowed\nme to travel to Hawaii and Aruba to go snorkeling, surfing, and shark-cage-diving and visit friends in\nother parts of the U.S. all while making an investment banker’s income from part-time work.\n\nAs the recession and economy worsened, my business picked up because it was counter-cyclical—\nanything that helps people find jobs is in huge demand in a poor economy. I’ve since helped scores of\nlaid-off bankers and other financiers find work elsewhere. However, I was also starting to work a lot\nmore because I was effectively trading time for money ... so over the fall I started to work on my\noriginal product idea—my interview guide—and released it to great success later in 2008.\n\nIt has gone on to free up a ton of time, double my revenues, and put the majority of my income on\nautopilot. If I didn’t do any further work from this point onward, I could make 2—3x my previous\nmonthly income simply by writing once or twice a week for my site (4-5 hours) and doing limited\nconsulting on the side (10 hours). So you could say I’ve increased my income almost 3x while reducing\nmy hours 6x-9x and making myself completely mobile.\n\nI admit that often I do “work” more than this, but it’s all on related educational projects that I want to\nwork on, not anything that I have to work on. And if I don’t feel like working one week, I can reduce my\nhours to the 5-15 hour range and spend my time on learning languages, sports, or traveling to exotic\ndestinations.\n\nThis setup allowed me to take an amazing trip to China, Singapore, Thailand, and Korea in December-\nJanuary and get in some ridiculous adventures. [Il be moving to Asia in a few months and after that,\ntraveling the world indefinitely while running my business from coffee shops.\n\nIncidentally, I met up with a lot of customers in Asia who thought this was the coolest thing ever!\n\nYour book has changed my life and infinitely improved my lifestyle, and I just wanted to thank you\nfor everything.\n\n—B. DECHESARE\n\nWHO SAYS KIDS HOLD YOU BACK?\n\nMy first action was to think “what is the worst that can happen on a scale of 1-10” if I quit my well-\npaid, very secure government job? The power of this thought process is incredible.\n\nI quit my job, sold my house, and went camping for three months with two kids under two and a half\n\nand a pregnant wife (mini-retirement). We (very slowly) drove the SE coast of Australia from Sydney to\nAdelaide.\n\nWith the complete clarity of mind that comes from being in a field with your family with no\nimmediate worries, I put into action a plan that I had been tinkering with for 12 months. I bought a\nwireless Internet dongle and created an info product for electrical engineers, and wrote some software to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014025",
