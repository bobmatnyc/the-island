  "text": "284 15 Emergent Networks of Intelligence\n\nFig. 15.4: Small-scale portrayal of a portion of the spatiotemporal hierarchy in Jeff Hawkins’\nHierarchical Temporal Memory architecture.\n\n15.3.3 Dual Networks\n\nFinally, if both hierarchical and heterarchical structures exist in an Atomspace, then both ECAN\nand PLN will naturally blend them together, because hierarchical and heterarchical links will\nfeed into their link-creation processes and naturally be combined together to form new links.\nThis will tend to produce a structure called a dual network, in which a hierarchy exists, along\nwith a rich network of heterarchical links joining nodes in the hierarchy, with a particular density\nof links between nodes on the same hierarchical level. The dual network structure will emerge\nwithout any explicit engineering oriented toward it, simply via the existence of hierarchical\nand heterarchical networks, and the propensity of ECAN and PLN to be guided by both the\nhierarchical and heterarchical networks. The existence of a natural dual network structure in\nboth linguistic and sensorimotor data will help the formation process along, and then creative\ncognition will enrich the dual network yet further than is directly necessitated by the external\nworld.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013200",
