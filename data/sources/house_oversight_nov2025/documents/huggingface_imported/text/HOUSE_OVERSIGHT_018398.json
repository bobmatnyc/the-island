  "text": "“Computer systems are, like many other things in engineering, constructed by\ncomposition,” computer researchers F.X. Lindner and Sandro Gaycken have written.\nThat line, intended for switched-on digital systems, in fact fits most of our world.\nNearly everything around us, from cities to telephone networks to refugee waves,\nare assembled by composition. Curriences are layered with encryption. Refugee\ndreams carved from photosharing and refined with GPS. Composition in this way\nbreeds new vulnerabilities, new points of contact and this rather astonishing result,\none we're not prepared for in any sense: “In a composite system there is no critical\ngate,” Lindner and Gaycken explain. “Everything is a gate.”299\n\n239 “Everything is a gate”: Lidner and Gaycken, p. 56\n166\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018398",
