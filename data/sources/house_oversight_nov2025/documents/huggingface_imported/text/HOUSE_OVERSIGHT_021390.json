  "text": "instances of disease; they treat patients\nas less than the human persons they are.\n\nPhysicians, it would seem, are\nsubject to a particular form of the more\ngeneral psychological challenge of\npaying attention to other minds. Like all\nhumans, physicians easily ignore the\nmindfulness of others. This matters,\nEpley reminds us, “because mindful\nagents become moral agents worthy of\ncare and compassion.” As such, patients\nwho are seen as mindful “evoke empathy\nand concern for well-being, whereas\nagents without mindful experience can\nbe treated simply as mindless objects.”\nThere are obstacles to recognizing the\nmindfulness of patients. Illness makes a\npatient different, or deviant, from human\nnorms, and we tend to pay less attention\nto the minds of those who are different\nfrom ourselves. In addition,\n“Considering other minds requires some\nattentional effort. It does not come\nautomatically.” Physicians learn to go\nthrough the technical motions of caring\nfor the sick until those motions become\n‘automatic’—that is the mark of a skilled\nand effective clinician. But paying\nattention to the mindfulness of patients\nrequires a sustained investment of time\nand energy that physicians are often\nunwilling to make.\n\nHow could religious practices\nhelp? As Luhrmann notes, most people\nfind it very difficult to pay attention to\nGod. To help in this difficult and\nlifelong task, many religions have\ndeveloped disciplines of prayer and\nother practices that call to mind what we\ntend to forget—including the ideas that\nmotivate genuine human concern for\nthose who suffer. Christians, for\nexample, practice remembering that all\npeople are ultimately united as children\nof the one creator God, that “the ground\nis level at the foot of the cross”\n\n144\n\nPage\n\nregardless of one’s social status, one’s\nbiological fitness or one’s reproductive\ncapacity. Epley notes that we are better\nable to pay attention to what another is\nthinking or feeling when we are\nmotivated to do so. Christianity seeks to\nstimulate such motivation by\nencouraging Christians to meditate on\nthe fact that Jesus comes to us in those\nwho are sick and otherwise suffer’.\nMoreover, it reminds us that we are\nnever alone. As Katherine Tanner\ndetails in her chapter, God is always\nwith us. This central theological claim,\nwhen remembered in song, prayer,\nliturgy, reading of Scriptures and other\nrituals, provides a particular form of\nwhat psychologists call “mindful\nsurveillance”—our actions become more\n“prosocial” (even altruistic) when we are\naware of being observed by others. All\nof these practices depend on and extend\nthe capacities of the social brain. They\nare also, from the vantage of\nChristianity, ways in which one may\ncome to receive grace, the unmerited\nhelp of God.\n\nReligious practices have\ntherefore at least the potential to\nencourage and strengthen the human\ncapacity for attending to the\nmindfulness, and therefore the\npersonhood, of those who are sick and\ndiminished. As Epley suggests, “Making\nminds visible, and hence more like one’s\nown, enables people to more readily\nfollow the most famous of all ethical\ndictates—to treat others as you would\nhave others treat you.”\n\nConclusion\n\nScience and religion are invisibly\nand inextricably intertwined in the\npractice of medicine. Science has\nprovided modern medicine with\nextraordinary diagnostic and therapeutic\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021390",
