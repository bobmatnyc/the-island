  "text": "At the same time, however, these numbers don’t lie. With our demographics and our\ndebts, we’re on a collision course with the future. The good news: Although time is\ngrowing short, we still have the capacity to create positive outcomes.\n\nEven though USA Inc. can print money and raise taxes, USA Inc. cannot sustain its financial\nimbalance indefinitely — especially as the Baby Boomer generation nears retirement age. Net\ndebt levels are approaching warning levels, and some polls suggest that Americans consider\nreducing debt a national priority. Change is legally possible. Unlike underfunded pension\nliabilities that can bankrupt companies, USA Inc.’s underfunded liabilities are not legal contracts.\nCongress has the authority to change the level and conditions for Social Security and Medicare\nbenefits; the federal government, together with the states, can also alter eligibility and benefit\nlevels for Medicaid.\n\nOptions for entitlement reform, operating efficiency, and stronger long-term GDP growth.\n\nAs analysts, not public policy experts, we can offer mathematical illustrations as a framework for\ndiscussion (not necessarily as actual solutions). We also present policy options from third-party\norganizations such as the CBO.\n\nReforming entitlement programs — Social Security.\n\nThe underfunding could be addressed through some or all of the following mechanical changes:\nincreasing the full retirement age to as high as 73 (from the current level of 67); and/or reducing\naverage annual social security benefits by up to 12% (from $13,010 to $11,489); and/or\nincreasing the social security tax rate from 12.4% to 14.2%. Options proposed by the CBO\ninclude similar measures, as well as adjustments to initial benefits and index levels. Of course,\nthe low personal savings rates of average Americans — 3% of disposable income, compared with\na 10% average from 1965 to 1985 — limit flexibility, at least in the early years of any reform.\n\nReforming entitlement programs — Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nMathematical illustrations for these programs, the most underfunded, seem draconian: Reducing\naverage Medicare benefits by 53%, to $5,588 per year, or increasing the Medicare tax rate by\n3.9 percentage points, to 6.8%, or some combination of these changes would address the\nunderfunding of Medicare. As for Medicaid, the lack of a dedicated funding stream (i.e., a tax\nsimilar to the Medicare payroll tax) makes the math even more difficult. But by one measure\nfrom the Kaiser Family Foundation, 60% of the Medicaid budget in 2001 was spent on so-called\noptional recipients (such as mid- to low-income population above poverty level) or on optional\nservices (such as dental services and prescription drug benefits). Reducing or controlling these\nbenefits could help control Medicaid spending — but increase the burden on some poor and\ndisabled groups.\n\nUltimately, the primary issue facing the US healthcare system is ever-rising costs, historically\ndriven by increases in price and utilization. Beneath sustained medical cost inflation is an\nentitlement mentality bolted onto a volume-based reimbursement scheme. All else being equal,\nthe outcome is an incentive to spend: Underlying societal, financial, and liability factors combine\nto fuel an inefficient, expensive healthcare system.\n\nB\nGB www.kpcb.com USA Inc.
