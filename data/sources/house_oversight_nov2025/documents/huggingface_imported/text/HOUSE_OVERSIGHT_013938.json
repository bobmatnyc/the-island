  "text": "my muse sites and think it’s great! Also, Facebook groups has (almost) every niche imaginable. So what\nI have found success in doing is: (1) Finding a niche group that would buy my muse, (2) sending a\nmessage to each admin telling them how my muse will help their group members. Then politely asking\nthem to put a blurb in the “Recent News” section of the group. This makes it more trustworthy than a\nwall post, and it stays up there (free advertising) until the admin removes it. One hundred times better\nthan a wall post. In one case, the admin purchased my muse, posted my note for me on the groups’\n“Recent News” section, then e-mailed the entire group telling them they have to check out my site.\n\n—GAVIN\n\n50.
