  "text": "to directly talk to him about what happened, because -- even though we never talked\ndirectly about it -- I saw evidence that he felt terrible about it, and I was sure that I could\ndevastate him by talking about it more. But still... I should have talked to him.\n\nI also feel as though I should have supported her more, but I don't know what I could\nhave said. There were people who told her that she shouldn't be having a consensual\nrelationship with her rapist. It seemed wrong to tell her that -- I felt like it eroded her\nagency, attacked her right to choose -- so I didn't say it. If I had said it, though, would\nthat have been helpful to her? What could I have done to be a better resource for her?\nEspecially given that I was such close friends with him?\n\nI was young(er), but that's no excuse. Then again, what am I excusing? I did nothing. But\nI should have done more.\n\nNow, again, I have a friend, a good friend, who assaulted someone. It's a friend in the\nlocal S&M community. I don't know the survivor at all. I have to talk to my friend about\nit, but what do I say, and what happens next? Feminism instructs us that we should listen\nto the voices of survivors, that community mores and community condemnation are what\nstops rape from happening. I believe these things to be true; and there are people close to\nme who have survived rape, and I really want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to\nensure that rape stops happening. But I intensely wish that I had more guidance on what\nexactly to say, how exactly to act, to change the mores.\n\nI emailed my ex-boyfriend Mr. Chastity for advice, because he's got one of the finest\nethical minds I've ever been lucky enough to engage with. Here's part of what he wrote\nback:\n\nI've tried to distill your messages into a few questions, and I ended up with \"How does\none parse a situation in which a friend, and an otherwise noble person, seems to have\ndone serious wrong?” and \"What are a person's moral obligations in this case?\"\n\nNobody is composed of unmixed goodness or evil, no matter how much of a\nparagon/fiend I) they seem to be or 2) their principles require. People we respect and\nlove are not forces of nature or avatars of their cause of choice, no matter how\nthoroughly they embody it to us. I don't say this because I think you haven't considered it,\nbut because I know I've had a lot of trouble absorbing it over the years and think it might\ntherefore bear restating to others, too.\n\nAs an individual, a person has a relatively large degree of freedom in action and\nassociation. I think where this case becomes truly difficult to consider is when we bring\nin justice and the community. Because the means of enforcement of the rules of these\ncommunities is so interpersonal, one's interpersonal actions take on an unusual role of\ncommunity-level justice as well as merely justice between two people. I can't see how it\ncould ever be good to allow things like this to just slide. Honestly, I'm not sure what else\nyou can do but (as you suggest in one of your messages) politely ask your friend about\ntheir take on the story. If nothing else, it will demonstrate that people are paying\nattention to this thing and might give you some insight into their character and opinions\nof the issue.\n\nHe's right. I agree. But. What now? How do I ask, what do I say? How can I tell if my\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018570",
