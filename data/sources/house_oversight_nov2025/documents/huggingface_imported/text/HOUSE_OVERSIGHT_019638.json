The point is to assure that any alternative that\nfits the relevant facts, no matter how implausible it may initially\nseem to be, is not neglected.\n\nOne of the most vexing problems that had to be explained by these\nscenarios is how Snowden got the passwords to up to twenty-four of\nthese vaults. He could not have obtained these passwords during his\nprevious employment at Dell, because Dell technicians did not have\naccess to the Level 3 documents stored in these compartments. Nor,\nas noted earlier, was he given access to them when he transferred to\nBooz Allen, because he had not completed the requisite training.\n\nSnowden had also, it will be recalled, relinquished his privileges as\na system administrator when he transferred to Booz Allen, so he did\nnot have the privilege to override password protection. In short, his\nnew position as an infrastructure analyst did not give him the ability\nto enter compartments that he had not yet been read into.\n\nAs I've said, there are two possible ways he could have gotten\nthese passwords: either he had assistance from a party who had\naccess to them, or he found flaws in the NSA’s security procedures\n\n© that left the supposedly closed vaults effectively unlocked. ®\n\nThe Unwitting Accomplice Possibility\n\nIt is possible that if Snowden received assistance, it was entirely\nunwitting. He might have obtained some passwords through decep-\ntion, such as tricking co-workers into typing their passwords into\na device that captured them. As the NSA informed Congress in\n2014, three of his fellow workers told the FBI that Snowden might\nhave deceived them to gain access to their passwords. He could have\nsimply asked other analysts at the center who had been read into\ncompartments for their passwords. Such an approach would be\nextremely risky for the analyst, who could lose his job and security\nclearance by cooperating. It could also be risky for Snowden because\nany analyst he approached was supposed to report any request for\na password to a security officer. Making such requests even more\nsuspicious, Snowden had been working at the Threat Operations\nCenter for just a few weeks as a trainee and was not well known to\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 150 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019638",
