  "text": "19\n\nroom at the Mira hotel from June 3 to June 9\", 2013, as the event was actually unfolding.\nSnowden, speaking for the camera, describes himself as a civilian contractor for the National\nSecurity Agency. He took full responsibility for the theft of classified documents, saying that he\nhad acted alone. He said that he had been forced to take these documents to expose a crime that\nthreatened the freedom of Americans: the US government’s illegal surveillance of US citizens.\nHe said that he had a duty to bring this secret activity to the attention of the American people.\n“Sitting on his unmade bed—white sheets and covers, white headboard, white bathrobe, white\nskin—Snowden seems like a figure in some obscure ritual, being readied for sacrifice,” George\nPacker wrote about the film in a widely-read article in The New Yorker. He said repeatedly he\nwas willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, by allowing himself to go to prison, so that Americans\ncould live in freedom. A large part of the public, who viewed this powerful film, including many\nof my colleagues in journalism whose writing I greatly respect, came to accept Snowden’s whistle-\nblowing narrative.\n\nThis powerful narrative, as lucidly articulated by Poitras, Greenwald and other Snowden\nsupporters, described the NSA activities exposed by Snowden as part of a vast criminal\nconspiracy involving, among others, President Obama, James Clapper, the Director of National\nIntelligence and both Democrat and Republican members of the Congressional oversight\ncommittees. It further derided claims that there was evidence that Snowden’s theft of NSA\nsecrets went beyond exposing government misdeeds as part of an orchestrated effort to demonize\nSnowden. The purpose of this demonization was to divert away from the government’s crimes.\nFor example, this narrative asserted as if it was established fact, that US government officials had\ndeliberately “trapped” Snowden in Russia. According to Snowden, the purpose of this\ngovernment ploy was to “demonize” him.\n\nTo be sure, it is not unprecedented for the government to release defamatory information\nabout individuals who have embarrassed US intelligence by defecting. When two NSA analysts,\nWilliam Martin and Bernon Mitchell, defected to Russia in the 1960s and accused the NSA of\nviolating international law after arriving in Moscow, U.S. government officials responded by\nputting out the story that they were homosexual lovers, which was both untrue and irrelevant to\nthe intelligence secrets that they compromised. So it is certainly possible that the government put\nout information to intentionally defame Snowden. Secretary of State John Kerry, after all,\ncharacterized him as a coward who should “man up” by returning to the United States.\n\nWhile one can discount such characterizations against him by government officials as\ndemonization, as I do, one cannot as easily dismiss the independent evidence that undermines\nSnowden assertion that his sole motive was blowing the whistle on illicit surveillance in the\nUnited States. For example, by the Lawfare Institute in cooperation with The Brookings\nInstitution in 2014 did an independent analysis of all the published documents that Snowden\nprovided to the media. It concluded that, with some notable exceptions, such as the two\ndocuments initially published by the Guardian and Washington Post, the now famous FISA\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020171",
