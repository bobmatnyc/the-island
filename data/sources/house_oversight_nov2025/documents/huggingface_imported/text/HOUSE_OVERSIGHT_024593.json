Six months after a civil uprising began in Libya,\nCol. Muammar Qadhafi, the nation's longtime leader, finally seems to\nhave lost his grip on the country he ruled for more than 40 years. Did\nhe also, at some point, lose his grip on reality? As the conflict spread\nacross Libya, Qadhafi made a number of bizarre statements to\nmembers of the media, denying that demonstrators were angry with\nthe government and even claiming that any conflict that might be\nunfolding was the result of drinks spiked with hallucinogenic drugs.\nMore recently he has pledged to defend the capital, Tripoli, even as\nrebel forces swept through the city with surprising swiftness. Was\nQadhafi deluded about the state of his nation or was he simply\nunwilling to accept that his time had come? To get some insight on\nthe Libyan leader and other out-of-touch dictators, we spoke to\nJerrold Post, a professor of psychiatry, political psychology and\ninternational affairs, and director of the Political Psychology Program\nat George Washington University. Post is a CIA veteran who has\nwritten psychological profiles of a number of world leaders.\n\nWhat is it about leaders like Qadhafi that makes them unable to\nsee or accept their own impending downfall?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024593",
