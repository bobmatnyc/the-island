If Snowden had released only these two documents that\nrelated to unwarranted domestic surveillance and other possible vio-\nlations of the law by the NSA, it would be difficult for any reasonable\nperson not to see his actions as a potentially valuable public service.\nIndeed, additional safeguards were necessary in an age in which new\ntechnologies enabled mass surveillance of the public. As the three-\njudge panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would later\nfind, Congress had not intended Section 215 of the Patriot Act to\nbe used to justify the bulk collection of American records. If he had\nlimited his illegal downloading to the few documents about bulk col-\nlection, it would be more difficult to argue that he was not a whistle-\nblower in the spirit if not the letter of the law, and even a hero in\nthe struggle to preserve our civil liberties.

The journalists who assisted him, Green-\nwald, Poitras, and Gellman, have been celebrated for the roles they\nplayed in bringing Snowden’s revelations to the public and received\nthe 2014 Polk Award for national security reporting. The Post and\nThe Guardian, the newspapers that initially published the purloined\ndocuments, won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for public service.\n\nIn other circles, the reaction has been very different. American\nand British intelligence officials, senior members of the Obama\nadministration, and members of the oversight committees of Con-\ngress do not view Snowden as a hero or even an authentic whistle-\nblower. Instead, they see him as a betrayer of secrets who willfully\nbrought damage to the United States and benefits to its adversar-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 125 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019613",
