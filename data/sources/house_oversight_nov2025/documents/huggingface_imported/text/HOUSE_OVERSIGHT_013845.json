  "text": "2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law).\n\nThe best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income\nand schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.\n\nIf you haven’t identified the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their\ncompletion, the unimportant becomes the important. Even if you know what’s critical, without deadlines\nthat create focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in the case of the entrepreneur) will swell\nto consume time until another bit of minutiae jumps in to replace it, leaving you at the end of the day\nwith nothing accomplished. How else could dropping off a package at UPS, setting a few appointments,\nand checking e-mail consume an entire 9-5 day? Don’t feel bad. I spent months jumping from one\ninterruption to the next, feeling run by my business instead of the other way around.\n\nTHE 80/20 PRINCIPLE and Parkinson’s Law are the two comerstone concepts that will be revisited in\ndifferent forms throughout this entire section. Most inputs are useless and time is wasted in proportion to\nthe amount that is available.\n\nFat-free performance and time freedom begins with limiting intake overload. In the next chapter, we’ll\nput you on the real breakfast of champions: the Low-Information Diet.\n\nA Dozen Cupcakes and One Question\n\nLove of bustle is not industry.\n—SENECA\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA.\n\n“S\naturdays are my days off,” I offered to the crowd of strangers staring at me, friends of a friend. It\n\nwas true. Can you eat All-Bran and chicken seven days a week? Me neither. Don’t be so judgmental.\n\nBetween my tenth and twelfth cupcakes, I plopped down on the couch to revel in the sugar high until\nthe clock struck midnight and sent me back to my adultsville Sunday—Friday diet. There was another\nparty guest seated next to me on a chair, nursing a glass of wine, not his twelfth but certainly not his first,\nand we struck up a conversation. As usual, I had to struggle to answer “What do you do?” and, as usual,\nmy answer left someone to wonder whether I was a pathological liar or a criminal.\n\nHow was it possible to spend so little time on income generation? It’s a good question. It’s THE\nquestion.\n\nIn almost all respects, Charney had it all. He was happily married with a two-year-old son and another\ndue to arrive in three months. He was a successful technology salesman, and though he wanted to earn\n$500,000 more per year as all do, his finances were solid.\n\nHe also asked good questions. I had just returned from another trip overseas and was planning a new\nadventure to Japan. He drilled me for two hours with a refrain: How is it possible to spend so little time\non income generation?\n\n“If you’re interested, we can make you a case study and I'll show you how,” I offered.\nCharney was in. The one thing he didn’t have was time.\n\nOne e-mail and five weeks of practice later, Charney had good news: He had accomplished more in\nthe last week than he had in the previous four combined. He did so while taking Monday and Friday off\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013845",
