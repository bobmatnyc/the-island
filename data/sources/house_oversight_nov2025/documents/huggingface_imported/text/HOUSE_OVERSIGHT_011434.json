McCAWLEY: Your Honor, I do not believe they'r\n\nbeing offered for the truth because what we're saying -- we're\nnot saying whether or not what those victims said was\nnecessarily true. We're saying was she aware that there were a\n\nnumber -- and they take issue with the number. I don't see a\n\ndifference between 17 and 30. But was she aware that there\n\nwere a number of other individuals making reports at the time\nshe said my client must have been lying about being abused as a\nminor. So whether or not those are true or not, the reports,\n\nwas she aware that there were a number of reports out there\n\nfrom other little girls saying that they were also brought to\n\nthe massage room. And that goes to her state of mind at the\n\ntime she made that statement where she defames my client\n\ninternationally.\n\nTHE COURT: Yes. But aware of the reports. How could\n\nshe be aware of the reports? Aware of the girls and the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011434",
