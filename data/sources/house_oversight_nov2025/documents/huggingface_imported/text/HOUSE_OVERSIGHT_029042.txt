Donald Trump’s newly named chief strategist and senior counselor, Steve Bannon, laid
out his global nationalist vision in unusually in-depth remarks delivered by Skype to a
conference held inside the Vatican in the summer of 2014.

Well before victories for Brexit and Trump seemed possible, Bannon declared there was

“crisis of capitalism” after losing its “Judeo-Christian foundation,” and he blasted “crony

was ousted from a senior Vatican position in 2014, 1s chair of the group’s advisory
board.
