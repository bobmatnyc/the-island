  "text": "decide the religion of his state. The treaties that settled this debate in 1648 - after\nthe most devastating wars in European history at that time - established Cuius regio,\nelus religio as the governing principle. Whose realm, whose religion. The very notion\nof a “state” is itself being eroded as topologies, migrations, and superfast data links\neat at old borders. But nations remain an essential container of power. A rapid\ncollapse of that system would be a disaster, and is frankly unlikely. To be American.\nFrench. Chinese. This still matters.\n\nDo we demand that other nations use our protocols? Do we force China or Germany\nto rules of transparency, data tracking of their citizens and research that we obey?\nNo. Cuius reticulum, eius reticulum. Whose realm, whose network. But, at the same\ntime, should we permit China or Germany to force another nation into its trading\nregime? It’s biological or cyber networks? To the question, “What would America\nfight against in a gatekept world?” one answer is this: We would resist any attempt\nto force-fit a nation to a gated order. We should prepare for difficult, expensive\nfights to maintain this principle. Russia watching neighboring states seduced into a\nChinese trading order or an American technological system won’t bubble with silent\nacquiescence. Arrangements that tilt trade to one side of the Pacific will unnerve\nChina or Japan - or the US. But, in the end, the control logic of cuius reticulum buffers\nus, as a sort of law, against a wilder madness of collapsed nations.\n\nFifth, we should not permit the emergence of any means to destroy our system. The\nvery efficiency of connected architectures makes them vulnerable. Networks, by\ndesign, have holes that particular modes of attack can exploit. Contagion. Strikes\nagainst central nodes.?49 Arms racing of a certain type. Our first attempt to limit risk\nshould be defensive. Better gates. But we'd be foolish to stop there. Gates, the\nTrojans would remind us, are not enough. When truly existential dangers emerge -\nnuclear weapons, certain types of artificial intelligence or genetic engineering - then\nwe must attack. Hard Gatekeeping should include a coiled, prepared readiness to\nstrike with the same light-speed movement that defines the dangers we fear. Of\ncourse we should try to deter such attacks. But we should be realistic. There’s much\nwe can’t deter. And the cost of attack is awfully cheap. We won't be truly safe\nwithout battle plans and diplomatic gambits that can hammer at the topological and\nreal world vulnerabilities of our enemies. After all, they will be hammering on ours.\n\nOur defense task is simple to say, hard to achieve: From the largest symmetrical\nsuperpower in history, America needs to become the greatest asymmetrical one -\ncapable of devastating, instant action anywhere in the real or topological world.\nNetwork scientists who study the power of “centrality” have shown the way that\ncertain positions in a topology - think of a rainforest, a travel network or a stock\nexchange - wield unusual influence. Centrality of a certain node in linked systems\ncan determine control, it can produce “super spreaders” which instantly shape\n\n249 Strikes against: I.A. Kovacs, A-L.
