  "text": "PROPOSAL: Poetry in America for Middle and High School Teachers\n\nA. NATURE OF THE REQUEST\n\nPoetry in America, a collaboration between Elisa New and Programs in Professional\nEducation (PPE) at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), will produce courses\nfor national and international distribution to K-12 teachers. Drawing on Elisa New’s extensive\narchive of raw instructional video, HGSE has the goal of providing online graduate-level\nprofessional development courses for teachers who have never before had the opportunity to\nadvance their careers online. Teachers will be able to use to this course to strengthen their\nclassroom practice while accumulating credits toward advanced degrees in education.\nThough American teachers are required to take professional development courses, very few\nof these courses offer teachers content support. This initiative will provide such support at a\nhigh level, offering Harvard credits and career advancement to participating teachers.\n\nAdditionally, this initiative will produce classroom-ready video content designed to engage and\neducate middle and high school students, thus enabling teachers to bring the content of their\nprofessional development directly into the classroom. It will give teachers the confidence and\ntools to discuss poetry while also meeting Englisn Language Arts standards and providing\nteachers with professional development opportunities. The first such course, Poetry of the\nCity, is already in active development, with its first one-credit module, on the poetry of Walt\nWhitman, currently entering the post-production stage. Tne second proposed course (either\n“The Poetry of Character Development and the Feelings” --concerned with building literacy\nskills and character awareness-- or “The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky” --concerned with\nmaking connections between science and poetry) will enter post-production as soon as funds\nbecome available.\n\nIn addition to the production team (including an executive director, video editor, media\nmanager, and instructional designer), we are joined by a diverse set of senior partners\nincluding:\n\nJames Ryan, Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education\nMary Grassa O’Neill, Managing Director of HGSE Professional Education and former\nsuperintendent of the Archdiocese of Boston and Milton Public Schools\n\ne Roland Fryer, Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard, Macarthur “Genius,”\nand founder of the Education Innovation Laboratory\n\ne Robert Polito, American academic, critic, poet, and President of The Poetry\nFoundation.\n\nOur advisory board includes:\n\ne US Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky\ne Actor John Lithgow\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023435",
