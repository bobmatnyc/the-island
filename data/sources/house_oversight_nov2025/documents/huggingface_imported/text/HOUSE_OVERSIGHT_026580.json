Microsoft \nOffice could go for a quarter. A song might cost a penny. And it could all be perfectly legal under \ninternational law. \nAs part of a long-running trade dispute, the tiny island nation of Antigua and Barbuda (population: \n90,000) won the right to use the intellectual property of U.S. firms — without having to pay any \nroyalties or licensing fees. \nAt a meeting in Geneva today, the country got the final go ahead from the World Trade Organization. \nThe fight goes back to the 1990s, when a bunch of online casinos set up shop in Antigua. After \nthe U.S. cracked down on the casinos, Antigua complained to the WTO, arguing that the U.S.  \nwas unfairly protecting its domestic casinos in violation of free trade rules.  \nAntigua won the case. Typically, when a country wins a case at the WTO, it wins the right to, say, put \na tariff on goods from the losing country. But Antigua is so small that tariffs wouldn't have any \nnoticeable effect on the U.S. economy. \nSo Antigua took another route: It asked the WTO to recover damages in the form of intellectual \nproperty, and the WTO said yes. If this seems likely to cause harm to innocents who had nothing to do \nwith the fight over online casinos, that's the whole point. \n\"It's so Bill Gates might ring up Obama and say, 'Why have I lost my copyright so you can protect \ngaming?\" Mark Mendel, the lawyer representing Antigua told me. (By \"gaming,\" Mendel means the \nU.S. casino business.) \nTo be clear, the Bill Gates reference was hypothetical. Antigua has not yet said what it plans to sell or \nhow it plans to sell it. And whatever it sells, it's not going to be able to sell all that much of it. The WTO \nsaid Antigua can collect only about $21 million a year in damages. \nIn fact, Mendel says, Antigua really doesn't want to do this at all. What it wants is to cut some kind of \ndeal directly with the U.S. that would revive the country's online gambling industry, or help create \nsome other industry in its place. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026580 \n\"Antigua is still a very limited economy,\" Mendel said. \nAs recently as Friday, the U.S. and Antigua were still talking about settlement options, Nkenge \nHarmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. government, told me in an email. And, she wrote: \n...if Antigua does proceed with the unprecedented plan for its government to authorize the theft \nof intellectual property, it would only serve to hurt Antigua's own interests. Government-\nauthorized piracy would undermine chances for a settlement. It also would serve as a major \nimpediment to foreign investment in the Antiguan economy, particularly in high-tech industries. \nWith warm regards, \nCecile \nDISCLAIMER: The information contained in this e-mail may be privileged,confidential, and protected from disclosure.
