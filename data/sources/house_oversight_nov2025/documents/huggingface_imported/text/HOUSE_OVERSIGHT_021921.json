I mentioned that there had been\nthree efforts to get information from Mr. Dershowitz by\nway of a 2009 deposition request, a 2011 deposition\nrequest, and further follow-up correspondence from\ncounsel on that, and a 2013 document request all\npropounded to Mr. Dershowitz that had not gone answered.\n\nAnd this was -- yeah, I'm sorry this slipped\nmy mind at the time -- but when we saw Mr. Dershowitz\nnot responding to these answers, you know, maybe the\nmail didn't get delivered to him or something like that.\nI suppose that's, you know, a theoretical possibility.\n\nBut the reason I ruled out that possibility,\nfirst, it didn't seem likely; but secondly, there was a\npattern of Mr. Epstein's associates evading efforts to\nget information from them. And so let me just go back\nto the earliest instance of that.\n\nAccording to the Chief of Police in the Palm\nBeach -- of the Palm Beach Police Department,\nMr. Dershowitz had said that he would make available\nMr. Epstein for questions about the sex, you know, abuse\nthat was going on. And, you know, Mr. Dershowitz had\nsaid to the Palm Beach Police Department, yeah, we will\nmake him available, no, we got to reschedule it, you\n\nknow, another time reschedule, another time.
