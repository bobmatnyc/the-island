Snowden had been hired to work there as an\noutside contractor by Booz Allen Hamilton, a private company owned by a hedge fund, which\nmanaged much of the information technology at the Center.\n\nGeneral Alexander, returning to Washington DC after assigning the sensitive job of\ninvestigating the breach to Richard “Rick” Ledgett, the Director of the NSA’s Threat Operations\nCenter at NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. It was a key position since the top-\nsecret unit was responsible for discovering and countering the threats posed by Chinese, Russian\nand other adversary nations. Ledgett was also the logical choice to head the damage assessment\ninvestigation since the Center’s regional branch in Hawaii was from where highly-sensitive\ndocuments were stolen and where the main suspect, Snowden, last worked. Ledgett\nimmediately boarded a military jet bound for Hawaii. His first task was to reconstruct the\nchronology all of Snowden’s moves at the Center, or, as the tactic is called in counterintelligence\nparlance, “walking the cat back.”\n\nThe NSA meanwhile notified the FBI of Snowden’s possible involvement in the theft of state\nsecrets. It is in charge of criminal investigations of civilian US intelligence workers, even if they\noccur on a NSA base, The FBI immediately dispatched a top task force of agents to investigate a\npotential espionage case in Hawaii. When questioned, Lindsay Mills, who shared Snowden’s\nrental home with him and had been his girl friend for 8 years, said Snowden was away on a\nbusiness trip. After determining from airline and hotel data that he was in Hong Kong, the FBI\nrealized Snowden was a possible intelligence defector. It froze his credit and bank cards. It also\nnotified the passport office in the State Department the legal attaches at the Hong Kong\nconsulate. The legal attaches, who were actually FBI field agents posted in Hong Kong, located\nSnowden at the Mira Hotel on June 8\". Such international detective work proved unnecessary\nsince on the evening of June 10\" Snowden ended all doubts about the identity of the perpetrator\nby revealing in a 12-minute video posted on the Guardian website that he was the source of the\nstolen NSA documents for which the FBI was searching. The problem was that since Hong Kong\nwas in China, US law enforcement did not have the means to recover them.\n\nAt that point, determining the magnitude of the theft of documents became a critical concern\nof the investigation. Aside from the few dozen documents published by the Guardian and\nWashington Post, what else had Snowden stolen?\n\nWithin the next few days, a small army of forensic investigators from the FBI, the Defense\nDepartment and the “Q” counterintelligence division of the NSA swarmed onto the NSA base in\nHawaii. The proximate crime scene for their investigation was the National Threat Operations\nCenter. They examined the cubicle where Snowden had last worked at NSA, and then began\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020185",
