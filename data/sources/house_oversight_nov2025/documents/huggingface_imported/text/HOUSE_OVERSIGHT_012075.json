They created risk com-\nmittees at the board level and\nimplemented company-wide risk\nmanagement programs. For ex-\nample, we saw how a leading bank\nin the U.S. also established a new\nposition of Chief Risk Officer\nreporting to the board and tasked\nwith ensuring that incentive pro-\ngrams in the organization do not\nencourage excessive or unneces-\nsary risk-taking.”\n\nOne of the largest banks also\nshowed corporate leadership by\npublicly acknowledging responsi-\nbility for unethical practices and\nrecognizing past mistakes.” They\nshifted their focus to identify\nand monitor “material risk-tak-\ning” in their organization and\nincreased managerial oversight.\nOther banks publicly committed\nto seeking responsible business\ngrowth and to conduct their busi-\nness in a more transparent way.”\n\nACTIVE STEWARDSHIP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\n4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012075",
