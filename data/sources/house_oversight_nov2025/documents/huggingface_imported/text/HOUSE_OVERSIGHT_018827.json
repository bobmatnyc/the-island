These projects include the 153-room, proposed Embassy Suites in the\nmahogany Run area, and the 300-room, proposed Hyatt Regency in Mandal Bay. In addition, a hotel\nproject was recently announced on Water Island; however, the developers have not yet announced a\nbrand or number of proposed rooms.\n\nHousing / Property\n\nAs the supply of housing has increased in the last two decades, homeownership rates have also\nincreased, although only slightly. Rates increased 1.9 percentage points between 2000 and 2010, and\nincreased an additional 3.8 percentage points from 2010 to 2012. Average home prices dropped by\n11.8 percent in 2008, but then increased in 2009 and 2010 by 4 percent and 12.3 percent,\nrespectively. In 2012, average home prices fell 17.4% and then rebounded in 2013 with an increase of\n22.1%. The average sales price in 2013 was $538,369. Presumably, much of the increased supply of\nnew homes and condominiums has gone to non-residents and vacationers. Over the past decade,\nhousing costs have accelerated at a far greater pace than resident incomes, putting home ownership\nbeyond the reach of all but a few relatively wealthy islanders.\n\nIn 2013, St. Thomas and St. John had an average home sale price of $713,183, while the average home\nsale price in St. Croix was $306,083. While prices have not caught up with what they were in 2007, St.\nThomas and St. John have seen some recovery in the overall housing market. St. Croix, however,\ncontinues to suffer from the closing of the Hovensa refinery. In 2014, the average single family home\nsales price in St. Croix was $334,167, while in St. Thomas it was $909,839. 2015 year to date averages\nare show an increase in average single family home price in St. Croix and a decrease in St. Thomas and\nSt. John, with averages of $414,178 and $759,811 respectively.\n\nire\nIGY American Yacht Harbor Marina\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018827",
