Right. So I'm going to\njust exclude -~ I take it your question isn't\nasking about any communications,\n\nBY MR.

Okay. So Juan Alessi's\n\ndeposition, Alfredo Rodriguez's deposition, and\nthen considerable circumstantial evidence which\nwe don't have to rehash here involving the close\npersonal association between Epstein and\nDershowitz.\nI mean, again, we can rehash all of that, but\n\nthose were -- those are -- that's kind of a\nquick -- because I know you want to get to a lot\nof questions -- that's a quick sort of highlight\nfilm, if you will.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Mr. Cassell, isn't it true that Mr. Rodriguez\nwas not hired until several years after the Summer --\n\nA. 2004.\n\nQ. Let me ask it again.\n\n-- until well after 2002?\n\nA. Yeah, about 2004.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n243\n\nQ. And Mr. Rodriguez would have no personal\nknowledge of how often Professor Dershowitz visited\nduring a period two years or three years before he was\nhired; isn't that true?\n\nA. So, look, this is -- this is why I was trying\nto speed up the answer to the question. We have a sex\ntrafficking organization that is running a common scheme\nand plan that is continuing on until it was interrupted\nby law enforcement about 2005 and 2006.\n\nSo what the -- the criminal organization is\ndoing in 2004, unless I have some significant evidence\nthat it's different than what was going on in 2002,\n2001, 2000, 1999, I think it's reasonable to conclude\nthat the same sort of criminal activities are going on\nlater.\n\nSo if -- if you want -- if you want me to get\ninto the -~ the full scope of the criminal organization,\nwe can get into it. But the fact that somebody in 2004\nsees this going on, leads me to conclude that it’s\nprobably the same thing going on in the absence of other\ninformation in 2001.\n\nQ. So from Mr. Rodriguez's testimony about what\nwas going on, so to speak -- and my question related,\nwhat was going on the number of times that Professor\nDershowitz visited. That's the topic.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010863",
