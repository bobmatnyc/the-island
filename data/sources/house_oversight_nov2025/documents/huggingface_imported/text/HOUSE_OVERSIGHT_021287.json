The\nconnection with the mother that begins\n\n‘ The lead author is Louise C. Hawkley, Ph.D., a\nSenior Research Scientist (Assistant Professor),\nmember of the Center for Cognitive and Social\nNeuroscience, and Associate Director of the\nSocial Neuroscience Laboratory at the University\nof Chicago. Her research is concerned with the\ninterplay of psychological and physiological\nfactors, and includes the study of autonomic,\nneuroendocrine, immune, genetic, and behavioral\nprocesses that contribute to physical and mental\nhealth and well-being in individuals differing in\nperceived social connectedness. She has\npublished numerous articles and chapters on\nperceived social isolation (loneliness) and its\nantecedents and consequences in young and\naging adults.\n\nHawkley finds awe in the significance\nof what it means to be a social species. Atul\nGawande wrote, “We are social not just in the\ntrivial sense that we like company, and not just\nin the obvious sense that we each depend on\nothers. We are social in a more elemental way:\nsimply to exist as a normal human being requires\ninteraction with other people” (The New Yorker,\nMarch 2009). Hawkley believes that we are\nsocial beings to our cellular core, and even that\ndoes not capture the full extent of our sociality.\nFor these reasons, she is increasingly\nuncomfortable with the term “loneliness,” a term\nthat is laden with popular definitions and\nunderstandings that only hint at the deeper\nsignificance of our social nature. As she shows,\nwhat the study of loneliness actually reveals is\nthat feeling wanted and accepted and like one\nbelongs are as vital to our existence as the air we\nbreathe. Nothing kills like being denied a\nsocially meaningful existence.\n\nadults\n\nPage |4l\n\nin utero does not end with the physical\nsevering of the umbilical cord but\ncontinues in a lengthy dependence on the\nmother or primary caregiver(s) for food\nand safety. Years are needed for the\ninfant to reach physical and reproductive\nmaturation, but as Cacioppo notes, even\nmore importantly these years are needed\nfor the infant to develop the social and\nemotional skills necessary for survival in\na complex social world. We graduate\nfrom infantile dependence not to\nindependence but to interdependence\n(cooperation, trust, reciprocity, etc.).\nThat we are born to and for connection\nexplains why feeling disconnected,\nisolated, and like we don’t belong can be\nso painful. We call these feelings\nloneliness. Feelings of loneliness\nfunction like physical pain or hunger or\nthirst; they motivate us to alleviate the\nsocial pain and to repair our sense of\nconnectedness. This is an important\nadaptive function of loneliness because\npeople who feel connected fare much\nbetter than those who feel disconnected.\nThey are not only happier but also\nhealthier than their more lonely\ncounterparts. As we will see, the power\nof felt connectedness reverberates\nthroughout the human body. As was\naptly stated by Frederick Buechner,\n“You can kiss your family and friends\ngood-bye and put miles between you,\nbut at the same time you carry them with\nyou in your heart, your mind, your\nstomach, because you do not just live in\na world but a world lives in you.”’ We\ntend to take for granted our sense of\nsocial connectedness, but that should not\nblind us to its powerful, albeit invisible,\ninfluence on our lives. Its impact is best\nexposed when we observe the effects of\nits absence (i.e., loneliness) on physical\nand mental health and well-being.\nLoneliness is a Health Risk, but How?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021287",
