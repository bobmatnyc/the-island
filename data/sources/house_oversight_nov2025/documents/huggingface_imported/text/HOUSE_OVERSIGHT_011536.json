  "text": "ambitious. We intended to bug the communications line running east from\nBanias, the Syrians’ base in the north of the Golan, toward Quneitra, their main\nheadquarters. That meant taking a longer route, beginning with a climb onto a\nplateau about 200 feet high and crossing the Banias River toward the Syrian\nbase.\n\nWe had nearly three weeks for our final preparations. After two years of\nsayeret training, I was confident that, physically, we would be up to the task.\nBut even without the obvious jitters emanating from the kirva, I could not help\nbut be aware of the possibility, and the cost, of failure. Every evening, I would\nstake out time to go through everything that might conceivably go wrong. Years\nlater, when I went to do my graduate studies at Stanford, I was exposed to\nwords of wisdom from a non-kibbutznik — Benjamin Franklin — which probably\nbest summed up what drove my planning for the sayeret’s first operation, and\nthe others that would follow. “Failing to prepare,” he wrote, “is to preparing for\nfailure.”\n\nRunning into Syrian soldiers was, of course, top of the list of potential\npitfalls. But land mines were also a danger. I got a map of the area from military\nintelligence which, in theory at least, showed the location of mines all along the\nedge of the Golan. But it had been compiled over a period of nearly two decades\non the basis of information from shepherds, smugglers and the occasional Arab\nagent. Whenever they reported seeing the telltale combination of fencing and\nyellow danger triangles, the place was marked. Once it was marked, no one in\nintelligence headquarters dared erase it. The result was that the map now\nshowed an almost unbroken stretch of mines. And within the amount of time\nthat we had to get ready, there was no way of knowing which of the minefields\nwas still there.\n\nThe timing was chosen by the cycle of the moon. We wanted to cross into\nSyria in as near to total darkness as possible. That meant the final days of\nSeptember. Unlike Tubul, who had been commanding the team from the\nmoment they had joined the sayeret, I’d been working with them for only a\ncouple of months. My deputy for the operation, Avi Telem, was also a\nnewcomer. But he was smart, steady and he had served in the Golani Brigade,\nso he knew the terrain along the border.\n\nAvraham could not hide his own nervousness as the operation drew nearer.\nA week before we were due to set off, he asked whether we were planning a\nfurther, full-scale exercise. When I said the final run-through was set for the\nfollowing night, in the Negev, he told me he wanted Meir Har-Zion to attend.\n\n65\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011536",
