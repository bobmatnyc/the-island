You would not be\nable to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In\na sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. |\nhave some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience.\n\nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. | believe Trump offers an ideal\nopportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting\nyou frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you\ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is\nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and\ntechnical proficiency. | know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something\nalong the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and\nperhaps some social media efforts.\n\nSpeaking of which, again, | think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and\ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive,\nexpensive effort.\n\nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and\nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that\nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll\nsurely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will\namp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've\nencountered before.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033589",
