  "text": "from large domestic pension funds and the recovery in the price of copper explain the\nrelative resilience of the currency (Chart 70}. Given the low carry, CLP offers an\nattractive alternative as a funding currency as the portfolio rebalancing of pension funds\nis expected to slow down. We expect the currency to weaken further in 1Q17 as interest\nrates move higher in the US, and we do not expect the central bank to intervene, as it\nwould likely be the case in Peru. In order to reduce the carry cost of the funding\ncurrency without losing the neutral exposure to metals, we like a basket of the Chilean\npeso with the Australian dollar. The Australian dollar is also highly correlated with\ncommodities and China. We are bearish the AUD vs USD, as we expect the currency to\nweaken about 4% by end 1Q17.\n\nBank of America Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 41\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014771",
