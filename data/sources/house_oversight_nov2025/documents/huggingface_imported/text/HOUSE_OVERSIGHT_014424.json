In our view, a Republican sweep would\nfirst lead to JPY strength on risk aversion, but eventually be the most bullish outcome for\nthe USD/JPY. The price action last week — a shallow dip — tells us two things about the\nUSD/PY. First, the view that a GOP sweep would boost the USD/JPY was probably more\nwidely shared than we had thought, so a dip failed to stretch. Second, there may be\nmore potential USD/)PY buyers than sellers, which is in stark contrast to last year, when\nthere were many more potential USD/JPY sellers than buyers (Case for a stronger yen in\n2016 18 December 2015). The “buy-on-dip” cycle in USD/JPY is likely to continue as we\nexpect the pair to reach 115-120 by end-2017. We remain constructive about Japanese\nequities and see banks, insurance continue outperforming REITs near-term.\n\nHigher US rates (esp. if steepening) to boost USD/JPY\nUSD/JPY performs best at the time of UST bear-steepening as better risk sentiment\nreduces the JPY’s safe haven demand and a wider yield spread increases the USD\ndemand from Japanese investors (Exhibit 2). For our US strategists, the clean sweep\nmeans fiscal easing and higher rates, supporting their higher real rate view (A win for\nbond bears and USD bulls 09 November 2016). The USD/JPY has recently tracked real\nyield spread closely (Chart 1), and the pair is gradually producing higher carry as\nmonetary policy is diverging between the US and Japan (Chart 2}. In Japan, fiscal easing\nis also a possibility in light of reduced odds of TPP implementation and a potential early\nsnap election. Any positive impact of Japanese fiscal easing on growth is likely to\nmanifest itself in higher inflation expectations under the Bo)’s yield-targeting regime,\nwhich means Japanese real interest rates can actually fall.\n\nWatch Abe-Trump meeting - coordination or conflict?\n\nGiven the high uncertainty, clarifications on Trump’s policies on trade and currency will\nbe important for the Japanese market going forward. A potential Abe-Trump meeting in\nNew York this Thursday (17 Nov), as reported by Japanese media, warrants attention. We\nsuggested that Trump presidency could potentially reduce flexibility of Abe's political\nand diplomatic strategy, reduce positive market risk from Japanese politics, and increase\nnegative risk from Japan's national security. But this is not known until we see actual\nTrump presidency. If the President-elect shows an understanding for the existing Japan-\nUS alliance and refrains from protectionist rhetoric, it could reduce concerns about\ndeterioration of the bilateral relationship, supporting USD/JPY and potentially exporter\nshares (though reduced odds of TPP implementation is unlikely to change drastically).\n\nTrading ideas and investment strategies discussed herein may give rise to significant risk and are not\nsuitable for all investors.
