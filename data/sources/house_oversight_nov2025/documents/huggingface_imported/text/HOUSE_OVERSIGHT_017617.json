Although OLC’s memorandum characterizes Turner as excluding victims of uncharged conduct, 1°\n\nthe magistrate\njudge adopted an inclusive reading of the statute precisely because of his reservations about the CVRA's legislative history and\nplain language. The judge suggested that \"any person who self-identifies as [a victim]\" could be presumed to qualify for\nprotection under the CVRA as a preliminary matter. !°° In fact, the line quoted by the Department is lifted out of context. The\nfull sentence reads: \"While the offense charged against a defendant can [*79] serve as a basis for identifying a \"crime victim'\nas defined in the CVRA, the class of victims with statutory rights may well be broader.\" !°7\n\nPaletz and Skinner similarly provide scant support for the Department's position. In Skinner, a prison inmate attempted to bring\na pro se civil suit against another inmate for allegedly attacking him during incarceration. !°° In dismissing the suit in an\nunpublished decision, the district court recognized that the Government had expressly declined to bring charges against the\nother inmate and concluded that the CVRA did not create a \"mechanism to bring an action against Defendant directly.\" 1°? In\nPaletz, that same inmate brought a similar pro se claim against another inmate, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, and the\nU.S. Attorney General. !!° In a parallel, unpublished decision, the district court dismissed the suit, noting that the CVRA is\ndesigned to give victims certain rights \"within the prosecutorial process against a criminal defendant.\" 11!\n\nBecause Skinner and Paletz involve (apparently frivolous) civil suits, they say nothing about the CVRA's reach in criminal\ncases, and any language to that effect would be pure dicta. Moreover, the courts' terse analysis in both cases does not contain\nany substantive discussion of whether CVRA rights apply in criminal cases before the filing of charges. Instead, the courts\nsimply cited to language from a Second Circuit decision that stated that the CVRA does not give victims any rights against\ndefendants until those defendants have been convicted !!* - a holding clearly limited to restitution, as many other CVRA rights\nclearly apply before conviction. !!3 Reviewing these two cases in an extended, published opinion, the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of Texas noted that reading these two decisions as standing for the proposition that charges must be filed\nfor CVRA rights to attach \"appears inconsistent with the CVRA recognition of certain subsection (a) rights that apply during\ninvestigation, before any charging instrument is filed.\" '!4 As a result, OLC [*80] vastly overstates its position when it asserts\n\n3 No. 6:07-1389-GRA-WMC, 2007 WL 1875802 (D.S.C.

Supp. 2d at 327 (Instead, I have taken and will continue to follow an inclusive approach: absent an affirmative reason to\nthink otherwise, I will presume that any person whom the government asserts was harmed by conduct attributed to a defendant, as well as any\nperson who self-identifies as such, enjoys all of the procedural and substantive rights set forth in § 3771.\").\n\n7 Id. at 326.\n\n68 Skinner, 2006 WL 1677177, at 1-2.\n\n09 Td. at 2.\n\n® Searcy v.
