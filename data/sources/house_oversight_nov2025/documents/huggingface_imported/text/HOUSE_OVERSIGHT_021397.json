  "text": "transcendence and belonging can\nsimultaneously lead to greater fitness of\nthe individual and increased cohesion\nand sustainability of the social\norganization—another indication of\npositive selection associated with the\nsocial brain.\n\nThe notion of resonance with\nanother appears repeatedly through the\nbook. Our connections to others derive\nin part from being able to see what they\nsee, to hear what they hear, to know\nwhat they know, to feel what they feel.\nOr we have to be able to believe not only\nthat this is possible, but that it happens.\nThe social brain, in which the same\nregions are activated by our own\nexperience of pain and by our perception\nof others in pain, makes both aspects\npossible. There is a close connection\nbetween being able to “feel for” another\n(empathy) and to “see into” another\nmind (anthropomorphism).\n\nLanguage has the potential to\naffect people and groups in part because\nit is tied to meaning. Language is the\nmedium through which we convey,\npreserve, and transmit meaning from one\nindividual to another, and from one\nsocial generation to another. Language\nis powerful because it can activate\nbelief, which in turn can activate\nphysical responses. Words can bind;\nwords can terrify; and words can cause\nphysical pain and death. The power of\nwords comes from the meanings they\nentail about our connections to one\nanother.\n\nParadox\n\nOur investigation of invisible\nforces involving the social brain has led\nus repeatedly to factors that\nfundamentally conflict. An important\ninvisible force is the respect we pay to\nthe boundary between self and other.\n\n151\n\nPage\n\nOur relationship to it comes into play in\nconceptualizing loneliness,\nanthropomorphism, spirituality, group\nbehavior, empathy, and inclusive fitness.\nWhen we speak of loneliness, this\nboundary seems to be an impenetrable\nbarrier. When we speak of empathy or\nanthropomorphism, however, the self-\nother boundary is defined by the\nsimilarity and congruence of individuals\nto one another, providing a transparent\nwindow through which we perceive and\ninteract with others (who must be like\nus). And when we speak of group\nsynchrony, the boundary vanishes\ncompletely: self and other are one.\n\nSuccessful engagement with\nothers requires work. It is the work of\nattending to something, and it is work\nthat often is needed to resolve competing\nforces. Thinking about other minds is a\ndemanding task and requires attentional\neffort. It is this effort that allows us to\nmanipulate the transparency of the self-\nother boundary by what we put in\nthrough learning, attending, seeking, and\nprojecting. In effect, we can tune the\ndegree of resonance we have with\nmembers of different groups. Similarly,\nconsistent attentional effort is also\nrequired for the physician to attend to\nthe mindfulness of patients, for the\nVineyard church member to experience\nGod as present in one’s life, and for\nanother to find connection to an\nomnipresent yet invisible God who\nworks through the very workings of the\nworld.\n\nWhat it means to feel a\nconnection to a higher being is a theme\nthat several essays explore. As is\nevident in these essays, the Network has\nconsidered very different, even\ndivergent, pictures of what such\nconnection might entail. These apparent\ninconsistencies that can be found in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021397",
