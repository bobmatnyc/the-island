While it is still early days, both\nCharlotte’s Web and CV Sciences are EBITDA positive, generating 30% margins in the\nmost recent quarter, which is an encouraging sign. This intersects at a period where\nother companies across the broad cannabis landscape have been investing heavily in\nSG&A, which includes but is not limited to headcount increases and R&D.\n\nFigure 104 CWEB and CVSI Are Posting Strong EBITDA...

Charlotte’s Web is guiding for 2018 revenues to be between\n$65-80 mm, which would represent ~81% growth at the midpoint of the range. For\n2019, the company is guiding for $120-170 mm, which would represent 100% growth\nat the midpoint. Looking out to 2020, current consensus estimates of $295 mm would\nimply further robust growth at over 100%. With momentum in CBD expected to ramp\non a go-forward basis, we would look for these more established, well capitalized\ncompanies such as Charlotte’s Web, CV Sciences and Elixinol to consolidate market\nshare in the form of distribution gains from new channels coming online as well as a\nfrom considerable amount of consolidation.\n\nFigure 106 Charlotte’s Web’s Top-Line Outlook\n\nCharlotte's Web Revenue Estimates (in $ mm)\n\n$350\n$300 YoY Growth:\n$250 2018 = ~81%\n2019 = ~100%\n$200 2020 = ~103%\n$150\n$100\n$50\nso\n\n2017A 2018E 2019E 2020E\n\nSource: Company Reports, Bloomberg\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024876",
