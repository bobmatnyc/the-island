Politics Bubbles Up from the Bottom and Presidential Selection is the Final Coup de Grace of a Political Revolution\nThe proposition of this section of this paper is that elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, state\n\nhouses, state senates and governorships are accurate indicators of Presidential races. If these federal and state elections are\naccurate forecasters in 2016, Hillary Clinton is toast.\n\na.) Politics in the U.S. Congress\n\nIn January 2009, there were 57 Democrats in the U.S. Senate, 2 Independents (Sanders VT and King ME) who always voted\nwith and caucused with the Democrats, and 41 Republicans. Today, there are 54 Republicans, 44 Democrats plus the same\n2 Independents who are effectively Democrats (see Table 5 below).\n\nLikewise, in January 2009, there were 257 Democrats in the U.S. House and 178 Republicans. Today, the tables have turned\nand the Republicans have their largest majority in the House since 1928, 247, and the Democrats have 188 House members.\nNot only have the numbers changed dramatically, but the ideologies have also become more concentrated. The changes in\nthe U.S. Congress over the past eight years are huge and reflect an enormous swing in U.S. political sentiments. But the\ngroundswell doesn’t stop there.\n\nTable 5\nU.S. Senate Count U.S. House Count\nDemocrat Republican Other Democrat Republican Other\n1999-2001 45 55 0 211 223 1\n2001-2003 50 50 0 213 220 2\n2003-2005 48 51 { 205 229 {\n2005-2007 44 55 1 201 233 1\n2007-2009 49 49 2 233 202 0\n2009-2011 57 41 2 257 178 0\n2011-2013 51 47 2 193 242 0\n2013-2015 53 45 2 201 234 0\n2015-2017 44 54 2 188 247 0\nSource: 2009-2016 NCSL *numbers for State data are of January for each year\nSource: Data prior to 2009 census.gov *numbers for state data are of March of each year\nFigure 5 Figure 6\nU.S. Senate Count U.S. House Count\n(two-year cycles, 1999-2017) (two-year cycles, 1999-2017)\n60 260 260\n58 == = Republican 250 «== «= Republican 250\nDemocrat Democrat\n56 240 240\n\\\nil 4 230 230\n52\n220 220\n50\n210 210\n48\nAG 200 200\nA4 190 190\nA2 180 180\n40 170 170\n_ oO Ke) MN oO ~~ oD Ke) M — oO Ke) NM oO _ oD LO MN\n2 i 2 2 2 : z z y 2 2 2 2 2 : z 2 3\nSo st & bw BS SB HF & So £ 6 b@ 8 @ HF H w\n> a S S S S > > > > S Y S > y =\nSource: Senate.gov Source: House.gov\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025305",
