Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and\nmechanics. I was not shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between\nhe and his so called\" advisors\". however as he was out of the office during the most important\ntransaction of the year, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is\nwholly ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a\npriority to get done after consulting with your office _ still remains virtually undone.\n\nIT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off\nexercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead,\nconsultants up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals\nreceived without brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he\nknows little of finance, is run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using\nyour power, to appear larger . Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge\ndifference. bad info is rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer\nexamination it turns out they cannot be used at all. (ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they\nwere deducted on the return they said that is the question they get asked ! \" were they deducted \" not -\"\nis there a benefit\" !!_ I asked for the balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in\n\n2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023256",
