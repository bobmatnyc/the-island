I couldn’t pretend, however, that emotional engagement with new\nacquaintances, even with people I knew and liked but were not close friends,\nwas something that came naturally. And it is also true that from my first\nexperience of the world of numbers as a child on the kibbutz, and as I tackled\never more elaborate pieces on the piano, I did become aware of what might be\ncalled the upside of “a touch of Aspergers” — if that, indeed, is what it is. I was\nconscious of the ease with which my brain translated the complexities into\npictures in my mind. And the joy, at times, with which it allowed me to play\naround with, and develop, what I saw.\n\nBy the summer of 1967, I had experienced that feeling again, in my first real\nencounter with theoretical physics at Hebrew University. After the Six-Day\nWar, I began seriously contemplating a future as a research scientist, or perhaps\neventually a professor of physics. Two months after the war, I enrolled in a\nsummer program at the Weizmann Institute, Israel’s preeminent postgraduate\nresearch facility. Surrounded by some of the country’s, even the world’s,\nleading scientists, and by post-doctoral students determined to follow in their\nfootsteps, was intellectually enthralling. But it turned out to have another effect\non me as well. As I thought more and more about the prospect of joining their\nfraternity once I’d completed my undergraduate degree, I also heard them\ndescribe the way in which pure science sometimes got submerged in simple\nroutine, or, more discouragingly, in the politics and positioning and backbiting\nof the academic world.\n\nI think what finally changed my mind, however, was a feeling, nurtured on\nthe kibbutz but solidified by that many nights I’d spent leading sayeret\noperations across our borders, that I would find my true purpose in life trying to\nmake some special contribution to the future course of Israel. I did not for a\nmoment contemplate politics at that point. Instead, I thought of going back into\nthe military. I realized that in order to make a significant mark, if indeed I\ncould, would require me to serve in the regular army, not just an extraordinary\nunit like Sayeret Matkal. But I did hope that, at some stage, I’d be given the\nopportunity to finish my time in the sayeret as its commander, carrying on\nAvraham’s vision and, ideally, building and expanding on it as well. At least if\nthat part proved possible, I felt that, by comparison, a career in academia would\nbe somehow blinkered, and surely less fulfilling personally. My sayeret\nexperience had also taught me something else as well: that protecting Israel’s\nsecurity was not just a matter of muscle, or firepower, indispensible though they\n\n99\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011570",
