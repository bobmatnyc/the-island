Weinberg, an attorney for Epstein, said in a statement that\nEpstein’s plea was “fairly negotiated by experienced teams of\nattorneys representing each party.”\n\n“It was anything but a sweetheart deal,” Weinberg said. “And it was\ncarefully and fully reviewed not only by senior prosecutors within the\nSouthern District of Florida Office but also at multiple levels of the\nDepartment of Justice in D.C.”\n\nThe government, he said, “avoided litigation risks including the risks of\nan acquittal and Mr. Epstein went to jail, served a period of probation,\nlived up to each and every obligation under the Agreement, and has\nfully conformed his conduct to the law for well over 10 years.”\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-justic...1718903bfc_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c9ebae38dfe7 2/6/19, 7:29 PM\nPage 3 of 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031417",
