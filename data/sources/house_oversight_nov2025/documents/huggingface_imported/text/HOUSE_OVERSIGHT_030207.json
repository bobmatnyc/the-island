  "text": "the possible course I believe deserves most consideration when a sitting president has been\nfound to have committed a crime: indict-and-postpone. While I would not call the few\nmentions of that possibility “mere dicta,” I believe the scant discussion of the point should\nnot preclude an independent judgment by subsequent officials. The notion that such a course\nwould cause reputational harm—though it would not physically interfere with the\npresident’s attention to his duties—seems to be a point of policy, not constitutional law. For\na helpful analysis of this question, see Bob Bauer’s posting.\n\nIn any event, OLC has never suggested that a president cannot be an unindicted co-\nconspirator.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe history of positions taken by the executive branch of the United States on the indictment\nof a sitting president is more varied and complex than is generally assumed. For that reason,\nwhether or not a president can be indicted or named as an unindicted co-conspirator should\nnot be considered a settled question.\n\nI am convinced that putting a president on trial would be inconsistent with the Article IT\nresponsibilities of the modern presidency. Others—Larry Tribe included—are less certain\nand also point to the 25th Amendment, arguing that if being on trial or incarcerated\nprecluded a president from being able to perform his duties, the 25th Amendment provides a\ntheoretical if impractical avenue for the vice president to take over in successive 21-day\nincrements during that time. I see the point, but I believe that approach could too easily set\naside the determination of the electorate. People vote for a president, not a vice president. It\nwould be no small matter, for example, to have had Sarah Palin step in for John McCain.\n\nIf a guilty president is not to be indicted, he or she should in any event be included in the\ncharging instrument as an unindicted co-conspirator, an option that has been expressly\ndefended by the United States before the Supreme Court. And once it has been established\nthat a president can be an unindicted co-conspirator, the case for categorically precluding\nindictment of a president is significantly weakened.\n\n| have argued previously that there should be no categorical bar to the indictment of a sitting\npresident. Clinton v. Jones establishes that a president has a substantial burden of showing\nthat normal processes of litigation are incompatible with his duties—and while that showing\ncan be made for an actual criminal trial, it is difficult to make such a showing for naming a\npresident in a grand jury indictment as long as trial proceedings are postponed until a\npresident is no longer in office.\n\nWhat, then, is the argument against indictment? Perhaps it casts a greater cloud. On the other\nhand, the most important reason for issuing an indictment, rather than merely naming the\npresident as unindicted co-conspirator, is to prevent the statute of limitations from expiring.\nThis, in my view, is an important consideration. Indeed, a president might seek reelection\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030207",
