  "text": "32 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nit's software that matters. A great computer game is great because it is\ncleverly written and has beautiful graphics. The speed of the hardware\nmight help, but it does not define ‘great’\n\nCan we see these software effects in the brain?\n\nNo, unfortunately, this is where our imaging technologies fail. They\nlack sufficient resolution. We would need 100,000 times more resolution\nto see our thoughts, even assuming we would recognize thought if we saw\nit. There is no reason to believe the brain lays out thinking in anything\nresembling the computer software we are accustomed to reading.\n\nThere is one exceptional group of people that does show a software\ndifference on a large-scale — chess players. It seems Chess Masters use\na different part of their brain to process information about chess than\nyou and I. This can be clearly seen on scans of the brain and is such a\ngross effect it even shows up in old-fashioned EEGs - where electrodes\nare taped to your head. Interestingly the effect can be used to predict\ngreatness. Players likely to become Grand Masters show they use a\ndifferent part of their brain from the rest of us at an early age. Chess\nplayers possess the only large scale wiring difference we know of, but\nthere is another group with a visible physical difference, London taxi\ndrivers. Their hippocampi are noticeably larger than the rest of ours. The\nhippocampus does many things, but one of its most significant jobs is to\nmemorize maps. The three years it takes to acquire ‘the knowledge’ and\nthe subsequent years of navigating London's complex streets give cabbies\na 30% larger hippocampus than the average London resident.\n\nIs Intelligence Static?\n\nWe've all seen the headline. Every summer public examination results\ncome out and every year is pronounced a record breaker! Year after year,\nstudents get better and better grades. This creates a problem. There's is no\nbetter grade than an A — and eventually all students get As. Welcome to\ngrade inflation — a problem affecting systems the world over, from British\n‘A levels to Harvard grade point averages. Newspapers are awash with\nstories bemoaning the dumbing down of today’s tests. “Examinations\naren't what they used to be.”\n\nGrade inflation undoubtedly exists and studies of undergraduate\ngrades show progressive compression into the top grades, most competent\nstudents get ‘As, making it difficult to distinguish a good student from a\ngreat one.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015722",
