  "text": "wears glasses. Sometimes while the commercial is on, the actors have\nreconciliation. It is a real fun show.\n\nMommy and Daddy live in New York State. To get a divorce there,\none of them has to commit adultery. Daddy has a tryst with a girl. Mommy\nraids the joint. She brings along a photographer. Mommy has secretly\nbeen having an affair with the photographer. What Daddy doesn’ t know\nwon’ t hurt him. He always wanted to be on Page 3 of the Daily News\nanyhow. Mommy made sure that his undershorts were ironed.\n\nBenjamin Brenner lives in Brooklyn. He is a Supreme Court Justice\nthere. He makes decisions. He decided that raiding the joint is illegal from\nnow on. Unless you have a search warrant. Then it’ s legal, but you have\nto knock first and say, “Benny sent me.” This new rule doesn’ t count for\nhotel rooms. Then it’ s okay to raid the joint. So Daddy better get his own\napartment. Judge Brenner is really under the thumb of real-estate agents.\n\nThere is another way. Mommy can go to Reno. She lives there for six\nweeks. That is called “establishing residence.” Reno is Keno but Alabama\nis Clamor. Same-day service. The Chamber of Commerce invites lawyers to\npractice there. They are promised the run of the divorce mill. More people\n\nare traveling to Alabama than ever before. They are called Freedom Riders.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015055",
