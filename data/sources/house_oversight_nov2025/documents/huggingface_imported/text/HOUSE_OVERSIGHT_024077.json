  "text": "confiscatory taxation; and (v) the possible imposition of non-U.S. taxes on income and gains\nrecognized with respect to such securities. While the General Partner will take these factors into\nconsideration in making investment decisions for the Fund and intends to manage the Fund ina\nmanner to minimize exposure to the foregoing risks, there can be no assurance that the General\nPartner will be able to evaluate the risks accurately or that adverse developments with respect\nto such risks will not adversely affect the value or realization of investments that are held by the\nFund in certain countries.\n\nReserves\n\nAs is customary in the industry, the General Partner may establish reserves for follow-on\ninvestments by the Fund in portfolio companies, operating expenses (including the\nManagement Fee), Fund liabilities, and other matters. Estimating the appropriate amount of\nsuch reserves is difficult, especially for follow-on investment opportunities, which are directly\ntied to the success and capital needs of portfolio companies. Inadequate or excessive reserves\ncould impair the investment returns to the Limited Partners. If reserves are inadequate, the\nFund may be unable to take advantage of attractive follow-on or other investment opportunities\nor to protect its existing investments from dilutive or other punitive terms associated with “pay-\nto-play” or similar provisions. If reserves are excessive, the Fund may decline attractive\ninvestment opportunities or hold unnecessary amounts of capital in money market or similar\nlow-yield accounts.\n\nDiverse Investors\n\nThe Limited Partners may have conflicting investment, tax, and other interests with respect to\ntheir investments in the Fund. The conflicting interests of individual Limited Partners may\nrelate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of investments made by the Fund, the\nstructuring or the acquisition of investments and the timing of disposition of investments. As a\nconsequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the Fund\nManagers, including with respect to the nature or structuring of investments that may be more\nbeneficial for some Limited Partners than for others, particularly with respect to investors’\nindividual tax situations. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for the Fund, the\nGeneral Partner will consider the investment and tax objective of the Fund and the Partners as a\nwhole, not the investment, tax or other objective of any Limited Partner individually.\n\nFailure of Limited Partners to Fulfill Their Commitment Obligations\n\nThe Fund’s investments in portfolio companies will require capital calls on Limited Partners\nover an extended period of time. Failure by a Limited Partner to meet a capital call could result\nin the failure of the Fund to make desired investments, which could have adverse consequences\nfor the Fund and thus all of the Limited Partners. The failure by the Fund to receive a\nsignificant portion of capital contributions due from Limited Partners in respect of their\nCommitments could materially impair the Fund’s ability to realize its financial objectives. In\nthe event that a Limited Partner defaults, such Limited Partner may be subject to various\npenalties, including forfeiture of all or a portion of its interest in the Fund, as provided in the\nPartnership Agreement.\n\nRisk of Dilution\nLimited Partners subscribing for interests at subsequent closings will participate in existing\n\ninvestments of the Fund, diluting the interest of existing Limited Partners therein. Although\nsuch Limited Partners will contribute their pro rata share of prior capital contributions\n\n66 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024077",
