  "text": "134 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nA Simple Poem\n\nRain\nThere are holes in the sky\nWhere the rain gets in\nBut they’re ever so small\nThat’s why the rain is thin.\nSpike Milligan\n\nSpike Milligan\n\nComing upon a poem by chance can be likened to the probability\nof dealing a perfect bridge hand. Shuffle the deck thoroughly and then\ndeal four hands. What is the probability every player will have the ace\nthrough king in a single suit? It’s about 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000 hands.\nBecause lots of people play a lot of bridge around the world, this outcome\nhas been reported quite a few times. The possibility appears within the\nbounds of human experience. Fifty-two playing cards seems close to the\n80 characters that make up this poem and 13 choices of cards is about the\nsame as the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet. Wouldn't we expect poems of\nthis complexity to crop up almost as often?\n\nNO.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015824",
