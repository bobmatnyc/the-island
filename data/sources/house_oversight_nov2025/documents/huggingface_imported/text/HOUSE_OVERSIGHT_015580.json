I had reached out to Joan previously to be included on Jack Scarola's e-mail distribution list\nfor the Dershowitz suit, but I wasn't sure if this would also be handled by them.\n\nI don't want to double up or inundate you, as I know other ITN News colleagues have also been in touch with\nyou. I just wanted to make sure I was on your radar if Judge Marra rules next week.\n\nBest,\n\nDonna Paine\n\nSent from my iPad\n\nOn Jan 23, 2015, at 1:10 PM, Paul Cassell <cassellp @law.utah.edu> wrote:\n\nHi Donna,\n\n| am passing this information along to Joan, who will add this information into our contacts list.
