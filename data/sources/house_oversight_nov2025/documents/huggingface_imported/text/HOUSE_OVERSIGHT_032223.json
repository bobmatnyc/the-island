I will then stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on \nthe New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have \na mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food \nfor the rest of my life out of fear that I will end up like one of these people. \nSent from my iPad \nOn Aug 26, 2015, at 10:09 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nill give you details when i see you, when are you in ny? \nOn Wed, Aug 26, 2015 at 9:28 PM, Kathy Ruemmler \nTrump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart. \nSent from my iPad \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
