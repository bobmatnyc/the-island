  "text": "On top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five “radical”\ncampus speakers, released by the House Internal Security Committee. The\nblacklist was published in the New York Times, and picked up by\nnewspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my\n\ncampus speaking engagements stopped abruptly.\n\nWhen | was assigned to write a piece for the Los Angeles Times, |\ntitled it “| Was a Comedian for the FBI,” because | mentioned that | had\nonce recognized a pair of FBI agents taking notes while | was performing\nat the Community Church in New York. My FBI files later stated that |\n\n“purported to be humorous about the government.” Since when did\n\ntaxpayers provide the funds to cover the FBI’ s theater critics squad?\n\nThe banner headline on the cover of that LA. 7imes Sunday\nCalendar section blared out: Paul Krassner-- “1 Was a Communist for the\nFBI.” \\|n the San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen wrote,\n“Fearing Krassner would sue, the 7imes recalled and destroyed some\n300,000 copies at a cost of about $100,000. Krassner would have laughed,\n\nnot sued.” Or maybe | would've sued and laughed my ass off.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015436",
