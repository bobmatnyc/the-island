  "text": "times are unusual: Jefferson. Napoleon. Su Dongpo, who led the Southern Song\nDynasty to real greatness. Given the difficulty of finding such a match you can\nperhaps understand why history is so often pitched with evil; and why Plato was not\na democrat. He knew how hard the ideal was to achieve; how suspicious we ought to\nbe of it’s accomplishment. You might have in your mind a picture of a perfect Sicilian\ngovernment: Literate, open to foreign ideas and trade, careful to balance the\nprivilege of power with its still heavier obligations. The reality: A homicidal king.\nThe stretched distance between ideal and reality was what Plato and Socrates\nthought philosophy must fill.\n\nAs we consider the immense gap between where we are now - a fracturing,\nstruggling order confronting new power arrangements whose content and speed\nand instincts are all really foreign to all of us - the puzzle is how best to fill the space\nbetween where we are now and where we intend to go. In Plato and Socrates’ age,\nbefore they great emancipation of the Enlightenment, it was only natural that their\nfocus was on the education of kings. This, after all, was where most of the power lay.\nIt was the decisive element: Was the ruler good or bad? But we confront our age\nwith a different balance. What will decide our future, | think, is not merely our rulers\nbut the quality of our citizens. | mean you and me. As we've seen, much of our future\nwill be embodied in highly concentrated, connected systems that move at very rapid\nvelocities and are spliced everywhere with the accelerant of artificial intelligence.\nWe are all preparing ourselves to be subjugated in a sense by these systems and by\ntheir masters. Our best defense will not be to wait for wise leaders, for the\nappearance of men and women bespoke fit to the moment, capable of balancing\ninstinct and interest into a rare balance. They are unlikely to emerge - and just\ngetting rid of the people we have now will be hard enough. Any strategy based on\nhoping for great leadership is too risky for all of us. No, a better best defense is\nfinally to rely on ourselves, to use the inheritance of the Enlightenment - the\nrevolution one that made us citizens and not subjects - to ensure we’re not made\nsubjects yet again, to forces we can’t understand and won't manage to control. In\ntrading our liberty for convenience, we are spending that inheritance too fast now,\ntoo blindly.\n\nIt would be easy enough to say that we all need to become more technical, that we\nneed new versions of Plato’s Academy where we teach our children, our leaders and\nourselves the inside tricks of the wired age. After all, if we’re to prevent the\nmachines and the New Caste and the ripping dangers of a connected age from\ndemolishing everything, we’d best know what they are doing. The need for more\ntechnical knowledge for all of us is, inarguably, clear. As I’ve said, one of our\nproblems is that we live in an era of leaders who honestly don’t have the Seventh\nSense, who lack a fluency even with the mundane quotidian demands of our digital\nfluxus - secure passwords on their own email, say, or an instinct for compressed\nspace and time. Mapped on to the really big policy questions of the day, like the\nprosecution of our wars or the repair of our economics, they are outmatched. So:\nYes, we need political direction informed by a feel for the fast, far-running fibers of\nthe topological landscape that will decide our future. We need men and women who\ncan command networks against network dangers. Linked, high-speed systems, after\n\n200\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018432",
