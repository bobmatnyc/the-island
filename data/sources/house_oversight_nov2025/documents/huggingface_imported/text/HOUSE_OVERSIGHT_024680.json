The success of any dispensary operator or distribu-\ntor depends on anticipating and complying with these regulations.\n\nTax Issues Related to Distribution. States and localities that legalize cannabis are focused on the\npotential to generate tax revenue from the industry. Ambiguous, constantly changing and potentially\nburdensome taxation rules may make it difficult for dispensary operators or distributors to remain in\ngood standing with licensing, regulatory and tax collection agencies and may negatively impact their\nfinancial results.\n\nDistribution Outlook\n\nWe expect dispensaries across the United States to increasingly seek to provide modern retail experi-\nences that are supported by e-commerce applications. We also expect that the most well-run dispensa-\nries will continue to generate significant cash flow at compelling margins. Dispensaries should be able\nto gain advantage by producing their own products, by developing strategic or exclusive relationships\nwith specialty producers or by finding ways to generate customer loyalty. However, oversaturation\nin the number of dispensaries in certain jurisdictions, such as Colorado, has led to a very competi-\ntive environment, consolidation and moratoriums on issuing new local dispensary licenses by various\nmunicipalities.\n\nThe distribution segment is subject to some of the strictest and most frequently changing regu-\nlations applicable to the cannabis industry. While distribution opportunities may arise with changes\nin law, some legislation may cause significant disruption. For example, the number of dispensaries\noperating in the greater Los Angeles region is expected to decrease significantly in the short term as\nCalifornia’s new cannabis regulatory agency begins its oversight and enforcement efforts in 2018.\n\nThe distribution services subsegment in the United States is still in its infancy and has experienced\na number of growing pains related to a lack of well-established distribution channels. For example, a\nNevada law generally requiring dispensaries to use third-party distributors proved troublesome when\ndispensaries sold out of product within 48 hours after legal recreational cannabis sales commenced in\nthe state. As more distribution channels and points of contact are established, we believe that opportu-\nnities for third-party distribution services companies will increase.\n\nIn certain legalized international markets, such as Germany and Uruguay, cannabis products\nare sold primarily through existing pharmacy networks (Argentina plans to do the same). While\ncannabis-derived pharmaceuticals may ultimately be distributed the same way in the United States,\nwe believe the future domestic distribution channels of other types of cannabis products will closely\nresemble those of alcohol and tobacco products.\n\n44 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024680",
