  "text": "A global statistical context for these qualitative differential systems was\ninspired by the Russian mathematician, Andrei Nikolaevic Kolmogorov. In his now\nfamous foundational talk about the stability of classical mechanical systems in the\nfinal session of the 1954 International Congress of Mathematics, he gave public\nbirth to, among other ideas, what has come to be called the ergodic or statistical,\nmeasure theory of dynamical systems. Here, ergodic means the existence of an\ninvariant statistical measure on the phase space attractor of the system that can be\nobtained using a variety of equivalent methods and beginning the count at any of its\npoints. Two phase space objects generated by a dynamical system may look\ndifferent in phase space but their statistical measures may all be the same, L.e.\ninvariant. These qualitative orbits in a box-partitioned space can be visualized as\nPaulus and Geyer’s rats exploring a space and Selz’s path sequences of computer\n\nscreen dot quenches produced by clicking on them with a computer mouse.\n\nA precursor of Kolmogorov’s ergodicity was the earlier ergodicity of Ludwig\nBoltzmann. This describes a suitably partitioned system such that equivalent values\ncome from quantitating the behavior of one single orbit exploring the space of the\nlattice of boxes over very long times time as those obtained from a single aggregate\nphotograph of a// orbits run from all possible starting places simultaneously. The\nergodicity of gas-like molecular randomness implicates systems being in one of only\ntwo possible equilibrium statistical states: measure zero (at most occupying a single\npoint, zero, minimal entropy) or its “complement,” full measure one (occupying all\navailable space in a state of maximal entropy). Joseph Goldstein, a well known\nteacher of meditation, giving advice recorded in Daniel Goleman’s 1977 book on the\nsubject said that all methods of nirvana directed meditation amounted to “...simple\nmathematics ...all systems aiming for One or Zero—union with God or emptiness.”\nIn place of the maximal or minimal values for the H; and Hy entropies of these\nstates of transcendence, we in the world of samsara are stuck in states of in-\nbetween entropy which invariant statistical measures of on phase space shapes\n\nhelp quantify.\n\nTo generalize measures made on rat and computer mouse paths to more\n\ngeneral and idealized systems, after plotting an orbital path in a phase space, we\n\n82\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013582",
