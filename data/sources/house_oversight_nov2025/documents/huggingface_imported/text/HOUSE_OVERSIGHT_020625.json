  "text": "166\n\nBut Japanese activists have never needed encouragement from China on this front.\nThey lead homegrown movements with specific political targets in Japan itself,\nnotably attacking the conservative establishment and defending the country’s “peace\nconstitution.” These well-established groups, the origins of which lie in the Cold War\nsplits of 1950s Japanese politics, have long been attacked from the right in Japan for\nbeing unpatriotic. But none has been linked credibly to Beijing’s United Front Work\nDepartment. Nor is there evidence that they have been manipulated and managed by\nCCP-aligned or directed interests.\n\nThe Japanese Communist Party, which still retains a substantial electoral base, is little\nhelp to Beijing on the ground in Japan. The JCP was pro-Soviet through the Cold War\nand has no special affinity with Beijing.\n\nJapan’s cultural and institutional familiarity with China makes it, in different\nways, less amenable to Chinese influence than it would appear to be at first blush.\nAfter all, Japan has absorbed much from China over many centuries, taking in\nwhat it wanted and adapting it to its own ends, and keeping out much else. On\ntop of that, any notions of Asian solidarity have been subverted since the early\ntwentieth century by war and politics and by the failure of the two countries to\nreach an equilibrium in the aftermath of Japan’s defeat in 1945 and the victory of\nthe Chinese communists in 1949.\n\nProductive Back Channels\n\nThe opaque political cultures of both countries have shaped the way that bilateral\nrelations are conducted. Aside from conventional diplomacy, leaders of the dominant\npolitical parties in China and Japan have extensively used back channels to establish\nunderstandings on sensitive issues, including the overt use of CCP organs, outside of\nnormal state-to-state relations.\n\nThe Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, headed by\nLi Xiaolin, the daughter of former Chinese president Li Xiannian, has long been\n\na forum through which the two sides have conducted dialogues. The Friendship\nAssociation is effectively the public face of the CCP’s UFWD., It is not covert and,\n\nfor all the connotations conjured up in its name, it remains avowedly an arm of the\nparty-state. In that respect, the Friendship Association remains a reliable conduit for\npassing messages between the two countries, especially at a time, as in recent years,\nwhen senior-level political exchanges have been fraught. When bilateral relations\nfroze in 2012 after the clash over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, it was a measure of\nhow dangerous things became that the back channels, or the “pipes,” as the Japanese\ndescribe them, froze, making diplomatic signaling difficult across the East China Sea.\n\nAppendix 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020625",
