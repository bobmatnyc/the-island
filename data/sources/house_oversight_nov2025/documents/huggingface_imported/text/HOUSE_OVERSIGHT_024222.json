It should also be noted that the same structural event\noften affects not one but several companies, and the implementation of these structural changes are\ntypically not one-day events. As such, depending on the situation, we may have the opportunity to\ncapitalize on the same structural change event several times as it develops.\n\nOur research process is our primary idea generator. We travel extensively and, collectively, the 5\ninvestment professionals will have between 600 and close to 1,000 meetings a year as we speak with\ncompanies, regulators, consultants, sell-side analysts and governments.\n\no = ©Why We Take a Global Approach - The “Greatest Gift”\n\nElectron takes a global approach (historically, 40-60% of gross allocated outside the US) to the\nutility sector: i) to spot structural change and resultant inefficiencies early, ii) to provide a wider\ncanvas to allocate capital around the globe to the most attractive (from a risk/reward point of view)\nalpha opportunities and, most importantly, iii) to enable the Electron Global Funds to take advantage\nof the global sector’s very low inter-regional correlation (i.e., correlation of regions within the global\nsector; lowest of all MSCI global sectors — see below).\n\nGlobal Sector Inter-regional Correlations\n\n0.80\nOne of the least\n\n0.70 + correlated sectors\n0.60 -\n0.50 - j\n0.30 +\n0.20 5\n0.10 -\nEe\n\nIse\n\nMaterials\nIndustrials\nEnergy\nFinancials\nCons D\nCons staples\nTelecom\nHealth Care\nUtilities\n\nSource: MSCI, 7 years’ weekly trailing correlation\n\nWe call this very low regional correlation the global utility sector’s greatest gift to long/short\ninvestors as it provides a greater return per unit of risk if one has the ability to dynamically allocate\ncapital to and generate alpha in all regions. There are few long/short global utility funds today given\nthe global utility experience required to capture the greatest gift, as different countries have different\nutility market designs and structures.\n\nThe Electron process starts with a focus on structural change and we embrace the myriad of utility\nmarkets’ differences around the globe because this approach leads to the most attractive alpha\nopportunities and the benefits of the “greatest gift”. We allocate capital dynamically to the most\nattractive alpha opportunities in the global utility industry. As a result, the Electron Global Funds is\nonly one fund, yet the “greatest gift” provides the diversification benefit of 4 relatively uncorrelated\nregions and concentration in the globe’s most attractive alpha opportunities.\n\n21 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024222",
