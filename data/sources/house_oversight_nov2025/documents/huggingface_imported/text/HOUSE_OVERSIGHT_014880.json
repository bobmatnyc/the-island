Referencing the charts below:\n\n¢ Under our base case that assumes $70 oil from 2020, we estimate operating\ncash flow net to Hess would reach over $2.5bn;\n\n¢ Net free cash flow peaks at over $2bn with a net cash outflow at any point in\nthe development of ~$300mm.\n\nChart 2: Hess operating cash flow contribution: Guyana ($70 base case) Chart 3: Hess free cash flow contribution: Guyana ($70 base case)\n3,500 3,000\n3,000 2,500\n2,500 2,000\n2,000 1,500\n1,500 1,000\n1,000 500\n500\n- (500)\n2017 2022 2027 2032 2017 2022 2027 2032\nw Liza Early PS m Liza Phase’ w Liza Phase 2 wLiza Early PS m Liza Phase’ wLiza Phase 2\nm Payara Early PS m Payara Phase m Payara Phase 2 mPayara Early PS = Payara Phase m Payara Phase 2\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nWhile first oil in 2019 is only the early stage of development, it is enough in our view to\nprovide visibility on multiple compression perceived absent from Hess’ investment case\ngiven its focus on short cycle development. However, after the low point in production\nin 2Q17 we suggest Hess has both — short cycle, comprising not only the Bakken but tie\nback opportunities across established infrastructure in Norway and the US GoM — and\nlong cycle in the shape of a transformational opportunity in Guyana, that becomes\ntangible with a likely FID in 2Q17.\n\nImpact on valuation\n\nIn our view, an imminent inflexion point in free cash flow comes with a step change in\nvalue recognition for Hess. Momentum from a >20% jump in production in the six\nmonths of the second half of 2017 carries growth through 2018, with Guyana\naccelerating for a decade from 2019. At our base case we suggest this leaves Hess\n‘discounting’ current strip oil prices at current levels of ~$50 / share.\n\nThe table below sets our PO at our target mid cycle multiple of 5.5x EV/DACF; note this\ndoes not include any value for non-producing Guyana resource value that we estimate at\n~$6/share.\n\nTable 2: At strip oil prices, Hess looks fairly valued based on a target multiple of 5.5x EV/DACF\n2015 2016 2017e 2018 2019e 2020e 2021e\n\nShares Outstanding 284 310 313 313 323 324 324\nMarket Cap 13,119 13,334 13,415 13,415 13,415 13,415 13,415\nNon-producing Guyana NAV - - - -\nNet Debt 3,914 4.074 5,136 6,224 6,985 7,198 7,866\nPreference shares 557 557 557\n\nEV 17,033 17,965 19,108 20,196 20,400 21,213 21,281\nDACF 2,321 1,127 1,847 2,378 2,625 3,030 3,795\nForward EV / DACF 15.1x 9.7x 8.0x 71x 6.7x 5.5x\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\n‘ Bankot America\n8 Hess Corp. | 11 April 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014880",
