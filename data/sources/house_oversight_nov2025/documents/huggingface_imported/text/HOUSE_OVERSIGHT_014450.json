Both sectors have suffered versus the market from\nthe rotation out of defensives and bond proxies. That has reduced the valuation of the\nFood & Beverage sector to less extreme levels. Meanwhile Healthcare looks very\nattractively valued and we see compelling risk reward in the sector on an outright basis\nat current levels.\n\nThe fundamental bull case for Health rests on the strong pipeline of new products for\nthe big cap pharma universe. Our sector analysts forecast EU Pharma to deliver a 2018-\n21E EPS CAGR of 11%, up from mid-single digit levels in recent years. Historically that\nwould justify a PE re-rating and a multiple for the pharma sub-sector nearer 17-18x\nthan the current 13x 2018 PE.\n\nChart 36: Extreme overvaluation in Food & Bev has moderated Chart 37: Healthcare PE - back near market multiple and patent cliff\nlows\n1.80\n; 1.70\n10 HealthCare 12m fwd PE relative\n‘j 1.60\n60\n1.40 1.40\n1.30 1.30\n1.20 1.20\n1.00\n1.00\n0.90 :\n——— Food & Bev 12m fwd PE relative 0.90\n0.80\n2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 0.80\n\n1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES, Bloomberg\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES, Bloomberg\n\nWe believe the Republican clean sweep in the US elections represents a positive\ncatalyst as it significantly decreases the potential for legislative initiatives to\naggressively control drug pricing in the US. The catalyst for the sector to re-rate will\ncome progressively from newsflow around new products. The next 12 months should\nsee progress on this front with several of the European large caps expected to announce\nkey data on important drugs in 2017.\n\nBankof America 2 Global Cross Asset Strategy - Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 19\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014450",
