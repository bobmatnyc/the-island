This is what security services do. If there’s a possibility\nto get information, they will get it.”\n\nEven without Klintsevich’s comments, top American intelligence\nofficers had little doubt that the Russian security services would do\ntheir job. Michael Hayden, for example, who in succession headed\nthree American intelligence services, was certainly in a position to\nappreciate the capabilities of the Russian and Chinese intelligence\nservices. He told me in 2014 that he saw no other possibility than\nthat Snowden would be induced to cooperate in this situation, say-\ning, “I would lose all respect for the Russian and Chinese security\nservices if they haven’t fully exploited everything Snowden had to\ngive.” They certainly had that opportunity when Snowden spent\nalmost six weeks at Sheremetyevo International Airport.

Kucherena did tasks for Putin’s party in the Russian parlia-\nment, or Duma. He had excellent connections in the Russian secu-\nrity apparatus because he served on the oversight committee of the\nFSB. Kucherena offered to serve as Snowden’s pro bono lawyer. On\nJuly 12, Snowden officially retained him as his legal representative in\nMoscow. In explaining the relationship, Kucherena said, “Officially,\nhe is my client, but at the same time, I provide a number of other\nservices to him.” According to Kucherena, Snowden turned down\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 167 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019655",
