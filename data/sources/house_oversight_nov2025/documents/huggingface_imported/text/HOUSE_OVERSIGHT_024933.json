  "text": "actual impact of the crisis on Dubai economically and socially?\n\nIn fact, the campaign has gone much further than that. An American writer, well known for his extreme views,\nwas so keen to project Dubai’s alleged “failure” in the coexistence of cultures, that he went all the way stating\n\nthat Dubai was a place where cultures break up and not where cultures meet. He reached that conclusion based\non the fact that Dubai has jailed and deported a British couple caught having illegal sex on a public beach.\n\nWith regard to the fact that the global crisis effect threatens Dubai’s growth and economy, I can guarantee you\nthat those references constitute \"wishful thinking\" on the part of some people; they are illusions, not realities.\nThe economic foundations and development are firm and stable; otherwise Dubai would not have been able to\ndeal efficiently with the global financial crisis consequences. In addition to that, Dubai is not a city on its own.\nIt isa member of the United Arab Emirates federation, which 1s strong, resilient and successful — a federation\nthat is able to face the most difficult challenges.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, the foreign media are reporting on the “bubble burst.” What would you\ntell the people who are endorsing this view?\n\nI keep hearing the expression of “the bubble” for the past couple of decades. In my opinion, this bubble is found\nonly in the minds of those who often keep repeating it and do not know its meaning. The future will prove to\nthem the truth.\n\nLet me assure you we are fine, we have overcome the crisis with the least amount of losses. In our culture, we\nsay: be virtuous and you will gain. That is why we always look at the half full cup of water, and when we look\nat the empty part, we do not moan over the void, instead we think of better and faster ways to fill it.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, if we were saying this is an unfair campaign against Dubai then, could\nyou explain to us how to get out of the current crisis?\n\nThe impact of the global financial crisis has been felt all over the world. It generated a state of panic in all\ndeveloped economies. It was expected that our region would not be immune to the crisis, especially in view of\nthe fact that it led to the credit freeze, write-downs at banks, deferral of mutual credits, and a freeze on lending\nin some of the wealthiest industrialized countries, such as the United States.\n\nThe crisis hit the world in September 2008, but I think that the panic pha se is over now, especially after the\nintervention of governments in many major countries to regulate financial and banking sectors, and the\nallocation of large sums of money to revitalize their economies. This step has enabled the summit of the G20\nthat was held in London a few days ago, to agree on a package of decisions and actions aimed to revive the\nglobal economy and the organization of the international markets.\n\nFor us in the United Arab Emirates, I can safely say that we have succeeded in containing the risks of the global\nfinancial crisis in record time. This is a result of the good policies of the Central Bank, and the government's\naction to ensure the liquidity of banks and the protection of deposits, and other actions at the local level, such as\nthe additional liquidity that the Abu Dhabi government pumped it into the Emirate’s banks and the bond\nissuance of $20 billion bonds.\n\nThe crisis management in addition to the decisions taken during the G20 summit have spread a high degree of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024933",
