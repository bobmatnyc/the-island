Second, last year’s best-performing sectors—\ncommodities and financials—are well positioned\nto extend their run. Financials—the largest UK\nsector—stands to benefit from rising interest rates,\nwhile the commodity sectors should get a boost\nfrom higher oil prices. Notably, these two sectors\naccount for nearly half of FTSE 100 market\ncapitalization.\n\nWith these tailwinds in mind, we forecast UK\nearnings growth of 11% this year, the highest of\nour estimates across EAFE markets. That said,\ncontinued uncertainty around the implications\nof Brexit coupled with higher interest rates will\nlikely weigh on FTSE 100’s well-above-average\nvaluations. This view, combined with the UK equity\nmarket’s hefty dividend yield of 4.0%, results in a\n4% total return projection for the FTSE 100.\n\nAlthough this return is attractive on its face,\n\nWe project UK earnings growth of\n11% this year, the highest of our\nestimates across EAFE markets.\n\nwe do not believe it offers investors a large enough\nmargin of safety to justify a tactical overweight.\nKeep in mind that significant uncertainties remain\naround the final contours of Brexit. Moreover,\n\na shift by the Bank of England toward raising\ninterest rates this year could reverse much of the\nBritish pound’s depreciation, to the detriment of\nUK earnings. Finally, FTSE 100’s global footprint\ncould magnify any disruption to global trade\nvolumes resulting from protectionist policies.\n\nJapanese Equities: Scaling a Familiar Peak\n\nJapanese equities have experienced their fair share\nof booms and busts over the last 25 years. As seen\nin Exhibit 66, this pattern of offsetting swings has\nresulted in a “fat and flat”!* trading range. With\nthe TOPIX price level again in the upper third of\nits historical band, it is natural to ask whether\n2017 will mark yet another market top in Japan.\nThe earnings outlook is pivotal to answering\nthis question. While our forecast for accelerating\nglobal GDP growth points toward higher\nearnings, near-peak profit margins are\na headwind (see Exhibit 67). Moreover,\nwith less central bank easing given the\nBOJ’s already sizable balance sheet, yen\ndepreciation—a key driver of Japanese\nrevenue growth since 2012—is expected\n\nto moderate this year.
