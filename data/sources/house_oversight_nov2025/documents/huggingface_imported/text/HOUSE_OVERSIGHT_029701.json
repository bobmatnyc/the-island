  "text": "FP: 2013 is the 20th anniversary of the\nOslo negotiations. What was Oslo's\ngreatest success, and its greatest failure?\n\nSE: The fact that, two decades after Oslo,\nwe are still a nation under occupation\nshows that Israeli governments did derail\nit. The interim accords were not supposed\nto last for 20 years but only five. After\nthat, we were going to enjoy freedom and\nsovereignty.\n\nBut Israel increased its settlement\nexpansion. In fact, within 20 years, the\nnumber of settlers almost tripled. The\ninstitution-building efforts led by the\nPalestinian government have been\ncompletely undermined by the lack of\nfreedom. This situation cannot continue.\nOslo succeeded in bringing back 250,000\nPalestinians from the diaspora and\nbuilding the capacity for our state. The\ninternational community failed though,\nby granting Israel an unprecedented\nculture of impunity that allowed them to\nuse negotiations as a means to continue\nrather than stop colonization.\n\nFP: What is the most important\n\nthing Israelis don't understand about\nPalestinians?\n\nSE: That we are not going anywhere. As\nsimple as that. We are not going to\ndisappear just because their government\nbuilds an annexation wall around us.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029701",
