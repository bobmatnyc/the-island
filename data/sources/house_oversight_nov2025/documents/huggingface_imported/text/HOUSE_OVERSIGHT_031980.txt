Dear Mr. Lefkowitz,

Here are the questions I'd like to ask Jeffrey Epstein.
would he be available to answer any of these on the
phone or by email? People have told me some of his
thoughts on background but I wanted to see if he could
tell me or email me anything directly I could use on
the record. Also I'd like to run the information I
already have by you or him.

Thank you,
Alexandra

-what is he chiefly focusing on now? Is he spending
more time on The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation?
Could he talk about his interest in science and the
2011 grants/conference?

-How has his business been affected? Is there any new
direction he's taking it? Does he still have the same
clients or new ones? Is it still at $15 billion?

-Did he still work while in prison? How was that
arranged? with whom was he working/advising?

-where is he spending his time now? How has his social
life changed from three years ago?

-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell?

-what were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions
to his conviction?

-what does he think about the sentence he got- was it
too lenient or too harsh and why?
