When the vote came, on November 11, Bibi squeaked through by a margin\nof 8 to 4, but with five abstentions. That meant less than half of his ministers had\nvoted for it.\n\nThe easy part for him was Knesset ratification, since I had committed Labor to\nsupporting Bibi on any move towards continuing the peace process. The day after\nthe Knesset’s vote, Bibi won the cabinet’s clearance for actual implementation to\nbegin. But it didn’t. With hard-line ministers threatening to bring down the\ngovernment if it did, Bibi again stalled. That was the turning point. I’d made it\nclear our parliamentary support would remain for as long as Bibi moved ahead\nwith what had been agreed at Wye River. It was not intended as a blank check, or\nan offer to prop up a Prime Minister who now seemed to be looking for any way\npossible not to implement the agreement.\n\nMy key ally in what came next was Haim Ramon. Despite our differences over\nthe direction of the Peres election campaign, we had become effective\nparliamentary partners. He had a depth of political experience and knowledge I still\nlacked. While I found the details of how the Knesset operated arcane and often\ntiresome, Haim knew all of it instinctively. When it came to the need for discreet\ndiscussions or bargaining with other parties, not only could he draw on his\npersonal relationships with Knesset members across the party divide. He had the\nadditional advantage of being able to avoid the scrutiny that would follow a direct\napproach from me. Before Bibi had gone to Wye, Haim and I had discussed how\nwe might move to force early elections. The peace process, and the country, were\ndrifting. There seemed no point in waiting, if we could be confident of lining up\nthe necessary votes among the growing number of others who were also convinced\nBibi should go. After the Wye summit agreement, I put all that on hold. But now\nthat Bibi had shifted into reverse, I told Haim to resume his efforts.\n\nIn early December, he told me he had enough votes for a no-confidence motion,\nunder his name, to dissolve the Knesset and pave the way for early elections. The\naxe fell on December 20. Bibi had lost the support of the right-wing, who wanted\nOslo ended altogether. He had now lost me, too. I felt his approach to the peace\nprocess was leaving Israel rudderless. The way we were heading, we would not\njust forfeit any potential benefits from Oslo. We would be leaving a political and\ndiplomatic vacuum at a time when a serious new explosion of Palestinian violence\nwas becoming ever more likely. In the Knesset debate, Bibi made one final bid to\n\n303\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028151",
