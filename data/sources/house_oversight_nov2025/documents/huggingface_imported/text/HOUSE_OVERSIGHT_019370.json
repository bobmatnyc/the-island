And they were girls\n\nIf the women whom Palm Beach\npolice say a part-time town resident\ninvited to his home and paid for\nsex acts were, in fact, women, the\nsolicitation charge against Jeffrey\nEpstein might feel more sufficient.\nBut, according to police records,\nthey weren't. He was over 50. And\nthey were girls.\n\nBs.\n\nTryearold gil\n-vearold girls.\nThat should\n\ncount for some-\nthing — the dit\n\n= ference between\nElisa prostitution and\nCramer pedophilia.\n\nSo, it is baffling\nthat Mr. Epstein, who was indicted\nlast month by a grand jury on one\nfelony count of solicitation of pros-\ntitution, has not been charged, as\nPalm Beach police strenuously\nurged, with unlawful sex acts with\na minor and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation.\n\nConviction of crimes against mi-\nnors would mean steeper penalties\nthan the maximum five-year prison\nterm Mr. Epstein faces if convicted\nof the single count of felony solicita-\ntion. It also would help carry a mes-\nsage of intolerance to perverts who\nprey on girls,\n\nProsecutors did not pursue charg-\nes against Mr Epstein reflecting\nthe age of the victims because they\nassumed a jury would view the girls\nnot as victims but as promiscuous,\nuntrustworthy, willing participants.\nThe presumption is offensive.\n\nMr. Epstein, a 53-yearold Man-\nhattan money manager who has\nhired Harvard law professor Alan\nDershowitz and defense attor\nney Jack Goldberger, has denied\nknowing how old the girls were.\n\nJury should have decided\nif Epstein is a pedophile.\n\nBut police interviews with five\nalleged victims and If witnesses\nunder oath, as well as phone mes-\nsages, a high school transcript and\nother items that police found from\nsearching Mr Epstein’s trash and\n7,234-square-foot waterfront home,\nprovide evidence that he knew the\ngirls were teenagers.\n\nOne girl couldn't show up when\nMr Epstein wanted because she\nhad soccer. Another time, Mr. Ep-\nstein had to wait for his “massage”\nsession because the girl he wanted\nwas still in class.\n\nWhy didn’t State Attorney Barry\nKrischer let a jury decide whether\nto believe the teenagers — in-\ncluding a 16-year-old who went to\nMr. Epstein’s house to “work” in\nDecember 2004 after being asked\nwhether she needed to make money\nfor Christmas gifts?\n\nProsecutors gave greater weight\nto the details Mr. Dershowitz pro-\nvided about the girls in an apparent\neffort to assail their character Mr\nDershowitz pointed out to prosecu-\ntors that some of the teenagers had\ntalked on myspace.com about mari-\njuana and alcohol use.\n\nThe 20-yearold Royal Palm\nBeach woman who told police she\nrecruited girls for Mr Epstein has\na Web page on myspace.com that\nfeatures one girl using the name\n“Pimpin’ Made EZ.”\n\nAlthough no charges of witness\ntampering have been filed, the par\nents of at least one of the teenage\nvictims complained to police of be-\ning followed and intimidated by two\nmen. Police determined that their\n\nvehicles were registered to two pri-\nvate investigators. Mr. Goldberger\ndenied knowing anything about it.\n\nPolice also note in their reports\nthat the state attorney's office of-\nfered Mr Epstein a plea deal that\nwould have placed him on proba-\ntion for five years, allowing him\nultimately to walk away with no\ncriminal record at all.\n\nI asked Mr. Krischer’s spokes-\nman, Mike Edmondson, why the\ncase was referred to a grand jury in-\n\nstead of Mr. Epstein being charged\n\nand facing a trial before a jury. And\nshouldn't the victims’ credibility\nbe a factor to determine whether a\ncrime’s been committed, not wheth-\ner a jury will convict? (After all, as\nMr. Goldberger told The Palm Beach\nPost of Mr. Epstein, “He’s never de-\nnied girls came to the house.”)\n\nEspecially, I asked Mr. Edmond-\nson to explain; Why shouldn’t the\npublic look at this case and think\nthere are two kinds of justice — one\nfor the wealthy and one for the rest\nof us?\n\nMr. Edmondson said he could\n\nnot comment on the case because it ©\n\nis active, but on the latter point, he\noffered, for the sake of “philosophi-\ncal debate”: “Whether wealth buys a\ndifferent standard of justice across\nthe country ... the answer to that\nwould, of course, be yes.”\n\nBut in this case, he said, “regard-\nless of the battery of attorneys, the\noutcome would be the same. Every\nissue that was debated in public was\ndebated in our office before this\ncase went to the grand jury.”\n\nIn this case, it is not the victims’ «\n\ncredibility but the state attorney's\nthat deserves questioning.\n\nElisa Cramer is an editorial writer for\n\nMM\n\nThe Palm Beach Post.
