He was amused by the idea.... He’s like a king in his own world.”\n\nMany people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. They\nsee this as refreshing, given the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan Dershowitz says that, as\nhe was getting to know Epstein, his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if Epstein\nsuddenly filed for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied, “Absolutely. I would be as interested\nin him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his\nideas.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017786",
