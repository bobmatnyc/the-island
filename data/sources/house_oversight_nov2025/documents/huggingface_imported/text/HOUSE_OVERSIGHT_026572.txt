Global Asset Allocation

The J.P. Morgan View

Do US elections change anything?

Asset allocation — The equity market has priced out the Romney win scenario,
but from these levels, our economic and market outlook and risks are
unchanged. These keep us medium-term overweight equities and credit, despite
the likely volatility as the fiscal cliff is negotiated. Within equities, we stay
underweight the US, and move most of the overweight into EM Asia. We have
moved some of our credit overweight from the US to Europe.

Economics — The data flows continue to confirm that June/July was likely the
bottom in global activity growth, and that we are gently lifting from those
levels, even as it will take well into next year before growth returns to trend.

Fixed Income — Look for yields to head higher, but focus more risk on spread
compression trades.

Equities — We focus our overweights on EM Asia, Cyclical stocks and US
Home builders.

Credit — We see the current dip as an opportunity to add risk.
Currencies — Be long the dollar during the fiscal cliff negotiations.

Commodities — A further set of better Chinese economic data keeps us long
base metals.

Equity markets are taking the Obama victory quite badly, with US stocks
down some 4% on Wednesday and Thursday. This has pushed up global bond
markets, and credit spreads are wider, but commodities are largely ignoring this
turmoil. We don’t think an Obama victory truly changes the economic outlook,
or risks, but it does eliminate the Romney hope that appeared to have been in
market pricing.

By definition, the Romney scenario is now priced out of the market. The US
elections confirm the status quo in Washington, and to us, they do so also for

period a relative financial “peace”. The US, in contrast, is at the start of intense
negotiations on how to avoid a fiscal-cliff induced recession next year. Neither
side of the aisle has an interest in being blamed for a recession. But markets will
still be buffeted by a steady news flow on wide gaps between each side’s
position.
