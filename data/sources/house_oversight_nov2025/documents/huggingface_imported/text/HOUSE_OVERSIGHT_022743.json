  "text": "Compounding Epstein’s predicament, the world outside of his\ncarefully constructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems\nnot just ill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping\nabout (i.e. he’s totally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and\nfound him weighing the conflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and\negomaniacal lawyers (along with Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal\nattorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and Clinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the day—\nanyone with new advice, Epstein seemed to hire—as well as a catchall of the\nleading crisis managers, who he seemed to retain at will, all wrangling for\nfees and primacy.\n\nCertainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem\nto involve a through-the-looking-glass logic. The government threatens to\nprosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and various\nfriends, associates, and lovers, or offers an ass-backwards sort of deal in\nwhich Epstein’s lawyers have to go to the Palm Beach authorities and get\nthem to agree to charge him with an offense that will send him to jail and get\nhim a sex offender status. Except that a solicitation charge won’t produce\nthat result. Therefore he has to agree also to a procurement or pimping\ncharge (even though he has paid money, not received it—the sine qua non of\npimping). What’s more, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the\ngirls who want to sue him—and, not to defend himself from their suits—\nforcing him to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-\nfigure sums or more.\n\nHe’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while\nEpstein is now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short his\nsentence, almost all Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their officially\nsentenced time).\n\nThis hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo\nRodriguez, steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with\nEpstein’s activities—but he tries to sell it to an undercover agent. Rodriguez\nis sentenced to 18 months in jail on a charge of theft and of withholding\nevidence (and a further two and half years on a related gun charge). Scott\nRothstein, a lawyer whose firm represented additional girls in their suits\nagainst Epstein, also goes to jail for recruiting investors to pay for these suits\non the fraudulent basis that settlements had already been reached. It’s the\nlargest fraud in Florida history and Rothstein receives a 50-year sentence.\n\nThen, Brad Edwards, Rothstein’s former partner, sues the federal\ngovernment in 2008 for abridging the rights of two of the original\ncomplainants under the Crime Victim Rights Act (giving victims the right to\nbe consulted about the disposition of their cases) regarding the Justice\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022743",
