By the nature of their jobs,\npolice officers look at evi-\n“once from a “one-sided per-\n‘\\wwpective,” Edmondson said.\n“A prosecutor has to look at it\nin a much broader fashion,”\nweighing the veracity of wit-\nnesses and how they may fare\n‘under defense attorneys’\nquestioning, he said.\n\nEpstein’s attorney, Jack\nGoldberger, said his client\ncommitted no crimes.\n\n“The reports and _ state-\nments in question refer to\nfalse accusations that were\nnot charged becatise the Palm\nBeach County state attorney\nquestioned the credibility of\nthe witnesses,” Goldberger\n\nsaid. A county grand jury\n“found the allegations wholly\nunsubstantiated and not\ncredible,” and that’s why his\nclient was not charged with\nsexual activity with minors,\nhe said.\n\nGoldberger said Epstein\npassed a lie detector test ad-\nministered by a reputable\n\n‘ polygraph examiner in which\n\nhe said he did not know the\n\n‘girls were minors. Also, a\n\nsearch warrant served. on\nEpstein’s home found no evi-\ndence to corroborate the\ngirls allegations, Goldberger\n\nAccording to police docu-\nments:\n\ng@ A Palm Beach Commu-\nnity College student said she\ngave Epstein a massage in the\nnude, then brought him six\ngirls, ages 14 to 16, for mas-\nsage and sex-tinged sessions\nat his home.\n\n@A 27-year-old woman\nwho worked as. Epstein’s\npersonal assistant also facili-\ntated the liaisons, phoning\nthe PBCC student to arrange\nfor girls when Epstein was\ncoming to town. And she es-\ncorted the girls upstairs when\nthey arrived, putting fresh\nsheets on amassage table and\nplacing massage oils nearby.\n\n@ Police took sworn\nstatements from five alleged\nvictims and 17 witnesses.\nThey contend that on three\noccasions, Epstein had sex\nwith the girls. ~ .\n\nThe chief's letter\n\nSee the letter Paim Beach Police\nChief Michael Reiter wrote to\nState Attomey Bary Krischer\n\non the Epstein case.\n\nPaimBeachPost.com\n\nA money manager for the\nultra-rich, Epstein was named\none of New York’s most eligi-\nble bachelors in 2003 by The\nNew York Post. He reportedly\nhobnobs with the likes of\nformer President Clinton,\nformer Harvard University\nPresident Lawrence Sum-\nmers and Donald Trump, and\nhas lavish homes in Manhat-\ntan, New Mexico and the Vir-\n\n‘gin Islands.\n\nHe has contributed tens of\nthousands of dollars to Dem-\nocratic Party candidates and\norganizations, including Sen.\nJohn Kerry’s presidential bid,\nand the Senate campaigns of\nJoe Lieberman, Hillary Clin-\nton, Christopher Dodd and\n\nCharles Schumer.\n\nGoldberger is one of five\nattorneys Epstein has re-\ntained since he became the\n\nsubject of an investigation,\n\nEdmondson said. Among the\nothers: Alan Dershowitz, the\nwell-known Harvard law pro-\nfessor and author, who is a\nfriend of Epstein. Dershowitz\ncould not be reached for\ncomment. _\n\nPolice said the woman\nwho enlisted young girls for\n\nEpstein was Haley Robson,’\n\n20, of Royal Palm Beach.\nRobson has worked at an O1-\nive Garden restaurant in\nWellington and said she wasa\njournalism major at Palm\nBeach Community College\nwhen she was questioned by\npolice last October. She has\nan unlisted phone number\nand could not be reached for\ncomment.\n\nRobson said she met Ep-\nstein when, at age 17, a friend\nasked her if she would like to\nmake money giving him a\nmassage. She said she was\ndriven to his five-bedroom,\n7%bath home on the Intra-\ncoastal Waterway, then es-\ncorted upstairs to a bedroom\nwith a massage table and oils.\nEpstein and Robson were\nboth naked during the mas-\nsage, she said, but when he\ngrabbed her buttocks, she\nsaid she didn’t want to be\ntouched.\n\nEpstein said he’d pay her\nto bring him more girls — the\nyounger the better, Robson\ntold police. When she tried\nonce to bring a 23-year-old\nwoman to him, Epstein said\nshe was too old, Robson said.\n\nRobson, who has not been\ncharged in the case, said she\neventually brought six girls to\nEpstein who were paid $200\neach time, Robson said. “I'm\nlike a Heidi Fleiss,” police\nquoted her as saying. The\ngirls knew what to expect\n\n_ when they were taken to Ep-\n\nstein’s home, Robson said.\n\nGive a massage — maybe na-\nked — and allow some\ntouching.\n\nOne 14-year-old girl Rob-\nson.took to meet Epstein led\npolice to start the investiga-\ntion of him in March 2005. A\nrelative of the girl called to say\nshe thought the child had re-\ncently engaged in sex with a\nPalm Beach man. The girl\nthen got into a fight with a\nclassmate who accused her of\nbeing a prostitute, and she\ncouldn’t explain why she had\n$300 in her purse.\n\nThe girl gave police this.\n\naccount of her meeting with\nEpstein:\n\nShe accompanied Robson\nand a second girl to Epstein’s\nhouse on a Sunday in Febru-\nary 2005. Once there, a wom-\nan she thought was Epstein’s\nassistant told the girl to follow\nher upstairs to a room featur-\ning amural of anaked woman,\nseveral photographs of naked\nwomen on a shelf, a hot pink\nand green sofa and amassage\ntable.\n\nShe stripped to her bra:\nand panties and gave him a .\n\nmassage.\n\nEpstein gave the 14-year-\nold $300 and she and the oth-\ner girls left, she said. She said\nRobson told her that Epstein\npaid her $200 that day.\n\nOther girls told similar\nstories. In most accounts,\nEpstein’s personal assistant at\nthe time, Sarah Kellen, now\n27, escorted the girls to Ep-\n\nstein’s bedroom.\n\nKellen, whose most re-\ncent known address is in\nNorth Carolina, has not been\ncharged in the case.\n\nPalm Beach police often\nconducted surveillance of\nEpstein’s home, and at Palm\nBeach International Airport\nto see if his private jet was\nthere, so they would know\nwhen he was in town. Police\nalso arranged repeatedly to .\nreceive his trash from Palm\nBeach sanitation workers,\ncollecting papers with names\nand phone numbers, sex toys\nand female hygiene products.\n\n. One note stated that a fe-\nmale could not come over at 7\np.m. because of soccer. An-\nother said a girl had to work\nSunday — “Monday after\nschool?” And _ still another\nnote contained the work\nhours of a girl, saying she\nleaves school at 11:30 a.m.\nand would come over the next\nday at 10:30 a.m.\n\nOnly three months before\nthe police department probe\nbegan, Epstein donated\n$90,000 to the department for\nthe purchase of a firearms\nsimulator, said Jane Struder,\ntown finance director. The\npurchase was never made.-\nThe money was returned to\nEpstein on Monday, she said.\n\nStaff writers Andrew Mora\n\nand Tim O'Meilia and staff re-\nsearcher Angelica Cortez con-\ntributed to this story.\n\n@ lary_keller@pbpost.com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018919",
