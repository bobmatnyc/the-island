(AP)\nBuckingham Palace officials have again denied claims made by a woman who alleged that she was forced to have\nsex while underage with Prince Andrew, Duke of York.\nThe second denial comes after two Sunday papers in Britain published interviews with the woman in which she\nclaimed that she was forced by American financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew at least three\ntimes between 1999 and 2002. The woman alleges that the encounters took place in London, New York, and on a\nCaribbean island owned by Epstein.\nA Palace spokesman has said that the allegations are \"false and without any foundation.\"\n\"It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with (the woman),\" the\nstatement continued. The denials are unusual because royal officials typically do not comment on allegations\nagainst members of the royal family.\nThe woman's claims are part of a lawsuit in a Florida court relating to how prosecutors handled a sexual abuse case\nagainst American financier Jeffrey Epstein. The woman, identified in court papers only as \"Jane Doe No. 3,\" is one\nof two new accusers asking a West Palm Beach, Florida, judge to allow them to join the existing lawsuit against\nEpstein. The royal is not named as a defendant in the case, and no criminal charges or formal allegations have\nbeen made against him.\n1/2\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-9 Filed 03/17/17 Page 3 of 3\nThe women have objected to how U.S. prosecutors handled Epstein's case, and want authorities to reconsider a\nplea deal that allowed Epstein to avoid much more serious federal charges and potentially longer prison time.\nEpstein served 13 months of an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to a single charge of soliciting prostitution\nbefore being released in 2009.\nIt was not the first time Prince Andrew has faced media scrutiny over his friendship with Epstein. In July 2011 the\nroyal stepped down from his role as a U.K. trade ambassador after he was photographed with Epstein in New York.\nPrince Andrew is the second son and third child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is\nfifth in line to the British throne behind his older brother Prince Charles, nephew Prince William, grandnephew\nPrince George, and nephew Prince Harry.\nThe Sunday Mirror reported that Prince Andrew was on a skiing holiday in Switzerland, where he had been staying\nwith his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.\nIn a further bizarre twist to the story, prominent attorney Alan Dershowitz, who is also named in the court\ndocuments, told the BBC that he is planning legal action against the woman.\n\"If she believes she has been hurt by me and Prince Andrew, she should be suing us for damages,\" the former\nHarvard Law professor said. \"I welcome that lawsuit. I welcome any opportunity that would put her under oath and\nrequire her to state under oath these false allegations.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n2/2\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-10 Filed 03/17/17 Page 1 of 4\nEXHIBIT J\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-10 Filed 03/17/17 Page 2 of 4\nPrince Andrew denies sex abuse claims - CNN.com\nedition.cnn.com /2015/01/22/europe/prince-andrew-sex-abuse-allegations/\nStory highlights\nPrince Andrew addresses crowd at Davos, backs palace statement\nCourt documents show attorneys sent a letter asking to interview him under oath\nBuckingham Palace has strenuously denied claim that he had sex with Virginia Roberts\n\"Firstly, I think I must, want, for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last three weeks. And I\njust wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham\nPalace,\" he said Thursday at the World Economic Forum.\nEarlier this month, Buckingham Palace issued a statement which said, \"It is emphatically denied that the Duke of\nYork [Andrew] had any form of sexual contact or relationship\" with the woman. \"Any claim to the contrary is false and\nwithout foundation.\"\nAndrew is a son of Queen Elizabeth II and a brother of Prince Charles, the next in line for the British throne.\nThe prince is accused of having sex with the woman when she was 17, details of which are is a sworn affidavit in\nFlorida court dated January 19. The woman said that she and the Prince had sex \"three times, including one orgy.\"\nThe court documents showed that her lawyers had sent a letter to Buckingham Palace asking to interview the prince\nunder oath.\nIn her sworn affidavit, the woman described Buckingham Palace's denial that sexual contact ever took place\nbetween the pair as \"false and hurtful to me.\"\nInterview request\nThe woman, identified by Buckingham Palace as Virginia Roberts, first named the prince in a civil motion filed\nDecember 30 in the U.S. District Court in southern Florida in which she claims she was forced to have sex with\nseveral men. She is referred to as Jane Doe No. 3 in the legal filings.\nIn the letter the woman's lawyers sent to Buckingham Palace, attorneys Paul Cassell and Bradley Edwards asked to\ninterview Prince Andrew \"under oath regarding interactions that you had with Jane Doe No. 3 beginning in\napproximately early 2001. Jane Doe No. 3 was then 17 years old.\"\nThe letter includes a picture of the woman and Andrew which was taken around that time, they say. The lawyers also\nwant to discuss subsequent interactions with their client in New York City later that year, the letter says.\n\"The interview could be conducted at a time and place of your choosing, and with your cooperation, I believe the\ninterview could be completed in two hours or less,\" it says.\nNew court pleadings involving the relationship between Jane Doe No. 3 and the prince are being prepared, the letter\nadds, but their filing will be delayed if Andrew accepts the interview request by January 19.\nThe attorney for her legal team confirmed to CNN that Buckingham Palace had refused to accept the letter to Prince\nAndrew and that it was returned to them.\nBuckingham Palace didn't respond Thursday when asked by CNN about the letter.\n1/3\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-10 Filed 03/17/17 Page 3 of 4\nBut the woman's allegations have previously been firmly rejected by Buckingham Palace.\n\"It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.\nAny claim to the contrary is false and without foundation,\" the palace said early this month.\nStatement: I just called him 'Andy'\nPrince Andrew is named in the court filing in Florida as one of a number of prominent people who allegedly had\nsexual contact with teenage girls through self-made billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty some years ago in\nFlorida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation.\nCNN was unable to reach Martin Weinberg, Epstein's attorney, on Thursday.\nIn her first sworn statement to the court, Jane Doe No. 3 gave more details of the alleged encounters.\n\"Epstein made me have sex with Prince Andrew several times,\" she said, according to the court document.\n\"I had sex with him three times, including one orgy. I knew he was a member of the British Royal Family, but I just\ncalled him 'Andy.' \"\nOne day when she was in London, she said, Epstein told her she would be meeting a \"major prince.\"\nShe continued: \"Epstein told me 'to exceed' everything I had been taught. He emphasized that whatever Prince\nAndrew wanted, I was to make sure he got.\"\n'Sexual interests in feet'\nWhen the prince arrived, she was introduced, she said, and \"we kissed formally, cheek to cheek.\" The group went\nfor dinner and to a nightclub where she was served alcohol before returning to the townhouse. The picture referred\nto in the letter, of the prince with Roberts, was taken there, she said.\nAfter the pair were left alone, she said, \"We went to the bathroom and bedroom, which were just steps away from\nwhere the picture was taken. We engaged in sexual activities there. Afterwards, Andy left quickly with his security.\"\nShe said she had reported back to Epstein on the encounter next day, telling him, \"It went great.\"\n\"I told Epstein about Andy's sexual interests in feet. Epstein thought it was very funny. Epstein appeared to be\ncollecting private information about Andy,\" she added.\nRoberts also gave details of two more alleged occasions when the pair had sex. One was in Epstein's New York\nmansion in spring 2001, she said, when she was 17.\nThe third and last occasion was at an orgy involving nine girls on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nher statement said.\n\"I was around 18 at the time. Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls, and I had sex together.\"\nThe other girls, who appeared to be under 18, were \"European looking and sounding\" and didn't really speak\nEnglish, she said. She said she \"felt disgusted\" after the orgy.\n'Voluntarily tell the truth'\nRoberts rejected the palace's denial of the allegations and said she hoped Andrew would agree to be interviewed\nunder oath. \"I did have sexual contact with him as I have described here -- under oath,\" she said.\n2/3\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-10 Filed 03/17/17 Page 4 of 4\n\"Given what he knows and has seen, I was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tell the truth about everything.\"\nRoberts and another woman are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the U.S.\ngovernment to reexamine its case involving Epstein.\nThe investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in 2007 and began serving an 18-month sentence in 2008,\naccording to court documents. He pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procurement of a minor for\nprostitution.\nCNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.\n3/3\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-11 Filed 03/17/17 Page 1 of 8\nEXHIBIT K\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-11 Filed 03/17/17 Page 2 of 8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-11 Filed 03/17/17 Page 3 of 8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-11 Filed 03/17/17 Page 4 of 8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-11 Filed 03/17/17 Page 5 of 8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-11 Filed 03/17/17 Page 6 of 8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-11 Filed 03/17/17 Page 7 of 8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-11 Filed 03/17/17 Page 8 of 8\n\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-12 Filed 03/17/17 Page 1 of 3\nEXHIBIT L\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-12 Filed 03/17/17 Page 2 of 3\nJeffrey Epstein 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts was a 'moneyhungry\nsex kitten', ex friends claim\nwww.dailymail.co.uk /news/article-2974613/Jeffrey-Epstein-sex-slave-money-hungry-sex-kitten-enjoyed-roletravelling-masseuse-former-friends-claim.html\nJeffrey Epstein 'sex slave' lived a lavish lifestyle and enjoyed her role as his\n'travelling masseuse', former friends claim\nVirginia Roberts claims she was recruited to Epstein's harem in 1999\nNamed Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz as men she had to 'service'\nHer friends say there was no indication she was being held captive\nAsked other women if they knew anyone 'slutty' to bring to Epstein\nWould allegedly use cash she gained from sex to live a luxury lifestyle\nBy Wills Robinson For Dailymail.com\nPublished: 12:49 EDT, 1 March 2015 | Updated: 07:09 EDT, 2 March 2015\nShocking: Virginia Roberts' friends claim she was a money-hungry sex kitten' who enjoyed her lavish lifestyle\nThe woman who has accused Jeffery Epstein of keeping her as a sex slave was actually a money-hungry sex kitten'\nwho enjoyed her lavish lifestyle, former friends have claimed.\nVirginia Roberts is currently in the midst of a lawsuit claiming she was recruited to join Epstein's harem of underage\nwomen in 1999, naming Prince Andrew and attorney Alan Dershowitz as two of the men she was made to 'service'.\nBut those who used to be close to the 31-year-old say she relished her role as his 'travelling masseuse' and never\nacted like she was being held captive.\nPhilip Guderyon, who used to date Roberts and would drive her to Epstein's Pal Beach, Florida, mansion told the\nNew York Daily News: 'She was like the head b***h. She’d have like nine or 10 girls she used to bring to him.\n'She never looked like she was being held captive,' he added.

Ct., Broward Cnty., Fla.).\nSTATEMENT OF ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ\nI am pleased that the litigation has concluded and I am gratified by the\nJoint Statement issued today by Jeffrey E. Streitfeld on behalf of the parties, in which\n“Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a mistake to have filed sexual misconduct\naccusations against Dershowitz and the sexual misconduct accusations made in all public\nfilings (including all exhibits) are hereby withdrawn.” Mr. Streitfeld’s announcement and\nthe Joint Statement are copied below.\nANNOUNCEMENT BY JEFFREY E. STREITFELD, FLORIDA SUPREME COURT CERTIFIED CIRCUIT CIVIL\nMEDIATOR (Streitfeldlaw.com)\nIt is my pleasure to report that Bradley J. Edwards, Paul G. Cassell, and Alan M.\nDershowitz have resolved their disputes and have agreed to settle the claims raised in an\naction pending in the Broward County, Florida Circuit Court. Since being appointed by\nCircuit Court Judge Thomas Lynch IV last fall, it has been a privilege to act as the mediator\nand assist the parties and their counsel toward this agreed resolution. I want to extend my\nappreciation for the professionalism exhibited by the parties and their counsel with whom\nI worked directly: Jack Scarola, Rick Simpson, Tom Scott, and Ken Sweder. As part of their\nagreement, the parties have issued the attached Joint Statement.\nJOINT STATEMENT OF BRAD EDWARDS, PAUL CASSELL AND ALAN DERSHOWITZ REGARDING\nSETTLEMENT\nBrad Edwards, Paul Cassell and Alan Dershowitz have today settled their pending\ndefamation claims in which Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz and Dershowitz\ncounterclaimed against Edwards and Cassell. The case was about Dershowitz’s public\nclaims that Edwards and Cassell, as the attorneys for Virginia Roberts, had failed to perform\nthe necessary due diligence before filing the allegations of their client, not whether the acts\nof alleged misconduct in fact occurred. Edwards and Cassell vigorously denied the\ncontention that they had acted improperly and asserted that it defamed them. Dershowitz\ncountersued Edwards and Cassell, alleging they had falsely accused him of sexual contact\nwith Roberts—a claim he vigorously denied and that Dershowitz asserted defamed him.\nEdwards and Cassell maintain that they filed their client’s allegations in good faith and\nperformed the necessary due diligence to do so, and have produced documents detailing\nthose efforts. Dershowitz completely denies any such misconduct, while not disputing\nRoberts’s statements that the underlying alleged misconduct may have occurred with\nsomeone else. Dershowitz has produced travel and other records for the relevant times\nwhich he relies on to establish that he could not have been present when the alleged\nGM_00523\nCase 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 751-18 Filed 03/17/17 Page 3 of 3\nmisconduct occurred. He has also produced other evidence that he relies upon to refute\nthe credibility of the allegations against him.\nThe parties believe it is time to take advantage of the new information that has come to\nlight on both sides during the litigation and put these matters behind them.\nGiven the events that have transpired since the filing of the documents in the federal\ncourt and in this action in which Dershowitz was accused of sexual misconduct, including\nthe court order striking the allegations in the federal court filings, and the records and\nother documents produced by the parties, Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a\nmistake to have filed sexual misconduct accusations against Dershowitz; and the sexual\nmisconduct accusations made in all public filings (including all exhibits) are hereby\nwithdrawn. Dershowitz also withdraws his accusations that Edwards and Cassell acted\nunethically.\nNeither Edwards, Cassell, nor Dershowitz have any intention of repeating the allegations\nagainst one another.\n# # # #\nEditor’s note: Wiley Rein LLP represents Alan M.

Both motions are ripe for review. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that they\nshould be denied.\nI. Background\nThis is an action by two unnamed petitioners, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, seeking to\nprosecute a claim under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771. (DE 1).\nGenerally, they allege that the respondent Government violated their rights under the CVRA by\nfailing to consult with them before negotiating a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein,\nwho subjected them to various sexual crimes while they were minors. (Id.). Petitioners initiated\nthis action in July 2008. (Id.).\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document Document 324 Entered 751-19 on FLSD Filed Docket 03/17/17 04/07/2015 Page 3 of Page 11 2 of 10\nOn December 30, 2014, two other unnamed victims, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4, moved\nto join as petitioners in this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21. (DE 280).\nPetitioners (Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2) support the Rule 21 Motion. (Id. at 11). Jane Doe 3 and\nJane Doe 4 argue that they “have suffered the same violations of their rights under the [CVRA]\nas the” Petitioners, and they “desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well.” (Id. at\n1). The Government vehemently opposes joinder under Rule 21. (DE 290). The Government\nargues that Rule 15 is the proper procedural device for adding parties to an action, not Rule 21.\n(Id. at 1).\n“[O]ut of an abundance of caution,” Petitioners filed a motion to amend their petition\nunder Rule 15, conforming the petition to the evidence and adding Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 as\npetitioners. (DE 311 at 2). The Government opposes the Rule 15 Motion as well. (DE 314).\nAmong other things, the Government argues that amending the petition to include Jane Doe 3\nand Jane Doe 4 should be denied because of their undue delay in seeking to join the proceedings,\nand the undue prejudice that amendment will cause. (Id.).\nAfter considering the parties’ submissions and the proposed amended petition, the Court\nfinds that justice does not require amendment in this instance and exercises its discretion to deny\nthe amendment.\nII. Discussion\n“The decision whether to grant leave to amend a complaint is within the sole discretion of\nthe district court.” Laurie v. Ala. Ct. Crim. Apps., 256 F.3d 1266, 1274 (11th Cir. 2001). “The\ncourt should freely give leave when justice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Justice does\nnot require amendment in several instances, “includ[ing] undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive\n2\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document Document 324 Entered 751-19 on FLSD Filed Docket 03/17/17 04/07/2015 Page 4 of Page 11 3 of 10\non the part of the movant, . . . undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the\namendment, [and] futility of amendment.’” Laurie, 256 F.3d at 1274 (quoting Foman v. Davis,\n371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). In addition to considering the effect of amendment on the parties, the\ncourt must consider “the importance of the amendment on the proper determination of the merits\nof a dispute.” 6 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P. § 1488, p. 814 (3d ed. 2010). Justice does\nnot require amendment where the addition of parties with duplicative claims will not materially\nadvance the resolution of the litigation on the merits. See Herring v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 894\nF.2d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir. 1989).\nA. Rule 21 Motion\nJane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s first attempt to join in this proceeding was brought under\nRule 21. (DE 280). “If parties seek to add a party under Rule 21, courts generally use the\nstandard of Rule 15, governing amendments to pleadings, to determine whether to allow the\naddition.” 12 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P., p. 432 (3d ed. 2013); see also Galustian v.\nPeter, 591 F.3d 724, 729-30 (4th Cir. 2010) (collecting cases and noting that Rule 15(a) applies\nto amendments seeking to add parties); Frank v. U.S. West, Inc., 3 F.3d 1357, 1365 (10th Cir.\n1993) (“A motion to add a party is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) . . . .”).\nRule 21, “Misjoinder and Non-joinder of Parties,” provides the court with a tool for\ncorrecting the “misjoinder” of parties that would otherwise result in dismissal. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n21. Insofar as Rule 21 “relates to the addition of parties, it is intended to permit the bringing in\nof a person, who through inadvertence, mistake or for some other reason, had not been made a\nparty and whose presence as a party is later found necessary or desirable.” United States v. Com.\nBank of N. Am., 31 F.R.D. 133, 135 (S.D.N.Y. 1962) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n3\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document Document 324 Entered 751-19 on FLSD Filed Docket 03/17/17 04/07/2015 Page 5 of Page 11 4 of 10\nIn their Rule 21 Motion, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 do not claim that they were omitted\nfrom this proceeding due to any “inadvertence” or “mistake” by Petitioners; rather, they seek to\njoin this proceeding as parties that could have been permissively joined in the original petition\nunder Rule 20 (“Permissive Joinder of Parties”). As courts generally use the standards of Rule\n15 to evaluate such circumstances, the Court will consider the joinder issue as presented in the\n1\nRule 15 Motion. The Court will consider the arguments presented in the Rule 21 Motion as if\nthey are set forth in the Rule 15 Motion as well. Because the arguments are presented in the Rule\n15 Motion (and because the Court is denying the Rule 15 Motion on its merits, as discussed\nbelow), the Rule 21 Motion will be denied.\nThe Court also concludes that portions of the Rule 21 Motion—and related\nfilings—should be stricken from the record. Pending for this Court’s consideration is a Motion\nfor Limited Intervention filed by Alan M. Dershowitz, who seeks to intervene to “strike the\noutrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and [to] request[] a show cause order to\nthe attorneys that have made them.” (DE 282 at 1). The Court has considered Mr. Dershowitz’s\narguments, but it finds that his intervention is unnecessary as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(f) empowers the Court “on its own” to “strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any\nredundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).\nPetitioners’ Rule 21 Motion consists of relatively little argumentation regarding why the\nCourt should permit them to join in this action: they argue that (1) they were sexually abused by\n1\nThe Court notes that, regardless of which motion it considers, the same standard\ngoverns the addition of parties under Rule 21 and Rule 15. See Goston v. Potter, No. 08-cv-478\nFJS ATB, 2010 WL 4774238, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Universal\nMusic Grp., Inc., 248 F.R.D. 408, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)).\n4\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document Document 324 Entered 751-19 on FLSD Filed Docket 03/17/17 04/07/2015 Page 6 of Page 11 5 of 10\nJeffrey Epstein, and (2) the Government violated their CVRA rights by concealing the nonprosecution\nagreement with them. (DE 280 at 3; see id. at 7-8). However, the bulk of the Rule\n21 Motion consists of copious factual details that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “would prove” “[i]f\nallowed to join this action.” (Id. at 3, 7). Specifically, Jane Doe 3 proffers that she could prove\nthe circumstances under which a non-party introduced her to Mr. Epstein, and how Mr. Epstein\nsexually trafficked her to several high-profile non-party individuals, “including numerous\nprominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known\nPrime Minister, and other world leaders.” (Id. at 3-6). She names several individuals, and she\n2\noffers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they took place. (See id. at 5).\nAt this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary to the\ndetermination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 should be permitted to join Petitioners’\nclaim that the Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The factual details regarding\nwith whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent\nto this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed\nthem CVRA duties), especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not\nrelated to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\nThe original Rule 21 Motion (DE 279) shall be stricken in its entirety, as it is wholly\nsuperseded by the “corrected” version of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 280). From the corrected Rule\n21 Motion, the Court shall strike all factual details regarding Jane Doe 3 between the following\nsentences: “The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from\n2\nJane Doe 4’s proffer is limited to sexual acts between Mr. Epstein and herself. (See DE\n280 at 7-8).\n5\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document Document 324 Entered 751-19 on FLSD Filed Docket 03/17/17 04/07/2015 Page 7 of Page 11 6 of 10\nJane Doe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA” (id. at 3); and “The Government was\nwell aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it listed her as a victim in the\nattachment to the NPA” (id. at 6). As none of Jane Doe 4’s factual details relate to non-parties,\nthe Court finds it unnecessary to strike the portion of the Rule 21 Motion related to her\ncircumstances. Regarding the Declaration in support of Petitioners’ response to Mr.\nDershowitz’s motion to intervene (DE 291-1), the Court shall strike paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 11, 13,\n15, 19 through 53, and 59, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-parties. Regarding\nthe Declaration of Jane Doe 3 in support of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 310-1), the Court shall strike\nparagraphs 7 through 12, 16, 39, and 49, as they contain impertinent details regarding nonparties.\nJane Doe 3 is free to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof,\nshould Petitioners demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a\nmatter presented for the Court’s consideration.\nAs mentioned, Mr. Dershowitz moves to intervene “for the limited purposes of moving to\nstrike the outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and requesting a show cause\norder to the attorneys that have made them.” (DE 282 at 1). As the Court has taken it upon itself\nto strike the impertinent factual details from the Rule 21 Motion and related filings, the Court\nconcludes that Mr. Derschowitz’s intervention in this case is unnecessary. Accordingly, his\n3\nmotion to intervene will be denied as moot. Regarding whether a show cause order should\n3\nThis also moots Mr. Dershowitz’s Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Reply in\nSupport of Motion for Limited Intervention. (DE 317). Denying Mr. Dershowitz’s motion to\nintervene also renders moot Petitioners’ motion (DE 292) to file a sealed document supporting its\nresponse to Mr. Dershowitz’s motion. It will accordingly be denied as moot, and DE 293 (the\nsealed response) will be stricken from the record.\n6\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document Document 324 Entered 751-19 on FLSD Filed Docket 03/17/17 04/07/2015 Page 8 of Page 11 7 of 10\nissue, the Court finds that its action of striking the lurid details from Petitioners’ submissions is\nsanction enough. However, the Court cautions that all counsel are subject to Rule 11’s mandate\nthat all submissions be presented for a proper purpose and factual contentions have evidentiary\nsupport, Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1) and (3), and that the Court may, on its own, strike from any\npleading “any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).\nB. Rule 15 Motion\nBetween their two motions (the Rule 21 Motion and Rule 15 Motion), Jane Doe 3 and\nJane Doe 4 assert that “they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights [under the\nCVRA] as well.” (DE 280 at 1). Although Petitioners already seek the invalidation of Mr.\nEpstein’s non-prosecution agreement on behalf of all “other similarly-situated victims” (DE 189\nat 1; DE 311 at 2, 12, 15, 18-19), Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 argue that they should be fellow\ntravelers in this pursuit, lest they “be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims” resulting\nin “duplicative litigation” (DE 280 at 11). The Court finds that justice does not require adding\nnew parties this late in the proceedings who will raise claims that are admittedly “duplicative” of\nthe claims already presented by Petitioners.\nThe Does’ submissions demonstrate that it is entirely unnecessary for Jane Doe 3 and\nJane Doe 4 to proceed as parties in this action, rather than as fact witnesses available to offer\nrelevant, admissible, and non-cumulative testimony. (See, e.g., DE 280 at 2 (Jane Doe 3 and\nJane Doe 4 “are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims”), 9 (“The new victims\nwill establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in the same way as it\nviolated the rights of the other victims.”), 10 (Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “will simply join in\nmotions that the current victims were going to file in any event.”), 11 (litigating Jane Doe 3 and\n7\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document Document 324 Entered 751-19 on FLSD Filed Docket 03/17/17 04/07/2015 Page 9 of Page 11 8 of 10\nJane Doe 4’s claims would be “duplicative”); DE 298 at 1 n.1 (“As promised . . . Jane Doe No. 3\nand Jane Doe No. 4 do not seek to expand the number of pleadings filed in this case. If allowed\nto join this action, they would simply support the pleadings already being filed by Jane Doe No. 1\nand Jane Doe No. 2.”); DE 311 at 5 n.3 (“[A]ll four victims (represented by the same legal\ncounsel) intend to coordinate efforts and avoid duplicative pleadings.”), 15 (Jane Doe 3 and Jane\nDoe 4 “challenge the same secret agreement—i.e., the NPA that the Government executed with\nEpstein and then concealed from the victims. This is made clear by the proposed amendment\nitself, in which all four victims simply allege the same general facts.”)). As the Does argue at\nlength in their Rule 15 Motion, Jane Doe 1’s original petition “specifically allege[s] that the\nGovernment was violating not only her rights but the rights of other similarly-situated victims.”\n(DE 311 at 2). The Court fails to see why the addition of “other similarly-situated victims” is\nnow necessary to “vindicate their rights as well.” (DE 280 at 1).\nOf course, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 can participate in this litigated effort to vindicate\nthe rights of similarly situated victims—there is no requirement that the evidentiary proof\nsubmitted in this case come only from the named parties. Petitioners point out as much, noting\nthat, regardless of whether this Court grants the Rule 15 Motion, “they will call Jane Doe No. 3\nas a witness at any trial.” (DE 311 at 17 n.7). The necessary “participation” of Jane Doe 3 and\nJane Doe 4 in this case can be satisfied by offering their properly supported—and relevant,\nadmissible, and non-cumulative—testimony as needed, whether through testimony at trial\n4\n(see DE 280 at 9) or affidavits submitted to support the relevancy of discovery requests (see\n310-1).\n4\nThe non-party Jane Does clearly understand how to submit affidavits. (See DEs 291-1,\n8\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document Document 324 Entered 751-19 on FLSD Filed Docket 03/17/1704/07/2015 Page 10 of Page 11 9 of 10\nid. at 10). Petitioners do not contend that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s “participation in this\ncase” can only be achieved by listing them as parties.\nAs it stands under the original petition, the merits of this case will be decided based on a\ndetermination of whether the Government violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all\n“other similarly situated victims” under the CVRA. Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 may offer\nrelevant, admissible, and non-cumulative evidence that advances that determination, but their\nparticipation as listed parties is not necessary in that regard. See Herring, 894 F.2d at 1024\n(District court did not abuse its discretion by denying amendment where “addition of more\nplaintiffs . . . would not have affected the issues underlying the grant of summary judgment.”); cf.\nArthur v. Stern, 2008 WL 2620116, at *7 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (Under Rule 15, “courts have held\nthat leave to amend to assert a claim already at issue in [another lawsuit] should not be granted if\nthe same parties are involved, the same substantive claim is raised, and the same relief is\n5\nsought.”). And, as to Jane Doe 4 at least, adding her as a party raises unnecessary questions\n6\nabout whether she is a proper party to this action.\nPetitioners also admit that amending the petition to conform to the evidence—by\nincluding references to the non-prosecution agreement itself—is “unnecessary” as the “existing\npetition is broad enough to cover the developing evidence in this case.” (DE 311). The Court\n5\nThe Court expresses no opinion at this time whether any of the attestations made by\nJane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 in support of their motion will be relevant, admissible, and noncumulative.\n6\nThe Government contends that Jane Doe 4 is not a true “victim” in this case because\nshe was not known at the time the Government negotiated the non-prosecution agreement, and\naccordingly she was not entitled to notification rights under the CVRA. (See DE 290 at 10).\nAny “duplicative” litigation filed by Jane Doe 4 would necessarily raise the issue of whether she\nhas standing under the CVRA under these circumstances.\n9\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document Document 324 Entered 751-19 on FLSD Filed Docket 03/17/17 04/07/2015 Page 11 of Page 11 10 of 10\nagrees, and it concludes that justice does not require amending the petition this late in the\nproceedings.\nIII.
