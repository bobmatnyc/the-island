Jeffrey:

How’s all in our crazy world?

I’m in NY until August 31 (then again, after Beijing, Sept. 25 — Oct. 14). If you are in town, meet?

When convenient, I’d like you to meet Peter Getzels, Closer To Truth producer/director (I’ve worked with
Peter for 12 years); he would very much like to meet you in person, describe the Radical Breakthroughs
process in detail, get your feedback. He would come up from DC. We can always do Skype, of course, but
Peter would appreciate to meet in person early in the process. Breakthroughs is a Big Project, big opportunity
for impact. All are truly excited.

Below are highlights of Breakthroughs progress.

Attached is latest CNN on trade war and below are links (caution: a few weeks old is ancient history in Trump
time).
