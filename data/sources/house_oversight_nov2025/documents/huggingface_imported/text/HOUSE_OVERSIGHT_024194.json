We’re about to see\nhow resilient an equity market is when one of its key selling points is how expensive bonds are. The recent pick-up in\nleading indicators suggests that earnings expectations may stabilize early in the new year.\n� September US retail sales were strong and US housing data continue to improve, although as noted last week, the degree of\nhousing’s contribution to growth remains the big question. There will be economic headwinds next year even if the fiscal\ncliff is negotiated down. See October 9 th EoTM for the full Monty on the fiscal cliff mechanics.\n� We modeled the President’s tax proposals on various demographics of high net worth taxpayers 1 . The results: increases in\neffective tax rates (as % of adjusted gross income) from 4% to 12%, depending on income, investible assets, stock-bond\nownership, state of domicile, etc. It’s unlikely to be enacted as scripted unless there’s a Democratic sweep, but its contours\nprobably indicate where HNW taxation is eventually heading. We don’t have enough info to analyze Romney’s tax plan in\ncomparable detail. On the latter, the Tax Policy Center released a study indicating that capping itemized deductions at $25k\nfor all taxpayers only offsets 32% of the estimated revenue loss from a 20% reduction in income tax rates.\n� Production, capital spending and export data from China show improvement from the weak pace over the summer, although\ndetails reveal a continued decline in manufacturing growth offset by rising gov’t infrastructure spending. China ran a 600\nbillion RMB budget surplus through September, and targets an 800 bn RMB budget deficit this year. I wouldn’t argue that\nall that gov’t spending is going to have a huge productivity benefit, but it should keep things moving. Chinese earnings\ngrowth and business climate surveys remain weak, an unsurprising consequence of excess industrial capacity.\n� In Europe, financial markets continue to rally in the Periphery. Five -year Spanish credit spreads have fallen below 3%\nfrom over 6% last July, and without the ECB firing a single shot (e.g. buying any bonds). The economic data is still bad (a\ncollapse in auto sales similar to 2009), but now it’s just “run-of-the-mill” terrible instead of “look-out-for-that-bank/countryit’s-about-to-default”\nterrible. What is impossible to assess: the ability of Southern Europe to withstand rising social and\npolitical pressures of massive unemployment. Also: watch out for France, where there is a large, growing economic gap vs.\nGermany, and where its President is resisting German demands for centralized budgetary supervision.\nOur annual energy discussion with Vaclav\nEvery year, I sit down with Vaclav Smil from the University of Manitoba to discuss “the year in energy”. Vaclav is one of the\nworld’s foremost experts on energy issues, and has written over 30 books and 300 papers on the subject. In this note, we walk\nthrough what Vaclav identified as the 5 notable energy developments of 2012 2 : energy independence initiatives in the US,\nEurope and Japan; geopolitical implications of rising Chinese oil demand; and another rough year for the electric car.\nThe political backdrop in the Middle East, European concerns about natural gas dependence on Russia, and lingering concerns\nabout nuclear power after Fukushima are factors driving countries to seek greater energy independence. In the US, prospects for\nenergy independence rely mostly on domestically produced oil and natural gas, while in Europe and Japan, they rely on rising\nrenewable energy targets. What’s remarkable is the official sector confidence in Germany and Japan that the transition cost to\nrenewables will be manageable. One indicative data point: the cost of building connections between offshore wind farms and\nthe electricity grid (excluding the cost of the wind turbine itself) can be greater than the cost of building an entire brand new\nnatural gas plant. As always, a renewable energy discussion involves facts, figures, emotion and a large dose of the unknown.\nThe outcome will have important consequences for growth, the cost and availability of electricity and the global balance of\npayments. These developments argue for greater growth and productivity potential in the US, although energy costs are just one\npart of the larger economic and profits equation. Even among US manufacturing companies, energy generally represents only\n5% of total expenses, and is dwarfed by labor costs.\nMichael Cembalest\nJ.P. Morgan Asset Management\n1 Proposed changes affecting U.S. high net worth taxpayers: increased tax rates on ordinary income, dividends and realized capital gains;\nincreased Medicare taxes on earned and unearned income; rising limitations on itemized deductions (state & local taxes, mortgage interest\nand charitable deductions); partial inclusion of municipal income, 401k contributions and employer-paid health benefits in taxable income.\n2 Other items we could have discussed: continued growth of global hydropower, politics around the Keystone XL pipeline, the apparent end\nof Exxon’s collaboration with Craig Venter to develop fuels from genetically modified algae, and the EU’s decision to deemphasize cropbased\nbiofuels due to concerns about greater carbon emissions than the diesel they replace, and high food prices.\n1\nOctober 22, 2012\nThe most important energy developments of 2012: how countries are planning for Independence Day\nI: What might US energy independence look like?\nRising crude oil production in Texas and North Dakota has contributed to a reversal of the long-term US production decline.\nThe latest data (June 2012) show North Dakota now ahead of Alaska’s North Slope.\nCrude oil production by region\nTotal US crude oil production\nMillion barrels crude oil production per day\nMillion barrels crude oil production per day\n2.5\n9.5\n2.0\n1.5\nAlaska\nTexas\n8.5\n7.5\n1.0\n6.5\n0.5\nFederal Offshore\nGulf of Mexico\nNorth Dakota\n0.0\n1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010\nSource: US Energy Information Administration.\n5.5\n4.5\n1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010\nSource: US Energy Information Administration.\nThe growth in US domestic production is notable, but on its own insufficient to result in energy independence since the US still\nimports ~9 mm bpd of oil. But when combined with other factors affecting demand and supply, the concept of energy\nindependence comes into view over the next couple of decades. What is “energy independence”? After some adjustments\n(and I may be underestimating some of them), US net imports could fall to 4-5 mm bpd, a level which can be met by imports\nfrom countries with historically reliable economic and political linkages to the US (everything is relative). The point is not that\nreduced US crude imports will lower oil prices; countries like China with growing oil needs may offset that. What matters\nhere are the economic and geopolitical benefits from (a) not having to design military and foreign policy objectives based\non energy security to the degree the US has over the last 30 years 3 , and (b) being able to reap the growth, employment\nand current account benefits of domestically sourced-oil and natural gas.\nWhat US energy independence might look like\nUS net crude oil imports, million barrels per day\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nNet\nImports\nNet\nImports\n2012 2025\nProjection\nOil imported for refined product exports\nDisplaced by Natural Gas Vehicles\nReduced consumption: CAFE standards\nand Auto Replacement Cycle\nNet increase in domestic production\nSource: US Energy Information Administration, JPMAM.\nCol/Brazil\nMexico\nCanada\nCurrent US\nimports\nFor a review of the assumptions in this chart, see page 3; otherwise, skip to page 4.\n3 See “Addicted to Oil: Strategic Implications of American Oil Policy” from the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army. The piece\noutlines 4 pillars to U.S. national interests: defense of the homeland, promotion of U.S. democratic values, creation of a favorable world\norder, and enhancement of the nation’s economic well-being. According to the authors, each has been negatively impacted by US demand\nfor foreign oil. They believe that U.S. foreign policies that support repressive oil states are diametrically opposed to American values, and\nreversed the 20 th century trend of the U.S. fighting against totalitarianism and in favor of liberty, and in turn caused the U.S. to lose the “war\nfor ideas” that is critical to wining the “war on terror”.\n2\nOctober 22, 2012\nThe most important energy developments of 2012: how countries are planning for Independence Day\nSome detail on the components of increased US energy independence:\nNet increase in domestic production: we have modeled an increase of 1.8 mm bpd. For context, the 2012 Energy Information\nAdministration (EIA) outlook has a variety of crude oil production scenarios for 2025 ranging from no increase to an increase\nof 2.8 mm bpd (the “technically recoverable resource” case). Any production increase from current levels is expected to come\nfrom “tight oil”, extracted from formations such as Bakken and Eagle Ford, and the Permian Basin. While conventional crude\nproduction volumes in the Gulf may rise, these are expected by the EIA to offset declines elsewhere (Alaska). The EIA’s\noptimism is matched by a June 2012 paper from Leonardo Maugeri at Harvard’s Kennedy School, which projects a US crude\noil increase of 2.6 mm bpd by 2020. An illustrative quote 4 :\n“The shale/tight oil boom in the United States is not a temporary bubble, but the most important revolution in the\noil sector in decades. It will probably trigger worldwide emulation over the next decades that might bear surprising results\n- given the fact that most shale/tight oil resources in the world are still unknown and untapped.… Thanks to the\ntechnological revolution brought about by the combined use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, the US is now\nexploiting its huge and virtually untouched shale and tight oil fields, whose production – although still in its infancy – is\nalready skyrocketing in North Dakota and Texas.”\nRegarding the Bakken shale, Maugeri’s estimate of 300 billion barrels of oil in place are exceeded by larger mean estimates\nfrom USGS geochemist Leigh Price and Continental Resources.\nReduced consumption due to higher CAFE standards and\nthe automobile replacement cycle: this is a topic that\ngenerates a lot of debate and technical discussion about\ndriving patterns, but this much is clear: CAFE standards\nand the ongoing replacement of older cars will improve the\nfuel efficiency of the future fleet. The Union for Concerned\nScientists has estimated the benefit of CAFE at 3 million\nbarrels of oil per day by 2030, while the Administration’s\nestimate is 2.2 million by 2025. The average 11-year age of\nUS cars is at the highest level on record, up from 8.5 years\nin 1995. While some of this increase reflects cars with\nimproved lifespans, it also reflects the impact of the\nrecession and pent-up demand to replace older cars. As a\nresult, our estimate of 1.5 mm bpd in oil consumption\nsavings seems reasonable in context.\nCorporate Average Fuel Economy standards\nMiles per gallon, passenger cars\n60\n15\n1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013 2018 2023\nSource: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nImpact of rising penetration of natural gas vehicles: The rationale for natural gas vehicles (NGV) stems from a price per\nmillion BTUs for oil that’s 5x higher than natural gas. The US NGV penetration rate is low, in part due to the chicken/egg\nproblem of the lack of natural gas refueling stations, and a more limited driving range (natural gas tanks generally hold less\nenergy than diesel tanks). But the economics of NGVs are becoming more compelling for taxis, vans and buses that are\ncentrally fueled with limited ranges, and for trucks with established routes where refueling stations can be built every 300-400\nmiles. Such heavy-duty vehicles account for 17% of all petroleum usage in the US. An example: a heavy duty 18-wheeler\nmight travel 60,000 miles per year and get 5 mpg (using 12,000 gallons of diesel fuel). Assuming a $1.5 difference between\ndiesel and liquid natural gas prices, a trucking company could save ~ $18,000 in annual fuel costs. The conversion cost to\nLNG (liquid natural gas) of $70,000 would imply a 4-year payback period, which is short in the scheme of energy trade-offs.\nWe assume a very modest NGV penetration rate of 3%, which translates into reduced oil consumption of 0.3 mm bpd.\nOil imported for export purposes: in 2011, the US exported 0.5 mm bpd in refined petroleum products. As a result, part of the\ncurrent crude oil import tab is simply for re-export, and is not part of the country’s domestic consumption requirement.\n55\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n4 “The Unprecedented Upsurge of Oil Production Capacity and What It Means for the World”, Leonardo Maugeri, Belfer Center for Science\nand International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School, June 2012. See sections 5-9 for a discussion of how shale and tight oil are gradually\nreplacing conventional sources, how hydraulic fracking works, a detailed examination of the Bakken Shale, how EIA and USGS data are\nbackward-looking and underestimate potential growth, the challenges for the US refining industry which has invested in the ability to process\nheavy-sour imports rather than light-sweet oil from shale, pipeline needs and a range of environmental issues. Maugeri was Senior Executive\nVice President of Strategies and Development at ENI, and Executive Chairman of Polimeri Europa, ENI’s petrochemical branch.\n3\nOctober 22, 2012\nThe most important energy developments of 2012: how countries are planning for Independence Day\nII: Is Germany making an impetuous mad dash into renewable energy?\nIn the wake of Fukushima, Chancellor Merkel announced a plan to accelerate the closure of coal and nuclear power plants, with\nthe goal of relying more on renewable energy to fill the gap. Germany is by far the largest user of electricity in Europe and its\nmanufacturing to GDP ratio is high, so the consequences may be substantial. To get a sense of the potential impact, start with\nthe first chart on Germany’s current generating capacity and output by source. While wind and solar installations have increased\nin recent years, their electricity output is less impactful due to wind and solar intermittency.\nThe two largest increases in Germany’s renewable plan are offshore wind and photovoltaic (solar). Offshore wind connections\nare very expensive; according to Netherlands-based transmission system operator TenneT, they work out to ~1.1 million Euros\nper MW, and that’s just for the connection (not the wind turbine itself, that’s extra). That offshore wind connection cost is\neven higher than the 0.8-1.0 million per MW upfront capital cost of building new natural gas plants, using data from RWE AG\n(Essen) and SWB AG (Bremen). Wind is free and natural gas isn’t, so we should look at all-in levelized costs 5 by electricity\nsource. As shown in the second chart, all things considered, offshore wind is a very expensive way for Germany to generate\nelectricity, and solar is higher by another order of magnitude. The relative ordering is similar in other countries.\nSnapshot of current German capacity and generation\nPercent of total\n45%\n40%\nGenerating Capacity\nElectricity Generation\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nCoal Nuclear Natural Gas Wind Solar\nSource: BDEW Bundesverband der Energie-und Wasserwirtschaft e.V.\nLevelized cost of electricity production in Germany\nUSD/MWh\n440\nGermany is a very energy-efficient country, and has among the lowest electricity-to-GDP ratios in Europe. However, the cost of\nelectricity to industrial consumers is already among the highest in Europe when including taxes, and for residential\nconsumers, Germany is the highest. As a result, the proposed shift to renewable energy may further increase electricity prices\nfor both residential and commercial users. There’s not enough data yet to measure the impact so far.\nAverage retail electricity price in 2011:\nresidential segment, EUR/MWh\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nBasic price\nTaxes\nGER BEL ITL SPN NED POR CZE UK FRA GRE\nSource: Wirtschaft & Infastruktur GmbH & Co Planugs - Renewable Energies.\nGermany’s goal: raise the contribution of renewable energy from 20% to 35% by 2020, and to 80% of total consumption\nby 2050. The total cost of financing this transition is estimated at 800 billion Euros by DIW Berlin. The first stage, from now\nuntil 2020, is supposed to cost 200 billion Euros.

That’s probably why the ECB has been\ndoing the heavy lifting in the European bailout: that approach doesn’t look like it will cost Germany any money (yet…..)\nA brief comment on investment opportunities in wind. A recent offshore wind farm project in Germany entailed a fixed sale\nprice contract for electricity at a guaranteed rate of 119 Euros per MWh for 13 years. This compares to 45-50 Euros per MWh\nfor electricity in shorter term German power markets. The investor takes operational and maintenance risks, and the risk of\nwind’s intermittency. With a large gap between the contract price and the spot market, there may be a “windfall” (sorry) for\ninvestors. However, wind investment risks have at times been under-appreciated. In a May 2012 report from Standard &\nPoor’s, the authors note that they had initially rated 7 portfolio and single-asset wind projects as investment-grade. All but one\nhas since fallen below investment-grade, which S&P states is a result of “wind resource deficiency” (wind levels below what\nindustry experts had cited as lower-bound estimates), and higher-than-expected operating and maintenance costs (repairing\ncracked foundations, jack-up rigs to fix gearboxes and blades, etc). On the latter point, S&P indicates that U.S. wind project\nO&M costs stabilized at rates that were 30% to 40% higher than forecast.\nIII: Inherit the Wind: Japan’s energy dilemma after Fukushima\nAmong the challenges Japan has faced in the wake of the tsunami and nuclear meltdown, one of the greatest relates to energy\npolicy. Only 2 of its 54 nuclear reactors are now operating. While Japan may turn some back on temporarily, it expects to\ndecommission all of them within 18 years. Like Germany, Japan plans to increase contributions from renewable energy.\nJapan’s plan entails increases in offshore wind, geothermal power, biomass and tidal power. The government’s preferred plan as\ndescribed by the METI Advisory Committee in September 2012 is #1 in the first chart, which entails no nuclear power by 2031.\nContribution to Japan power generation\nJapan power plant capacity utilization by fuel type\nPercent\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\nPotential 2031\ntargets\nSource: Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, METI Advisory\nCommittee.\n2012\n#1\n#2\n#3\nCo-generation\nRenewables\nHydro\nOil\nLNG\nCoal\nNuclear\nPercent\n100%\nThe first thing to note is that Japan has been able to withstand the reduction in operating nuclear plants through a sharp\nincrease in electricity produced by natural gas plants, and oil-burning plants. However, as shown above in the 2nd chart,\nutilization rates of plants using LNG are rising close to maximum capacity. Consider as well the fact that Japan pays as much as\n5 times more per BTU for its natural gas than the US. As a result, Japan is facing a near-term decision: turn on more nuclear\npower plants, import more LNG or suffer the growth penalty from higher electricity costs resulting from less supply. For a\ncountry that is already suffering from low growth and declining exports, this would be a steep price to pay.\nAs for Japan’s long-term renewable energy plan, it is starting from a lower base than Germany: in 2011 only 1.25% of\nelectricity came from renewable energy other than hydro (which supplied ~9%). The largest single component of its renewable\nenergy plan relies on offshore wind. Japan’s Institute of Energy Economics estimates that offshore wind levelized costs might\nbe only 35% higher than onshore, but Japan has limited experience in both. What may be more relevant is the experience of the\nUnited Kingdom. In a recent auction run by Ofgem (Britain’s electricity and gas market regulator), participants were asked to\nbid on a contract to build connections to offshore wind farms. Using Ofgem’s estimated transfer values, just the cost of\nbuilding the connection for offshore wind farms to the grid is ~$1.05 million per megawatt (MW). As in Germany, this is a bit\nhigher than the UK Department of Energy and Climate estimate for an entire new 850-MW combined cycle natural gas plant.\nFor manufacturing-heavy Germany and Japan, a future based heavily on offshore wind and solar will be a brave new world of\nyet-to-be-determined cost and complexity. According to Vaclav, the “entire green thing is desirable and very much worth\ndoing, but at a measured realistic pace commensurate with overall system conditions and requirements, not guided and\npropelled by naive, unrealistic expectations and impossible goals”.\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\nCoal\nLNG\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\nSource: Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan 2012 Electricity\nReview, J.P.

China’s percentage, on the other\nhand, is rising and now higher than in the US (in dollar terms, US imports are higher but they should converge in a few years).\nChina now has the world’s largest new car market and most extensive network of superhighways. It is making substantial\ninvestments in a renewable energy, and is now the largest solar, wind, nuclear and hydropower market. However, given the\ncurrent lack of a viable, affordable electric car, Chinese fossil fuel consumption is expected to continue to rise. The penetration\nrate of passenger vehicles in China is considerably lower than in other countries. China’s per capita GDP is lower as well, so the\ngap will not close overnight. The second chart below gives a good indication of the potential rise in automobile use in China\nover time. These trends are part of the reason why we do not expect reduced US imports to result in lower oil prices.\nNet imports of crude and petroleum products as a\nAuto penetration rates\npercent of total domestic consumption\nPassenger and commercial vehicles per 1,000 people\n65%\n55%\n45%\n35%\n25%\n15%\n5%\n-5%\n-15%\nChina\n-25%\n1990 1995 2000 2005 2010\nSource: Energy Information Administration, BP.\nUS\nVaclav sees these trends as important, since they affect prospects of China co-operating with the West on containment of\nIran’s nuclear ambitions. Unfortunately for the West, the prospects for co-operation on sanctions appear dim. Some things to\nkeep in mind about China’s relationship with Iran, described in greater detail in a 2012 Rand Institute report:\n� Iran and China share a deep ambivalence about the West given their prior experiences as semi-colonial states in the\nbeginning of the 20 th century. The US supported a coup against a popular Iranian leader in 1953 (and also influenced other\npolitical transitions), and Communist China was under U.S.-led international sanctions for most of its existence.\n� China extended recognition to Iran’s Islamic Republic only 3 days after its founding, and improved relations with Iran\nthrough arms sales during the Iran-Iraq war (small arms, ballistic and anti-cruise ship missiles)\n� China became a net oil importer in 1993, and further strengthened ties with Iran. Once China was accepted into the World\nTrade Organization in 2001, the West lost the little leverage it had over Sino-Iranian ties.\n� From 1985 to 1996, China provided Iran with civil nuclear technology and machinery, assistance in uranium exploration and\nmining, training for nuclear engineers, and instruction on the use of lasers for uranium enrichment. China ended its direct\nsupport for these nuclear programs in 1997. Chinese design and technology are seen in Iranian ballistic and anti-cruise ship\nmissiles, anti-ship mines and fast attack boats.\n� For the last two decades, China has built railroads, bridges, dams, ports and tunnels throughout Iran. In 2007, China became\nIran’s largest trading partner, and the two countries announced plans to broaden bilateral trade to $100 bn per year by 2016.\n� The two countries formed a joint oil and gas committee to broaden energy cooperation. China is the most important investor\nin Iranian exploration and extraction operations, and has been selected to develop the Azadegan and Yadavaran oil and\nnatural gas fields, and the South Pars field. Iran is the largest methanol exporter to China, displacing Saudi Arabia.\n� Iran used to be vulnerable to refined fuel sanctions when it imported 40% of them; China helped Iran build out its refining\ncapacity, and Iran is now a refined fuels exporter.\n� China is paying Iran in rice and medical/engineering supplies (and cash) in exchange for Iranian oil, and a Chinese shipyard\ndelivered the first of 12 supertankers to Iran, giving it extra capacity to transport its oil to Asia.\n� A couple of quotes on the geopolitics of all of this, from the Peking University School of International Studies and Renmin\nUniversity: “It is beneficial for our external environment to have the United States militarily and diplomatically deeply sunk\nin the Mideast to the extent that it can hardly extricate itself”, and “Washington’s deeper involvement in the Middle East is\nfavorable to Beijing, reducing Washington’s ability to place focused attention and pressure on China.” [Rand report]\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\nJapan\nKorea\nTaiwan\n200\nThailand\n100\n0\nIndonesia\nChina\nIndia\n1980 1987 1994 2001 2008\nSource: China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, CEIC, J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC.\n6\nOctober 22, 2012\nThe most important energy developments of 2012: how countries are planning for Independence Day\nBottom line: China has a long history of economic, political and military co-operation with Iran. China has greater economic\nlinkages with the US, but for China, that fact does not negate the advantages of its relationship with Iran, particularly as its\nenergy needs continue to rise, and as it seeks to prevent U.S. domination of the Persian Gulf.\nV: Another rough year for the electric car\nForecasts of greater electric car penetration have been around since the 1970’s. A report by The National Regulatory Research\nInstitute in 1980 aggregated various studies, which predicted 1.2 mm units in use in the US by 1983, 3 mm by 1990, 5 mm by\n1995, 6.2 mm by 1998 and 13 mm by 2000. Instead, only 2.5 mm have been sold since 1999, and this mostly includes hybrids,\nwhich are not true plug-in electric vehicles (most use regenerative braking for short distance trips). Since 2010, only 50,000\nhighway-capable plug-in electric vehicles have been sold in the US, less than 0.03% of all vehicles. For decades, scientists have\nprojected battery breakthroughs using nickel-zinc, iron-air, nickel-air, as well as combinations of zinc with chlorine or air and\nsulfur with sodium or lithium. Progress has been slow. Affordable mass-produced electric cars are still on the drawing board.\n• Toyota cancelled plans for sales of eQ vehicles, claiming that the current capabilities of electric vehicles do not meet\nsociety’s needs. Toyota planned to sell 40,000 plug-in hybrids in Japan this year; only 8,400 have been sold so far\n• After receiving a $529mm loan from the US government, Fisker developed and built the Karma in Finland. Its battery failed\nduring the Consumer Reports test drive, and Fisker subsequently recalled all of its 2012 Karma batteries\n• A123 Systems, Inc., maker of the recalled lithium-ion battery used in the Karma and recipient of a $249mm Federal grant in\n2009, filed for bankruptcy protection on October 16, 2012\n• Tesla cut their delivery targets for 2012 from 5,000 to 2,700-3,250 due to production issues\n• The Chevy Volt is the most successful electric car in the US, but only 16,400 have been sold this year through September,\nvs the goal of 45,000 that was set by the Department of Energy. Sales of the Nissan Leaf in the US are down 28% vs 2011.\nIf you have gotten this far, I hope you enjoyed our annual energy issue.
