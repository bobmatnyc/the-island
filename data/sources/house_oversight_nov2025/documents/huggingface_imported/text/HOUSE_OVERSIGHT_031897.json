Much better to gain leverage by producing low-\nenriched uranium — far from weapons grade — under International\nAtomic Energy Agency inspection and allow rumors to swirl.\n\nSo Iran, long at the top of the Washington agenda, has slid down. It’s\npartly the Arab Spring. It’s partly that you can’t keep saying the same\nthing. People do begin to remember the refrain, although nobody in\nthe large Iran-the-clear-and-present-danger school ever seems to get\ncalled to account. They should be. The nuclear bogeyman obsession\nhas been a distraction from the need to try to tease out a relationship\nwith Tehran, see Iran as it is. Only the most flimsy efforts have been\nmade, insufficient to test the waters.\n\nThose waters are troubled. The Islamic Republic has not recovered\nfrom its convulsion of 2009. It is sickly, consumed by hypocrisy as it\ncheers on some brave Arabs (but not those in Syria) while brutalizing\nits own seekers of the freedom promised in 1979. Arabs aren’t buying\nIranian hypocrisy. Only Iran’s command of Revolutionary Guard\nforce and the opposition’s lack of a shared goal salvage it.\n\nKhamenei is at loggerheads with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,\nwho got into such a sulk recently that he took 11 days off work,\ninfuriating everybody. The Majlis, or parliament, is investigating\nAhmadinejad for various alleged frauds including, of all things, vote-\nbuying in 2009! Ahmadinejad was booed during his June 3 speech\ncommemorating Ayatollah Khomeini’s death. Iran is characterized by\nwhat Farideh Farhi of the University of Hawaii recently termed\n“administrative chaos.”\n\nThat’s not how you make a nuke. When remembering Iran — and it\nmust be remembered — call the fear-mongers to account.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031897",
