  "text": "data - our DNA, our wedding photos, our hopeful voice mails and most essential\nknowledge, our small savings against disaster. In its speed and its depth, in its\nincreasingly comprehensive grasp of each of us and our world, this new network\norder is at once the most amazing thing we've ever created and the most terrifying.\nBut recall, for a moment, Hillis’s dream for his parallel computer: “The ability to\nconfigure the topology of the machine to match the topology of the problem.” What\nif we really could rewire our thinking, our networks and politics and economics to\nmatch the problems we face now? Finally, with the Seventh Sense kicking alive in\neach of us, we can at least see the topological landscape where such a construction\nmight occur. Now we must turn to the exciting question of just how we’d configure it\nto do our bidding.\n\nWe've covered a lot so far; perhaps it is worth a glance back.\n\nFirst, we’ve come to see how networks really operate, the way in which they breed a\nlively connected skein that concentrates and distributes power. These systems are,\nas a result of their very design, plucking apart many of our old structures and ideas.\nRecall my dad, the doctor, ripped one direction by millions of disease advice\nwebsites (distribution) and in the other by massive diagnostic databases\n(concentration). This pulling process creates too, as we saw: Billion-user firms (and\nbillion dollar fortunes) bred with breathtaking speed. Drones, derivatives, waves of\nmigrants torn from their states but plugged into technological tapestries - all of\nthese are products of network power. Connection, we learned, changes the nature of\nany object. You. Me. Money. Terrorists. Pretty much anything. And because there is a\nlot more of the world that has not yet been fully connected, it’s easy to see that we\nlive in a revolutionary age.\n\nSecond, we learned that the world of networks is complex. It’s made up of many\ncomplicated pieces, but complexity is something entirely different: It’s the\nunpredictable and colliding evolution you might see in a rainforest, where\nuncountable forces intermingle to produce life and death, growth and change.\nScientists call this “emergence” - and it is happening on all our connected systems.\nConnection produces new, ripplingly powerful and unpredictable structures. The\nArab Spring. The 2008 financial crisis. Connection changes complicated objects not\nleast by making them complex. This is why our whole world, even the parts we\nmight expect to be most stable, whips around now with a new and wild energy. Ina\nway, we Saw, this should reward a careful confidence: Go ahead and break the old\nsystems. Something new will emerge.\n\nThird, we followed the trail of hackers like the Warez Dudes and discovered\nsomething unnerving about the networks around us. Not only are they\nhoneycombed with dangerous and unpatchable holes, but historically unmatched\namounts of power rests in their central cores. The reason hackers are so eager to get\nto these kernels of power is that in doing so they can manipulate entire landscapes\nof power with a profound efficiency. A “weird machine,” fired with an invisible and\ndangerous hacked logic, is a possibility that flutters through any network. Trade.\nPolitics. Finance. Choices made in the center of network systems will redound on\n\n147\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018379",
