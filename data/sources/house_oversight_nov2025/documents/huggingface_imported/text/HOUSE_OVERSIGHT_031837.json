  "text": "peace with all four neighboring Arab states. And it can be argued\nnow that Assad may see negotiations with Israel as a way to climb\nback from the pariah status he is earning, making him at this juncture\ntruly open to a new peace process.\n\nSuch thinking, whether in Jerusalem or the White House, is foolish\nand even grotesque. There is no possibility that Assad would\nnegotiate seriously and that an agreement could be attained. He is\nnow clinging desperately to power, and his only true allies are Iran\nand Hezbollah. Yet Israel’s (and, one hopes, our own) key\nprecondition to any agreement would necessarily be a clean break in\nthose relationships: an end to the Syrian alliance with Hezbollah and\nIran. Otherwise Israel would be giving the Golan, in effect, to Iran—a\nsuicidal act. No Israeli government would do it, which suggests that\nnegotiations with Assad would have no purpose.\n\nAssad may indeed be open to commencing a negotiation as a means\nto escape international isolation, but that’s all the more reason not to\ngive it to him. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s 2008 talks with Syria\n(via Turkey) allowed Syria to escape the partial isolation the United\nStates had imposed on it in that decade, with zero gain for Israel. This\nis not an experiment worth repeating, for the Assad regime is today\neven more despicable than it was three years ago.\n\nTo react to the murders now taking place all over Syria by embracing\nthe Assad regime would be morally indefensible. Whether Assad can\nbe overthrown soon by the people of Syria is a fair question to ask.\nWill the army stay with him, or will Sunni units rebel? Will the Sunni\nbusiness elites turn against him? How long can the regime survive?\nWe do not yet know the answers. But surely we must avoid any step\nthat could help Assad, rehabilitate his regime, or undermine the\ncourageous struggle of peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Syria.\nThe peace agreements that Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan were\nreal achievements, but there will be no such agreements with the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031837",
