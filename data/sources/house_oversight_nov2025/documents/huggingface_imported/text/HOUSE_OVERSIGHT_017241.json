  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nThis situation was different; because the only purpose of publishing the child’s photograph was to\ncall attention to his penis. Moreover, his parents had not consented their child to being\nphotographed by a paparazzi on an isolated beach, and so the family’s privacy rights had been\nviolated. Eventually, the matter was resolved by “the court of public opinion” and the\n“marketplace of ideas.” Viewers of the blog were so outraged and the person who posted it so\nroundly condemned, that the post was removed.\n\nAnother area of conflict between the First Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights\narises in the context of criminal trials, when the media seeks to publish information—such as an\nexcluded confession—that may prejudice a defendant’s right to a fair trial. A variation on this\ntheme is the media’s refusal to publish the names of alleged rape victims, while publishing the\nnames and mug shots of the defendant. This practice does not directly impinge on the First\nAmendment because the decision not to publish is made by the media, rather than the\ngovernment. Indeed, the Supreme Court has struck down a statute that precluded the media from\npublishing the names of alleged crime victims.\n\nI have been involved in several cases that pitted the rights of the media under the free speech\nrights of the First Amendment, against the fair trial rights of criminal defendants under the Sixth\nAmendment. I have generally been on the side of the First Amendment, while sympathizing with\nthe situation faced by defendants who would prefer to see the press muzzled when it came to their\ncases.\n\nOne case in which I sided with the privacy rights of a public figure over the publication rights of\nthe media was Chappaquiddick. I was part of the defense team organized by Senator Kennedy’s\nstaff. Part of my job was to assure the confidentiality of the testimony given at the inquest\nconcerning the death of Mary Jo Kopenche. The witnesses who were subpoenaed to testify at\nthis secret inquest—especially the young women who shared the house for the weekend—were\nnot offered the right to counsel or other rights available at an open proceeding. We argued with\nsome success, that because the inquest was secret and lacked the usual legal safeguards of public\nhearings, the right of the witnesses to confidentiality trumped the right of the media to immediate\ndisclosure.\n\nThe First Amendment requires that the media and dissenters need breathing room and\npresumption should always be in favor of a maximalist view of free speech. But this presumption\nis not without significant risks to deservedly good reputations which can be damaged by\ndefamatory or ridiculing speech. As with other potentially harmful types of expression,\ndefamation and ridicule come with a heavy price—one we must be prepared to pay to keep the\nFirst Amendment vibrant. Not everyone is prepared to pay that price.\n\n154\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017241",
