  "text": "footage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this\n\nfunding will make all the rest possible.\n\nI can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong.\n\nAnd I can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer,\nmedia manager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at\n\na second stage.\n\nLet me know what you think? And when are we reading Whitman together. Why don't we set a date for Feb\nwhen Poetry in America 3: Whitman is running online and we could screen a little video and then have a\n\ndiscussion around your table with you and some friends?\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\n\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
