  "text": "34\n\nyoung. And this is true moving forward. Some men in the White\nHouse are on the “society” side; some women in the State\nDepartment are on the “government to government” side. And many\nofficials switch sides (and can switch back again) amid the long hours\nof debate. The most common sentiment among foreign-policy\nveterans reflects another familiar Bill Clinton line: “It sure was\nsimpler during the Cold War.”\n\nFor Hillary, the crisis mentality must eventually give way to the more\nmundane realities of running the department. She is midway through\na five-year plan to increase the size of the State Department’s foreign-\nservice staff by 25 percent and double USAID. And she’s taken a leaf\nfrom the Pentagon playbook and launched a “Q.D.D.R.”—\nQuadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The idea is to ask\nall the agencies housed at Foggy Bottom the larger questions—like\nwhether they are even focused on the right things. It’s a huge\nstructural project.\n\nHillary prides herself on sweating the small stuff, too. She’s big on\nfeedback—an intranet “Secretary’s Sounding Board” is bringing the\nsuggestion box into the modern age. She gets high marks from the\nhigh-tech community for “21st-century statecraft” like using texting\nto raise money for Haiti-earthquake victims and an Internet freedom\nagenda she is pushing aggressively. She’s popular with State\nDepartment employees for practical changes like providing full\nbenefits for same-sex partners (“Fix it!” she scolded bureaucrats who\nwere dragging their feet) and building showers to accommodate\npeople who cycle or run to work. In the past, meetings with foreign\nministers featured nothing more than bottled water. Hillary was\nincredulous: “You can get coffee, tea, nuts all over the world, and in\nWashington you get a bottle of water?” She was told, “That’s the way\nwe do it here.” Her chilly retort: “Not anymore.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024991",
