  "text": "Chapter Nine\n\nThe phone rang in our apartment in Palo Alto at 4:30 in the morning. We had\nbeen in the US for barely six weeks. It was the Sixth of October 1973: Yom\nKippur, the holiest date on the Jewish calendar. I was still a bit groggy from the\nnight before. We had been out at a get-to-know-you event for some of the\nseveral dozen Israelis, and several hundred American Jewish students, at\nStanford. While I only vaguely recognized the voice on the other end of the line,\nher words instantly jolted me awake: “The boss is busy,” she said. “But he\nwants you to know. A war has started back home.”\n\nHer boss was Motta Gur, who was by now Israel’s military attaché in\nWashington and was my nominal commander for my period in the United\nStates. “I need to talk to Motta,” I said. She passed him the phone. “I want you\nto know I’m going back,” I told him. Motta’s reply took my mind back 15\nmonths, to our on-again-off-again mission to abduct the Syrian officers, with\nMotta and Dado in the command post, intent on reining in the “young bulls” of\nthe sayeret. “Ehud,” he said, “from what I’m hearing, I don’t think we are\nmissing a major war.”\n\n“What’s this we?” I said. Motta was a general, at the upper reaches of the\narmed forces, officially posted to Washington. I was a young officer, just\nstarting to work my way up the chain of field command. “I can’t afford to miss\neven a non-major war,” I said. “Pll check in with you when I get to New York.”\n\n“Major” would turn out to be, if anything, an understatement. Yet all I knew,\nas I kissed Nava and Michal goodbye and got a cab to San Francisco airport,\nwas that Israel was again at war. By the time I joined the swarm of Israelis\naround the El Al desk at Kennedy eight hours later, the picture was clearer, and\nmore worrying with each new report from back home. Surprise attacks by Syria\nand Egypt — armies we’d not just defeated, but humiliated, six years earlier —\nhad pinned down and pushed back our forces on the Golan Heights and in the\nSinai. Without any advance call-up, many reservists were only now reaching the\nfront lines.\n\nAs hundreds of people pressed for seats on the El Al flight, I was fortunate to\nreceive a boost up the pecking order from another man in line. Since the Sabena\noperation, the existence of Sayeret Matkal had become a bit less secret. Still, the\nidentity of the sayeret commander was known to just a few people outside the\nunit. So skittish were the army security people that before I’d left for Stanford,\n\n146\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011617",
