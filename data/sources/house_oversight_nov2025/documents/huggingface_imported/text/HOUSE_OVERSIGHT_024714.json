Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for\nobtaining a state license to operate its marijuana-related business.\n\n3. Requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the\nbusiness and related parties.\n\n4. Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including\nthe types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (for example, medical\nversus recreational customers).\n\n5. Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business\nand related parties.\n\n6. Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for certain red flags described in the\nFinCEN Memo.\n\n7. Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and\ncommensurate with the risk.\n\nThe FinCEN Memo also guides financial institutions to file various SARs with FinCEN regarding\ncustomers engaged in marijuana-related businesses. According to the memorandum, an institution\nshould file (i) a “Marijuana Limited” SAR for each customer it believes does not violate state law or\nimplicate any Cole Memo priority, (ii) a “Marijuana Priority” SAR for each customer it believes vio-\nlates state law or implicates any Cole Memo priority, and (iii) a “Marijuana Termination” SAR if the\ninstitution decides to terminate a customer relationship in order to maintain an effective anti-money\nlaundering compliance program. The FinCEN Memo outlines certain “red flags” that tend to indicate\nwhich type of SAR filing is appropriate; red flags include the inability of a customer to demonstrate\ncompliance with state law or deposits of amounts of cash inconsistent with its tax returns.\n\nFinCEN periodically publishes information about marijuana-related SAR filings made by deposi-\ntory institutions. From the February 2014 FinCEN Memo publication through June 30, 2017,\nFinCEN received a total of 33,692 marijuana-related SAR filings from a total of 390 banks and credit\nunions. The following graphs based on FinCEN data show the number of monthly Marijuana Limited,\nMarijuana Priority and Marijuana Termination SAR filings for this period and the number of banks\nand credit unions making such filings.\n\n78 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024714",
