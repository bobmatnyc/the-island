  "text": "I am concerned about our addiction to\ninternal quarrels just as much as I am\nconcerned about our conflicts with\nexternal opponents. Our\n\"righteousness\" will not prevail and\nour \"strength\" will crack over time if\nwe do not act decisively to establish,\ngradually yet persistently , norms of\npublic life and civil society — which\nsets norms for what is done and what\nisn’t done far above the criminal\nthreshold... We need profound change\nin the area of respect for the rule of\nlaw, standards of governance, keeping\nthe thin line between freedom of\nexpression and freedom of incitement\n— and immediately hitting the brakes\non racism and Jewish terrorism —\nwhich in my opinion should be treated\nwithin the criminal domain..\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029384",
