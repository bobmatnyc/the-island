Capex revival\nWe also see a fundamental case for higher capital spending. Borrowing rates are very\nlow and will fall further in real terms as inflation rises. Stronger growth and improved\nconfidence should also encourage higher capex. And deepening supply-side constraints\noffer a strong incentive for Japan Inc. to accelerate productivity-enhancing capex,\nensuring that this expansion is durable.\nFor these reasons, we think that the impulse of capital expenditures will likely be higher\nin the non-manufacturing sector, where capacity utilization rates are higher, and labor\nshortages (and hence wage pressures) are more acute (Chart 15 and Chart 16).\nChart 15: Capacity utilization rates by sector Chart 16: Labor shortages by sector\n40 Insufficient AO Insufficient\n0 -20\n10 0\n20 20\n30 40\n40 Excess 60 Excess\n2003 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016 2003 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016\n———BoJ Tankan production capacity - manufacturing, Dl ———BoJ Tankan employment conditions - manufacturing, Dl\nBoJ Tankan production capacity - non-manufacturing, Dl BoJ Tankan employment conditions - non-manufacturing, DI\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bo} Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bo}\n\nChart 17 shows the ratio of personnel costs to sales, using MoF corporate survey data.\nThe ratio is particularly high for lodging & accommodations (23%), eating & drinking\nservices (27%), medical, healthcare & welfare (37%) and education & learning support\n(37%). Somewhat surprisingly, personnel expenses are fairly restrained in retail. But this\nis partly due to the relatively heavy reliance on lower-cost part-time workers. Given the\nrapid growth in part-timers’ wages, such cost savings is likely to become increasingly\ndifficult to maintain.\n\nBankof America\n6 Japan Economics Viewpoint | 18 November 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014415",
