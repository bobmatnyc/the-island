  "text": "14 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nmoments — so we have packed them with diagnostic monitoring systems.\nThese systems allow us to watch a computer think and, since they think\nsymbolically, we can easily read their minds.\n\nUnfortunately computers don't display many human-like thoughts.\nThey don’t laugh and cry, they don’t report consciousness and they don't\nappear to exercise free will or display creative impulses. This is frustrating\nbecause these are the thoughts we would most like to study. It might be\nthat computers are not yet powerful enough, and in another few years\nthey will be giving Mozart a run for his money. But there may also be\na fundamental difference which renders them incapable of this sort of\nthinking. This is the crux of the modern scientific debate: do humans\n\nthink differently?\n\nComputer Brains\nOn the face of it, humans and computers behave very differently. Our\nmemories are poor, but we understand things. We are creative, but bad\nat mathematics. We learn by example, computers are programmed.\nWe are emotional, impulsive and appear to have free will. Computers\nare ordered, predictable, but lack common sense. Both humans and\ncomputers appear to be physical, discrete systems. We both take inputs,\ngenerate outputs and are capable of solving similar problems. Indeed,\neach time we examine a problem solved by humans we usually find we\ncan automate it. This is known as ‘knowledge engineering’ and there are\nmany examples; from aerospace to finance, and architecture to medicine.\nAn example of where computers excel is in medical diagnosis.\nISABEL is a clinical diagnosis program designed to help ER doctors\nquickly diagnose critical patients. It was created by the parents of Isabel\nMaude, a little girl who presented with multiple symptoms to an ER unit.\nDoctors were initially confused by the symptoms and misdiagnosed\nher condition. She was later diagnosed with meningitis. Isabel suffered\nmultiple organ failure but survived. Her parents realized there was\nsomething wrong with the ER triage process. They got together with\nsome computer scientists and built the expert system ‘ISABEL. When\nER doctors are presented with symptoms, they must mentally scan a vast\narray of literature to rule in and out possible diagnoses. The problem-\nsolving process is not linear; if you've ever watched the TV series House\nit gives a great dramatization of the process. Certain symptoms might\nsuggest a diagnosis but are not conclusive, and there are many paths to\nexplore. Programmers have taken the heuristic rules from many doctors\nand codified them into software. ISABEL allows a doctor to input a set\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015704",
