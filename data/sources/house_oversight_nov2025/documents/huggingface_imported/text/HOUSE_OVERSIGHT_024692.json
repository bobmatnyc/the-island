Assuming that cannabis-derived drugs will eventually be\npermitted to be sold in the United States, considerable time and expense will be spent by manufac-\nturers to obtain FDA approval and bring approved products to market. There is no guarantee that\ninvestments of significant time and money into research, development and clinical trials will result in\nFDA approval of cannabis products.\n\nProduct Liability Claims. Companies may be exposed to various product liability claims associated\nwith human consumption of cannabis products. Consumer claims that products cause injury or ill-\nness, include inadequate instructions for use or warnings concerning health risks, or cause possible side\neffects or interactions with other substances may be expensive to defend or settle.\n\nConsumer Products Outlook\n\nWe believe that there are significant market opportunities for well-recognized brands to develop in\nvarious categories of consumer products, particularly in flower, concentrates, edibles and vaporizers.\nIn addition, we believe that there are opportunities for companies targeting niche applications for the\npet industry. Many companies will struggle to create strong brands because the consumer products\nsegment generally has low barriers to entry and is currently oversaturated. As the cannabis industry and\nlegal environment develop, we expect that national brands will emerge from companies with large mar-\nketing budgets, operational scale and reputations for quality, and that large alcohol, tobacco, consumer\nproducts and pharmaceutical companies will play a larger role in this segment.\n\n= Business Solutions\n\nThe business solutions segment of the cannabis industry comprises business software, such as seed-\nto-sale tracking solutions, and business services, such as legal, compliance, operational consulting and\nfinancial services. Software and services providers in this segment generally do not “touch the plant”\nand do not require cannabis-related permits or licenses.\n\nBusiness Software\n\nSoftware solutions tailored to the cannabis industry are present throughout the cannabis supply chain.\nAlthough solutions from other manufacturing and retail industries are used in the cannabis industry,\nindustry-specific solutions are emerging as some of the most popular. Some companies provide point\nsolutions that target bottlenecks in the supply chain, while others offer broad platforms that consoli-\ndate multiple capabilities. Industry-specific software applications exist and are being developed in the\nfollowing areas: cultivation cycle management; concentrate production management; infused product\nmanufacturing management; product testing and compliance; retail operations (including point-of-\nsale, inventory, tax reporting and compliance solutions); mobile, e-commerce and delivery applica-\ntions; supply-chain management; customer relationship management; and management reporting and\nbusiness intelligence.\n\n56 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024692",
