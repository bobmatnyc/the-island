  "text": "Murder At the Conspiracy Convention\n\n‘The history of civilization is the history of wartare\nbetween secret societies.” --/shmael Reed\n\nIn the men’ s room at the airport, a man standing at the urinal a\ncouple of urinals away from my urinal was urinating without aiming his\npenis. Both hands were flossing his teeth. A monument to multi-tasking.\nI’ Il admit that | occasionally brush my teeth while I’ m urinating—at least\nthat leaves me with one hand free to steer—but this guy could possibly be\nthe only human being on earth who pisses and flosses simultaneously.\n\nHe must have practiced at home before he decided to go public.\nAnd of course he was proud of his manual dexterity. Maybe he even has a\nlicense plate that says PFLOSS, though other drivers might assume it’ s his\nname, not his avocation. In any case, that image immediately replaced my\nprevious visual mantra: seeing one of the kids on a school bus holding up\nto the window a sign that read HELP US!--and laughing with his\nclassmates.\n\nNow, on Memorial Day weekend, | was catching a flight to San Jose,\nCalifornia. | was headed for Conspiracy Con 2001, a convention featuring\n\nthe prophets of the sinister.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015226",
