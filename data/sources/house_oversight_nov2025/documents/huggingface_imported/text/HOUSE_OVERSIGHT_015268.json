  "text": "books and check my Web site and show up wherever | speak. It’ s a safety\nvalve for them, on how far things are going.”\n\n“Are you saying that the intelligence community has allowed you\nto function because you know more than any of them?\"\n\n“Exactly .. .”\n\nOn my return fight the next morning, | found myself reminiscing\nabout the 1987-88 TV season, when | had been a writer and on-air\ncommentator on 7he Wilton North Report, a nightly satirical hour on the\nFox network that lasted only 21 shows. Critics blamed the hosts, a pair of\ndisc jockeys who were not untalented but who were deliberately chosen\nfor their inoffensiveness.\n\n| had previously suggested as host Conan O’ Brien, a writer on the\nshow who also did the audience warm-ups. “No,” said the producer,\n\n“he’ s not professional enough.” Ellen DeGeneres? “Too dykey.” Chris\nrock? “Too raw.” Rosie O' Donnell? “Who wants to look at her every\nnight?” Richard Belzer? “Too reptilian.” Belzer is a conspiracy researcher\nas well as a comedian and actor, but little did he ever dream that\nultimately he—his reptilian self—could be the culmination of his own\n\ninvestigation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015268",
