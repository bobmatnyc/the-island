This review establishes that the CVRA extends\nrights to crime victims before formal charges are filed.\n\nPart ITI critiques OLC's position that the CVRA extends rights to victims only after prosecutors have lodged charges in court.\nThe Department's proffered arguments do not withstand close scrutiny, particularly in light of the fact that the CVRA covers\nfederal agencies involved in the \"detection\" and \"investigation\" of crime, + and specifically authorizes crime victims to file\nCVRA motions in situations where \"no prosecution is underway.\" >\n\nPart IV then proposes a specific approach for determining when crime victims’ CVRA rights attach. This Part explains that the\nrights should attach when federal law enforcement or prosecuting agencies have identified a federal crime and a particular\nvictim with sufficient precision that they would send a \"target\" letter to a criminal defendant in similar circumstances. If\nprosecutors have sufficient information to provide notice [*63] to a potential criminal of his rights, they can do the same for\nhis victims. This Part also notes that the Department of Justice and state prosecutors already successfully provide rights to\nvictims before charging. This successful experience strongly suggests that providing rights to victims early in the criminal\njustice process will not be unduly burdensome.\n\nI. The Issue of Rights for Crime Victims During Criminal Investigations\n\nTo consider the question of whether victims should have rights during criminal investigations, some understanding of the\nunderlying purposes of victims’ rights enactments will be useful. These enactments are typically designed to make victims\nparticipants in all phases of the criminal justice process. © Congress drafted the CVRA, for example, broadly to make crime\nvictims participants in criminal cases. The Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse case demonstrates the importance of victim participation\neven before charges are filed.\n\nA. ABRIEF HISTORY OF CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS\n\nThe crime victims’ rights movement has sought to make crime victims important participants in the criminal justice process.\nThe movement began in the wake of the Warren Court revolution, which extended new rights to criminal defendants. 7 With\nthe courts paying increasing attention to criminal defendants, crime victims' advocates began to argue that the victims\nthemselves had been overlooked. * The movement gained great visibility in the early 1980s when President Ronald Reagan\nappointed the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime. ? The Task Force published a report concluding that \"the criminal\njustice system has lost an essential balance... . The victims of crime have been transformed into a group oppressively burdened.\nby a system designed to protect them. This oppression must be redressed.”\" 1°\n\nThe Task Force chronicled how crime victims were treated in all stages of the criminal justice process, from the police\ninvestigation through [*64] court proceedings, and ultimately to any parole or other release of the criminal.
