  "text": "According to a few of the attorneys who represented Epstein's victims in the civil cases, the financier\nnever agreed to a psychological evaluation prior to or during his sentence, a requirement of all sexual\npredators.\n\nWhile Epstein's self-incriminating statements are published (this week he told the Post \"the crime that\nwas supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York\" -- an interesting choice of words -- he\ncontinues to mock the law that applies to all other sex offenders who are found guilty of the same crime.\nEpstein served 13 months in the West Palm Beach Stockade and 18 months under community control (a\nrather permissive version of house arrest), for 2 Counts of Solicitation of Prostitution with a Minor.\n\nIn August of 2010, immediately following his release from \"community control\", Epstein returned to his\n$50 million East 71st Street town house given to him by his former client and long time friend Leslie\nWexner.\n\nJust in the last few weeks he held a house warming dinner to celebrate his release from jail and\nreportedly invited television reporters Katie Couric, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulus and his close\nfriend, HRH Prince Andrew, according to the NY Post.\n\nYou would think these professional television reporters would have done their homework prior to\naccepting his invitation no matter how desperate they were to rub elbows with Prince Andrew.\nAccording to a 53-page sealed indictment Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple counts of\nstatutory rape, and child sex trafficking.\n\nCourt documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out girls as young as 14 and paid them $200 to\n$1,000 for sexually explicit massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan.\n\nIn the New York sex-offender database, Epstein isn't registered under a zip code rather a \"name search\"\noption that does not list his New York address.\n\nThe reason for this is because Epstein's Upper East Side home is considered \"temporary\" and by NY state\nlaw, he is required to provide only his permanent address to the database.\n\nEpstein is currently listed under his Florida home even though he is no longer a Florida resident either\n(after his arrest he immediately became a US VI resident), but then again who's keeping count?\n\nOnce again these are mere technicalities when it comes to Epstein's sexual predator case. The two most\ndisturbing parts of this story are that this could easily happen again and that once again there will be no\nJustice.\n\nHad Epstein been a caring benefactor contributing to society and these young girl's education and well\nbeing then the world would have judged him differently.\n\nWhat he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage to hundreds of underage\ngirls who could have been sponsored towards a better education.\n\nWith respect to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, I'm confused by his decision to allow this sexual predator to\nlive at his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun\ncontrol as witnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPost when asked about a Florida driver cleared ina\nManhattan weapon's charge, \"guns brought illegally into New York City\" he said, \" for any reason\nviolate well established state laws and are a threat to our public safety\".\n\nThen wouldn't a registered sex offender living 500 feet from a park (Central Park where young girls\ncongregate), and with resources to spare be an even more dangerous threat to society?\n\nThe Billionaire Pedophile's Sex Den\nby Conchita Sarnoff javascript:void(0)\n\n© javascript: ;javascript:;\ne http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billionaire-and-his-sex-den/full/\ne javascript:void(0)\n\ne javascript:void(0)\ne Email\ne javascript:void(0)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022251",
