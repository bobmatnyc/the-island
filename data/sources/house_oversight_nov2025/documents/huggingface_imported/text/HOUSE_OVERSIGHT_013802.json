Things were about to change.\n\nEverything was about to change.\n\nLifestyle Design from Dubai to Berlin\n\nTie 4-Hour Workweek has now been sold into 35 languages. It’s been on the bestseller lists for more\n\nthan two years, and every month brings a new story and a new discovery.\n\nFrom the Economist to the cover of the New York Times Style section, from the streets of Dubai to the\ncafes of Berlin, lifestyle design has cut across cultures to become a worldwide movement. The original\nideas of the book have been broken apart, improved, and tested in environments and ways I never could\nhave imagined.\n\nSo why the new edition if things are working so well? Because I knew it could be better, and there\nwas a missing ingredient: you.\n\nThis expanded and updated edition contains more than 100 pages of new content, including the latest\ncutting-edge technologies, field-tested resources, and—most important—real-world success stories\nchosen from more than 400 pages of case studies submitted by readers.\n\nFamilies and students’?

On the blog itself, you can also find recommendations from everyone from\nWarren Buffett (seriously, I tracked him down and show you how I did it) to chess prodigy Josh\nWaitzkin. It’s an experimental playground for those who want better results in less time.\n\nNot “Revised”\n\nTris is not a “revised” edition in the sense that the original no longer works. The typos and small\nmistakes have been fixed over more than 40 printings in the U.S. This is the first major overhaul, but not\nfor the reason you’d expect.\n\nThings have changed dramatically since April 2007. Banks are failing, retirement and pension funds\nare evaporating, and jobs are being lost at record rates. Readers and skeptics alike have asked: Can the\nprinciples and techniques in the book really still work in an economic recession or depression?\n\nYes and yes.\n\nIn fact, questions I posed during pre-crash lectures, including “How would your priorities and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013802",
