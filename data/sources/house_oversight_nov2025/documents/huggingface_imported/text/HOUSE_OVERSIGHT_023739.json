As the only child in the\nhouse, I had plenty of time and opportunity to figure out what he was\nreally saying. This was it: I am afraid that like me, the best you will be\nable to do in life is to be a civil service worker. He was also saying: If he\nhad realized he was going to be a civil service worker, at least he could\nhave been a teacher, which he might have enjoyed. He wasn’t really\ntalking about me at all.\n\nI never had any intention of being a teacher. I didn’t particularly\nlike school and later, when I became a professor, the part of the job I\ndisliked the most was the teaching. One might wonder how I wound\nup being a professor if I disliked teaching, and one might wonder why\nTam writing a book about teaching if I dislike teaching. One also might\nwonder whether I still dislike teaching. Yes. And no. It depends on what\none means by teaching, which is, after all, what this book is about.\n\nThe other day my 3-year-old grandson Milo told me he was going\nto teach me how to throw rocks. It seemed an odd idea. What could he\nmean by this? To Milo, “teach” means to tell someone what to do and\nhow to do it and then have the person do it too. Teach is part of tell\nplus imitate for Milo. Milo is 3. It is not too surprising that this is what\nteach means to him. It is a little surprising that he thinks he should\nbe his grandfather’s teacher, but that is another issue. But it is really\nno shock that Milo thinks this is what teach means. It is what nearly\neveryone thinks teach means. The commonly accepted usage of teach\nis tell and then have the person who was told, do what he was told.\nThis certainly is not what teach ought to mean, or more important, is\nnot what good teaching is. And, every good teacher knows this. The\nproblem is that the system that employs teachers doesn’t know it and\nmore or less insists that Milo’s definition be the one that is followed.\n\nActually, Iam being too generous here. Milo’s view, namely, that\nafter he tells me, I will do what he has said, is a better definition of\n\ni\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023739",
