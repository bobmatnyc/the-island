  "text": "about the murder of President Kennedy. Haldeman said that Nixon always\nreferred to the assassination as “the Bay of Pigs.” And, on May 5, 1977,\nthe Houston Post published a UPI dispatch that stated:\n\n“Watergate burglar Frank Sturgis said Wednesday that the CIA\nplanned the break-in because high officials felt Richard Nixon was\nbecoming too powerful and was overly interested in the assassination of\nJohn Kennedy... ‘Several times the President asked CIA director Richard\nHelms for the files on the Kennedy assassination, but Helms refused to\ngive them to him, refused a direct order from the President,’ Sturgis said.\n\n‘| believe Nixon would have uncovered the true facts in the assassination\nof President Kennedy and that would have taken off the heat in Watergate.\nBecause Nixon wanted files, the CIA felt they had to get rid of him.’\nAsked if Nixon ever was in danger, Sturgis replied, ‘Yes, absolutely. Nixon\nwas lucky he wasn’ t killed—assassinated like President Kennedy.’ ”\n\nOne other thing. “A Sneak Preview of Richard Nixon’ s Memoir\"\nwas originally published in 1976, in which Nixon insisted that Watergate\nwas a set-up to get rid of him as president. About a decade later, Tricky\nDick made that exact same claim on a network television interview.\n\nSatirical prophecy in action.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015131",
