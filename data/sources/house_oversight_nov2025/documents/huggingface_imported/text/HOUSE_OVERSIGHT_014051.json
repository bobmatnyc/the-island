  "text": "72 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\nrespect for the victim’s dignity and privacy,”°’ a broad right that does not\nappear to be directly linked to a filed court case. Similarly, the CVRA\npromises victims the “reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the\nGovernment in the case.”**® In this section, the CVRA’s drafters appear to\nhave eschewed a reference to court proceedings, using a broader term\ninstead. Of course, a “case” can refer both to a judicial case before a court\nand an investigative case pursued by a law enforcement officer. It is\ncommon usage to say such things as, “The police officer investigated and\nsolved the case.” Dictionary definitions of the word “case” support this\nvaried interpretation.”\n\nIf there remained any doubts about whether the CVRA applies during\nthe investigative part of the criminal justice process, two other provisions in\nthe CVRA resolve them. The CVRA specifically directs that “[o|fficers\nand employees of the Department of Justice and other departments and\nagencies of the United States engaged in the defection, investigation, or\nprosecution of crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims\nare notified of, and accorded, the rights described in [the CVRA].’°° Of\ncourse, there would be no reason to direct that agencies involved in the\n“detection” and “investigation” of crime have CVRA obligations if the Act\ndid not extend to pre-charging situations. Congress thus directly envisioned\nthe victims’ rights law to apply during the “detection” and “investigation”\nphases of criminal cases.\n\nSimilarly, the CVRA’s venue provision instructs that crime victims\nwho seek to assert rights in pre-charging situations should proceed in the\ncourt where the crime was committed: “The rights described in subsection\n(a) [of the CVRA] shall be asserted in the district court in which a\ndefendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if no prosecution is\nunderway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred.”*!\nHere again, it is hard to see why this provision would be necessary unless\nthe CVRA applies before the formal filing of charges.\n\nFor all these reasons, the CVRA’s plain language indicates that the\nvictims have protected rights under the Act even before charges are filed.\n\n7 Td. § 3771 (ay(8).\n\n%8 Td. § 3771(a)(5) (emphasis added).\n\n»° See, e.g., BLack’s Law Dictionary 243-44 (9th ed. 2009) (defining, among the\ndefinitions of “case,” a “test case” as “[a] criminal investigation” as in “the Manson case”);\nWEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE\nUNABRIDGED 345 (1993) (defining “case” as “a circumstance or situation (as a crime)\nrequiring investigation or action by the police or other agency”).\n\n6 18 US.C. § 3771(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n\n6! Td. § 3771(d)(3) (emphasis added).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014051",
