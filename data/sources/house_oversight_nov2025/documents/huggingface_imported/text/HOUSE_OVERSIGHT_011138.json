The\n\nsubscript s, as usual, means saved or self-invested.\n\nPay z can be defined as the worker’s literal or imputed revenue. Self-invested\n\nconsumption C_ can be defined as any investment in human capital other than\n\nthrough self-invested work. This makes C, all investment from outside in a sense.\n\nBut that does not mean that it is limited to transfer in. There is also plowback from\n\nrevenue (pay 7 ), as when we spend pay on textbooks or tuition. I model “pay\nplowback” 7, as minor in the world we know, but definitions must account for it.\n\nThis I define\n\nC.=(H) +m, or t(H) =C,-7,, (A5.2)\n\nwhere t(H)_ is “human transfer in”.
