  "text": "KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\n\nMEME. at 6, 8, 22, 45; Tab 7, MEE. 13; Tab SIN Tr. at 8; Tab 9, NNN Tr. at 5; and\nTab 10, J Tr. at 14-15 (excerpts from these transcripts are included below). Furthermore,\nthe women who visited Mr. Epstein’s home all visited voluntarily and many willingly returned\nseveral times.\n\nThe State Attorney’s Office (the “SAO”) has vast experience prosecuting sex crimes and\nconducted an exhaustive, 15-month investigation of Mr. Epstein. A Grand Jury has concluded\nthat Mr. Epstein was merely a local “John,” guilty of soliciting prostitution in violation of state\nlaw. Notably, Florida law distinguishes soliciting from procuring and compelling prostitution if\nminors are involved. Indeed, soliciting is a misdemeanor except for the commission of a third\nsubsequent offense, turning it into a felony. The SAO, therefore, sought and obtained an\nindictment charging Mr. Epstein with felony solicitation of prostitution. Mr. Epstein is prepared\nto plead guilty and accept a sentence for that offense—a sentence that, notably, is far more\nsevere than that meted out to other “Johns” convicted of violating Florida’s solicitation laws for\ncases in which sexual activity was alleged.\n\nThough CEOS points out its admirable goal of “protecting children,” a moniker that\nengenders high emotions, the conduct alleged here involves women over 16, which is the age of\nconsent in 38 states and supplies the effective federal age of consent. The young women were by\nno means the target of high-school trolling; they were individuals who, with friends, visited Mr.\nEpstein’s house—a home full of friends and staff. The civil complaints filed against Mr. Epstein\nreiterate the fact that the individuals who visited Mr. Epstein would visit with their friends. And\nMr. Epstein never spoke to or had any contact with these women before they arrived at his\nhouse. And again, the State is handling this matter appropriately.\n\nWe respectfully submit that that should be the beginning and the end of this matter. As\nyou know, the Department’s Petite Policy precludes successive federal prosecutions after a State\nhas acted: “{A] state judgment of conviction, plea agreement [here held in abeyance solely as a\nresult of the federal investigation], or acquittal on the merits shall be a bar to any subsequent\nfederal prosecution for the same act or acts.” U.S.A.M. § 9-2.031A (emphasis added).\nConsistent with that principle, and of particular relevance to this case, the Department itself just\nrecently observed the following:\n\n[P]rostitution-related offenses have historically been prosecuted at the state or\nlocal level. This allocation between state and Federal enforcement authority does\nnot imply that these crimes are less serious, but rather reflects important structural\nallocations of responsibility between state and Federal governments.... [T]he\nDepartment is not aware of any reasons why state and local authorities are not\ncurrently able to pursue prostitution-related crimes such that Federal jurisdiction -\nis necessary.\n\nSee Tab 11, November 9, 2007 Letter from Justice Department Principal Deputy Assistant\nAttorney General Brian Benczkowski to the House Committee on the Judiciary, p. 8-9.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012144",
