  "text": "bother you most. The war-or-peace dilemmas of foreign policy are an essential case\n— when they go wrong, they hammer all of us. And we can see in the ripples of global\npower ideas that are of use in nearly any sphere. How, for instance, to fight a\nnetwork. The struggle of JIEDDO is, in a sense, similar to something all of us face\nnow: Old vs. new. In any event, in the case of the IEDs, here was the most powerful\nnation in human history, backed by hypersonic missiles, always-on radars, and\nendless jet fuel that found itself unable to stop a group of half-educated and\npromiscuously backwards terrorists. You had to ask: What was wrong? And did the\nfailure suggest something even deeper about the position of the dominant national\npower of the era? About the nature of our age?\n\n3.\n\nA few days before Christmas of December of 1787, Thomas Jefferson sat down in\nParis to write a letter to James Madison.*? Madison was on the other side of the\nAtlantic, in Philadelphia, and struggling with refinements to the new American\nconstitution, which had been drafted in the spring and summer just passed. The two\nmen were frequent correspondents. They wrote to each other with an easy\nfamiliarity, revolutionary to revolutionary. Jefferson was then 44, and had settled\nhungrily into his role as the American minister in France, “violently smitten,” as he\nwrote, by the charms of The Continent*+. Madison was 36, twenty years removed\nfrom the election of 1808 that would elevate him to the Presidency as Jefferson’s\nsuccessor. Madison would become, in a sense, America’s first “Foreign Policy”\nPresident, prosecuting the war of 1812 and negotiating with France for the\nLouisiana Purchase. He was known already, in 1787, as “The Father of the\nConstitution.”\n\nJefferson begins his letter with a few of the charming literary asides we expect from\nhim: He asks Madison about some nuns he wants to help teach his children, inquires\nafter about a packet of carefully chosen South Carolina rice that has gone missing in\nthe oceanic post, delaying his plans to impress French palates with an American\ncrop. But then Jefferson turns to what he knows must be on Madison’s mind, the\nnew constitution. “I like much the general idea of framing a government which\nshould go on of itself peaceably,” he says, admiring the elegant balance that emerges\nso carefully from the pages of the document. The American constitution, Jefferson\nfelt, reflected political arrangements new in the history of human governance,\nbetween people and power, between states and the center, between agriculture and\ncommerce. He is, he says, “capitaved” by the details of what he has seen.\n\n43 A few days before Christmas: Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, The\nRepublic of Letters: The Correspondence between Thomas Jefferson and James\nMadison, 1776-1826, (New York: Norton, 1995) Vol 1. pp, 457-459\n\n44 Jefferson was then 44: Thomas Jefferson and Douglas L.
