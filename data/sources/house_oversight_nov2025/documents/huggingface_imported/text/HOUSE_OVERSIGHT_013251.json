  "text": "Glossary of Specialized Terms 335\n\nKnowledge Base: A shorthand for the totality of knowledge possessed by an intelligent\nsystem during a certain interval of time (whether or not this knowledge is explicitly rep-\nresented). Put differently: this is an intelligence’s total memory contents (inclusive of all\ntypes of memory) during an interval of time.\n\nLanguage Comprehension: The process of mapping natural language speech or text into\na more “cognitive”, largely language-independent representation. In OpenCog this has been\ndone by various pipelines consisting of dedicated natural language processing tools, e.g. a\npipeline: text — Link Parser — RelEx > RelEx2Frame — Frame2Atom Atomspace; and\nalternatively a pipeline Link Parser > Link2Atom — Atomspace. It would also be possi-\nble to do language comprehension purely via PLN and other generic OpenCog processes,\nwithout using specialized language processing tools.\n\nLanguage Generation: The process of mapping (largely language-independent) cognitive\ncontent into speech or text. In OpenCog this has been done by various pipelines consisting of\ndedicated natural language processing tools, e.g. a pipeline: Atomspace > NLGen — text;\nor more recently Atomspace — Atom2Link — surface realization — text. It would also be\npossible to do language generation purely via PLN and other generic OpenCog processes,\nwithout using specialized language processing tools.\n\nLanguage Processing: Processing of human language is decomposed, in CogPrime, into\nLanguage Comprehension, Language Generation, and Dialogue Control.\n\nLearning: In general, the process of a system adapting based on experience, in a way that\nincreases its intelligence (its ability to achieve its goals). The theory underlying CogPrime\ndoesn’t distinguish learning from reasoning, associating, or other aspects of intelligence.\nLearning Server: In some OpenCog configurations, this refers to a software server that\nperforms “offline” learning tasks (e.g. using MOSES or hillclimbing), and is in communica-\ntion with an Operational Agent Controller software server that performs real-time agent\ncontrol and dispatches learning tasks to and receives results from the Learning Server.\nLinguistic Links: A catch-all term for Atoms explicitly representing linguistic content,\ne.g. WordNode, SentenceNode, CharacterNode.\n\nLink: A type of Atom, representing a relationship among one or more Atoms. Links and\nNodes are the two basic kinds of Atoms.\n\nLink Parser: A natural language syntax parser, created by Sleator and Temperley at\nCarnegie-Mellon University, and currently used as part of OpenCogPrime’s natural language\ncomprehension and natural language generation system.\n\nLink2Atom: A system for translating link parser links into Atoms. It attempts to resolve\nprecisely as much ambiguity as needed in order to translate a given assemblage of link parser\nlinks into a unique Atom structure.\n\nLobe: A term sometimes used to refer to a portion of a distributed Atomspace that lives\nin a single computational process. Often different lobes will live on different machines.\nLocalized Memory: Memory that stores each item using a small number of closely-\nconnected elements.\n\nLogic: In an OpenCog context, this usually refers to a set of formal rules for translating\ncertain combinations of Atoms into “conclusion” Atoms. The paradigm case at present is the\nPLN probabilistic logic system, but OpenCog can also be used together with other logics.\nLogical Links: Any Atoms whose truth values are primarily determined or adjusted via\nlogical rules, e.g. PLN’s InheritanceLink, SimilarityLink, ImplicationLink, etc. The term\nisn’t usually applied to other links like HebbianLinks whose semantics isn’t primarily logic-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013251",
