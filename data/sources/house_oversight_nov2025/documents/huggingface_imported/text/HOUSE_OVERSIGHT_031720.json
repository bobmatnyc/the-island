  "text": "legacy of the Iranian revolution that established a state rooted in\nreligion.\n\nNow, nearly four decades old, the Revolutionary Guard’s rise to power\nremains the catalyst for Islamic sectarian division today, releasing\nforces of fury once confined first by Ottoman rule and then by US\ndominance in the region. The threat to Arab nations and the West that\nensued is the same as that led by the Ottomans: the spread of a radical\nIslamic caliphate based on religion, not country. In Iran, this is credo\nis championed by the Revolutionary Guard and an Ayatollah who\nlectures two billion Muslims that he is an infallible ruler directly\nresponsible to God. US diplomats are faced with an impossible\nbalancing act: limiting nuclear proliferation and, at the same time,\nfirmly standing against the religious intolerance fanning Islamic\nterrorism.\n\nThe outbreak of these historically opposing forces, compounded by\ndeclining oil prices, is heightening the ferment.\n\nThe Arab World’s best hope is the rise of a new generation in\ngovernment. In the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, brilliant young\nleaders are crafting forward-looking policies to effectively forge a new\nMiddle East. American foreign policy must persuade these bold\nvisionaries to lean West rather than East. This endeavor will not\nsimply benefit the nations they lead. It’s the most effective strategy to\nsafeguard America’s interests. By supporting their anti-terrorism\nplatforms abroad, America enhances its anti-terrorism policies at\nhome.\n\nLike Asian rulers who launched the Tiger Economies of the mid to late\n20th century, these new Arab leaders are searching for policies aimed\nat economic and educational development. Those policies are designed\nto reduce internal tensions and secure their countries’ rightful place in\na future dominated by global trade.
