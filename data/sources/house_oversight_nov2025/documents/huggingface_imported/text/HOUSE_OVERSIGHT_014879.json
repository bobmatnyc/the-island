On a ‘risked’ basis, we believe this is a reasonable\ndevelopment scenario representative of any incremental discovery that resembles Liza\nrecalling that the partners have identified over 20 additional drilling prospects. On the\nassumption of a ‘plus three year’ development scenario after Liza, the potential impact\non incremental production and cash flow is significant for Hess while the cumulative\nimpact also becomes significant for XOM.\n\nThe charts below show our latest assessment of how a compound timeline for a Liza /\nPayara development could look, if Payara as a project does indeed prove to be a look\n\nalike to Liza.\nExhibit 9: Hess theoretical production profile for Liza / Payara Exhibit 10: Hess net production profile (by phase)\n300 60 -\n2a0) 50 4\n200 40 4\n150 30 +\n100 20 4\n50 10 4\n; 2016 A018 2020 2022 2024 2016 2021 2026 2031 |\nMlizaEardyPS omLizaPhase? wm Liza Phase} ——LizaEalyPS m—LizaPhase2 ——LizaPhase3\n@ Payera Early PS @ Payera Phase ? § Payera Phase 3 —— Payara Early PS ——=Payara Phase 2 —=Payara Phase 3\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\n\nCritically, Guyana is now being described as a ‘DHI play’ meaning seismic and core have\nbeen sufficiently calibrated as to provide direct hydrocarbon indicators and hence de-\nrisking future exploration tests. This appears confirmed again by the latest ‘Snoek’\nSUCCESS.\n\nXOM’s development plan calls for an FPSO (floating production and storage offloading\nvessel} with production capacity of about 150,000 boepd for every 450mm barrels of\nrecoverable reserves, with plateau production extending up to 10 years. We suggest\nmanagement’s commentary supports gross production capacity from current discovered\nresource of at least 600,000 boepd.\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Hess Corp. | 11 April 2017 7\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014879",
