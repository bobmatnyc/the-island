The reality is that guilty (as well as some innocent\nclients) don’t trust their lawyers with their deep, dark secrets. Most believe that their lawyer will\nwork harder for innocent defendants than for guilty ones, so they lie through their teeth.\n\nThey claim, especially at the beginning of their relationship with their lawyer, that they are the\ntotally innocent victims of a horrible injustice. They admit nothing. In order to get some sense of\nwhat actually happened, I ask them the following question:\n\n“If your worst enemy, the person behind this horrible injustice, were to testify against you,\nwhat lies would he testify to? What would he say you did?”\n\nThe answer they give often comes close to what really happened. In this way, I obtain a working\nknowledge—always subject to reevaluation based on new evidence—of what may have occurred,\nwithout directly accusing my new client of being a liar.\n\nOnly one client who was accused of a killing has admitted to me that he was guilty. He really had\nno choice, since the very fact of his guilt was an essential element of his defense. The case was a\nstrange one from beginning to end. Not only was my client guilty of having participated in a\ncrime that resulted in the death of a young woman, he also—it turned out—was a government\ninformant who was providing information to the police as to what he and his group were doing.\n\nI have related this story in detail in Zhe Best Defense and will not repeat it here, except to\ndescribe how it feels to win a case on behalf of an admittedly guilty defendant. Not only did he\ngo free as the result of our legal arguments, but all of his co-conspirators—the ones who actually\nplanted the smoke bomb that suffocated the woman—went free as well. (My client, who was an\nengineer, had constructed the smoke bomb, knowing that it was going to be placed in a crowded\narea.)\n\nWhen I first undertook the pro bono representation of Sheldon Siegel, he faced a possible death\nsentence. I had no idea that he was informing against his colleagues in the Jewish Defense\nLeague at the same time that he was making bombs for them. Informers are a peculiar lot, often\nundecided about which side they are on—other than their own side. Siegel was committed to the\nideology of the JDL, including their sometime use of violence to make their point. But he was\nalso desirous of protecting his own head and he knew he was vulnerable to prosecution for the\nbombs he had constructed that had been used against Soviet targets in the United States. He\nhoped to avoid prosecution by providing the government with selective information about his JDL\ncolleagues and their plans. He also hoped the JDL would never find out that he was playing both\nsides against the middle.\n\nOne of their plans—to plant a smoke bomb in the office of Sol Hurok, a Jewish impresario who\n\nbrought musicians to the United States from the Soviet Union—went awry and a young Jewish\nwoman named Iris Kones died from inhaling smoke from a bomb that was intended to disrupt but\n\n215\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017302",
