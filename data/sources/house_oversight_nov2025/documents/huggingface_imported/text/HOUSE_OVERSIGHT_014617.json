For example,\ninvestments that involve futures, equity\nswaps, and other derivatives, as well\nas non-investment grade securities,\ngive rise to substantial risk and are not\navailable to or suitable for all investors.\nWe have described some of the risks\nassociated with certain investments\nbelow. Additional information regarding\nrisks may be available in the materials\nprovided in connection with specific\ninvestments. You should not enter into\na transaction or make an investment\nunless you understand the terms of\n\nthe transaction or investment and the\nnature and extent of the associated\nrisks. You should also be satisfied that\nthe investment is appropriate for you in\nlight of your circumstances and financial\ncondition.\n\nAltemative investments. Alternative\ninvestments may involve a substantial\ndegree of risk, including the risk of total\nloss of an investor's capital and the use\nof leverage, and therefore may not be\nappropriate for all investors. Private\nequity, private real estate, hedge funds\nand other alternative investments\nstructured as private investmen\nfunds are subject to less regulation\n\nthan other types of pooled vehicles\n\nand liquidity may be limited. Investors\n\nin private investment funds should\nreview the Offering Memorandum,\n\nthe Subscription Agreement and any\nother applicable disclosures for risks\nand potential conflicts of interest.\nTerms and conditions governing private\ninvestments are contained in the\napplicable offering documents, which\nalso include information regarding the\nliquidity of such investments, which may\nbe limited.\n\nCommodities. Commodity investments\nmay be less liquid and more volatile than\nother investments. The risk of loss in\ntrading commodities can be substantial\ndue, but not limited to, volatile political,\nmarket and economic conditions. An\ninvestor's returns may change radically\nat any time since commodities are\nsubject, by nature, to abrupt changes\n\nin price. Commodity prices are volatile\necause they respond to many\nunpredictable factors including weather,\nabor strikes, inflation, foreign exchange\nrates, etc. In an individual account,\necause your position is leveraged, a\nsmall move against your position may\nresult in a large loss. Losses may be\narger than your initial deposit. Investors\nshould carefully consider the inherent\nrisk of such an investment in light of\nheir experience, objectives, financial\nresources and other circumstances. No\nrepresentation is made regarding the\nsuitability of commodity investments.\n\nCurrencies. Currency exchange rates\ncan be extremely volatile, particularly\nduring times of political or economic\nuncertainty. There is a risk of loss when\nan investor as exposure to foreign\ncurrency or are in foreign currency\ntraded investments.\n\nEmerging Markets and Growth Markets.\nInvesting in the securities of issuers in\nemerging markets and growth markets\ninvolves certain considerations,\nincluding: political and economic\nconditions, the potential difficulty\n\nof repatriating funds or enforcing\ncontractual or other legal rights, and\nthe small size of the securities markets\nin such countries coupled with a low\nvolume of trading, resulting in potential\nlack of liquidity and in price volatility.\n\nEquity investments. Equity investments\nare subject to market risk, which means\nthat the value of the securities may go\n\nup or down in respect to the prospects\nof individual companies, particular\nindustry sectors and/or general\neconomic conditions. The securities of\nsmall and mid-capitalization companies\ninvolve greater risks than those\nassociated with larger, more established\ncompanies and may be subject to more\nabrupt or erratic price movements.\n\nFixed Income. Investments in fixed\nincome securities are subject to the\nrisks associated with debt securities\ngenerally, including credit/default,\nliquidity and interest rate risk. Any\nguarantee on an investment grade bond\nof a given country applies only if held\n\nto maturity.\n\nNon-US Securities. Investing in non-US\nsecurities involves the risk of loss\n\nas a result of more or less non-US\ngovernment regulation, less public\ninformation, less liquidity and greater\nvolatility in the countries of domicile\nof the issuers of the securities and/\n\nor the jurisdiction in which these\nsecurities are traded. In addition,\ninvestors in securities such as ADRs/\nGDRs, whose values are influenced by\nforeign currencies, effectively assume\ncurrency risk.\n\nTactical Tilts. Tactical tilts may involve\na high degree of risk. No assurance can\nbe made that profits will be achieved\nor that substantial losses will not be\nincurred. Prior to investing, investors\nmust determine whether a particular\ntactical tiltis suitable for them.\n\nTax Information. Goldman Sachs does\nnot provide legal, tax or accounting\nadvice.
