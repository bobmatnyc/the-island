  "text": "Economics. They made Saddam Hussein one of the 10 wealthiest people\nin the world. Besides, sanctions create sanctions-busting which, like drugs,\nis a global criminal industry born entirely of the idiocy of western\ndiplomacy.\n\nA year ago the Foreign Office defended yet another round of sanctions\nagainst Tehran on the grounds they would \"hasten Iran's economic\n\ncollapse and deepen rifts within the regime, in the hope that saner voices\nwill deem the price of pursuing nuclear weapons too high\". Economies\ndon't collapse, any more than poverty changes governments. Even Greece,\nnow the most \"sanctioned\" nation in Europe, has not collapsed. Places just\nget poorer. As for \"saner voices\", they go into exile, hiding or prison.\nThat's where sanctions send them.\n\nIran is a proud nation of 80 million mostly Muslim people, one of many\nAsian and African states struggling between theocracy and democracy,\ntradition and modernity. These are agonising struggles among and within\npeoples, to which the west has contributed nothing but hostility and\nbelligerence. Under the cloak of \"counter-terror\", it has been as crass as it\nwas during the Crusades. Of course no one wants to see nuclear weapons\nspread. Russia tried to stop China getting them. China tried to stop North\nKorea. The west tried to stop India and Pakistan, while hypocritically\ntolerating Israel and the replenished arsenals of France and Britain. No\npressure made the slightest difference to anyone.\n\nIf Iran really wants a nuclear weapon, it will get one — the more so when it\nis threatened with dire retribution if it does. That is how such states react\nto pressure. Ever since the dodgy election of 2009, threats and sanctions\nhave not weakened the regime's determination to proceed, but rather\nweakened opposition to it. If ever there was a country unlikely to respond\nto diplomatic bullying, it is Iran. If ever there was a country that might\nrespond to constructive engagement, to commercial, governmental and\ncultural intercourse, it is also Iran. Why the west should want to make it\nanother North Korea passes comprehension.\n\nArticle 3.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028653",
