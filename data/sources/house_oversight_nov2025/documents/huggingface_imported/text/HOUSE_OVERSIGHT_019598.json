  "text": "110 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\ntary, the hero of the 2016 Hollywood movie Snowden (directed by\nOliver Stone), and a consultant to the 2015 season of the televi-\nsion series Homeland. He would be nominated for the Nobel Peace\nPrize in 2014. He would attract over one million followers to his\ntweets in 2015. “For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mis-\nsion’s already accomplished. I already won,” he informed the Post\nin his first live interview in Moscow in December 2013. It was a\nmission that involved a very high-stakes enterprise: taking not only\ndomestic surveillance documents but America’s military and foreign\nintelligence secrets abroad.\n\nWhistle-blowers do not ordinarily steal military secrets. Nor do\nthey flee to the territory of America’s principal adversaries. A fugi-\ntive, especially one lacking a Russian visa, does not wind up in Mos-\ncow by pure accident. It’s hard to imagine that a Russian president\nwith the KGB background of Putin would give his personal sanction\nfor a high-profile exfiltration from Hong Kong without weighing\nthe gain that might proceed from it. Whatever else may be said of\nPutin, his actions show him to be a calculating opportunist. Part of\n\n© his calculus would be that the defector from American intelligence ©\nhad taken possession of a great number of potentially valuable docu-\nments from the inner sanctum of the NSA and, aside from these\ndocuments, claimed to hold secrets of great importance in his head.\nTo be sure, the practical value of this stolen archive would require\na lengthy evaluation by Russia’s other intelligence services. But it\nis hard to believe that a defector who put himself in the hands of\nthe FSB, the successor to the KGB, and other Russian intelligence\nservices wouldn't be expected to cooperate with them. Even if such\na defector did not carry these files with him to Moscow, intelligence\nservices have the means to recover digital files, even after they are\nerased from a computer or if they are sent to the cloud. Moreover,\nonce secret documents are taken, they are compromised. Yet for\nmuch of the American public, Snowden remained a hero.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 110 ® 9/29/16 5:51PM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019598",
