Two musicians steeped in Delta blues will produce very\ndifferent music from one musician with a love for soul and funk and another with roots in\nhip-hop or 1980s hardcore. This process involves communication of likes and dislikes\nand preferences, not a series of proposals that meet with acceptance or rejection.\n\n... Under this model, the sexual interaction should be creative, positive, and respectful\neven in the most casual of circumstances.\n\n(\"Towards a Performance Model of Sex\" was first printed in Yes Means Yes, edited by\nJessica Valenti and Jaclyn Friedman, the brilliant sex-positive anti-rape anthology that I\nwant everyone in the entire world to read. It was also reprinted in Best Sex Writing 2010,\nedited by Rachel Kramer Bussel.)\n\n9) All people deserve equal rights, including sexual minorities. As long as people are\nhaving consensual sex, they do not deserve to be stigmatized, harassed, or otherwise\nharmed for their sexuality. Period. No one should be fired for their sexual or gender\nidentity. No one should have their kids taken away for their sexual or gender identity.\nRape is still rape, even when it's perpetrated against a sex worker. I support\ndecriminalizing sex work for a lot of reasons; for example, I'd love it if the law would\nquit harassing and jailing sex workers for having consensual sex, and I'd love it if sex\nworkers could organize for better workplace safety. The bottom line is that people -- all\npeople -- have rights. It's time to treat them that way.\n\nKK Ok\n\nIn terms of actual ways to be sex-positive in everyday life, here are the three ways I\nusually encourage people to spread the sex-positive love:\n\nA) Avoid re-centering. Sexuality shouldn't be societally \"centered\" on any particular\nnorm, idea, or stereotype (except consent). It is frequently tempting to re-center\n\"objective\" ideas about sexuality onto ourselves, if we're different from the norm, or onto\npeople we admire. But the truth is that -- on a societal level -- queer sex is just as\nawesome as straight sex; that BDSM sex is equally admirable as vanilla sex; that\ncisgendered people are not any more or less amazing than trans people. The decision to\nhave sex is no better than the decision to avoid sex, and asexual people are just as great as\nhypersexual people who are just as great as anyone with any level of sex drive.\n\nIn alternative sexuality subcultures, one often encounters a kind of superior attitude,\nperhaps because we have to push back so hard against the norm. In polyamory, for\nexample, some of us use the sarcastic term \"polyvangelist\": a person who insists that\npolyamory is \"better\" or \"more evolved\" or \"makes more sense\" for everyone,\neverywhere, than monogamy does. Neither monogamy nor polyamory is better than the\nother; they're just different. Polyvangelists are trying to re-center onto polyamory. Not\ncool.\n\nB) Start conversations. One of the most damaging problems around sexuality is the\noverwhelming and constant stigma. It hurts people with certain sexual identities,\npreferences or pasts. It hurts them spiritually. It can hurt them societally, like when\nLGBTQ folks have difficulty adopting children, or former sex workers are not allowed to\nwork at other jobs. It can even hurt them physically: 40 years after doctors started\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018486",
