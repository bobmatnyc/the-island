  "text": "Like Senster, the apparatus stimulated (and simulated) an affective rather than\nrational interaction. Humans felt they were encountering behaviors indicative of\nresponsive life; Tsai’s entities were often classed as “vegetal” or “aquatic.” Such\nenvironmental and kinetic ambitions were widespread in the international art world of the\ntime. Beyond the stable at Howard Wise, there were the émigrés forming the collective\nGRAV in Paris, the “cybernetic architectures” of Nicolas Schoffer, the light and plastic\ngyrations of the German Zero Gruppe, and so on—all defining and informing the genre\nof installation art to come.\n\nThe artistic use of cybernetic beings in the late sixties made no investment in\n“intelligence.” Knowing machines were dumb and incapable of emotion, these creators\nwere confident in staging frank simulations. What interested them were machinic\nmotions evoking drives, instincts, and affects; they mimicked sexual and animal\nbehaviors, as if below the threshold of consciousness. Such artists were uninterested in\nthe manipulation of data or information (although Hans Haacke would move in that\ndirection by 1972 with his “Real-Time Systems” works). The cybernetic culture that\nartists and scientists were putting in place on two continents embedded the human in the\ntechnosphere and seduced perception with the graceful and responsive behaviors of the\nmachinic phylum. “Artificial” and “natural” intertwined in this early cybernetic\naesthetic.\n\nBut it wouldn’t end here. Crucial to the expansion of this uncritical, largely\nmasculine set of cybernetic environments would be a radical, critical cohort of\nastonishing women artists emerging in the 1990s, fully aware of their predecessors in art\nand technology but perhaps more inspired by the feminist founders of the 1970 journal\nRadical Software and the cultural blast of Donna Haraway’s inspiring 1984 polemic, “A\nCyborg Manifesto.” The creaky gender theater of Paik and Pask, the innocent creatures\nof Ihnatowicz and Tsai, were mobilized as savvy, performative, and postmodern, as in\nLynn Hershman Leeson’s Dollie Clone Series (1995-98) consisting of the interactive\nassemblages CyberRoberta and Tillie, the Telerobotic Doll, who worked the\ntechnosphere with the professionalism of burlesque, winking and folding us viewers into\nan explicit consciousness of our voyeuristic position as both seeing subjects and objects-\nto-be-looked-at.\n\nThe “innocent” technosphere established by male cybernetic sculptors of the\n1960s was, by the 1990s, identified by feminist artists as an entirely suffusive condition\ndemanding our critical attention. At the same time, feminists tackled the question of\nwhose “intelligence” AI was attempting to simulate. For an artist such as Hershman\nLeeson, responding to the technical “triumph” of cloning Dolly the sheep, it was crucial\nto draw the connection between meat production and “meat machines.” Hershman\nLeeson produced “dolls” as clones, offering a critical framing of the way contemporary\nindividuation had become part of an ideological, replicative, plastic realm.\n\nWhile the technofeminists of the 1990s and into the 2000s weren’t all cyber all\nthe time, their works nonetheless complicated the dominant machinic and kinetic\nqualities of male artists’ previous techno-environments. The androgynous tele-cyborg in\nJudith Barry’s Imagination, Dead Imagine (1991), for example, had no moving parts:\nHe/she was comprised of pure signals, flickering projections on flat surfaces. In her\nsetup, Barry commented on the alienating effects of late-20th-century technology. The\nimage of an androgynous head fills an enormous cube made of ten-foot-square screens on\n\n177\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016980",
