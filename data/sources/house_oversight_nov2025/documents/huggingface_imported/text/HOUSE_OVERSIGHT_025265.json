  "text": "Japanese equities\n\nPreference: neutral\n\nTopix (24 Oct): 743 (last publication: 743)\n\nUBS view Topix (6-month target): 756\n\ne We expect earnings growth of about 25% over the upcoming 12 months. A relatively high growth rate\nstill reflects last year's sharp decline caused by two natural disasters. Still, the earnings recovery has\ndisappointed so far. Earnings growth continues to slow down and is expected to move toward a more\nnormal single-digit growth in 2013.\n\n¢ The government started implementing its JPY 18 trillion recovery budget in Q4 2011; we expect it to\nboost GDP by 0.5-1.0% in FY2012, and about 0.5% in 2013.\n\ne However, we see only limited scope for an additional earnings boost from the local economic recovery.\nSlowing export markets also curtail the outlook. June quarter-earnings results revealed emerging market\ndemand was below expectation, capping earnings growth.\n\ne We expect the TOPIX trailing P/E to drop to around 13.5x from 15.0x over the coming months, mainly due\nto the earnings recovery; this provides room for moderate price increases only.\n\nA Positive scenario Topix (6-month target): 970\n\n¢ Stronger global demand and stabilizing European markets lead to improved risk-taking. Falling risk\naversion is likely to lead to a weaker yen, providing an additional increase in earnings. We expect 10-15%\nEPS growth in FY2013 and the TOPIX target is based on 16.0x trailing P/E.\n\n& Negative scenario Topix (6-month target): 575\n\n¢ Faltering global growth leads to weak exports, triggering negative earnings surprises. USD-JPY rate\nstrengthening to below 75 and potential economic conflicts with China might serve as an additional drag\n\non earnings. We would then expect the P/E ratio to contract to 13.0x and earnings to fall during the\nupcoming six months.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nJPY and exports The exchange rate is an important factor for the Japanese equity market. Japan’s\n\ntrade balance could be in deficit and may impact USD-JPY rates. Key date: Nov\n21, Japanese trade balance\n\nBoJ’s monetary policy\n\nIf the Bank of Japan makes additional commitments to its asset-purchase\nboard meeting\n\nprogram, which is currently JPY 70 trillion in size, it would lead to a weaker yen,\nin our view. Key date: Oct 30, BoJ policy meeting\n\n2 UBS\n\nFor further information please contact ClO asset class specialist Toru Ibayashi, toru.ibayashi@ubs.com\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne Japanese value stocks have under-\nperformed growth stocks by more than\n20% for the last four months. We see this\nas an overreaction to concerns on the\nslower global economy, and recommend\npicking some value stocks with high\ndividend yields.\n\nWe prefer companies that are using cost-\nreduction initiatives to maintain price\ncompetitiveness during periods of yen\nstrength.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne A weaker USD-JPY rate may drive\nJapanese companies’ earnings recovery\nbeyond a technical recovery from natural\ndisasters. Japanese exporters and\ncompanies owning international\noperations would benefit from such a\ndevelopment.\n\nJapanese realized earnings likely to\nrecover further going forward\n\n(5)\n1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012\n\n— Top 12m realized earnings per share\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters, UBS, as of October 22, 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n18\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025265",
