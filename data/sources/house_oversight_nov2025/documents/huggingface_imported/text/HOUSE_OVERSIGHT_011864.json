Ever since the outbreak of the\nPalestinians’ first intifada, I believed this was as much in Israel’s own interest as\ntheirs. Yet when I entered office, we had no way of knowing whether Arafat\nwanted two states living side-by-side in peace. I felt it was my duty to find out,\nand, if the answer was yes, to put a peace agreement in place. I felt the same about\nway about Syria and Hafez al-Assad.\n\nWhen I left office, I believed I had achieved the most important goals of my\npremiership. We were out of Lebanon. Though we couldn’t achieve the peace\nagreements I had hoped for, it was not for lack of trying. Along the way, Israel had\ndemonstrated to the world that it was able and willing to consider painful\ncompromises, and that it was the Arab leaders who, at least for now, were unequal\nto the challenge of making peace. If I'd been able to retain the backing of the\nvoters who made me Prime Minister in 1999, we might even have moved ahead on\nunilateral disengagement from the Palestinians, dramatically altering the trajectory\nof our relationship. Yet even without that, Camp David did delineate the terms of\nany future peace arrangement. When and if conditions allowed a resumption of\nserious negotiating efforts, the shape, and indeed most of the details, of a final\npeace between our peoples were now clear.\n\nI was on holiday in the summer of 2001 when Clinton phoned me. 7he New\nTimes had run a piece on how and why the summit, and the subsequent\nnegotiations through the end of the year, ended in failure. When I later read the\narticle, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Deborah Sontag, I found it a\nmeandering mix of opinions garnered from an assortment of Americans,\nEuropeans, Israelis and Palestinians, including Arafat himself, with the overall\nconclusion that Clinton and I had not offered as generous a deal as was assumed\nand that it was somehow unfair to suggest the Palestinians deserved blame for\nrejecting it. There had been several other articles in various publications along the\nsame lines. I didn’t see much point at this stage in setting the record straight. To\nthe extent the content of the Times piece bothered me, it was a simple, but\nimportant, error of fact. Quoting Arafat himself, Sontag wrote that during the back-\npatio discussion I had with him at the dinner in Kochav Yair shortly before the new\nintifada, he’d “implored me to block Mr Sharon’s plans” to visit the Temple\nMount. Arafat didn’t raise the issue at all, and presumably knew that we had\nconsulted his West Bank security chief to ensure it happened quickly, avoided the\n\n393\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011864",
