  "text": "error, McCain could conceivably have been slightly ahead. This, then, was\nthe last presidential election. In the future, you’ Il only need to vote for\nthe pollster that you trust the most.\n\nDuring the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, | was among\n15,000 protesters who had gathered in Grant Park for a rally when the\npolice, triggered by the actions of one of their own provocateurs, attacked\nthe demonstrators and sadistically beat as many as they could reach. It\nseemed impossible that we could ever work within the system. But now,\nforty years later, there were 200,000 celebrants who had gathered in that\nsame park, giddy with the excitement of Obama’ s victory. They had\nworked within the system.\n\nDuring the past four decades, there has been a linear progression\nfrom Jimi Hendrix playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at Woodstock to\nAretha Franklin singing “My Country,‘ tis of Thee” at the inauguration.\nIs it possible that this event signified the early tremors of a nonviolent\nrevolution? As the late singer/songwriter Harry Chapin once said to me\nbackstage at a benefit: “If you don’ t act like there’ s hope, there /s no\nhope.” And remember, placebos work. My hope is | don’ t get\n\ndisappointed. [But | did.]\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015322",
