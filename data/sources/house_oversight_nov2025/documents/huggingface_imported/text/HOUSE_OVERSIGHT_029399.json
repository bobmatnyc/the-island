  "text": "New Firepower in Shocking Suit Against Trump | Law.com Page 2 of 3\n\nThe rape suit isn’t exactly new. It was filed pro se by “Katie Johnson” in Los Angeles federal court in\nApril, dismissed, refiled in the Southern District of New York, withdrawn and refiled on Sept. 30. But\nwith the addition of Mason—a media-savvy lawyer not known for shying away from the\nspotlight—the stakes have changed.\n\nSuddenly, it’s a lot more serious. Which is not the same as legitimate, but\nthe odds that the case will go away quietly are much slimmer given the\nrN firepower of her new counsel. Especially now, in the wake of a 2005\n\n= =| recording where Trump bragged about using his star power to kiss and\n; grope women.\n\nDAILY DICTA\n\nThe allegations in the suit are truly awful. Jane Doe says that when she was\n13, she attended parties at Epstein’s New York City townhouse, enticed by\npromises of money and a modeling career. She allegedly had sexual\nencounters with Trump on four occasions there.\n\nThe complaint states, “Defendant Trump tied plaintiff to a bed, exposed\nhimself to plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape plaintiff. During the\ncourse of this savage sexual attack, plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no\neffect. Defendant Trump responded to plaintiff's pleas by violently striking plaintiff in the face with\nhis open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.”\n\nEpstein allegedly raped her as well. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage girl for\nprostitution, and has faced other suits by women who allege underage sexual assault.\n\nTrump’s lawyer Alan Garten, has unequivocally denied the allegations. In fact, the current complaint\nquotes his denial: “The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level\nand clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is\nabsolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.” Doe’s suit claims that this statement is libelous.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for including such a seemingly absurd claim (how can you libel\nsomeone who is anonymous?) is that it’s not time-barred. The rest of the complaint probably is.\n\nThe alleged incidents took place in 1994—22 years ago. The complaint claims that Doe didn’t come\nforward because she was “unrelentingly threatened by each defendant that, were she ever to reveal\nany of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by defendants, plaintiff and her\nfamily would be physically harmed if not killed.”\n\nBut Epstein in 2008 was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Why couldn’t she have come forward\nthen?\n\nThat’s not the only problem with the case.\n\nI wrote about the suit when it was first filed in LA with great skepticism—“an anonymous stink\nbomb,” I called it.\n\nIn large part, I was dubious because the person filing the complaint, “Katie Johnson,” claimed her\nonly past work experience was as a freelance model. And yet her pro se complaint was perfectly\nformatted, with proper margins and numbering; it correctly cited statutes, got the venue and\njurisdiction correct and contained no typos.\n\nhttp://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/10/10/new-firepower-in-shocking-suit-against-tr... 10/11/2016\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029399",
