  "text": "And there’s more urbanization. Even by 2030 Lagos, San Paulo and Delhi will have\npopulations above 30 million. To prevent megacities becoming turbulent dystopias\nwill surely be a major challenge to governance.\n\nPopulation growth seems currently under-discussed. That is maybe because doom-\nladen forecasts in the 1970s, by the Club of Rome, Paul Erlich and others, have\nproved off the mark. Up till now, food production has more than kept pace — famines\nstem from wars or mal-distribution, not overall shortage. And it’s deemed by some a\ntaboo subject -- tainted by association with eugenics in the 1920s and 30s, with Indian\npolicies under Indira Gandhi, and more recently with China's hard-line one-child\n\npolicy.\n\nCan the Earth ‘carry’ 9 billion people? There seems no need for gloom or panic on\nthis front... Improved agriculture — low-till, water-conserving, and perhaps involving\nGM crops could feed that number by mid-century. The buzz-phrase is ‘sustainable\nintensification’.\n\nBut lifestyle changes are needed. The world couldn't sustain even its present\npopulation if everyone lived like Americans do today— using as much energy and\neating as much beef.\n\nPopulation trends beyond 2050 are harder to predict. They will depend on what\npeople as yet unborn decide about the number and spacing of their children.\nEnhanced education and empowerment of women -- surely a benign priority in\nitself -- reduces fertility rates.\n\nBut the demographic transition hasn’t reached parts of India and Sub-Saharan Africa.\nIf families in Africa remain large,, then according to the UN that continent’s\npopulation could double again by 2100, to 4 billion, thereby raising the global\npopulation to 11 billion. Nigeria alone would by then have as big a population as\nEurope and North America combined, and almost half of all the world’s children\nwould be in Africa.\n\nOptimists remind us that each extra mouth brings also two hands and a brain.\nNonetheless the higher the population becomes, the greater will be all pressures on\nresources, especially if the developing world narrows its gap with the developed\nworld in its per capita consumption. So we must surely hope that the global figure\ndeclines rather than rises after 2050.\n\nMoreover, if humanity’s collective impact on nature pushes too hard against what\nJohan Rockstrom calls ‘planetary boundaries’, the resultant ‘ecological shock’ could\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026733",
