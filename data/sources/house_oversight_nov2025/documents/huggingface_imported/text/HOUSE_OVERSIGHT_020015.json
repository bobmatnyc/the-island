  "text": "spotlight; he was well aware that the president meticulously logged all claims against\ncredit that he believed solely to be his. Both he and Kushner, the two most important\nfigures in the White House after the president, seemed professionally mute. Still, Bannon\nseemed to be everywhere, and the president was convinced—trightly—that it was the result\nof Bannon’s private press operation. More often than self-mockery could sustain, Bannon\nreferred to himself as “President Bannon.” A bitter Kellyanne Conway, regularly dissed\nfor her own spotlight grabbing, confirmed the president’s observation that Bannon stepped\ninto as many White House photo ops as possible. (Everybody seemed to keep count of\neverybody else’s photo bombs.) Bannon also did not much bother to disguise his\ninnumerable blind quotes, nor to make much of an effort to temper his not-so-private slurs\nagainst Kushner, Cohn, Powell, Conway, Priebus, and even the president’s daughter\n(often, most especially, the president’s daughter).\n\nCuriously, Bannon never expressed a sideways thought about Trump—not yet.\nTrump’s own righteousness and soundness was perhaps too central to Bannon’s construct\nof Trumpism. Trump was the idea you had to support. This could seem to approach the\ntraditional idea of respecting the office. In fact, it was the inverse. The man was the vessel:\nthere was no Bannon without Trump. However much he might stand on his unique, even\nmagical-seeming, contributions to the Trump victory, Bannon’s opportunity was wholly\nprovided by Trump’s peculiar talent. He was no more than the man behind the man—\nTrump’s Cromwell, as he put it, even though he was perfectly aware of Cromwell’s fate.\n\nBut his loyalty to the idea of Trump hardly protected him from the actual Trump’s\nconstant briefs against him. The president had assembled a wide jury to weigh Bannon’s\nfate, putting before it, in an insulting Borscht Belt style, a long list of Bannon’s\nannoyances: “Guy looks homeless. Take a shower, Steve. You’ve worn those pants for six\ndays. He says he’s made money, I don’t believe it.” (The president, notably, never much\ntook issue with Bannon’s policy views.) The Trump administration was hardly two months\nold, yet every media outlet was predicting Bannon’s coming defenestration.\n\nOne particularly profitable transaction with the president was to bring him new, ever\nharsher criticism of his chief strategist, or reports of other people criticizing him. It was\nimportant to know not to say anything positive to Trump about Bannon. Even faint praise\nbefore the “but’”—“Steve is obviously smart, but ...”—could produce a scowl and pout if\nyou didn’t hurry to the “but.” (Then again, saying anyone was “smart” invariably incurred\nTrump’s annoyance.) Kushner enlisted Scarborough and Brzezinski in something of a\nregular morning television Bannon slag-a-thon.\n\nH. R. McMaster, the three-star general who had replaced Michael Flynn as National\nSecurity Advisor, had secured the president’s pledge that he could veto members of the\nNSC. Kushner, a supporter of McMaster’s appointment, had quickly ensured that Dina\nPowell, a key player in the Kushner faction, would join the NSC and Bannon would be\nremoved.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020015",
