  "text": "As a start let’s at least fix the weird language of our current foreign policy world: We\ndon’t live in what they like to call a “Post Cold War” era anymore. (Who, after all,\ncalled the Enlightenment the “post-Feudal era”?) We live in what is probably best\ncalled “The Age of Network Power.” A world of connection is responding to a\npowerful logic of its own. It builds new platforms, sometimes defined by users or by\ntechnology or by the way in which currency or weapons move. Melvin Conway’s\ndeep engineering insight was right, the design of networks does affect our real\nworld. Even now itis shuffling us into “convergence” and “divergence” clubs. What\nis next is the struggle to decide who is in which club. What businesses will win?\nWhat technologies? Which ideas? Our only chance will be to learn a new instinct for\njust how power moves on networks. And it’s to this that we will turn now.\n\n57\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018289",
