It is the same with any quantum event: photons reflecting\nfrom a piece of glass, measuring the spin of an electron or measuring the\npolarization of a photon. All these quantum effects exist in superposition\nuntil measured. But in the real world, we don't experience superposition.\nIf I miss the train, I miss it. I don’t partially catch it and partially miss\nit, and I don’t experience any such quantum ambiguity. The only place\nI ever see such effects is watching science fiction movies. In real life the\nlarge scale world is certain. At what point does this quantum uncertainty\ntransition to our classical certainty? What is the state of the cat before I -\na sentient observer — open the box? Was the result of the decay measured\nby the Geiger counter, the cat, or are we waiting for someone to open the\nbox and observe the result?\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics — named\nafter the main center of early quantum theory at the Niels Bohr Institute\n— says the cat is both alive and dead until I make a measurement. ‘The cat\nis said to be in superposition, meaning a live cat and a dead cat inhabit\nthe same volume of space-time ‘experiencing’ both alternatives and\nwaiting for my measurement. This seems nonsensical, but Copenhagen\nquantum folk simply say, “That’s the way it is; the mathematics works, if\nyou don't like it, tough. Nature does not have to explain herself?\n\nEinstein strongly disagreed with this position. He believed the\nworld is certain and laws must govern radioactive decay and, therefore,\nthe breaking of the vial and the life and death of the cat. There must be\nsome, as yet, undiscovered theory. He reasoned as follows: A particle\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016017",
