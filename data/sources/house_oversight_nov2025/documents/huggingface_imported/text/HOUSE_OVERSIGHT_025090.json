  "text": "Danin believes that Rawabi's Palestinian\nand Qatari investors made a wise decision.\nHousing in Ramallah is expensive, and\nDanin says that there is a sizable and\nhighly-educated Palestinian middle class in\nneed of an alternative to the West Bank's\nde-facto capital. He expressed little doubt\nwhen I asked him if the West Bank\neconomy could support Rawabi. \"This is a\nPalestinian national project,\" he said. \"It is\nthe best of what is possible in that it's\nprivate sector-led, and it's profit-making\nled.\"\n\nAnd it has supporters in high places. When\nPresident Barack Obama met with Israeli\nofficials in Washington in September of\n2010, Rawabi was on the agenda.\n\nFrom one perspective, Rawabi is a historic\ninvestment in Palestine, as well as an\nunusually open point of cooperation\nbetween Israel and an Arab government. It\ncould improve the lives of Palestinians,\nwhile convincing Israelis that they have\nnothing to fear from their neighbors'\nprosperity. But any attempts to change\n\nthe status quo in the West Bank are fraught\nwith difficulties.\n\nThere's Israeli bureaucracy to overcome.\n\"In Israel, if the Minister of Defense says I\nwant something, it's not that the system\nthwarts it. But the system is so\ndecentralized that ultimately it takes a lot\nof steps to get it translated into action,\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025090",
