  "text": "analyses of historical data together with experiments. Religious groups show higher levels of\ncooperation, often over longer periods of time, than many other organized, but non-religious groups.\nReligious groups also tend to last longer as groups than non-religious organizations or institutions.\nCooperation among religious groups 1s often facilitated by punishment or the implication of punishment\nfrom a deity. In a study of 186 societies by the biologist Dominic Johnson, analyses showed that those\nwho believed in a strong moralizing god, capable of doling out punishment, engaged in higher levels of\ncooperation, including paying taxes, complying with norms, and repaying loans. These observations are\ncomplimented by experiments showing that people are more generous about giving away their money ina\nbargaining game, and less likely to cheat, when they think about words associated with religion — divine,\nGod, spirit, sacred, prophet — than when they think about neutral words. For example, in the dictator\ngame, involving two anonymous players, one decides how much of a pot of money to give to the other.\nThe recipient has no say, and is thus stuck with whatever the donor offers. In general, donors give either\nnothing or about half. When primed to think about religion, donors are more likely to give than keep the\nentire pot, and give more as well.\n\nThe implication of these results is that the religiously-minded feel that they are being watched.\nCueing up words that are indicative of their religious beliefs, heightens their vigilance and their moral\nobligations. Religion fuels altruism and fends off the temptation to cheat.\n\nAll of the observations and experiments discussed above are fascinating and relevant to\nunderstanding the role of religion in past and present societies. But this evidence is irrelevant for\nunderstanding the evolutionary origins of religion. It is irrelevant because it can’t determine whether\nreligion originally evolved to solve the problem of large scale cooperation among strangers or whether it\nevolved for other reasons but was then used in the context of cooperation. This alternative explanation\nsees religion as an exaptation. No one doubts that religion provides social cohesion. No one doubts that\nreligion also sends a buzzing reminder to the brain’s moral conscience center. But from a description of\nwhat it does today, or even in the distant past, we can’t conclude that it evolved for this purpose. That\nreligious organizations show higher levels of cooperation than non-religious groups doesn’t mean they\nevolved for cooperation. We also can’t conclude that religion’s effectiveness as social glue relies on\nuniquely religious psychological thoughts and emotions. Though the creation of and belief in\nsupernatural powers may be unique to religion, other foundational beliefs and emotions are shared across\ndifferent domains of knowledge: young children attribute intentions, beliefs and desires to unseen causes,\nincluding the movement of clouds and leaves; non-religious moral systems use punishment to embarrass,\nrecruit regret, and fuel shame; like many religions, non-religious institutions also attempt to reprogram the\nthoughts and beliefs of its members — think of all the global rebel operatives that brainwash innocent\n\nchildren into becoming child soldiers. Religion helps itself to non-religious psychology. The utility of\n\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 25\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012771",
