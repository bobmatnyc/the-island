  "text": "most dogged and hyperbolic antagonists—“one of America’s most\nnotorious sex offenders.”\n\nAnd yet the mighty and powerful, apparently evaluating the nature of\ndisgrace on their own terms, beat a path to his door. It’s a fantastic conclave\nof influence in his dining room: financiers, billionaires, heads of state,\neconomic ministers.\n\nHe surely represents the kind of insiderism that is mostly just a\nfigment in outsiders’ fantasies. Except for the fact that, straining credulity,\nEpstein is real. His is an ultimate sort of fantasy of power, wealth, and\nsecrecy. (In 2004, when the then owners of this magazine put it up for sale, I\nwas involved with a group trying to buy it—an effort in which Epstein\nvolunteered to invest $20 million. New York was subsequently sold to\nanother wealthy investor.) Were the International Jewish conspiracy to\nactually exist, it might be here in his dining room (while not everybody in\nhis circle is Jewish, an obvious “think Yiddish” point of view prevails).\n\nWithout ever being asked to keep what I have heard here off the\nrecord, I’ve willingly done so, least I not be invited back. And, too, to\nprotect him. Who would understand Jeffrey? Who could explain him?\n\nCertainly Epstein’s past encounters with the press (and in many ways\nwith the entire outside world) have been about as disastrous as any could be,\nhelping to open a Pandora’s box of lifestyle vulnerabilities that sent him to\nprison on a prostitution charge in 2008.\n\nAnd yet here he 1s, in his 50,000 square foot mansion, dispensing\nadvice to world leaders and business titans.\n\nIndeed, Epstein has been advising Bill Gates on a new way to increase\nthe already vast clout of the Gates Foundation by adding funds from other\nwealthy individuals that can use the Gates resources (the Gates Foundation\nnow employs 1,200 people), but which can be directed to separate causes\nand goals. And it is Gates who at the end of the summer began prodding\nEpstein to begin a process of public rehabilitation.\n\nHence, as part of an effort to get “out in front” of the unfavorable\nnotice that might greet Gates’ public association with him, Epstein agreed to\nseveral on the record conversation with me, in the hope, on his part, that,\nafter five years since his release from prison, he might be able to leaven his\nreputation. And with the hope on my part of learning more about how and if\nthe rich are different than you and me (although we can fairly dispense with\nthe if).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022709",
