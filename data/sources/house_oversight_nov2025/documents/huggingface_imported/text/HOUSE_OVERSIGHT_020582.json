Indeed, more recent scholarship has\nshattered the shibboleth that the Chinese government only recruits ethnic Chinese. While\nChinese intelligence does have a historically strong track record of attempting to recruit\nethnic Chinese, primarily because of cultural and language affinity, more recent cases of\nespionage and technology transfer suggest that the Chinese government has broadened its\ntradecraft to recruit nonethnic Chinese assets and collectors as well, perhaps as a way of\ncomplicating US counterintelligence efforts.\n\nChina’s most systematic channel for identifying foreign-based nontraditional collectors is\nits Recruitment Program of Global Experts (2S BRATS|HItz), commonly known as\n\nthe Thousand Talents Plan (FAit&I) or the Thousand Talents Program (TTP).° The TTP is a\nmassive and sustained talent recruitment campaign designed to recruit leading experts from\noverseas to assist in the country’s modernization drive.\n\nInitiated in 2008, the TTP aims to recruit leading overseas scientists and experts who work\nin areas that are deemed high priority for achieving China’s modernization goals.° The\nprogram originally aimed to recruit 1,000 “overseas talents” (#3\\A4) over a period of five\nto ten years. Official Chinese TTP websites list more than three hundred US government\nresearchers and more than six hundred US corporate personnel who have accepted TTP\nmoney.’ In many cases, these individuals do not disclose receiving the TTP money to their\nemployer, which for US government employees is illegal and for corporate personnel likely\nrepresents a conflict of interest that violates their employee agreement.\n\nState Collection Apparatus\n\nChina’s nontraditional collection relies on a web of activities, including open-source research,\nexchanges, cooperation and professional organizations, direct funding of research, strategic\nacquisition, or cyberespionage.\n\nOpen-source\n\nChina’s efforts to exploit foreign innovation is further seen in its open-source acquisition\ninfrastructure, which surpasses that of any other country. China employs a cadre of\nthousands to locate, study, and disseminate foreign journals, patents, proceedings,\ndissertations, and technical standards without regard to ownership or copyright restrictions.\nThe documents are indexed, archived, and supplied to Chinese commercial and military\n“customers.”\n\nSection 8\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020582",
