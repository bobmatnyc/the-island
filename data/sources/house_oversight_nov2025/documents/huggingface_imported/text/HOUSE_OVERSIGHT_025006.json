  "text": "Article 3.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nPalestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat on\n\nstatehood moves at U.N.\nEdmund Sanders\n\nSeptember 6, 2011 -- Palestinians have everyone guessing about their\nnext move. Defying the United States and Israel, the Palestinian\nAuthority is expected this month to apply for full membership in the\nUnited Nations. If the Obama administration vetoes the application in\nthe Security Council as expected, Palestinian officials are likely to\nturn to the General Assembly to upgrade their status from non-\nmember \"entity\" to non-member \"state.\" Gaining de facto statehood\nrecognition from the international body could allow Palestinians to\njoin key U.N. institutions, such as the International Criminal Court.\nPalestinian leaders say they have enough votes for such a move. But\nwith two weeks before the General Assembly convenes, they have\nremained vague about their exact plans, and have refused to say\nexactly what a U.N. membership application or General Assembly\nresolution might say. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, a member\nof the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee,\ndiscussed with The Times what Palestinians are planning and why he\nthinks the U.N. bid, if unsuccessful, could spell the end of the\nPalestinian Authority.\n\nThere's been a flurry of last-minute pressure from the U.S. and\nMideast ''quartet\" to convince Palestinians to shelve the U.N.\nmembership bid. [White House envoys David Hale and Dennis\nRoss arrived in the region Tuesday.] Any chance of that\nhappening?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025006",
