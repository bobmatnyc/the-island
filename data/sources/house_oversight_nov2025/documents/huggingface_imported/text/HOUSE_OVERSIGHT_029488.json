The customer that rides on the stretcher deservers friendly and efficient\nservice. The second customer is the facility requesting patient transport. The third customers are\nthe staff that transports the clients in a timely, professional and courteous atmosphere. These\ncustomers deserve prompt quality service as well as friendly and efficient service.\n\nIt has been found through research, that the company that makes public relations Priority One has\nbeen very successful. With the healthcare profession being a tight circle of professionals, the word\nwill quickly spread of the fast, friendly, and efficient service that is being provided. Once this\nreputation is established, and maintained, the advertising will be a part of each associates daily\nactivities and duties.\n\nTwin City Mobile Integrated Health Services will also align itself with organizations, whose\nclients will utilize our service.

It allows paramedics and emergency medical\ntechnicians (EMTs) to operate in expanded roles to provide healthcare services to underserved\npopulations. It is a way to improve rural emergency medical services (EMS) as well as address the\nhealthcare needs of the community.\n\nSome rural patients lack access to primary care, and misuse 911 services in an attempt to access\nemergency departments for routine healthcare. This is demanding on EMS personnel in rural areas\nand causes strains on the workforce. Working in a primary care role, our community paramedics\ncan meet the needs of such individuals, as well as others in the community, in a more efficient and\nproactive way.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029488",
