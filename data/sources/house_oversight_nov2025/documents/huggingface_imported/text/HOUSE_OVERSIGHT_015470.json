Load your starship with 300,000 nucle-\nar bombs, detonate\none every three sec-\nonds, and ride the blast\nwaves. Though extreme,\nit works on the same\nbasic principle as any\nother rocket—namely,\nrecoil. Instead of shoot-\ning atoms out the back\nof the rocket, the nucle-\nar-pulse system shoots\nblobs of plasma, such as\nfireballs of tungsten.\n\nYou pack a plug of\ntungsten along with a\nnuclear weapon into a\nmetal capsule, fire the\ncapsule out the back of\nthe ship, and set it off\na short distance away.\nIn the vacuum of space,\nthe explosion does less\ndamage than you might\nexpect. Vaporized tung-\nsten hurtles toward the ship, rebounds off a thick\nmetal plate at the ship’s rear, and shoots into space,\nwhile the ship recoils, thereby moving forward. Giant\nshock absorbers lessen the jolt on the crew quarters.\nPassengers playing 3-D chess, or doing whatever else\ninterstellar passengers do, would feel rhythmic thuds\nlike kids yumping rope in the apartment upstairs.\n\nThe ship might reach a tenth the speed of light.\nIf for some reason—solar explosion, alien invasion\nwe really had to get off the planet fast and we didn’t\n\ncare about nuking the launch pad, this would be the\nway to go. We already have everything we need for\n\nit. “Today the closest technology we have would be\nnuclear pulse,” Matloff says. If anything, most people\nwould be happy to load up all our nukes on a ship and\nbe rid of them.\n\nIdeally, the bomb blasts would be replaced with con-\ntrolled nuclear fusion reactions. That was the approach\nsuggested by Project Daedalus, a ’70s-era effort to\ndesign a fully equipped robotic interstellar vessel. The\nbiggest problem was that for every ton of payload,\nthe ship would have to carry 100 tons of fuel. Such a\nbehemoth would be the\nsize of a battleship, with a\nlength of 200 meters and\na mass of 50,000 tons.\n\n“Tt was just a huge,\nmonstrous machine,”\nsays Kelvin Long, an Eng-\nlish aerospace engineer\nand co-founder of Project\nIcarus, a modem effort\nto update the design.\n“But what’s happened\nsince then, of course, 1s\nmicroelectronics, minia-\nturization of technology,\nnanotechnology. All these\ndevelopments have led\nto a rethinking. Do you\nreally need these mas-\nsive structures?” He says\nProject Icarus planned to\nunveil the new design in\nLondon in October 2013.\n\nInterstellar design-\ners have come up with all sorts of ways to shrink the\nfuel tank. For instance, the ship could use electric or\nmagnetic fields to scoop up hydrogen gas from inter-\nstellar space. The hydrogen would then be fed into a\nfusion reactor. The faster the ship were to go, the faster\nit would scoop—a virtuous cycle that, if maintained,\nwould propel the ship to nearly the speed of light.\nUnfortunately, the scooping system would also pro-\nduce drag forces, slowing the ship, and the headwind\nof particles would cook the crew with radiation. Also,\npure-hydrogen fusion 1s inefficient. A fusion-powered\nship probably couldn’t avoid hauling some fuel from\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015470",
