  "text": "the night that Milk was murdered, they had been among the 30,000 who\nmarched silently to City Hall for a candlelight vigil. Now they were in the\nmiddle of a post-verdict riot, utterly furious.\n\nBut where were the cops? They were all fuming /ns/de City Hall--\nwhere their commander had instructed them to stay—-armed prisoners\nwatching helplessly as angry demonstrators broke the glass trying to ram\ntheir way through the locked doors.\n\n| spotted Weiss and a student from his magazine-writng class,\nMarilee Strong. The three of us circulated through the crowd. Standing in\nthe middle of the intersection, Chronicle columnist Warren Hinckle was\ntalking with a police official, and he beckoned me to join them. | gathered\nfrom their conversation that the cops were about to be released from City\nHall. Some were already out. One kept banging his baton on the phone\nbooth where Weiss was calling in his story, and he had to wave his press\ncard before the cop would leave.\n\n| found Marilee and suggested that we get away from the area. As\nwe walked north on Polk Street, the police were beginning to march slowly\nin formation not too far behind us. But the instant they were out of view\nfrom City Hall, they broke ranks and started running toward us, hitting the\n\nmetal pole of a bus stop with their billy clubs, making loud, scary clangs.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015445",
