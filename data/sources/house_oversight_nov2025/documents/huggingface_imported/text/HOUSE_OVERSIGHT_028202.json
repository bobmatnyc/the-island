At least this time, Arafat didn’t take notes as we spoke.\nThe mood was friendly. We talked about a whole range of issues. With ony one\nexception: what was really happening, or what should happen, in the summit talks.\nI found the exercise disappointing as a result. But Yossi Ginossar assured me it\nwould help the atmosphere, and would eventually translate into negotiating\nprogress. “I hope so,” I said.\n\nIt wasn’t until day-four that real talks began. The Americans arranged for\nnegotiating teams from both sides on borders, the refugee issue, and Jerusalem to\nmeet with President Clinton. The Palestinians participated, but showed no sign at\nall of a readiness to compromise. Borders should have been the most\nstraightforward. Assuming we wanted a deal, it was about sitting down with a map\nand working out how to address both sides’ arguments. But Arafat’s representative\nin the meeting — the Oslo negotiator Abu Ala’a — said he wouldn’t even discuss\nborders without a prior agreement to land swaps ensuring Palestinian control over\nan area equivalent to 100 percent of the West Bank. Shlomo Ben-Ami did try to\nfind a way around this. He suggested the Palestinians assume that to be the case for\nthe purposes of the meeting, so that at least there could be meaningful discussion\nof the border, including the provisions Israel wanted in order to retain the major\nsettlement blocks. President Clinton agreed that made sense. He said that without\ntalking about the substance of such issues, there wasn’t going to be a deal. Even\nAbu Ala’a seemed receptive, according to Shlomo. But he insisted that he would\nhave to ask Arafat first whether it was okay.\n\nOn refugees, pretty much the same thing happened. The Americans, and I\nassumed at that point even the Palestinians, knew that a peace deal would be\nimpossible if we agreed to hundreds of thousands of refugees entering Israel — in\neffect leaving the state created in 1948 with a Jewish minority. But when President\nClinton began trying to narrow down details of a compromise resettlement package\n— how many refugees would return, where they would go, and how to arrange\ninternational financial support for them — Abu Mazen insisted that nothing could\nbe discussed until without a prior Israeli acceptance of the “principle of the right of\nreturn.” On Jerusalem, according to Gilead Sher, the President didn’t even try to\nfind common ground on the core issue: sovereignty. Instead he used the formula\nShlomo Ben-Ami had suggested, telling each side to proceed on the assumption\nsovereignty was decided in its favour, and to concentrate instead on how everyday\n\n354\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028202",
