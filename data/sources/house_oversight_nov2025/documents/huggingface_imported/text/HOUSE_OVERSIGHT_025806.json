  "text": "TJP summary. Syria Iran is a game changer for Israel which requires them to\ncompletely rethink their threats, opportunities, strategies and interests. They can\nhunker down until more clarity or they act (big or small). There is a feeling that\nIsrael has some acts they can take that would improve their positioning. Iran is\nthe most immediate and big issue. Cannot have an Iran with nukes. Will lead to\nproliferation and significantly increased probability of nuclear event. Israel\ncannot sit by.\n\nDennis Ross, Jane Harmon and Walter Isaacson.\n\nDR: Syria is most secure border that Israel has. Syria is unraveling is very\nsignificant. WMD could go to terrorists. Everyone should share concerns about\nSyria’s WMD. _ Hezbollah loses supplier, but unraveling of Syria has huge\nconsequences for Jordan. Bibi is sensitive to Jordan issues. We need to have a\nvery serious conversation with Bibi. (does Obama have the credibility reserve to\nhave that conversation).\n\nJane H: Israelis misplayed this. They encouraged us not to play in Syria. They\nfailed to anticipate Arab Spring and its consequences. Iran needs to be our\nfocus. US narrative on ME is lost. So is Israel’s.\n\nWalter: What effect on Israel : Palestine issues. Israel: Turkey issues. Will\nIsrael think big? Can Israel coalesce parties around a solution to Iran issue. Can\nthey do this by agreeing to a Palestinian solution.\n\nDR: Now would be a moment for Israel to take a brave initiative with Turkey.\nHaving an Islamic country as an ally may give cover to other Islamic countries.\nIsrael and Turkey have common interests in Syria. This outcome is possible,\nBibi needs assurances on Turkey’s response to an Israeli apology.\n\nJane. Maybe rise of Islamists in Egypt has some good aspects. If Muslim Bro\nkeeps treaty (w Israel) then you have an Islamic country owning a treaty with\nIsrael.\n\nDR. Muslim Bro is very busy with domestic issues. But let’s remember who\nthey are. Morsi sent letter to Shimon Perez. Perez said thank you and asked\nMorsi if Israeli’s could take letter public. Morsi said yes, it was written with that\nin mind. Perez made it public, Egyptian Muslim Bro got angry so Morsi denied\nhe had ever sent a letter. Tunisia’s Muslim Bro are drafting a constitution that\n\nmakes it criminal to support a peace with Israel.\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025806",
