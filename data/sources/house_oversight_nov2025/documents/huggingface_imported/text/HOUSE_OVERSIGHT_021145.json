  "text": "The Billionaire’s Playboy Club\nBy Virginia Roberts\n\nTo my true love Robbie who believes in me every step of the way and\nto all of my children, you are all my very inspirations!\n\nChapter!\n\nEvery single person in this shared world together has a unique story of\nhis or her own to tell, this one is mine.\n\nIt was coming up to my third night camping out at Miami Beach in the\nsummer of 1997. [ was thirteen years old and hiding from a world full of\nhurt. Sitting on the shoreline for hours watching the sunset fall deeper\ninto the horizon, my eyes were glazed over with tears, not from being\nwind-whipped by the rough sea breeze, but from reflecting on the abuse I\nencountered as a young girl and how everyone in my life who was\nsupposed to be there for me had now turned their backs on me in\nabandonment. My fears crept up and the excitement of escaping all of\nthem faded now realizing how alone I really was now, and for the hunger\nthat was paining my belly. At this point, with nowhere to go and only\ntime to waste, I wiped the tears from my eyes and set out to find an\nempathetic person that I could manage to get dinner money from. If not,\nit wouldn’t have been the first time I had gone hungry for the night. |\nwalked to the nearest bus stop and asked a handful of people for any\nspare change, none of whom that could help me. Sitting down on a\nnearby curb disappointed in grief of my current state, I put my head into\nmy knees and began to sob.\n\nOut of nowhere, it seemed, a black stretch limousine turned the comer\nand stopped in front of the curb where I had been hopelessly lost. The\nback door opened to reveal a heavy weight and balding, old man with a\nbig cheesy smile. Neatly dressed in black trousers and a collared shirt, he\nwas sitting next to a striking young, blonde girl, drop dead beautiful and\ndressed in a foxy red mini dress she looked like a model just stepping off\na runway.\n\nTheir smiles greeted me warmly and he kindly asked, “What is such a\nsweet little girl like you doing sitting alone on the street looking so\nupset?” Shocked from this strangers concern | was hesitant in telling him\nthe truth. Reluctantly | decided to tell him that I was a runaway, not from\naround here and really hungry. Hoping at most, I would get some money\nfor food from him. He instantly displayed a chilling excitement and\noffered me to come into his car so we could talk some more. That\n\n| Copyright Protected Material\nCONLIDENTIAL GIUFFREO04 134\n\nEXHIBIT 4\n0 Copyright Protected Material\n\nshould’ve been my first queue to get out of there quick but with no where\nto go, and so naive [ didn’t realize how much worse it could get. Setting\nfoot into that limo, I made my first entrance into a world that would\nentrap me for many years to come.\n\nHe introduced himself immediately as Ron Eppinger, a businessman\nand owner of a successful modeling agency, called “Perfect 10”.\nFlaunting his oozing wealth by introducing one of his many girlfriends,\nthe beauty next to him was Yana, a supposed model from the Czech\nRepublic who looked like she could be in her early twenties with the\nheavy load of makeup she was wearing, but really was only in her late\nteens. She kissed me on both cheeks and politely satd “Hello” in a thick\nCzech accent, making me feel a little more at ease. Convinced it couldn’t\nbe that bad there was another girl in the car, right? | couldn't be more\nwrong.\n\nWhat he didn’t tell me to begin with was that his modeling agency was\nonly posing for an undercover trade. By the time I found out f thought it\nwas too late to run. His business was really an illegal immigrant\ntrafficking ring of young women mostly consisting of underage girls that\nhe was using as escorts to make him uber rich. Only available to a\nselective clientele costing them anywhere from $1000.00 and over per\nhour of erotic entertainment, the girls were trained to fulfill every sexual\ndesire asked of them, no matter how bizarre the requests might be. The\nhigh paid escorts, for Ron’s super rich clientele, such as Yana and many\nother charismatic beauties would only benefit a fraction of their earnings\nfor themselves, Ron reaping in the majority of the financial rewards and\nbeing they were all illegal immigrants they were further trapped by his\nenslavement.\n\nI proceeded to introduce myself, besides what he had found out about\nme on the curbside. Telling him my name and a little about how I ended\nup on the streets explaining that I could take care of myself and didn’t\nneed my family or anyone to look after me anymore. Looking back later\nin life I can now admit I was ina terrible state, but being such a\nheadstrong teenager, I refused to give in. He asked my age and J told him\nI was sixteen at first. He coyly replied, “Are you sure? I think you could\nbe telling me a fib? How old are you... really? I wont be mad” Being a\nterrible liar, 1 knew had been caught out and couldn’t deny it any further.\nI told him the truth and he chuckled then paused and answered in a very\nserious tone “ As long as you never lie to me again I will take you in”\nRight away | pondered to myself what did he mean...take me in?\n\nHe gave the driver the location of our destination and rolled the middle\nwindow back up to then tell me a story of how his daughter had passed\naway seven years ago from a horrific car accident in which four other\nteens were killed and he has never gotten over it. | reacted with sheer\n\nGIULFRLO04 135\n\n2\nAGREN BLANDO REPORTING\nBlaie Iam\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021145",
