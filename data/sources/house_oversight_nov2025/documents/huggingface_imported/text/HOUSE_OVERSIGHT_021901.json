I think he referred to it as the holy grail.\nThis was Jeffrey Epstein's, you know, telephone book\nwhere he had telephone numbers in it. And so Rodriguez\nhad that and, you know, I guess thought that this was\nwould be worth a lot of money because it would -- it\nwould identify all of the people that have been sexually\nabused by Jeffrey Epstein.
