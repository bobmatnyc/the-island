  "text": "Earth, only 2 million of which have been\nidentified thus far. Most of the species\nidentified are either born with the\ncapacity to find sustenance and avoid\npredation sufficiently well that some\nsurvive long enough to reproduce, or\nthey are born in such large numbers that\nsome survive long enough to reproduce.\nIt is the ability of such organisms to\nreproduce that determines what genes\nconstitute the gene pool for the future\ngenerations of that species. These genes\nin turn, shape the structure and function\nof the organisms that constitute a\nspecies. This reasoning led George\nWilliams (2) to suggest a half century\nago that traits (i1.e., behavioral\ntendencies) which benefit the group at\nthe expense of the individual would\nevolve only if the process of group-\nselection was great enough to overcome\nselection within groups. He further\nsuggested that group selection is nearly\nalways weak, so that group-related\nadaptations do not exist (3). Richard\nDawkins (/) popularized the notion that\ntraits which evolve are adaptive at the\ngene level through his use of the\nmetaphor of the selfish gene. Genes\nserve their own selfish interests in the\nsense that whatever the contributions\nmade by a gene, or set of genes, to an\norganism’s structure and function would\nbe passed on to the next generation if\nand only if the gene made its way to the\ngene pool. Survival of the fittest now\nhad a biological basis.\n\nUnited We Stand, Divided We Fall\n\n2\n\nCharles Darwin did not know\nthat genes were the mechanism through\nwhich structures and behaviors evolved,\nbut an important component of his\noriginal theory was the notion of\nsurvival of the fittest. Darwin was also\npuzzled by the observation that many\nindividual organisms made themselves\n\nPage |20\n\nless fit so that the group might survive.\nSubsequent generations of evolutionary\nbiologists realized that even though\ngenes might act as if selfish, the vehicle\nresponsible for the transport of these\ngenes to the gene pool occasionally\nextended beyond the individual or parent\nto kin and even to unrelated members of\ngroups. More specifically, in some cases\nthe superorganismal structures formed\nby social organisms represent naturally\nselected levels of organization above\nindividual organisms (4).\n\nConsider the example of the\nEmperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri).\nEmperor penguins typically reside near\ntheir food source of squid, shoaling fish,\nand small crustaceans but in early winter\nthey gather into breeding colonies\n(rookeries) up to 60 miles inland in April\nand May during the Antarctic winter.\nThey search for their mate from the\nprevious year, and go through a\ncourtship ritual before mating. The\nfemale lays only one egg in May or\nJune, which coincides with the start of\nthe bitter Antarctica winter. The\nEmperor penguins are thought to have\ndeveloped this unusual winter breeding\nbehavior to permit the chick to grow to\nindependence the following summer,\nwhen food is plentiful. Ensuring the\nchick survives that long is a collective\nenterprise, with the vehicle responsible\nfor the chick surviving long enough such\nthat it too can reproduce not being solely\nthe mother or the father but also the\nhuddle.\n\nThe birthing of the egg leaves the\nmother depleted, so she must return to\nthe seaside to feed while the father\nassumes responsibility for the incubation\nof the egg during the winter. An egg\nfrom an Emperor penguin will quickly\nfreeze if left exposed to harsh winter\nconditions of the Antarctica, so the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021266",
