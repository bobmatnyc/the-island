  "text": "And, Mr. President, that was the forerunner of the same “Don’ t\nask, don’ t tell” policy that you promised to rescind, only you haven’ t\nbeen acting like a Commander-in-Chief. All you have to do is sign such a\ndirective. Those who serve in the military are trained to follow orders. If\nthey can follow orders to kill fellow humans, they can certainly follow\norders to treat openly gay service people with total equality.\n\nNot only is the current guideline counterproductive, but also this\ndisplay of trickle-down immorality must, on some level of consciousness,\nserve as a contributing factor to enabling the anti-gay bullying and\ntorturing of innocent victims. | know, you don’ t want to take a chance\nthat retracting the policy would interfere with your re-election. You’ ve\nmade the point that you don’ t want Mitt Romney to win in 2012 and turn\naround all the good things you’ ve accomplished.\n\nIncidentally, Romney had wanted to overturn Roe vs. Wade, yet, in\n1994, when he was running for the Senate, he came out in favor of choice\nfor women. However, freelance journalist Suzan Mazur revealed that he\nadmitted to Mormon feminist Judith Dushku that “the Brethren” in Salt\nLake City to/d him he could take a pro-choice position, and that in fact he\nprobably had to in order to win in a liberal state like Massachusetts.\n\nPandering trumps religious belief.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015327",
