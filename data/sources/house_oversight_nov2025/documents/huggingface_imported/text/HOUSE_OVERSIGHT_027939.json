  "text": "were still Egyptian soldiers around us, though I doubt any of us expected\ntrouble. Still, there were well-established rules for setting up a defensible\nposition when an armored force halts for the night. As Eitan briefed his officers,\nI stood a few feet off to the side and listened. Suddenly, the commander of his\nAMX company interrupted. “Sir,” he said, ‘““why are we staying here — right on\nthe main road? There are Egyptians still out there. Behind us, for sure. And any\nforce ahead of us will run straight into us. Why not a few hundred yards off to\nthe side, in a place that gives us a view of any enemy movement, or allows us to\nambush an approaching force?” I could see that he was right. I expected Eitan to\nagree and alter the arrangements. But he didn’t. I think that, having ordered his\nmen to encamp on the road 20 minutes earlier, he was reluctant to get his tanks\nand halftracks moving again. No doubt, some of the exhausted crews were\nalready asleep.\n\nI parked our Jeep a few yards off the road. We organized a series of watches:\nAvraham, then Rafi and Danny, with me taking the pre-dawn stretch. A few\nhours later, Rafi nudged me awake. “I heard something,” he said, pointing west\ntoward the Suez Canal. “It was faint. But I think so.” I told him to keep\nlistening. For a while, everything seemed fine. Then, Danny woke me up. He\nsaid he was sure he heard a faint tremor, as if from tanks or APCs. I put my ear\nto the ground. I heard it too. I told him to go to Eitan’s command halftrack,\ninsist he be woken up, and tell him. When he got back, Danny said: “I told\nhim.”\n\n“And?”\n\n“Don’t know,” he replied. “He said I could go.” I tried to grab a bit more\nsleep before my watch. But barely 15 minutes later, Danny jostled me awake\nagain. “I’m sure now,” he said. “Whatever it is, it’s closer.” I went off to find\nEitan. But before I got there, a column of Egyptian T-55 tanks suddenly\nappeared on the road, 50 yards from the front of our column. I’m sure they were\nevery bit as surprised as we were to be face-to-face with enemy armor. But they\nknew what to do. They opened fire.\n\nHad we been deployed a few hundred yards off the road, we’d have seen\nthem coming. If the battalion commander had acted on Danny’s warning, we’d\nhave had an extra 20 minutes to prepare. But the shells jolted our crews awake.\nWithin 30 seconds, they were returning fire. But our tanks barely dented the\nheavily armored T- 55s. Nearly every one of theirs seemed to score a direct hit.\nWithin minutes, a number of our halftracks, and one of our tanks, were in\nflames.\n\n91\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027939",
