What to do what to do? Fortunately a rather nice invite has arrived to the mysteriously named\nHouse of the Nobleman. It's Before Midday and North of The River but said nobleman is allegedly a Russian\nbillionaire so it's hard to say no. Plus champers and canapés are champers and canapés. And it’s a gallery ina\nhouse so really we have to check out the competition.\n\nhttp://www.oakmayneproperties.com\n\n“Highlight of Freeze!” shouts the press release. We'll see. First impressions are good. The house is on the Outer\nCircle of The Regent’s Park and just like the theatre that’s the place to be hot. Important looking girl asks us have\nwe been invited. “Qu’est-ce que c’est?”\n\nIndoors, the ceilings are surprisingly low for us six footers. The interior designer clearly has a penchant for egg-&-\ndart cornicing. It’s everywhere, except where it’s broken by over-scaled doors. Marble bathrooms, lit stair treads,\nshiny black kitchen. It’s all a bit bling for Lavender’s Blue taste and we don’t really do Post 1900 anyway.\n\nBut my gosh the art on display reads like a Who’s Who list. Here’s a tour:\n\n\"Is it Art or is it a Chair?\" asks Zelda in a loud stage whisper\n\nBut where's the Bubbly?\nWhen Alvar met Andy on the landing\n\n31\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028311",
