  "text": "28\n\nPalestinians; and 20,000 Islamists killed in 1982 by the elder al-\nAssad in Hama. The World Health Organization’s estimate of Osama\nbin Laden’s carnage in Iraq was already 150,000 a few years earlier.\nIn a 2007 research, Gunnar Heinsohn from the University of Bremen\nand Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, found out that\nsome 11 million Muslims have been violently killed since 1948, of\nwhich 35,000, (0.3 percent) died during the six years of Arab war\nagainst Israel, or one out of every 315 fatalities. In contrast, over 90\npercent who perished were killed by fellow Muslims. According to\nMssrs. Heinsohn and Pipes, the grisly inventory finds the total\nnumber of deaths in conflicts all over the world since 1950\nnumbering around 85 million. Of that, the Muslim Arab deaths in the\nArab-Israeli conflict were at 46,000 including 11,000 during Israel’s\nwar of independence. That makes 0.05 percent of all deaths in all\nconflicts, or 0.4 percent of all Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nIn another calculation ignoring “small” massacres like the one that\ngoes on in Syria and other deaths during the Arab Spring, only\nSaddam’s Iraq, Jordan, the elder al-Assad’s Syria, Iran-Iraq war, the\nbin Laden campaign in Iraq, the Iranian Islamic revolution and the\nTurkish-Kurdish conflict caused 1.65 million Muslim deaths by\nMuslims compared to less than 50,000 deaths in the Arab-Israeli\nconflict since 1950, including fatalities during and after Operation\nCast Lead which came after the Heinsohn-Pipes study. For those who\ndon’t have a calculator ready at their desks, allow me to tell: 50,000\nis three percent of 1.65 million. Golda Meir, the fourth prime\nminister of Israel, or rather the “Mother of Israel,” had a perfectly\nrealistic point when she said that peace in the Middle East would\nonly be possible “when Arabs love their children more than they hate\n\n29\n\nus.\n\nBurak Bekdil is an Ankara-based freelance journalist.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031940",
