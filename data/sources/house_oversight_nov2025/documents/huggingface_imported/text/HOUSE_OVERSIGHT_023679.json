Robert, great to see you again. You were\nwith us at the very beginning of the Party Congress and\nyou were at the Congress today when it finished. Did you\nhave any vision, any inkling that President Xi Jinping\nwould take on so much authority? Also, what about the\nfact that there is no successor candidates among the new\nleaders?\n\nRLK: I was interviewed in early 2012 by a well-known\nAmerican television network and the question put to me,\nin January of that year, was, “isn’t Xi Jinping going to be a\nvery weak leader because he was not appointed by Deng\nXiaoping and he has no strong base of support?”\n\nTESL\n\nA\n\nSOLAR POWER ARRIVES IN PUERTO AI\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023679",
