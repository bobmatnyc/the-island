He\nwas talking with Dr. Lynn and the dog just reached out and bit him, tore his pants\nand broke the skin. He said he had been friends with Dr. Lynn and Margrit for\nmany years but it was just unsafe for anybody and any animals in the area.\n\nBobby Goodnough said he was jogging in the area and the dog lunged at him\ncausing him to have to dive through a twelve (12) foot hedge to get away from it.\nHe said he just thought it was a matter of time before the dog got a person or a\nchild. Sgt. Krauel asked if Mr. Goodnough had reported the incident to the police\ndepartment or had a time frame for when it occurred. Mr. Goodnough said he had\nnot made a police report but it occurred about two (2) years ago.\n\nLaura Klein, 130 Seaspray Ave., said she had lived here for 12 years, having\nmoved here from Washington, D.C. for a sense of security. She said she was now\nin the process of installing surveillance cameras. She said she could no longer\nwalk her dog without constantly looking around, worrying if Duke had once again\nescaped from the open gates. She said it is a privilege to own a dog and dog\nownership and responsibility should go hand in hand. She said Dr. Lynn was\nissued a citation in August of 2002 for locking his dog in a car with the windows\nrolled up. She said she mentioned this to prove his irresponsibility. She said his\nvoluminous file from Animal Care and Control would attest to this. She said no\none was safe while Duke is in Palm Beach.\n\nJames Merola was present on behalf of Dr. Lynn and said he was present on a\nrevised Notice of Code Violation and Hearing dated July 15, 2008. He said he\nwas not denying there were incidents with Duke. Palm Beach County had the dog\ntaken into custody and the hearing was held June 5, 2008. At that hearing, it was\nagreed upon by the County and Dr. Lynn that the dog would be classified as\ndangerous. The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain\nrestrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to\nhim. In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but\nsome reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.\nMr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the\nCounty to do what they required. Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn then received a\nletter, dated June 16, 2008 from the police department, mentioning the order of\nthe County and stating for the first time, the Town was declaring the dog\ndangerous and giving him ten (10) days to appeal, which he did not. On June 20,\n2008, four (4) days after the dog was declared dangerous by the Town, the police\ndepartment sent a second letter, citing 10-45 (i), advising that since the dog\nalready had two incidents, they wanted it removed or euthanized. The dog had not\ndone anything since being declared dangerous. This letter did not mention an\nappeal, but he sent a letter anyway, stating that they did not agree with that. He\nsaid the dog was declared dangerous on the 16\", requirements were imposed and\nthey complied with those, including the filing of a $1000 bond and they did not\nagree the dog should now be removed. There was a Town Council hearing on\nAugust 8\" and the Council said they needed to have the dog removed or\neuthanized. Mr. Merola went into detail about the requirements of 10-45 and said\n\n2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016582",
