  "text": "Precious metals\n\nPreference: neutral\n\nGold (24 Oct): USD 1,7020z (last month: USD 1,764/oz)\nUBS View (gold) Gold 6-month target: USD 1,875/oz\n¢ So far we saw inflows into gold of around 4 million ounces via physically backed ETFs since Bernanke's\nspeech at Jackson Hole. We expect this trend to continue and to lead to an undersupplied market, with\nfinancial demand also finding its way into gold futures and physical gold bars and coins.\ne Additional demand support comes from central banks, which are likely to further increase their foreign\nreserve allocation to the yellow metal. At the same time the drag from India's jewelry demand is set to fade\nwith an already lower base in 2H11 and a stabilizing Indian rupee.\n¢ Securing sufficient investment demand to push prices sharply higher is different from securing the\nneeded demand over a long period of time, and along these lines we see less support for the price over a 6-\nmonth perspective. Secondly, from a portfolio perspective we currently prefer to take some risk off the\ntable instead of on, and we thus maintain our neutral stance on gold.\n\nA Positive scenario 6-month target: USD 2,250/oz\n¢ Unorthodox monetary policy measures by the Fed start to weaken the USD persistently. Moreover, the\nrisk of a Eurozone breakup intensifies, which triggers a tidal wave of investment demand for gold.\n\n& Negative scenario 6-month target: USD 1,450/oz\ne A hard landing of China and India or the Fed backing off from the recent monetary policy\nannouncements would be a key drag on the yellow metal. The latter would have the strongest impact.\n\nWhat we're watching\nPhysical demand/supply\n\nWhy it matters\n\nIn the months ahead, with the festive season in India starting and monsoon\nactivity having improved considerably, supporting rural incomes, Indian\nphysical demand is likely to pick up. Key dates: World Gold Council mid-\nNovember release.\n\nMining activity in South Africa is unlikely to return to normal in the coming\nmonths. Hence, we are closely tracking mining news from South Africa,\nincluding the aggregated PGM IP numbers to assess the overall situation.\n\nIn order to see the gold price reaching our target, investment inflows into\nphysically backed ETFs need to continue. To gauge investor interest in gold\n(sector) a build-up in futures positions is likely to materialize as well.\n\nKey dates: 2 Nov US payrolls; 8 Nov ECB meeting, 12 Dec Fed meeting\n\nInvestment flow\n\nMonetary policy\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\nTactical (up to 6 months)\n\nAlthough it is possible for gold to test its\nall-time high in the next three months, we\nare aware that the metal has already\nappreciated firmly ahead of the QE3\nannouncement, which requires an ever\ngrowing amount of investment demand\nto hold the current upward trajectory.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\nTo protect investors’ portfolios from\nunorthodox monetary policy measures,\nholding gold exposure is a viable and\nattractive strategy. Alternatively, we\nrecommend palladium as well as\nplatinum. Structural supply issues with\nregard to platinum and a reduction in\nRussian stock sales of palladium speak in\nfavor of PGM exposure, despite higher\nvolatility.\n\nMoney created per hour\n(in mn USD)\n\n60\n\nValue of new gold mined (Valued at USD\n1,7 70loz,\n\nUSD created (via QE3 only)\n\nPer hour.\n\nSource: WGC, Bloomberg, UBS, as of Oct. 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025282",
