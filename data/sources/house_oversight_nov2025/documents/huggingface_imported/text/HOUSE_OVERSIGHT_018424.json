  "text": "the nature of physics brilliance. Boeing 747s lumbering across the Pacific towards\nSan Francisco for decades faced the sweaty problem of cancelled landings as they\ncircled above a fogged in airport, fuel running lower. The introduction of\n“autolanding” systems in the solved this for good. No big plane diverts from a misty\nfield; it lands itself. AI offers the possibility of a kind of auto-land for our biggest\nphysics puzzles, bringing them safely through a fog of data, theory and wrong ideas.\nBut with this weird price: We may not fully understand why the answers are right.\n\nAll around us Al-enabled systems will extend our ability to calculate and learn, to\npenetrate all sorts of foggy problems. They will sharpen our sadly dimming\nmemories, keep us safe and even help us create. Just as those Al-enabled airplanes\nalready make it impossible for pilots to fly into the ground, so computer wisdom\nmay protect us from crashes of our own: Too much financial risk. Bad educational\nchoices. (Poor music suggestions on a first date.) They will rely on their vast,\ninstantly updated networks to tell us things we can’t see or would never notice in\nthe first place: Don’t visit that office, everyone’s sick. They will use the ability to\nmodel thousands of possible outcomes of any choice to provide us with\n“feedforward” - an ability to learn from the future and not merely the past. Or, they\nwill know to jam our brain full of the right chemicals at the right time: Here’s a Diplo\ntrack to put you in the mood to go forarun. You really need to exercise, Dave.\n\nJust as an age without connected devices will one day seem strangely antique, so\nwill a world without the constant touch of AI. Recall Benjamin Franklin’s famous\nlament in the 1780s, that he’d sadly been “born too early” to enjoy the fruits of\nreason Starting to spill into his world as a result of the Scientific Revolution. Well,\nyou and I (and scientists like Silk and Ellis) may have been “born too late” for an age\nof purely human cognition; the habits of connected thinking already inform our\ndecisions and mark roads to new knowledge. The inevitability of Al reflects an\ninescapable logic at work now: We want faster better and smarter systems. We want\nto compress time. But the faster our world gets, the more it slips beyond a pace of\nhuman management. Al steps in. It makes the system function faster. Keeps itself\nsafe. Us too.?62 Better-than-human Al inside these “representational” grids doesn’t\nvanish like it did in Maes’ lab. In fact, an honestly artificial intelligence is their\nnature of their strange essence. They will use it not simply to contemplate the\nworld, to help us along, but also to confront what has never been seen, to see and\nthen coldly manipulate any topology of power they can reach. Of course we'll still\ncontinue to think about the world; but the world, a wired and alive and cogitating\ncage, will think about us too.?63\n\n262 Us too: Heinl, p. 53\n263 Of course: Nigel Thrift and Shaun French, “The Automatic Production of Space”,\nTrans Inst Br Geogr NS 27 309-335 2002\n\n192\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018424",
