I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the\nDaily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein:\n\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/201 1-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-\n\nepsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/\n\nCan you confirm if the following quote is accurate?\n\n\"If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do\nwith his money and his time, and support knowledge,” says Krauss. \"Jeffrey has surrounded himself with\nbeautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I\nalways judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've\nnever seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would\nbelieve him over other people.\" Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein,\nKrauss insists, \"I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.”\n\nThanks,\nRebecca Watson\n\nLawrence M.
