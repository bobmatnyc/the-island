The girl may refile the\nsuit after she turns 18 in May\nand can make her own deci-\nsions, Herman said.\n\nOther alleged victims also\nhave contacted him, Herman\n, ' said. “I do anticipate more\n\ncases,” he:said.\n\nIn the latest litigation, Jane\n\nDoe No. 3 alleges that she\n\nwas recruited by a former col-\n\nlege student, Haley Robson,\nto give Epstein a massage for\nmoney at his waterfront home\n\nlate in 2004 or early in 2005.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that,\nwhile on the massage table,\n\nEpstein sexually touched\n\nJane Doe No. 3, then mas-\n\nturbated. She is suing on\n\ngrounds of sexual assault and\nintentional infliction of emo-\n\ntional distress.\n\n“She felt intimidated. She\nfelt scared,” Herman said.\nJarie Doe No. 3-made only the\none visit to Epstein’s home,\nhe said.\n\n“Its just another copycat\nlawsuit filed by the same\nlawyer who appears less\ninterested in the truth than\nin grandstanding with these\npress conferences,” said Jack\nGoldberger, one of Epstein’s\nattorneys. “We now have\nsworn testimony that girls\nlied about their age to Jeffrey\nEpstein, and they were care-\n\nful in being convincing that.\n\nthey were over the age of 18.”\nHerman said Robson\ninstructed Jane Doe No. 3,\n“When he asks how old you\nare, tell him 18 or 19 years\nold.” But he said it doesn’t\nmatter. “They were underage\ngirls,” Herman said. “They\nwere sexually assaulted.”\n\nIn addition to the civil law-\nsuits, Epstein was indicted\non a single count of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution\nin July 2006 after a lengthy\nPalm Beach Police Depart-\nment investigation into his\nactivities with underage girls\nat his home. A resolution has\nbeen delayed continually. The\ncase is on Monday's court\ndocket but is expected to be\n\n_ rescheduled once again.\n\n“One of the reasons (Jane\nDoe No. 3) came forward is\nshe is tired of waiting for jus-\ntice,” Hérman said.\n@larry_keiler@pbpost.com\n\nB/E -HH- log062- 15\n\n(Indicate page, name of\nnewspaper, city and state.)\n3B / The Palm Beach Post\nWest Palm Beach, FL\n\nDate: 3/6/2008\nEdition\nTitle: Another suit alleges\n\nsex during massages\n\nCharacter\n\nor\nClassification: 37E-MM-108062\nSubmitting Office: MM\n\nf\n\n/\nad\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021526 >",
