I am headed to LA now for two events and meetings. Back \nlate Friday. I am thrilled we got my money. I loved the lawyer Martin telling me I deserved more. Made me \nhate my idiot brother even more. We are ahead of billing from last year and it's the quiet time. Will stay in \ntouch. How are you doing. Has all that vile publicity finally gone away for good or do the keep stirring the \npot for more blackmail money every few months. Hope you are well. Just spent the weekend at David Koch's \nin palm beach. He had a lunch for 70. Including 9 acting republican governors, Pataki, Giuliani, trump, Wilbur \nross, Was fascinating Xoxo.
