  "text": "4l\n\nand the Mediterranean. In the short period since the fall of the Soviet\nUnion, this has been impossible. There has been no great power with\nthe appetite and the will for such an adventure. But 15 years is not\neven a generation, and Israel must measure its history in centuries.\n\nIt is the nature of the international system to seek balance. The\nprimary reality of the world today is the overwhelming power of the\nUnited States. The United States makes few demands on Israel that\nmatter. However, it is the nature of things that the United States\nthreatens the interests of other great powers who, individually weak,\nwill try to form coalitions against it. Inevitably, such coalitions will\narise. That will be the next point of danger for Israel.\n\nIn the event of a global rivalry, the United States might place onerous\nrequirements on Israel. Alternatively, great powers might move into\nthe Jordan River valley or ally with Syria, move into Lebanon or ally\nwith Israel. The historical attraction of the eastern shore of the\nMediterranean would focus the attention of such a power and lead to\nattempts to assert control over the Mediterranean or create a secure\nMiddle Eastern empire. In either event, or some of the others\ndiscussed, it would create a circumstance in which Israel might face a\nBabylonian catastrophe or be forced into some variation of a Persian\nor Roman subjugation.\n\nIsrael's danger is not a Palestinian rising. Palestinian agitation is an\nirritant that Israel can manage so long as it does not undermine Israeli\nunity. Whether it is managed by domination or by granting the\nPalestinians a vassal state matters little. Nor can Israel be threatened\nby its neighbors. Even a unified attack by Syria and Egypt would fail,\nfor the reasons discussed. Israel's real threat, as can be seen in\nhistory, lies in the event of internal division and/or a great power,\ncoveting Israel's geographical position, marshalling force that is\nbeyond its capacity to resist. Even that can be managed if Israel has a\npatron whose interests involve denying the coast to another power.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031874",
