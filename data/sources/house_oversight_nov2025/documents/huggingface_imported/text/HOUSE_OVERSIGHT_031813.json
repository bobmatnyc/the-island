I still think that is the best idea. The \nstock is now down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding \nmergers. So I think it makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we \nhopefully get more clarity from management. \nPaul Barrett \nAlpha Group Capital LLC \n142 W 57th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019 \n<image001.jpg> \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 1:55 PM \nTo: Paul Barrett < > \nCc: Richard Kahn ‹> \nSubject: Re: AVGO \nlye had enough! !!!

I have some ideas \nwhich I will send you over the weekend if that is OK. \nRe Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been \na lot of focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we \nhear from management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. \nThis morning the pricing is as follows: \nAug 200 Puts cost $4.10 \nSept 200 Puts cost $7.90 \nEarning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept \nputs. However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management \nbefore August expiry. \nPaul \nPaul Barrett \nAlpha Group Capital LLC \n142 W 57th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019 \n<image003.jpg> \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 7:11 AM \nTo: Paul Barrett < \nSubject: \n>; Richard Kahn < \n> \nIm not angry, sorry, it is sad. it is apparent that you have no experience trading. we both made a \nmistake. . the spy trades were the results of a rank amatuer. . you took a postion on the direction of the \nmarket. ok. you decided to play it extra short time and short. . why? becaue the options are cheaper. \n? knowing full well that time premium was running. . first silly move. . I allowed as promised to \ngive you authority. . you set a target. . it hit the traget, you moved in back. based on media reporting on \ntrump visit? you didnt act. the market dipped and you panicked. . AMATEUR. wrong options wrong \ntiming , no discipline and as a percentaage of investment, a one day dip fof 25%. wanting to buy the \nhighter strike , is ok. but why the same month? why the same moment. why the same index. . sorry. I \nhave taught this for many years. and your grade is an F. not one good move in many. . re \nbroadcom. the crack happend in the morning, options were higher. no alternative presented. no \nanalysis. , this is no way to manage money.
