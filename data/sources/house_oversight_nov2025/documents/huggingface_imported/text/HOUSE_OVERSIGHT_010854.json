SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Before Wednesday of this week, you had none\nof the information that you just described about\nProfessor Dershowitz's testimony, correct?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. I'm trying to look at my notes here of your\nlong answer, but one thing you indicated that -- was the\nfact that Professor Dershowitz gave long answers is\nsomehow indicative of false answers or perjury --\n\nMR. SCAROLA: That is --\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. -- is that right?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: That is an absolute\nmischaracterization of the statement that\nProfessor Cassell made. He did not refer to the\nlength of the answers, but rather their\nnonresponsiveness.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Let me -- let me ask a different question.\nGo back to the flight logs themselves.\n\nA. Okay.\n\nQ. My initial question that got us going down\nthis line was: Isn't it true that the flight logs\n\nthemselves support Professor Dershowitz's testimony that\n\nhe was never on a plane with Virginia Roberts, the face\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n205\nof the flight logs support that proposition?\n\nA. The face of the flight logs for the relevant\nperiod of time, we can call it the hot period of time or\nwhatever you want, did not reveal the presence of\nMr. Dershowitz on those flights, yes.\n\nQ. Okay. So during the period -- well,\nactually, there's no flight log that shows Virginia\nRoberts and Professor Dershowitz on the same airplane,\n\ncorrect?\nA. That's my understanding, yes.\nQQ. And --\n\nMR. SCAROLA: By name. You're -- you're --\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: And it -~\n\nMR. SCAROLA: -- asking whether she was there\nidentified by name?\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. To your knowledge, isn't it correct that\nthere is no flight log that's been produced in this case\nby any party that reflects Professor Dershowitz and\nVirginia Roberts on the same plane, as you read the\nflight log?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry. Are you asking\nwhether those same names appear on the flight log\ntogether?\n\nMR. SIMPSON: My question, I think, is\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n00.55:08\n\n00:55:08\n\n0:55:08\n\n00:55:11\n\n00:55:12\n\n00:55:12\n\n00:55:14\n\nOn OO mh & bh «a\n\n00:55:15,\n00:55:17 9\n00:55:21 1 0\n00:55:23 1 1\n00:55:24 1 2\n00:55:26 1 3\n00:55:33 1 4\n00:55:39 1 5\noossaa 16\n00:55:47 1 7\n00:55:50 1 8\n00:55:54 1 9\n00:55:58 20\n90:56:02 21\n00:56:03 22\n00:56:04 23\n00:56:08 24\n00:56:08 25\n\n00:56:08\n00:56:11\n00:56:14\n00:56:17\n00:56:19\n00:56:21\n\n00:56:22\n\nON Oah © ND =\n\n00:56:24\n\n©\n\n00:56:25\nvose2e 10\nvose20 11\n0086.32 12\novse3s 13\noosess 14\nooseso 15\noo:s6s7 16\noos70s 17\noos710 18\noos713 19\noos714 20\noos7ts 21\noos7-16 22\noos716 2S\noos719 24\n00:57:20 25\n\nPage 204 to 207 of 335\n\n206\nperfectly clear.\nBY MR, SIMPSON:\n\nQ. My question, Mr. Cassell, is: You reviewed\nthe flight logs, correct?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. You reviewed them in some detail, correct?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. Is there any entry on those flight lines --\nlogs that you read as putting Professor Dershowitz and\nMiss Roberts on the same plane?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. And so your testimony about questions about\nthe completeness and accuracy of those flight logs goes\nto whether the logs are -- let me rephrase that.\n\nThe answer that you gave about your question\nas -- your views as to the completeness of the flight\nlogs and whether they may have been changed in some\nways, goes to whether those logs are conclusive, not\nwhether they, in fact, support Professor Dershowitz's\ntestimony that he was not on a plane with Virginia\nRoberts?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: I'm going to object to the form\nof the question as vague and ambiguous. I don't\nunderstand it.\n\nTHE WITNESS: And I won't give a long answer,\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(8954) 331-4400\n\n207\nbut I -- I think, as I previously indicated, you\ncan't just look at the face of these documents\nwithout -- with -- you know, against the context\nof an international sex trafficking ring that's\ntrying to cover up what it's doing. You can't\njust look and documents and assume that they are\n100 percent accurate without that -- having that\ncontext in mind.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Andso am I right, that on the face of the\nflight logs, there's nothing showing Virginia Roberts\nand Professor Dershowitz on the same plane?\n\nA. That's correct.\n\nQ. And -- goon.\n\nAnd so doI understand correctly that your\nposition is that the flight logs may not be complete or\nmay have been changed, but you do not dispute, that on\ntheir face, they support Professor Dershowitz's\ntestimony?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Objection.\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Objection.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Compound.\n\nTHE WITNESS: Could you just aggregate that?\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. You follow the objections very well.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n14 of 46 sheets\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010854",
