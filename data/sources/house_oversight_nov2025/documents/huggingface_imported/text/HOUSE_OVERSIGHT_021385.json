Curlin, M.D., a\nhospice and palliative care physician, researcher,\nand medical ethicist at the University of\nChicago. His empirical research charts the\ninfluence of physicians' moral traditions and\ncommitments, both religious and secular, on\nphysicians' clinical practices. As an ethicist he\naddresses questions regarding whether and in\nwhat ways physicians' religious commitments\nought to shape their clinical practices in our\nplural democracy. Curlin and colleagues have\nauthored numerous manuscripts published in the\nmedicine and bioethics literatures, including a\nNew England Journal of Medicine paper titled,\n“Religion, Conscience and Controversial\nClinical Practices.” As founding Director of the\nProgram on Medicine and Religion at the\nUniversity of Chicago, Dr. Curlin is working\nwith colleagues from the Pritzker School of\nMedicine and the University of Chicago Divinity\nSchool to foster inquiry into and public discourse\nregarding the intersections of religion and the\npractice of medicine.\n\nIn the world of contemporary medicine,\nscience is front and center, and for good reason.\nScience provides modern medicine with\nextraordinary diagnostic and therapeutic\ncapacities that can be employed to care for\npatients. Yet there is more to medicine than\nscience can know. Science cannot provide\nvisions to animate care of the sick, moral\nframeworks to guide the application of medical\ntechnology, or practices that nurture and extend\nour sociobiological capacity to care for others.\nFor these medicine turns to religious and secular\nmoral traditions and practices. This essay\nexamines how religious concepts are implicit and\noperative in practices of medicine and in the\nformation of fully human physicians. By\nattending to these concepts, we may gain a richer\nunderstanding of the way self-conscious human\npractices like medicine both depend on and\n\nPage |139\n\nSocial Brain, Spiritual Medicine?\n\nNo one ever asks what science\nhas to do with medicine any more than\nthey ask what books have to do with\neducation or what tools have to do with\ncarpentry. Before the middle of the 19th\ncentury, there was almost nothing that\nphysicians, however well intended,\ncould do to actually restore health to the\nill. Modern science changed that. Over\nthe past century and a half, dramatic\nimprovements in health outcomes have\nbeen wrought through the application of\nsterile surgery techniques, specialized\nhospital care, public health measures to\nprevent the spread of infectious diseases,\nantibiotics to treat those diseases, and\nmyriad subsequent technologies. All of\nthese have been undergirded by the\ndiscoveries of biomedical science.\n\nAs aresult, the life expectancy in\ndeveloped nations has doubled. People\nlive not only longer but with much less\ndisability. Diseases that formerly\ndisfigured and killed, such as smallpox\nand polio, have been almost completely\neradicated. Epidemics of malaria, yellow\nfever, measles and diphtheria have been\nrestrained. Injuries from war or other\ntraumatic events, which in earlier\nperiods led predictably to death or\nprofound disability, now can be\nameliorated using sophisticated surgical\nreconstruction techniques, advanced\nprostheses, and intensive rehabilitation.\nMedical science already has\naccomplished an extraordinary amount\nin alleviating human illness and\nforestalling death, and there is good\nreason to expect further progress. Yet,\nfor all that science has made possible,\nmedicine is animated by other, less\ntangible, forces.\n\nextend our unique, human, biopsychosocial\ncapacities.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021385",
