As seen in Exhibit 83, the ratio\nof municipal yields to Treasury yields is above\naverage for both 5- and 10-year maturities. In\nturn, investors can currently earn an extra 70\nbasis points of after-tax yield by owning five-\nyear municipal bonds instead of same-maturity\nTreasuries—a yield pickup more than double the\npost-crisis median of 31 basis points. Moreover,\nthis incremental after-tax yield would still be\naround 50 basis points if the top individual tax on\ninvestment income were reduced by 10 percentage\npoints—from 43.4% with the Affordable\nCare Act (ACA) tax to 33% under new policy\nrecommendations. In short, municipal spreads\ncurrently offer a potential offset to rising rates and\npotential tax changes.\n\nAlso keep in mind that municipal fundamentals\nremain stable. Major state and local tax revenues\nhave continued to increase at a moderate 3% pace,\nwhich should be supported by the above-trend\nUS economic growth and rising home prices we\nforecast. Meanwhile, governments have exercised\nrestraint on capital spending. Consider that net\nissuance expectations of $30 billion for 2017 stand\nwell below the pre-crisis 10-year annual average\nof $110 billion.'!5 This restraint has not only kept\n\nnet supply low—as new issuance has been largely\noffset by maturing debt—but has also helped\nmunicipal finances. Ratings trends have improved\nas a result of both stable revenue and spending\ndiscipline, with upgrades in the Moody’s universe\nseeing a notable uptick in last year’s third quarter\n(see Exhibit 84).\n\nOf course, underfunded long-term pension\nliabilities remain a source of concern. But with\naggregate funding levels holding steady at around\n74%, we do not think this will be a primary focus\nin 2017, particularly given last year’s increase in\nstock prices. While rising equity values will do\nlittle to remedy municipals’ inadequate funding\ncontributions, they will help increase the value\nof pension assets. Moreover, these medium-term\nconcerns are not the primary driver of recent\nmunicipal bond weakness. After all, today’s\nfunding levels are no worse than they were in\nOctober of last year, a time when municipal bonds\nwere enjoying some of their best returns ever.\n\nAll told, we expect intermediate municipal\nstrategies to gain about 1% in 2017. With\nthis return close to that of cash but with more\ndownside potential, we still think it makes sense\nfor clients to fund various tactical tilts from their\nhigh-quality municipal bond allocation. This\nrecommendation is motivated primarily by rate\nrisk and not credit concerns, since we expect\nmunicipal defaults to be rare events. Outside\ntilt funding, we recommend clients target their\n\n68 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014601",
