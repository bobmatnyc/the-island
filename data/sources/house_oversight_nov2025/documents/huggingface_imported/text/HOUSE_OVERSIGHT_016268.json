  "text": "in effect, immortal—removes robots from the world of the vulnerable (at least robots of\nthe usually imagined sorts, with digital software and memories). If this isn’t obvious,\nthink about how human morality would be affected if we could make “backups” of\npeople every week, say. Diving headfirst on Saturday off a high bridge without benefit\nof bungee cord would be a rush that you wouldn’t remember when your Friday night\nbackup was put online Sunday morning, but you could enjoy the videotape of your\napparent demise thereafter.\n\nSo what we are creating are not—should not be—conscious, humanoid agents but\nan entirely new sort of entities, rather like oracles, with no conscience, no fear of death,\nno distracting loves and hates, no personality (but all sorts of foibles and quirks that\nwould no doubt be identified as the “personality” of the system): boxes of truths (if we’ re\nlucky) almost certainly contaminated with a scattering of falsehoods. It will be hard\nenough learning to live with them without distracting ourselves with fantasies about the\nSingularity in which these Als will enslave us, literally. The Auman use of human beings\nwill soon be changed—once again—forever, but we can take the tiller and steer between\nsome of the hazards if we take responsibility for our trajectory.\n\n48\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016268",
