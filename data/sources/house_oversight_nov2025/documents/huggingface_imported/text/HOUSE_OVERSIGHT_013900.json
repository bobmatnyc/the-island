These people do not need\nto be the best, but just better than most. Offer them a digital master copy of the interview to do with or\nsell as they like (this is often enough) and/or offer them a small up-front or ongoing royalty payment.\nUse Skype.com with HotRecorder (more on these and related tools in Tools and Tricks) to record these\nconversations directly to your PC and send the mp3 file to an online transcription service.\n\n4. Do you have a failure-to-success story that could be turned into a how-to product for others? Consider\nproblems you’ve overcome in the past, both professional and personal.\n\nThe Expert Builder: How to Become a Top Expert in 4 Weeks\n\nL.. time to obliterate the cult of the expert. Let the PR world scorn me. First and foremost, there is a\n\ndifference between being perceived as an expert and being one. In the context of business, the former is\nwhat sells product and the latter, relative to your “minimal customer base,” is what creates good products\nand prevents returns.\n\nIt is possible to know all there is to know about a subject—medicine, for example—but if you don’t\nhave M.D. at the end of your name, few will listen. The M.D. is what I term a “credibility indicator.” The\nso-called expert with the most credibility indicators, whether acronyms or affiliations, is often the most\nsuccessful in the marketplace, even if other candidates have more in-depth knowledge. This is a matter\nof superior positioning, not deception.\n\nHow, then, do we go about acquiring credibility indicators in the least time possible? Emulating the\nclient-grooming techniques of some of the best PR firms in New York City and Los Angeles isn’t a bad\nplace to start.\n\nIt took a friend of mine just three weeks to become a “top relationship expert who, as featured in\nGlamour and other national media, has counseled executives at Fortune 500 companies on how to\nimprove their relationships in 24 hours or less.” How did she do it?\n\nShe followed a few simple steps that created a credibility snowball effect. Here’s how you can do the\nsame,\n\n1. Join two or three related trade organizations with official-sounding names. In her case, she\nchose the Association for Conflict Resolution (www.acrnet.org) and The International Foundation for\nGender Education (www.ifge.org). This can be done online in five minutes with a credit card.\n\n2. Read the three top-selling books on your topic (search historical New York Times bestseller lists\nonline) and summarize each on one page.\n\n3. Give one free one-to-three-hour seminar at the closest well-known university, using posters to\nadvertise. Then do the same at branches of two well-known big companies (AT&T, IBM, etc.) located\nin the same area. Tell the company that you have given seminars at University X or X College and are\na member of those groups from step 1. Emphasize that you are offering it to them for free to get\nadditional speaking experience outside of academics and will not be selling products or services.\nRecord the seminars from two angles for later potential use as a CD/DVD product.\n\n4. Optional: Offer to write one or two articles for trade magazines related to your topics, citing\nwhat you have accomplished in steps 1 and 3 for credibility. If they decline, offer to interview a\nknown expert and write the article—it still gets your name listed as a contributor.\n\n5. Join ProfNet, which is a service that journalists use to find experts to quote for articles. Getting PR\nis simple if you stop shouting and start listening. Use steps 1, 3, and 4 to demonstrate credibility and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013900",
