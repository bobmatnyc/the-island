It seemed very odd for someone doing an offi-\ncial criminal investigation to just call up on the phone like\nthat. I hadn’t heard Epstein’s name for years. I didn’t know\nwho this person was and what it was really about. I couldn't\ntell what was going on.\n\n36. This man said he was looking into Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe man asked if I had been involved with Epstein. My first\ninstinct was to say nothing because I wasn’t sure he was\nreally with the FBI or any authorities. I answered a few basic\nquestions, telling him that I knew Jeffrey Epstein and had\nmet him at a young age. But the conversation didn't feel right.\nThis man never offered to come and meet with me in person.\nInstead, he asked me right off the bat about Epstein’s sexual\npractices. I thought it would be strange for a true law enforce-\nment officer to behave that way, so I became increasingly\nuncomfortable and suspicious about who was actually call-\ning me.\n\n37. I told the man nothing more about Epstein. The con-\nversation probably didn’t even last three minutes, but it\nimmediately triggered all of the fears of Epstein and his pow-\nerful friends that had caused me to escape in the first place.\nIf the call accomplished anything, it only put me back in a\nstate of fear and told me that I could be found quite easily\nand had nobody officially protecting me.\n\n38. I suspected that the man who called me was working\nfor Epstein or one of Epstein’s powerful friends. I believed that\nif this was really an agent who was investigating Epstein, he\nwould have known who I was and how I fit into Epstein’s sex-\nual crimes in many different places. He would have inter-\nviewed me in a way that would have established his credentials\n\n247\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022054",
