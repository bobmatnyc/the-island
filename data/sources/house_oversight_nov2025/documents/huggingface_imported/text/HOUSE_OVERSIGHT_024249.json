(When I suggested recently to Epstein that\none obvious way to blunt the animus bearing down on\nhim would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back\nto jail.) His life, living it as he wants, seems to him to be\nan extraordinary accomplishment. Being on the wrong\nside of morality, custom, politics, feminists, the media,\nthat’s just a bit of bad luck.\n\nAnd it is perhaps this attitude of his that irks his\ncritics the most. Although he has spent more than a year\nin jail and paid out what may be as much as $20 million,\nhe yet seems somehow to have gotten away with it—\nthat worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catchall of\nup-to-the-minute badness: the financier whose wealth is\na product of Wall Street math rather than work; a rich\nmiddle-age white man who not only parades his wealth\nand entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an\ninsistent playboy (excuse me, pedophile) in a correct\nand prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get\nthe memo about vast changes in mores and culture.\n\nBut Epstein’s friends—and I think that is, in the\nend, the best word for the powerful people who orbit\nhim—are willing to take him as he comes. Epstein is\ntheir confidant. Not the only nexus of them, but one of\nthem. Dr. Epstein. Lay on my couch. As he is\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024249",
