Over the next two\nyears, we believe the category can generate over $350 mm in revenues, with upside if\nconsumer adoption of this particular form factor resembles the adult use market for\nTHC, or the growing popularity of nicotine vapor. We benchmark the market\nopportunity against the U.S. e-cigarette category, which we are forecasting to grow\n~32% in 2019 and ~27% in 2020, resulting in revenues surpassing $11 bn in 2020. In\naddition to e-commerce, we believe there will be distribution channel overlap with e-\ncigs, with a focus on vape shops and convenience stores (as opposed to just\ndispensaries). If vapor generates $360 mm in revenues in 2020, that would result in an\nimplied market share of 3.2%, roughly 10% of JUUL’s current U.S. market share.\n\nFigure 95 Vapor Will Be Smaller, But Can Grow To Almost $400 MM Figure 96 Our E-Cig Model Assumes Revenues Of ~$11 BN By 2020\nU.S. CBD Vape Sales ($ in mm) U.S. E-Cigarette Sales ($ in bn)\n$12.0 $11.1\n$400 I $360\n$350 I $10.0 $87\n$300\n: ain 56.6\n$250 ]\n$200 I 96.0\n$150 I 64.0 $3.6\n$100 I\nI $2.0\n$50 I\n$0 $0.0\n2018 2019E 2020E 2017 2018 2019E 2020E\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nThe below scenario analysis shows that every 50 bps of market share capture is worth\n~$56 mm in revenues.
