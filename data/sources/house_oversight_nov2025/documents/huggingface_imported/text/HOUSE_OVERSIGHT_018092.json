  "text": "Of course, it is difficult to know what is going on in the minds of\nIsraeli decision-makers. But the result seems clear: Netanyahu has\ndecided to mix deterrence with opportunity. Undoubtedly, he\nbelieves that the Arab revolutions will not be prepared to move closer\nto peace on his terms and that they will most likely make the current\npeace colder than the polar icecaps. However, Israel can live with\nfrigidity. Indeed, the Israeli right has never been keen to make the\nclimate warmer, let alone to turn Israel into a normal country at home\nwith others in the Middle East, a notion that seems to find few takers\nin Israel.\n\nAs is the case with epic narratives, the Arab spring and the Obama\ninitiative are two threads of a story whose coming together does not\nherald an end, but rather forms one out of many chapters. The fate of\nthis coming together is still difficult to determine. However, there are\nelements that seem to be propelling it forward, such as the recent\nFrench initiative offering to host a Palestinian-Israeli summit\nmeeting, which must be seen against the backdrop of the looming\nSeptember deadline when the Palestinians and Arabs plan to seek a\nUN General Assembly Resolution recognising a Palestinian state\nwithin the 1967 borders.\n\nFrance is clearly striving to score points for its new more active\napproach to the Middle East.

No Arab\nsummit has been convened, and the current secretary-general is\npreoccupied with his own political future in Egypt. Meanwhile,\nbilateral relations that have long rested on an Egyptian-Saudi footing\nare in some confusion.
