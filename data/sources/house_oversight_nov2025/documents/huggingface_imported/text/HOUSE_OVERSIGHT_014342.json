Chief Credit Officer Kevin Howard noted\nexpectations for net charge-offs to naturally tick up as recoveries become less of a\nbenefit and some seasoning in the loan portfolio. Recall during its earnings call,\nmanagement lowered its FY16 net charge-off range to 10-20bp (3Q: 12bp}. Mr.\nHoward noted that he would not be surprised if NCOs increased to 15-20bp in 2017\n(cons: 12bp) and stay near those levels for the near future.\n\n= Management reiterated its intent to continue to deploy excess capital.\nAlthough SNV will disclose a more detailed capital plan in January, management\nexpects to continue deploying excess capital via buybacks, M&A and/or organic\ngrowth. When asked how management should utilize its excess capital, 56% of the\naudience polled prefers SNV pursue M&A opportunities (vs. 8% last year). In\nreaction, Mr. Stelling noted continued interest in strategic acquisitions (like Entaire}\nbut hesitant to execute a large, dilutive transaction. While DTA accretion could allow\nfor continued share repurchase, management may choose to be a bit more\nopportunistic around buybacks given the run up in the stock.\n\nChart 41: What would you like to see management do with its excess capital?\n\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\nBe even more Increase the dividend Support faster organic Pursue M&A\naggressive on payout growth opportunities\nbuybacks\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\n= Management is positive but cautious on online lending partnerships. Investors\nwere also relatively split in how they view SNV’s partnerships with online lenders\nSoFi and GreenSky. The majority (57%) remains cautious on how these loans will\nperform during a credit cycle. Mr. Stelling agreed; however, he believes these\npartnerships represent the right vehicle to help the bank grow its retail portfolio to\n20-25% of loans (in line with its strategy to transition away from CRE) and achieve\nits 1.0% ROA target (3Q: 0.88%). Although we note that SNV is being deliberate\naround growing this book and is targeting these loans to grow to approximately 2-\n3% of total loans.\n\n28 2016 Future of Financials Conference | 17 November 2016 Bankof America 2\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014342",
