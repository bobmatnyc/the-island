These were the result of a\npostcard campaign instituted by the Inter-Yeshiva HS Council.\n\nThe article went on to point out that Lodge had also received letters from the Oklahoma students\nwho favored the proposal, as did some legislators.\n\nHowever, the opposition of religious groups to calendar reform—and it came from all\nfaiths—prevailed. The U.S. informed Secretary General Hammarskjold that it did not\nfavor any action by the UN to revise the present calendar. ‘Large numbers of the US\ncitizens oppose the plan,’ the U.S. note said. “Their opposition is based on religious\ngrounds...””\n\nWe were thrilled that our campaign—involving hundreds not quite the “large numbers”\nreported—had succeeded. We regarded it as a victory for religious freedom. It persuaded me\nthat even small efforts could have an impact on large organizations—a lesson that has stayed with\nme over my career. And it enhanced my admiration for the U.N., which had shown sensitivity to\nreligious minorities.\n\nDuring my high school years, my class made several visits to the U.N., where we watched the\nGeneral Assembly in action. We debated whether “Red China should be admitted to the U.N.” I\ntook the affirmative side. Several of us joined “the United Nations Association,” and we\nparticipated in “model U.N.” sessions, playing the role of representatives from particular\ncountries. No one could have predicted, in those days, how the UN would soon become an\norganization dominated by human rights violators and a bystander to, if not a facilitator of,\ngenocide, terrorism and other human wrongs by so many of its own members.\n\nWhat are human rights?\n\nDuring my college and law school years, most of my focus was on domestic civil rights. I\nmarched, attended rallies, trained for civil rights work in the South, and briefly traveled to points\nof confrontation in several southern cities, while carefully remaining out of harm’s way.\n\nAfter becoming a teacher and a lawyer, my involvement in the human rights movement\nbroadened, both academically and politically.\n\nIn my academic work, I began to explore the meaning of the term “human rights,” as contrasted\nwith “civil rights,” “civil liberties,” and “political rights.” To be an advocate of “human” rights\nmeant to me going beyond one’s particular group. A Jew who fights only against anti-Semitism is\nan advocate for particular rights, as is an African-American who struggles only against racism, a\nwoman who only opposes sexism, or a gay person who limits his advocacy to gay rights. These\nare commendable activities, but they do not qualify as advocacy of human rights. Just as joining\n“The First Amendment Club” requires the active defense of expression one deplores, so too,\njoining “the Human Rights Club,” requires an active commitment to the universal rights of all\n\n319\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017406",
