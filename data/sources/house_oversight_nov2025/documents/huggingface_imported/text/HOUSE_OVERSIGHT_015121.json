  "text": "“No, | mean my so-called marriage is all image. Pat and | have not,\nyou know, slept together for many years. My God, | was the President of\nthe Unites States, and | couldn’ t even get laid by my own wife.”\n\n“Sir, you don’ t really want to talk about this--\"\n\n“And I’ Il tell you where it started. During the Cuban Crisis in\nOctober ' 62. Boy, Kennedy sure won a helluva lot of points on that one.\nAnd it could’ ve been me confronting Khrushchev. | mean a real\ninternational shootdown, not just waving my finger at him in Safire’ s\ngoddamn makeshift kitchen.”\n\n“That would have been the logical extension of your Russian trip.”\n\n“| tell you, the unspeakable frustration of not being in a position to\nnegotiate that missile thing. | just couldn’ t get it up for Pat, plus the\npressure of the California campaign was going on then too. And after we\nlost that election, she started talking about a divorce. We compromised\nwith separate bedrooms.”\n\nSuddenly | stood up, walked around my desk to where Haldeman\nwas sitting, and | ran my hand back and forth across the top of his\ncrewcut. | am not very physically demonstrative, but | had always wanted\n\nto do that. Still, this was almost a spontaneous gesture.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015121",
