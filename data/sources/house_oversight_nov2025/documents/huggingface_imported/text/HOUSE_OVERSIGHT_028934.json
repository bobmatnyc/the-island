  "text": "argument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of secular\ndogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard sometimes. For\nexample, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs informs us that\nthe US, unlike other countries, has a “transcendental purpose,” and the fact that it constantly acts in contradiction to\nits purpose doesn’t matter because the facts are just “abuse of history” while real history is “the evidence of history as\nour minds reflect it,” then it’s hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There’s no point ridiculing virtually the entire IR\nprofession and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads to major human disasters.\n\nOn Davis, | frankly think that’s a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment\nrequire (including following the law), then she can quit and look for another job. As in any other such case.\n\nNoam\n\nFrom: Lawrence Krauss [mailto qs |\n\nSent: Thursday, September 10, 2015 1:51 AM\n\nTo: Noam Chomsky qq ; jeffrey £. <jeevacation@gmail.com>\nSubject: an article you may both hate. or like.\n\nhope all is well.\n\nLawrence\n\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/all-scientists-should-be-militant-atheists\n\nLawrence M.
