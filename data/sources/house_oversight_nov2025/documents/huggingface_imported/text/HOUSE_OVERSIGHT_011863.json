But to your dying day, you won’t\nbe able to look yourself in the mirror and explain why you waited for another 630\nIsraelis to die first.”\n\nHe did eventually start building it, but only in the wake of an act of terrorism\nwhich, even by the standards of this new and still-escalating intifada, was truly\nobscene. In March 2002, suicide bombers murdered 30 people, mostly elderly, as\nthey were celebrating the annual Passover Seder in a hotel dining room in Netanya.\nArik hit back two days later with Israel’s largest military operation on the West\nBank since 1967. Israeli forces retook major Palestinian towns, placed Arafat\nunder de facto siege in his headquarters in Ramallah and imposed curfews and\nclosures. In June, the government formally approved the security fence. Still,\nanother year would pass before the major part of the barrier was in place, by which\ntime some 500 Israelis had been murdered in the terror attacks. Only then did the\nnumber of casualties begin to fall.\n\nI tried to steer clear of public criticism of Arik’s government. One of the lessons\nI’d learned as Prime Minister was how easy it was to second-guess from the\noutside. No Prime Minister can act exactly as he might plan or want to. The most\nyou can do is make sure you understand and analyze the issues and follow your\ninstincts, experience and conscience to come as near as possible to doing what you\nbelieve is right. You will inevitably make mistakes and misjudgements. I certainly\ndid. At least some of the criticism I received was deserved. I was at times too\ninflexible. I tended to limit my focus to a small group of trusted aides and advisors.\nI was less good at schmoozing with — or, perhaps more importantly, delegating to —\nothers in the government or the party. I suspect it’s no coincidence that the man\nwho brought me into government in the first place was often criticized for the same\nthings. By character, instinct and experience, Rabin, too, remained less a politician\nthan a military man. Yet towards the end of his second period as Prime Minister,\nhe did get better at delegating to people around him, and creating an atmosphere\nthat encouraged teamwork, even when he knew he could not accept or act on\neverything they might suggest. During my term as Prime Minister, I was much less\ngood at that.\n\nBut another thing Yitzhak and I shared was a determination to set ourselves\nspecific goals and do everything we could to achieve them. I promised to get the\narmy out of Lebanon. With the Palestinians, I arrived in office convinced that the\nprocess begun in Oslo was both a huge opportunity and a potential dead-end.
