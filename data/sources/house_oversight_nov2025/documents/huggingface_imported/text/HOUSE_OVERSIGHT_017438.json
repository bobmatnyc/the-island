  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nIn my thirties, I made another significant choice. Having spent my first 5 or 6 years at Harvard as\na pure scholar, writing dozens of law review articles, two case books and hundreds of lectures, I\nwas becoming restless. I wanted more action. I “think therefore I am” (even if Des Carte got the\norder right) was not enough. I wanted to do. “I do, therefore I am,” is more consistent with my\npersonality and energy level. But I also loved teaching. I didn’t want to stop being a professor.\n\nI also have always hated to choose among good things. My choice has always been to do\neverything—not to miss anything. (““FOMS” again! I am terminal!) I never want to miss\nanything. My wife always reminds me of the great Yiddish expression: “With one Tuchis (rear\nend) you cannot dance at two weddings.” Maybe not, but there’s no harm in trying. And why\nonly two, if there are three. (My son Elon, a filmmaker, recently made a clever, short cartoon\nvideo, showing me breaking the Martha’s Vineyard record by attending five parties in one night!)\n\nAnd so, consistent with my lifelong aversion to choosing, I chose not to choose. I decided to\nremain a professor while also arguing cases and becoming deeply involved in causes.\n\nThe immediate precipitator of this change did not come from within me. It came from a tragedy\nthat struck my 10 year old son Elon, who was diagnosed with brain cancer. I dropped everything\nI was doing and focused all my energy on getting him the best surgical and oncological care in the\nworld. Following successful surgery at Boston’s Children’s Hospital, he had radiation therapy at\nStanford Medical Center in California. Then it was time to wait. Waiting—not doing—is\ndifficult for me. I simply couldn’t concentrate on long term scholarly projects that had no\ndeadlines. My mind wandered to my son and I could get no work done. I had to put on hold a\nmajor scholarly book project on the preventive state.\n\nI decided that what I needed was short term projects with deadlines that required me to complete\nthe work on schedule. Appellate cases fit the bill perfectly, and I began to take on criminal\nappeals.\n\nWhen Elon was diagnosed, I had no money. My salary was meager and I had no outside income.\nI had to borrow money from Judge Bazelon to assure Elon the best care. I vowed that I would\nnever again put my family in that position and I decided to try to earn additional income from\ncases. I took half my cases on a pro bono basis, but the other half earned me a nice outside\nincome, which I invested cautiously. I remember vividly charging my first legal fee: $35 an hour.\nI couldn’t believe anyone would be willing to pay me so much—almost 50 times as much as the\n75 cents an hour I had earned as a babysitter and Bar Mitzvah tutor! Within a few years it was\n$75 an hour, then a hundred. My goal was to be certain that if Elon experienced a recurrence, I\nwould have enough money to assure the best treatment without having to borrow. Fortunately,\nElon has been fine, but the years go by awfully slowly when you have a child at risk for\nrecurrence.\n\nOnce having dipped my toe in the water of practice, I wouldn’t stop. I loved the challenge of the\ncourtroom and took to it quite naturally. I’ve never looked back. Practice has made me a better\nteacher, and teaching has made me a better practitioner.\n\n351\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017438",
