  "text": "2. Schedule 30-minute interviews for Carol, Marc/Julie, and Rob. Use www.myevents.com\n(username: notreal, password: donttryit) to book them in my calendar for next week any time between\n9-9 ET.\n\n3. Find the name, e-mail, and phone (phone is least important) of workers in the U.S. who have\nnegotiated remote work agreements (telecommuting) despite resistant bosses. Those who have\ntraveled outside the U.S. are ideal. Other keywords could include “teleworking” and\n“telecommuting.” The important factor is that they negotiated with difficult bosses. Please send me\nlinks to their profiles or write a paragraph describing why they fit the profile above.\n\nLook forward to seeing what you can do. Please e-mail if you don’t understand or have questions.\nBest,\nTim\n\nThe truth is—I was at fault. This is not a good debut demand, and I made fatal mistakes even before\ncomposing it. If you are an effective person but unaccustomed to issuing commands, assume that most\nproblems at the outset are your fault. It is tempting to immediately point the finger at someone else and\nhuff and puff, but most beginner bosses repeat the same mistakes I made.\n\n1. I accepted the first person the firm provided and made no special requests at the outset.\n\nRequest someone who has “excellent” English and indicate that phone calls will be required (even if not).\nBe fast to request a replacement if there are repeated communication issues.\n\n2. I gave imprecise directions.\n\nI asked him to schedule interviews but didn’t indicate that it was for an article. He assumed, based on\nwork with previous clients, that I wanted to hire someone and he misspent time compiling spreadsheets\nand combing online job sites for additional information I didn’t need.\n\nSentences should have one possible interpretation and be suitable for a 2nd-grade reading level. This\ngoes for native speakers as well and will make requests clearer. Ten-dollar words disguise imprecision.\n\nNote that I asked him to respond if he didn’t understand or had questions. This is the wrong approach.\nAsk foreign VAs to rephrase tasks to confirm understanding before getting started.\n\n3. I gave him a license to waste time.\n\nThis brings us again to damage control. Request a status update after a few hours of work on a task to\nensure that the task is both understood and achievable. Some tasks are, after initial attempts, impossible.\n\n4.1 set the deadline a week in advance.\n\nUse Parkinson’s Law and assign tasks that are to be completed within no more than 72 hours. I have had\nthe best luck with 48 and 24 hours. This is another compelling reason to use a small group (three or\nmore) rather than a single individual who can become overtaxed with last-minute requests from multiple\nclients. Using short deadlines does not mean avoiding larger tasks (e.g., business plan), but rather\nbreaking them into smaller milestones that can be completed in shorter time frames (outline, competitive\nresearch summaries, chapters, etc.).\n\n5.I gave him too many tasks and didn’t set an order of importance.\n\nI advise sending one task at a time whenever possible and no more than two. If you want to cause your\ncomputer to hang or crash, open 20 windows and applications at the same time. If you want to do the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013884",
