Though we didn’t go into the details of the Iranian nuclear\nthreat, he did talk at some length about the implications for the region, and about\nbroader Middle Eastern security challenges. He displayed a grasp of the cultural\nand political nuances of an increasingly diverse and complex world that was more\nimpressive than many of the other American political or military leaders whom I’d\nmet.\n\nWhen he and I now returned to the issue of Iran, in the White House, he had an\nundeniable command of the details of Iran’s nuclear program, and of the American\nmilitary options, should he choose to use them. He opened by summarizing the US\nposition. He emphasized that his and our objective was the same: the keep Iran\nfrom developing a nuclear weapon. We were already cooperating to achieve that,\nfor instance through cyber-attacks to slow down the nuclear program. The\ndifference, he said, was that Israeli leaders seemed to feel an urgent need to reach a\ndecision on military action. In Obama’s view, such a move would be both\npremature and potentially harmful to the coalition he’d helped assemble to exert\ndiplomatic and economic pressure on Iran.\n\nMaybe you had to be an Israeli truly to understand our urgency about Iran. In\nthe early years of the state, the explanation we gave for our preoccupation with\nsecurity — our near-obsession, as some non-Israelis saw it — was that we were\nsurrounded by Arab countries pledged not just to defeat us, but erase us from the\nmap. Egypt or Syria, Jordan or Iraq, could afford to lose an Arab-Israeli war.\nIsrael’s first defeat, however, would be its last. That picture had changed\ndramatically over the decades. We no longer had to worry about the prospect of\nlosing a war. The “qualitative edge” we possessed over all enemy armies in the\nregion ensured that. As Israel’s chief of staff, Prime Minister, and now Defense\nMinister, I had made it a major priority to safeguard that advantage, not just\nthrough our alliance with the US but with the remarkable domestic resources we\npossessed in military engineering, manufacturing, design, invention and high-tech.\nBut the new-order challenge represented by Iran was not just theoretical or\nacademic. Though we had a policy of not commenting on on our own nuclear\nstatus, it was widely assumed in the Arab world and internationally that Israel had,\nat the very least, the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons. But whatever\nnuclear capability we might possess was for deterrence. Even when threatened\nwith conventional defeat, however briefly, in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, it is\n\n424\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028272",
