In turn,\nwe recommend that clients maintain their strategic\nweight in US equities, although we acknowledge\nthat risks have risen at the same time that returns\nappear likely to be lower going forward. While US\nequities are not yet running on fumes, we should\nkeep a close eye on the fuel gauge.\n\nEAFE Equities: Priced for Imperfection\n\nThere is no shortage of concerns surrounding the\nvarious countries that comprise Europe, Australasia\nand the Far East (EAFE) equity markets. The\n\nlist is both long and valid, including persistently\nlow economic growth, a slow pace of structural\nreforms and incessant political uncertainty, as well\nas incremental, reactive and inconsistent policy\nresponses. Ongoing questions about the health of\nthe banking system only compound these worries.\n\nBut these concerns are also not new and are\nconsequently well understood by the market.\n\nIn turn, the key question facing investors is not\nwhether EAFE exposure subjects them to downside\nrisks. As the preceding list demonstrates, it clearly\ndoes. The question instead is whether investors are\nbeing fairly compensated to bear these risks.\n\nOne can never know precisely what equity\nmarkets are discounting, but the above concerns\nare almost certainly a key driver of EAFE\nunderperformance and the main reason behind\n\ntoday’s larger-than-normal valuation discount to\nUS equities (see Exhibit 61). While this margin\n\nof safety does not guarantee outperformance,\n\nit may provide investors with a larger buffer to\nabsorb adverse developments and miscalculations\nin their forecasts. In our view, the risk/return\nprofile of EAFE equities is more attractive than it\nfirst appears.\n\nAs a result, we do not recommend that\ninvestors underweight EAFE equities. In fact, there\nare reasons to believe that EAFE equities will\noutperform US equities in local currency terms\nthis year. In the sections that follow, we explore\nthese reasons by examining the three main EAFE\nmarkets, beginning with the Eurozone.\n\nEurozone Equities: The Onus Is\non Earnings\n\nEarnings have been going nowhere fast for\nEurozone equities. That’s apparent in Exhibit\n\n62, which shows that profits have been range-\nbound—at nearly half their 2007 peak level—for\nalmost four years. As a result, rising valuation\nmultiples have accounted for all of the 25% price\nappreciation over this period.\n\nThis seeming contradiction between stagnant\nearnings and rising multiples reflects the copious\nliquidity provided by the ECB’s quantitative\neasing.
