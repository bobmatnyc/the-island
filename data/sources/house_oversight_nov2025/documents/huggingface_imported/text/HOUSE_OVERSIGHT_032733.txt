i think this is a good point Jeffrey but i do think they are rarely sacrificed—certainly not Saddam or the sadistic
Assads or Donald

have you heard that Genghis Khan—for all 1 know a gentle nomadic warrior—left 5 million Y chromosomes in
his wake, surviving today?

45% of marriages in Iraq are with first cousins of the doubly paternal kind—father's brother's child and this has
been said to lead to easy fracturing of the country which only a powerful dictator like Saddam could contain

of course "we" destroyed the country and it lies in ruins now—one end to the other
leave tomorrow for Ft Lauderdale and then Sunday on to California

as always, if you have an hour or so i will be there

all best

dear men

iam writing you both because i am attaching a still not-quite-complete response to Peter Richerson, a gene-
culture co-evolutionist—without the genes

i do so because four lines down i tell the "Gruterites"—-Gordon Getty's echo chamber—that i have added you
two to the list

so here is your chance to say "no way" and 1 will delete that from the message and likewise not ask Gruter's
assistant to add your names to the list

having said that, i find Gordon's missives much less burdensome than those from EDGE and certainly without
the egomaniacal nonsense that infects John Brockman—the key is to get the brightest minds in a room and

have them tell each other what they think is most important—or some such nonsense

neither David nor i can think of a single scientific advance achieved that way—most of what we do is simply
concentrated sustained thought directed toward the foundations of a problem

i doubt Jeffrey has made a huge amount of money via the EDGE program
