  "text": "Researchers have measured\nhuman brain responses using a variety of\nmethods such as functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI), which\ndemonstrate reliable effects of changes\nin neural activity by changes in blood\nflow. Although slower to respond than\nmeasures of electrical activity, {MRI\nprovides evidence about where neural\nactivity in the human brain occurs. This\nkind of research does show that\nobserving action produces activity in\nareas of the human brain more typically\nassociated with executing action. While\nthere may be some disagreement about\nwhich motor areas of the human brain\nare active while observing or imitating\naction and how these would correspond\nto areas in the monkey brain, there is\ngood agreement that the human motor\nsystem responds for observation and\nimitation of action.’\n\nThere is quite a difference\nbetween recognizing an action and\nunderstanding that action. We can see a\nhand move through space with an open\npalm oriented with the flat of the palm\nmoving toward the surface of an object\nand predict where the hand will strike\nthe object and that it will apply force to\nthe surface of that object. But\nunderstanding the same general action as\npushing a door open with the intent to\nenter and slapping a person in the face is\nquite different. A ball can be thrown in a\ngame of catch or as a missile intended to\ndo harm. The actions may be similar but\nthe intentions are different. Therefore it\nis important that some researchers have\nargued that mirror neurons respond to\nthe intention as well as the action.”\nHowever, to date there has been no clear\nevidence that such neurons respond to\nintention -- just that the sight of the\naction of reaching without an object to\ngrasp, the sight of the object alone, and\n\nPage |80\n\nthe sight of the action with the object\npresent show different patterns of brain\nresponse. The fact that such different\nvisual experiences lead to different\npatterns of brain activity does not\nprovide clear evidence that intentions or\ngoals are somehow part of the mirror\nneuron response to observed action.\n\nUnderstanding spoken language as\naction understanding\n\nThe potential ambiguity of action\nis perhaps clearest if we consider\nlanguage. Talking is a form of action and\nunderstanding speech might be a form of\naction understanding. In talking, mouth\nmovements are made in such a way as to\ncreate sounds that will have some affect\non the listener, as discussed in Howard\nNusbaum’s chapter. Listeners must\nunderstand what was meant by making\nthose sounds. However, if someone says,\n“Tt’s hot in here,” or “You are a great\nfriend,” there can be ambiguity about the\nmeaning. Such sentences could be\nstraightforward observations as they\nseem to be or they could be something\nvery different. We can ask to have a\nwindow opened or we can make a\nnegative social comment using exactly\nthe same sentences.\n\nNonetheless, there is good reason\nto believe that the human action system\nis involved in understanding speech as\nwell as producing it. While some\nambiguities in speech or behavior simply\ncannot be resolved without broader\ncontextual knowledge, the motor system\nmay be important in understanding. If\nyou try to have a conversation in a noisy\nbar, looking at your friend talking makes\nit easier to understand what is being said.\nWe have shown that the motor system\ncontributes to this process of recognizing\nspeech. When listeners can see\nsomeone’s face while talking, mouth\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021326",
