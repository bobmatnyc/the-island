That is often true, but when\n\nit's plaintiff's statement in a news article, it's calleda\nparty admission.\n\nPlaintiff complains that she didn't have the\n\nopportunity to depose President Clinton. Your Honor,\n\nplaintiff's counsel sought to depose President Clinton in their\nreply brief at the end of June, 2016, about a week before\ndiscovery was to close. They didn't even mention it in their\n\nopening brief, they raised it in docket number 211.\n\nIn that request, which I didn't have an opportunity to\nobject to because it came in reply, she said she wanted to\n\ndepose him to, \"establish his close personal relationship with\n\nEpstein\", she said nothing about wanting to s whether he had\nbeen on the island, whether he flew in a helicopter, or\nanything like that.\n\nWith regard to Louie Freeh, your Honor, we disclosed\n\nhim as a witness in our Rule 26 disclosures last March --\n\nxcuse m February of 2016. Plaintiff made no effort to try\nto depose him, made no effort to find out his basis of\nknowledge. We produced in discovery his report in which he\nsubmitted a FOIA request.\n\nYesterday, you will recall Ms. McCawley testifying\n\nabout how she, herself, issued a FOIA request and got in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011352",
