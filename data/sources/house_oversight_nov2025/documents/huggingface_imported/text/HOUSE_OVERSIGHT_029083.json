  "text": "Christian West that believes in the underpinnings of that and believes in the precepts of\nthat and want to see that bequeathed to other generations down the road as it was\nbequeathed to us, particularly as you're in a city like Rome, and in a place like the Vatican,\nsee what’s been bequeathed to us — ask yourself, 500 years from today, what are they\ngoing to say about me? What are they going to say about what I did at the beginning\nstages of this crisis?\n\nBecause it is a crisis, and it’s not going away. You don’t have to take my word for it. All\nyou have to do is read the news every day, see what’s coming up, see what they’re putting\non Twitter, what they’re putting on Facebook, see what’s on CNN, what’s on BBC. See\nwhat’s happening, and you will see we’re in a war of immense proportions. It’s very easy\nto play to our baser instincts, and we can’t do that. But our forefathers didn’t do it either.\nAnd they were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to\nbequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind, so I think\nit’s incumbent on all of us to do what I call a gut check, to really think about what our role\n\nis in this battle that’s before us.\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
