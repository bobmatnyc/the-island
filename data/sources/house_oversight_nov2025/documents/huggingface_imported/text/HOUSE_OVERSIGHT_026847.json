  "text": "trump revolution in the reshaping of the global architecture. The\nappearance of pressing transnational problems should drive a convergence\nof interests toward cooperation in finding common solutions. And the\npresence of large, well-educated middle classes in countries around the\nglobe will help keep governments on the right track.\n\nThere is every reason to be confident that the condition of the world will\ncontinue to improve as pragmatism and the use of reason become universal.\nWestern universities have been a crucial driver of this trend. It is not just\nthat their curricula have been copied around the world; the entire ecosystem\nof a modern research university is being replicated, and it is the graduates of\nthese Western-style universities who have in turn introduced modern\nmethods into education, public health, economic management, and public\npolicy more generally. Global management consulting firms have also\ncontributed to progress, spreading best practices and good ideas from the\nWest to \"the rest,\" and increasingly from the rest back to the West. As a\nresult, even formerly desperate and dysfunctional countries, such as\nBangladesh and Ethiopia, are now confidently entering the modern\nuniverse.\n\nIn short, despite the daily headlines that scream doom and gloom, the world\nis actually coming together, not falling apart. So far, the fusion of\ncivilizations has been driven primarily by the injection of Western DNA into\nother civilizations. Over time, the flow of culture and ideas is likely to go in\nboth directions. This has already happened in cuisine, where global\ninfluences have thoroughly penetrated Western kitchens, and something\nsimilar should happen across cultural sectors.\n\nThere will be challenges. There could even be major setbacks. The fusion of\ncivilizations and the social and economic changes associated with it can\nseem threatening to some, creating opportunities for demagogues to exploit\npopular fears, even in the heart of the advanced industrial world. But\nincreasingly open and enlightened societies are likely to avoid this danger.\nIn the twenty-first century, the world will be governed more by the authority\nof ideas than by the idea of authority. In short, the progressive direction of\nhuman history, which has lifted the human condition to heights never seen\nbefore, is set to continue.\n\n=== Follow Larry on\nTwitter\nat @LHSummers\n\nFollow Larry on Facebook Visit Larry's website\n\nat at www.larrysummers.com\nFB/LarrySummers\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026847",
