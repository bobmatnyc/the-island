  "text": "returned (though of course not whatever HIV-resistant genes may have been selected\n\namong the Africans).\n\nDivergent human populations often show very similar patterns of strong selection for\ngenes though different in time--thus Europe and Yoruba-land showed similar peaks in\n\nparasite resistant selection, though 10,000 years ago in the former and 8500 in the latter\n\nIncidentally very striking that cases of strong outbreeding, e.g between sapiens and\nneanderthalensis resulted in us acquiring ~3% of our genome from them, half were local-\nenvironment genes—fair skin, less hair on back, blue eyes and red hair on head—and half\n\nPARASITE-RESISTANT GENES (MHC genes).\n\nLikewise interbreeding between ‘us' and Denisovens in Tibet helped us acquire alleles\n\nuniquely suited for high altitude and, once again, resistance to local parasites.\n\nLogic is obvious--if you are moving into Europe for the first time you are adapted to the\nparasites from which you came (malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, this that and the third\n\nAfrican disease) but not those in the area you are invading (smallpox, the plague)\n\n3--Human genetic diversity declines as people move from Africa outwards--why? Serial\nfounder effect. It is always a sub-group of the larger group that decides to go over the\nnext mountain and colonize the valley. They can rapidly reconstitute numbers but not lost\ngenetic diversity—trepeated over and over you see a steady decline in genetic diversity\nfrom Africa to mid-East Europe Asia (Russia) and finally into arctic America and right\n\ndown to southern America within ~1000 generations\n\nHence Amerindians highly vulnerable to invasion of Europeans + Africans, bringing in\nsmall-pox, the plague, malaria, dengue fever to which they were highly vulnerable. Ever\nsee pictures of adult Indians with their entire outer skin peeling off as they died hideous\n\ndeaths from smallpox? Did you know that part of the genocide was to pass out “smallpox\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025145",
