However,\nfundamentals for the sector are actually improving relative to recent history. The sector\nis the biggest direct beneficiary of corporate QE in the UK and Euro are (more than half\nof the sector are eligible for the ECB’s Corporate Sector Purchase Program) meaning it\ncan gain more than most other sectors from potential refinancing savings. This cushions\nany effect on debt costs from higher bond yields as corporate bond yields are still very\n\nlow.\n\nEarnings and cash flow are improving. The bottoming out of the commodity cycle has\nsupported a turn to the upside for power prices. This has helped earning to trough and\n\nanalyst revisions have been positive throughout the last few months of\n\nunderperformance. Balance sheets and dividends in most cases now also look\nsustainable. Valuation multiples for the Utilities sector are attractive relative to history\nand compared to other Defensives. EV/EBITDA for the sector sits at 7.3x on Bloomberg\nestimates. That is a 20% discount to the market and is near 10-year lows on a relative\nbasis. With dividends more secure the relative DY becomes more attractive at 2-year\n\nhighs.\n\nChart 82: Utilities EV / EBITDA relative to market near10-year lows\n\n1.10\n1.05\naa Utilities\n1.00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n\n0.75\n\nFY1 EV/EBITDA relative\n\n0.70\n07/05 07/07 07/09 07/11 07/13 07/15\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nChart 83: DPS more secure now but the relative yield is at 2yr highs\n\n1.70\n1.60\n1.50\n1.40\n1.30\n1.20\n1.10\n1.00\n0.90\n\n0.80\n02/04 = 02/06 = 02/08 = 02/10 (022 = (02/14 02/16\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n\n—— Utility 12m fwd DY relative\n\nBankof America\nMerrill Lynch\n\nEuropean Equity Strategy |O01 December 2016 35\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014494",
