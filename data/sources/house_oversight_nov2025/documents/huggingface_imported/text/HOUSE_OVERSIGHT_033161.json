  "text": "director of the Palm Beach County Education Commission touted the area’s\nbenefits. I surveyed real estate and office space surrounded by miles of\nwater without once having my foot stepped on by a tourist. You can see how\nall this might sway someone who’s on the fence.\n\nExploring the sugary beaches of South Florida, one starts to wonder why\nWall Streeters would be on the fence at all. Between the smiling locals and\nthe shopping on Worth Avenue, the Hiaasen-esque stereotypes recede.\nWhat remains are the facts: Take-home pay is higher, commutes are\nshorter, and it’s just as fabulous as Manhattan, at least for four months of\nthe year. Meanwhile, no one in Florida even owns an ice scraper. With the\nInternet allowing more and more money managers to perform their work\nfrom nearly anywhere, there are few reasons not to make the move.\n\n“Initially, it was a way to play golf and keep the wife and kids happy,” says\nBrett Langbert, managing director and head of sales at I.A. Englander & Co.\n“But once we moved down, it became a quality-of-life issue. There are\nunlimited things the kids can do outside. I have to tell you, my wife and I\nare so happy we haven’t had to go to one of those indoor bouncy-castle\nplaces since we got here.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033161",
