  "text": "42\n\nIsrael's reality is this. It is a small country, yet must manage threats\narising far outside of its region. It can survive only if it maneuvers\nwith great powers commanding enormously greater resources. Israel\ncannot match the resources and, therefore, it must be constantly\nclever. There are periods when it is relatively safe because of great\npower alignments, but its normal condition is one of global unease.\nNo nation can be clever forever, and Israel's history shows that some\nform of subordination is inevitable. Indeed, it is to a very limited\nextent subordinate to the United States now.\n\nFor Israel, the retention of a Davidic independence is difficult. Israel's\nstrategy must be to manage its subordination effectively by dealing\nwith its patron cleverly, as it did with Persia. But cleverness is not a\ngeopolitical concept. It is not permanent, and it is not assured. And\nthat is the perpetual crisis of Jerusalem.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031875",
