  "text": "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians\n\nChapter 8\nBack to the Future\n\nUntil recently, a distinguishing feature of modern\nauthoritarianism was the ruling group’s ability to con-\nsolidate political power without resorting to the brutal\ntactics that defined the mainstream dictatorships of\nthe 20th century.\n\nThe political leadership maintained control of the\ncommanding heights of the media while tolerating\n\na small group of critical outlets as a safety valve for\ndissent and in order to tout the existence of diverse\nopinions in the news. Reformist nongovernmental\norganizations (NGOs) were allowed to operate, but\nnot to grow or gain traction. The regime used violence\nagainst its critics, but only sparingly, targeting a few\ndissidents or independent journalists as a deterrent to\nothers. And they were careful to keep the number of\npolitical prisoners to a minimum.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, modern authoritarian\nregimes generally refrained from overt acts of hostility\ntoward their neighbors. Some, such as China, boasted\nof a policy that sought harmonious, mutually ben-\neficial relations with other regional states. Turkey\nsimilarly claimed a policy of “zero problems” with its\nneighbors in the period before the Syrian civil war.\n\nFreedom House's Tyler Roylance has described a\n“common set of concessions\" that 21st-century au-\nthoritarians made to the prevailing democratic ethos\nin the wake of the Cold War, when these regimes were\nbalancing domestic political control with the need\n\nfor deeper integration into the global diplomatic and\neconomic systems:\n\ne Economic openness: Rather than attempting\nto preserve a closed, command, or autarkic\neconomy, the typical “modern authoritarian”\nregime cultivated extensive connections with\nthe outside world, creating a sense of freedom\nand prosperity. However, state enterprises and\ncrony tycoons retained a dominant position, and\npliant legal systems allowed the leadership and\nother corrupt officials to set and routinely reset\nthe terms of economic participation for foreign\ncompanies, investors, and local entrepreneurs.\n\ne Pluralistic media: Formal prepublication censor-\nship and media monopolies were abandoned in\nmost cases, clearing the way for a proliferation\n\nof commercialized, well-produced, and often\nentertaining media outlets. But the state and its\nagents retained direct or indirect control of key\nsectors, manipulated mainstream news cover-\nage, and kept truly independent journalism on\nthe margins of the information landscape.\n\nPolitical competition: Most regimes allowed\nmultiparty systems to emerge, and held regular\nelections, but opposition parties were fabricat-\ned, coopted, or defanged in practice, allowing\nthe ruling group to retain a de facto monopoly\non power.\n\nCivil society: Nongovernmental organizations\nwere permitted to operate, but they were kept\nunder close watch and forced to compete with\nstate-sponsored groups. Organizations focusing\non apolitical topics like public health or educa-\ntion often received less scrutiny than critical\nhuman rights activists, who were variously\nbelittled, harassed, or suppressed.\n\nRule of law: Twentieth-century authoritarian sta-\nples like martial law, curfews, mass arrests, and\nsummary executions were largely left behind,\nand force began to be used more selectively,\n\nso that most of the population rarely experi-\nenced state brutality. Dissidents were punished\nthrough the legal system, with its vaguely word-\ned laws and obedient judges, and in cases where\nextralegal violence was used, state authorship\nwas either hidden or not acknowledged. Only\ncertain ethnic minorities faced naked military\nforce or deadly police tactics.‘\n\nWhile more calibrated and less expansive\nmethods of repression are the defining feature\nof modern authoritarianism, the past few years\nhave seen a reemergence of older methods that\nundermine the illusions of pluralism, openness,\nand integration into the global economy.\n\nThe most extreme departure from the modern\nauthoritarian policy of balancing national am-\nbitions with participation in global governance\nwas Russia's invasion of Ukraine and annexation\nof Crimea. No breach of international standards\nof that magnitude had been committed since\n\nbz\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019286",
