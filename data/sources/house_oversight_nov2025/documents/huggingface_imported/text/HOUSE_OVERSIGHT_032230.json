We are gathering background research on the major candidates \nfor President. \nSeeing that both former President Clinton and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the Jeffrey Epstein \ncase, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that could help explain \nMr. Epstein's dealings and interactions with both men. \nI would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation at your \nearliest convenience. \nPlease let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet. \nMany thanks, \nMatthew \nMatthew Mosk \nProducer, ABC News \nW°r1 \nMobile: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032230",
