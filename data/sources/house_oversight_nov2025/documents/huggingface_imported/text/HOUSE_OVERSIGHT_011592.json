  "text": "We had just a few hours to adapt the original plan. Although we’d trained in\nclose-quarters fighting for my plan to attack the officers’ club near Damascus,\nwe'd never had to use that skill in a live mission. Nor had we ever used the\nBerettas. While we’d disguised ourselves as enemy soldiers or military police\non our intelligence operations, this would be the first time we were taking on\nthe persona of civilian engineers, with the need to fool armed terrorists on the\nlookout for any sign of danger or betrayal. And for the first time in any of our\nmajor operations, we would be operating in daytime.\n\nNow that nearly all our soldiers and officers had arrived, I began arranging\nthe final line-up of attack teams. We would need six rather than four, since the\nnew plan would give us access to the front and rear doors. Danny now also told\nme that a couple of the El Al technicians had shown him a way of climbing up\nfrom inside the nose wheel into the cockpit. One of the toughest and strongest\nof our soldiers, Uri Koren, had tried it successfully on the El Al 707. I told\nDanny, Uri and another officer that they would be assigned to attack through the\nfront door and the nose wheel. I put Uzi Dayan in charge of the tail door. The\nemergency doors above the wings, however, still gave us the quickest way in. I\nplanned to command the operation from the left of the aircraft, because both the\nfront and tail doors also faced that way. I entrusted Bibi Netanyahu and his team\nwith breaking in through the main wing door on the far side of the plane.\n\nBy noon, we got a further boost. With the resumption of incoming flights,\nwe began collecting air marshals. One in particular raised my confidence. I\nknew Mordechai Rachamim well from the sayeret. He was a Yemeni Jew from\nElyakhin, the moshav near Mishmar Hasharon where Baddura and the other\nYemeni workers lived. He was tall, strong and athletic, naturally agile and quick\nto respond in situations of danger. He was also no ordinary air marshal. In 1969,\nhe’d been posted on an El Al flight from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv. On a stopover\nin Zurich, four gunmen from Fatah’s main radical rival in the PLO, the Popular\nFront for the Liberation of Palestine, leapt out of a car, opened fire with AK-47s\nand began throwing grenades. The PFLP assault injured four of the crew and\nkilled the co-pilot. Armed with his Beretta, Mordechai rushed to the cockpit\nwindow and returned fire. Seeing the attackers were too far away, he slid down\nthe emergency chute. Once on the tarmac, he shot one of the terrorists in the\nhead and kept the rest of them at bay.\n\nAs additional air marshals arrived, I slotted each of them into an assault team\nin place of one of our sayeret soldiers. The next to arrive was Marco Ashkenazi,\na Cairo-born veteran with whom I’d worked on a mission inside Egypt. I put\n\n121\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011592",
