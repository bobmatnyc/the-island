A. Andropov and C.E.\nChaikin. Another relatively early classic is Nonlinear Oscillations by Nicholas\nMinorsky. The most common form of transition from a fixed point to a limit cycle was\npictured as changes in the surface of the action, the bow/-hillock manifold in the\nparagraphs above, and is called a Hopf bifurcation. Recall that bifurcation means a\ndiscontinuous change in an observable over a continuous change in what is known\nas a control parameter, such as dose of amphetamine or intensity of an experience.\nThe mathematical mechanism resulting in circular directional motion represented by\nthe (eigen)vectorial states, was named for the German mathematician, Eduard\nHopf. His 1942 paper was a mathematical proof of its existence and was discussed\nin the context of fluid flows that role up such that circling vortices arise from smooth,\ncalled jaminar, water flow, at a critical value of the flow rate. Hurricanes are another\nexample of these kinds of dynamics.\n\nThe Hopf bifurcation to limit cycles has been found in several, many\ndimensional, physical, chemical and biological systems. The latter include calcium\nconductance oscillations in the excitable membranes of muscle, heart and the brain,\ncardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular flutter as well as oscillations in population\nnumbers in foxes and rabbits, predator-prey systems. California Institute of\nTechnology’s Professor, James Old and Johns Hopkins Professor, Joseph Brady\nmade experimentally obvious the potential for the rigid irrationality implied by the\nbrain’s inclination to be locked up into limit cycle behavior. They demonstrated that\nanimals, from rats to monkeys, could get locked up in apparent self torture,\nrepeatedly and endlessly pushing a bar to deliver current to pain systems in the\n\ntheir brains. These pushes induced almost unremitting screams in monkeys and\n\n155\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013655",
