  "text": "Investment grade corporate bonds\n\nPreference: overweight\n\nCurrent global spread (24 Oct): 150bps (last month: 173bps)\nUBS View Spread target (6-month): 140bps\n\n¢ Given the recent rally in investment grade (IG) bonds, spreads have approached fair levels, in our view\nand are likely to trade more or less sideways in the coming 6 months. Still, IG bonds will likely continue to\noutperform government bonds, offering low volatility and stable income.\n\n¢ We lower our spread target from 170bps to 140bps due to the improved global macro and risk\nenvironment after recent central bank action and the pickup in economic data. IG bonds remain\nsupported by our outlook for sluggish but positive global growth, ongoing investor appetite for income-\ngenerating assets, and expected negative net issuance.\n\n¢ Non-financial corporates: While total yields are at record lows, the pickup over government bonds and\nmoney market rates is still attractive. Aggressive re-leveraging by companies looks unlikely.\n\n¢ Financial corporates: Due to regulatory challenges, spreads are expected to remain above past averages.\nUS banks are in a more favorable position than their European peers as they are better capitalized and\nearnings have been strong recently. US financial spreads are thus likely to tighten further.\n\n4 Positive scenario Spread target (6-month): 130bps\n\n¢ Global growth accelerates more forcefully than expected. This could compress spreads closer to pre-crisis\nlevels. Soreads for Financials are likely to remain elevated due to regulatory challenges. However, in this\ncase, rising benchmark yields would likely lead to slightly negative IG returns over six months.\n\n& Negative scenario Spread target (6-month): 380bps\n\n¢ Main risks include a sharp slowdown of the US economy (e.g. the \"fiscal cliff\"). Also, risks in the\nEurozone persist (e.g. Greek exit, Spain/Italy getting cut off from private funding). Still, we would be\nunlikely to see spread levels reached in 2009, given companies’ superior balance sheet positions. European\n\nfinancial issuers would be most at risk. Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nCore market yields Developed market sovereign yields are only expected to increase gradually. A\n\nsudden rise and high volatility would hurt IG credit. Key dates: 8 Nov, ECB\nrate decision; 11 Dec, US Fed rate decision\nCorporate fundamentals — Robust corporate earnings and low leverage on corporate balance sheets\n\nshould help prevent defaults. Key dates: US \"earnings season\" (ongoing)\n\nNew issuance As companies continue to deleverage, net negative supply on the IG market\n\nshould support higher prices.\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne We keep an overweight in IG corporate\nover government bonds.\n\ne In Europe, internationally diversified\ncompanies from non-financial sectors\noffer a low but stable income stream for\nconservative investors.\n\ne Financials in the US are in a better position\nthan their European peers.\n\ne We recommend bonds from the lower IG\nrating segments (BBB and A) over higher-\nrated issuers.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne We prefer corporate over sovereign assets\ngiven how much more robust companies\nare compared to the structural weakness\nof public finance in many countries.\n\nYield spreads\n700\nbps\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n\n—EUR Investment Grade — USD Investment Grade\n\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS, as of 16 Oct 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO’s asset class specialist Philipp Schottler, philipp.schoettler@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025273",
