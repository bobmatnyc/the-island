  "text": "Glossary\n\nAccountable Care Organization (ACO) -\nA health system model with the ability to\nprovide, and manage with patients, the\ncontinuum of care across different\ninstitutional settings, including at least\nambulatory (outpatient) and inpatient\nhospital care and possibly post acute care.\nACOs have the capability of planning\nbudgets and resources and are of sufficient\nsize to support comprehensive, valid, and\nreliable performance measurement. The\nACO model is one of the latest designs for\nmanaging healthcare costs and especially\nMedicare costs, and is gaining traction\namong policymakers desperate to control\ncosts and boost quality in healthcare.\n\nAccrual accounting - A system of\naccounting in which revenues are recorded\nwhen they are earned and outlays are\nrecorded when goods are received or\nservices are performed, even though the\nactual receipt of revenues and payment for\ngoods or services may occur, in whole or in\npart, at a different time. Compare with cash\naccounting.\n\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI) - All income\nthat is subject to taxation under the\nindividual income tax after \"above-the-line\"\ndeductions for such things as alimony\npayments and certain contributions to\nindividual retirement accounts. Personal\nexemptions and the standard or itemized\ndeductions are subtracted from AGI to\ndetermine taxable income\n\nwww.kpcb.com\n\nAlternative Minimum Tax (AMT) - A tax\nintended to limit the extent to which higher-\nincome people can reduce their tax liability\n(the amount they owe) through the use of\npreferences in the tax code. Taxpayers\nsubject to the AMT are required to\nrecalculate their tax liability on the basis of a\nmore limited set of exemptions, deductions,\nand tax credits than would normally apply.\nThe amount by which a taxpayer’s AMT\ncalculation exceeds his or her regular tax\ncalculation is that person’s AMT liability.\n\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment\nAct of 2009 (ARRA) - This act provided\nappropriations for several federal programs\nand increased or extended some benefits\npayable under Medicaid, unemployment\ncompensation, and nutrition assistance,\namong others. ARRA also reduced\nindividual and corporate income taxes and\nmade other changes to tax laws.\n\nAsset-Backed Security - Security backed\nby real estate or another type of asset; a\nclaim on an income flow, such as expected\ninterest payments on loans, payments on\nleases, royalty payments, or receivables; a\nclaim on the principal of a loan; or a claim on\nthe expected appreciation of an asset.\n\nAutomatic Stabilizers - Taxes that\ndecrease and expenditures that increase\nwhen the economy goes into a recession\n(and vice-versa when the economy booms)\nwithout requiring any action on the part of\nthe government. Stabilizers tend to reduce\nthe depth of recessions and dampen booms.\n\nUSAInc. xix\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021076",
