  "text": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\nnoted that the street lights in Palm Beach do not go off during turtle nesting\nseason. He said a field permit for trimming of the sea grapes at the Nightingale\nBeach Club Association was not recommended during the nesting season. He said\nthe indifference to materials he had brought forth more than a year ago that had\nnow been brought forth officially by the DEP were offensive to him and that is one\nof the reasons he had continued to “hammer” this. He said he believed the Board\nshould recommend to the Town Council that they remove this section of the Code,\ngiven the current environmental regime, especially when one considers the public\nrelations downside of fighting him on this issue and spending $2,000,000 to fight\nLake Worth on the other side. Mr. Maxey said this was probably not a win-win\nsituation and that NOAA had not even been brought into the fold yet.\n\nMr. Ochstein wanted to know if the Board was precluded from enforcing the\nordinance now. Mr. Walton said it should not be enforced now, that in speaking\nwith Mr. Wettstein from DEP and Ms. Higgins from FWC, an agreement had been\nreached to wait until the end of turtle season to require the trimming. The Town\nrecommends granting the Nightingale Beach Club until November 7, 2008 to come\ninto compliance. The permit is good until that date. In response to Mr. Hoffman’s\nquestion, Mr. Walton said the permit was issued on June 16, 2008. Mr. Maxey\nsaid he applied on March 19, 2008. Mr. Balletine inquired as to whether 7 days\nwas sufficient for compliance after the end of turtle season and Mr. Walton said it\nwas not a large area and he believed it was. Mr. Maxey said he did not believe it\nwas sufficient, that it would be an economic hardship if he had to replace every\ntree that is over 3 inches in diameter in order to get it below 6 feet and he brought\nup other issues involved with the trimming. Mr. Balletine told Mr. Maxey he just\nwanted to know, without going into a lot of detail, whether he could comply in a 7\nday period.. Mr. Maxey said that before he could remove any native plant, he had\nto first remove every single non-native one from the property and he had some\nquestions whether or not he could comply within that time period. He also said he\nhad some real questions about whether the law, both at the State and the local\nlevel, had been equally applied within the Town. Mr. Maxey said he is in\nconsultation with an attorney to find out what measures he can take. The Town\ndid not apply for a permit to cut its own sea grapes and judging from the\nguidelines he has in his permit, the Town would be in violation of almost everyone\nof those guidelines. The DEP counsel’s office asked him to provide photographs\nof the Town’s illegal cutting back in February.\n\nMr. Vanneck said there should be more research as to what should and should not\nbe cut. He believes the Town code may have gone too far.\n\nMr. Hoffman said the Board did not have the authority to modify the Code and\ncould only enforce the Codes as they had been written.\n\nMOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT THE VIOLATOR UNTIL\nNOVEMBER 7, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND IF\nCOMPLIANCE IS NOT ACHIEVED BY THAT DATE, TO ASSESS A FINE\nIN THE AMOUNT OF $250.00 A DAY UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED\nSECONDED BY MR. BSLTEN Be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016567",
