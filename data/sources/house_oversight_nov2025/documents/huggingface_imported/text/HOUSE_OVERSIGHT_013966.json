  "text": "It is fatal to know too much at the outcome: boredom comes as quickly to the traveler who\nknows his route as to the novelist who is overcertain of his plot.\n\n—PAUL THEROUX, To the Ends of the Earth\n\nL, this is your first time considering a commitment to the mobile lifestyle and long-term adventuring, I\n\nenvy you! Making the jump and entering the new worlds that await is like upgrading your role in life\nfrom passenger to pilot.\n\nThe bulk of this Q&A will focus on the precise steps that you should take—and the countdown\ntimeline you can use—when preparing for your first mini-retirement. Most steps can be eliminated or\ncondensed once you get one trip under your belt. Some of the steps are one-time events, after which\nsubsequent mini-retirements will require a maximum of two to three weeks of preparation. It now takes\nme three afternoons.\n\nGrab a pencil and paper—this will be fun.\n\n1. Take an asset and cash-flow snapshot.\n\nSet two sheets of paper on a table. Use one to record all assets and corresponding values, including bank\naccounts, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, home, and so forth. On the second, draw a line down the\nmiddle and write down all incoming cash flow (salary, muse income, investment income, etc.) and\noutgoing expenses (mortgage, rent, car payments, etc.). What can you eliminate that is either seldom used\nor that creates stress or distraction without adding a lot of value?\n\n2. Fear-set a one-year mini-retirement in a dream location in Europe.\nUse the questions from chapter 3 to evaluate your worst-case-scenario fears and evaluate the real\npotential consequences. Except in rare cases, most will be avoidable and the rest will be reversible.\n\n3. Choose a location for your actual mini-retirement. Where to start?\nThis is the big question. There are two options that I advocate:\n\n1. Choose a starting point and then wander until you find your second home. This is what I did with a\none-way ticket to London, vagabonding throughout Europe until I fell in love with Berlin, where I\nremained for three months.\n\n2. Scout a region and then settle in your favorite spot. This is what I did with a tour of Central and\nSouth America, where I spent one to four weeks in each of several cities, after which I returned to\nmy favorite— Buenos Aires—for six months.\n\nIt is possible to take a mini-retirement in your own country, but the transformative effect is hampered if\nyou are surrounded by people who carry the same socially reinforced baggage.\n\nI recommend choosing an overseas location that will seem foreign but that isn’t dangerous. I box, race\n\nmotorcycles, and do all sorts of macho things, but I draw the line at favelas ~ civilians with machine\nguns, pedestrians with machetes, and social strife. Cheap is good, but bullet holes are bad. Check the\nU.S. Department of State for travel warnings before booking tickets (http:// travel.state.gov).\n\nHere are just a few of my favorite starting points. Feel free to choose other locations. The most\nlifestyle for the dollar is underlined: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Cordoba), China (Shanghai, Hong Kong,\nTaipei), Japan (Tokyo, Osaka), England (London), Ireland (Galway), Thailand (Bangkok, Chiang Mai),\nGermany (Berlin, Munich), Norway (Oslo), Australia (Sydney), New Zealand (Queenstown), Italy\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013966",
