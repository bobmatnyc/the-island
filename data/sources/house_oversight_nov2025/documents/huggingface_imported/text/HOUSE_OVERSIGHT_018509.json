  "text": "When this article was first posted, a guy grabbed the first comment on the version that I\n\nposted to the feminist blog Feministe, protesting that I clearly don't get the men's side of\nthis equation. I don't usually get super angry about comments on the Internet, but in that\ncase I did, and I had to take a while to calm down.\n\nThere was a mild comment fracas. Eventually, in response to that guy, I wrote:\n\nI worked really hard on this article to try and note both:\n\nA) how men's perspective might make this difficult for them, but simultaneously\nB) why men's insecurities aren't actually an excuse for men to treat women badly.\n\nIn my experience women are actually extremely aware of men's insecurities. Women\nfrequently silence themselves and put up with a lot of crap because we are afraid of\n\"emasculating\" our man, as I specifically noted in the article.\n\nGiven that this was an article about:\n\n1) a woman's experience,\n\n2) and what it's like to be a woman,\n\n3) and why this issue is difficult to take on as a woman,\n\n4) and why women shouldn't allow men's insecurities to shut us up...\n\n... can you see why I would avoid putting a lot of text towards describing men's\ninsecurities in loving detail?\n\nNow. With that having been said....\n\nOne of the guys in the Clarisse Thorn Manliness Brain Trust (tm) emailed me with some\nthoughts in the wake of this article. Once again, I want to emphasize that I don't want\nanyone to feel that they \"ought to” give a crappy partner \"another chance” if that partner\nis treating them badly. I spent years giving a terrible boyfriend millions of second\nchances because I kept telling myself that he was just \"insecure.\" Walking away from\nthat oh-so-\"insecure\" man was one of the best choices I ever made. Nonetheless, I\nthink that the following comment from my Manliness Brain Trust (tm) friend might be\nuseful for some people:\n\nWhen I first saw this post, my first thought was that I have to pass it on to a couple of the\npeople I'm involved with, who have difficulty reaching orgasm because it's an awesome,\nawesome article. My second thought was that it seemed like Clarisse didn't really grok\nthe guy's side of this exchange.\n\nSomewhere among Sth, 7th and 9th thoughts, was the notion that I'd be a jerk to raise\nthat point in the comments. This article is a great reference for women working through\ndifficult climax issues and there's no need to drag the conversation off to the guy side of\nthe experience... So I sent Clarisse an email about it instead. Because the thing with\nUnification theories is that they're never all the way done. And things could have been so\nmuch easier for Clarisse if her boyfriends didn't suck. Maybe some insight into why they\nsucked would help with the ongoing development of the model, or at least provide some\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018509",
