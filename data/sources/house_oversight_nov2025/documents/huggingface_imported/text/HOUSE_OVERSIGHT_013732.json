  "text": "shift from hyperactivity to motor stereotypy (Paulus et al, 1991). Studies that\nfollowed demonstrated that “q-moment” distributions of heterogeneous scaling\nexponents and their relative statistical weightings were useful in making subtle\ndiscriminations between effects of psychopharmacological agents and behavioral\n(isolation) influences on animal behavior as well as patterns of simple psychomotor\nbehavior in normal subjects and schizophrenic patients (Paulus et al, 1994; 1996;\n1998; Krebs-Thomson et al, 1998a; 1998b).\n\nFractal Scaling Measures on Reconstructed Time Series from\n\nBiological Dynamics\n\nPublications involving the applications of various D measures, particularly Dz,\nto brain-relevant times series number in the hundreds and are growing\nexponentially. The following constitutes a brief review of a representative set of\nempirical findings. In doing so, for the reasons discussed below, we ignore what\nsome might consider the rather abstract and philosophical issue of “determinism”\nversus “randomness” or “error” (Sugihara and May, 1990; Casdagli, 1991; Wayland\net al, 1993; Kaplan and Glass, 1992; Kaplan, 1994) since this question is relatively\nunproductive with respect to generating new neurobiological insights, novel\nexperiments or new quantitative approaches to brain dynamics. In addition, as\nnoted in the final section, this discrimination may not even have definitive theoretical\nmeaning in that the conduct of much of the rigorous mathematics about\n“deterministic dynamical systems” involve Markoff partitions and matrices which are\nalso the generic operators of formal probability theory (Sullivan, 1979; Kolmogorov,\n1950). For example, N-dimensional non-linear Markoff processes can be shown to\ncapture the dynamics of multidimensional neurobiological processes such as the\nEEG (Silipo et al, 1998).\n\nWe have also ignored the related issue of the presence or absence of “low\ndimensional structure” (Theiler and Rapp, 1996; Rapp, 1995) which, from the\nauthors’ point of view, resulted from an unfortunately concrete interpretation of the\n\nword “dimensions.” With respect to experimental brain data, dimensions are defined\n\n232\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013732",
