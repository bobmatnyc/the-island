  "text": "Year after year, the power of the “foxes” grows.\n\nIt was the great Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto who noticed — among other\nthings — that no matter what kind of government you think you have, there are\n\nalways some crafty insiders, the “foxes,” who take control of it.\n\nPolicies are set, programs are started... decisions are made... with no consent\n\nof the people or their elected officials; the foxes work the angles.\n\nOver time, the forces of law and order become more and more corrupt... as the\n\nfoxes bend the entire system to do their bidding.\n\nWars are started with no plan or intention to win them. Money is handed out\n\nfor no better reason than this: They can get away with it.\nAnd best of all, most people are none the wiser; they believe the myths... and\nattack anyone who challenges them.\n\nRip-Off\n\nPerhaps the biggest rip-off of all time has taken place over the last eight years\n\n— and in plain sight of everybody.\n\nVia the magic of ultra-low rates, the Fed — a nest for the wiliest and most\ncunning of the foxes — took roughly $8 trillion out of the pockets of savers and\nretirees and handed it to borrowers.\n\nWho is the world’s biggest borrower?\n\nYes... it’s the Deep State itself.\n\nThe Fed claimed to be helping to “stimulate” the economy. But you can’t really\n\nstimulate an economy by stealing from the people who produce wealth and\n\nprovide it with capital.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028793",
