  "text": "official circles. The people may be surprised in the future with a new “Sykes-\n\nPicot Agreement”, other “Balfour Declaration” or even other “1967” and we\n\nhave lessons in the history of ancestors. The treachery and collusion have been\n\ndiscovered since 1948 until now make us fear everything and doubt in everything\n\nespecially that there are clear signs in the horizon.\n\nUnfortunately, the plotters, in Egypt and other Arab countries, will preach and\npromote to such visit and meetings as the savior of the region of its pests. They\nwill ignore the recent and distance past experiences, depending on the weak Arabic\nmemory. This matter should be warned in the light of Russian-US conflict on the\ndominance in Syria, Saudi-Iranian conflict on the dominance in Yemen, Sunni-\nShute conflict on the dominance in Iraq and Lebanon, and the Israeli presence in\nthe region. All of these mentioned conflicts are made by the United States.\nAccordingly, should we depend on Donald Trump or the new prince of believers\n\n(Caliph)?!\n\nAnyway, I want to remind you that Trump said: “I will get the Gulf states,\nwho are not doing much, believe me. The Gulf states have nothing but\nmoney. I’m going to get them to pay. We owe 19 trillion, we’re not paying\n\nfor it. Don’t forget, without us, the Gulf states won’t exist.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031739",
