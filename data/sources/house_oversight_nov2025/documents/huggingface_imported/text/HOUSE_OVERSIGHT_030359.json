  "text": "The subject of the email should have been warning enough for Jes Staley, the embattled\nchief executive of Barclays. At quarter to nine on Wednesday evening, after a bruising\nshareholders’ meeting, Mr Staley received a message purporting to be from his chairman,\nJohn McFarlane. The heading read: “The fool doth think he is wise”.\n\nIn fact, the message was from a prankster, using the Gmail account\njohn.mcfarlane.barclays@gmail.com. The imposter described Michael Mason-Mahon, an\nindividual shareholder who called for Mr Staley to resign at Wednesday’s annual\nmeeting, “as brusque as he is ill informed” and went on to reassure the Barclays chief\nexecutive that together they had successfully seen off any attempt to force Mr Staley out.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030359",
