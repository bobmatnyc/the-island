His residency and medical career were in danger. The young man was engaged to a\nwonderful woman and my friend knew he could not have been guilty of this offense. When I met\nwith him he explained that his fiancé would pick him up from work with her car after she\ncompleted work. She was to signal him when she was outside by calling his beeper. Because the\nhospital forbade use of the beeper for private calls, the young doctor always put it in his pocket\non vibrate. One day when he was talking to a nurse, the beeper went off in his pocket. Fearful\nthat she would see it, he fumbled around in his pocket to find the off switch. She misunderstood\nhis actions and that of the vibrating beeper for masturbation.\n\nI told him that he had to tell the truth, because the offense of using his beeper improperly was\ntrivial compared to the offense with which he was charged. He agreed. He asked me to speak to\nhis supervisor. I borrowed his beeper, put it in my pocket and went in to speak to the supervisor.\nAt a prearranged moment, he phoned the beeper and it began to vibrate in my pocket. The\nsupervisor saw my vibrating pocket. I quickly retrieve d the beeper and the case was over.\nDemonstrative evidence always works better than oral testimony.\n\n376\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017463",
