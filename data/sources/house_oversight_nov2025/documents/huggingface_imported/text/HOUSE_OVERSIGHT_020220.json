In his 1956 book The Torment of Secrecy: The Background and\nConsequences of American Security Policies, the sociologist Edward Shils brilliantly dissects the\nfascination with secrecy among individuals on all ends of the political spectrum who fear that\ngovernment agencies will use covert machinations against them. In Shils’ concept, this anti-\ngovernment counter-culture is “tormented” by the government’s possession of knowledge\nunavailable to them. Those who subscribe to this culture tend to believe that the agencies that\nhold these secrets, such as the FBI, CIA and NSA, can control their lives. The other side of this\ntorment over others holding secrets is the belief that by obtaining such secrets will give individuals\npower over government.\n\nSnowden himself was concerned with a coming “dark future,” which he later described as\nfollows: “[The elites] know everything about us and we know nothing about them — because they\nare secret, they are privileged, and they are a separate class... the elite class, the political class,\nthe resource class — we don’t know where they live, we don’t know what they do, we don’t know\nwho their friends are. They have the ability to know all that about us. This is the direction of the\nfuture but I think there are changing possibilities in this.”\n\nTo change the “dark future,” someone would have to know the secrets of the “elites.”\n\nSnowden saw himself as one of the few individuals in a position to seize state secrets from those\nelites. He had both a SCI, or Sensitive Compartmental Information, clearance, a pass into a NSA\nregional base and the privileges of a system administrator. This position allowed him to steal state\nsecrets—and whatever power that went with them. And if he moved to a position that gave him\ngreater access, he would, in this view, amass even greater power.\n\nWhatever his actual agenda in 2012, we know that he tested possible reactions to a leak\nexposing NSA surveillance in the United States. He asked fellow workers at the NSA base in\n2012, according to his own account: “What do you think the public would do if this [secret data]\nwas on the front page?” He asked this question at a time when a large number of State\nDepartment and US Army classified documents had been posted on Julian Assange’s Wikileaks\nwebsite. While these Wikileaks revelations of secrets were making front-page headlines, the NSA\ndocuments that Snowden had taken were far more explosive since they contained NSA\nintelligence secrets. And no NSA document had ever been published in the press in 2012. One\nreason why NSA documents remained secrets, as all intelligence workers at Dell were told when\nthey signed their oath, was that the unauthorized release of communications intelligence\ndocuments could violate US espionage laws.\n\nEven so, there was no shortage of activists overseas, such as Assange, who would be willing\nto publish NSA documents revealing its global surveillance activities. And in answer to his\nrhetorical question, he no doubt knew that they would cause an immense reaction on the front\npage. Cyber punks, as these activists called themselves, tended to be hostile to the NSA since they\nbelieved (correctly) that it monitored their activities on the Internet. This anti- NSA view was well\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020220",
