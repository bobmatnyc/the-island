  "text": "involves additional mechanisms beyond\nthe sharing of emotion and includes self-\nregulatory mechanisms to modulate the\nobserver’s experience of negative\narousal. Specifically, in order to\nunderstand the emotions and feelings of\nothers in relation to oneself, second-\norder representations of the other must\nbe consciously available and must not\nconfuse the other with the self. The\nmedial and ventromedial prefrontal\ncortices are known to play crucial roles\nin decoupling first-person and third-\nperson information and maintaining\nrepresentations of the other as distinct\nfrom the self (5).\n\nThe regulatory component of\nempathy, especially regulation of\ninternal emotional states and processes,\nis particularly relevant to the modulation\nof vicarious emotion and the experience\nof empathy as well as sympathy.\nEmpathy is unlikely to lead to helping\nbehavior if the observer is incapacitated\nby strong empathically evoked emotions,\nwhich is why emotional regulation is an\nimportant component in empathy.\nIndeed, children high in effortful control\nshow greater empathic concern, and the\ntendency to experience empathy and\nsympathy versus personal distress varies\nas a function of their ability to regulate\ntheir emotions more generally.\n\nHow We Perceive Other People in\nPain\n\nWhen witnessing another person\nexperiencing pain, the scope of an\nobserver’s reaction can range from\nconcern for personal safety, including\nfeelings of alarm, fear, and avoidance, to\nconcern for the other person, including\ncompassion, sympathy, and care-giving.\nThe existence of the perception-action\ncoupling mechanism apparent in\nemotional contagion also seems to\n\nPage | 88\n\naccount for our ability to perceive and\nunderstand the pain of others. In the case\nof pain, individuals are predisposed to\nfind distress of others aversive and learn\nto avoid actions associated with this\ndistress. This is even the case in many\nmammalian species, including rodents.\nFor instance, rats that had learned to\npress a lever to obtain food would stop\ndoing so if their response was paired\nwith the delivery of an electric shock to\na visible neighboring rat (6).\n\nRecently, a handful of functional\nneuroimaging studies performed with\nhealthy human volunteers revealed that\nthe same neural circuits implicated in\nprocessing the affective and motivational\naspects of pain in oneself account for the\nperception of pain in others (7). In one\nstudy, participants in a magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) scanner either\nreceived a painful stimulus or, in other\ntrials, observed a signal that their\npartner, who was present in the same\nroom, would receive the same stimulus.\nFirst-hand experience of pain resulted in\nactivation of the somatosensory cortex,\nwhich encodes the way we feel aspects\nof a noxious stimulus such as its bodily\nlocation and intensity. Furthermore, the\nanterior medial cingulate cortex (ACC),\nand the anterior insula were activated\nduring both first-hand pain and the\nanticipated experience of pain in\nsomeone else. These regions are\nresponsible for the affective and\nmotivational processing of noxious\nstimuli such as those aspects of pain that\npertain to desires, urges, or impulses to\navoid or terminate a painful experience.\nA number of other neuroimaging studies\nof empathy for pain in adults as well as\nin children have demonstrated that the\nsomatosensory cortex is not activated\nonly during first-hand pain but is also\nactivated with the perception of other\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021334",
