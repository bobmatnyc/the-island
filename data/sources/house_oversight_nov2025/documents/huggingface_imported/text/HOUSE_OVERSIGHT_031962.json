Likewise, while the nationalism of America’s principal\nrival, China, has become more assertive lately, the communist\nregime’s clear priority — indeed, the key to its stability — is domestic\neconomic growth.\n\nIndeed, the only obvious danger that the US faces stems from\nweapons of mass destruction, which could proliferate or be used by\nterrorist groups. But confronting this threat does not require a\nmassive military budget or huge deployments of US troops all over\nthe world.
