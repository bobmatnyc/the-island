  "text": "In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)\n\nThe character of support provided by al-Qaeda’s sponsors in the financial industry also took several forms, but in every\ninstance involved the knowing provision of financial services and other forms of material support to al-Qaeda. In certain\ncases, al-Qaeda officials were directly embedded in the infrastructures of those financial institutions, and al-Qaeda openly\nmaintained accounts and carried out transactions with the knowledge and consent of senior officials of the financial\ninstitution in question. For example, during the period that al-Qaeda was headquartered in the Sudan under the protection of\nthe ruling National Islamic Front regime, it openly used Defendants Al Shamal Islamic Bank (“Al Shamal’”) and Faisal\nIslamic Bank-Sudan (“FIBS”) to support its operations and terrorist agenda.* (Together with Defendants DMI Administrative\nServices S.A. (SDMI’’) and Tadamon Islamic Bank (“Tadamon”), Al Shamal *45 and FIBS are referred to herein as the\n“Sudanese Defendants”). According to the testimony of former al-Qaeda finance chief Jamal al Fadl, previously deemed\ncredible by this Court,*° Al Shamal maintained accounts for Osama bin Laden and several other al-Qaeda officials, and\ncarried out large cash and wire transactions in furtherance of al-Qaeda operations.” Al Fadl similarly testified that FIBS,\nwhich in turn is the founder of Al Shamal, partnered with al-Qaeda by mamtaining accounts for al-Qaeda and by embedding\nal-Qaeda officials in the infrastructure of Al Shamal.*' Tadamon also maintained accounts for al Qaeda members according to\nal Fadl, including an account for bin Laden’s personal bodyguard, who handled money for bin Laden and used the account\nfor bin Laden’s activities on behalf of al Qaeda.”\n\nMore frequently, al-Qaeda’s partners in the financial sector operated covertly within its global infrastructure, by providing\nfinancial services to al-Qaeda’s charity fronts with full knowledge that those accounts were being used to support al-Qaeda,\nand by themselves providing funds to al- *46 Qaeda, typically through their own zakat charitable contributions to al-Qaeda’s\ncharity fronts. The allegations and record evidence relating to Al Rajhi Bank and National Commercial Bank (“NCB”) are\nillustrative of this pattern of support. Testifying before Congress just three weeks after the September 11th Attacks, former\nCentral Intelligence Agency Chief of Counterterrorism Operations Vincent Cannistraro affirmed that “[t]here is little doubt\nthat a financial conduit to bin Laden was handled through the National Commercial Bank, until the Saudi government finally\narrested a number of persons and closed down the channel. It was evident that several wealthy Saudis were funneling\ncontributions to bin Laden through this mechanism.”@\n\nThe “mechanism” through which “wealthy Saudis” channeled support to bin Laden via NCB involved large transfers to\nIIRO, Muwafaq Foundation, Saudi Red Crescent, SJRC and other al-Qaeda charity fronts.* Conveniently, NCB maintained\naccounts for many of these ostensible charities, including in particular TRO and SJRC, and promoted *47 contributions to\nthose accounts via advertisements, with specific awareness that those entities were supporting al-Qaeda.® At all times, NCB\nwas aware of the terrorist activities of those purported charities, by virtue of the extensive public reporting concerning those\nactivities in the Muslim world prior to 9/11, and by virtue of the longstanding ties between senior executives of NCB\n(including its Chairman Appellee Khaled bin Mahfouz and Appellee Yassin al Kadi, who was the architect of NCB’s Islamic\nBanking Division), and bin Laden, as described in further detail below.” (Together with NCB and Abdulrahman bin\nMahfouz, Khaled bin Mahfouz and Yassin al Kadi are referred to here is ahe “NCB Defendants.”)\n\nAl Rajhi Bank played an analogous and equally important role in al-Qaeda’s financial infrastructure, by also providing\nfinancial services to al-Qaeda charity fronts including the MWL, IIRO, al Haramain, and Benevolence International\nFoundation.* In addition, Al Rajhi Bank funneled its own zakat contributions to al-Qaeda, via contributions to al- *48\nQaeda’s charity fronts.” Like NCB, Al Rajhi Bank was aware at all relevant times that MWL, ITRO, al Haramain and\nBenevolence International Foundation were fronts for al-Qaeda, again by virtue of the public reporting concerning the\nterrorist activities of those organizations, and because senior Al Rajhi Bank officials, including in particular the bank’s\nfounder Suleiman al Rajhi,” were themselves important al-Qaeda benefactors with direct ties to bin Laden dating from the\nAfghan jihad.”\n\nAppellees DMI Trust and DMI S.A., in turn, sat at the apex of a deliberately decentralized financial network, which included\nAppellees Al Shamal, FIBS and Tadamon, established for purposes of “pursuing financial jihad.” Functioning as the\noperational arm of DMI Trust and implementing the Trust’s strategies and objectives, including its material sponsorship of al\nQaeda, DMI S.A. handled accounts for al Qaeda members and primary financiers, including Wa’el Jelaidan and Yassin al\nKadi, *49 siphoned off charitable donations to support al Qaeda, and used its own zakat contributions to support al Qaeda.”\n\nAs referenced above, plaintiffs’ pleadings and supplemental materials allege that support for al-Qaeda’s agenda emanated\n\nWESTLAW\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023381",
