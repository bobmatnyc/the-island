  "text": "“Tell Motta we know about it,” I said. “We’ve planned for it. It’s not a\nproblem.” I figured there were at most four or five Lebanese soldiers manning\nthe checkpoint. The last thing they’d want to do is get involved in a firefight\nbetween us and the Syrians. But Motta’s reply was unequivocal. The mission\nwas off.\n\nWhen we’d climbed through a bramble-filled ravine back into Israel, I left a\nmessage for Motta. I found it hard to disguise my frustration, and my anger, at\nbeing ordered to abort the attack, especially after my assurances that the\nLebanese roadblock was not a problem. Yet when we got back to the sayeret\nbase, I realized there was more to his veto than I’d thought. He and Dado had\nreceived intelligence saying the Syrians were likely to make a series of further\ninspection tours of the border area, so this would not be our last chance. The\nnext day, we received word they’d be touring the western part of the border on\nJune 13. On the Lebanese side, it was known as Ras Naqoura, on ours as Rosh\nHanirkra, where the Mediterranean coastline rose dramatically to a ridge and,\nonce into Israel, sloped steeply down again toward Haifa.\n\nI took in two main assault teams, one led by Mookie, the other by Uzi\nDayan. We hid in a tangle of bushes about halfway along the road which\nclimbed up toward the border ridge. I stationed Bibi and his team at the bottom\nof the road, equipped with Uzis and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. We\nwaited, knowing that we’d be able to see the convoy as it twisted its way up\ntoward us. Again, I had no direct link to Motta. Yet both he and Dado were\nfollowing the mission from a command post in northern Israel. We were in\nnearly real-time contact through a sayeret officer, named Amit Ben-Horn, right\nacross the border.\n\nA first vehicle appeared at around 10:30 in the morning. Bibi radioed us. It\nwas a Lebanese army armored car with a single machine-gun. It drove past and\nhalted 150 feet on, at the point where the road began to climb. The two guys\ninside took out a small table and a couple of chairs and began brewing up coffee\non the side of the road. “All OK,” I said when I radioed Amit to tell him. “Pre-\ndeployment.” The convoy arrived two hours later and began to climb. “We’re\ntaking it,” I radioed Amit.\n\n“Wait,” he replied. And as I kept pressing him for the final go-ahead, another\n30 seconds passed.\n\n“Not approved,” he finally barked back at me, clearly wanting to make sure I\ngot the message.\n\n129\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027977",
