  "text": "These are rough times, but it’ s extremely important to develop a\nsense of optimism. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists periodically updates a\nclock on their cover to indicate how close we’ re moving toward nuclear\nwar. Recently they moved it from four minutes to midnight to three\nminutes to midnight, with midnight representing total annihilation. |\ndon’ t know exactly what their time scale is—whether one minute\nrepresents a month or a year or a decade—but, whichever, they’ re saying\nthat we are all now only three minutes away from the ultimate holocaust.\n\nThat’ s the bad news.\n\nThe good news is that atomic scientists are just as fucked-up as the\nrest of us. They overeat, they forget to floss, they don’ t have time for\nserial orgasms, or they suffer from premature ejaculations, and they set\ntheir clocks fifteen minutes ahead so that if they need to mail a letter by\nsix 0’ clock and their clock says it’ s ten after six, it means they still have\nfive minutes to get to the mailbox. So that clock on the cover of the\nBulletin of Atomic Scientists is fifteen minutes fast. We don’ t have just\n\nthree minutes till doomsday; we have eighteen minutes.\n\nzk k *\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015178",
