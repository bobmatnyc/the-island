  "text": "of Nowak’s research has to do with trying to “describe\ncancer mathematically.” (Epstein preempts Nowak’s\nexplanation : “Think of cancer the same way as you\nthink of a terrorist group. The NSA has been able to\nthwart a great number of terrorism acts by intercepting\ncommunication signals from one terrorist to another.\nThat same dynamic, a form of signal intelligence, of\nfinding a terrorist in Europe, can be used to intercept\ncommunication between cancer sells. Cancer cells\nmerely communicate in protean code rather than\nelectronic code. If you can decode what the signals are\nsaying you can jam those signal between terrorist\ncalls—essentially wipe out their cell phones. Likewise if\nyou can decode biological signals you can jam them too,\nthat’s the holy grail.’’)\n\nThen Richard Axel, a Nobel prize winner in\nphysiology. Then Ron Baron who has $26 billion under\nmanagement in his Baron Fund. Then Josh Harris, the\nco-founder of Apollo Global Management ($164 billion\nunder management) and owner of the New Jersey Devils\nand the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nWhat goes on at Epstein’s house confirms\neveryone’s worst fears about power and the powerful:\nthey are all in a secret and shared conversation. The\nworld runs on insider information. And, certainly, inside\nEpstein’s dining room, it remains a man’s world—a rich\nman’s world. Indeed his salons tend to offend most\nevery aspect of reconstructed gender and political\nsensibilities.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022905",
