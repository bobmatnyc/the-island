It was a shared tragedy and Moshe’s death—combined with my\nmother’s reaction to it—had a profound and lasting effect on my 9 year old psyche.\n\nMy friends and I formed a “club’”—teally just a group of kids who played ball together. We\nnamed it “The Palmach”—after the Israeli strike force that was helping to win the war. We\nmemorized the Palmach Anthem “Rishonin, Tamid Anachnu Tamid, Anu, Anu Hapalmach.” (\n“We are always the first, we are the Palmach”). Recently, I spoke to a Jewish group in Los\nAngeles and among the guests were Vidal Sassoon (the style master) and David Steinberg (the\ncomedian). Steinberg mentioned to me that when Sassoon was a young man, he had volunteered\nto fight for the Palmach (If you think that seems unlikely, consider that “Dr. Ruth” Westheimer\nserved as a sniper in the same war). I challenged Sassoon to sing the Palmach Anthem and before\nyou knew it, Sassoon and I were loudly belting out the Hebrew words to the amusement of the\nother surprised guests.\n\nIsrael declared statehood in May of 1948, when I was nine and a half years old. Following its\nbold declaration that after 2,000 years of exile, there arose a Jewish state in the Land of Israel,\n(supported by the United Nations, the United States, the Soviet Union and most western nations),\nthe nascent state was attacked by the armies of the surrounding Arab countries. That summer I\nwent to a Hebrew speaking Zionist summer camp called “Massad.” During my summer at Camp\nMassad (where the counselor of an adjoining bunk was a young Noam Chomsky, then a fervent\nleft-wing Zionist) we heard daily announcements over the loudspeaker regarding the War of\nIndependence. We sang Israeli songs, danced the hora and played sports using Hebrew words (a\n“strike” was a “Shkeya,” a “ball” a “kadur”.) The announcement I remember most vividly was\n“Hatinok Rut met hayom’”—the “babe” Ruth died today. But I also remember several\nannouncements regarding the death or wounding of Israelis who were related to the people in the\ncamp. One out of every hundred Israeli men, women and children were killed—some in cold\nblood, after surrendering—while defending their new state. Many of those killed had managed to\nsurvive the Holocaust.\n\nWe also learned of Stalin’s campaign against Jewish writers, politicians and Zionists. After the\nend of the war, Stalin became the new Hitler as we read about show trials, pogroms and\nexecutions of Jews. We hated communism almost as much as we hated fascism.\n\nThese early memories—relating to the America’s war against Nazism, Israel’s War of\nIndependence, and Stalin’s war against the Jews—contributed significantly to my emerging\nideology and world views.\n\nI grew up in a home with few books, little music, no art, no secular culture and no\n\nintellectualism. My parents were smart but had no time or patience for these \"luxuries.\" Our\nhome was modest--the ground floor of a two and half family house. (The finished basement was\nrented to my cousin and her new husband). Our apartment had two small bedrooms, the smaller\nof which I shared with my brother. We ate in the kitchen. The living room, which had the\nmandatory couch covered with a plastic protector, was reserved for special guests (who were\nrare). The tiny bathroom was shared by the four of us. The foyer doubled as a dining area for\nFriday night and Shabbat meals. The total area was certainly under __ square feet. But we had\nan outside—and what an outside it was! In the front there was a small garden and a stoop. In the\n\n16\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017103",
