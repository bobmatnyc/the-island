  "text": "5.4 Interpretation and Application of the Integrative Diagram 105\n\nsomething the integrative diagram doesn’t touch at all. This brings us again to the network of\nideas we’ve discussed under the name of \"cognitive synergy,\" to be discussed later on.\n\nIt might be possible to make something similar to the integrative diagram on the level of\ndynamics rather than structures, complementing the structural integrative diagram given here;\nbut this would seem significantly more challenging, because we lack a standard set of tools for\ndepicting system dynamics. Most cognitive theorists and AGI architects describe their structural\nideas using boxes-and-lines diagrams of some sort, but there is no standard method for depicting\ncomplex system dynamics. So to make a dynamical analogue to the integrative diagram, via\na similar integrative methodology, one would first need to create appropriate diagrammatic\nformalizations of the dynamics of the various cognitive theories being integrated — a fascinating\nbut onerous task.\n\nWhen we first set out to make an integrated cognitive architecture diagram, via combining\nthe complementary insights of various cognitive science and AGI theorists, we weren’t sure how\nwell it would work. But now we feel the experiment was generally a success — the resultant\nintegrated architecture seems sensible and coherent, and reasonably complete. It doesn’t come\nclose to telling you everything you need to know to understand or implement a human-like\nmind — but it tells you the various processes and structures you need to deal with, and which of\ntheir interrelations are most critical. And, perhaps just as importantly, it gives a concrete way\nof understanding the insights of a specific but fairly diverse set of cognitive science and AGI\ntheorists as complementary rather than contradictory. In a CogPrime context, it provides a\nway of tying in the specific structures and dynamics involved in CogPrime, with a more generic\nportrayal of the structures and dynamics of human-like intelligence.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013021",
