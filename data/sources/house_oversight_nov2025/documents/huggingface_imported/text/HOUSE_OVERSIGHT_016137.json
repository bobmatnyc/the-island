Low oil\nprices have dented the government’s direct ability to support the consumer compared\nto the boom years. Furthermore, negative to flat public sector wage growth is likely to\ndampen income and consumption trends, although Specialized Credit Institutions (SCIs)\ncould alleviate tightening banking sector household lending standards.\n\nThe NPT suggests a focus on boosting female employment as well as increasing the\ncost of foreign labor relative to national labor. The latter implies a negative impact on\ncorporate margins and profits, in the event higher labor costs are not reflected in higher\nconsumer prices and inflation). The negative near-term cost and efficiency implications\nof continued labour market reforms are mitigated by the fact that eventual increase in\nprivate sector employment of higher-paid Saudi labour should prove supportive for\nconsumption trends once the dust settles.\n\nThe NTP targets increasing the cost of employment of Saudis compared to expatriates\nfrom 400 to 280. We calculate that the ratio of private sector wages of Saudis\ncompared to non-Saudis stood at 3.64 and 1.29 for males and females respectively in\n2015. The NTP target is thus akin to increasing non-Saudi private sector wages by 43%\nover the period to 2020, a CAGR increase of 7.4%. This would squeeze corporate profits,\nlead to inflationary pressures in the economy, and lead to annual additional Fx outflows\nthrough remittances of US$2.8bn (0.4% of GDP). As such, it is more likely that the\nemployment cost of non-Saudis is likely to be increased through measures such as fees\nfor government services, taxes and levies. It is unclear that the NTP target can be met\nsolely through this route, but it would avoid additional Fx outflows despite still having a\nnegative impact on corporate margins and inflation, in our view.\n\nThe Nitaqat Saudization program is likely to be extended in the near-future through the\nforthcoming launch of the “balanced Nitaqat” initiative. While employment quotas are\nlikely to be tightened, they will also take into account wage levels, job quality and\nwomen employment ratios, according to local press. A likely target is likely to be\nincreased job creation for Saudis in the retail sector through higher quotas, in our view.\n\nOS Merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 27\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016137",
