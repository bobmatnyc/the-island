Air Force One\n\nView this email in your browser here.\n\nChart of the Day - Economy and Society\n\nDear Barry,\n\nWhen it comes to describing Donald Trump’s private jet, the word\n“impressive” would be an understatement. The presumptive Republican Party\nnominee bought the Boeing 757-200 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\nand he spared no expense kitting it out. Dubbed “Trump Force One,” the\nluxurious jet is equipped with a shower, gold-plated seatbelt buckles and a\n52-inch flatscreen with a library of 1,000 movies. Built in 1991, the 757 is\nestimated to have cost approximately $100 million. If Trump reaches the\nWhite House in November, he'll have to exchange his personal jet for the\npresidential fleet, two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs. The aircraft used by\nthe president were built in 1986 and operate with the Air Force One callsign\nwhen the president is onboard. Will switching jets prove one of Trump’s few\nregrets if he becomes president?\n\nEven though it cannot boast gold-plated accessories, Air Force One is a\nlarger aircraft, seating 70 passengers in comfort compared to Trump Force\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033301",
