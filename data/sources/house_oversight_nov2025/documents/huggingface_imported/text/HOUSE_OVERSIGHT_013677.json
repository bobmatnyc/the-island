  "text": "access...” It is perhaps strange to come to this common knowledge so late, but |\ncame to my life with my forbearers and father’s magical, mystical biases.\n\nMy father had parodied what he thought was the “wasteful time” spent in\nrational, Talmudic discussion. He said that is what Jewish men spent their time\ndoing to avoid physical work while sitting near the city gates. It was the women who\nraised the crops and cared for the cattle and children. He had a favorite conundrum\nsatirizing the village gate discussions. Jewish males, after the age of thirteen,\naccompany their morning prayer of commitment to loving and serving God with the\nritual of wrapping scripture embedded animal skin, tefillin, and winding them seven\ntimes around the left arm, near the heart, and around the head, symbolizing the\nmind. This contextualizes how my father made fun of a typical topic of these all\nmale Talmudic seminars: “If one had seven arms, would one wrap the fefillin once\naround each appendage or seven times about one of them. If the latter is the case,\nhow would one chose which one.” In fact, there remains an on-going debate about\nthe order with which the embedded four passages from Exodus and Deuteronomy\nshould be arranged and inserted in the ftefillin such that some compromising\northodox Jews wear two types of fefi/lin, each representing one of the theoretically\njustified orderings. | know now that there is an implicitly positive confirmation of a\njointly held faith and feeling of ethnic belonging achieved by such apparently\nabstract discourse and argumentation.\n\nIn truth, | had not come to Warwick to explore the relationships between faith\nand rationality using the cognitive style of mathematicism, but rather to be saved by\nthe mathematical miracles of the Brain God. Not unrelated to what C.S. Lewis saw\nas a prominent characteristic of spiritual experience, “wonder,” and what Philip\nDavis and Reuben Hersh in their 1981 book, The Mathematical Experience, spoke\nof as “beauty” and “surprise.” | know about the attack of excitement that comes with\nthe sudden emergence of counterintuitive conceptual connections while exploring\nnew mathematical ideas. In energetic high, | start skip reading, underlining the book\nfrantically, jotting commentary on the margins, copying the relevant equations into\nmy notebook. Was this the same break through to a glimmering of grace, everything\n\nbeautifully in order and precious, that | experienced on LSD while sitting for hours\n\n177\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013677",
