  "text": "Jan Loeys Global Asset Allocation\n(1-212) 834-5874 The J.P. Morgan View\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com 28 March 2013\n\nsenior bank bond holders will lose money and this risk is, in our mind, not yet\nin the price (Rethinking the capital structure, R. Henriques et al., Mar 27).\n\nForeign Exchange\n\nToday’s research note, Sacrificing Cyprus, examines several presumptions\nwhich have arisen over the past two weeks due to the Cyprus crisis, and scores\nthem on a scale of truths, half-truths and falsehoods. There are indeed some\nright conclusions to draw from this experience, but also some wrong ones. As\nexamples, it is true that capital controls have created a two-tier euro, but very\nunlikely that Cyprus is exiting EMU. And while it is true that markets deserve\narisk premium for policy uncertainty, the size of the premium should be much\nlower than in previous crises due to backstops like the OMT.\n\nFor example, during the first Greek crisis in May 2010 EUR undershot by\n10% relative to cyclical conditions at that time, and during Greek elections in\nMay 2012 the currency undershot by 5%. The combination of Italian and\nCypriot events have eliminated the euro’s overvaluation from early 2013,\nwhen the currency spiked to the high $1.30s on a presumption that LTRO\nfunds would be repaid rapidly, driving European rates higher. The currency is\nnow close to fair value, so carries no risk premium for contagion. The\nmessage is similar in vol markets: the 1% premium for 3-mo implied versus\nrealized vol is far less than the 5% premium witnessed during previous crises.\n\nWhile there is no evidence that the EUR/USD cash or options market carries a\nrisk premium, it is also true that the required premium should probably be far\nless than in previous crises given that a sovereign funding backstop like the\nOMT is in place. We are thus reluctant to extrapolate this mini-crisis into a\nsystemic event which triggers broad deleveraging, or to forecast trend euro\nweakness. The currency could trade down a couple of cents around an ECB\nrate cut, but assuming that fears around Cyprus contagion pass in a month or\ntwo, the currency should reverse its recent decline by the summertime.\n\nCommodities\n\nCommodities rallied this week, up almost 2%, led by energy. We went\ntactically long Brent in last week’s J.P. Morgan View as we believed that the\ncorrection in oil markets had brought prices too far below our price forecast of\n$112/bbl. Since then Brent is up around 1.5%. We stay long and expect\nfurther price appreciation over coming months. We are also short gasoline vs.\nBrent. Gasoline cracks (the premium for gasoline over crude prices) spiked\nover the first three months of the year due to a combination of low inventories\nand refinery closures that came during refinery maintenance season. As\nrefinery maintenance comes to a close and demand falls seasonally, gasoline\nprices should fall relative to Brent.\n\nWe went long Soybean time spreads late last year (GAZOS, Dec 5) on a view\nthat much higher Brazilian supplies would find tt difficult to leave the country\ndue to logistical constraints. Since then we have seen a record number of ships\nplanning to load soybeans in Brazilian ports and this number is still rising.\nThe average waiting time before loading is also rising, now 38 days compared\nto 26 days a month ago. This has caused the front Soybean contract to rally\nwhile longer maturity contracts have been depressed by the much higher than\nnormal supply inside the country. The spread between the May-13 and Jul-13\ncontracts has doubled since we put the trade on in December. We stay long as\nwe think these logistical issues are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.\n\nJ.P Morgan\n\nFX weekly change in USD\n\n0.8%\n0.6%\n0.4%\n0.2%\n0.0%\n0.2%\n0.4%\n0.6%\n0.8%\n\n-1.0%\nUSD JPY EUR GBP CHF CAD AUD\nTWI\n\nSource: J.P.
