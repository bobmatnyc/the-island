A Richmond, Va., bookstore owner said he called the police on Saturday after former White
House chief strategist Stephen Bannon was confronted in his store.

Nick Cooke, owner of Black Swan Books, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that a woman
called Bannon a “piece of trash.”

The woman then left the store after Cooke said he called 911.

“Steve Bannon was simply standing, looking at books, minding his own business. I asked
her to leave, and she wouldn’t. And I said, ‘I’m going to call the police if you don’t,’ and I
went to call the police and she left,” Cooke said. “And that’s the end of the story.”

Bannon grew up in Richmond, the newspaper noted.

The Richmond Police Department confirmed the call was made but the call was canceled
before officers responded.

“We are a bookshop. Bookshops are all about ideas and tolerating different opinions and not
about verbally assaulting somebody, which is what was happening,” Cooke said.
