  "text": "/ BARAK / 137\n\nremembering that, in spite of Israel’s insistence from 1948 onward that we would\nnever ask others to do our fighting for us, even as Leon and I were meeting, US\nradar operators were working around the clock to provide us with early warning\nagainst any incoming Iranian missiles. Patriot batteries were ready to deploy in\nIsrael within 72 hours of any attack. AEGIS naval vessels were within 96 hours of\nour shores, to reinforce Israel’s Arrow missile defense system with sea-launched\nweapons.\n\nPanetta made no secret of the fact he didn’t want us to launch a military strike,\neffectively killing off the many months of intensive work the Americans had\ndevoted to building international political and economic pressure on the Iranians.\nHe urged me to “think twice, three times,” before going down that road. But he\nrecognized that Israel would be affected far more dramatically by a nuclear Iran.\n“It’s your conflict. It’s your neighborhood,” he said. At one point, he asked me\noutright: “If you do decide to attack the Iranian facilities, when will we know?” I\ntold him we couldn’t give him more than a few hours’ notice. Otherwise, the\nAmericans would have to alert their bases in the Gulf, and worldwide. That might\nwell put Iran on guard before our operation was launched. But I did recognize our\nresponsibility not to leave the Americans in the dark, not only because they were a\nkey ally but because their own military and naval personnel might be at risk from\nany Iranian retaliation. “We know your command-post deployment and the\ncommunications protocols with your forces,” I told him. “We’ll make sure you\nhave enough time to tell your people,” I said. “We won’t endanger a single\nAmerican life, any of your positions or your personnel.”\n\nMy most important meeting was with the President. Though I knew him less\nwell than I did Panetta, we had met on a number of occasions. The first time was\nwhen he was still Senator Obama, on a visit to Israel during the 2008 presidential\ncampaign. As Defense Minister, I escorted him to Sderot, the town in southern\nIsrael bearing the brunt of Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza. Back in Jerusalem, we\nspent a half-hour talking in my office: about Iran. I argued that a nuclear Iran was a\nchallenge not only for Israel and the Middle East, but for America, too. I urged\nhim, if elected, to commission an early study of what the Iranians were seeking to\ndo and what could be done to stop them either by diplomatic means or, if\nnecessary, by force. Also, what the Iranians could, or more relevantly could not, do\nin response to an American or indeed an Israel attack, since our intelligence\nassessments suggested their options for retaliation would be fairly limited.
