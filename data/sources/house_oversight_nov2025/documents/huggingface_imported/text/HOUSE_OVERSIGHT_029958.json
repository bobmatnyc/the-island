It’s so funny (to me —\ntotally embarrassing to him)!!! Still like Trump and might be a delegate to the republican convention.\n\nWas in St. Thomas for a couple of days — did call this island, but never heard back. Went scuba diving off St. Jeff and it\nwas beautiful. Would be totally funny (to me at least) if you put a big fake shark or statute under the water where the\ndivers go....\n\nLove ya,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029958",
