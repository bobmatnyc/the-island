This would\nhave no effect on the events themselves as it would be like watching a\nmovie, but we could see every aspect of the past from any viewpoint.\n\nTo perform this time travel trick for real, we would have to gather\ninformation from an enormously wide area. Information spreads\nout at the speed of light. One minute after the dominoes topple, the\ninformation about the event will have spread one light minute — that\nis over a sphere forty-million kilometers across — half way to Venus.\nAn hour later and it would be outside the solar system. If you were to\ncast your net that wide, and gathered up all the information within the\nsphere, you could still perfectly model the moment when the dominoes\nwere toppled. The wider you cast the net, the more information you have\nand the further backward in time you can travel. If you take the idea of\ncollecting information to its logical conclusion you could gather all the\ninformation in the Universe at a moment in time.\n\nIn 1814, Laplace put this idea in an essay. He proposed an immensely\npowerful being observes the position and momentum of every particle\nin the Universe. Armed with any snapshot of the Universe and the laws\nof physics, the entire future and the past of the Universe. The being was\nnicknamed Laplace’s Daemon and the idea has influenced philosophy\never since.\n\nIf the Universe is predictable, our concept of time needs to be\nrethought. A common sense notion isthat things inthe futureare unknown\nand things in the past are known. But, in a deterministic Universe a\ndaemon or a supercomputer could keep track of all the information and\ntell you what is inevitably going to happen. The conscious feeling we have\nof moving through time would be just an illusion. Past and future have\nno meaning and there would just be a solid, permanent block of space-\ntime. If you stood outside the Universe and looked at this block of space-\ntime, everything that is going to happen and has already happened is set.\nThis is sometimes called the Block Universe Hypothesis and is the logical\nconclusion of any theory that imagines an entirely determined Universe.\n\nOne thing that seems to throw doubt on this Block Universe\nHypothesis is our personal conscious experience of the world. We\nexperience the Universe unfolding over time. (Of course, we could have\nthis conscious experience in a determined Universe if someone had\nprogrammed it that way. All we can say is that it seems unlikely someone\nwould go to the trouble of giving us a completely fictitious experience.\nThere are an infinite number of possible Universes, why pick one where\nwe think time flows, but it does not.)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016007",
