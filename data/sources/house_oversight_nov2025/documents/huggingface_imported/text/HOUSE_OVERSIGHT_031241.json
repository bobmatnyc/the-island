  "text": "the ‘selfie’ photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was\nrequested\nin the course of the investigation.”\n\n(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies\nnot to include flashes, so that I don’t end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour)\n\nWhat makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies,\nand when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. I am\nparticularly proud of the way I attempt to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated.\nThus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to acknowledge fans in a way that makes\nthem feel appreciated. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI\nconference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the\ninteractions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff. I have had numerous female\ngraduate students, postdocs, employees, and colleagues, and as ASU attested to you, none of these have ever\ncomplained of harassment. Quite the contrary in fact, as I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and\ntreat them with respect. I treat others as responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.\n\nLawrence M.

As we've already discussed by email, I’d very much like to interview you about these allegations in\ndetail.\n\nIn particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6\nbelow). You claimed that “both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and\nfabricated with malicious intent.” We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious\nintent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031241",
