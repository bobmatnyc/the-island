  "text": "What They Say About the Author\n\n“Paul’s own writing, in particular, seemed daring and adventurous to\nme; it took big chances and made important arguments in relentlessly funny\nways. I| felt, down deep, that maybe I had some of that in me, too; that maybe\nI could be using my skills to better express my beliefs. Zhe Realist was the\ninspiration that kept pushing me to the next level; there was no way I could\ncontinue reading it and remain the same.”\n\n--George Carlin\n\n“Paul Krassner--confidant of Lenny Bruce, co-founder of the Yippies,\ndefiler of Disney characters, publisher of The Realist, and investigative\nsatirist extraordinaire. As soon as we decided to create the Huffington Post, |\nknew I wanted him involved. His irreverence was just what the blog doctor\nordered.”\n\n--Arianna Huffington\n\n“Thanks to Paul Krassner for continuing to be the lobster claw in the\ntuna casserole of modern America.”\n--Tom Robbins\n\n“Krassner loves ironies, especially stinging ironies that nettle public\nfigures. He would rather savor a piquant irony about a public figure than eat a\nbowl of fresh strawberries and ice cream.”\n\n--Ken Kesey\n\n“T told Krassner one time that his writings made me hopeful. He found\nthis an odd compliment to offer a satirist. I explained that he made supposedly\nserious matters seem ridiculous, and that this inspired many of his readers to\ndecide for themselves what was ridiculous and what was not. Knowing that\nthere were people doing that, better late than never, made me optimistic.”\n\n--Kurt Vonnegut\n\n“Mr. Krassner is an expert at ferreting out hypocrisy and absurdism\nfrom the more solemn crannies of American culture.”\n\n--The New York Times\n\n“Krassner has the uncanny ability to alter your perceptions\npermanently.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015033",
