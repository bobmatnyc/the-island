But avoiding the worst case requires a short-term bargain plus a\nlong-term compromise on a scale not seen in Washington since the Clinton-\nCongressional budget showdown of 1995/96. As with sausage making, this\nprocess won’t be pleasant to watch. It would be easier to return in several\nweeks when the final product is ready, but for those who cannot avoid, ignore\nthe likely volatility, and add to defensive trades.\n\nWashington needs at least a month to broker deferral of a decent part of the\nfiscal cliff before it can assume the monumental task of comprehensive fiscal\nreform next year, and the currencies most vulnerable to an impasse are\nexpensive. If no grand bargain is reached before the end of the year, full\nimplementation of the cliff implies enough fiscal tightening to drive the dollar\nup 3%-5% versus commodity currencies, given typical patterns during global\ngrowth shocks. Even if these tax increases are reversed later in the year, the\nfirst response would be a higher USD versus all currencies but the yen, given\nhow long that investors are of cyclical currencies and how short they are the\nyen.\n\nStay short USD/JPY and buy USD vs high-beta (AUD, NZD, SEK and GBP)\nin cash and options for a move of a few percent in coming weeks. In options,\nsell a 1-mo NZD/USD call (0.8250 strike, 0.83 RKI), buy a bearish 2-mo\nAUD/USD seagull (buy 1.03-1.01 put spread, sell 1.05 call) and buy a bearish\n2-mo GBP/USD seagull (buy 1.57-1.55 put spread, sell 1.6250 call). Buy\nUSD/SEK in cash.\n\nCommodities\n\nCommodities are up some 1% this week, led by precious metals, which\nrallied almost 4%. The strong gains in gold are probably due to the US\nelection result as Obama’s victory means no change to Fed policy and so\ncontinued QE and negative real yields. Gold also tends to gain when there is\nhigh fiscal uncertainty, just as it did last year during the acrimonious debt\nceiling debate which cost the US its AAA rating. We stay long gold.\n\nChinese economic data came out stronger than expected this week, providing\nsupport for our view that Chinese economic growth has bottomed and will\nrebound through next year. China’s slowing activity growth has been a major\ndrag on commodities over the last few years and the improving economy is\nwhat makes us long base metals.\n\nThe expected rebound in Chinese growth does not imply that we will go back\nto the double-digit growth rates that we saw before the crisis, and immediately\nafter. The periods when China’s economy grew at a pace above 8% coincided\nwith very strong price gains on commodities, as tt boosted global demand.\nChina’s leadership is in the process of reorienting its economy towards\ndomestic consumption and to reduce reliance on exports and capital\ninvestments. As a result, Chinese growth will likely settle in a 7%-8% range\nover the medium term, a growth pace that in the past has not put upwards\npressure on commodity prices.\n\nJ.P Morgan\n\nFX weekly change in USD\n\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.0%\n0.5%\n\n-1.0%\nUSD JPY EUR GBP CHF CAD AUD\nTWI\n\nSource: J.P.
