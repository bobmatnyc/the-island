  "text": "CHAPTER 4: MILL’S IDEA\n\nMill’s Paragraph\n\nIt always seemed obvious to me that growth is free. Survival costs investment in the\nnext generation, but growth costs nothing more. It seemed to me that innovation is\nthe human specialty, that we pay its cost every day as the cost of being human, and\nthat growth happens when genius or circumstance somehow gives it traction.
