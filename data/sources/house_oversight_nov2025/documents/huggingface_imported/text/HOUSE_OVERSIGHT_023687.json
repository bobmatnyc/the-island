This year’s Two Sessions\n\nare of extraordinary importance as\nthey have adopted the constitutional\namendments, restructured govern-\nment institutions and elected the new\nnational leadership. To understand\nwhat the institutional changes mean\nfor China’s future, as well as the\npolicy agenda for the coming year,\nGlobal Times (GT) Washington-\nbased correspondent Hu Zexi talked\n‘o Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn (Kuhn)\nwho is a long-time China observer,\nand author and editor of over 25\nbooks. Kuhn has been invited to Bei-\njing to take a closer look at this year’s\nTwo Sessions.\n\nGT: What kind of policy issues are\n\nyou following during the Two Ses-\nsions?\n\nKuhn: The proposed amendments\n\nto the Constitution of the People’s\nRepublic of China give a road map\n\nof areas deemed critical. Several\n\nof the provisions strengthen the\nstability, continuity and robustness of\ngovernance. Beyond these, I looked for\nany deviations from expectations, for\nexample, on State-owned enterprise\nreform or local government financing.\nI also looked for any reaction to the\nincreased push-back against China’s\nrising global capabilities from certain\ncountries.\n\nGT: In recent years, the Chinese govern-\nment has made more efforts to make\nTwo Sessions’ agenda better meet public\nexpectations. For example, the govern-\nment will cooperate with media websites\nto conduct surveys\nabout top policy areas\nthat the public wants\nthe Two Sessions to\naddress. How do you\nevaluate such efforts?\nKuhn: Irrespective of the nature of the\npolitical system or ideology, transpar-\nency in governance is the best way for\ngovernment to deliver effective, ef-\nficient programs, and enhance credibil-\nity. The Chinese government has been\nstriving to increase transparency, which\ndeserves praise.\n\nThe Two Sessions are a vehicle for\nthe government to communicate with\nthe people and engage them through\nmedia in dealing with all the critical\nissues.\n\nGT: How do you see the political belief\nof China that democracy should meet the\nreal or fundamental needs of the public?\nKuhn: Government performance and\ndemocracy are not the same.\n\nThe former is indeed assessed by\nalleviating poverty, reducing pollution,\nimproving healthcare and the like.\nDemocracy is the public participation of\ncommon people in the complex process\nof governance.\n\nThus, true democracy is much\nbroader than one-person-one-vote.\n\nIt includes, primarily, the capacity to\nprovide substantive input on complex\n\nissues and to provide oversight in the\nmanagement of officials.\n\nGT: China for long has argued that\ndemocracy or any other political mecha-\nnism should be developed on the basis\nof a country’s specific condition. How do\nyou see this belief, as well as its practice?\nKuhn: Certainly, political systems dif-\nfer, even between countries that have\nthe same ideology. Nonetheless, there\nare great commonalities in the goals\nand objectives shared by all countries\nand people. I suspect that over time,\nmeasured in not less than decades and\nperhaps even centuries, there will be\n\na convergence of\nsystems toward\nwhat I call with a\nsmile, “Optimiza-\ntionism” — leaders,\nofficials, executives\nmaking myriad decisions every day to\noptimize outcomes without thinking of\nthe ideology.\n\nGT: There’s talk about China’s unique\nsystem of multiparty cooperation and\npolitical consultation led by the Com-\nmunist Party of China (CPC) during the\nTwo Sessions. How do you observe this\nsystem?\n\nKuhn: The benefits of a one-party-rule\nare apparent: the coherence of policies,\nrapid decision-making and formula-\ntion of strategies that require long-term\nconsistency for long-term commitment.\nBut all systems of governance have\ntrade-offs, and two challenges of one-\nparty-rule are assuring that all rational\npoints of view, including dissenting\nones, are included in the decision-mak-\ning process; and systemic checks and\nbalances for oversight of officials at all\nlevels of government.\n\nChina’s system of multi-party co-\noperation and consultation, led by the\nCPC, is a political innovation in includ-\ning inputs and ideas from diverse seg-\nments of society, while still maintaining\nharmony of spirit and consistency in\n\npolicies. But because of its scale and\npower, the CPC, which is the ruling\nparty, has a higher obligation to pay\nattention to other parties and voices. A\ntrue democracy is measured by how the\nmajority treats the minority.\n\nGT: As a decades-long observer of China,\nwhat do you think the constitutional\namendment will bring to the country?\nKuhn: This constitutional amendment\nis all about strengthening China’s\nsystem of governance, especially the\nParty’s leadership of the country and\nPresident Xi Jinping’s leadership of the\nParty and the nation.\n\nGoing by the whiplash of Western\nreactions, one could be forgiven for as-\nsuming that the amendment is all about\nabolishing term limits of the president\nand vice president. In fact, there are 21\nclauses in the constitutional amend-\nment and to understand where China\nis going, one must gauge the meaning\nand intent of all of them.\n\nXi has been consistent in respect-\ning, indeed in championing, China’s\nConstitution, and by now amending it,\nhe underscores the congruity between\nthe realities of how China is governed\nand what the Constitution says — thus\nbolstering Xi’s commitment to the Rule\nof Law.\n\nEstablishing the National Supervi-\nsory Law and Commissions, expanding\nthe anti-corruption campaign to all\npublic organs and organizations, reaf-\nfirms Xi’s commitment to enhancing\nthe rule of law.\n\nAs for term limits, it is not that Xi\nwill hold the formal titles of leader-\nship for life, but that he will hold real\neadership long enough to bring about\nChina’s national rejuvenation and es-\nablish Chinese type democratic norms.\n\nAll factors considered, because of\nChina’s special conditions and Xi’s spe-\ncial capabilities, abolishing term limits\nmay be good for China. It is commonly\nsaid that China’s system of governance\ncan ensure stability and consistency,\n\nwhich is a necessary requirement\nfor advancing reform.\n\nGT: What do you see as the under-\nlying reason for the institutional\nrestructuring of the government\npassed during the Two Sessions?\nKuhn: The sweeping restructur-\ning of the Chinese government\nstreamlines the bureaucracy,\neliminates institutional conflicts\nof interest between government\nbodies, aligns authority with\nresponsibility, and, significantly,\nenhances the leadership of the\nParty in the management as well\nas the oversight of the govern-\nment. Although the restructur-\ning has multiple motivations, a\nprime driver is to support China’s\ncontinuing development under\ncomplex conditions — a slowing\neconomy, uncertain financial risk,\nunacceptable pollution, the special\ndemands of innovation.\n\nGiven China’s challenges at\nhome and abroad the government\nrestructure is timely. Some media\noutlets describe it as a “reshuffle,”\nas if the random rearrangement of\n\na deck of cards. I beg to differ.\n\nThis restructuring is as deliberate as\nit is far-reaching — and planned precise-\nly to address a host of contradictions.\nThe outcome is to strengthen CPC’s\nleadership throughout the country. In\nfact, deepening reform is now defined,\nfor state as well as for Party institutions,\nas strengthening the CPC’s leadership\nin every sector. The aim is consistency\nand uniformity in implementing policy.\n\nThe announcement of the restruc-\nturing followed swiftly after the adop-\ntion by the National People’s Congress\nof the constitutional amendment, and\nalthough both were long in the works,\ntheir rapid-fire sequence serves to un-\nderscore the preeminence of President\nXi in setting the new agenda, and the\npower of the Party in implementing the\nnew policies.\n\nGT: Environment has always been a\nheated topic at the Two Sessions. How\ndo you see the prospect of green develop-\nment in China?\nKuhn: | have been following China’s\nenvironmental problems for over two\ndecades, and until recent years under\nPresident Xi. While officials would of\ncourse decry pollution, it only became\nprogressively worse. Companies flouted\nthe law. The minuscule fines were a\nsmall price for not worrying about the\ncost of controlling pollution. Officials\nwere loath to risk impeding economic\ngrowth. Today is dramatically different.\nPresident Xi has raised ecology and\nenvironment to the highest category of\nnational priorities. Ecological progress\nis among the five top goals (along with\neconomic, political, cultural and social\nprogress). Green is the third of the New\n(Five Major) Concepts of Development.\nThe change in attitudes toward pollu-\ntion is stunning. For example, fines for\ncorporate pollution now hurt.\n\nPage Editor:\nyujincui@globaltimes.com.cn\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023687",
