  "text": "My favorite response came from Merriman Smith, the syndicated\nUPI correspondent who always ended White House press conferences with\nthe traditional “Thank you, Mr. President.” He wrote:\n\n“One of the filthiest printed attacks ever made on a President of\nthe United States is now for sale on Washington newsstands. The target:\nPresident Johnson. This is the May edition of a so-called magazine which\nsays it is entered as second class mail. One newsstand owner says sales of\nthis particular issue have been = ‘quite active.’ This reporter is not\nembarked here on any defense of Johnson politically or personally, nor, for\nthat matter, is this to suggest the need for greater respect for the\npresidency.\n\n“These are matters that have been dealt with extensively in other\nforums. Certain unadorned facts, however, do stand out in the open\ncirculation, mailing and other forms of distribution of this sort of slime: Ifa\nmagazine of major national standing tries to use the same sort of\nlanguage, federal action to stop it would be almost certain. The language\nreferred to is not conventional hell or damn profanity—-it is filth attributed\nto someone of national stature supposedly describing something Johnson\n\nallegedly did. The incident, of course, never took place. . .”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015088",
