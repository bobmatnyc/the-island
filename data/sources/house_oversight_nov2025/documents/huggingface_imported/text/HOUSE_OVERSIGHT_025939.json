  "text": "Case 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 1 of 2 \nDECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER \nI, Jane Doe, the Plaintiff in this matter proceeding under a pseudonym, state as follows: \n1. I am a competent adult over 18 years of age able to testify as to personal knowledge. The facts \nin this declaration are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and I am \ncompetent to testify to them if called upon to do so. \n2. I was subject to extreme sexual and physical abuse by the Defendants, including forcible rape, \nthat took place at several parties of Defendant Epstein during the summer of 1994 in New York City at a \nresidence used by Defendant Epstein. During this period, I was 13 years old. \n3. More particularly, I traveled by bus to New York City in June 1994 in the hope of starting a \nmodeling career. I went to several modeling agencies but was told that I needed to put together a \nmodeling portfolio before I would be considered. I then went to the Port Authority in New York City to \nstart to make my way back home. There I met a woman who introduced herself to me as She \ntold me about the parties and said that, if I would join her at the parties, I would be introduced to \npeople who could get me into the modeling profession, also told me I would be paid for \nattending. \n4. The parties were held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey \nEpstein. Each of the parties had other minor females and a number of guests of Mr. Epstein, including \nDefendant Donald Trump at four of the parties I attended. I understood that both Mr. Trump and Mr. \nEpstein knew that I was 13 years old. \n5. Defendant Trump had sexual contact with me at four different parties in the summer of 1994. \nOn the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied me to a bed, \nexposed himself to me, and then proceeded to forcibly rape me. During the course of this savage sexual \nattack, I loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but he did not. Defendant Trump responded to \nmy pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do \nwhatever he wanted. \n6. Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal \nany of the details of Defendant Trump's sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be \nphysically harmed if not killed. \n7. Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with me at two of the parties that summer. On the \nsecond occasion involving Defendant Epstein, Defendant Epstein forced himself upon me and proceeded \nto rape me anally and vaginally despite my loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to \nstrike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant \nEpstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump, before I finally \nmanaged to break away from Defendant Epstein. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025939 \nCase 1:16-cv-04642 Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 2 of 2 \n8. Immediately following this rape, just like Defendant Trump, Defendant Epstein threatened me \nnot to ever reveal any of the details of Defendant Epstein's sexual and physical abuse of me or else my \nfamily and I would be physically harmed if not killed. \n9. Both Defendants had let me know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated \nthat they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, Defendant Trump stated \nthat I shouldn't ever say anything if I didn't want to disappepr like , a 12-year-old female that was \nforced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third \nincident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed. \n10. The duress imposed on me by Defendants not to ever reveal any of the details of the sexual and \nphysical abuse caused to me by Defendants has not terminated and the fear it has instilled in me has not \nsubsided. Unfortunately, making matters worse for me, I was subjected to daily painful reminders of \nthe horrific acts of Defendant Trump via mass media coverage of him starting last summer that, over a \nshort period of time, became continuous and unavoidable. \n11. The duress had prevented me from starting litigation before this year. However, as soon as I \nsurfaced, I received threats. More specifically, shortly after my first complaint was filed in California on \nApril 26, 2016, I started receiving threatening phone calls on a cell phone I then owned. The calls were \nnever for more than 20 seconds or so before they hung up and they were always from a blocked or \nunavailable phone number according to my caller ID feature. Since I changed phone numbers, the \nthreatening calls have completely stopped. \n12. This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and I believe \nthat identification of me would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to me and to others. \n13. I have no reason to believe that the Defendants' threats have ever been lifted or will ever be \nlifted and so I request that the Court issue an order protecting me and my family from harm and \nharassment by the Defendants. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nDATED: June 18, 2016 \nne Doe, a pseudonym \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025940",
