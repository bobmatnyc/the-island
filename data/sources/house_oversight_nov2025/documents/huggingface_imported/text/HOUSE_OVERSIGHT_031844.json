But the symbolism of Mitchell\nleaving several days before Obama's biggest week of outreach to the\nregion projected a vacuum of confidence that anything hopeful,\nhowever remote, was on the horizon.\n\n\"He wouldn't be leaving at this important hour if he knew there was\ngoing to be a significant change in the administration's attitude\ntoward the peace process,\" said Middle East analyst Gregory Orfalea,\nwho formerly taught at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.\n\"He's leaving because it's status quo.\"\n\nMitchell will be replaced—in the interim by his deputy, David Hale—\nand another official will take a crack at the quandary. But despite new\nmomentum from Netanyahu's visit next week and Obama's speech\nThursday, Mitchell's departure could signal stagnant talks for the next\nseveral years. According to Fawaz Gerges, director of the London\nSchool of Economics' Middle East Center, \"the reality is that, with\nMitchell leaving, Barack Obama basically lost the ideological battle\n[over how to confront the peace process]. By now he'll have to wait\nfor the second term before you can get another concerted effort.\"\n\nDaniel Stone is Newsweek's White House correspondent. He also\ncovers national energy and environmental policy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031844",
