  "text": "26\n\nfrom assisting Hamas, the president’s constitutional powers to\nconduct foreign affairs might exempt officials carrying out the\ngovernment’s international policy from criminal prosecution. The\nexisting laws and regulations, however, make federal officials just as\nliable for providing aid to FTOs as any private citizen, and any\ncontrary argument would rest, at best, on untested grounds.\nAdditionally, it could be argued that because Hamas does not control\nthe PA outright, aid to the PA is not the same as aid to Hamas. This\nmay seem persuasive in some circumstances; for instance, if Hamas\nheld only a small minority of the PA’s parliamentary seats. But that is\nhardly the case with regard to the current reconciliation agreement,\nwhich places equal power in the hands of Fatah and Hamas to form\nan interim government and appoint various ministers through\nconsensus. Moreover, according to OFAC’s regulations, Hamas\nneeds only an interest in PA transactions, rather than full control of\nthe PA itself, to trigger sanctions against funding the PA. In fact,\nfollowing Hamas’ election success in 2006, OFAC determined that\nHamas had “a property interest” in PA business; this may have some\nbearing on funding the new unity government. Much like the OFAC\nregulations, the U.S. criminal code does not clearly specify when an\nFTO’s interest in an organization becomes so great that it is unlawful\nto provide that organization with “material support.” Moreover, the\nserious penalties associated with violating these criminal laws\ndemand caution when considering whether to aid an organization in\nwhich an FTO such as Hamas plays a significant role.\n\nAnother possible method for the United States to continue funding\nthe PA is an exception in the criminal code for persons who provide\n“personnel,” “training,” or “expert advice or assistance” to an FTO\nwith approval of the secretary of state and the attorney general. This\nexception could allow the United States to advise PA security and\npolice forces, but it would not permit direct financial aid. Similarly,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030181",
