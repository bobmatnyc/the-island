In turn,\n\nhigher UK interest rates would make sterling-\ndenominated assets more appealing to foreign\ninvestors and support the currency.\n\nFinally, while sterling certainly has scope to\ndepreciate, market participants are already well-\npositioned for further weakness. Those positions\nmay become vulnerable if the UK’s negotiations\nwith its trade partners turn more amicable and the\ndomestic UK economy remains resilient.\n\nWith these upside risks being tempered by the\nunknowable evolution of Brexit negotiations for\nnow, we see balanced risks for the pound this year\nand thus remain tactically neutral.\n\nEmerging Market Currencies\n\nEmerging market currencies caught a welcome\nupdraft last year, following a 45% freefall since\nmid-2011. The flight was not without turbulence,\nhowever. Following a 12% rally in the first half of\nthe year—reflecting a dovish shift in US monetary\npolicy and waning fears about Chinese capital\noutflows—emerging market currencies hit an air\npocket that erased much of these gains following\nthe surprise outcome of the US elections.\n\nWe believe this downdraft is likely to persist.\nThe prospect of higher US interest rates, a stronger\ndollar and China’s bumpy deceleration spells\ntighter global financial conditions and a risk\n\nof capital outflows from emerging markets—\nconditions that have historically constituted a stiff\nheadwind to their currencies.\n\nThese risks are magnified by the uncertainty\nsurrounding the incoming US administration’s\ntrade policies. Fears of protectionism have already\nnegatively impacted the currencies of China and\nMexico—the two largest sources of manufacturing\nexports to the US—with the peso and Chinese\nrenminbi down 11.6% and 2.3%, respectively,\nsince the election.\n\nEven so, we do not think a broad tactical short\nin emerging market currencies is appealing at this\nstage. Despite the small rally last year, emerging\nmarket currencies remain attractively valued (see\nExhibit 76), particularly given their enticing 5%\nyield differential to the US dollar. Moreover, the\nnew US administration may prove to be more\nmeasured in its actions than its rhetoric—a non-\nnegligible risk that could revive sentiment and\nimprove prospects for emerging market currencies.\nThe Mexican peso, in particular, could benefit in\nthat event.\n\nFor now, we remain tactically positioned to\nbenefit from further renminbi weakness given our\nlong-standing concerns about China’s economic\nvulnerabilities and the likelihood of looser policy,\npolicy mistakes and capital outflows. The potential\nfor US trade protectionism directed at China,\nthough not our base case, would further benefit\nthis position.\n\n2017 Global Fixed Income Outlook\n\nLast year witnessed a notable reversal of fortune\nfor global interest rates. Despite reaching all-time\nclosing lows shortly after the surprise Brexit vote,\n10-year yields in developed markets had reclaimed\nmuch—if not all—of those declines by year-end.\nIn the US, a more than one percentage point swing\nwas sufficient to turn the 10-year bond’s 9% gain\ninto a loss.\n\nWhile some have portrayed this reversal as\njust another setback in the now three-decade-old\nbond bull market, we are more skeptical. The\npolicy mix that has depressed interest rates in\nthe post-crisis period—a combination of fiscal\nausterity, negative or near-zero central bank policy\nrates and large-scale asset purchases—is losing\nfavor, as even policymakers acknowledge the often\ncounterproductive impact of these policies.
