  "text": "For employment gains, USA Inc. should minimize tax and regulatory uncertainties and\nencourage businesses to add workers. While hiring and R&D-related tax credits may add to\nnear-term deficits, over time, they should drive job and GDP growth. Immigration reform could\nalso help: A Federal Reserve study in 2010 shows that immigration does not take jobs from\nU.S.-born workers but boosts productivity and income per worker.\n\nChanging tax policies.\n\nUsing another simple mechanical illustration, covering the 2010 budget deficit (excluding one-\ntime charges) by taxes alone would mean doubling individual income tax rates across the board,\nto roughly 26-30% of gross income, we estimate. Such major tax increases would ultimately be\nself-defeating if they reduce private income and consumption. However, reducing tax\nexpenditures and subsidies such as mortgage interest deductions would broaden the tax base\nand net up to $1.7 trillion in additional revenue over the next decade, per CBO. A tax based on\nconsumption - like a value added tax (VAT) - could also redirect the economy toward savings\nand investment, though there would be drawbacks.\n\nThese issues are undoubtedly complex, and difficult decisions must be made. But\ninaction may be the greatest risk of all. The time to act is now, and our first responsibility\nas investors in USA Inc. is to understand the task at hand.\n\nOur review finds serious challenges in USA Inc.’s financials. The ‘management team’ has\ncreated incentives to spend on healthcare, housing, and current consumption. At the margin,\ninvesting in productive capital, education, and technology — the very tools needed to compete in\nthe global marketplace — has stagnated.\n\nAmerica’s Resources Allocated to Housing + Healthcare Nearly Doubled as a Percent\n\nof GDP Since 1965, While Household and Government Savings Fell Dramatically\n\nHealthcare + Housing Spending vs. Net Household +\nGovernment Savings as % of GDP, 1965-2009\n\n— Housing + Healthcare Spending as % of GDP\n\n—oO=Net Household + Government Savings as % of GDP\n\nAs % of GDP\n\n1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995\n\nNote: Housing includes purchase, rent and home improvement.
