That’s a problem. The Muslim\nBrotherhood will loom large in a free Egypt because it has an\norganizational head start. That may be a problem. Turkey’s ruling\nJustice and Development Party is a brilliant political machine with a\nruthless bent. That’s a problem, too.\n\nThese are problems of different sizes.
