I had hoped to move forward with my science philanthropy and helping\nthose less privileged than myself. Then came Scott Rothstein.\n\nScott Rothstein was the senior partner of RRA. He is currently serving a 50 -year\nprison sentence for perpetrating the largest fraud in South Florida’s history. He\ndecided that sex allegations made against me could be used to fleece hundreds of\ninvestors out of hundreds of millions of dollars. He recruited Brad Edwards, a\nsmalltime Ft. Lauderdale attorney who had access to some of the women on the\ngovernment list. eo stetr forged Judges signatures, bate behind attorney client\nprivilege, secrecty of legal docu, work product, cover letter; giving illegal\ninvestigative activity the protection normally reserved for lawyers and their\nlegitimate clients. He falsely told investors that I had settled cases with him for\nhundreds of millions of dollars, but the women wanted their money right away. If\nthey gave him 30 million dollars now, he could give part of it to the women who\nwanted to remain anonymous, they would go off into the sunset with their money,\nand the full payment would be made to the investors. Investors that would be\ngetting 50- 100% return on their money for taking advantage of the same women\nwho allegedly had come in contact with me. Bill Schere, an attorney in Broward, has\nfiled 147 complaints against Scott Rothstein and the firm.\n\nThe attorney for the women, aware that I would be loathe in involve innocent\nfriends in problems that were strictly of my own making, subpoenaed names and\ntried to smear any friend or mine whose name appeared in print previously. They\ncontacted Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, David Copperfield; innocent bystanders with\nno knowledge of any of my actions whatsoever. | settled the cases rather than\nforcing both the women and others to be subject to a public questioning of their\nlives.\n\nIt appears that the Rothstein firm had continuing help from the government\nthroughout their civil litigations. Emails re as aresult of a recent subpoena\nshow descriptions such as, “received info from current FBI agents”.\n\nThe former Rothstein partners subpoenaed my attorney for all correspondence\nregarding my plea with the US attorney. Though highly unusual, the government\nsided with the former Rothstein partners and agreed we needed to produce all the\ncorrespondence between the government and my attorneys.\n\nDuring the civil deposition of my former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, attended by\na new attorney from the Rothstein firm, whose name appears on the record as CARA\nHolmes, [also appears as Carolyn Holmes, also appears as Kara Holmes], the\nhouseman allegedly said that he had stolen a book from my house with telephone\nnumbers in it that the government wanted. This was in July of 2009. I believe that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025543",
