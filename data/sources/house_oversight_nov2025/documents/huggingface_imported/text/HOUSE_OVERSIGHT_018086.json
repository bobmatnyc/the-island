But, six\nmonths on, progress has been patchy.\n\nMohammed Bouazizi, the young Tunisian who started it all by\nburning himself to death in December 2010, had his desperate\nimitators in Egypt, where revolution erupted days after Zine el-\nAbidine Ben Ali's flight into Saudi exile; and in Jordan, which has\nseen sporadic unrest but no uprising.\n\nBut if the politics of the Arab spring are local, many factors are\ncommon across: young people angry and frustrated at the lack of\nfreedoms, opportunities and jobs, unaccountable and corrupt\ngovernments, cronyism and, in a few places, grinding poverty.\n\nRich and poor alike lived in fear of the secret police. But Tunisia, one\nof the most repressive regimes, fell quickly. The decision by the army\nto dump the president and not crush the protests was a vital lesson for\nthe Egyptian generals. The alternative is the cruelty of the dictators'\nfightbacks in Tripoli and Damascus. Regional differences were\nignored in the chain reaction that followed. Yemen's protests were\ngalvanised by the drama in Cairo's Tahrir Square but they also\ninvolved tribalism, elite rivalry and a small but alarming al-Qaida\npresence against a background of resource depletion and fear of state\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018086",
