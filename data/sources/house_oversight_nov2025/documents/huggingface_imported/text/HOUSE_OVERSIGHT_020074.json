  "text": "And yet, contravening all cultural and media logic, Donald Trump produced on a daily\nbasis an astonishing, can’t-stop-following-it narrative. And this was not even because he\nwas changing or upsetting the fundamentals of American life. In six months as president,\nfailing to master almost any aspect of the bureaucratic process, he had, beyond placing his\nnominee on the Supreme Court, accomplished, practically speaking, nothing. And yet,\nOMG!!! There almost was no other story in America—and in much of the world. That was\nthe radical and transformational nature of the Trump presidency: it held everybody’s\nattention.\n\nInside the White House, the daily brouhaha and world’s fascination was no cause for\njoy. It was, in the White House staff’s bitter view, the media that turned every day into a\nclimactic, dastardly moment. And, in a sense, this was correct: every development cannot\nbe climactic. The fact that yesterday’s climax would soon, compared to the next climax, be\npiddling, rather bore out the disproportion. The media was failing to judge the relative\nimportance of Trump events: most Trump events came to naught (arguably all of them\ndid), and yet all were greeted with equal shock and horror. The White House staff believed\nthat the media’s Trump coverage lacked “context’”—by this, they meant that people ought\nto realize that Trump was mostly just huffing and puffing.\n\nAt the same time, few in the White House did not assign blame to Trump for this as\nwell. He seemed to lack the most basic understanding that a president’s words and actions\nwould, necessarily, be magnified to the nth power. In some convenient sense, he failed to\nunderstand this because he wanted the attention, no matter how often it disappointed him.\nBut he also wanted it because again and again the response surprised him—and, as though\nevery time was the first time, he could not modify his behavior.\n\nSean Spicer caught the brunt of the daily drama, turning this otherwise reasonable,\nmild-mannered, process-oriented professional into a joke figure standing at the White\nHouse door. In his daily out-of-body experience, as a witness to his own humiliation and\nloss for words, Spicer understood after a while—although he began to understand this\nbeginning his first day on the job when dealing with the dispute about the inaugural\naudience numbers—that he had “gone down a rabbit hole.” In this disorienting place, all\npublic artifice, pretense, proportion, savvy, and self-awareness had been cast off, or—\npossibly another result of Trump never really intending to be president—never really\nfigured into the state of being president.\n\nOn the other hand, constant hysteria did have one unintended political virtue. If every\nnew event canceled out every other event, like some wacky news-cycle pyramid scheme,\nthen you always survived another day.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nDonald Trump’s sons, Don Jr., thirty-nine, and Eric, thirty-three, existed in an enforced\ninfantile relationship to their father, a role that embarrassed them, but one that they also\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020074",
