SCAROLA: -- that doesn't preclude\nsomeone from sharing that call-in number. And\nit is appropriate that anybody on the line\nidentify themselves.\nAnd if the people on the line refuse to\nidentify themselves, then it's our intention to\ncut off the line, and the people who are\nauthorized to be on the line can call back in.\nMR.

Right.\nQ.  -- so not those people --\nA. Right.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n315\n\nQ.  -- have you told anyone that Professor\nDershowitz abused Virginia Roberts or any other minor?\n\nA. No. I've -- what I have tried to say is that\nI'm representing a young woman who has made those\nallegations. As an attorney, I'm proud to represent\nher, proud to present her case in court, proud to\npresent arguments to whoever will listen that she's been\nsexually abused by various people.\n\nQ. Okay. And you have spoken with\nrepresentatives of the News Media on the record and off\nthe record about this case; isn't that -- is that not\ncorrect?\n\nA. Well, on the record, yes; with regard to off\nthe record, there have been some communications that I\nthink now have been turned over to the -- to the\ndefense. So I don't -- I'm not sure if there still\nremain any off the record -- I suppose probably there\nare a few, but I would -- I think most of the -- what\nwere originally off-the-record communications have now\nbeen provided to -- to the defense time.\n\nQ. Mr. Cassell, is it not true -- true, that you\nhave spoken with reporters on what you referred to as\nquote, background, close quote?\n\nA. Yeah. I mean that's different than -- your\n‘earlier question was off the record and on the record.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n\n(954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010881",
