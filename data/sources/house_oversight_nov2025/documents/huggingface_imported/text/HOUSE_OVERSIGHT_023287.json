And yet,\nJT Rogers’s new\n\nplay Oslo, about\n\nthe astonishing,\nbehind-the-scenes negotiations that\nresulted in the historic Oslo Accords\nin 1993, won a Tony for Best Play on\nBroadway this year, and has already\nvirtually sold out its month-long run\nat the National. Such is the demand\nthat the production, starring Toby\nStephens, promptly transfers to the\nWest End in October.\n\nOslo dramatises a period of history\n-anda brief spell of optimism - that\nis now a distant memory. With so\nmuch of the modern-day Middle East\nconsumed by turmoil and conflict, it’s\nal-Qaeda, so-called Islamic State, Iraq,\nSyria and Libya that are dominating\nthe headlines, not the peace process.\n\nEven as we approach the\n100th anniversary of the Balfour\nDeclaration, whereby Britain\ncommnitted itself to the establishment\nof a Jewish homeland in the\nuncultivated area of the eastern\nMediterranean known as Palestine,\nthe long-running conflict between\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians is no\nlonger the main story. So much so\nthat theatregoers in New York were\nheard to remark after a performance\nof Oslo, “Oh, the PLO! I’d forgotten all\nabout them.”\n\nYet by taking the art of diplomacy\n\nReproduced by Gorkana under licence from the NLA (newspapers), CLA (magazines), FT (Financial Times/ft.com) or other copyright owner.

Their efforts were rewarded\nwith a momentous ceremony on the\nWhite House lawn in September\n1993, with Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli\nprime minister, and Yasser Arafat,\nthe PLO chairman, shaking hands\n\nto seal the deal in front of a beaming\npresident Bill Clinton. And sitting\nanonymously among the thousands\nof global dignitaries who had flocked\nto Washington to witness this historic\nevent was Terje Red-Larsen, the\ncultivated, softly spoken Norwegian\ndiplomat who, with his wife Mona\nJuul, made it all possible by enabling\nthe rival delegations to meet in secret\nto thrash out their differences.\n\nAs a journalist covering these\nextraordinary events for The Daily\nTelegraph during the Nineties, I came\nto know a number of these players\npersonally. Many of them are no\nlonger around to reflect on Rogers’s\nversion of events. Rabin, the great\nIsraeli warrior-turned-politician who\nagreed to make peace with Arafat,\naman most Israelis, as one Israeli\n\ncharacter in the play remarks, saw as\nbeing akin to “Hitler in his bunker”,\nwas murdered by a Jewish extremist\nin November 1995 in revenge for\nsigning the deal.
