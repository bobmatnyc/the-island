  "text": "Real estate is perceived as attractive based\non supply of investment opportunities\nIn last year’s report, we monitored sovereign\ninvestment in real estate, with its perceived superior\nsupply-side dynamics relative to other real asset and\nalternative categories. While asset allocation shifts\nhave slowed this year, the trend towards real estate\nhas accelerated, driven by capacity for sovereign\ninvestment. For example, it is noted that while\nrelatively few countries offer private investors access\nto a wide range of investment-grade infrastructure\ninvestments, there is broad access to commercial and\noffice sectors across major developed and emerging\nmarkets, causing sovereigns to cite real estate as\nthe asset class with the fewest execution challenges\n(figure 14).\n\nFurthermore, investment sovereigns with large\ninternal teams noted that real estate was unique\nin its scope for greenfield investment. Sovereigns\ncontinue to develop internal asset management\ncapability in real estate (figure 15 highlights the\nhigh levels on internal management within real\nestate), enabling them to generate investment\nopportunities themselves, rather than source and\ncompete for real estate deals with other investors.\nIn an environment where challenges executing\nagainst target real asset and alternative allocations\ndrag on investment returns, supply depth is a key\ndifferentiator for real estate.\n\n24\n\nTarget illiquid\nalternative\nallocations have\nincreased, despite\ndeployment\nchallenges.\n\nmM 2016\nM2017\n\nFig 14.
