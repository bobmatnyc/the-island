  "text": "elephant in his living room—that is, the e/ephant in the\nroom. (Epstein says too it’s a reminder that elephants\nhave 23 copies of tumor suppressor genes and humans\nhave only 1.) The single book on his bedside table is\nLolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).\n\nAnd, too, he seems often to be right. Since I began\nworking on this piece in September, Epstein predictions\nabout the price of oil, yen, ruble, and euro have all born\nout. If I had invested $100,000 the way Epstein said I\nshould in early September, by the end of January I\nwould have made $2.4 million. (Alas, I did not invest.)\n\nAt any one moment, he is making a series of bets\nfor himself and others--very much not as a workaday\nhedge fund, and much more as a privileged association.\nMoney is always about the club it gets you into.\n\nMost everyone who is now of a certain age and\nambition and status grew up in, and found they were\ntemperamentally suited to, the era of wealth that started\nin the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as\nVanity Fair would baldly dub it, the new establishment,\nan increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at\nfurther and further remove from the ordinary one.\nEpstein’s is just one version.\n\nEpstein often tells, with some obvious marvel, his\nmiddle class to riches tale: born in 1953 in Coney\nIsland, father worked for the city’s Parks Department,\nmother a housewife.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022877",
