Dr. Spencer was the cheerful\npersonification of an old-fashioned physician. He wore a red beret and\nused folksy expressions like “by golly.”. He had been performing\nabortions for 40 years. He started out charging $5, and never more than\n$100. He rarely used the word pregnant. Rather, he would say, “She was\nthat way, and she came to me for help.”\n\nAshland was a small town, and Dr. Spencer's work was not merely\ntolerated; the community depended on it--the hotel, the restaurant, the\ndress shop—-all thrived on the extra business that came from his out-of-\ntown patients. However, he built facilities at his clinic for African-American\npatients who weren't allowed to obtain overnight lodgings elsewhere. The\nwalls of his office were decorated with those little wooden signs that\ntourists like to buy. A sign on the ceiling over his operating table said Keep\nCalm.\n\nHere’ san excerpt from our dialogue:\n\nQ.
