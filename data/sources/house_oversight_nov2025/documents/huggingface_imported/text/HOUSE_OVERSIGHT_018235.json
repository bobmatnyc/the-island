  "text": "Preface\n\nThree hundred years ago the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution began\ntheir pounding work on the foundations of an ancient order. Like twin hammers,\nthese forces demolished most of what once seemed permanent: Kings, alchemists,\npopes, feudal lords - they were all undone.\n\nToday, a fresh hammer is cracking away at our world. The demands of constant,\ninstant connection are tearing at old power arrangements. The formation of\nnetworks of all kinds, for trade and biology and finance and warfare and any ofa\nthousand varied needs, is producing new and still dimly understood sources of\npower. They are eroding the roots of an older order even as a new one is beginning\nto appear. In fact, this process is only beginning. The networks ahead of us will be\neven faster than those we have today. They will also be informed by artificial\nintelligence. The combination of these two forces - instantness and thinking\nmachines - will further deepen an already profound change.\n\nThat last great shift of the Enlightenment was a violent and wonderful\ntransformation. It produced winners and losers, triggered tragedy and lit fresh\ntriumphs. What lies ahead of us is the same. A new landscape of power is emerging\nnow. This book is its story, and the tale of the instinct that will divide those who\nmaster it from those who will be mastered by it.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018235",
