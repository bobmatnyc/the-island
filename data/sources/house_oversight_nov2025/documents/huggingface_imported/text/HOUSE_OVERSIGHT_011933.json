According to a complaint filed in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, [assistant\nand girlfriend Ghislaine] Maxwell, Brunel, [house manager Alfredo] Rodriguez, and Marcinkova\n‘deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through\nMC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.\n\nThe previous paragraph in the story read:\n\nand making [speaking of Jeffrey Epstein] frequent $100,000 donations to the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment would insulate him from prosecution for his various depravities.\n\nWhich included, for the record: buying a 14-year-old Yugloslavian named Natalia Marcinkova\nfrom her parents in order to keep Marcinkova as his \"sex slave\": paying a retinue of women to\ntrawl Palm Beach for teenagers economically desperate enough to agree to give Epstein\n\n\"massages\" that often led to sexual contact; receiving two 12-year-old French girls as a \"birthday\npresent\"; and befriending Michael Wolff.\n\noe\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011933",
