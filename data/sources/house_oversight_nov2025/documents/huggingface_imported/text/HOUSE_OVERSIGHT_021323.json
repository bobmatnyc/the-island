  "text": "experiments have suggested that\nunderstanding actions and objects invoke\nsome of the same brain structures used\nto perform the actions and to act on the\nobjects. With respect to actions in\nparticular, humans sometimes use their\nown motor repertoire in interpreting\nactions, possibly by imagining or\nmentally simulating the perceived\naction. When people are asked to\nobserve the actions of others,\nparticularly goal-directed actions\ninvolving the hands or mouth, they seem\nto activate brain regions for moving the\nhands or mouth. Thus, there is a link\nbetween observing actions and executing\nactions. This has a relevance to\neducation as well: “Understanding by\ndoing” (1.e., by observing and then\nexecuting) has a long and valued\ntradition in American education’, and\nthese recent scientific results might help\nus understand why this is effective.\n\nWhen my son was 5 years old, he\nwas a member of a kids’ soccer team in\nHyde Park, on the campus of the\nUniversity of Chicago. His coach was a\nprofessor of history at the university, a\nwoman who had never played soccer,\nbut was a voracious reader, and in her\nreadings on the subject, took careful note\nof all the methods needed to play soccer\nas well as the rules and regulations. She\nmethodically took the kids through all\nthe (theoretically relevant motor) steps\nneeded to dribble the ball, to pass, and to\nshoot — flex your foot this way, bend\nyour leg that way, keep your arms this\nway, etc. The kids tried to follow the\nverbal instructions but their motor\nperformance was less than stellar — they\nlearned a little bit, but they lost all of\ntheir dozen games, for a depressing 0-12\nrecord. The next season, the same team\nwas coached by another volunteer\nparent, this time an engineer from\n\nPage |77\n\nTrinidad, who had played soccer his\nwhole life. The instructions he gave the\nkids were quite different: “Follow me\nand do what I do”. There were no\nsuggested foot flexions or extensions,\nand no specific leg movements\nproposed. The kids learned the skills,\nand won all their games. Why? The kids\nlearned by observing a good model and\nthen imitating what they observed the\nperson doing, which appears to be a way\nto learn motor skills that is far stronger\nthan that of explicit motor instruction.\n\nWhen people have strokes, a part\nof their brain dies, and they can lose the\nability to speak or use a hand properly.\nWe are now using this idea of imitation\nin a treatment program to re-educate\npeople with strokes to use their hands\nbetter and to pronounce words better.\nFor these imitation-based treatments,\npeople first observe a particular hand\naction or speech sample on a video\nmonitor, and then they try to produce it.\nIn fact, they observe it over and over\nagain for a while before they even try to\ndo it at all. They are never told how to\nmove their hands or mouths; they are\njust told to copy what they see. Over the\ncourse of six weeks, people with hand\nproblems progress from imitating a\nsimple grasp of a cup to picking up a\ntelephone and dialing a number to\npicking up a toothbrush, brushing their\nteeth, and returning the brush to the sink.\nThose with speech problems progress\nfrom imitating simple words of a single\nsyllable to longer less common words\nand even short phrases. We have already\nshown that these therapies have\nbeneficial effects in a number of people\nand are now trying it out more\nextensively.\n\nThere seems to be an important\nlink between observing and executing\nactions. Similarly, there is a link\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021323",
