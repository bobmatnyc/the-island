So | said, “I’m too young. | want to get my massage\n\nmF\n\ncredentials, then maybe we'll do it’.\n\nThe tycoon took her at her word and, for her 19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to Thailand where he\nenrolled her in a massage course.\n\nShortly after arriving there, she met an Australian martial arts expert called Robert. They fell in love and,\njust ten days later, married in a Buddhist ceremony.\n\n‘| called Jeffrey and told him I'd fallen madly in love,’ Virginia says. ‘I was hoping he’d be delighted. But\nhe said, “Have a nice life,” and hung up on me.’ The couple now have two sons, aged five and four, and a\ndaughter who recently turned one.\n\n‘The first few months after | married Robert were the worst,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t bring myself to tell him\nmuch. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out.\n\n‘| felt very alone. | was having panic attacks and seeing a psychiatrist and was on anti-depressants.\n\n’ Virginia was beginning to put her Epstein days behind her when, three years ago, she was phoned by\nthe FBI.\n\n‘They said they had found photos of me at Jeffrey’s Palm Beach house,’ she says. ‘[Epstein had] hidden\ncameras watching me the entire time even when | was in the bathroom. | was so embarrassed.\n\n‘| told the FBI that my true purpose was sexual. They told me everything he did was illegal because | was\nunder age.’ (The age of consent in Florida is 18).\n\n‘They said that if it had to go to trial, they’d need me because I’d lived with him and that made me a key\nwitness. | was very afraid, because he had so much power, but eventually | agreed to testify.\n\n| was glad he’d finally been found out. He shouldn't be hurting other girls. Following Epstein’s arrest,\ninvestigators are believed to have found a list of men’s names on his computer and asked him whether\nthey had been ‘treated’ to sexual encounters with his menage of minors.\n\n‘He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question, it\ncould be incriminating,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday.\n\nEpstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a ‘slap on the wrist’ for him, and\nended up serving 13 months of his sentence, much of it in a liberal work-release programme Lawyer Brad\nEdwards, who represented several of Epstein’s victims, said: ‘Rather than punish him the way they would\nan average Joe, they sent a clear message that with enough money and power and influence, the system\ncan be bought.’\n\nVirginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings bottled up\nuntil last weekend’s photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361039/Prince-Andrew-girl-17-sex-offender-frie... 3/16/2011\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021709",
