  "text": "Betty Dodson, sex educator and producer of Viva La Vulva, says, “|\nthink we have changing ideas about what’ s public and what’ s private.\nAnd now that nudity is more public--nude beaches, routine nudity in film,\nand the enormous amount of exhibitionism and porn on the Web--I’ m\nnot surprised to see a trend toward pubic shaving. | think it’ s probably\nhere to stay.” She told me that, “Thanks to the lack of a comprehensive\nsex education for kids, young girls now want their vulvas to look like porn\nstars because that's what their boyfriends jerk off to and prefer. It's all they\nknow.” But a new study has concluded that pubic hair is returning: “The\nmen don’ tcare and the women don’ tcan’ t bother.”\n\nWelcome back, good old bush. Hide and seek a friendly clit.\n\nIronically, although Arnold Schwarzenegger was only joking when he\nannounced that 4e was going to get a Bikini wax, actually Beverly Hills skin\ncare and waxing expert Nance Mitchell has about fifty regular male\ncustomers that come for pubic waxing who “are not gay and they are not\nporn stars. Some go totally bare, some just do the shaft and up around the\npelvic area.” She explains that “It depends on what their wives and\ngirlfriends want. Men go along because removing the hair makes the\nwhole package look bigger.”\n\nAh, yes, the //usion of size does matter.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015346",
