  "text": "OUP CORRECTED PROOF - FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi\n\nxl The Crooked Course\n\nconflicts. These heroic attempts, facilitated by President Bill Clinton and his team,\ncreated a crisis of expectations, leading to the second Intifada and violent confrontation\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians, with tragic loss of life on both sides. This illustrates a\nfundamental dilemma in the choice between a gradualist and a totalist approach.\nTotalism’s “all or nothing” approach is inherently risky. When it backfires, it easily\nleads to a relapse into violence. Gradualism is less spectacular and appealing, with its\nincremental and long-term approach. However, it is precisely these characteristics\nwhich make it less risky, and more successful under some circumstances.\n\nWhile totalism failed in 2000, with tragic consequences, it nevertheless broke down a\nnumber of taboos, such as addressing explicitly the partition of Jerusalem and the issue\nof Palestinian refugees.\n\nON PART V: ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN\nDOMESTIC DOCUMENTS\n\nPart V seeks to provide a fuller context to the quest for peace in the Middle East. All\npolitics are local, and the Arab-Israeli conflict typifies this axiom. The ability of\nnegotiators to come to conclusions is only half the story. Documents such as the\noriginal Palestinian National Charter or Israel’s Declaration of Independence shaped\nattitudes, policies, and action on both sides.\n\nFurthermore, the Part includes important policy statements that signal revisions of\nprevious policies such as Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s vision\nfor a new Palestinian state. In August 2009, Fayyad introduced the “Program of the\nThirteenth Government” (the Fayyad Plan), which established a path to develop a\nfunctional Palestinian state within a two-year time frame. The blueprint sought to\nestablish and improve governing institutions, end Palestinian economic dependence on\nIsrael, and enhance overall infrastructure. It was a move to create a de facto Palestinian\nstate within the existing Palestinian territory, regardless of any formal recognition of\nsuch an entity. Fayyad sought proactive steps to “end the occupation, despite the\noccupation”. He stressed it was not meant as a unilateral declaration of statehood.\n\nIndeed, substantial developments did take place during Prime Minister Fayyad’s\ntenure. In 2011, both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund made\nstatements that the Palestinian Authority was capable of running the economy of an\nindependent state, and that it was on track to developing the necessary functions of a\nstate.\n\nThe Middle East peace process continues to run its crooked course. There is no quick\nfix. Yet, as this volume demonstrates, many brave attempts have been made to bring\npeace to this troubled region.\n\nBy compiling annotated documents related to the quest for peace in the Middle East,\na useful record and reference tool are created. Our hope is also that this volume will\ninspire future students, analysts, policy makers, and negotiators to learn from, and\ndraw on, the experiences of the past.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023172",
