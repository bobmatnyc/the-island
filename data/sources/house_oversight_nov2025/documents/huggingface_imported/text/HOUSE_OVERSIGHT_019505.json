He wrote that he wore “cool” purple sun-\nglasses, practiced martial arts, and was a fan of Japanese cuisine. He\ndescribed himself at one point, as if advertising his virtues, as having\na “head of vibrant, shimmering blond hair (with volume).”\n\nHe appeared somewhat restless with his solitary life in his almost\ndaily postings. He expressed a longing to go to Japan. “I’ve always\ndreamed of being able to ‘make it’ in Japan. I’ve taken Japanese for\na year and a half,” he wrote in 2002. Despite his claim of learning\nJapanese, there is no record of his taking any courses in Japanese.\nBut it was perhaps part of his yearning. In pursuit of an employ-\nment opportunity in Japan, he posted, “I’d love a cushy gov job over\nthere.” Eventually, he gave up on the idea of relocating himself to\nJapan because, as he explained in a post, he would have to put his cats\nin quarantine for six months.\n\nSnowden’s father meanwhile moved to Pennsylvania with his\n\n© new wife-to-be. This left Snowden with only one male family mem- ©\nber in the area, his maternal grandfather, Admiral Barrett, who was\nnow in the top echelon of U.S. intelligence working at the Pentagon.\nBarrett was there when a plane piloted by terrorists crashed into it\non 9/11. He emerged unscathed.\n\nSnowden sought to join the Special Forces through the 18X pro-\ngram, a U.S. Army Reserve program created in 2003 that allowed\nindividuals who had not served in the military or completed their\neducation to train to be a Special Forces recruit. He listed his religion\non the application as Buddhist because, as he explained in a sardonic\npost on Ars Technica, “agnostic is strangely absent” from the form.\n\nHe enlisted in the army reserves on May 7, 2004, according to\nU.S. Army records. He reported for a ten-week basic training at Fort\nBenning, Georgia, which was standard for all enlistees in the infan-\ntry. In August, he began a three-week course in parachute jumping\nbut did not complete that training. As Snowden put it in his Inter-\nnet postings, he “washed out.” He was discharged on September 29,\n2004, ending his nineteen-week military career. Snowden would\nlater claim on the Internet that he returned to civilian life because\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 17 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019505",
