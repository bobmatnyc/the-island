  "text": "COWEN\nCOLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019\n\n2\n\nCOWEN’S COLLECTIVE VIEW OF CBD\n\nIn a collaboration featuring 11 analysts across Cowen’s consumer, health care,\nindustrials and regulatory teams, herein we offer our outlook for the global CBD market,\nwith a particular focus on the U.S. While little science exists supporting medical efficacy\nof CBD (with the exception of seizures, which GWPharma was able to prove with\nEpidiolex for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, as discussed in more\ndetail herein), the popularity of CBD products seems to be growing exponentially in the\nU.S. Indeed, our consumer survey work suggest that close to 7% of adults in the U.S.\nalready use CBD as a supplement.\n\nWith the category gaining increasing interest from consumers we have seen a swell in\nproduct innovation. And, the opportunity is increasingly drawing the attention of larger\ncompetitors (where for instance, WEED announced that they would consider spending\nas much as $500 mm in U.S. hemp / CBD). By 2025, we estimate that the U.S. CBD\nmarket could approach $16 bn (from $600 mm -S2 bn in 2018}.\n\nHerein, we offer our views of:\n1. Consumer Products Market Sizing (Azer)\n2. The Science of CBD (Nadeau)\n3. The Hemp / CBD Supply Chain: From Cultivation to Extraction (Neivert & Schenkel)\n4. Consumer Products Opportunities (Azer)\n5. The CBD Competitive Landscape - Public and Private Company Discussions (Azer)\n6. Consumer Discretionary Retail and Brand Opportunities Across:\na. Pharmacy (Rhyee)\nb. E-Commerce (Blackledge)\nc. Broader Retail (Chen)\nd. Specialty Brands (Kernan)\n7. On-Premise Consumption Opportunities (Charles)\n8. U.S. Regulatory Outlook (Assaraf, Krueger, Seiberg & Weissenstein)\n9. Global CBD Landscape (Azer)\n10. Additional Potential Opportunities for Hemp / CBD, Including\na. Pharmaceutical Applications (Nadeau)\n\nb.
