  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nmore complex and troubling realities of the Harvard College program as it surely must operate in\npractice. (I have no inside knowledge of how the Harvard College admissions process actually\nworks; my speculations derive from reading the newspapers and from having publicly debated\nseveral Harvard officials on the Bakke issue.)\n\nFor example, Justice Powell was anything but clear about the degree to which an applicant’s race\nmay be considered in university admissions decisions. At different points in his opinion, he\narticulates different formulations of the limits on explicit consideration of race in attempts to\nproduce a diverse student body. He says that race must be “simply one element—to be weighed\nfairly against other elements—in the selection process”; that a school must place “all pertinent\nelements of diversity...on the same footing, for consideration, although not necessarily according\nthem the same weight”; and that a school must “adhere to a policy of individual comparisons.”\n\nLet us assume that Blank University seeks diversity by trying to include musicians, farm boys,\nOklahomans among its entering class, but that it does not instruct its admissions officers to aim\nfor a specified minimum number of musicians, farm boys and Oklahomans in each entering class.\nMay Blank University direct its admissions officers—either explicitly or implicitly—to make\ncertain that the number of blacks or Chicanos should not go beneath a certain approximate\npercentage in the class? Would that put race on a different “footing” than the other elements of\ndiversity?\n\nThe answer to that question may well turn on whether one looks for legal guidance to the\ndescription of the Harvard program as quoted in Mr. Justice Powell’s opinion, or to the real\nworld operation of the Harvard program as it probably works in practice. The following\ndescription certainly implies that race is not treated differently from other elements of diversity:\n\n“In Harvard College admissions the Committee has not set target-quotas for the number of blacks, or of\nmusicians, football players, physicists or Californians to be admitted in a given year. At the same time the\nCommittee is aware that if Harvard College is to provide a truly heterogeneous environment that reflects\nthe rich diversity of the United States, it cannot be provided without some attention to numbers. It would\nnot make sense, for example, to have 10 or 20 students out of 1,100 whose homes are west of the\nMississippi. Comparably, 10 or 20 black students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each\nother the variety of points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United States. Their\nsmall numbers might also create a sense of isolation among the black students themselves and thus make\nit more difficult for them to develop and achieve their potential. Consequently, when making its decisions,\nthe Committee on Admissions is aware that there is some relationship between numbers and achieving the\nbenefits to be derived from a diverse student body, and between numbers and providing a reasonable\nenvironment for those students admitted.\n\nA closer look at the admissions program in practice might well reveal that the Harvard admissions\nofficers, though interested in assuring geographic, occupational and musical diversity, really pay\nlittle or no attention to numbers: it would be no great crisis if one particular entering class at\nHarvard College had few or even no violinists, Oklahomans, or farm boys. (Football quarterbacks\nor basketball centers might be another thing altogether.) But these very same admissions officers\nmay well be under instructions—explicit or implicit—to pay close attention to the number of\nblacks so as to assure that the proportion does not fall below a certain approximate floor.\n\n298\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017385",
