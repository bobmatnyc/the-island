  "text": "11\n\nThat this idea is being introduced into the public discourse is\nrevealing, not only of Turkey's internal debate on this issue, but also\nof the message that Ankara may be trying to send to the United States\nand others: It needs time to develop the wherewithal to meaningfully\ninfluence its neighborhood. The United States wants Turkey to help\nshoulder the burden of managing the Middle East as it looks to\nextricate its military from Iraq. Washington especially needs to\ndevelop a strong counterbalance to Iran - a role historically filled by\nTurkey. This obviously presents a conflict of interests: Washington is\ntrying to push Turkey into a role it's not quite ready for; meanwhile,\nTurkey is trying to sort out its growing pains while appearing\ninfluential abroad.\n\nTurkey's evolution will be difficult and uncomfortable, but this\nshould not come as a surprise. \"Zero problems with neighbors\"\nworked well for Turkey at the start of the century, as it came out of its\ndomestic shell, yet took care to avoid being seen as a resurgent power\nwith imperial interests. After a decade of regional conflict, Turkey is\nfinding that problems with neighbors are not only unavoidable, but\nmay even be necessary as the Turkish state redefines its core interests.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030166",
