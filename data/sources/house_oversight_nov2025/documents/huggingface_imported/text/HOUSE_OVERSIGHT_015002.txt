Rich Beckler,
Ken Adams,

Do you remember when I'd asked you what your daughters did for a living? Especially last night Mr.
Beckler, as most Friday nights, no?

Yes, they are the new iterations of Ghislaine Maxwell; for you Richard Beckler, this originated from
my being a former Stone Ridge classmate of his elder daughter Katie Beckler, and because he was
on the Board of Stone Ridge during this period in time when my every family, friend, acquaintance
and association was being contacted, bribed in one form or another, and turned against me (see
below); as for Ken Adams, it stemmed from my having contacted him for representation in my 2011-
filed case against IBM also during this period of time when my every communication were being
tracked.

You both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom,
Ghislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.)
