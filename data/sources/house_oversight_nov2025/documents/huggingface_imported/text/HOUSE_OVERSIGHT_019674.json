  "text": "186 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nRussian troop movements in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine. U.S.\nintelligence officials even went so far as to suggest, according to a\nreport in The Wall Street Journal, that “Russian planners might\nhave gotten a jump on the West by evading U.S. eavesdropping.”\n\nBritain also discovered that some of its secret operations had been\ncompromised after Snowden went to Moscow. According to a 2015\nstory in the Sunday Times of London, British intelligence had deter-\nmined that Britain’s intelligence-gathering sources had been exposed\nto adversary services by documents that Snowden had stolen from\nthe NSA in 2013. These documents had been provided to the NSA\nby the GCHQ. Unless such intelligence disasters were freak aberra-\ntions, it appeared to confirm General Alexander’s warning in 2014\nthat the NSA was “losing some of its capabilities, because they’re\nbeing disclosed to our adversaries.”\n\nSnowden’s supporters disputed this view. If only as an act of faith\nin Snowden’s personal integrity, they continued to believe his avowal\nto Senator Humphrey that he had acted to protect U.S. secrets by\nshielding them from adversary intelligence services after he took\n\n® them abroad. They also continued to take him at his word when he ©\nsaid he had destroyed all the NSA documents before going to Rus-\nsia. Despite such protestations of patriotic loyalty, U.S. intelligence\nofficials could not so easily dismiss the possibility that the missing\ndocuments still existed. After all, a U.S. intelligence worker who is\ndedicated to protecting America’s secrets from its adversaries does\nnot ordinarily steal them.\n\nThe NSA, the CIA, and the Department of Defense therefore\nhad little choice but to assume the worst had happened: Russia and\nChina had obtained access to the “keys to the kingdom.” Whatever\nthe extent of the actual damage, it was up to Alexander’s replace-\nment, Admiral Michael Rogers, both to restore morale and to rebuild\nthe capabilities of America’s electronic intelligence in the wake of\nthe massive breach. According to a national security staff member\nin the Obama White House, that job would take more than a decade.\nThe NSA had failed to protect vital assets. This intelligence failure\ndid not happen out of the blue.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 186 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019674",
