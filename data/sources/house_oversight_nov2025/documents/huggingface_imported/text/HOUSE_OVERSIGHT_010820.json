Who's -\n\nQ. -~- of Composite Exhibit 10.\n\nMR. SCOTT: Let me see the page you're\ntalking about so he can --\n\nMR. SCAROLA: I've given you the entire\ncalendar.\n\nMR. SCOTT: Come on, Jack.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: I've given you the entire\ncomposite --\n\nTHE WITNESS: So you're talking about my\nwife's --\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Fourth page -- fourth page\nof Exhibit 10. You have Exhibit 10, I've given\na copy of that.\n\nMR. SCOTT: I understand it and he has it\nfront of him and I'm trying to get him to the\nright page. Thank you. Please take it down.\n\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\n\nQ. Fourth page, Composite Exhibit 10.\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Friday, January 12.\n\nA. Okay. That's very simple. We were both\nin Cambridge and I had a massage in Cambridge. How\ndo I know that? Because it had basketball. And\nthat's where J play and watch basketball was in\n\noO adn wo PP WN FR\n\nNN NNN NPP EP PP RP PP Pe\nUB WN FP OO MN HU PWNHR OO\n\n327\n\nA. Uh-huh.\n\nQ. Okay. Or from 3:30 to 4:15, that would be\na playing time for you in Cambridge; is that\ncorrect?\n\nA. You'd be asking me to speculate. I can't\nspeculate based on my wife's calendar. It says\nutility bill, Reservoir address. That suggests\nCambridge. Reservoir is our house in Cambridge.\n\nQ. So, it would appear that this is another\nmassage that you got somewhere?\n\nA. But 1 would like to also say one thing. I\ndon't -- I at least wonder were these records\navailable to your clients at the time they made the\nfalse accusations against me or arc they\naftcr-the-fact constructs designed to simply try to\nfind excuses to justify their false allegations? It\nseems to me the latter is probably the case.\n\nQ. And you are going to have an opportunity\nthrough your counsel to ask those questions.\n\nA. And we will.\n\nQ. And my clients are anxious to be able to\nanswer those questions.\n\nA. Not as anxious as I am to hear their\nanswers.\n\nQ. Okay.\n\n326\n\nCambridge. So probably I was in Cambridge if it\nsays B ball 3:30, 4:15 and says Cambridge with Ella,\nso I'm sure | was in Cambridge.\n\nQ. Allright. So-\n\nA. But I'm -- I'm looking at my wife's\ncalendar. I can't tell you and nor can you tell me\nwhere | was at that period of time.\n\nQ. So, the basketball entries are references\nto your watching basketball in Cambridge?\n\nA. No. They could be playing basketball. J\nplayed basketball in those days --\n\nQ. Watching or playing basketball?\n\nMR. SCOTT: Let him finish his answer,\nplease.\n\nA. either watched basketball or played\nbasketball, yeah. 1 did not go to basketball games\nin New York, to my recollection, unless the Celtics\nwere in New York and maybe we can check --\n\nMR. SCOTT: You've got about five minutes,\n\nCounsel,\n\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\n\nQ. The Celtics didn't play from 4:15 to 5:00,\ndid they?\n\nA. No, but I did.\n\nQ. You did?\n\noD MAH HP WN EF\n\n328\n\nMR. SCOTT: Okay. Let's wrap it up.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Not quite.\n\nMR. SCOTT: Yeah, it's 12:30. I'm ending\nthis. That gives you three and a half hours.\nWe take a lunch break and then we have three\nand a half.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: We don't need three and a\nhalf hours for lunch.\n\nMR. SCOTT: No, I didn't say that, I said\nwe take an hour break and then we have three\nand a half hours with your client, just like...\n\nMR. SCAROLA: If -- if that's what you\nwant to do --\n\nMR. SCOTT: That's the fair thing to do\nbecause that's why we're dividing it equally\nand I suggested that --\n\nMR. SCAROLA: | will state -- J will state\nfor the record that Exhibits 2, 3 and 4 --\nexcuse me, Exhibits 9, 10, 11 and 12,\ncomposite exhibits, directly conflict with the\nwitness's assertion --\n\nMR. SCOTT: This is all a speech on your\npart.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: It is a speech.\n\nMR.
