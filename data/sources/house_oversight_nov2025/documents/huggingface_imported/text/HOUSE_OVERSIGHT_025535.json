  "text": "“You are part of a worldwide movement that is bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary,\nbigger than all that,” Bannon told French populists.\n\nBannon showed that he “dominates the mood against the ‘elites,’ the ‘establishment’ and the ‘perverse\nsystem’ of greedy corporations and banks, and of course also against the press, which is led around ‘like a dog\non the Leash,’” Stamper writes.\n\nAnd now he Mr. Bannon setting himself up as an instigator, if not an outright shepherd, of a movement that\ncrosses borders, languages and parties.\n\n“Bannon is a master of apocalyptic rhetoric,” Stamper continues, effortlessly weaving together nationalist\ninterests with an international populist movement.\n\nThe American strategist showed his “true caliber” by expounding modern methods of political freedom\nthrough blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, Stamper said, leaving many of his hearers behind.\nBannon has demonstrated that if the right wants to rule the future, “it must dominate modern themes and\nrhetorically position them,” he added.\n\nAspiring to be far more than an uncle who tells stories to his nephews of how he won the fight for the White\nHouse, Stamper writes, “Bannon wants to become the super godfather of the international right.”\n\nAlthough Bannon often looks a bit disheveled, “he should not be underestimated,” the writer warns. Past\nbusiness partners attribute impressive “strategic foresight” to the eccentric tactician, saying he was often\n“three or four steps ahead” of his opponents in business. Because of his phenomenal memory, his nickname is\n“the encyclopedia,” Stamper notes with a certain reverence, and in his speeches he will spontaneously cite\n“forgotten thinkers, known only to a handful of specialists.”\n\n“Bannon brings with him exclusive knowledge of power from the very heart of power,” Stamper writes,\nwhich he will bring to bear on Europe’s fragmented populist populism.\n\nAccording to Stamper, Bannon has established his “European headquarters” in Italy, from where he intends to\ngalvanize European populists.\n\nThe Italian political situation is completely to his liking, Stamper declares, with a political landscape\n“dominated by populists, right-wing ideologues and the political puppeteer Berlusconi.”\n\nFollow Thomas D.
