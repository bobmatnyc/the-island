MENNINGER: Exactly. In the case of Adelson v.\n\nHarris, just like in this case, there was one allegedly\n\ndefamatory statement afterwards. There was a press release\nissued that stated, we stand by everything we said. Those\nfacts are very similar to ours, where there was a written\nstatement issued and then our client, did she or did she not\nrepublish that, is that a separate defamatory event.\n\nG\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. Thank you very much. Now, at least\n\na6}\n\nin this little small part of this dispute, I know where I am.\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nMS. MENNINGER: And the Adelson case, your Honor,\n\ncontrols and says that referring back to a statement, such as a\nprevious press release, is not actionable, and summary judgment\n\nhas been granted on such alleged republications. So now, in\n\nthis motion in limine, is not the time to be dealing with the\n\nsubstantive point that plaintiff basically conceded during\nsummary judgment.\n\nThank you.\n\nMS. SCHULTZ: Hi, your Honor. Meredith Schultz,\ncounsel for Ms. Giuffre.\n\nThis motion in limine has already been decided by this\n\nCourt's summary judgment order, thereby rendering it moot in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011397",
