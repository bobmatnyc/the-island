Nestor,\nwherein the Court held that an individual does not have an accrued\n“property right” in Social Security benefits. The Court has made clear in\nsubsequent decisions that the payment of Social Security taxes conveys\nno contractual rights to Social Security benefits.\n\nMedicaid — Benefit levels & eligibility are determined jointly by Federal\n\nand State governments.
