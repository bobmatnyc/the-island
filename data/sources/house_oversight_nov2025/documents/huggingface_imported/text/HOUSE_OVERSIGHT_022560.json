These types of\npolicies and procedures will depend on the size and nature\nof the business and the risks associated with the business.\nEffective policies and procedures require an in-depth\nunderstanding of the company’s business model, includ-\ning its products and services, third-party agents, custom-\ners, government interactions, and industry and geographic\nrisks. Among the risks that a company may need to address\ninclude the nature and extent of transactions with foreign\ngovernments, including payments to foreign officials; use\nof third parties; gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses;\ncharitable and political donations; and facilitating and\nexpediting payments. For example, some companies with\nglobal operations have created web-based approval pro-\ncesses to review and approve routine gifts, travel, and enter-\ntainment involving foreign officials and private customers\nwith clear monetary limits and annual limitations. Many of\nthese systems have built-in flexibility so that senior manage-\nment, or in-house legal counsel, can be apprised of and, in\nappropriate circumstances, approve unique requests. These\ntypes of systems can be a good way to conserve corporate\nresources while, if properly implemented, preventing and\ndetecting potential FCPA violations.\n\nRegardless of the specific policies and procedures\nimplemented, these standards should apply to personnel at\n\nall levels of the company.\n\nOversight, Autonomy, and Resources\n\nIn appraising a compliance program, DOJ and SEC\nalso consider whether a company has assigned respon-\nsibility for the oversight and implementation of a com-\npany’s compliance program to one or more specific senior\nexecutives within an organization.*”? Those individuals\n\nmust have appropriate authority within the organization,\n\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\n\nadequate autonomy from management, and sufficient\nresources to ensure that the company’s compliance program\nis implemented effectively?’ Adequate autonomy gener-\nally includes direct access to an organization’s governing\nauthority, such as the board of directors and committees\nof the board of directors (e.g., the audit committee)3”\nDepending on the size and structure of an organization,\nit may be appropriate for day-to-day operational responsi-\nbility to be delegated to other specific individuals within\na company.*® DOJ and SEC recognize that the reporting\nstructure will depend on the size and complexity of an\norganization. Moreover, the amount of resources devoted\nto compliance will depend on the company’s size, complex-\nity, industry, geographical reach, and risks associated with\nthe business. In assessing whether a company has reasonable\ninternal controls, DOJ and SEC typically consider whether\nthe company devoted adequate staffing and resources to the\n\ncompliance program given the size, structure, and risk pro-\n\nfile of the business.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nAssessment of risk is fundamental to developing a\nstrong compliance program, and is another factor DOJ\nand SEC evaluate when assessing a company’s compliance\nprogram.?!” One-size-fits-all compliance programs are\ngenerally ill-conceived and ineffective because resources\ninevitably are spread too thin, with too much focus on low-\nrisk markets and transactions to the detriment of high-risk\nareas. Devoting a disproportionate amount of time polic-\ning modest entertainment and gift-giving instead of focus-\ning on large government bids, questionable payments to\nthird-party consultants, or excessive discounts to resellers\nand distributors may indicate that a company’s compli-\nance program is ineffective. A $50 million contract with a\n\ngovernment agency in a high-risk country warrants greater\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022560",
