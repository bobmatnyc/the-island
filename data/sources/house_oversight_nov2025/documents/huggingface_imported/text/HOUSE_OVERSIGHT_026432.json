It was established in\n2008 by the 3 founding partners of TIIC Group, Jaime d’Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with\nstrategic support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa.\n\nThe aim of TIIC Group is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing\nupon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed\nover many years at some of Europe’s leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which,\nwhen combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group\nand Brisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform.\n\nTIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant\ninvestment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors,\noperators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry.\n\nTIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation\ninvestments across Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain,\nFrance and Poland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield\nprojects in roads and car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all\ninvestments and has made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high\nquality, operationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential\ninvestors over the coming few years.\n\nTIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group’ differentiated approach to\ninfrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026432",
