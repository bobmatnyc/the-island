It would be inconceivable for an intelligence service to bring\na potential espionage source such as Snowden to Russia and allow\nhim to catch the next plane to Latin America. The false report pro-\nvided to the press that Snowden was flying there was likely nothing\nmore than a smoke screen to confuse foreign observers while he was\nreceiving his initial debriefing and evaluation.\n\nWhen it comes to the esoteric enterprise of reconstructing the\nwork of U.S. communications intelligence, military as well as civilian\nexperts in cryptology, computer sciences, and communications are\nnecessary. Unlike in the case of Pelton, Snowden, according to Ana-\ntoly Kucherena, had secret material in his possession. Even if Rus-\nsian intelligence had already acquired copies of the electronic files\nprior to Snowden’s arrival in Moscow, Snowden’s interpretation of\nthem would be part of the debriefing because intelligence data needs\nto be put in context.\n\n“This debriefing could not be done overnight,” according to a for-\nmer high-ranking officer in the GRU, the Russian military intel-\n\n© ligence service. “There is no way that Snowden would not be fully ©\ndebriefed,” he said. He also said GRU specialists in signals intelli-\ngence would be called in.\n\nPutin’s approval of the Snowden operation was not without con-\nsequences. Not only did Obama make good on his threat to can-\ncel the pre-Olympics summit with Putin, but also, as it turned out,\nthe Snowden exfiltration proved a turning point in the “reset” of\nU.S.-Russian relations. Having to accept the onus of declining rela-\ntions with the Obama administration, Putin, it seems safe to assume,\nattempted to get the bonus of the NSA’s communications intelli-\ngence from Snowden. The GRU, the SVR, and other Russian intel-\nligence services would not stop questioning Snowden, even if it took\nyears, until they had squeezed out of him whatever state secrets he\nhad. Because Snowden was rewarded with sanctuary, a residence, and\nbodyguards, there is no reason to doubt that he refused to accommo-\ndate his hosts. While he might continue to see himself as a whistle-\nblower on a supranational scale, as far as Russian intelligence was\nconcerned, he was an espionage source.\n\nFor an intelligence service, the game is not over when it obtains\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 287 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019775",
