Not really.\nWho can? The rich and powerful.\nHuh? All they want is the status quo. Or more.\n\nBut they could --- okay, it's not likely, but they could --- turn on the bad actors at their social/economic level.\nFor example: Wall Street CEOs, donors to the Tea Party, etc.\n\nThat's the topic. Shaming. Shunning.\nOne of the people I deal with --- there are several others. --- is Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nReading the clips, I don't see that Jeffrey as been shunned.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031691",
