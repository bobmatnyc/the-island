GW’s CBDV\ndrug is in a 10 patient investigator sponsored trial in autism spectrum disorders, and a\nPhase II 100 patient placebo controlled trial in this indication began in December 2018.\nGW is also investigating CBDV for use in epilepsy, though the first clinical trial was not\nsuccessful.\n\nZynerba studied its transdermal CBD gel ZYNOO2 in Fragile X syndrome ina 12 week\nPhase || open-label study in children and adolescents. In the trial, patients were initiated\nona dose of 50mg daily with the option to titrate up to 250mg daily. The primary\nendpoint was the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS) Total Score. Twenty\npatients were enrolled, 18 of whom completed the 12 week treatment. At 12 weeks,\ntwo patients were on 100mg and 16 were on 250mg. On the primary endpoint, subjects\nsaw an average improvement of 14.1 points (or 45.8%) from baseline (p<0.0001) with\nthe greatest improvements seen in social avoidance (52.9%), general anxiety (54.0%),\nand manic/hyperactive behavior (p=0.0003). Twelve patients continued in a long-term\nextension study out to 12 months of follow up. These patients showed statistically\nsignificant improvements in mean % change from baseline in ADAMS Total Score, as\nwell. The extension trial also contributed to a more robust safety dataset. The most\ncommon treatment-emergent adverse events were gastroenteritis (14%) and upper\nrespiratory tract infection (12%); no serious AEs were reported. A randomized, double-\nblind, placebo-controlled trial to extend these findings to a larger population is ongoing\nin Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S.\n\nFigure 130 ZYNOO2 Produced Reductions In ADAMS At 12 Weeks...
