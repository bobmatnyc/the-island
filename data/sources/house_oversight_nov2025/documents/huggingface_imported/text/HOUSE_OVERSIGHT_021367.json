  "text": "well as apparent accidents of fortune like\ncar crashes and the weather. Though\nretaining personal characteristics such as\nlove or anger, God operates less like an\nindividual human person with limited\nreach and partial interests, and more like\nlight, air or gravity do—quite\npervasively and constantly.\n\nUsually one side or the other\ncomes to the fore in the way Christians\nfeel connected to God: for some\nChristians the personal side of God is\ncentral; for others, the more impersonal.\nThus, some Christians expect God to be\nvery much like a human friend, offering\ncompanionship and good advice.“ As\nTanya Luhrmann explores in her essay,\ntheir religious lives often revolve around\nthe internal sensory or imaginative\nexperiences that make a God of that sort\nseem real to them--the sense that God is\nin the room with them, that God speaks\nto them, and so on. They work to\ncultivate a prayer life that heightens the\nvividness of those experiences and\nthereby allays doubts about the actual\nexistence of this invisible, otherwise\nseemingly unreal, divine friend. In short,\ngood practitioners of prayer gain a\nstronger and more reliable sense that\nGod is present as a friend directing the\ncourse of their lives.\n\nOther Christians have\nexpectations of a more overarching and\nimpersonal sort about the way God is a\nforce in their lives; these expectations, I\nsuggest below, are the consequence of\ntheir holding certain beliefs about God\nas the creator, sustainer, and savior of\nthe world. In this case a strong sense of\nGod’s presence in one’s life does not\ndepend on having experiences of a\nliterally personal sort or on developing\nthe spiritual practices that help cultivate\nsuch experiences. The sense that God is\npresent as an influence on one’s life is\n\n121\n\nPage\n\nrather something one feels all the time\nsimply in virtue of the beliefs one holds\nabout God and the world. Given a\nparticular construal of those beliefs—a\nrelatively impersonal one, I argue—\nsimply having those beliefs in mind,\nwith some awareness of their quite\nobvious presuppositions and\nimplications, makes clear one is never\nalone, never a self-sufficient operator. In\ncontrast to the understanding of God as\nfriend, here God’s invisibility does not\nthreaten to interrupt a sense of God’s\npresence and influence. God’s\ninvisibility to the contrary enables the\nsense of God’s presence and influence to\nbe the routine backdrop of all one’s\nexperience, to constitute a general\noutlook on the world, no matter what the\ncircumstances.\n\nBelief in Creation as a Backdrop to\nthe Whole of Life\n\nFor example, a common\nChristian construal of the belief that God\nis the creator of the world makes it\npossible for the sense that God is with\none—one’s supporter and sustainer—to\nbe a constant feature of one’s life as a\nwhole. Contrary to first impressions,\nGod’s creation of the world need not\nrefer to the origin of the universe, or to\nthe beginning of its more specific\nfeatures or components. Were either to\nbe its meaning, belief in God as the\ncreator of the world could not be a very\ncentral component of a generally\napplicable Christian outlook, of much\nrelevance, that is, for more than the\noccasional speculation about origins:\ne.g., why am I here at all? The belief\nconcerns instead a causal dependence\nupon God of a more continuous sort,\nspanning, in short, the whole time of the\nuniverse’s existence and therefore the\nwhole time of one’s individual life. To\nbe created by God is to exist in a relation\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021367",
