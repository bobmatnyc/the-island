Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition,\nacknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-\nheeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment.\nThe police were still researching the purchase when Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the\nmoney returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local attorneys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to\nthe Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate” about massages being “therapeutically and\nspiritually” beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage training.)\n\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel,\nowner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova\n“deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly\ngirls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.)\n\nBrunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He\nlives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York,\nMiami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been\nobserved as a house guest at Epstein’s Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New\nYork, where Epstein owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch.\nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted in\nMichael Gross’ book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugly Business _of Beautiful Women. Pyes told\nthe author that Brunel “ranks among the sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We’re talking about a\nconveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls were not only harassed but molested.” Now The Daily\nBeast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire transfer to Brunel’s offshore bank account in\nSeptember 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan or a backdoor investment in\nthe new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving evidence in the Epstein\ninvestigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April of Brunel’s activities,\nEpstein said “I’m 100 percent convinced that he doesn’t traffic children.” (Brunel has never been charged.)\nAn American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very\nbeautiful; many were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency’s\nMiami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became\nfrequent guests on Epstein’s private jets.\n\nPilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. Other\ntimes, the pilot would just list the other passengers plus \"female.”\n\nPosted 02 August 2010 - 12:47 AM\n\nJeffrey Epstein, Jew Billionaire Pedophile, Child Trafficker Goes Free..WoW! 20 year old Hearsay is enough to destroy catholic priest.
