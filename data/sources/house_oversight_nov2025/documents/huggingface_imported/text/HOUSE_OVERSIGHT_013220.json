For instance, melting and boiling at least should be doable: assign every\nbead a temperature, and let solid interbead bonds turn liquid above a certain temperature and\ndisappear completely above some higher temperature. You could even have a simple form of fire.\nLet fire be an element, whose beads have negative gravitational mass. Beads of fuel elements\nlike wood have a threshold temperature above which they will turn into fire beads, with release\nof additional heat.?\n\nThe philosophy underlying these suggested bead dynamics is somewhat comparable to that\noutlined in Wolfram’s book A New Kind of Science [Wol02]. There he proposes cellular au-\ntomata models that emulate the qualitative characteristics of various real-world phenomena,\nwithout trying to match real-world data precisely. For instance, some of his cellular automata\ndemonstrate phenomena very similar to turbulent fluid flow, without implementing the Navier-\nStokes equations of fluid dynamics or trying to precisely match data from real-world turbulence.\nSimilarly, the beads in BlocksNBeadsWorld are intended to qualitatively demonstrate the real-\nworld phenomena most useful for the development of humanlike embodied intelligence, without\ntrying to precisely emulate the real-world versions of these phenomena.\n\nThe above description has been left imprecisely specified on purpose. It would be straight-\nforward to write down a set of equations for the block and bead interactions, but there seems\nlittle value in articulating such equations without also writing a simulation involving them and\ntesting the ensuing properties. Due to the complex dynamics of bead interactions, the fine-\ntuning of the bead physics is likely to involve some tuning based on experimentation, so that\nany equations written down now would likely be revised based on experimentation anyway. Our\ngoal here has been to outline a certain class of potentially useful environments, rather than to\narticulate a specific member of this class.\n\nWithout the beads, BlocksNBeads World would appear purely as a “Blocks World with Glue”\n— essentially a substantially upgraded version of the Blocks Worlds frequently used in AI, since\nfirst introduced in [Win72]. Certainly a pure “Blocks World with Glue” would have greater\nsimplicity than BlocksNBeadsWorld, and greater richness than standard Blocks World; but\nthis simplicity comes with too many limitations, as shown by consideration of the various naive\nphysics requirements inventoried above. One simply cannot run the full spectrum of humanlike\ncognitive development experiments, or preschool educational tasks, using blocks and glue alone.\nOne can try to create analogous tasks using only blocks and glue, but this quickly becomes\nextremely awkward. Whereas in the BlocksNBeadsWorld the capability for this full spectrum\nof experiments and tasks seems to fall out quite naturally.\n\nWhat’s missing from BlocksNBeadsWorld should be fairly obvious. There isn’t really any\ndistinction between a fluid and a powder: there are masses, but the types and properties of the\nmasses are not the same as in the real world, and will surely lack the nuances of real-world fluid\ndynamics. Chemistry is also missing: processes like cooking and burning, although they can be\ncrudely emulated, will not have the same richness as in the real world. The full complexity of\nbody processes is not there: the body-design method mentioned above is far richer and more\nadaptive and responsive than current methods of designing virtual bodies in 3DSMax or Maya\nand importing them into virtual world or game engines, but still drastically simplistic compared\nto real bodies with their complex chemical signaling systems and couplings with other bodies\nand the environment. The hypothesis we’re making in this section is that these lacunae aren’t\n\n2 Thanks are due to Russell Wallace for the suggestions in this paragraph\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013220",
