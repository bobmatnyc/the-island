Assad has not yet fallen. The Iranian nuclear programme\nis proceeding apace. Tehran's Hezbollah client is in effective control\nof Lebanon. But it does mean that in future the Iranian appeal is\nlikely to be more decisively limited to areas of Shia population.\n\nThe less good news, from Israel's point of view, is that the new forces\non the rise in the region consist largely of one or another variant of\nSunni Islamism. AKP-led Turkey has emerged as a key facilitator of\nthe Syrian opposition, in which Sunni Islamist elements play a\nprominent role. Turkey appears to be in the process of making a bid\nfor the regional leadership also sought by Iran. In Egypt, too, the\nMuslim Brotherhood and other Islamist forces look set to reap an\nelectoral dividend in November. The Sinai area has already become a\nzone of activity for Islamist terror directed against Israel, because of\nthe breakdown in law and order in recent months. The attacks on the\npipeline bringing Egyptian gas to Israel, and the recent terror attack\nin Eilat, are testimony to this. So while the \"Shia crescent\" may have\nsuffered a strategic setback as a result of the upheavals in the Arab\nworld, the space left by the fall of regional leaders looks to be filled\nlargely by new, Sunni Islamist forces. Israel remains capable of\ndefending itself against a strategic threat posed by any constellation\nof these elements. But the current flux in the region is likely to\nproduce a more volatile, complex Middle East, consisting of an Iran-\nled camp and perhaps a number of Sunni competitors, rather than the\ntwo-bloc contest of pro-US and pro-Iranian elements which preceded\n2011.\n\nJonathan Spyer is a senior research fellow at the Global Research in\nInternational Affairs Center.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025021",
