  "text": "In the long distance running model of spiritual transformation, the first energy\nappears suddenly in the middle of painful fatigue and feels like a vigorous\nimplementation of Halachic commands or Canon Law. The second burst of energy\nemerges from readiness for resignation and ends in humane comprehension and\nempathy. In some Christian monastic practice, a similar transition is represented in\nthe ritual of Tenebrae (or Darkness). Fifteen lit, unbleached candles are\nextinguished, one by one over the night, while reading the Psalms. The practice is\nsaid to represent the desertion of Christ by his disciples, as the church grows darker\nover the night. After the singing of the Benedictus, the one remaining light is\nquenched, plunging the church into total darkness. In Myth and Ritual in\nChristianity, Alan Watts suggests that the loss of the last light of Tenebrae induces\nthe realization that “| am nothing.” This reduction in egocentrism, along with a dark-\npiercing alertness is said to facilitate an invasion by a loving God that precipitates\nthe fasting, sleep deprived and praying petitioners into long lasting ecstatic states.\n\nThese uses of energy and its attendant characteristics are not physically\nspecifiable but rather hermeneutic of a force. It is both a potential and a realization,\nobserved and inferred. It is the “energy stuff’ of Freud’s /ibido, Wilhelm Reich’s\norgone energy, Pavlov’s drive, Rudolph Steiner etheric formative force, the\narousal and attention of brain wave and consciousness research, the Ch’ of\nChinese medicine, the Hindu divine energy of Shakti, the Hebraic ruach, the\nCabalist’s Yesod, the Sufis Baraka, the Christian Holy Spirit, the Yogic breath\nenergy, prana, Mesmer’s animal magnetism, Galvani’s life force, Goethe’s\nGestaltung, Madam Blavatsky’s astral light, Georg Groddeck’s it, Henri Bergson’s\nelan vitale, Schroedingers entropy, Abraham Maslow, Ruth Benedict and\nBuckminister Fuller's synergy, Bertalanffy’s anamorphosis, Colin Wilson’s x factor\nand George De la Warr’s biomagnetism. Of course, by nationality, culture and field\nof study, there are many more examples, each locally defined by its particular\ncontext and haunting with its promise of universality.\n\nEnergy in the context of mathematical physics is intuitional, abstract and\nrelational. It is not created or destroyed, but rather transformed. Consistent with his\n\ndeceptively simple style of physical intuition training of the young, Feynman’s\n\n45\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013545",
