At that time, my\nambition, ego, or stupidity limited the discussion. My memory is you, after discussions with Larry Summers,\ndecided the pursuit was not worth the prey. Now, age (which I laughingly call maturity) or new information,\nhas opened doors that I believe we can now accomplish the goals we discussed some years ago.\n\nIf, at a time and place of your convenience, you had 30 minutes for me to outline the fundamentals of the plan,\nyou would know what I believe would work and if your mental quickness is still there, you would know\nwhether or not you wanted to proceed. Certainly, when the goal is so great, 30 minutes with an old friend is not\na great sacrifice.\n\nOn a personal note, your friend, Larry Summers, recently gave a meaningful speech in Toronto entitled “Will\n2014 End Up Like 1914”. You may find it worth reading. Your friend, Donald Trump recently purchased a\nproject we developed on the west coast of Ireland, Doonbeg Golf Club. It has been consistently rated the best\nresort in Europe.\n\nJeffrey, please let me know when and where this is convenient for you.\nJerry\n\nGerald G. Barton\n\nLandmark Land Company, Inc.\nP.O.
