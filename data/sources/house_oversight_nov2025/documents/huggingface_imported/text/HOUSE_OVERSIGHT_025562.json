For\ntraditionals we look at total redemption rates. For the alternatives\nwe look at realizations/harvesting of investments along with\nredemptions of open ended products from fee paying AUM as it is\nmore comparable to traditional asset managers. If we take 1 divided\nby the redemption rate, we can back into an average duration of\nassets under management.
