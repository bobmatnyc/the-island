In 2015, for instance,\nWikiLeaks offered $100,000 bounties to any whistle-blowers who\nprovided the site with secret documents exposing details of the\nTrans-Pacific Trade Agreement.\n\nNor is acting alone necessarily a line that divides whistle-blowers\nfrom spies. In many cases, whistle-blowers have accomplices who\nhelp them carry out their mission. For example, in 1969, the cel-\nebrated whistle-blower Daniel Ellsberg, a military analyst at the\nRand Corporation, had an accomplice, Anthony Russo, who had also\nworked at Rand. (Both were indicted by the government.) Acting in\nconcert, they copied secret documents that became known famously\nas the Pentagon Papers.\n\nWhistle-blowers can also, like conventional spies, enter into elabo-\nrate conspiracies to carry out an operation. On the night of March 8,\n1971, eight whistle-blowers working together with burglary tools\nbroke into the FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, and stole almost all\nthe FBI files there. The conspirators escaped and kept their identities\nsecret for over forty-two years.\n\n© Self-definitions also do not necessarily produce a distinction ©\nbetween whistle-blowers and conventional spies. Consider Philip\nAgee, who left the CIA in 1969 for what he described as “reasons\nof conscience.” Specifically, he said he objected to the CIA’s covert\nsupport of Latin American dictators. After contacting the Soviet\nembassy in Mexico City, he defected to Cuba, where he leaked infor-\nmation that exposed CIA operations. Although Agee insisted he was\na whistle-blower, and he adamantly denied offering any secrets to the\nSoviet Union, the KGB viewed him as a conventional spy. Accord-\ning to Oleg Kalugin, the top Soviet counterintelligence officer in the\nKGB in Moscow, who defected to the United States, Agee offered\nCIA secrets first to the KGB residency in Mexico City in 1973 and\nthen to the Cuban intelligence service. Agee provided the KGB with\na “treasure trove” of U.S. secrets, Kalugin revealed. “I then sat in\nmy office in Moscow reading the growing list of revelations coming\nfrom Agee.” Despite this disparity, Agee still defined himself to the\npublic as a whistle-blower because he also had exposed CIA opera-\ntions to the public.\n\nThe Snowden case blurs the demarcation line even further.
