I prepared one column for him \nand the several feet of decorative molding, but this was a miss. He told me it looks like it was done yesterday. \nThis is the very first time that I work like this. I did several projects for French customers in Greenwich, Conn., but always I \nproduced the sample and than work \naccording to the samples. The paneling I work on were early 19 c. so even the oak looked different. Even at the White House, \nwhen I was restoring Blue Room, which you can look at it on my Website, www.brandonthompsonrestoration.com I produced \ndesign, made samples and did the project. President Clinton told me this is the most beautiful Room, he was clearly \nimpressed. \nThis time I know exactly what Mr. Epstein wants. However it might be too late. He will come tomorrow to check. \nToday I did a lot of prep work for tomorrow. I will go tonight to work on some of the columns but the night light is deceiving \nand I may miss the last chance he gave me. \nSo far I was rated the best finisher, until now I guess. \nWarm regards \nBrandon \nOn Tue, May 12, 2015 at 9:42 PM, Brandon Thompson wrote: \nDear Richard, \nthe samples are ready for approval. I finished one column about 95%, as I want to put some accents on it but after I discuss it \nwith Mr. Epstein. I also finished upper section above the blackboard. I also finished some other columns, not completely, \nbecause I need the approval. My feeling is that someone was already working in the Library, as I can see a lot of waxing done. \nI finished one column so it will correspond with the rest of the decor. You can not remove the whitish color completely. \nThere are some \"bald\" columns, which in my opinion do not sort of belong to the Library any more as they are completely \nbrown. Everything has to have at least an shadow of what is around. The top carving, moldings columns and other elements \nin the Library, have to \"bond\" together. The upper small carvings, have to be finished individually, as a play between the \nwhitish color and natural brown color of oak wood. I sort of model the shapes of the crabs, snails and other creatures and \nthey come alive. I think I did good work but Mr. Epstein needs to approve it so I can go ahead and finish the project. \nKindly, \nBrandon \nOn Mon, May 11, 2015 at 6:45 PM, Brandon Thompson < wrote: \nDear Richard, \nI prepared some samples for Mr. Epstein for today. I did not waist time as there is a lot of work in the Library. However, I \nneed his approval to continue. Tonight I will go back and start installation of the doors and panels. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030218 \nOn Sun, May 10, 2015 at 9:48 PM, Brandon Thompson \nDear Richard, \nI am not sure whether the photos depict the column right. I looked at it and does not do the justice to what you have on \nthe column. I hope you can see the details like even changing the white areas into rubbed ones and emphasising crabs. \nMaking the rope \"wet\" looking, contrasting the rubbed areas with white, and looking at the entire column as a whole. \nAll the columns are looking different, as somebody would work previously on them, and some of them are over-rubbed, \nsome of them are not rubbed at all. The upper part also, I prepared a sample, so Mr. Epstein can see the difference. \nBrandon \n> wrote: \nOn Sun, May 10, 2015 at 9:35 PM, Brandon Thompson > wrote: \nDear Richard, \nIt is after 9:20 pm and I tried to text Ann, but she did not answer.

Ann, the manager here called \nme that there was change in schedule and Mr. Epstein is expected to come tomorrow early afternoon. \n> For this presentation, I finished one column for him. \n> This is not a regular work that I have done on it. Actually, I balanced the \"whites\" and \"darker\" rubbed off elements. \nFurther, I balanced shiny areas and matt. \n> After doing this, I worked on differentiating darker areas, making them lighter and darker, depending on the location. I \ndid the same with \"whites\". Then I emphasized certain elements even more, like rope, net, crabs. This work requires \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030220 \nmore than finisher to do it. I have high hopes, than this time Mr. Epstein will like the work. If he accepts finishing this \nway, I will finish it may be even this coming week, providing, I can work 10-12 hours a day. I do not want to work even \nlonger hours, because you are not sharp and still you can spoil delicate balance required for this finish. \n> Do you want me to send you some photos? I will be glad to. The column still, has to be viewed from all sides. \n> Kindly, \n> \n> Brandon \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030221",
