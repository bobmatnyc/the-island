  "text": "defendants, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the plaintiff and her\nunborn child.\n\n... 69. As the direct and proximate result of defendant Palmisano, Skoog, Susan Horton, and Scala's\nconduct, the plaintiff suffered a severe placental abruption, which terminated her pregnancy and\nended the life of her unborn child, causing the plaintiff to suffer damages including but not limited to\nthe loss of her child, loss of affection, grief, sorrow, extreme mental torment and emotional distress.\n\n- Initial Complaint, filed 5/16/11, McGuire v. IBM, et al, Case No.: 1:11CV528, US District Court of\nVirginia - Eastern Division, Alexandria, Judge Leonie Brinkema presiding\n\nThis is to say that John and Avery Gunther helped IBM defend against an allegation of murder, and\nin this way they are accomplices to a cover-up. This is also to say that the characterization provided\nby John and Avery Gunther in their April 2011 Superior Court filing for a Protection Order against me\nand their admissions in this filing of having provided derogatory information to various persons\nand/or entities in the DC area to include school administrators, psychologists, and law enforcement,\nwere more to harm me, especially in my chances to hold IBM accountable, than to protect either\nthemselves or children Anjulee and Xian Gunther.\n\n| also long-allege that the relationship that developed from this initial quid pro quo led to John and\nAvery Gunther being similarly compensated for what turned into the sexual exploitation of their two\ndaughters. For more on child sexual exploitation for the sake of personal and professional leverage,\nsee especially the following:\n\nNick Bryant | The Franklin Scandal & The Elite’s Pedophilia Cover Up,\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68qvGGPjm0o0&t=978s\n\nThat the NSF won't acknowledge the abuse, and won't respond even to my FOIA requests, and\notherwise has gone to extents to protect Cathie Skoog and her co-conspirators at IBM and otherwise\nis all that was needed to have adequately turned the organization towards the interests of the Deep\nState. Now it is simply a matter of the Deep State continuing to put the NSF to use.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nJeffrey Epstein in context:\n(As sent to the Wash Post)\n\n| send you this in response to the recent column entitled Believe in the Process by Kenneth Starr.\nPerhaps rethink any public affiliation with Ken Starr; although his demeanor on paper is undoubtably\nconsoling, it is also a bit intoxifying when it would be best now if we keep our wits about us, no?\n\n| say this from the following perspective - Ken Starr of the Starr Report, attorney for (1) Erik Prince of\nBlackwater and (2) convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in context:\n\nThe Starr Report buried behind salacious detail of the Lewinsky affair almost nothing of Whitewater,\nTravelgate, or otherwise what many consider the murder of Vince Foster (Foster, albeit the subject\nof a different investigation was also under the purview of attorney Starr and formal investigation of\nthe results of Starr's investigation were drowned out by the details of the Lewinsky affair.) This is a\nbit strange considering the Lewinsky affair was a moral failing and not an actionable criminal one as\nwould have been the others had any proof surfaced.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015024",
