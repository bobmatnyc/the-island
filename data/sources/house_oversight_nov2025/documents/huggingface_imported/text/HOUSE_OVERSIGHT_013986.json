Make an anonymous donation to the service organization of your choice.\nThis helps to get the juices flowing and disassociate feeling good about service with getting credit for it.\nIt feels even better when it’s pure. Here are some good sites to get started:\n\n»Charity Navigator (www.charitynavigator.org)\n\nThis independent service ranks more than 5,000 charities using criteria you select. Create a personalized\npage of favorites and compare them side by side, all free of charge.\n\n»Firstgiving (www.firstgiving.com)\nFirstgiving.com allows you to create an online fund-raising page. Donations can be made through your\n\npersonal URL. I have used Firstgiving in coordination with a nonprofit called Room to Read to build\nschools in both Nepal and Vietnam, with more countries pending: www _firstgiving.com/timferriss and\nwww .firstgiving.com/timferriss2. If you specifically want to help animals, for example, you can click on\na related link and access websites for hundreds of different animal charities, and then decide which one\nyou want to donate to. The UK version of the website is http://www.justgiving.com.\n\n»Network for Good (www.networkforgood.org)\nVisitors to this website will find links to charities in need of donations as well as opportunities to do\nvolunteer work. They can also set up an automated credit card donation online.\n\n3. Take a learning mini-retirement in combination with local volunteering.\n\nTake a mini-retirement—six months or more if possible—to focus on learning and serving. The longer\nduration will permit a language focus, which in turn enables more meaningful interaction and\ncontribution through volunteering.\n\nFor the duration of this trip, note self-criticisms and negative self-talk in a journal. Whenever upset or\nanxious, ask “why” at least three times and put the answers down on paper. Describing these doubts in\nwriting reduces their impact twofold. First, it’s often the ambiguous nature of self-doubt that hurts most.\nDefining and exploring it in writing —just as with forcing colleagues to e-mail—demands clarity of\nthought, after which most concerns are found to be baseless. Second, recording these concerns seems to\nsomehow remove them from your head.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013986",
