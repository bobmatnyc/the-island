He then proceeded to Russia, which has no\nextradition treaty with the United States. Russia granted him asy-\nlum, making it unlikely that U.S. authorities would ever have the\nopportunity to question him.\n\nSnowden’s escape left in its wake an incredibly important unsolved\nmystery: How hada young analyst in training at the NSA succeeded\nin penetrating all the layers of NSA security to pull off the largest\ntheft of secret documents in the history of American intelligence?\nDid he act alone? What happened to the documents? Was his arrival\nin Russia part of the plan?\n\nBecause I had written several books on the vulnerability of intelli-\ngence services, this was a mystery—a “howdunit,” if you like—that\nimmediately intrigued me. Even if Snowden had acted for the most\nsalutary of reasons, the unauthorized transfer of state secrets from\nthe United States to an adversary country is, by almost any defini-\ntion, a form of espionage.\n\n® I decided to begin my investigation of this case in Hong Kong, ©\nbecause it was the place to which Snowden first fled after leav-\ning Hawaii. Snowden had planned the trip for at least four weeks,\naccording to the mandatory travel plan he had filed at the NSA.\nWhen I spoke to my sources in the intelligence community, they\ncould not explain Snowden’s choice. It would not necessarily protect\nhim from the reach of U.S. law, because Hong Kong had an active\nextradition treaty with the United States. Just a few months earlier,\nHong Kong had made headlines by honoring America’s request to\nextradite Trent Martin, a fugitive wanted for insider trading.\n\nNor was Hong Kong particularly convenient to Hawaii. There\nwere no nonstop flights there from Honolulu in May 2013. Snowden\nflew eight hours to Narita International Airport in Japan, where he\nwaited almost three hours. He then flew five hours to Hong Kong.\nSnowden could have flown to countries that do not have extradition\ntreaties with America in far less time.\n\nAdding to this mystery, at the time he departed Honolulu,\nSnowden had not yet arranged for any journalists to meet him in\nHong Kong, and as far as U.S. intelligence could determine, he had\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_rt.zindd 5 ® 929N6 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019493",
