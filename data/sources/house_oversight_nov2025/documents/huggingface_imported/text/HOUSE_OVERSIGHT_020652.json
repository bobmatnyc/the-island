  "text": "Dissenting Opinion\n\nSUSAN SHIRK\n\nAlthough I have no problem with the factual research that has gone into specific sections\nof the report, I respectfully dissent from what I see as the report’s overall inflated\nassessment of the current threat of Chinese influence seeking on the United States. The\nreport discusses a very broad range of Chinese activities, only some of which constitute\ncoercive, covert, or corrupt interference in American society and none of which actually\nundermines our democratic political institutions. Not distinguishing the legitimate from\nthe illegitimate activities detracts from the credibility of the report. The cumulative effect\nof this expansive inventory that blurs together legitimate with illegitimate activities is to\noverstate the threat that China today poses to the American way of life. Especially during\nthis moment in American political history, overstating the threat of subversion from\n\nChina risks causing overreactions reminiscent of the Cold War with the Soviet Union,\nincluding an anti-Chinese version of the Red Scare that would put all ethnic Chinese under\na cloud of suspicion. Right now, I believe the harm we could cause our society by our own\noverreactions actually is greater than that caused by Chinese influence seeking. That is why\nI feel I must dissent from the overall threat assessment of the report.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020652",
