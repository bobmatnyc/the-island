  "text": "purchase order. Our meetings were now no more than five minutes long.\n\nFrom this moment forward, resolve to keep those around you focused and avoid all meetings, whether\nin person or remote, that do not have clear objectives. It is possible to do this tactfully, but expect that\nsome time wasters will be offended the first few times their advances are rejected. Once it is clear that\nremaining on task is your policy and not subject to change, they will accept it and move on with life.\nHard feelings pass. Don’t suffer fools or you'll become one.\n\nIt is your job to train those around you to be effective and efficient. No one else will do it for you.\nHere are a few recommendations:\n\n1. Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following\nmeans of communication, in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meetings. If someone\nproposes a meeting, request an e-mail instead and then use the phone as your fallback offer if need be.\nCite other immediately pending work tasks as the reason.\n\n2. Respond to voicemail via e-mail whenever possible. This trains people to be concise. Help them\ndevelop the habit.\n\nSimilar to our opening greeting on the phone, e-mail communication should be streamlined to prevent\nneedless back-and-forth. Thus, an e-mail with “Can you meet at 4:00 P.M.?” would become “Can you\nmeet at 4:00 P.M.? If so If not, please advise three other times that work for you.”\n\nThis “if ... then” structure becomes more important as you check e-mail less often. Since I only check\ne-mail once a week, it is critical that no one needs a “what if?” answered or other information within\nseven days of a given e-mail I send. If I suspect that a manufacturing order hasn’t arrived at the shipping\nfacility, for example, [Il send an e-mail to my shipping facility manager along these lines: “Dear Susan\n... Has the new manufacturing shipment arrived? If so, please advise me on ... If not, please contact John\nDoe at 555-5555 or via e-mail at john@doe.com (he is also CC’d) and advise on delivery date and\ntracking. John, if there are any issues with the shipment, please coordinate with Susan, reachable at 555—\n4444, who has the authority to make decisions up to $500 on my behalf. In case of emergency, call me\non my cell phone, but I trust you two. Thanks.” This prevents most follow-up questions, avoids two\nseparate dialogues, and takes me out of the problem-solving equation.\n\nGet into the habit of considering what “if ... then” actions can be proposed in any e-mail where you\nask a question.\n\n3. Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a predefined situation, not to define the\nproblem. If someone proposes that you meet with them or “set a time to talk on the phone,” ask that\nperson to send you an e-mail with an agenda to define the purpose:\n\nThat sounds doable. So I can best prepare, can you please send me an e-mail with an agenda? That is,\nthe topics and questions we’ll need to address? That would be great. Thanks in advance.\n\nDon’t give them a chance to bail out. The “thanks in advance” before a retort increases your chances\nof getting the e-mail.\n\nThe e-mail medium forces people to define the desired outcome of a meeting or call. Nine times out\nof ten, a meeting is unnecessary and you can answer the questions, once defined, via e-mail. Impose this\nhabit on others. I haven’t had an in-person meeting for my business in more than five years and have had\nfewer than a dozen conference calls, all lasting less than 30 minutes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013859",
