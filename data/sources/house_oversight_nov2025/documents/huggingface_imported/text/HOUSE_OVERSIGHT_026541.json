  "text": "same cell; for details of calculations leading to payoffs, see appendix). This calculation\nis the result of the following logic: each time the temptation is low, player 1 cooperates\nand gets a, player 2 gets b, and the game continues with probability w until the first\ntime the temptation is high. We refer to the strategy where player 1 cooperates without\nlooking (top row) as CWOL. We also refer to the strategy pair where player 1 CWOLs\nand player 2 continues if player 1 CWOLs (first column) as CWOL. We refer to the\nstrategy pairs where player 1 cooperates with or without looking and player 2 continues\nif player 1 cooperates (first and second row, and middle middle column) as CWL. We\nrefer to the strategy pair where player 1 always defects and player 2 always exits (bottom\nrow and rightmost column) as ALLD. ALLD is always an equilibrium of the envelope\ngame. CWOL is an equilibrium if a/(1 — w) > qp+e¢,(1 — p). CWL is an equilibrium if\n\na/(1—w) > cp. This region is a subset of the region for which CWOL is an equilibrium.\nFigure 3: Learning Dynamics of the Envelope Game\n\nWe apply the replicator dynamic to the envelope game restricted to the strategies repre-\nsented in figure 2. The replicator dynamic describes strategies evolving over time under\nthe assumption that the rate of reproduction within each population is proportional to\nthe fitness relative to that type’s other strategies. The replicator dynamic also models\nlearning dynamics such as reinforcement learning or prestige-biased imitation. We run\n1000 time series with randomly seeded strategy frequencies for a range of values of a, and\nrecord the frequency with which they stabilize in one of the strategy pairs identified in\nfigure 2, or in a behaviorally equivalent equilibrium, as presented in the simplexes. We\nvary the value of a along the x-axis. The y-axis represents frequencies, and each colored\nline presents the frequency of the strategy pair. The parameter region where the strategy\n\npair is supported as an equilibrium is shaded in light red. CWOL is supported as an\n\nAl\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026541",
