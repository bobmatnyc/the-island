  "text": "Why is now a more important time than ever for a WE Talks?\n\n| believe the women movement to be one of the most fascinating phenomena of\nour times. The woman’s role has changed so much in modern society with more\nwomen taking leadership positions and starting their own companies. The modern\nwoman is wearing more hats than ever. In the 80-s, a successful woman was\nexpected to pursue an education and then to get married and raise children. Right\nnow, women are expected to have successful careers, be equal financial\ncontributors to the family, and yet maintain their traditional “feminine” roles,\nincluding taking care of the home, cooking, and raising kids.\n\nYet women with full-time jobs still earn only about 77 percent of their male\ncounterparts’ earnings. About four-in-ten employed women say they have\nexperienced some form of gender discrimination at work. There is also a serious\ngender gap in startup rates of men and women, where there are about seven\nwomen entrepreneurs for every ten men entrepreneurs. The statistics is pretty\ngloomy in both corporate and startup world. The share of female Fortune 500\nCEOs has dropped by 25% in 2018 to 5%. Female founders receive only 2% percent\nof the venture capital. Nevertheless, female-founded startups generate more\nrevenue and do it with less funding.\n\n| think networking a paramount to business and personal success. For ages, men\nhad men only clubs, including cigar clubs, university clubs, golf clubs etc. Even\nnowadays, male investors and intrapreneurs would go out for drinks and talk about\nbusiness. Women are starting to do it, but just don’t do it enough. Curated\nnetworking, right introductions, and a solid community would help narrow the\ngender gap.\n\nYou were a model, then ran a nonprofit, and now you've started WE Talks.\nWhere did you learn to have the courage to \"put yourself out there\" and take\nrisks again and again?\n\n| think risk taking is in my DNA. | grew up playing tennis competing on a Junior\nCircuit and simply couldn’t envision a predictable and “normal” life in Moscow. |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022268",
