  "text": "220 Teaching Minds\n\nwe keep trying to prevent this from happening with kids. Lots of TV,\nthat’s the ticket.\n\nMajor learning by-doing mechanism ignored: And last but not\nleast, scholars from Plato to Dewey have pointed that people learn\nby doing. That is how we learn. Doing. Got it? Apparently not. Very\nlittle doing in schools. Unless you count filling in circles with number\n2 pencils as doing.\n\nOnline education can change all this. Build it right once and children\nthe world over will have the opportunity to learn how to think and to\nlearn how to work. Such a system would be capable of changing fast.\nAny new industry or market or technology could produce a course in\nwhat is needed to work in that field and instantly get the people it\nneeded.\n\nSchools are an ancient artifact that can’t last much longer.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023966",
