  "text": "Jerry: Anyway, | might get this Stand-up Comedy Award tonight, and\nI' m_ trying to think of what to say that will sound completely\nspontaneous. So, Kramer, what’ s your current scheme?\n\nKramer: Okay, | got this idea because of the insurance companies.\nBlue Cross will pay for six Viagra pills a month. Well, that’ s very arbitrary,\nisn’ tit? | mean | get six hard-ons in one day.\n\nJerry: That’ s the national average, you know, six hard-ons a day.\n\nKramer: Jerry, believe me, Kramer don’ t have “average” hard-\nons. But here’ s my merchandising plan. It’ s for one-night stands—a\ncombination package of Viagra and RU486, the morning-after pill. It’ sa\nnatural for the unisex market.\n\n[Cut to the restaurant. Elaine and George are sitting at the table]\n\nElaine: But, George, that’ s stealing.\n\nGeorge: Yep. And from my own parents.\n\nElaine: You have no scruples. How do you know your father isn’ t\ncounting the number of times he “makes whoopee” with your mother?\nHe’ Il rea/ize that you took some of his Viagra pills when he thinks he has\nnine more times to go but the bottle has only five pills left?\n\nGeorge: You think he keeps a tally sheet? He’ II never even suspect.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015400",
