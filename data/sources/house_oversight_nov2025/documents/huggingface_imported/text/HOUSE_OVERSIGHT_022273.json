Net pay Scents. But 5d is a bit short for me.\n\n**For 35d expiry You could look at selling 91.50 (6usd OTM put) for S6cents and buying 103c (5.5usd OTM)\nfor 58cents or the 102c (4.5usd OTM) for 76cents.\n\nCL1 <comdty> OMON on Bloomberg has live strikes and bid/ask.\n\nIf 5d is too short and 35d is too long / not enough gamma, Tazia may be able to source liquidity from the\nstreet.
