  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nback to me in shock. “They don’t follow the Supreme Court in the United States,” he exclaimed.\n“Now that’s a subject worthy of study,” I replied.\n\nIt is important to remember that in a democracy, even a democracy in which the Supreme Court\nplays so central a role, that in the end the people decide. This is especially true in an area, like\nobscenity, where “community values” help define the law. Such values are ever-shifting and\nsubject to influence. While the Supreme Court has insisted that the government has the power to\npunish (and otherwise regulate) the showing and viewing of “obscene” films in adult-only theaters\n(and on cable and “on demand” television), the people have voted the other way with their feet\n(and their remotes). The law in action today bears little resemblance to Chief Justice Berger’s\n“categorical...disapprov[al] of [my] theory that obscene, pornographic films acquire\nconstitutional immunity from state regulation simply because they are exhibited for consenting\nadults only...” The law in action more closely resembles the approach I advocated in my first\nencounter with the law of obscenity back in 1969. I promised Judge Aldrich that if we lost in the\nSupreme Court, I would continue, as a lawyer, to continue to urge acceptance of the argument\nthat the government has no business telling a consenting adult what he may or may not watch in a\ntheater (or video or TV) from which children are excluded, so long as the “externalities” —that\nwhich appears in public view outside the theater—is not obscene.\n\nI have kept my promise, and despite the Supreme Court’s continued insistence—most recently in\nthe violent video games case—that “obscenity” is not protected by the First Amendment, porn is\nwidely available to consenting adults who choose to watch it without thrusting it upon unwilling\nviewers. That’s the law in action. Inevitably, the law, as articulated by the courts, will follow the\nlaw in action, lest it become irrelevantly anachronistic or patently hypocritical. Hypocrisy, it has\nbeen said, is the homage paid by vice to virtue. In the area of obscenity, hypocrisy functions to\nallow the courts to maintain a pretense of Puritanism in a world of prurience. A puritan, H.L.\nMenkin once remarked, is a person who spends his days worrying that somewhere, somehow,\nsomeone is having fun. T. B. Macaulay once observed that “The Puritan hated bear-baiting, not\nbecause it gave pain to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the spectators.” Perhaps that’s\nwhy our “Puritan” former Chief Justice insisted on comparing adult films to bear-baiting. Some\nadults enjoy watching obscene films. Although some puritans and feminists hate this, there is no\nevidence that this activity causes the type of harm that government should be empowered to\nprevent by censorship.*°\n\nMost Americans seem to understand that pornography, while offensive to some, is not provably\nharmful to others. That’s why obscenity prosecutions have a relatively low rate of success. I\nhave been involved in dozens of obscenity cases over the years and do not recall ever losing one.\nIn addition to litigating many obscenity cases, I have written extensively on the subject. My\narticle “Why Pornography?” set out to determine whether there is any actual relationship between\n“hard-core pornography” and violence against women. It began by disputing Justice Potter\nStewart’s famous line that although he could never “define” hard core pornography, “I know it\nwhen I see it.” That may have been true before radical feminists targeted pornography as a major\ncause of rape and other violence against women. Now the radical feminist definition of hard-core\npornography would be unrecognizable to Justice Stewart, as well as to social scientist who seek\n\n‘0 Even if there were evidence that it harmed the viewer, that would not be a good enough reason for banning it, so\nlong as there is no evidence it harms others.
