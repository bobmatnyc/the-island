One response that is often heard is a\nnote of cautious optimism, captured in US President Barack Obama\nrecent speech at the State Department when he referred to the\n“promise of the future.”\n\nBut sometimes we also hear the populist smears that have been\napplied to the Middle East for so long that nothing, it seems — no\namount of extraordinary change — can silence them. After the\nsuccessful revolts in Cairo and Tunis, the slanders abated. Soon,\nhowever, the old messages depicting the Middle East as extreme,\nfundamentalist, and hostile to democracy began to re-insinuate\nthemselves in the West.\n\nOn the other hand, ordinary men and women in the West seem to feel\nan instinctive sympathy toward their counterparts in the Middle East\nand North Africa, many of whom are paying the ultimate price in\nfighting for their rights. These sacrifices have convinced many\nWesterners that the Middle East is not beyond redemption, and that\nthe region’s people should be given a chance to enjoy the same\nliberty that they do.\n\nThis clash of perceptions has caught the world’s policy experts and\nanalysts off guard. That, too, is not surprising, because the situation\nremains an amorphous mix of hope and destruction.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030160",
