Although | believed then and\ncontinued to believe that AD was the person with whom | had sex, recent developments raise the possibility that this\nmay be a case of mistaken identification. \"\n\nAlternative:\n\n\"that it may have been someone else\".\n\n\"That someone mistakenly told me it was him.\"\n\nWe should be able to come up with a mutually acceptable statement. It would be acceptable if the statement came from\nyou rather than her, if she prefers.\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Dec 9, 2015, at 10:21 AM, Alan Dershowitz <dersh@law.harvard.edu> wrote:\n\nDavid\nHave we given up on a mutually acceptable statement from VR or you.
