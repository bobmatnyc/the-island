  "text": "In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a\npress campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy\nthan they are of legal threats):\n\n1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not\npublishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the\nquestionable nature of the book;\n\n2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson.\nConnolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair,\nhas refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine;\n\n3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book,\nand that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe\nPatterson's \"authorship\" of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an\nextension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--\neffectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
