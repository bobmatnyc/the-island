Einstein presumed sister photons\nwere like socks; they were emitted from the light source with their\npolarizations already set, though you could not see this information until\nyou measured one of the photons. The information was dubbed ‘hidder’\nand the theory is called hidden variable theory.\n\nEinstein was to be proven wrong.\n\nFor many years after the EPR paper was published, physicists\nsplit into factions: some thought the world random, some believed in\nhidden variables, and others thought attempts to ‘understand’ quantum\nmechanics were misguided. Why should physics make sense? The\nequations work. Who cares why?\n\nIn 1964, John Bell, an Irish physicist working at the Conseil\nEuropéen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (“CERN’), devised a way to test\nEinstein’s hidden variable theory. He pointed out that if photons possess\nhidden variables and we randomly measure them with a detector set at\nthree angles, we would expect to see more than one-third of the photons\nshare the same result. But, in 1972, Freedman and Clauser performed\nthis experiment and showed the photons share the result only a little over\na quarter of the time. Since ‘a little over a quarter’ is less than ‘more than\na third’, Bell’s theory is false. Of course, Bell was entirely happy about\nthis, since he set the equation up to be disproven. His equation is called\nan inequality because the equation contains a more than sign ‘>’ rather\nthan an equals ‘=’ sign, so people say that quantum mechanics violates\nthe Bell inequality. Because the inequality is violated, photons can have\nno prior knowledge of their polarization.\n\nBlue Light\nDetectors Detectors\na Red Red a\ni Photon Photon —\nPolarizer Polarizer\n\n————_—_——l\n\nCorrelater\n\nBell Test Experiment\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016023",
