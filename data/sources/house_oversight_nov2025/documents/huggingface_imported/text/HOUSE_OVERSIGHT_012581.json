  "text": "JAY P. LEFKOWITZ, Eso.\nDECEMBER 13, 2007\nPAGE 5 OF 5\n\nWith respect to Ms. Miller, I contacted her attorney - who was paid for by Mr. Epstein and\nwas directed by counsel for Mr. Epstein to demand immunity — and asked only whether he still\nrepresented Ms. Miller and if he wanted me to send the victim notification letter to him. He asked\nwhat the letter would say and I told him that the letter would be forthcoming in about a week and\nthat I could not provide him with the terms. With respect to Ms. Miller’s status as a victim, you\nagain want us to accept as true only facts that are beneficial to your client and to reject as false\nanything detrimental to him. Ms. Miller made a number of statements that are contradicted by\ndocumentary evidence and a review of her recorded statement shows her lack of credibility with\nrespect to anumber of statements. Based upon all of the evidence collected, Ms. Miller is classified\nas a victim as defined by statute. Of course, that does not mean that Ms. Miller considers herself\na victim or that she would seek damages from Mr. Epstein. I believe that a number of the identified\nvictims will not seek damages, but that does not negate their legal status as victims.\n\nI hope that you now understand that your accusations against myself and the agents are\nunfounded. In the future, I recommend that you address your accusations to me so that I can correct\nany misunderstandings before you make false allegations to others in the Department. I hope that\nwe can move forward with a professional resolution of this matter, whether that be by your client’s\nadherence to the contract that he signed, or by virtue of a trial.\n\nSincerely,\n\nR. Alexander Acosta\nUnited States Attorney\n\nBy: s/A. Marie Villafaria\nA. Marie Villafafia\nAssistant United States Attorney\n\ncc: — R. Alexander Acosta, U.S. Attorney\nJeffrey Sloman, First Assistant U.S. Attorney\n\nYou also accuse me of “broaden[ing] the scope of the investigation without any foundation\nfor doing so by adding charges of money laundering and violations of amoney transmitting business\nto the investigation.” Again, I consulted with the Justice Department’s Money Laundering Section\nabout my analysis before expanding that scope. The duty attorney agreed with my analysis.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012581",
