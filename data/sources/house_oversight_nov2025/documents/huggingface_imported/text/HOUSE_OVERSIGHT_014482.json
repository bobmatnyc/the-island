  "text": "Rotation trade — valuations have moved a long way\n\nWhile technical metrics suggest a pause is due in the reflation rotation, we have also\nseen a significant amount of ground covered from a valuation perspective in the market\nmoves to date.\n\nThe scatter chart below compares the PE relative change since 8th July (the post Brexit\nvaluation high / low for many sectors) against where PE relative ranks now compared to\nhistory. Essentially sectors in the top right have enjoyed a relative multiple re-rating and\ncurrent relative PE levels are above the median since 1999. Those in the bottom left\nhave seen relative PE multiples de-rate while their current relative PE is below the\nmedian since 1999. We make the following observations:\n\ne Financials have had the biggest re-rating. Financials re-rated most since\nBrexit and are now trading around median relative valuation levels. Given the\ntight link between relative valuations and bond yields in recent years the PE-\nrelatives for Banks and Insurance have also recovered much more than would\nseem justified by the move in the German 10-year yield. The sectors do screen\ncheaper versus history on PBV reflecting relatively depressed ROEs especially\nfor Banks. Hence, we think PE multiple expansion from here would need to be\ndriven by improving EPS prospects in the sector — something our analysts are\n\nsceptical about.\n\n¢ Global Cyclicals trading near or below average relative PE’s. Many global\ncyclicals have had fairly modest re-ratings since early July and trade on close to\nmedian or below valuations. Sectors such as Industrials, Chemicals, Autos, Tech\nhave relative PE multiples 5-10% higher than post Brexit. Relative PE for\nChemicals and Industrials are close to post 1999 averages. Construction PE\nrelative does screen as elevated — at the 92\"? percentile. Autos, Tech and Travel\n& Leisure all have PE relatives in the bottom quartile of their post 1999 range.\nRelative PE valuations look very reasonable on this basis for Tech, Chemicals\nand even industrials. In part this may reflect higher than historical average ROE\n— relative PBV is less flattering for Industrials for example.\n\ne Resources sectors — de-rating as EPS recovers. Oil and Basic Resources PE\nrelative has declined more than in any other sector. Although both sectors have\nseen strong price performance this year, PE multiples are declining from very\nelevated levels earlier this year as earnings bounce back from depressed levels.\nSince the end of June Basics 12m forward EPS is up +65%, while the sector\nindex price has risen +33%. For Basics and Oil, performance from here is likely\nto remain a function of EPS momentum rather than valuations.\n\ne Defensives have all de-rated with Telecoms suffering least. Defensive\nsectors have all seen relative valuations decline over the past four months.\nHealthcare and Utilities are the two sectors with multiples at lower end of the\nhistorical range — notably Healthcare at the 14 percentile. Utilities relative PE\nis also close to the prior low hit in 2013. Telecoms screens as somewhat less\ndepressed form a valuation perspective — notwithstanding the poor sector\nperformance in 2016. PE relative remains well above the median levels since\n1999.\n\ne Staples approaching 2010/14 lows on PE-relative. Staples have also de-\nrated severely — in fact Food & Beverage relative PE fell somewhat more than\nthe other Defensives. However, current levels are still somewhat higher versus\nthe historical range (since 1999) than for Healthcare or Utilities. That being\nsaid, the PE-relative rose structurally through the 2000s. Over a shorter time\nframe since 2010 Food & Beverage is also now trading near the bottom\nquartile. PE-relative is 6-10% above the lows seen in 2010 and 2014 — but\nthose would still allow for healthy 25-30% valuation premiums to the market .\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch European Equity Strategy |O1 December 2016 23\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014482",
