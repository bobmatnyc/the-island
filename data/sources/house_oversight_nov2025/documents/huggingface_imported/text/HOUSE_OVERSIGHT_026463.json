But blurring those boundaries ultimately\nmakes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work.\" Comey has also\nacknowledged that the president had the constitutional authority to fire him for any or no cause.\n\nPresident Trump also had the constitutional authority to order Comey to end the investigation of former national\nsecurity adviser Mike Flynn. He could have pardoned Flynn, as Bush pardoned Weinberger, thus ending the\nFlynn investigation, as Bush ended the Iran-Contra investigation. What Trump could not do is what Nixon did:\ndirect his aides to lie to the FBI, or commit other independent crimes. There is no evidence that Trump did that.\n\nOn Sat, Dec 2, 2017 at 10:00 AM, Larry Summers {> wrote:\n\nLater\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nPlease direct all scheduling inquiries to my office a\n\nFollow me on twitter @lhsummers\nwww.larrysummers.com\n\nOn Dec 2, 2017, at 9:50 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nOn Sat, Dec 2, 2017 at 9:30 AM, Larry Summers <_EE wrote:\n\nI don’t know whether to laugh or cry\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nPlease direct all scheduling inquiries to my office at: Pe\n\nFollow me on twitter @lhsummers\nwww.larrysummers.com\n\nOn Dec 2, 2017, at 9:29 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nlike the hunt for easter eggs. your friend andrew has so far only found one . and it was brighly colored :)\n\nOn Sat, Dec 2, 2017 at 9:23 AM, Larry Summers <q wrote:\n\n222?\nSent from my iPhone\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026463",
