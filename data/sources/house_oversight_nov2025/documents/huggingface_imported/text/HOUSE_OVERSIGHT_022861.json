  "text": "a settlement.)\n\nIt is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers then in\nEpstein’s case.\n\nEdwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton, Donald\nTrump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly from the\noriginal Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about Epstein.\n\nIn addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to\nEpstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton takes on a\nnew role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or imagined, to Epstein and\nsex Slaves.\n\nAlmost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is approached by\nother media seeking to write about Epstein, often with financial incentives offered\nin exchange for a tale.\n\nNo new stories or even new details emerge. Every aspect of the current story\nis based on court filings describing events that may or may not have taken place\nprior to 2007. It’s as though a kind of ground-hog day of moral opprobrium, a\ndesire to repeat and to savor a new the old details.\n\nA recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not given money\nto in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would give it back.\n\nThe world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure walls\nand the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms ever more incredulous\nand apoplectic that Epstein not only appears free but prospers too. Although he\nhas spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may be as much as $20\nmillion, he yet seems somehow to have not been sufficiently punished—that worst\nsin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute badness: the financier\nwhose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather than hard work; a rich\nmiddle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and entitlement, but has a\nPeter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a correct and prudish\nworld—someone who somehow didn’t get the memo about vast changes in mores\nand culture.\n\nWhen I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus would\nbe to get married, he said he’d rather go back to jail.\n\nHe is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.\n\nThis is all, of course, a Gatsby-like tale: An enigmatic, and strangely\nappealing figure, able to invent and inhabit his own world is a mystery to try to\ndecipher. Of course Gatsby in New York Post and Daily Mail parlance would\nlikely be just a freaky financier too.\n\nAnd this story is, in its way, about the limitation of journalism, in which the\nmost compelling parts of the tale—Epstein’s ambitions and impulses would be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022861",
