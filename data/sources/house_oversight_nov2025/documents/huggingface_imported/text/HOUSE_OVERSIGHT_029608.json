BROWN\nMiarni Herald\n\nMIAMI — A judge ruled Thursday\nthat federal prosecutors among\nthem, U.S, Labor Secretary Alexan-\nder Acosta — broke federal law when\nthey signed a plea agreement with a\nwealthy, politically connected sex traf-\nficker and concealed it from more than\n40) of his underage victims,\n\nU.S. District Judge Kenneth A.\nMarr, ina 33-page opinion, said the\nevidence he reviewed showed that Jef-\nfrey Epstein had been operating an in-\nternational sex operation in which he\nand others recruited underage girls\nnot only in Florida — but from over-\nseas, in Violation of federal law.\n\n“Epstein used paicl employees to\nfind and bring minor girls to him,”\nwrote Marra, who is based in Palm\nBeach County. “Epstein worked in\nconcert with others to obtain minors\nnot only for his own sexual gratifica-\ntion, but also for the sexual gratifica-\ntion of others.”\n\nInstead’ of prosecuting Epstein\nunder federal sex trafficking laws,\nAcosta, then the U.S. attorney in Mi-\nami, helped negotiate a nonprosecu-\ntion agreement that gave Epstein and\nhis co-conspirators immunity from\nfederal prosecution, Epstein, who\n\nvy ASSOCIATED PRESS\nJetfray Epstein, second frorn left, in\ncustody in West Palm Beach, Fla., in\n2008.\n\nlived in a Palm Beach mansion, was\nallowed to quietly plead guilty in state\ncourt to two prostitution changes and\nserved just 13 months in the county\njail. His accomplices, some of whom\nhave never been identified, were never\ncharged.\n\nAcosta agreed to seal the deal, which\nmeant that none of Epstein’s victims,\nwho were mostly 13 to 16 years old at\nthe time of the abuse, were told about\nit until it was too late for them to ap-\n\nWSTX FM 100 PRESENTS\n\npear at his sentencing and possibly\nreject the deal, Upon leaming that Ep\nstein had pleaded guilty without their\nknowledge, two of his victims filed a\nlawsuit in the Southern District of F lor-\nida in 2008, claiming that prosecutors\nviolated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,\nwhich grants victims of federal crimes\na series of rights, including the ability\nto confer with prosecutors about a pos-\nsible plea deal.\n\nMarra agreec, saying that while\nprosecutors had the right to resolve the\ncase in any way they saw fit, they vio\nlated the law by hiding the agreement\nfrom Epstein’s victims, Marra’s deci-\nsion capped Il years of litigation\n\nwhich included the release of a trove of\n\nemails showing how Acosta and other\nprosecutors worked with Epstein’s high\nprofile lawyers to conceal the deal\nand the scope of Epstein’s crimes\nfrom both his victims and the public,\n\n‘Particularly problematic was the\nGovernment's decision to conceal the\nexistence of the (agreement) and mis-\nlead the victims to believe that feder-\nal prosecution was still a possibility,”\nMarra wrote.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's office in Miami\ndeclined to comment,\n\nIn addition to Palm Beach, Fla.,\nEpstein also has a home in New York\nand, lives on Little St. James Island\n\noff St. Thomas,\n\nBrad Edwards, the Port Lauderdale\nattorney who brought the case, said\nhe was elated at the judge's ruling,\nbut admitted he is bitter that the case\ntook 11 years to litigate, blaming fed-\neral prosecutors for needlessly drag-\nging out the case when they could\nhave remedied their error when it was\nbrought to their attention in 2008,\n\nWhile the victims ultimately would\nlike to see Epstein go to jail, the\njudge's ruling stopped short of issu-\ning aremedy or punishment, He gave\nthe government and victims 15 days\nto confer with each other to come up\nwith a resolution. [ts unclear what\nthat resolution would be,\n\nEdwards conceded that Epstein’s\nsentence isn’t likely to be overturned.\nHe was released in 2009,\n\nBut victims’ rights advocates say\nthat other charges can still be brought\nagainst Epstein if more victims come\nforward in other jurisdictions. There\nhas been no statute of limitations for\nsex trafficking since 2002.\n\nThe decision follows a three-part\nseries published by the Miami Herald\nin November, “Perversion of Justice,”\nwhich detailed how federal prosecu-\ntors worked in concert with Epstein’s\nlawyers to arrange the deal.\n\nSince then, the U.S, Department\nof Justice has launched a probe into\nwhether federal prosecutors commit-\nted any wrongdoing,\n\nFriday, February 22, 2019\n\nGov.
