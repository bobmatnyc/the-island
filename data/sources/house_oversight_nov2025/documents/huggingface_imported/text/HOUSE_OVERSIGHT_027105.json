  "text": "Obama has done everything right, and yet his Iran policy is failing. There\nis no evidence that the sanctions will bring Iran to its knees and force the\nsupreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to accept the humiliation of\nabandoning his nuclear program. But neither is there any sign of new\nthinking in the White House. \"I don't see how what didn't work last year is\ngoing to work this year,\" says Vali Nasr, who served in the Obama State\nDepartment before becoming dean of the Johns Hopkins School of\nAdvanced International Studies. He might not get much of an argument\nfrom White House officials, who, the New York Times recently noted,\n\"seem content with stalemate.\"\n\nThe United States is not negotiating directly with Iran but rather doing so\nthrough the P5+1, which consists of the five permanent Security Council\nmembers and Germany. The P5+1's current position is that Iran must stop\nenriching nuclear fuel to 20 percent purity -- a point from which Iran\ncould quickly move to weapons-grade material -- transfer its existing stock\nof such fuel to a third country, and shut down one of its two enrichment\nfacilities, known as Fordow. In exchange, the parties will help Iran\nproduce such fuel for medical purposes, which the regime claims is its\nactual goal. Iran has refused, saying it will not shut down Fordow.\n\nBut the current state of play masks the larger issue, which is that the\nayatollah and those around him believe the United States wants to make\nIran cry uncle -- which happens to be true. The next round of P5+1\nnegotiations, now scheduled for Feb. 25 in Kazakhstan, are almost\ncertainly not going to go anywhere unless the United States signals that it\nis prepared to make what the Iranians view as meaningful and equivalent\nmoves in exchange for Iranian concessions. Arms-control experts say that\nboth British Prime Minister David Cameron and Catherine Ashton, head\nof foreign affairs for the European Union, favor offering Iran a reduction\nin sanctions; but there's a limit to what they can do without the United\nStates.\n\nOf course, such flexibility would be pointless if Iran 1s simply hell-bent on\ngaining the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon. The signals, as always\nwith Iran, are cryptic. Iranian authorities have told nuclear inspectors that\nthey plan to install a new generation of centrifuges in order to accelerate\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027105",
