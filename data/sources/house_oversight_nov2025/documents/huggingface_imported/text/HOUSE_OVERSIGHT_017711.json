The new rule is an\nimprovement, in that it limits ex parte procedures to \"exceptional circumstances.\" The Committee note then offers two\n\nillustrations of exceptional circumstances. One is unobjectionable - where \"evidence ... might be lost or destroyed if the\n590\n\n\"\n\nsubpoena were delayed\" - a standard exigent circumstance that justifies moving rapidly. But the other illustration -\n\nn 591\n\na\n\nsituation where the defense would be unfairly prejudiced by premature disclosure of a sensitive defense strategy - remains\n\nquite problematic, for reasons discussed earlier. °?7\nRule 21. Also at its October 1, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee approved a very modest change to Rule 21(b), regarding\ntransfer of cases for convenience. The change reads:\n\nRule 21. Transfer for Trial\n\n(b) For Convenience. Upon the defendant's motion, the court may transfer the proceeding, or one or more counts, against that\ndefendant to another district for the convenience of the parties, and victim, and the witnesses, and in the interests of justice.\n\nThis change is modest, because (in my estimation) relatively few federal cases involving victims are transferred for\n\"convenience\" under Rule 21(b). The more common situation is transfers for prejudice under Rule 21(a). >°3 Thus, this change\nis, at best, relatively inconsequential.\n\nIn any event, the change is defective. While the proposed rule lets the judge consider the victim's interest in determining\nwhether to transfer, the Advisory Committee did not adopt my recommendation to let crime victims be heard on transfer\ndecisions. °?4 Without a mechanism for passing victim information along to the judge, an instruction to the judge to consider\nthe victims' interest is essentially meaningless. The Advisory Committee should remedy this defect by giving victims the right\nto be heard on transfer decisions.\n\nRule 32. In possible response to my point that victims deserve the right to be \"heard\" at sentencing hearings by speaking\ndirectly to the judge, *°° on April 16, 2007, the Advisory Committee modified its note to Rule 32(i)(4). The note now reads:\n\"Absent unusual circumstances, any victim who is present should be [*969] allowed a reasonable opportunity to speak\ndirectly to the judge.\" *°° While this is an improvement over earlier language, it still remains unclear what sorts of \"unusual\ncircumstances\" the Advisory Committee has in mind that would permit a judge to deny a victim her right under the CVRA to\nspeak. It is also odd that the Advisory Committee Note would apparently allow a judge to exclude a victim in some\n\ncircumstances, when the only two reported decisions on the issue have held directly to the contrary that victims have an\n\nunequivocal right to speak to the judge. *°7\n\nRule 60. In response to public comments, the Advisory Committee made several modest changes to Rule 60. Rule 60(a)(2) was\nrevised to make clear that the duty to permit full attendance arises in the context of the victim's possible exclusion. *?° As\n\n589 See supra notes 347-351 and accompanying text.\n\n59° Bucklew Memo, supra note 580, app. a, at 282.\n\n591 Tq.\n\n592 See supra notes 249-257 and accompanying text.\n\n593 See, e.g., supra notes 366-382 and accompanying text (discussing transfer for prejudice in two cases).\n594 See supra note 366 and accompanying text.\n\n95 See supra notes 434-448 and accompanying text.\n\n96 Beale Memo, supra note 580, app. at 7.\n\n597 See Kenna v.
