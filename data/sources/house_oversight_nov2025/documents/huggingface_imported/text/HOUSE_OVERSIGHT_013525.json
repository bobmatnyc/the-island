  "text": "of possible mouse travels is occupied. All the action is centered on a small set of\npoints. When such a minimal entropy person is injured and feeling helpless, their\nstuckness can grow bizarre. Ruminative fixation in self-critical and persecutory\nideas extend into poisoned food anorexia, circular pacing, weight loss and middle-\nof-the-night, worried insomnia. Suffused with sin, they ask forgiveness for soiling the\nchair by their sitting in it or smelling up the room with their body odor.\n\nAt the high entropic extreme, the mouse orbits of the seductively dramatic,\nnew reality-creating hysteric includes big jumps, disorganized whorls and large and\nsmall restless and short attention span scribbles that tend to fill up the entire screen.\nThe fragility of fixation at this end manifests itself in breakdown into impulsively out-\nof-control and floridly dramatic displays. Their decrease in contact with reality\nprecipitates social chaos around them. The Montreal behavioral neurologist, Pierre\nFlor-Henry, using electroencephalographic and psychological test data, described\nthe difference between these two extreme forms of personality expressions as the\noverly dominant expressions of one or another of the /eft obsessional or right\nhysteric hemispheric emotional styles. As examples, Flor-Henry said that a left half\nbrain depression feels like hopeless and agitated indecision and the depression of\nthe right brain is an experience of emptiness like homesickness. Left-brain\nhappiness is being exactly correct and right brain joy rushes like being especially\nchosen.\n\nThe church going obsessional resonates with the sermon of the punitive\npriest who invokes the tension and relief of sin and salvation. The practice can\nresult in a life long addiction to the transient high of this temporary forgiveness. In\nother churches, the hysterical character gets spiritual respite in disassociative\nvisitations of the Holy Ghost and attendant signs and wonders. At Wednesday night\nhealing services, new hope arises from personal surrender in a floor hitting,\nbackward collapse called dying in the Lord. Both of these antipodal personalities\ncontrast with the more receptive state of in-between entropy (with enough entropy\navailable to form messages) which predicts more flexibility and higher potential for\nundistorted information processing. Relatively style-less and ego-less people are\n\nmore open to hearing a variety of Gods in themselves and others. High alertness\n\n25\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013525",
