  "text": "CHAPTER 24\nOff to Moscow\n\nThey talk about Russia like it’s the worst place on earth. Russia’s\ngreat.\n\n—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2015\n\nEFORE FLYING TO Moscow, I arranged to have dinner with\n\nOliver Stone at an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side of\nNew York. I had greatly respected Stone’s ability as a film director\nafter watching him work on Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, a film\nin which I had a cameo role. I had also debated Stone about the his-\ntorical accuracy of his 1991 movie JFK at Town Hall in New York.\n\nWhen we dined, he had just written, produced, and directed\nSnowden, an independently financed film depicting Snowden, as\nStone put it, as “one of the great heroes of the twenty-first century.”\nIn preparing for it, Stone had seen Snowden in 2013 and 2014 and\nhad had a six-hour meeting with Putin.\n\nI wanted to talk to Stone not to learn about the film but to learn\nhow he had gained access to Snowden in Moscow. I knew from the\ndocuments taken from Sony Pictures Entertainment—allegedly by\nNorth Korea—that Stone had paid The Guardian $700,000 for the\nfilm rights to The Snowden Files, a book written by Luke Harding.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 251 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019739",
