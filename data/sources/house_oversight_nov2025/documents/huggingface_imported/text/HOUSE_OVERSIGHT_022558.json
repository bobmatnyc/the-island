  "text": "e the appropriateness of a cooperation credit in light\n\nof the profile of the cooperating individual.\n\nCorporate Compliance Program\n\nIna global marketplace, an effective compliance pro-\ngram is a critical component of a company’s internal con-\ntrols and is essential to detecting and preventing FCPA vio-\nlations.*” Effective compliance programs are tailored to the\ncompany’s specific business and to the risks associated with\nthat business. They are dynamic and evolve as the business\nand the markets change.\n\nAn effective compliance program promotes “an orga-\nnizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a\ncommitment to compliance with the law.’*! Such a program\nprotects a company’s reputation, ensures investor value and\nconfidence, reduces uncertainty in business transactions, and\nsecures a company’s assets.’ A well-constructed, thought-\nfully implemented, and consistently enforced compliance\nand ethics program helps prevent, detect, remediate, and\nreport misconduct, including FCPA violations.\n\nIn addition to considering whether a company has\nself-reported, cooperated, and taken appropriate remedial\nactions, DOJ and SEC also consider the adequacy of a\ncompany’s compliance program when deciding what, if any,\naction to take. The program may influence whether or not\ncharges should be resolved through a deferred prosecution\nagreement (DPA) or non-prosecution agreement (NPA),\nas well as the appropriate length of any DPA or NPA, or\nthe term of corporate probation. It will often affect the\npenalty amount and the need for a monitor or self-report-\ning As discussed above, SEC’s Seaboard Report focuses,\namong other things, on a company’s self-policing prior to\nthe discovery of the misconduct, including whether it had\nestablished effective compliance procedures2™ Likewise,\nthree of the nine factors set forth in DOJ’s Principles of\nFederal Prosecution of Business Organizations relate, either\ndirectly or indirectly, to a compliance program’s design and\nimplementation, including the pervasiveness of wrongdo-\ning within the company, the existence and effectiveness of\nthe company’s pre-existing compliance program, and the\n\ncompany’s remedial actions?” DOJ also considers the US.\n\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\n\nSentencing Guidelines’ elements of an effective compliance\nprogram, as set forth in § 8B2.1 of the Guidelines.\n\nThese considerations reflect the recognition that\na company’s failure to prevent every single violation does\nnot necessarily mean that a particular company’s compli-\nance program was not generally effective. DOJ and SEC\nunderstand that “no compliance program can ever prevent\nall criminal activity by a corporation’s employees;?% and\nthey do not hold companies to a standard of perfection. An\nassessment of a company’s compliance program, including\nits design and good faith implementation and enforcement,\nis an important part of the government’s assessment of\nwhether a violation occurred, and if so, what action should\nbe taken. In appropriate circumstances, DOJ and SEC may\ndecline to pursue charges against a company based on the\ncompany’s effective compliance program, or may otherwise\nseek to reward a company for its program, even when that\nprogram did not prevent the particular underlying FCPA\nviolation that gave rise to the investigation”\n\nDOJ and SEC have no formulaic requirements\nregarding compliance programs. Rather, they employ a\ncommon-sense and pragmatic approach to evaluating com-\npliance programs, making inquiries related to three basic\nquestions:\n\ne Is the company’s compliance program well\ndesigned?\n\ne Is it being applied in good faith?\n\n¢ Does it work?”\n\nThis guide contains information regarding some of\nthe basic elements DOJ and SEC consider when evaluating\ncompliance programs. Although the focus is on compliance\nwith the FCPA, given the existence of anti-corruption\nlaws in many other countries, businesses should consider\ndesigning programs focused on anti-corruption compli-\n\nance more broadly”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022558",
