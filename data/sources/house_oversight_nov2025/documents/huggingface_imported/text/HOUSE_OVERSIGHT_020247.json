Poitras also\nasked the hacktavist Jacob Appelbaum to help her interview Snowden about the NSA’s\noperations. She later said that she needed someone with technical expertise in government\nsurveillance to test the bona fides of Citizen 4. She believed that Appelbaum, who had\nparticipated in her anti-NSA presentations in 2012, qualified for the position.\n\nAs it turns out, Appelbaum was already known to Snowden. Appelbaum had communicated\nwith Snowden under his Oahu Crypto party alias about an obscure piece of software just a few\nafter Snowden had met with Runa Sandvik in Hawaii in 2012. Appelbaum, after all, was\nSandvik’s long-time ally in developing the use of TOR software. However he learned about him,\nSnowden allowed Appelbaum to put to him detailed questions to concerning the secret operations\nof the NSA before he met with Poitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong. Indeed, Poitras joined him\nin asking Snowden via encrypted emails, such questions as: “What are some of the big\nsurveillance programs that are active today and how do international partners aid the NSA?”\n“Does the NSA partner with other nations, like Israel?” and “Do private companies help the\nNSA?” Snowden answered them all to the satisfaction of Appelbaum and Poitras. (The interview\nwas published on June16, 2013 with Snowden’s approval on the website of Der Spiegel, the\nGerman weekly, which had also published the Wikileaks documents.)\n\nEven though the days were ticking away while Snowden was waiting for him in Hong Kong,\nGreenwald still had to overcome a final hurdle at the Guardian. He needed to get a green light to\ngo to Hong Kong from Janine Gibson, the editor of the Guardian website, who was based in New\nYork. Under Gibson’s leadership, the Guardian's website effectively “gone into the business of\npublishing government secrets,” as Guardian columnist Michael Wolff pointed out. Most of\nthese secrets had been supplied by Manning via Wikileaks. Few, if any of these previous\ndocuments the Guardian published were highly-classified and none were SCI top secret\ndocuments. The NSA documents Greenwald had received from Citizen 4 were another matter.\nThey contained the sort of SCI communications intelligence data that no major newspaper had\never published before. Their disclosure could even result in journalists being imprisoned since\nboth U.S. and British law criminalized the disclosure by anyone of communications intelligence.\nAs a lawyer, Greenwald recognized this danger. On the other hand, the NSA documents were far\nmore explosive than the Wikileaks material, and promised an even greater spike in circulation. So\nGreenwald assumed that Gibson would be willing to authorize the publication of the\ndocuments—and provide the expenses for his trip to Hong Kong to meet the source.\n\nHe flew from Rio to New York on May 30, 2013 to meet in person with Gibson, who had\nconcerns about publishing what purported to be top secret documents that came from an\nanonymous source. For one thing, she was also not willing to go along with Citizen 4’s demand\nthat the Guardian publish his personal manifesto alongside the documents. Aside from its shrill\nand alarming tone, it sounded, as she told Greenwald, “a bit Ted Kaczynski-ish.” She was\nreferring to Ted Kaczinski, the deranged mathematician who had maimed or killed 23 people with\nanonymous mail bombs between 1978 and 1995. Like Citizen 4/Snowden, Kaczynski had\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020247",
