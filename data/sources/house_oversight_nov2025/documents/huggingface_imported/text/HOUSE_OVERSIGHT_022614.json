For example, in one instance, a Kazakh\nimmigration prosecutor threatened to fine, jail, or deport employees\n\nofa US. company’s subsidiary. Believing the threats to be genuine, the\nemployees in Kazakhstan sought guidance from senior management\n\nof the US. subsidiary and were authorized to make the payments. The\nemployees then paid the government official a total of $45,000 using\npersonal funds. The subsidiary reimbursed the employees, but it falsely\nrecorded the reimbursements as “salary advances” or “visa fines.” The\nparent company, which eventually discovered these payments, as well\n\nas other improperly booked cash payments made to a Kazakhstani\nconsultant to obtain visas, was charged with civil violations of the\naccounting provisions.
