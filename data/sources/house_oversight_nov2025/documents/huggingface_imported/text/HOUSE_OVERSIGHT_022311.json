  "text": "54040\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nprovision, it did not include two\nadditional provisions that the Board\ndeclared were necessary to prevent\n“unlawful encouragement of union\nmembership.” The Court disagreed,\nstating\n\nPerhaps the conditions which the Board\nattaches to hiring-hall arrangements will in\ntime appeal to the Congress. Yet, where\nCongress has adopted a selective system for\ndealing with evils, the Board is confined to\nthat system. National Labor Relations Board\nv. Drivers, etc. Local Union, 362 U.S. 274,\n284-290, 80 S.Ct. 706, 712-715, 4 L.Ed.2d\n710. Where, as here, Congress has aimed its\nsanctions only at specific discriminatory\npractices, the Board cannot go farther and\nestablish a broader, more pervasive\nregulatory scheme.182\n\nCongress in Section 8(a)(1) aimed its\nsanctions only at employer actions that\ninterfere with the exercise of Section 7\nrights. By this rulemaking, my\ncolleagues go farther and establish a\nbroader, more pervasive regulatory\nscheme that targets employer inaction,\nor silence, as unlawful interference. As\nLocal 357 instructs, they lack the\nauthority to do this.183\n\nAmerican Hospital Association v.\nNLRB, 499 U.S. 606 (1991) (AHA), upon\nwhich the majority heavily relies,\nillustrates a valid exercise of authority\nunder Section 6. In AHA, the Supreme\nCourt unanimously upheld the Board’s\nhealth care unit rule, finding that\nSection 6’s general grant of rulemaking\nauthority “was unquestionably\nsufficient to authorize the rule at issue\nin this case unless limited by some\nother provision in the Act.” Id. at 609-\n10 (emphasis added). The Court further\nfound that the rule was clearly\nconsistent with authority under Section\n9(b) to make appropriate bargaining unit\ndeterminations. It specifically rejected\nthe argument that language in 9(b)\ndirecting the Board to decide the\nappropriate bargaining unit “in each\ncase”’ limited its authority to define\nappropriate units by rulemaking.\n\nCongress expressly authorized the\nBoard in Section 9(b) to determine\nappropriate bargaining units and the\nBoard exercised its rulemaking\nauthority to promulgate a rule\n“necessary to carry out’ Section 9(b). In\ncontrast, as previously stated, there is\nno reasonable basis for finding that a\nrule making it unlawful for employers to\nfail to post and maintain a notice of\nemployee rights and selected illustrative\n\n182 365 U.S. at 676.\n\n183 My colleagues attempt to distinguish Local\n357 as limited to an interpretation of Sec. 8(a)(3)\nand 8(b)(2)’s prohibition of discriminatory\npractices. That may have been the issue before the\nCourt, but I do not view the quoted rationale as so\nlimited.\n\nunfair labor practices is necessary to\ncarry out any substantive section of the\nNLRA. Nevertheless, the majority\nconstrues AHA as an endorsement of\ndeference to the exercise of Section 6\nrulemaking authority whenever\nCongress did not expressly limit this\nauthority. This is patently incorrect. “To\nsuggest, as the [majority] effectively\ndoes, that Chevron deference is required\nany time a statute does not expressly\nnegate the existence of a claimed\nadministrative power * * *, is both\nflatly unfaithful to the principles of\nadministrative law * * * and refuted by\nprecedent.” Railway Labor Executives’\nAss’nv. National Mediation Bd., 29\nF.3d 655, 671 (D.C.Cir.1994) (citation\nomitted). Were courts “‘to presume a\ndelegation of power absent an express\nwithholding of such power, agencies\nwould enjoy virtually limitless\nhegemony, a result plainly out of\nkeeping with Chevron and quite likely\nwith the Constitution as well.” Id.\n\nIn sum, the majority’s notice rule does\nnot address a gap that Congress\ndelegated authority to the Board to fill,\nwhether by rulemaking or adjudication.\nThe Supreme Court has made clear that\n“Tw]here Congress has in the statute\ngiven the Board a question to answer,\nthe courts will give respect to that\nanswer; but they must be sure the\nquestion has been asked.’’ NLRB v.\nInsurance Agents’ Int’] Union, 361 U.S.\n419, 432-433 (1960). The Supreme\nCourt also has made clear: ‘‘[Congress]\ndoes not * * * hide elephants in\nmouseholes.” Whitman v. American\nTrucking Associations, 531 U.S. 457,\n468 (2001).\n\nMy colleagues’ action here is\nmarkedly like the Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC) regulation rejected as\nultra vires by the court of appeals in\nAm. Bar Ass’n v. FTC, supra. The FTC\nissued a ruling that attorneys engaged in\ncertain practices were financial\ninstitutions subject to the privacy\nprovision of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct (GBLA). Upon review of the\ndetailed statutory scheme at issue, the\ncourt found it ‘difficult to believe that\nCongress, by any remaining ambiguity,\nintended to undertake the regulation [of\na subject] * * * and never mentioned\n[it] in the statute.” 430 F.3d at 469. The\ncourt further opined that to find the\nFTC’s interpretation to be ‘‘deference-\nworthy, we would have to conclude that\nCongress not only had hidden a rather\nlarge elephant in a rather obscure\nmousehole, but had buried the\nambiguity in which the pachyderm\nlurks beneath an incredibly deep mound\nof specificity, none of which bears the\nfootprints of the beast or any indication\nthat Congress even suspected its\n\npresence.” Id. No such conclusion was\npossible in that case. No such\nconclusion is possible here. Quite\nsimply, the Board lacks statutory\nauthority to promulgate a rule that\nimposes a new obligation on employers\nand creates a new unfair labor practice\nto enforce it.\n\nThe Rule Is Arbitrary and Capricious\n\nEven if the Board arguably has\nrulemaking authority in this area,\ndeference is unwarranted under\nChevron and the Administrative\nProcedure Act if the rule promulgated is\n“arbitrary or capricious in substance, or\nmanifestly contrary to the statute.”\nUnited States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S.\n218, 227 (2001). Also see AHA, 499 U.S.\nat 618-20 (applying arbitrary and\ncapricious standard in its consideration\nof the Board’s rule on acute care\nhospital bargaining units). “Normally,\nan agency rule would be arbitrary and\ncapricious if the agency has relied on\nfactors which Congress has not intended\nit to consider, entirely failed to consider\nan important aspect of the problem,\noffered an explanation for its decision\nthat runs counter to the evidence before\nthe agency, or is so implausible that it\ncould not be ascribed to a difference in\nview or the product of agency\nexpertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfg. Ass’n of\nthe U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.\nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). “[Tlhe\nagency must examine the relevant data\nand articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor its action including a ‘rational\nconnection between the facts found and\nthe choice made.’ ”’ Id. (quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). See also\nBusiness Roundtable et al. v. S.E.C.,—\nF.3d—, 2011 WL 2936808 (D.C. Cir.,\nJuly 22, 2011) (finding SEC acted\narbitrarily and capriciously by relying\non insufficient empirical data\nsupporting its rule and by completely\ndiscounting contrary studies).\n\nIn AHA, the Board’s health care\nbargaining units rule was supported by\n“the extensive record developed during\nthe rulemaking proceedings, as well as\nits experience in the adjudication of\nhealth care cases during the 13-year\nperiod between the enactment of the\nhealth care amendments and its notice\nof proposed rulemaking.’’ AHA, 499\nU.S. at 618. The Supreme Court upheld\nthe validity of the rule finding it ‘“‘based\non substantial evidence and supported\nby a ‘reasoned analysis.” Id. at 619\n(citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass., 463\nU.S. at 57).\n\nBy contrast, the majority’s articulation\nof the need to mandate that employers\nviolate Section 8(a)(1) unless they post\na notice of employee rights is not based\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022311",
