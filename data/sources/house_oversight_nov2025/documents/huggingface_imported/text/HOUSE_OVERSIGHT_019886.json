  "text": "“Bolton’s mustache is a problem,” snorted Bannon. “Trump doesn’t think he looks the\npart. You know Bolton is an acquired taste.”\n\n“Well, rumors were that he got in trouble because he got in a fight in a hotel one night\nand chased some woman.”\n\n“If I told Trump that, he might have the job.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nBannon was curiously able to embrace Trump while at the same time suggesting he did\nnot take him entirely seriously. He had first met Trump, the on-again off-again presidential\ncandidate, in 2010; at a meeting in Trump Tower, Bannon had proposed to Trump that he\nspend half a million dollars backing Tea Party-style candidates as a way to further his\npresidential ambitions. Bannon left the meeting figuring that Trump would never cough up\nthat kind of dough. He just wasn’t a serious player. Between that first encounter and mid-\nAugust 2016, when he took over the Trump campaign, Bannon, beyond a few interviews\nhe had done with Trump for his Breitbart radio show, was pretty sure he hadn’t spent more\nthan ten minutes in one-on-one conversation with Trump.\n\nBut now Bannon’s Zeitgeist moment had arrived. Everywhere there was a sudden\nsense of global self-doubt. Brexit in the UK, waves of immigrants arriving on Europe’s\nangry shores, the disenfranchisement of the workingman, the specter of more financial\nmeltdown, Bernie Sanders and his liberal revanchism—everywhere was backlash. Even\nthe most dedicated exponents of globalism were hesitating. Bannon believed that great\nnumbers of people were suddenly receptive to a new message: the world needs borders—\nor the world should return to a time when it had borders. When America was great. Trump\nhad become the platform for that message.\n\nBy that January evening, Bannon had been immersed in Donald Trump’s world for\nalmost five months. And though he had accumulated a sizable catalogue of Trump’s\npeculiarities, and cause enough for possible alarm about the unpredictability of his boss\nand his views, that did not detract from Trump’s extraordinary, charismatic appeal to the\nright-wing, Tea Party, Internet meme base, and now, in victory, from the opportunity he\nwas giving Steve Bannon.\n\nOOK Ok\n\n“Does he get it?” asked Ailes suddenly, pausing and looking intently at Bannon.\n\nHe meant did Trump get it. This seemed to be a question about the right-wing agenda:\nDid the playboy billionaire really get the workingman populist cause? But it was possibly\na point-blank question about the nature of power itself. Did Trump get where history had\nput him?\n\nBannon took a sip of water. “He gets it,” said Bannon, after hesitating for perhaps a\nbeat too long. “Or he gets what he gets.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019886",
