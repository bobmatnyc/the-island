  "text": "186\n\nThe day after his attempt to pressure the Washington Post, he asked Greenwald to drop\neverything he was doing and immediately fly to Hong Kong. He had, it will be recalled, already\nsent Poitras an enciphered file, and told her she would get the key once she and Greenwald\nfollowed his instructions. Presumably, he wanted Greenwald’s story and the video done in Hong\nKong before he became a suspect. If they had immediately flown to Hong Kong that May, it still\nmight have left Snowden an escape window.\n\nAs Snowden found out, when dealing with journalists, things do not always go as planned.\nGreenwald, although agreeing to come to Hong Kong, waited in New York for two days while\nthe Guardian editors completed their due diligence. Poitras waited with him. As a result of this\ndelay, Snowden’s clock ran out. Greenwald and Poitras did not arrive at his hotel in Hong Kong\nuntil June 3° It would be only hours before he became a prime suspect. “It was a nervous\nperiod,” Snowden recalled. Although he bravely told the Guardian, “there was no risk of\ncompromise/” That claim was, at best, wishful thinking on his part.\n\nBy this time, he was no longer invisible. Not only had he registered at the hotel under his true\nname and provided his credit card, but he was he in contact with three high-profile journalists,\ntwo well-known hacktavists and, as he suggested to Gellman, a foreign diplomatic mission. Even\nif Snowden had failed to persuade the Washington Post to publish a coded identifier, the mission’s\ninterest would likely be piqued when the newspaper published it first story on June 5\". Even if\nadversary intelligence services had missed Snowden and his archive of NSA documents earlier in\nMay, they would not neglect the availability of such a prize after the NSA stories broke in the\nGuardian and Washington Post on June 5\". Greenwald even went on TV in Hong Kong,\nrevealing to every interested intelligence service, in the unlikely event that that they did not\nalready know, that a defector from the NSA was in Hong Kong.\n\nNow there was no point in keeping his identity a secret. On June 9\" Poitras released the\nfamous video showing Snowden a secret NSA documents, At this point, Snowden shone so\nbrightly as a beacon that every player in the in the intelligence game would realize that Snowden\nwas a pawn to be captured.\n\nSnowden still was able to fog over his travel plans, at least in the media, by telling reporters\nthat he intended to remain in Hong Kong and fight extradition in court, but certainly the Russian\nofficials whom he contacted knew he had other plans. They had even relayed his request to go to\nRussia to Putin. His movements were also no secret to sophisticated intelligence services. In an\nera in Hong Kong ii which cell phones emit their GPS location every 3 seconds and CCTV\ncameras scan many street intersections, it is not easy to conceal one’s whereabouts. In\nSnowden’s case, his photograph was constantly on television, posters and giant billboards. Even\nif he threw away his own phone, his retinue of lawyers and helpers could be tracked with ease.\n\nChina, who’s President, Xi Jinping was meeting President Obama for the first time in Rancho\nMirage, California on June 9\", would have certainly been keenly interested in the unfolding\nSnowden affair. After all, Obama had publically put on his agenda that week calling Xi to task for\nChinese cyber espionage. Such a charge was undermined by Snowden’s globally-publicized\naccusation that the United States was engaged in massive cyber espionage. In any event, as US\nintelligence verified, China had, almost immediately after the release of the video, instituted a full\ncourt press of Snowden in Hong Kong. Its security apparatus presumably had the means to\nmonitor his room as well as those of Poitras and Greenwald. From that moment on, it is not\nlikely that any communication or movement, Snowden made during his next 18 days in Hong\nKong would escape its scrutiny.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020338",
