  "text": "[9\n\nregimes at a conference in Qatar that “the region’s foundations are\nsinking into the sand.” Within days, demonstrators filled Cairo’s\nTahrir Square, a vibrant plea for greater freedom that swiftly spread\nto Jordan, Yemen, Bahrain, Oman, Libya, and eventually even Syria.\nBut if Madam Secretary could be ahead of the curve, she was also\nsometimes behind it, caught in a dizzying series of upheavals that left\nher both exhilarated and exhausted. In early February, Hillary said\nthe regime of Hosni Mubarak was “stable”; he was gone 17 days\nlater. When she felt White House officials were pushing too hard in\npublic statements for Mubarak to resign, Hillary complained to\nPresident Obama, who was unmoved. Yet on the big picture,\nespecially the need to isolate the menacing regime in Tehran, the\npresident and his secretary of state fully agreed. They understood\nimmediately that, for all the facile accusations of inconsistency and\nhypocrisy, a one-size-fits-all foreign policy wouldn’t work.\nDoctrines, they felt, were for the doctrinaire.\n\nHillary had been one of the first in the administration to privately\nraise the issue of a no-fly zone. But she retreated when her main ally\nin the Cabinet, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, loudly and publicly\nsaid a no-fly zone would mean attacking ground positions, and it was\na bad idea to get involved in Libya. The White House was searching\nfor a way to arm the rebels—a strategy Hillary found problematic—\nbut also resisted a no-fly zone. “Lots of people throw around phrases\nlike no-fly zone. They talk about it as though it’s just a video game,”\nWhite House chief of staff Bill Daley said dismissively.\n\nHillary decided to push her case on March 12, after the Arab League\nvoted to request action from the U.N. Security Council—an\nextraordinary decision to break Arab ranks and ask the nations they\nhad for so long denounced as colonialists to help. “Their statement\nmoved her,” said a close aide, adding that two meanings of “moved”\napplied.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024976",
