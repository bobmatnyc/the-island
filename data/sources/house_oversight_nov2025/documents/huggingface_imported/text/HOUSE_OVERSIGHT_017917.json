  "text": "In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 392 F.Supp.2d 539 (2005)\n\n10 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 789\n\nDr. Al-Nafissa states that private charities in the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia receive governmental approval\nthrough Royal Order, are run by boards, and disburse\n*552 funds in accordance with their charters. (Al-Nafissa\nDecl. § 5.) In contrast, governmental commissions, such\nas SHC, are chaired by a governmental official, like\nPrince Salman, and conduct their affairs in accordance\nwith the Kingdom’s policy objectives. Ud. § 5.)\nAccording to Dr. Al-Nafissa, “[d]ecisions regarding\ncauses to support and recipients for Saudi High\nCommission funds are within the discretion of the\nExecutive Committee, the Supreme Commission, and\nPrince Salman.” (/d. § 8.) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nis SHC’s largest source of funding, having provided\napproximately 30% of the funds used and distributed by\nSHC. (Al-Roshood Decl. § 24.) The remainder of SHC\nfunds are collected through fundraisers “in accordance\nwith the directives of ... King Fahd.” Ud. 9 5.) SHC can be\nsued for its administrative acts in the Board of\nGrievances. (Al-Nafissa Decl. § 8.)\n\nIn their complaint, the Federal Plaintiffs alleged that SHC\nis “an agency, instrumentality and organ of the Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia.” (Federal Compl. § 181.) They now\nback away from that allegation and join other Plaintiffs in\ndisputing SHC’s status. Plaintiffs submit that SHC has\nrepeatedly and systematically described itself as a\nnon-governmental organization in representations to the\nBosnian government. (See Plaintiffs’ Mem. in Opp’n to\nSHC Mot. to Dismiss at 10.) Thus, even if SHC is\nconsidered a foreign state, Plaintiffs assert it has\nimplicitly waived its immunity through those\nrepresentations. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) (FSIA waiver\nprovision). Plaintiffs also argue that it is disingenuous for\nSHC to simultaneously maintain that it is an organ of the\nKingdom and that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction\nover it when the Kingdom itself did not dispute the\npersonal jurisdiction issue.\n\nIn response to Plaintiffs’ arguments that it described itself\nas a non-governmental organization to Bosnian\nauthorities, SHC submits the declaration of\nHadsimuratovic Hajrudin, a Bosnian lawyer who serves\nas a legal advisor to SHC. (See generally Hajrudin Decl.\nat SHC Reply Ex. A.) Mr. Hajrudin states that SHC\ncharacterized itself as non-governmental in accordance\nwith Article 22 of the Law on Humanitarian Activities\nand Humanitarian Organizations of the Federation of\nBosnia and Herzegovina because SHC is “not considered\npart of the government of Bosnia—Herzegovina.” (/d. § 4.)\nMr. Hajrudin attests that the head of SHC’s European\nOffice received diplomatic status in Bosnia—Herzegovina\nin 1996 because SHC is an organization of the Saudi\n\nWESTLAW\n\ngovernment. (/d. J 6.) He also states that the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia is represented by SHC when it makes\ndonations to Bosnia—Herzegovina. (/d.)\n\n(61 There is no dispute that SHC is a separate legal person\nfrom the Kingdom and not a citizen of the United States\nor any third country. See 28 U.S.C. § 1603. Accordingly,\nthe only dispute regarding SHC’s status is whether it is an\norgan of the Kingdom. In Filler v. Hanvit Bank, 378 F.3d\n213 (2d Cir.2004), the Second Circuit considered various\nfactors to determine whether an entity could be\nconsidered an organ of a foreign sovereign. Jd. at 217.\nThe factors include:\n\n(1) whether the foreign state\ncreated the entity for a national\npurpose; (2) whether the foreign\nstate actively supervises the entity;\n(3) whether the foreign state\nrequires the hiring of public\nemployees and pays their salaries;\n(4) whether the entity holds\nexclusive rights to some right in the\n[foreign] country; and (5) how the\nentity is treated under foreign state\nlaw.\n\nId. at 217 (citations omitted).\n\nSHC offers undisputed evidence that it was created by the\nKingdom’s Council of *553 Ministers to “centralize all\ncharitable giving from the Kingdom to\nBosnia—Herzegovina [and that it was] vested with the sole\nauthority to collect and distribute charitable funds in\nBosnia.” (Al-Roshood Decl. [J 5—6; Hajrudin Decl. 9 6 &\nEx. D (noting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia provides\nhumanitarian relief to Bosnia through SHC).) The Council\nof Ministers appointed Prince Salman to supervise SHC.\n(Al Roshood Decl. 9§ 7-9.) The salaries of SHC\nemployees are paid by either the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia or out of the SHC budget. Ud. § 10.) Like other\nSaudi Arabian government agencies, SHC can be sued in\nthe administrative court of the Kingdom. (Al—Nafissa\nDecl. { 8.)\n\nThe Court finds that SHC has made a prima facie showing\nthat it is a foreign sovereign. See Cargill, 991 F.2d at\n1016 (requiring defendant to make prima facie case of\nsovereignty). Because SHC was formed by order of the\nKingdom’s governing body, it provides the Kingdom’s\naid to Bosnia, it is governed by a Saudi official and its\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017917",
