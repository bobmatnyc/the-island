  "text": "Consequences of Inaction — Investor Perspective\n\ne Short Term, No Problem Yet\n\nGlobal bond investors, in part, have looked past USA Inc.’s\ndeteriorating financials because growth, inflation, and Fed\npurchases matter more, and because income statements and\nbalance sheets of many other developed countries (Such as\nGreece / Spain / Portugal / Ireland) are worse.\n\ne Long Term, Consequences of Inaction Could Be Severe\n\nIf USA Inc.’s “managers” and “board” continue to ignore rising\nunfunded entitlement spending, investors could eventually demand\na higher return to lend money to USA Inc. — leading to rising bond\nyields / higher borrowing costs for USA Inc. At some point, USA\nInc.’s currency could also weaken significantly.\n\nSource: Richard Berner, “America’s Fiscal Train Wreck” (7/2/2009), Morgan Stanley Research.\n\nKP\nwww.kpcb.com USA Inc. | Consequences of Inaction 415\n\nFor Perspective, USA Inc.'s 55% Public Debt as % of GDP (2009) is in Middle of Pack\nWhen Compared with ‘Top 25’ Global Peers, Though Rising to 90% ‘Warning’ Level*\n\nRank Country\n\nAs % of Net Debt as % of GDP As%of 2009 Budget As % of 2009\n2009 Net Debt World 05-09 | 2009 GDP World Surplus/ World Gross Unemploy- Y/Y\nOutstanding ($B) Y/Y Total 2009 2005 Change ($B) YIY Total Deficit ($B) Deficit ment Rate (pps)\n\n=\n\nON Onahwonhd\n\nJapan\nItaly\nGreece\nBelgium\nFrance\nGermany\nAustria\n\nNetherlands\nArgentina\nUSA\nPoland\nSpain\nNorway\nSweden\nBrazil\nSwitzerland\nDenmark\nTurkey\nAustralia\nVenezuela\nChina\nRussia\n\n°\nxs\n\nNoaogoeenNnagaoeen\n\n®obsatdtdrtobkhnbndbaohkhdboaohkhadnonagd\nNOoO ANA aA aA wWaAaBaNAGAANANA OG AA\n\n1\n1\n6\n7\n1\n2\n4\n3\n1\n1\n3\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n2\n0\n\nTop 1-25\nGlobal\n\n$32,438 $47,081 -3% 81% $2,790\n34,632 57,937 -2 100 2,885\n\nNote: “Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the relationship between government debt and real GDP growth\nis weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. . We\nnote that while Reinhart and Rogoff's observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer to the European countries’ definition of government\n\ngross debt.
