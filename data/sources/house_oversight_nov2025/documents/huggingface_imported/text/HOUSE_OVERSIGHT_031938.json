  "text": "26\n\nThis fear that al-Qaeda’s extreme tactics were burning too hot and\nalienating Muslims was also the theme of a remarkable message that\nAtiyah sent in 2005 to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the murderous chief\nof al-Qaeda in Iraq. In this document, made public five years ago by\nthe United States, Attyah warned that fomenting Sunni-Shiite\nviolence (which was Zarqawi’s trademark) was potentially ruinous.\nThe al-Qaeda that emerges from these documents is a badly battered\nand disoriented group. The June 3 death of Ilyas Kashmiri in a drone\nattack illustrates the organization’s continuing vulnerability.\nKashmiri was a ruthless operator who planned the 2008 Mumbai\nattacks that killed 166 people and was plotting deadly attacks on\nEurope last winter that were stopped only because of aggressive\ncounterterrorism work. (Security services from Europe and Turkey\narrested about 20 of Kashmiri’s operatives before they could carry\nout the attacks.)\n\nWhen top U.S. officials summarize their view of al-Qaeda now, in the\nrun-up to the 9/11 anniversary, they describe an organization that is\ndown but certainly not out. They don’t know of any specific plots\ntargeting the United States, 10 years on. But they’re looking, pulsing\nevery channel they know. They recognize that it’s what we still don’t\nknow about al-Qaeda that’s most dangerous.\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031938",
