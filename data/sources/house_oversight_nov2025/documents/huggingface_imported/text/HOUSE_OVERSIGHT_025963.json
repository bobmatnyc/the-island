He manages to come across as very subversive, while rarely\noffending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance).\n\nHe also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for him.\nThis invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very few of\nhis ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from others.\n\nI am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding.

I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive\nwhen I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam (who\nwas as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not feel like\nconceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that humans have\nvery specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other ideas), and his\nfrustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them.\n\nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a\ncultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, but\nit seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a very\nintricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition\nworks layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few\nyears to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and\nafter the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in\nchild development, that have famously been described by Piaget.\n\nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The\nswitching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in other\napes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their brains are\nmature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations are quite a bit\nfaster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in very poor and\nsocially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive development even\nafter controlling for family income.\n\nGorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4\n\nyears. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their\nbrains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain.
