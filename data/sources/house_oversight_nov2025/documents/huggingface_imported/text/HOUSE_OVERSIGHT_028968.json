We’re planning to publish a story on the suit this afternoon, and we\nwant to make sure it is fair. Is Mr. Epstein available to speak? Or do you want to offer a comment on this\nbehalf?\n\nMy number is] and I’m available any time. I also just tried your cell phone.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nDavid Ingram\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028968",
