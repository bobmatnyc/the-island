  "text": "purporting to limit the enforcement discretion of the Department of\nJustice may be given. The requesting issuer or domestic concern may rely\nonly upon a written FCPA opinion letter signed by the Attorney General\nor his designee.”).\n\n“528 C.KR. § 80.8. FCPA opinions do not bind or obligate any agency\nother than DOJ. They also do not affect the requesting party’s obligations\nto any other agency or under any statutory or regulatory provision other\nthan those specifically cited in the particular FCPA opinion. 28 C.ER. §\n80.11. Ifthe conduct for which an FCPA opinion is requested is subject\nto approval by any other agency, such FCPA opinion may not be taken\n\nto indicate DOJ’s views on any legal or factual issues before that other\nagency. 28 C.ER. § 80.13.\n\n41628 C.RR. § 80.10. DOJ can rebut this presumption by a\npreponderance of the evidence. A court determining whether the\npresumption has been rebutted weighs all relevant factors, including\nwhether the submitted information was accurate and complete and the\nactivity was within the scope of conduct specified in the request. Td. As of\nSeptember 2012, DOJ has never pursued an enforcement action against a\nparty for conduct that formed the basis of an FCPA opinion stating that\nthe prospective conduct would violate DOJ’s present enforcement policy.\n47 Asa general matter, DOJ normally anonymizes much of the\ninformation in its publicly released opinions and includes the general\nnature and circumstances of the proposed conduct. DOJ does not release\nthe identity of any foreign sales agents or other types of identifying\ninformation. 28 C.ER. § 80.14(b). However, DOJ may release the\nidentity of the requesting party, the foreign country in which the\nproposed. conduct is to take place, and any actions DOJ took in response\nto the FCPA opinion request. Jd. Ifa party believes that an opinion\ncontains proprietary information, it may request that DOJ remove or\nanonymize those portions of the opinion before it is publicly released. 28\nCER. § 80.14(c).\n\n41898 CER. § 80.16.\n\n120\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022622",
