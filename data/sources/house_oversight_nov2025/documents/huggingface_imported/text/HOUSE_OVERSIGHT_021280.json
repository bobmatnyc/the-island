  "text": "did Nygren oppose the caritas view of\nChristian love? The answer is that the\nmeaning of love as caritas did exactly\nwhat Nygren thought Paul and Luther,\nhis theological heroes, did not do. In the\nclassic Roman Catholic view, love as\ncaritas builds on eros. Caritas was seen\nto include natural desires for health and\naffiliation. But the caritas view of love\nalso held that religious education and\nGod’s grace built on and expanded these\nnatural inclinations to entail a self-giving\nbenevolence to others, even strangers\nand enemies — an idea so central to the\nconcept of Christian love.\n\nAll of this seemed too\nnaturalistic for Nygren. It seemed to\nplay down the importance of God’s\ntransforming grace. He joined other\nEuropean neo-orthodox theologians of\nhis day such as Karl Barth and Rudolph\nBultmann in cutting off Christian love\nfrom eros,'' which in effect was to cut\nChristian love from nature and desire —\nthe very things scientists tend to study.\nBeginning with Nygren’s strong view of\nagape and the strong supernaturalism of\nboth Nygren and Barth, there was little\nroom in these mid-twentieth century\nProtestant trends for a productive\ndialogue between Christian ethics and\nthe new scientific advances in moral\npsychology, evolutionary psychology,\nand neuroscience.\n\nAt the same time, however,\nbreakthroughs in these very disciplines\nhave led to a new reassessment of the\nCatholic caritas model of Christian love.\nBut before I review in more detail how\nthis model worked, especially in the\nthought of the great medieval Roman\nCatholic theologian Thomas Aquinas, let\nme turn to review some of the moral\nimplications of insights into kin altruism\nand inclusive fitness emerging today\n\nPage |34\n\nfrom evolutionary psychology and social\nneuroscience.\n\nMoral Implications of Kin Altruism\nand Inclusive Fitness\n\nAs is well known, the idea of\ninclusive fitness was first put forth in\n1964 by William Hamilton. '”\nHamilton’s view of inclusive fitness\nholds that living beings not only struggle\nfor their individual survival but for the\nsurvival of offspring and kin who also\ncarry their genes. Their altruism is\nlikely to be proportional to the\npercentage of their genes that others\ncarry. This insight was further\ndeveloped by the concept of parental\ninvestment. Ronald Fisher and Robert\nTrivers (1972) defined it as “any\ninvestment by the parent in an individual\noffspring that increases the offspring’s\nchance of surviving...at the cost of the\nparent’s ability to invest in other\noffspring.” '? These insights were at the\ncore of the emerging field of\nsociobiology and were first brought to\nthe wider public attention by E.O.\nWilson’s Sociobiology: The New\nSynthesis (1975). \"*\n\nBut the moral implications of the\nconcept of inclusive fitness, parental\ninvestment, and kin altruism have\nreceived competing interpretations.\nRichard Dawkins in his The Selfish Gene\n(1976) turned these ideas into a defense\nof philosophical ethical egoism and\nargued that all altruistic acts are\ndisguised maneuvers to perpetuate our\nown genes. '° But there are other\ninterpretations. Social neuroscientist\nJohn Cacioppo interprets our motives\ntoward inclusive fitness and kin altruism\nas the core of human intergenerational\ncare and the vital link between sociality\nand spirituality. In cooperation with his\ncolleagues, his research on loneliness\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021280",
