Edward Gibbon once described\nhistory as being little better than a record of the “crimes, follies and\nmisfortunes of mankind.” Imperialism certainly added its quota to\nthese. But the question is whether it also provided, through Hegel’s\n“cunning of reason,” the means to escape from them. Even Marx\njustified British rule in India on these grounds. Ferguson, too, can\nmake a sound argument for such a proposition.\n\nThe most serious weakness in Ferguson’s presentation is his lack of\nsympathy for the civilizations dismissed as “the rest,” which also\npoints to the most serious limitation of the revisionist case. The\n“triumph of the West” that followed the collapse of communism in\nEurope was clearly not the “end of history.” As Ferguson must know,\nthe main topic of discussion in international affairs nowadays\nconcerns the “rise” of China, and more generally Asia, as well as the\nstirring of Islam.\n\nOf course, the Chinese may prefer to talk about “restoration” rather\nthan “rise,” and point to a “harmonious” pluralism of the future. But\n“rise” is how most people think of China’s recent history, and in\nhistory the rise of some is usually associated with the decline of\nothers. In other words, we may be reverting to that cyclical pattern\nthat historians assumed to be axiomatic before the seemingly\nirreversible rise of the West implanted in them a view of linear\nprogress toward greater reason and freedom.\n\nEurope is plainly in decline, politically and culturally, though most\nEuropeans, blinded by their high living standards and the pretensions\nof their impotent statesmen, are happy to dress this up as progress.\nChinese savings are underwriting much of the American civilizing\nmission that Ferguson applauds. The pattern seems clear: the West is\nlosing dynamism, and the rest are gaining it.\n\nThe remainder of this century will show how this shift plays out. For\nthe moment, most of us have lost the historical plot. It is possible, for\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030055",
