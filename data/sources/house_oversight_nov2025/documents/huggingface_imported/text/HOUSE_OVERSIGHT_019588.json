A judge in Stockholm ordered his detention on suspicion\nof rape, sexual molestation, and unlawful coercion. He denied the\ncharges but was arrested in London on a European arrest warrant. In\nDecember, he was released on a $312,700 bail deposit (supplied by\nhis supporters) and confined to Ellingham Hall in Norfolk, England.\nWhile awaiting the outcome of the extradition proceedings, he lived\nthere with Sarah Harrison, his twenty-eight-year-old deputy at\nWikiLeaks. A graduate of the elite Sevenoaks School in Kent, Harri-\nson served as Assange’s liaison with the outside world.

According to Assange, Snowden needed\nhelp for his exit plan. He wanted Assange to use WikiLeaks’s\n“resources” to get him out of Hong Kong. Assange considered it a\nsurprising request, because Snowden had not given any of the stolen\ndocuments to WikiLeaks. In their discussion, according to Assange,\nSnowden claimed that one reason he decided to take the secret NSA\ndocuments was the brutal treatment of Bradley Manning after he\nwas arrested in 2010 by the U.S. government. “Snowden told me\nthey had abused Manning in a way that contributed to his decision\nto become a whistle-blower,” Assange said in an interview in 2015.\n\nIf Manning’s mistreatment was Snowden’s motive, it was a sharp\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 100 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019588",
