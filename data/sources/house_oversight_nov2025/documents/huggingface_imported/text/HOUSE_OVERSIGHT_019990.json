  "text": "adopted a sort of 1950s Jewish uncle (tough-guy variety) delivery, with assorted\nYiddishisms—Hillary Clinton, he declared, had been “shlonged” in the 2008 primary—\nhelping to give an inarticulate man an unexpected expressiveness. Now his daughter, a de\nfacto First Lady, was, through her conversion, the first Jew in the White House.\n\nThe Trump campaign and the White House were constantly supplying off-note\nmessages about Jews, from their equivocal regard for David Duke to their apparent desire\nto tinker with Holocaust history—or at least tendency to stumble over it. At one point\nearly in the campaign, Trump’s son-in-law, challenged by his own staff at the New York\nObserver and feeling pressure about his own bona fides, as well as seeking to stand by his\nfather-in-law, wrote an impassioned defense of Trump in an attempt to prove that he was\nnot an anti-Semite. For his efforts, Jared was rebuked by various members of his own\nfamily, who clearly seemed worried about both the direction of Trumpism and Jared’s\nopportunism.\n\nThere was also the flirtation with European populism. Whenever possible, Trump\nseemed to side with and stoke Europe’s rising right, with its anti-Semitic associations,\npiling on more portent and bad vibes. And then there was Bannon, who had allowed\nhimself to become—through his orchestration of right-wing media themes and stoking of\nliberal outrage—a winking suggestion of anti-Semitism. It was certainly good right-wing\nbusiness to annoy liberal Jews.\n\nKushner, for his part, was the prepped-out social climber who had rebuffed all\nentreaties in the past to support traditional Jewish organizations. When called upon, the\nbillionaire scion had refused to contribute. Nobody was more perplexed by the sudden rise\nof Jared Kushner to his new position as Israel’s great protector than U.S. Jewish\norganizations. Now, the Jewish great and the good, the venerated and the tried, the\nmandarins and myrmidons, had to pay court to Jared Kushner ... who until little more than\na few minutes ago had truly been a nobody.\n\nFor Trump, giving Israel to Kushner was not only a test, it was a Jewish test: the\npresident was singling him out for being Jewish, rewarding him for being Jewish, saddling\nhim with an impossible hurdle for being Jewish—and, too, defaulting to the stereotyping\nbelief in the negotiating powers of Jews. “Henry Kissinger says Jared is going to be the\nnew Henry Kissinger,” Trump said more than once, rather a combined compliment and\nslur.\n\nBannon, meanwhile, did not hesitate to ding Kushner on Israel, that peculiar right-wing\nlitmus test. Bannon could bait Jews—globalist, cosmopolitan, Davoscentric liberal Jews\nlike Kushner—because the farther right you were, the more correct you were on Israel.\nNetanyahu was an old Kushner family friend, but when, in the fall, the Israeli prime\nminister came to New York to meet with Trump and Kushner, he made a point of seeking\nout Steve Bannon.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019990",
