They attempted, through\nbilateral talks, to capitalize on the basic ideas put forward by President Clinton. In\nspite of high hopes inspired by the Taba talks, hope was dashed by Israeli intransigence,\nreinforced by the violent uprising across the West Bank and Gaza, as well as internal\ntensions within the Palestinian leadership.\n\nIn an attempt to revive the peace process, President George W. Bush, in a speech in\nthe Rose Garden in June 2002, took the bold step of publicly declaring support for an\nindependent Palestinian state. However, he was convinced that Chairman Arafat was\nan impediment to peace, due to the continuing violence against Israelis emanating\nfrom Gaza and the West Bank. The President made further US involvement in peace\nnegotiations contingent upon Arafat’s removal from power, and the implementation of\ndemocratic reforms in the Palestinian Authority’s political structure. This was consist-\nent with Prime Minister Sharon’s policies. At this time, parts of the Palestinian\nleadership either passively turned a blind eye to the rise of bombings in Israel, or\ndiscreetly encouraged it. Arafat became a pariah for several essential players and was\nisolated in his Muqata headquarters in Ramallah.\n\nUnder these dire circumstances, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a\nmeeting in the conference room of his executive office at United Nations’ Headquarters\nin New York with the US, Russia, and the European Union. The frustration was deep\namongst all parties. Bilateral talks did not happen. Trilateral talks did not work. In\nresponse to the breakdown of the peace process, he suggested that the four actors\ncoordinate a position to restart the process. The idea was to combine the political\npower of the US, Russia’s credibility amongst key Arab states, the European Union’s\nfinancial muscle, and the UN’s legitimacy in a potent new international coalition. The\nUN Secretary-General coined the phrase the “Middle East Quartet” for this informal\ngroup. The Quartet met both at principals level and at the level of special envoys.\n\nA novel approach to the imbroglio of Middle East peacemaking was launched:\nmultilateral unilateralism. The concept was launched at a Quartet Envoys’ working\ndinner at the Norwegian Ambassador’s residence in Herzliya (a suburb of Tel Aviv) by\nUS officials William Burns and David Satterfield. The idea was for the Quartet\nmembers to collectively produce an operational peace plan to be presented to the\nparties for implementation, without prior consultation. This resulted in the Quartet\npeace plan, referred to as the Road Map, which was eventually presented to the parties\nas an ultimatum in 2003. In other words, a unified position was imposed by a group of\nthird parties upon the disputants—thus, multilateral unilateralism.\n\nThe Quartet collectively submitted the text to Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud\nAbbas. The US ambassador to Israel presented it to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,\nwho refused to meet with the Quartet as a whole. The Palestinian side accepted the\nproposals in total while the Israeli side came up with fourteen reservations.\n\nThe Oslo Accords mapped a path towards a possible peace agreement, setting up\nmilestones to be passed along the way, and stipulating that the ride on this bumpy road\nwould take five years. It did not define the end point of the journey, because the parties\nwere not capable of closing the gaps between their positions at the time. The 2003\nPerformance-Based Road Map of the Quartet was, in many ways, the paper that\nconcluded the Declaration of Principles of 1993, by designating the last milestone,\nthe establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023167",
