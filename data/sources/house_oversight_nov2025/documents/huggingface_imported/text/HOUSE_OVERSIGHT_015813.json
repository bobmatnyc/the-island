  "text": "The Brain 123\n\nParamecium\n\nDNA into its two complementary strands when a cell divides. In single-\ncelled organisms, including paramecium, the ends of the tubes stick out\nof the body and form the cilia that drive the organism along.\n\nThe presence of tubulin in complex, single-celled organisms\nprovides a clue that the smallest information processing unit might not\nbe the neuron. Some single cell organisms, such as paramecium, display\ncomplex behavior: hunting for prey and escaping danger. This suggests\nthey can process small amounts of information without the need for a\nmatrix of neurons. Since we evolved from these organisms, why wouldn't\nour brain cells take advantage of this sub-cellular intelligence?\n\nThe structure of tubulin lends itself to digital processing as the\nmolecules forming the walls have two stable states and can flip between\nthem. We might recognize this as the basis of a binary computer, and\ncells might have little computers within them. They would not need to\nprocess many bits to be useful. Perhaps single-cell organisms developed\ninformation processing capabilities in their micro tube structures that\nallowed them to better survive and, as their nervous systems evolved, they\ncoupled these structures to form the brains we see today. This piece of\ntheory is not too controversial. After all, nerves have wiring within them\nto carry information to the synapses and it’s likely this wiring is involved\nin the thinking process. But Hameroff is not finished. He has teamed up\nwith Roger Penrose to bring quantum mechanics into the picture.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015813",
