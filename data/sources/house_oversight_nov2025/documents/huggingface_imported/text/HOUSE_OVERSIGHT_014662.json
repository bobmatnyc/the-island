Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in\nDecember, when he was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner.\n\nIt is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has attended as Epstein’s guest.\n\nA lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was\na guest at a cocktail party thrown by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models.\n‘Some guests were horrified,’ said the article's author, Vicky Ward.\n\nit should not be forgotten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his\nsentence for offences relating to child prostitution.\n\nHowever, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one\nreading The Mail on Sunday's interview with the woman who was prepared to testify against him can\nbe in any doubt of the seriousness of the charges.\n\nEpstein, a Wall Street money manager who once counted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his\nfriends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2005 after the stepmother of a 14-year\nold girl claimed she was paid $200 (£125) to give him an ‘erotic massage’.\n\nThe subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 20 girls levelling sexual allegations against him.\nEventually, Epstein struck a ‘plea bargain’ with prosecutors — a practice not permitted under British\nlaw — under which he was allowed to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges.\n\nPolice claim that his donations to politicians and his ‘dream team’ of influential lawyers deterred\nprosecutors from bringing more serious charges of sex-trafficking. The deal certainly kept the names\nof a lot of Epstein’s famous friends out of an embarrassing court case.\n\nHowever, an unusual part of the agreement was that Epstein’s alleged victims were allowed to bring\ncivil proceedings against him.\n\nHe has so far made 17 out-of-court settlements, and some cases are ongoing. One of these girls\nwas to have been a key witness for the prosecution had the case gone to trial. She was just 15\nyears old when she was drawn into Epstein’s exploitative world in 1998.\n\nIn her civil writ against him, under the pseudonym Jane Doe 102’ she alleged that her duties\nincluded being ‘sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peers including royalty’.\n\nNow, horrified by the evidence of Epstein and Andrew enjoying each other’s company in New York,\nJane Doe 102 has agreed to waive her anonymity and tell for the first time her deeply disturbing\nstory.\n\nHer real name is Virginia Roberts and she now lives in Australia, where she is a happily married\nmother of three.\n\nOver the course of a week during which she spoke at length to The Mail on Sunday, she appeared\nsometimes vuinerabie, and sometimes steely, but always quietly resolute and consistent.\n\nRevisiting events from a past that she had hoped she had left behind, Virginia occasionally buried\nher face in her hands.\n\nSome recollections — and, for reasons of taste, not all the details can be included here — caused her\nto flush with shame. ‘I'm telling you things that even my husband didn’t know,’ she said.\n\nVirginia, who has undergone counselling to try to come to terms with her past, is honest about her\ninitiation into Epstein’s depraved world.\n\nShe was a troubled teenager, whose slender figure, delicate complexion, hesitant voice and soulful\nblue eyes made her look young for her years.\n\nBorn in Sacramento, California, in August 1983, Virginia spent her early years on a small ranch on\nthe West Coast of America.\n\nThis seemingly idyllic childhood ended when she was sexually molested by a man close to her\nfamily.\n\nThe fallout from that led to her parents temporarily splitting up. Blaming herself, Virginia began to\nget into trouble Aged 11, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.\n\nLiving on the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘1\nwas a paedophile’s dream,’ she says.\n\nThree years later, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had\nmoved to Palm Beach,\n\nFlorida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump's country club, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nVirginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her 15th\nbirthday, she met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.\n\n‘| was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top — when | was\napproached by Ghislaine,’ Virginia says.\n\n‘! told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman\nwho was looking for a travelling masseuse.\n\nI'd get training and be paid well. Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being\nhanded the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer.\n\nHe drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also owns a nine-storey\nhome in New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,500-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New\n\nhttp:/Awww.dailym ail.co.uk/news/article- 1361039/Prince-Andrew-girl-17-sex-offender-friend-flew-Britain-meet-him.htm!\n\nCase 1:15°OeOd Se Ray” Dereuerrert Dneig toBileid (G94 51 Halpyg@ningf 9\n\n‘Nesd a tight tush’:\nLeAnn Rimes illustrates\nhow to get a firm ‘booty’\nas she does yoga in\nskimpy tank top and\nleggings\nExercise tips\n\n‘twant them raally big!’\nBlonde bombshell begs\ndactors to make her\n1,000cc implants - even\nafter they insist her\nenhanced breasts are\n‘perfect’\n\nOn Botched\n\n‘it's my fourth favorite\nreality show!
