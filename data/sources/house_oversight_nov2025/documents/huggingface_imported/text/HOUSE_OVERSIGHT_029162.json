  "text": "IF THIS IS TRUE—THAT “HUMAN COOPERATION AMONG KIN” and also AMONG\n“CLOSE ASSOCIATES”—“MAY REQUIRE ENFORCEMENT OF NORMS BY THIRD\nPARTIES”, THEN I HAVE WASTED 40 YEARS OF MY LIFE ON THESE TOPICS.\n\nTHE MORE GENERAL PROBLEM WITH PETER’S BIAS IS THAT SO LITTLE OF\nINTEREST HAS EMERGED FROM CULTURAL ARGUMENTATION. CONTRAST\nGENETIC. FOR EXAMPLE, WE NOW KNOW THAT WHEN MATERNAL\nGRANDMOTHERS INVEST IN THEIR CHILDREN’S CHILDREN, BOTH\nGRANDDAUGHTERS AND GRANDSONS BENEFIT, WHILE WHEN PATERNAL\nGRANDMOTHERS DO THE INVESTING, GRANDDAUGHTERS BENEFIT WHILE\nGRANDSONS ARE HARMED. THIS WAS PREDICTED BASED ON THE DIFFERENT\nWAY IN WHICH THE GRANDMOTHER'S X CHROMOSOME IS INHERITED IN THE\nTWO SYSTEMS. NO “CULTURAL” ARGUMENTATION HAS COME ANYWHERE CLOSE.\n\nOR TAKE THE LOGIC OF SO-CALLED HONOUR KILLINGS, WHICH I HAVE NOW\nWORKED ON INTENSIVELY FOR TWO YEARS. NOTHING OF USE FROM CULTURAL\n“THEORY” BUT A POWERFUL ARGUMENT BASED ON THE EFFECTS OF REPEATED\nFIRST COUSIN MARRIAGES IN MUSLIM SOCIETIES—AND IN HINDU SOCIETIES\nENDOGAMOUS CASTES IN COMPETITION WITH EACH OTHER.
