  "text": "priorities, such as political and economic reforms. Israel has long\nbranded the Arab world as tribal and undemocratic, in order to brand\nitself the only democracy in the Middle East. Well, soon enough it\nwon’t be. Many of its neighbors will soon join the democratic world\nas demands for democracy grow. Democracy will mean more\ndevelopment, prosperity and people’s power. It means more popular\nparticipation in decision making and awareness of the possibilities of\nthe nation and what it can and cannot do. It may not mean more\nhostility toward Israel if the latter knows how to deal with it. But\nthere will be tension if Israel continues to follow extreme policies,\nwhich it will under the current leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThe Palestinians must achieve their right to establish their own state\non their land. This right has been recognized by almost everyone\nexcept a minority of extremists in Israel, led by Netanyahu. Free and\ndemocratic Arab countries won’t shrink from supporting this\nPalestinian right under any circumstances. Muslims will not give up\non East Jerusalem, either. Arab regimes have been weak in the past.\nDemocracy will strengthen them, but also add reason to Arab\ngovernance.

Egyptians\nunder a democratic regime will be seeking better living standards,\nbetter laws to govern the country and more rights as citizens. They\nwon’t be pressing their government to fight Israel; on the contrary,\nthey want a stable economy where things will be better for future\ngenerations. But Israel may aggravate the situation by electing\nextremists and following extreme policies. This will strengthen the\nhands of the hawks in the Arab world.
