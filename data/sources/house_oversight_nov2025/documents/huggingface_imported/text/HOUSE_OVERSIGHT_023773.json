He had us keep a writing journal and was just\nexcellent at helping me understand what was so personal to me\nthat others wouldn't be able to connect (or perhaps just plain\nsappy romantic drivel!) and what was “strong” and pertinent to\neveryone.

Many teachers\nknow how to mentor but often they are not given the opportunity\nor don’t take the time to do it.
