The\ncommission’s report, leaked to the New York Times, found that the\nIsraelis had indeed used excessive force but that the Gaza embargo\nwas legal.\n\nOn the Israeli side, hard-line foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman at\nevery turn tried to prevent a negotiated outcome from being finalized.\nTurks did not make it easier either by taking inflexible positions that\nmade it hard for the Israelis to apologize. As I understand it, in\nDecember 2010, the two sides had come close to an agreement: Israel\nwould apologize and provide compensation.
