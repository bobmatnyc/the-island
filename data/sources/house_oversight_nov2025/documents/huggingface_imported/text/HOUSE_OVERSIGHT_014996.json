The hedge expires out\nof the money, while SPX has returned 8.7% for the period\n\nThe reflation trade has slowed down and the market is in a holding pattern. The long Apr-17 call\nexpires in-the-money, and the short Dec-17 call still has time value\n\nThe call spread still has value due to elevated vol and vol-of-vol and we collect the premium on\nthe expired short OTM put\n\nThe trade benefited from the rise in post-event volatility relative to pre-event volatility\n\nThe option expired\nSingle stock option expired in-the-money despite a 1.4% decline in the HSCEI\n\nSingle stock option expired in-the-money despite a 1.4% decline in the HSCEI\nSingle stock option expired in-the-money despite a 1.4% decline in the HSCEI\nSX5E has rallied 23.3% since we entered the trade and European political risk abated for now\n\nOption expired; KOSPI2 rallied 8.37% over the period\n\nOption expired; KOSPI2 rallied 8.37% over the period\nClosing the trade post French election; option strikes remain far from the spot level\n\nExpired\nExpired\n\nThe hedge expired out-of-the-money as S&P 500 remained supported\n\nEFA rallied strongly leading into the second round of the French elections but subsequently stalled\nExpired\nOption expired; Both HSI and SPX puts expire out-of-the-money\nOption expired; Nifty failed to move more than the straddle huddle (5%)\n\nOption expired; HSBC is up 6.75% on the back of a strong seasonal rally\nClosing the trade on expiry; Japan market rallied but options remain out of the money\n\nClosing the trade on expiry; Japan market rallied but options remain out of the money\n\nClosing the trade on expiry; Japan market rallied but options remain out of the money\n\nClosing the trade on Jun17 expiry; Global volatility collapsed in 1H2017\n\nRecent political turmoil in Brazil surrounding Temer's presidency caused a slide in the Brazilian\nequity market and the BRL\n\nIn Dec-16, we recommended remaining long equities overlayed with cheap hedges. The hedge\nexpires out of the money, while SPX has returned 10.2% for the period\n\nFollowing the US election and the initial move in rates, XLF rallied and subsequently stalled. In the\nsame period, the defensive sectors played the catch-up trade\n\nConcerns over US tax reform implementation caused small-caps to underperform relative to other\nequity markets, including EM\n\nThe trade captured the recent Tech sector outperformance in a period when Financials lagged\ndriven by lower rates\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.
