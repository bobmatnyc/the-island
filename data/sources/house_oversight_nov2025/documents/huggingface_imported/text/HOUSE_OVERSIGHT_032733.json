[jeevacation@gmail.com]\nSubject: Re:\n\nImportance: — High\n\ni think this is a good point Jeffrey but i do think they are rarely sacrificed—certainly not Saddam or the sadistic\nAssads or Donald\n\nhave you heard that Genghis Khan—for all 1 know a gentle nomadic warrior—left 5 million Y chromosomes in\nhis wake, surviving today?\n\n45% of marriages in Iraq are with first cousins of the doubly paternal kind—father's brother's child and this has\nbeen said to lead to easy fracturing of the country which only a powerful dictator like Saddam could contain\n\nof course \"we\" destroyed the country and it lies in ruins now—one end to the other\nleave tomorrow for Ft Lauderdale and then Sunday on to California\n\nas always, if you have an hour or so i will be there\n\nall best\n\nOn Mon, Mar 19, 2018 at 6:14 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\ni think you might be missing the benefit of the psycopath to the group. he is the defender easily\nsacrificed. but strkes fear in the heart of the other tribes. they are needed as best warriors\n\nOn Sun, Mar 18, 2018 at 11:19 PM, Robert Trivers iii rote:\n\ndear men\n\niam writing you both because i am attaching a still not-quite-complete response to Peter Richerson, a gene-\nculture co-evolutionist—without the genes\n\ni do so because four lines down i tell the \"Gruterites\"—-Gordon Getty's echo chamber—that i have added you\ntwo to the list\n\nso here is your chance to say \"no way\" and 1 will delete that from the message and likewise not ask Gruter's\nassistant to add your names to the list\n\nhaving said that, i find Gordon's missives much less burdensome than those from EDGE and certainly without\nthe egomaniacal nonsense that infects John Brockman—the key is to get the brightest minds in a room and\n\nhave them tell each other what they think is most important—or some such nonsense\n\nneither David nor i can think of a single scientific advance achieved that way—most of what we do is simply\nconcentrated sustained thought directed toward the foundations of a problem\n\ni doubt Jeffrey has made a huge amount of money via the EDGE program\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032733",
