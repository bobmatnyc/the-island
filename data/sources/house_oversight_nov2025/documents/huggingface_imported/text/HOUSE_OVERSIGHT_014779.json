Prior\nuptrends failed at trend line resistance levels; however, this time it broke through. The\ndistance traveled during prior moves include +140bps, +93bps and +108bps. Therefore,\nwe believe this uptrend has room to continue to 55bps (estimated 200wk SMA) by\n1Q2017 and to 75bps in 2017.\nJapanese 30y yields form head and shoulders bottom\nThe rapid decline in 30y JGB yield during 2016 led to a trend exhaustion signal at the\nlows (TD Sequential 13), a rise resulting in the most overbought (higher yield}\nmomentum since 2010 and the formation of a head and shoulders bottom. Provided\nyield remains above 44bps, we could see yield rising to 71 bps and possibly 87bps in\n2017.\nBankof America 2 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead| 16 November 2016 49\nerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014779",
