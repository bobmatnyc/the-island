  "text": "drug use and other destructive temptations. Drug testing is as appropriate\nfor chess players as for shot-putters, or any other competitors who use\ntheir heads as well as their hands.”\n\nAccompanying the television image of a couple of eggs sizzling in a\nfrying pan, the phrase, “This is your brain on drugs” has always carried\nnegative connotations, but apparently General McCaffrey has changed his\nmind about that. He now seems to believe that drugs can actually /mprove\nthe way your brain functions.\n\nThere was an infamous chess player named Alexander Alekhine who\nheld the world championship longer than anybody else. His games often\nhad superb surprise endings, known in chess circles as_ “brilliancies.” For\ninstance, he would checkmate with a pawn move that no sane and sober\nmind could ever imagine. However, he was a notorious alcoholic, and\nMcCaffrey is only referring to illegal drugs.\n\n“Just when | thought I’ d heard it all from McCaffrey,” was the\nreaction of Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the NORML (National\nOrganization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) Foundation. “Drug\ntesting for chess players?
