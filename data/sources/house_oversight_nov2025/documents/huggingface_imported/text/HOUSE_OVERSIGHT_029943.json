  "text": "Article 3.\n\nAl-Ahram Weekly\n\nNew paradigm in Palestine\n\nMahmoud Musa and Awni Sarrif\n\n30 June - 6 July 2011 -- All roads to a meaningful settlement of the\nArab Israeli conflict are at a dead end. Nevertheless, should two\nstates be established in historic Palestine, bloody conflict will persist.\nPutting aside disputes over natural resources, Israel will remain a\nZionist supremacist state with a clear arsenal that can turn the entire\nMiddle East into an inferno, and the enclaved improvised Palestinian\nArab entity cannot exist without aid from the outside world. There\nwill be democracy for the Jewish people of Israel, with second and\nperhaps third class citizenships for all others.\n\nThe Palestinians, as the last twenty years have shown, will be ruled\nunder an autocratic corrupt police state. The plight of the Palestinian\nrefugees living outside the new Palestine will continue and their right\nto return totally forgotten. The Jordanian regime may collapse to\nbecome the alternate home leading to civil wars between the\nindigenous Jordanians and the Palestinians. It is also reasonable to\nassume that, in order to preserve the Jewish identity of Israel, another\nNakba will befall the Israeli Arabs who may be relocated to areas in\nthe West Bank.\n\nThere can only be one solution -- one state where Palestinians and\nIsraelis alike are equal citizens in a nation that belongs indeed to the\nMiddle East. Three conditions must be met for the new state to take\nhold: dissolving the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Hamas\nGovernment in Gaza, the rejection of Zionism by the Israelis, and the\nreturn of the Palestinian refugees. These can only be accomplished\nunder the auspices of the United Nations (UN).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029943",
