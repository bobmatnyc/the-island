  "text": "satisfaction and optimism around the world, and reflected positively on all the nations including the UAE,\nwhich has always had a strong, multi-potential and diverse economy.\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nThe Federal Government has taken swift action to deal with the crisis, but many\nobservers say that these actions are not sufficient to help the UAE, and Dubai in\nparticular, to be free of the crisis?\n\nThe actions that we took at the Federal Government were really fast, well thought-out to respond to the issues\nand to overcome the negative effects of the global crisis. Having said that, our economy has shifted from the\ncrisis mode to the solution. Of course, we are monitoring and following up our situation and the development of\nall the economic sectors through federal and local specialized committees, just as we follow developments in\nthe global economy and international markets. We thank God; most of the indicators seem positive now and\n\ncall for optimism. However, should we face future developments further actions, then we won’t sit back.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nWhen Du bai launched the $20 billion bonds and the UAE Central Bank subscribed in it\nwith $10 billion, it was interpreted as help from Abu Dhabi to Dubai to get out of the\ncrisis. How do you evaluate this action by the UAE Central Bank, and what about the\nsecond tranche of the bonds, which would another $10 billion?\n\nWhen Dubai launched the $20 billion bonds and the UAE Central Bank subscribed in it with $10 billion, it was\ninterpreted as help from Abu Dhabi to Dubai to get out of the crisis. How do you evaluate this action by the\nUAE Central Bank, and what about the second tranche of the bonds, which would another $10 billion?It seems\nthat people are not aware of the life realities in the United Arab Emirates. Well, I welcome this interpretation\nbecause it emphasizes the depth of ties among the Emirates and ensures the strength of our Central Bank and its\nconfidence in Dubai’s economy.\n\nWe have announced bonds totaling $20 billion, raised half of it as a public offering, then the Central Bank\nsubscribed to the full amount; we will pay an annual interest rate of 4 percent annually on the five-year\ncoupons. What we put forward, meets our needs at this stage. Should we need the second part — that is, $10\nbillion -- we will then announce it to the public; we know that it will be of interest to many.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nThere are talks that Dubai would be selling few20state owned companies and that Abu\nDhabi will be its partner in many projects in place or under implementation. What is the\ntruth in this?\n\nThese rumors and speculations turned into news and headlines in several prominent international newspapers.\nRest assured that between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, there is no buying and selling. Everything in Dubai belongs to\nAbu Dhabi and Dubai and the rest of the UAE, and all that is in Abu Dhabi belongs to Dubai and Abu Dhabi,\nand the rest of the UAE. Let me remind you about what The President, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed\nAl Nahyan, said last month about this matter. He said that the impact of the current global financial crisis on the\nnational economy of the United Arab Emirates has been misunderstood and exaggerated. He said that the\nrelationship between members of the UAE Federation has been misrepresented.\n\n“We are ... one strong, coherent body.
