  "text": "I’m not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he\neventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West\nreally have to look at what he’s talking about as far as traditionalism goes — particularly\nthe sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism — and I happen to think\nthat the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think\nstrong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors,\nand that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States,\nand I think it’s what can see us forward.\n\nYou know, Putin’s been quite an interesting character. He’s also very, very, very\nintelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s playing very strongly to social\nconservatives about his message about more traditional values, so I think it’s something\nthat we have to be very much on guard of. Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin\nand his cronies are really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to\nexpand. However, I really believe that in this current environment, where you're facing a\npotential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation — I’m not saying\nwe can put it on a back burner — but I think we have to deal with first things first.\nQuestioner: One of my questions has to do with how the West should be responding to\nradical Islam. How, specifically, should we as the West respond to Jihadism without\nlosing our own soul? Because we can win the war and lose ourselves at the same time.\nHow should the West respond to radical Islam and not lose itself in the process?\nBannon: From a perspective — this may be a little more militant than others. I think\ndefinitely you’re going to need an aspect that is [unintelligible]. I believe you should take\na very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other\naspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that’s fine.\n\nIf you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I\nbelieve that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think\nthey kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places... It\nbequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West.\n\nAnd I would ask everybody in the audience today, because you really are the movers and\ndrivers and shakers and thought leaders in the Catholic Church today, is to think, when\npeople 500 years from now are going to think about today, think about the actions you’ve\n\ntaken — and I believe everyone associated with the church and associated with the Judeo-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029082",
