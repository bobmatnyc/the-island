This event is at the apartment of the chairman of the YIVO board. My plan had been to take the 4 or 5 shuttle
and cab right here

Jeffrey,

For taping in Cambridge? For breakfast and taping at my house. Depends on what woody is up for. My ideal
would be a 1/2 hour-40 minute conversation, but we could do a quick taping in 15 minutes ...my team can be
ready

And , just to remind,could also come to do taping in ny on 24th because I'm coming to New York the evening
of 23rd fora YIVO event--to which you would both be most welcome I'm sure (YTVO is the largest collection

of materials from Jewish Eastern Europe)

Absolutely. 23rd is great. I teach my seminar that day at 1 but could tape in the morning or after class--in
my office (very private), or at the Harvardx studios (less) or in the Woodberry poetry room (the nicest place).
. If Woody wanted, we could bring some students into the taping or just do the two of us...

Woody is absolutely welcome to come to the seminar, of course
