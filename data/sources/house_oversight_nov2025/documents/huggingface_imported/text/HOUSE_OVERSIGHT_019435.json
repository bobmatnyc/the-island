As my own clientele have come to realize,\neducation in the 21st century is not just something you do before you become an adult but a modality of experience that\nempowers you throughout your entire life. No reason for schools to own the entire market for those kinds of experiences.\nBut | expect the most enterprising schools — especially those with great or underused physical inventory — to partner with\norganizations that now have the opportunity to rethink themselves for the education market. In the meantime, it may be time\nto reassess the MOOC acronym to make the opportunities more obvious. “Massive Online Offline Communities” seems\nmore like it. And unlike the online communities of the past, these communities are learning communities, driven by the new\nlifelong modality of transformative experience. Expect a land grab for branding and positioning. The disruption in education\nis just beginning, and the players are just becoming visible.\n\nBack to top\nWomen and Children — Full text articles\n\nIndian Police Arrest Suspects in Two Gang Rapes\nSean Mclain and Khushita Vasan — Wall Street Journal\n\nIndian police Sunday were holding 10 men suspected of involvement in two highly publicized gang-rape cases—one in\nurban Mumbai, the other in rural Jnarkhand state—highlighting India's struggles with sexual violence.\n\nIn Jharkhand in eastern India, police said they had detained five suspects in connection with the rape of a policewoman by a\ngroup of men who had set up a roadblock on a highway. The attack occurred Thursday, but wasn't reported to police until\nFriday, they said.\n\nFive other men were in custody Sunday in the Mumbai case, in which a 22-year-old magazine intern taking photographs of\ndilapidated buildings was assaulted Thursday in an abandoned textile mill in the city, police said.\n\nThe attacks come as the trial of five people accused in the December gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student ona\nDelhi bus entered its final phase. That crime sparked nationwide demonstrations and prompted the government to\nintroduce harsher penalties for crimes against women.\n\nProtesters took to the streets of Mumbai on Friday to decry the assault on the magazine intern in a city that has a reputation\nas arelatively safe place for women. In 2012, the incidence of rape in the Western Indian metropolis was about half the\n\nnational rate, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.\n\n\"I've always felt much safer in Mumbai compared to other Indian cities,\" said Sanika Prabhu, a television producer from\nMumbai. \"After this incident, | feel like | don't recognize this city anymore.\"\n\nMumbai police said the magazine intern was with a 21-year-old male companion when she was attacked Thursday. The\nassailants tied his hands with his belt and raped the woman from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., an official at N.M. Joshi police station\nsaid. Medical tests confirmed the rape, he said.\n\nUnder Indian law, rape victims cannot be named in media accounts.\n\nThere were 24,915 reported rapes in India in 2012, according to the National Crime Records Bureau, including 233 in\nMumbai. The victims in almost half the Mumbai cases were between 14 and 18 years old.\n\nActivists say the number of rapes is much higher, as many go unreported. India also has a poor record on convictions, with\nonly around a quarter of alleged rapists convicted in 2010.\n\nIn Jharkhand, police said the rape of the police constable occurred at around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, as she and her\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019435",
