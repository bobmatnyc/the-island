  "text": "800\n\nDismiss, Ex. 16 (Prince Turki, “Allied\nAgainst Terrorism,” September 17, 2002,\nWashington Post, editorial in which Prince\nTurki explains the Saudis’ practice of shar-\ning information regarding Osama bin Lad-\nen and al Qaeda with the CIA and states\nthat al Qaeda also targeted the Kingdom);\nExs. 3, 5, 6 (fatwas issued by Osama bin\nLaden and Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman\ntargeting Americans and expressing ex-\ntreme bitterness toward the Saudi Royal\nfamily). Prince Sultan argues that Plain-\ntiffs blur the distinction between charities\nhe is on record of supporting, ITRO and\nWAMY, and those he is not, Al Haramain\nand MWL. See supra note 20. Both\nPrinces also distinguish the instant case\nfrom Bowm and other cases cited by the\nPlaintiffs on the basis that groups that\nthey are alleged to have supported were\nnot designated as terrorist organizations\nby the United States government. See\nBown I, 291 F.3d at 1002 (noting Hamas\nwas designated a terrorist organization by\nPresident Clinton in 1995 and by the Sec-\nretary of State in 1997); see also Consoli-\ndated Plaintiffs’ Opp. to Prince Sultan’s\nMotion to Dismiss at 16-17 (citing Flatow,\n999 F.Supp. at 18 (holding Iran, a state\nsponsor of terrorism, liable as provider of\nmaterial support to terrorist organization\nPalestine Islamic Jihad pursuant to 18\nU.S.C. § 1605(@)\\()); Smith v. Islamic\nEmirate of Afghanistan, 262 F.Supp.2d\n217, 282 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (granting default\njudgment against Iraq, a designated state\nsponsor of terror, after plaintiffs demon-\nstrated it provided material support to\nOsama bin Laden and al Qaeda)); Consoli-\ndated Plaintiffs’ Opp. to Prince Turki’s\nMotion to Dismiss at 8 (same).\n\nAlthough they did not involve New York\nlaw, the Court agrees that Halberstam\nand Boim are instructive. In Halberstam,\nthe defendant enjoyed an extravagant life-\nstyle made entirely possible by her long-\nterm live-in boyfriend’s regular burglaries.\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nThe court concluded that she had to know\nof his criminal activities because she acted\nas a money launderer for her boyfriend’s\nstolen metals business. Halberstam, 705\nF.2d at 486-88. The court found the de-\nfendant was so close to the illegal activity\nthat she had to be aware of her role in it.\nId. at 486. In Boim, the court denied the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss because the\ncomplaint contained specific factual allega-\ntions tying the defendants to Hamas. For\nexample, one defendant entity allegedly\nemployed an individual designated as a\nterrorist affiliated with Hamas, another\nentity admitted providing funds to Hamas,\ntwo individual defendants had documented\nand admitted ties to Hamas, and numer-\nous links existed between the individual\nterrorist defendants and the entity defen-\ndants. Bown [, 127 F.Supp.2d at 1006-\n1008. Unlike Hamas in Bowm, none of the\norganizations the Princes are alleged to\nhave supported in an official capacity were\ndesignated a sponsor of terrorism at the\ntime of the alleged contributions. In fact,\nonly BIF and certain branches of Al Hara-\nmain have since been designated. See\nExec. Order No. 18224 (designating BIF\n(November 19, 2002) and branches of Al\nHaramain (Bosnia, Somalia on March 11,\n2002; Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, Tanza-\nnia on January 22, 2004; Afghanistan, Al-\nbania, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the Nether-\nlands on June 2, 2004)). Thus, pursuant\nto Boim, the Plaintiffs would have to al-\nlege specific facts showing that the\nPrinces knew or should have known that\nthe charities they supported were actually\nfronts for al Qaeda. See Burnett I, 274\nF.Supp.2d at 106.\n\n[25-27] Plaintiffs have pleaded al Qae-\nda’s repeated, public targeting of the Unit-\ned States. They have not, however, plead-\ned facts to support an inference that the\nPrinces were sufficiently close to the ter-\nrorists’ illegal activities to satisfy Halber-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017865",
