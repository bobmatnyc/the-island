I would like to see if\n\nI can clarify my understanding.\n\nIn the motion to dismiss, I concluded, I think, that\n\nwhat was at issue was the truth or falsity of the plaintiff's\n\nallegations concerning sexual abuse and the activities of the\n\ndefendant. I think that's my sense of my own opinion.\nYesterday, we were discussing the redactions of the\n\nintervention motion. I got the sense, perhaps wrongly, that\n\nthe plaintiff's position was that the defamation was the truth\n\nor falsity of the statements relating to the defendant.\nPeriod. Am I correct?\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: You are, your Honor, in that the\n\nstatements about the defendant to be clear, because one of\n\nthe allegations is, of course, she was a madam and a\n\ncoconspirator with Epstein -- do involve Epstein.\n\naid al\n\nir]\n\nCOURT: Listen. Leave the pejorative out. Okay?\nPlease.\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Sure.\n\nTHI\n\nGl\n\nCOURT: Simply because I'm trying to come to\ngrips, obviously, with the scope of this case, which is a real\n\nissue, obviously. So is it you are restricting your claim to\n\nthe truth and falsity of the statements about Maxwell?\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Yes, that is the case, your Honor.
