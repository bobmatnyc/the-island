  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nMarsha Clark without underwear\n\nMarsha Clark may not have been the most sophisticated prosecutor I ever encountered, but she\ncertainly was among the most resourceful, employing everything she had to her advantage. In the\nOJ Simpson case, Johnny Cochran was about to make his closing argument. As we walked to the\nlecturn, Marsha Clark went over to him and whispered, “when you’re up there, I want you think\nof only one thing: I’m not wearing any underwear.” When Johnny Cochran told me this story, I\nwas skeptical. So I called Marsha Clark and asked her. She told me, “Absolutely true.” I asked,\n“which part of it was true: the fact that you told him you weren’t wearing any underwear or that\nyou weren’t, in fact, wearing any underwear?” She replied, “That’s one thing you’ll never know.”\n\n375\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017462",
