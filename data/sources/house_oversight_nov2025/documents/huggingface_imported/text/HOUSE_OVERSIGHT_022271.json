  "text": "After hosting a few successful events, WE are planning a bigger and better event in\nfall. In fact, WE are making a statement that women should not be judged based\non their external beauty and should be rewarded for their intellect and hard work.\n\nThe majority of our society still emphasizes the importance of female physical\nqualities, such as beauty, body, or photogenic skills. Miss USA, the famous Beauty\nPageant previously owned by Donald Trump, until this summer required the\nparticipants to pose in a swimsuit paired with high heels. Effective this year, the\nshow will abolish the bikini contest. We think that it is time to take one step\nfurther and to finally start rewarding women for their mind, hard work, and\ncreativity.\n\nOur idea is to host a “Beauty Pageant” for female entrepreneurs and to have the\ntop five finalists do a five-minute pitch in front of our jury. The finalists will not\nonly get a money prize, but also receive a significant exposure to investors and\nmedia. We are hoping to get at least a few hundred applications as the application\nis completely free. Female founders should have equal opportunities and\nresources to their male counterparts. We hope that our event will encourage other\nfemale entrepreneurs and help them advance in their careers.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022271",
