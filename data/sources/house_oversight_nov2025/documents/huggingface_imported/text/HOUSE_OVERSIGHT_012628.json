We need to resolve the attorney issue today. It has been\nweeks since execution of the contract, and there is no need for further delay.\n\nAs far as the five attorney names that we will be providing, I propose Bert\nOcariz, Katherine Ezell at Podhurst Orseck, Stuart Grossman, Ed Rogers, and\nWalter Cobath.\n\nIf you would like to use the same Special Master to resolve fees disputes as\nwell as to handie the selection of the attorney, I would recommend that we use\nretired llth Circuit Judge Joseph Hatchett instead of Judge Davis because of\nJudge Davis's heaith problems. (No one has contacted Judge Hatchett yet, but\none of the District Judges in Miami mentioned him as a good choice.)\n\nI am available for a conference call between 9:00 and 10:00, and between 3:15\nand 6:00. Please call me on my cell and let me know which of\nthose times works best for you.\n\nThank you.\n\nFrom: Jay Lefkowitz\n\nSent: Wed 10/3/2007 4:26 PM\n\nTo: Villafana, Ann Marie C. (USAFLS)\n\nSubject: Re: Proposed Letter to Special Master\n\nMarie - I, too, am interested in speed. But I really need to go over this and\nthen discuss with Jeffrey. So please do not send this to any Special Master\n’ before we discuss.the next steps. ;\n\nThanks -- Jay\n\n10/03/2007 04:24 PM\n\nTo\n\n\"Jay Lefkowitz\" iy\n\ncc\nSubject\nProposed Letter to Special Master\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012628",
