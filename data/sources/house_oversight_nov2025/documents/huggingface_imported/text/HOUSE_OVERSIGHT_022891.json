  "text": "allegations, he notes, was brought by the imprisoned\nRothstein’s former partner, Brad Edwards, part and\nparcel of the settIment industry that has grown up\naround him.\n\nThis new chapter relies entirely on the testimony\nand the memoir—excerpts of which were published by\nthe Daily Mail—of Virginia Roberts, who claims that\nGhislaine Maxwell met her, when she was 17, at Donald\nTrump’s Palm Beach resort and got her a job in the\nEpstein house, which she held for several years,\ntraveling in the Epstein entourage. It is Roberts—who\nrefused to cooperate with the FBI’s 2007 investigation\nof Epstein—who has propounded the “sex slave”\nnarrative.
