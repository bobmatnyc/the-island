  "text": "300 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nTRY THE PAPER CLIP TEST AGAIN!\n\nDivergent thinking is rarely the final goal; it is rather a jumping off\npoint for the creation of something new, like a solution to a mathematical\npuzzle, a painting, or a novel invention. The exercises allow us to\nexplicitly see one of the early creative steps — idea generation before the\npruning step. But most creative people often just create, they don’t follow\na scripted process. The term ‘the creative process’ is a great misnomer.\nThere is no process that actually creates. Process merely puts us in the\nright frame of mind to do so. Processes are useful for framing a problem\nand ensuring we have all the right tools at our disposal: good crayons,\nsome nice art paper, a hot cup of coffee. But process must be put to one\nside at the moment of actual creation.\n\nConvergent Thinking\n\nConvergent thinking is the opposite of divergent thinking. It focuses\non discovering the final solution to a problem rather than generating\nprecursor ideas. Some creative people only use this method, avoiding\nlaborious processes such as brainstorming.\n\nTests of skill for convergent thinking generally pose puzzles where\nthere is only one correct answer, but one that requires a non-linear step.\nHere’s a really simple convergent thinking puzzle to try. It only requires\na piece of paper and pen. Draw a circle on a piece of paper with a dot in\nthe center. It should look like this. Do NOT take the tip of the pen off the\npaper until you are finished.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015990",
