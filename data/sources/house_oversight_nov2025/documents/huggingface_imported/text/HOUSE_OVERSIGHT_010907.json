  "text": "Jeffrey Epstein. Defendant spends over five (5) pages discussing the federal action and eleven\n(11) of his subpoena Requests (Jane Doe Subpoena 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 22 and 24; BSF\nSubpoena 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 and 22) relate to the federal action or Jeffrey Epstein.\nFor example, Request 24 seeks “All documents concerning, relating or referring to your\nassertion that you met former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore and/or Mary\nElizabeth “Tipper” Gore on Little Saint James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.” Defendant\nclaims that this discovery would go to the issue of whether or not Giuffre is telling the truth\nabout Defendant — but that effort at impeachment is clearly collateral at best and fails to address\nthe central issue in this case. That issue is whether the Defendant had any basis to support his\nmedia assault against two lawyers claiming that they fabricated and then publicly filed false\ncharges of criminal conduct on the part of the Defendant. It is the Defendant’s credibility and\nnot the credibility of Giuffre that is the focus of this defamation action. Defendant suggests that\nGiuffre must be a liar because it would be unheard of for one of Epstein’s young girls to have\nmet President Clinton. Quite the opposite is true. There are a number of accounts documenting\nClinton’s regular visits with Epstein. For example, Chauntae Davies recently showed pictures on\nThe Inside Edition program of her travels with other young women in the company of Bill\nClinton and Jeffrey Epstein on Epstein’s plane. See Exhibit 4, ‘Lolita Express’ Masseuse\nReveals Lurid Details from Jeffrey Epstein’s Private Plane For the Rich, Inside Edition, April\n27, 2015. The Epstein flight logs also demonstrate that former President Bill Clinton traveled\nwith Jeffrey Epstein and other young women. See Exhibit 5, The Gauker, January 22, 2015. All\nof that information, while no doubt interesting, is irrelevant to the defamation issue before this\n\nCourt except to the extent it casts doubt on the Defendant’s own credibility.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010907",
