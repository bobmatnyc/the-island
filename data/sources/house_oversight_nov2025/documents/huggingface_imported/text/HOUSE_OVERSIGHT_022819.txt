Thank you Marty,

The questions we wanted to reach out to Mr Epstein for comment are listed below. Feel free to contact me on
a after reviewing. Kind regards - Matt

A former employee has told us that Donald Trump attended Mr Epstein's Palm Beach estate on at least two occasions. Does Mr
Epstein recall hosting Donald Trump at that residence?

On one such occasion, it has been suggested to us that Mr Epstein and Donald Trump watched “young girls try on bikinis” while
making comments on the their bodies.” Does Mr Epstein have any comment?

How does Mr Epstein respond to claims that women - some under the legal age of sexual consent - were used as “sex slaves” at his
properties?

A former employee of Mr Epstein has alleged to us that Mr Epstein sexually assaulted her on
numerous occasions. Does Mr Epstein have a comment?

Did or does Mr Epstein have cameras inside rooms at his Palm Beach residence?
