  "text": "207\n\nWhile Kucherena did not arrange an interview with Snowden, as I had hoped, he did\nsomething I considered more important. He confirmed the accuracy of his September 2013c\nassertion that Snowden had brought secret material to Russia; material he had not given to\njournalists in Hong Kong. After what I learned from Cherkashin about the lengths that Russian\nintelligence would go to obtain U.S. communications intelligence secrets, I viewed Snowden’s\naccess to this material to be a crucially important part of the mystery.\n\nAs for Snowden, I would send my questions to Ben Wizner and, if he and Snowden approved\nthem, I would fly back to Moscow. But I decided that I was not going to send money to\nKucherena— or to Snowden.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020359",
