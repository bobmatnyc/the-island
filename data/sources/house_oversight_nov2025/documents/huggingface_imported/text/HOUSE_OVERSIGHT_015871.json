If they match up, you can easily see they are equal in\nnumber. “Look,” I say, “I have the same number of apples as oranges.” This\nmethod is more primitive and does not require the concept of numbers,\nbut it is very useful. If ’m a shepherd I can hold a set of counters in a bag,\none for each sheep. To ensure all my flock are gathered in for the night I\ndrop one counter into the bag as each sheep enters the enclosure. I don't\nneed to give the counters number names.\n\nThe Munduruku tribe, from the Amazon rainforest, have no concept\nof number names beyond five. Their counting system simply goes one,\ntwo, three, four, five, many. Yet this second way of counting allows them\nto function successfully, deciding whether two groups of things have\nthe same number of elements, even if there are more than five of them.\nFor example, if they need to determine if they have enough spears for a\nhunt, each person simply stands next to their spear. If everyone has one,\nthey're ready. If not, then the empty handed Munduruku simply make\none. No need for pesky numbers or mathematics lessons.\n\nThis second way of counting is particularly useful when tackling\ninfinity because we are not sure what infinity is. Treating it the same way\nthe Munduruku treat the number ‘many’ is the safest thing to do. The\nfirst question we would like to answer is whether all infinite things are\nthe same.\n\niil i\n\nSpears and Hunters\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015871",
