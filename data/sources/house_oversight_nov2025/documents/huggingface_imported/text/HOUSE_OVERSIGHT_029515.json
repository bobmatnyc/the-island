  "text": "mean this is coming from a Nobel laureate who discovered a particle, you know. So I\nended up where I began, which is non-dualism, that there is only consciousness.\n\nMatt: Isn’t that idealism?\nDeepak: Idealism comes out of non-dualism.\n\nMatt: So there are two types of monism [non-dualism]. There’s materialism and then there\nis idealism. [Each holds that] there’s only matter or there’s only consciousness.\n\nDeepak: Okay then we can say idealism is closest to non-duality. They don’t use that word\nin the East. Let’s go for lunch. [We head downstairs. ]\n\nDeepak: With idealism one usually relates to Plato in the West or to Bishop Berkeley and\nall those guys, you know. But basically, what idealism espouses, it’s mental. But non-\ndualism says even mental is a construct. When you say mental you have words. As soon as\nyou have a word for an experience it’s no longer fundamental.\n\nMatt: Non-dualism is a construct too.\nDeepak: If I have to use words, yes.\nMatt: There’s no getting away from constructs.\n\nDeepak: No, there is a way of getting away from constructs. It’s called transcendence. Shut\nup and just be.\n\nMatt: We never stop filtering experience—\n\nDeepak: Every experience is filtered through given constructs. There is no getting away\nfrom it. But then we start looking at consciousness—let’s find our table. [We find our table. ]\n\nDeepak Chopra MD\n\nChopra Foundation\nJiyo\nChopra Center for Wellbeing\n\nwww.discoveringyourcosmicself.com\n\nae,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029515",
