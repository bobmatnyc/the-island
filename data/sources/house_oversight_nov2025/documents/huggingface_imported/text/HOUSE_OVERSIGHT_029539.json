Bush dead set \nagainst stem cell research, California just went ahead 1> \nand did it. Voters made stem cell research a state \nconstitutional right, and endorsed $3 billion in bond \nsales for 10 years to cement the deal. CIRM, the \nCalifornia Institute for Regenerative Medicine created \nunder Proposition 71, has become a world center for \nstem cell research, and its president is Australian Alan \nTrounson, a pioneer in in vitro fertilization. As \nProposition 71 approaches its 10-year anniversary, \nTrounson offers a prognosis. \nIt's been almost 10 years since California funded \nwhat may be the world's biggest stem cell research \nprogram. What are you up to? \nadvertisement \nFREE CHECKED BAG \nGROUP 1 BOARDING \nDOUBLE MILES OPPORTUNITY \nctri. I AmericankrOnAlevartageres \nL I_______ \nWe are working hard to get six or seven projects to clinical trials. We have more than 70 [total] \nprograms moving [toward] clinical trials. It's a lot of work to chaperon. \nI'll give you three examples: one, linking genetics, or genomics work, to stem cells, integrating the \ntwo. We're going to create a center in California that will bring a lot of [genetics] studies and clinical \nwork to a new level. \nSecondly, we've set up a structure for banking the 3,000 cell lines from \"induced pluripotent stem \ncells\" that we turn into the equivalent of embryonic stem cells. We call them IPS cells. You take a \nskin cell or blood cell and convert it to the equivalent of an embryonic stem cell. \nWe've also taken samples from patients with complex diseases, and we're banking these so scientists \ncan \"interrogate\" these diseases — like heart disease, Alzheimer's, blindness. We are targeting a range \nof conditions — autism, cerebral palsy — for which we have scant understanding of causes and major \ndrivers. This is material for long-term research studies. \nhup://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/cornmentary/la-oe-0529-morrison-trounson-201305... 5/29/2013 \n\fAlan Trounson, California's Dr. Stem Cell -- latimes.com Page 2 of 4 \nWhat we're doing is meaningful. Somebody with cancer may have a better treatment. Parkinson's \npatients might be in a clinical trial around 2016, 2017. \nAre Californians getting enough bang for their buck? \nI think we're way ahead of what people predicted. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of time to do this. I think \nwe're hurrying carefully. \nWhat else? \nI'm intending to set up a network of stem cell clinics in California in the next couple of years, to make \ntreatments available as clinical trials or as registered treatments for patients. I'm going to ask the \n[CIRM] board for about $70 million to get that set up. It will make California a go-to place for stem \ncell therapies. I want to make sure it's part of our medical fabric. \nAn Oregon scientist reports that he has cloned human stem cell lines. Is Oregon doing \nsomething different from California? \nThe one thing that's different is that we can't compensate women adequately for donating eggs [as a \nsource for creating a particular type of stem cell]. We can pay for the cost of drugs but not for the time \nand inconvenience. So that really does limit the number of women who would like to donate eggs to \nresearch, and that's a handicap. I think it would be very useful to develop those cell lines. \nThe words \"cloning\" and \"human\" together set off alarm bells for some people. \n[Under Proposition 71] we can't do any reproductive cloning. We can't do it and we shouldn't do it — \nnone of us wants to do that — but we would like to make those cell lines. \nIs stem cell research highly competitive now, as it was in the 1980s, when you were beginning \nyour work? \nI don't think it's very competitive at all. There's a little bit of competition between California and \nHarvard, but that will always be the case, I suspect. What's important with [California's] $3 billion is \nthat it's taken away a lot of the silliness of the competition — that you hold your data and you don't \nshow anyone and you wait until you [get it published] in a journal. In Australia, there's very few funds \nfor this kind of work and so it's extremely competitive — you don't know what others are doing even \nin the same laboratory. That's not the case in California. People are collaborating, and that's why we're \nmoving so fast because we work together. Scientists like to reach out to other scientists. \nCould embryonic stem cells become unnecessary because other cells can be just as adaptable? \nMaybe longer term. IPS cells have a very strong memory of what they were, whether they were a \nblood cell or a skin cell. Embryonic stem cells don't. We have to find out whether IPS cells can [really \nadapt] or whether they'll be poor relatives of the embryonic stem cell. Embryonic stem cells are being \nused for therapy, but IPS cells are being taken from patients with different diseases to interrogate \nthose diseases. They're not therapeutic at this time. \nWhat surprises have you encountered? \nI'm surprised all the time. That you can actually create a cure for HIV/AIDS with stem cells — that's \nin clinical trials [in Denmark] now. That we found how to jump a skin cell to a pancreatic cell or a \nhup://www.latimes.cominews/opinion/conunentary/la-oe-0529-morrison-trounson-201305... 5/29/2013 \n\fAlan Trounson, California's Dr. Stem Cell -- latimes.com Page 3 of 4 \ncardiac muscle cell. Every month comes a new surprise, tumbling toward totally different medicine \nthat we'll have in 30 or 40 years' time. \nThis work is still controversial. Your team in Australia created the technique that has allowed 5 \nmillion in vitro fertilization babies to be born worldwide. But you were still called a \"baby \nmurderer.\" Astrophysicists don't get that kind of reaction. \nIn the surveys I've seen across the U.S., you get 70% or 80% of people very much in favor [of stem \ncell and IVF work]. If we get cures or treatments for some of these debilitating diseases. which is \ngoing to happen over the next four or five years, people will embrace what's necessary to help a \nParkinson's patient or someone who's got Type I diabetes. I'm not afraid of what some small sector \nfeels outrage about. It's their right, but it's not the majority feeling. \nHave you faced such personal criticism here? \nNot really. Last year I was invited to the Vatican to present a paper, but when I sent in a summary of \nwhat I was going to say, they decided not to have it. They sent a check to the treasurer of California \nand the treasurer rang us up and said, \"What the heck is this check from the Vatican for?\" It was for \nthe inconvenience! \nWill California own patents from the research? \nI expect there's a lot of intellectual property with some of these [treatments] that will be really big \nreturns for California. But it'll take some time; the so-called blockbuster treatments will take 10 years \nor more. Gov. [Arnold] Schwarzenegger pointed a finger at me and said, \"We're going to give you the \nopportunity to deliver this, but understand it's a 25-year gig.\" The feds put $3.8 billion into the human \ngenome project and the return from that, according to a study, is about $1,400 for every dollar. \nThe big story about CIRM last year was its conflict-of-interest protocols. What's being done? \nThe [national] Institute of Medicine gave CIRM management strong positives. They had issues on \nconflict of interest. They felt if the [schools represented by] deans of medicine on the board were the \nrecipient of CIRM [grants], they were potentially in a conflict of interest. The board decided to take \naway the [grant-making] vote for those [members, at least temporarily]. They also had a view that if \nthe patient advocates [on the board] were strongly advocating for [research for] a disease, that was \nanother kind of conflict. They [changed] some patient advocate roles in some grant selection process. \nI didn't see this as a problematic issue, but from the point of view of the Institute of Medicine, it didn't \nlook right, and I can understand that. Much has been done to correct that. \nYou and your wife got married so that she could come here and work. \nWe didn't really feel it was necessary; we'd been together 20 years and have two lovely boys. but she \ncouldn't come to America without being married to me. She's a scientist — not a stem cell scientist — \nbut [once she got here] she couldn't work at universities in California because of [potential CIRM] \nconflicts of interest. So she's back in Australia, doing her work and loving it. but it's not optimum. But \nthis is an important job which I promised to do. \nDo you get letters from people with diseases asking for help? \nAll the time. I try to be supportive and send them to talk to the best people in that area. There would \nbe dozens a week who write to me. \nhttp://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-0529-morrison-trounson-201305... 5/29/2013 \n\fAlan Trounson, California's Dr. Stem Cell -- latimes.com Page 4 of 4 \nYou have a heart condition; will this research one day benefit you? \nI've got atrial fibrillation; I don't think it's going to help that. But I have a brother who has HIV/AIDS, \nand my mum died of lung disease. \nWhat do you hear from your colleagues around the world about what California's doing? \nThey always say, \"You've got the best job in the world. How did California do this?\" That's \nCalifornia. California is a can-do place, and when they want something, they stand up and do it. Many \nof [my colleagues] want to come to California. It's just a wonderful place. You could sail it off the \ncoast of America and it would be the most wonderful country in the world. \npatt.morrison(i4latimes.com. \nFollow Patt Morrison on Twitter apattmlatimes \nThis interview was edited and excerpted from a taped transcript.
