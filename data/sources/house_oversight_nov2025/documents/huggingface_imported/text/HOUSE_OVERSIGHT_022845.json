  "text": "scale. In fact, it used to be that the rich, reaching a certain point of philanthropy,\nmerely hoped to help make the world a better place, now they want to change the\nworld. Rockefeller and Carnegie were, as examples of social-engineering\nphilanthropy, unique. They alone had such resources and will. Now you have\nlegions of people who have to give away vastly larger amounts than Rockefeller or\nCarnegie had at their disposal, or might even have imagined.\n\n“Except that it’s actually hard to give away this kind of wealth, without the\nalways accompanied , unintended consequences, that can cause more problems\nthan you’re solving.”\n\nEpstein’s long-time business thesis is that the rich know little about the\nessence of money. They may know about generating it in their own businesses, but\nthe great sums that result ,demand an entirely different sort of an intellectual\ndiscipline. The Forbes 400, says Epstein, not immune to still exhibiting an\namount of wonder, increased their wealth by over $500 billion last year, meaning,\nin effect, that on average every Forbes-list billionaire increased their wealth by\nmore than a billion only in one year. And, points out the 62-year-old Epstein, they\nwill almost all be dead in 40 years, most well before that, meaning $4.2 trillion,\ncompounding everyday, will have to be eventually change hands. “So, to\nunderstand the future, what you have to begin to do is follow the money, not in\nWatergate-like terms backwards, as in who has gotten it, but forwards to where it\nwill go and who will get it.”\n\nEpstein can find himself echoing aspects of Thomas Piketty on the inequities\nof the accumulation of wealth (“the divide is between people with assets, which\nappreciate, and people without assets, who fail to advance—that is, of course, the\nmiracle of compounded interest”), except for the fact that Epstein, knowing the\nrich, understands a curious point that Piketty doesn’t: “Nobody, nobody, wants to\ngive it all to their children. Everybody now has the modern appreciation that one of\nthe curses of great wealth is that it can make your kids weird .”\n\nEpstein’s position in this private allotment of a decent fraction of the U.S.\nGross Domestic Product is not solely as a philanthropist but as a higher sort of\nbanker or guru or brain—a rich whisperer—making him, in addition to rich\nhimself, arguably, among the most influential people you’ ve never heard of.\n\nThough, likely, you have heard of him, but not for his prowess with high\nfinancial abstraction, but for a scandal of such luridness that he is, for a great\nmany,is the new poster child of the lawlessness of privilege, and for a much\nsmaller but elite circle, the poster child for what can happen when you become the\ntarget of a resentful world. He is that Epstein, according to the Daily Mail—among\nhis most frothing-at-the-mouth antagonists—“one of America’s most notorious sex\noffenders.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022845",
