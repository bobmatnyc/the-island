It was\n\nCassell and Edwards versus Alan Dershowitz, with claims going\n\nback and forth. Cassell and Edwards were, of course,\n\nvindicating their own professional interests and their\n\nprofessional reputation responding to the attacks that had been\n\nmade by Mr. Dershowitz, and they chose to settle the case, as\ndid Mr. Dershowitz, for undisclosed financial reasons.\n\nAnd also, from the fact I think your Honor is now\naware, that there were some witnesses who were not available.\nSarah Ransome has come forward in this case to say that she was\na traffic to Alan Dershowitz in the same way that Ms. Giuffre\nalleges, and that was information that has only recently become\navailable.\n\nThe point is, you have enough business on your hands\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011338",
