  "text": "Clearly the defects in the brain’s wiring that lead to crazy theories may lead to the confirmation of\ntheories that are adopted by rational people. Indeed, the confirmation bias can work in contradictory\nways: confirming not only conspiracy theories but the impulse to reject them in favor of conventional\nwisdom. Can this defect be corrected? Here I am reminded of a Woody Allen’s absolutely brilliant 1996\ncomedy “Everyone Says I Love You,” in which the once-liberal son of a New York liberal family starts\nspouting conservative theories until a doctor solves the problem by restoring the proper flow of oxygen\nto his brain. The movie has a happy ending when the son goes back to spouting his family’s liberal\ntheories. while Mr. Brotherton offers no such remedy to our brain’s defects, he does offer a thought-\nprovoking analysis and an appealing guide to thinking about conspiracies, real and imagined.\n\n—Mr. Epstein most recent book is “The Annals of Unsolved Crimes.” He is currently writing a book about\nEdward Snowden.\n\nhttp: //www.wsj.com/articles/theyre-not-really-out-to-get-you-1450471512\nHappy New Year\nEd\n\nww .edwardjayepstein. com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031461",
