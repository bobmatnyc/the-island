He was just star-fucking. He took his\nbeauty pageant to Russia because he thought Putin was going to be his friend. But Putin\ncouldn’t have cared less, and in the end Trump found himself at the promised gala dinner\nseated on one side next to a guy who looked like he had never used a utensil and on the\nother side Jabba the Hutt in a golf shirt. In other words, Trump—however foolish his\nsucking-up might have been, and however suspicious it might look in hindsight—just\nwanted a little respect.\n\nTheory 5: The Russians, holding damaging information about Trump, were\nblackmailing him. He was a Manchurian Candidate.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nOn January 6, 2017—nearly six months to the day after Foer’s piece was published—the\nCIA, FBI, and NSA announced their joint conclusion that “Vladimir Putin ordered an\ninfluence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.” From the Steele\ndossier, to the steady leaks from the U.S. intelligence community, to testimony and\nstatements from the leadership of U.S. intelligence agencies, a firm consensus had\nemerged. There was a nefarious connection, perhaps an ongoing one, between Trump and\nhis campaign and the Russian government.\n\nStill, this could yet be seen as highly wishful thinking by Trump opponents. “The\nunderlying premise of the case is that spies tell the truth,” said the veteran intelligence\ncommunity journalist Edward Jay Epstein. “Who knew?” And, indeed, the worry in the\nWhite House was not about collusion—which seemed implausible if not farcical—but\nwhat, if the unraveling began, would likely lead to the messy Trump (and Kushner)\nbusiness dealings. On this subject every member of the senior staff shrugged helplessly,\ncovering eyes, ears, and mouth.\n\nThis was the peculiar and haunting consensus—not that Trump was guilty of all that he\nwas accused of, but that he was guilty of so much else. It was all too possible that the\nhardly plausible would lead to the totally credible.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nOn February 13, twenty-four days into the new administration, National Security Advisor\nMichael Flynn became the first actual link between Russia and the White House.\n\nFlynn had really only one supporter in the Trump administration, and that was the\npresident himself. They were best friends during the campaign—buddy movie stuff. Post-\ninauguration, this translated into a total-access relationship. On Flynn’s part, it led to a set\nof misapprehensions that was common inside Trump’s circle: that the president’s personal\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019961",
