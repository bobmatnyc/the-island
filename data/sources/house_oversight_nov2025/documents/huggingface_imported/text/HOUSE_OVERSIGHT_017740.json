  "text": "Page 26 of 52\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *879\n\nThis change helps to implement a victim's right under the CVRA to be treated \"with fairness.\" 19° The rule change is modest.\nRule 18 already requires the court to consider the convenience of the \"witnesses\" in a case. In many cases, of course, the victim\nwill be a witness. But for clarity in those cases, and to account for cases in which the victim will not be a witness, the rule\nshould be amended to refer specifically to victims.\n\nRule 20 - Victims’ Views Considered Regarding Consensual Transfer\nThe Proposal:\nRule 20 should be amended to allow the court to consider the victims' views in any decision to transfer a case as follows:\n\n(a) Consent to Transfer. A prosecution may be transferred from the district where the indictment or information is pending, or\nfrom which a warrant on a complaint has been issued, to the district where the defendant is arrested, held, or present if:\n\n(1) the defendant states in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere and to waive trial in the district where the\nindictment, information, or complaint is pending, consents in writing to the court's disposing of the case in the transferee\ndistrict, and files the statement in the transferee district; and\n\n(2) the United States attorneys in both districts approve the transfer in writing after consultation with any victim. If any victim\nobjects to the transfer, the United States attorney in the transferring district or the victim's attorney shall advise the court where\nthe indictment or information is pending of the victim's concerns.\n\nA similar change should be made to Rule 20(d) regarding transfer of juvenile proceedings.\n[*880]\nThe Rationale:\n\nAs with the previous proposal, this change implements the victim's right under the CVRA to be \"treated with fairness.\" 197\n\nThe procedure for transferring a case for a plea is not constitutionally required, but rather is designed for the convenience of the\ndefendant and the government. !°8 In considering whether such administrative reasons justify a transfer, the concerns of the\nvictim appropriately enter into the balance. For reasons similar to those discussed above in connection with changes regarding\n\nplea procedures, the prosecution would be directed to confer with the victim and to advise the court of any objection to the\n\ntransfer. 199\n\nRule 21 - Victims’ Views Considered Regarding Transfer for Prejudice\nThe Proposal:\nRule 21 should be amended as follows to require consideration of the victim's interest in whether a case should be transferred:\n\n(ec) Victims! Views. The court shall not transfer any proceeding without giving any victim an opportunity to be heard. The court\nshall consider the views of the victim in making any transfer decision.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nRule 21 authorizes the trial judge to transfer a case to avoid prejudice or for the convenience of the parties. The proposed rule\nwould require that the court consider the victim's concerns in making any such transfer decision. Such consideration would\nseem to be part and parcel of protecting the victim's right to be \"treated with fairness.\" In addition, the vicinage provision of\n\n196 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(8) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n197 Td. 3771 (a)(8).\n198 See generally Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure 321, at 357-58.\n\n199 See supra notes 158-174 and accompanying text.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017740",
