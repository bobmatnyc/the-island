  "text": "Virginia Roberts was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited to be a masseuse to Palm Beach hedge fund\n\nmanager Jeffrey Epstein. She was lured into a life of depravity and sexual abuse.\nBY EMILY MICHOT &% | JULIE K. BROWN\n\nIt was Epstein’s contacts with powerful and famous people that first propelled him\ninto the public spotlight. In 2002, he flew former President Bill Clinton, actor\nKevin Spacey, comedian Chris Tucker and others to South Africa on his private jet\nas part of a fact-finding AIDS mission in support of the Clinton Foundation.\n\nBut Epstein, a Clinton donor who contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to\nDemocratic candidates and causes, realized that his Democratic connections\nweren't going to help him in 2006, when the federal prosecutor was Acosta, a\nconservative Republican appointed during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nENTER KENNETH STARR\n\nEpstein’s tactic: hire the most aggressive and politically connected lawyers that his\nmoney could buy.\n\nAt the top of his list: Kenneth Starr, a Republican icon because of his pursuit of\nBill Clinton during the Whitewater investigation, which led to the impeachment\n(but not conviction) of the president after it was revealed he’d had sex with a\nyoung White House intern. Like Acosta, Starr had worked at the prestigious law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis. Epstein also tapped Jay Lefkowitz, also of Kirkland, who\nworked as a domestic policy advisor and later as a special envoy to North Korea\nduring the George W. Bush presidency.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016447",
