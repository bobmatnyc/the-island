They certainly do\ninvest in that.\n\nSo we are left with appealing to people who actually care about\nkids and their education. Money isn’t and shouldn’t be the allure here.\nThis means that the saviors of education will have to be wealthy indi-\nviduals or foundations started by wealthy individuals.\n\nThe health sciences curriculum that we built was funded by the\nEwing Kauffman Foundation. We built it using our not-for-profit com-\npany, Engines for Education. I really believe that no alternative to the\nnonprofit model funded by wealthy people exists. We just have to find\npeople who care about education. They are in short supply, and they\ntypically aren’t the wealthy people who make pronouncements about\neducation, but Iam hopeful that they are out there.\n\nI wouldn’t mind being wrong about anything I have said here. The\nfederal government could get taken over by people who actually care\nabout kids and not votes.\n\nHow do we convince schools to offer these curricula once they\nhave been developed? It won’t be easy. There aren’t that many schools\nrun by people who realize that the system is broken. But they do ex-\nist, however. The real problem is not so much convincing the head of\na private school or the superintendent of a school district. It is more\nabout convincing parents who fundamentally do not understand edu-\ncation, or teachers who have taught what they have always taught and\nreally don’t want to learn new skills.\n\nAnd, in addition, there are all those state standards. The first thing\nthat any school that wants to use our curriculum has to do is to see\nhow they can map what we will teach into their state’s standards. If\nthe state standards specify 2 years of algebra, we are out of luck. If\nthey have vague science standards, we are in better shape. Either way,\nthe state standards, passed by all those brilliant state legislatures that\nknow all there is to know about what should be taught in high school,\ninhibit real change in the system.\n\nSo we need motivated heads of schools or school systems, in states\nthat have flexible standards, where parents who hold views about why\nschool was better in their day do not have to be listened to. Do these\nexist?\n\nSure.\n\nThe last issue is training teachers to mentor. We do this by having\nteachers be students in a curriculum mentored by others who have\nexperience in that curriculum. Mentoring does not come naturally to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023960",
