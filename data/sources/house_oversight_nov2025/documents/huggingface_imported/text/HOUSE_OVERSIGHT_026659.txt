Here's something simple we all can do today...

Diana Chapman Walsh was president of Wellesley College 8 years ago. She recently emailed her former colleagues the
following idea:

Listen Up! The Republicans need to get the message from the majority of Americans that we value and need the benefits
of Obamacare. Here’s how we do that.

On January 23rd, everyone who feels that way (our numbers are legion) sends a note to Donald Trump with a simple
message:

“Don’t make America sick again. Improve Obamacare. Don’t repeal it."

One envelope for every ACA supporter in your household...even if they are under 18 years old.
Just that simple message. Put it in an envelope, and put a stamp on it.

On January 23rd, mail it to:

Pres. Donald Trump

1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,
Washington, DC 20500
