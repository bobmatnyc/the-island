  "text": "Macro: charting the way forward\n\nJean-Michel Saliba\nMLI (UK)\njean-michel.saliba@baml.com\n\nThe Saudi Vision 2030 and National Transformation Plan (NTP) present a\ncomprehensive roadmap for change and augur for committed diversification efforts, in\nour view. Announced reforms can help sustain higher potential growth if fully realized as\nnew sectoral sources of growth are developed. Positively, the NTP borrows elements\nfrom other successful strategic case studies. Still, we find a number of targets\nambitious or unrealistic on the fiscal and diversification fronts, and the sequencing and\ndetails of the fiscal measures are left nebulous.\n\nIn terms of the other pillars of the macro view, namely energy and Fx policy, the NTP\npresents a mixed picture, in our view. Energy policy is likely to be less aggressive, as the\nNTP suggests a constant oil production capacity. To remain consistent with the targeted\ngovernment debt accumulation path, we estimate that oil prices have to average at least\nUS$50/bbI in 2016-20 along with no growth in spending (excluding the additional cost\nof NTP initiatives). Partial implementation could require oil prices of cUS$65/bbl.\n\nFiscal consolidation remains imperative to support the Fx peg, in line with stability and\neconomic imperatives. However, as diversification progresses, the case for increased Fx\nflexibility to support competitiveness could likely gradually take shape. Policy-making\ngrowth-focused plans may conflict with needs to deflate Fx demand in the economy.\n\nTowards better governance\n\nThe comprehensive economic blueprint unveiled by the Saudi Vision 2030 and the\nNational Transformation Plan (NTP) confirms the economic reform credentials of the\ncurrent administration. It is likely to improve government culture, accountability and\ntransparency, in our view. The NTP will be implemented across 24 government bodies\nand has been presented through a number of press conferences with high-level\nministerial presentations. The Governance Framework details steps to institutionalize\nand coordinate implementation through restructuring the government. It proposes a\nnumber of committees and bodies to report to the Council for Economic and\nDevelopment Affairs (CEDA). It also introduces an escalation mechanism to rapidly\nresolve bottlenecks, which could see matters escalated to CEDA in 42 days.\n\nA wide-ranging policy-making reshuffle\n\nIn line with ongoing Saudi Vision 2030 implementation efforts, a wide-ranging\nrestructuring of the Saudi Cabinet and government bodies was announced in May to\ndrive change in the government. King Salman issued 51 Royal Decrees restructuring the\nCabinet, various government bodies and appointing a number of officials into various\ngovernment roles. A statement concurrently issued by the Royal Court suggested these\nchanges are in line with the recently announced Saudi Vision 2030 and aim to support\nits implementation. This follows from the January 2015 restructuring of the bodies\naffiliated to the Council of Ministers, which saw the creation of CEDA and the Council\nfor Political and Security Affairs. We list a few major changes below.\n\nNew Oil Minister represents technocratic experience and policy continuity\n\nThe appointment of Khalid Al-Falih to the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral\nResources is not surprising, given that former Minister of Petroleum and Mineral\nResources Al-Naimi has previously suggested he was approaching retirement due to old\nage. Al-Falih’s appointment continues the tradition of non-Royals heading the Ministry,\nwhile simultaneously holding the Chairmanship role of Saudi Aramco. Furthermore,\naccording to local press, Al-Falih appears close to Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin\nSalman, and his appointment likely confirms the recently assertive Royal influence over\nenergy policy, in our view. New Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Al-\nFalih’s past official pronouncements are consistent with stable Saudi energy policy, in\nour view.\n\nOS merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016113",
