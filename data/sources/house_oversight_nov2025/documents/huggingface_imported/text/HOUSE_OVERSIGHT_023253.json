  "text": "Subject: so there is no misunderstandin\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella a -\nI have told the brads and barry,- Iam done. its not a negotiation , out !! - fyi given my carlyn joslin\ncastrucci, admonishments,- though my involvement in those - in one instance only gave a name - in\nanother only given an eileen dictated choice btween two 250k preparers. and for castrucci, I actually\nsent emails that 1 take no responsiblity for his being hired. - however you felt strongly that I should be\nsaddled with their outcomes .even with brad wechsler , i again said two months in, Leon, he doesnt get\nit. I tell you this so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire.\n\nA story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly , and when to fly , he\ncouldnt help himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates.\nDonald and I tried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting\nat little nells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on\nboard,- Trump looked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to\nus.- a metaphor for your office.. . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month\nwindow and tens of unasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have\nsaved way more than you often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but 1 reallize you are stressed.\n\nBarry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's , structures. cash flow, financial\nstatments etc. I will present barry my thoughts on the overall redo , it will be the exact same email that i\npresented to you and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming\nreport stil funky). IT etc I pointed out some of the more glaring errors to barry to give him a flavor of\nwhat is to come.\n\nTuesday if you like we should discuss Giacometti , and pesner ._ difficult to finesse him if they are\nfiling documents that you won't. these ridiculous conversations with tons of people on the phone ,\nremoves any claim you might have to not be considered a WILLFUL NON-FILER . ( after youve been\ntold by attnys and pwe that you should file in writing , you have NO choice ) ... worst possible result -\nincluding serious penalties up the kazoo.\n\nDate: Tue, Feb 24, 2015 at 8:20 AM\n\nSubject:\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella (i iii i>\nLeon,\n\nYesterday , again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get\nflavor) and you and 1 will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other\nweeks spent doing the things that I don;t have the time to do.\n\nIn order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you,\n\nmight be helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500\nmillion dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments,\nin various categories ,a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range\nof all types of taxes. , planes. boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no\noversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants.\nconstruction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of Ilc's , including foreign, and with\nall that you only have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars.\n\nI have previously sent you the very same note that 1 have enclosed again below ,this time with\nhighlights . I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to\nhave been raised as one of your concerns , as arule I try to memorialize things in writing in an\nattempt to lay out issues that I fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what 1 would and wouldn't\ndo , - my responsibilities. ete and those things that are not. below you will find details of things that I\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023253",
