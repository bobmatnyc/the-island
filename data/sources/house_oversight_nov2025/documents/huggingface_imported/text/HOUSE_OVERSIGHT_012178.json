  "text": "a\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\n8. ALL IDENTIFIED VICTIMS BE PUT IN SAME POSITION AS IF EPSTEIN\nHAD BEEN TRIED.\n\nMr. Sloman’s Leiter:\n\ne “The Agreement provides for a method of compensation for the victims such that they\nwould be placed in the same position as if Epstein had been convicted of one of the\nenumerated offenses set forth in Title 18, United States Code Section, 2255.”\n\nId.\nThe Truth:\n\n¢ Mr. Sloman continues to mischaracterize the highly irregular provisions of the Deferred\nProsecution Agreement. The SDFL did not merely attempt to preserve the compensation\nrights of those it identified as victims; it attempted to create compensation rights for those\nit identified, without imposing on them the burden of proving that they were in fact\nvictims under § 2255.\n\no In the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the SDFL required Mr. Epstein to waive\nthe right to contest lability under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 as to a list of individuals that\nthe SDFL would not disclose to Mr. Epstein until after he was sentenced and to\npay for an attorney to secure compensation under § 2255 for those undisclosed\nindividuals, or if they decided to sue Mr. Epstein.\n\noO § 2255 ordinarily provides individuals with a right to recover minimum guaranteed\ndamages of $150,000, without having to prove actual damages, only if: (1) they\nwere victims of an enumerated federal offense, including offenses under 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2422 and 2423, (2) they were minors at the time of the offense, and most\nimportantly (3) they were personally injured as a result of the offense.\n\no The defense has confirmed examples of women who testified that they were not\nvictims of Mr. Epstein and suffered no personal injury. These women were,\nnevertheless, on the list of “victims” identified by the government. . In fact, when\nconfronted with the testimony of a women who denied both being a victim and\nincurring personal injury, Ms. Villafana actually acknowledged such testimony.\nTo justify inclusion of that woman on the government’s list, however, Ms.\nVillafana then challenged her own witness’s credibility.\n\ne For this reason, it is false to state that these “identified” individuals are in the same\nposition that they would have been had Epstein been convicted at trial. Had there been a\ntrial, Mr. Epstein would have had a right to confront these individuals through cross-\nexamination. Any individual that did not establish that she was a minor victim of conduct\nthat satisfied each element of an enumerated statute under § 2255,or that she suffered\npersonal injury, would not qualify for any treatment under § 2255. However, under the\nDeferred Prosecution Agreement, as an “identified individual” on the government’s list,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012178",
