  "text": "MY, MY—SO NOW WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF TELLING THE WORLD HOW GOD\nWOULD HAVE HANDLED THE WHOLE MATTER. I BARELY UNDERSTAND MY\nLITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD MUCH LESS THE MIND OF THE OMNISCIENT\nCREATOR. WHO SAYS SHE OR HE IS BIASED TOWARD HUMANS? PERHAPS SHE\nHAS AN AFFECTION FOR PLASMODIUM, AS IN HALDANE’S FAMOUS JOKETO WHEN\nASKED BY A CLERIC WHAT A LIFETIME STUDY OF EVOLUTION HAD TAUGHT\nHALDANE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE CREATOR—“AN INORDINATE FONDNESS\nFOR BEETLES’”—AT THAT TIME, 1/3®” OF ALL ANIMAL SPECIES—300,000—WERE\nBEETLES.\n\n| enjoyed Brian Mannix’s comment, most especially “Pseven”. His argument for\ncooperation is the same as that of Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations. Once a\nmedium of exchange is introduced into a system of barter, itself a reciprocal\nrelationship, it can be vastly extended, with specialization such that one individual\nno longer produces ten pencils/day, but ten people are specialized to produce a\nsingle pencil—and thus a thousand/day. | too share an aversion to cultural/group\nselection though perhaps for other reasons. But I side with Peter in feeling that\nmale self-domestication is more important in damping male psychopathy than\nfemale choice—Richard Wrangham vs Sarah Hrdy among evolutionary\nanthropologists.\n\nPeter’s argument on reduction of inter-birth interval in humans again veers off into\nculture-land when one does not need it—paternal investment, grandmother\ninvestment and older sibling investment are all expected on genetic grounds. The\nauthority on the subject is David Haig at Harvard.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029161",
