The conferees also noted that “[i]n\ninterpreting what is lawful under the written laws and regulations’ ... the\nnormal rules of legal construction would apply.” Jd.\n\n143 See United States v. Kozeny, 582 FE Supp. 2d 535, 537-40 (S.D.NY.\n2008). Likewise, the court found that a provision under Azeri law that\nrelieved bribe payors of criminal iability if they were extorted did\n\nnot make the bribe payments legal. Azeri extortion law precludes the\nprosecution of the payor of the bribes for the illegal payments, but it does\nnot make the payments legal.
