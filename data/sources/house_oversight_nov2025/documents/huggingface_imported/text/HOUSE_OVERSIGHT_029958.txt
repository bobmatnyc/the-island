Hi Jeffrey,
| got more votes than Jeb Bush got in lowa, and | only had one congressional district, he had four!! It’s so funny (to me —
totally embarrassing to him)!!! Still like Trump and might be a delegate to the republican convention.

Was in St. Thomas for a couple of days — did call this island, but never heard back. Went scuba diving off St. Jeff and it
was beautiful. Would be totally funny (to me at least) if you put a big fake shark or statute under the water where the
divers go....

Love ya,
