  "text": "11\n\nWe can only speculate why Obama has such difficulty in effectively\nusing the U.S. military as an instrument of national purpose.\nWinston Churchill said, “In critical and baffling situations, it is\nalways best to return to first principle and simple action.”\n\nWhat is Obama’s first principle regarding the application of the use\nof force in the international arena? He seems to possess no abiding\nstrategic framework about that preeminent presidential responsibility.\nHe makes no clear connection between the use of force and vital U.S.\nnational interests.\n\nThus, he recklessly withdraws from Iraq, imprudently escalates in\nAfghanistan and unwisely intervenes in Libya. One can only wonder\nand worry what he will do if and when he confronts the next crisis\nwhich could involve committing American men and women to\ncombat.\n\nRobert D. Blackwill is Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow for U.S.\nforeign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as\ndeputy national security adviser for strategic planning, ambassador\nto India and presidential envoy to Iraq in the George W. Bush\nadministration.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030040",
