It should be noted that the necrophilia\ncommunity ranges from those who are monogamous and stick with one\npartner for a lifetime, to those who are promiscuous and hop from casket\nto casket.\n\nAccording to his own journal entry, Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of\nthe most revered figures in American literary history, was so devastated by\nthe death of his young wife, Ellen, that, shortly after her burial, he went out\nto the cemetery one night and dug up her corpse, though he didn’ t\nmention exactly what he did with it.\n\nOne of the most popular episodes of the police TV show, Homicide,\nLife On the Streets, was about the investigation of an old lonely widower, a\nmortician, who used to party with the corpses, setting them around a table\nas if they were alive. They investigated him because he shot a neighbor\nwho knew about this practice, and then sat in the garden and waited for\nthe cops. But again, the mortician’ s relationship with those corpses may\nhave been purely platonic.\n\nLet us now eavesdrop on the dialogue of a few participants in an\n\nInternet support group, Necrophiliacs Anonymous:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015356",
