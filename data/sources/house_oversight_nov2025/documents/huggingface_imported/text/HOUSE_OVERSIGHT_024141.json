  "text": "Preferred themes\n\ne High quality dividend yields (sourced from existing European ®\nand UK equities)\nHigh quality companies with geographically diversified business models\nthat pay sustainable dividends offer an attractive income stream in a\nlow yield world. Historically, dividends have made a substantial\ncontribution to total returns, and we expect this to remain the case in\nthe current environment.\n\ne Western winners from emerging market growth (sourced from\nexisting equity holdings)\nEmerging economies continue to grow faster than developed\neconomies. With little need to deleverage and repair balance sheets,\nAsian economies are also well positioned to continue to outpace their\nWestern peers in the years ahead. We have identified companies from a\nvariety of sectors in Europe, the US and Japan which have significant\nexposure to the rapidly growing emerging regions. We believe a\ndiversified portfolio of these companies will reward investors seeking\nto profit from the robust demand growth in emerging economies.\n\ne Natural gas growth gainers\nNatural gas is a relatively clean source of energy, and we think it will\nbenefit from continued substitution for other energy sources over the\nlong term. We have examined the dynamics of the global market and\nthe various components of the gas value chain, and identified the areas\nwe see as the most significant beneficiaries currently. These include\nproducers in Europe and Asia, suppliers of infrastructure, services and\nrelated machinery, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) in the US, )\nthat offer both attractive yields and growth.\n\n36 UBS\n\nGovernment bond alternatives (sourced from government bonds\n- ClO UW)\n\nDeveloped world government bonds offer a comparatively small cushion\nagainst future interest rate hikes and many face increasing credit risk. We\nexpect select bonds of supranational or national agencies, sub-national\ngovernments, multinational corporates, and covered bonds to\noutperform government bonds. We recommend switching out of\ngovernment bonds into these alternatives.\n\nUS high yield corporate bonds (sourced from government bonds -\nclo UW)\n\nPositive economic growth, robust corporate earnings and healthy\nbalance sheets provide support to US high yield corporate bonds. Current\nyield spreads of roughly 660 basis points still price in a much more dire\neconomic outcome than we expect. Historically, US high yield bonds have\ndelivered similar returns to US equities with lower volatility. We continue\nto believe that US high yield corporate bonds represent a more favorable\nrisk/return potential than equities and expect total returns of\napproximately 7% over the next 6 months.\n\nThe place to be in Hedge Funds\n\nRecent economic data has shown signs of improvement, but growth in\nmost developed markets remains muted. In this environment, less\ndirectional hedge fund strategies, such as relative value and event driven,\nshould offer above average returns.\n\nEM corporates: a growing asset class (sourced from global\ngovernment bonds - CIO UW)\n\nGiven our relatively constructive current view on risk, we regard EM\ncorporate debt as more attractive than EM sovereign debt due to its\nhigher overall yield. Over a 6-month horizon, we expect EM corporate\nbonds to outperform US Treasuries and deliver total returns of close to\n8% p.a.\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024141",
