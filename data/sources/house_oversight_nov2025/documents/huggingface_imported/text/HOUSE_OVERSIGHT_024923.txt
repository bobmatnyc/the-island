REMEMBERING CAVALIER MAGAZINE
LAUNCHING A MAGAZINE

My friend Michael Simmons, who has been the editor of National Lampoon and High
Times, observes that Cavalier hired fine scribes. A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth,
William Saroyman, Isaac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeon. Cavalier was launched by Fawcett

Publications in 1952.

Men’s magazine Cavalier (motto: “For the American Male”) was published the year
before Playboy to whom it has often been compared, and back in the day tried to be seen as
slightly hipper, more youthful and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost
an anti-establishment Playboy. A slogan stated: “Your dad bought Playboy, you

bought Cavalier.”
I BECAME A COLUMNIST

I was invited to write a column, named “The Naked Emperor,” for Cavalier, that was beginning
to publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column was a
report on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during

their first trip to America.

There were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist’s holiday. Obviously, there wouldn’t be
enough items to go around, but it was announced that the Beatles’ unwashed towels and bed
linens were to be cut into two-inch squares and sold for $1 each. The price included a notarized

statement of authenticity.
