  "text": "p> EPSTEIN from 14\nasking questions and teenage girls\nstarted talking, a wave of legal\nresistance followed.\n\nIf Palm Beach police didn’t know\nquite who Jeffrey Epstein was, they\nfound out soon enough.\n\nEpstein, now 53, was a quintes-\nsential man of mystery. He amassed\nhis fortune and friends quietly,\nalways in the background as he\nnavigated New York high society.\n\nWhen he first attracted notice in\nthe early 1990s, it was on account of\nthe woman he was dating: Ghislaine\nMaxwell, daughter of the late British\nmedia tycoon Robert Maxwell.\n\nIn a lengthy article, headlined\n“The Mystery of Ghislaine Max-\nwell’s Secret Love,” the British Mail\non Sunday tabloid laid out specula-\ntive stories that the socialite’s beau\nwas a CIA spook, a math teacher, a\nconcert pianist or a corporate head-\nhunter.\n\n“But what is the truth about\nhim?” the newspaper wondered.\n“Like Maxwell, Epstein is both\nflamboyant and intensely private.”\n\nThe media frenzy did not begin\nin full until a decade later. In Sep-\ntember 2002, Epstein was flung into\nthe limelight when he flew Clinton\nand actors Kevin Spacey and Chris\nTucker to Africa on his private jet.\n\nSuddenly everyone wanted to\nknow who Epstein was. New York\nmagazine and Vanity Fair published\nlengthy profiles. The New York Post\nlisted him as one of the city’s most\neligible bachelors and began\ndescribing him in its gossip columns\nwith adjectives such as “mysterious”\nand “reclusive.”\n\nAlthough Epstein gave no inter-\nviews, the broad strokes of his past\nstarted to come into focus.\n\nBuilding a life of extravagance\n\nHe was born blue-collar in 1953,\nthe son of a New York City parks\ndepartment employee, and raised in\nBrooklyn’s Coney Island neighbor-\nhood. He left college without a\nbachelor’s degree but became a\nmath teacher at the prestigious\nDalton School in Manhattan.\n\nThe story goes that the father of\n\none of Epstein’s students was so\nimpressed with the man that he put\nhim in touch with a senior partner at\nBear Stearns, the global investment\nbank and securities firm.\n_ . 11976, Epstein left Dalton for a\njob at Bear Stearns. By the early\n1980s, he had started J. Epstein and\nCo. That is when he began making\nhis millions in earnest.\n\ne\n\nep tnnttesenrye ct\n\nFinis 2\n\nLittle is known or said about r\nEpstein’s business except this: He —\n\nmanages money for the extremely\nwealthy. He is said to\naccounts only of $1 billion or great-\ner.\n\nIt has been estimated he has\n\n: roughly 15 clients, but their identi-\n- ties are the subject of only specula-\n\ntion. All except for one: Leslie Wex-\nner, founder of The Limited retail\n\n‘ chain and a former Palm Beacher\n\nwho is said to have been a mentor to\n\nEpstein.\n\nWexner sold Epstein one of his\n\n| most lavish residences: a massive\n| townhouse that dominates a block\nf on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It\n| is reported to have, among its finer\n| features, closed-circuit television\n| and a heated sidewalk to melt away\n| fallen snow.\n\nThat townhouse, thought to be\n\nthe largest private residence in\n; Manhattan, is only a piece of the\n| extravagant world Epstein built over\n: time.\n\nIn New Mexico, he constructed a\n\n| 27,000-square-foot hilltop mansion\n\nona 10,000-acre ranch outside Santa\n\n| Fe. Many believed itto be the largest\n| home in the state.\n\nhandle .\n\n“In Palm Beach, he bought a |\n\nwaterfront home on El Brillo Way. .\n\nAnd he owns a 100-acre private\n\nisland in the Virgin Islands.\nPerhaps as remarkable as his\n\nlavish homes is his extensive net-\n\n| work of friends and associates at the\n| highest echelons of power. This\n| includes not only socialites but also\n| business tycoons, media moguls,\n| politicians, royalty and Nobel Prize-\n\nwinning scientists whose research\n\n‘ he often funds.\n\n“Just like other people collect\n\n| art, he collects scientists,” said\n\nMartin Nowak, who directs the\nProgram for Evolutionary Dynamics\nat Harvard University and was\n\nreportedly the recipient of a $30 |\n\nmillion research donation from\nEpstein.\nEpstein\n\nAnd yet he managed for decades\n\nto maintain a low profile. He avoids\n' eating out and was rarely photo-\n-graphed.\n\nis said to have ,\n| befriended former Harvard Presi- —\n| dent Larry Summers, prominent law\n| Professor Alan Dershowitz, Donald\n| Trump and New York Daily News\n1 Publisher Mort Zuckerman.\n\n“The odd thing is I never met\nhim,” said Dominick Dunne, the\nfamous chronicler of the trials and\ntribulations of the very rich. “I wasn’t\neven aware of him,” except fora\nVanity Fair article.\n\nEpstein’s friendship with Clinton\nhas attracted the most attention.\n\nEpstein met Clinton as early as\n1995, when he paid tens of thou-\nsands of dollars to join him at an\nintimate fund-raising dinner in Palm\nBeach. But from all appearances,\nthey did not become close friends\nuntil after Clinton left the Oval Office\nand moved to New York.\n\nEpstein has donated more than\n$100,000 to Democratic candidates’\ncampaigns, including John Kerry’s\npresidential bid, the reelection\ncampaign of New Mexico Gov. Bill\nRichardson and the Senate bids of :\nJoe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham\nClinton, Christopher Dodd and\nCharles Schumer.\n\nPowerful friends and enemies\n\nA Vanity Fair profile found\ncracks in the veneer of Epstein’s life\nstory. The 2003 article said he left\nBear Stearns in the wake of a federal\nprobe and a possible Securities and\nExchange Commission violation. It\nalso pointed out that Citibank once\nsued him for defaulting on a $20\nmillion loan.\n\nThe article suggested that one of\n\nhis business mentors and previous\n\nemployers was Steven Hoffenberg,\nnow serving a prison term after ©\n“pilking investors out of more than\n\n$450 million in one of the largest\n‘Ponzi schemes in American histo-\n\nry. ;\n\nAs he amassed his wealth,\nEpstein made enemies in disputes\nboth large and small. He sued the\n\n-man who in 1990 sold him his\n\nmultimillion-dollar Palm Beach\nhome over a dispute about less than\n$46,000 in furnishings.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_ 018932",
