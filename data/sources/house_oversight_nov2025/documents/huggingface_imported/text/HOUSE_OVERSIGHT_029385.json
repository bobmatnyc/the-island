  "text": "¢ A few sentences on the “nation-\nstate law’. This is a redundant and\neven harmful law. In general, and\nparticularly at this point. To our friends\nit signals that Israel is losing its self-\nconfidence regarding the obvious —\nnamely,its unique identity as the\nJewish-democratic state as reflected by\nthe \"Declaration of Independence\".\nTo our enemies it provides an effective\ntool to make Israel a suspect— of being\na country that's willingly drifting away\nfrom the norms of democracy — as a\npreliminary step towards\ninstitutionalized discrimination.\nAnd one has to wonder: what was\nwrong with what we had until this\npoint? What's wrong with the\n\"Declaration of Independence\"? Who\nneeds this? And why?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029385",
