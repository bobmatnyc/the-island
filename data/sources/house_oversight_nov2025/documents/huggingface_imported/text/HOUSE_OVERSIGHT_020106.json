  "text": "main event in Bedminster that day was the ceremonial signing of an act extending the\nfunding of a program that let veterans obtain medical care outside VA hospitals. The\nsigning was held in a big ballroom at the Clubhouse two hours after Alex Field’s attack.\n\nDuring the signing, Trump took a moment to condemn the “hatred, bigotry, and\nviolence on many sides” in Charlottesville. Almost immediately, the president came under\nattack for the distinction he had appeared to refuse to draw between avowed racists and\nthe other side. As Richard Spencer had correctly understood, the president’s sympathies\nwere muddled. However easy and obvious it was to condemn white racists—even self-\nstyled neo-Nazis—he instinctively resisted.\n\nIt wasn’t until the next morning that the White House finally tried to clarify Trump’s\nposition with a formal statement: “The President said very strongly in his statement\nyesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred. Of course that\nincludes white supremacists, KKK neo-Nazi and all extremist groups. He called for\nnational unity and bringing all Americans together.”\n\nBut in fact he hadn’t condemned white supremacists, KKK, and neo-Nazis—and he\ncontinued to be stubborn about not doing it.\n\nIn a call to Bannon, Trump sought help making his case: “Where does this all end? Are\nthey going to take down the Washington Monument, Mount Rushmore, Mount Vernon?”\nBannon—still not receiving his summons to Bedminster—urged this to be the line: the\npresident should condemn violence and misfits and also defend history (even with\nTrump’s weak grasp of it). Stressing the literal issue of monuments would bedevil the left\nand comfort the right.\n\nBut Jared and Ivanka, with Kelly backing them, urged presidential behavior. Their plan\nwas to have Trump return to the White House and address the issue with a forceful\ncensure of hate groups and racial politics—exactly the unambiguous sort of position\nRichard Spencer had strategically bet Trump would not willingly take.\n\nBannon, understanding these same currents in Trump, lobbied Kelly and told him that\nthe Jarvanka approach would backfire: Jt will be clear his heart’s not in it, said Bannon.\n\nThe president arrived shortly before eleven o’clock on Monday morning at a White\nHouse under construction and a wall of shouted questions about Charlottesville: “Do you\ncondemn the actions of neo-Nazis? Do you condemn the actions of white supremacists?”\nSome ninety minutes later he stood in the Diplomatic Reception Room, his eyes locked on\nto the teleprompter, and delivered a six-minute statement.\n\nBefore getting to the point: “Our economy is now strong. The stock market continues\nto hit record highs, unemployment is at a sixteen-year low, and businesses are more\noptimistic than ever before. Companies are moving back to the United States and bringing\nmany thousands of jobs with them. We have already created over one million jobs since I\ntook office.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020106",
