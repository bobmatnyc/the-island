It was nearly eight\nwhen we set out. Twenty minutes later, we crossed the border. I led the way,\nwith Motti Nagar, Moshiko, Kuti Sharabi and, finally, Avi Telem behind. We\ncarried the bugging equipment and our tools in our backpacks. Avi and I had a\npair of binoculars. Mine were bulkier, but offered a slightly better view in the\ndarkness. Each of us had an Uzi and a pair of grenades. All our planning had\nbeen aimed at getting on to the Golan, installing the bug and getting out again. If\nall went well, no one would even know we’d been there. But we had practiced\nwhat to do if things went wrong. If challenged or ambushed by a Syrian patrol,\nwe would operate by old Company A rules. We would open fire.\n\nThe climb onto the plateau wasn’t too tough, not nearly as hard as our\nsayeret training treks. When we reached the top, there was no obvious sign of\nany Syrians. Still, we had to move slowly. Even with my binoculars, I could see\nbarely 30 yards into the moonless night, and I had to scan the route ahead, back\nand forth, to make sure there were none of the fences or warning signs to keep\nthe Syrians’ own soldiers, or unsuspecting shepherds, from a minefield. Soon,\nhowever, we found an obviously well-used footpath which I figured was very\nlikely to be safe.\n\nWhen we had walked a few minutes, we found ourselves going through a\ntangle of bushes and reeds, some of them up to two feet high, still dry and\ncrackly from the summer. Aside from the risk of tripping, I knew the noise we\nwere making might attract attention. I told the rest of the team to hang back 20\nyards behind me. I moved forward to make sure the route was clear before\nsignaling them to follow. I had been slightly nervous on the climb up, not so\nmuch because I expected trouble but because there was no way of knowing\nwhat to expect. Much as I tried to put the concerns of the generals from my\nmind, I also knew that this was no ordinary mission. But almost immediately,\nthe nerves had gone, and I was now focused only on getting us through the next\nminute, the next 20 or 30 yards of the Golan.\n\nBut as soon as we’d made it across the plateau, we ran into trouble. We\nneeded to cross the Banias River. On our map, I’d picked out what looked to be\na Shallow ford. But the water was much higher than we expected. After\nspending 30 minutes scouting the bank for 150 yards in either direction, we\nsettled on what seemed to be the shallowest part. Yet we hadn’t anticipated the\nneed to cross a river in full flow. Worse, we’d never trained to do it. Not had we\n\n68\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011539",
