  "text": "terrifying Golden Rules of Computer Security.“Rule One: Don’t Own A Computer.” The\nmachine that Morris Jr. created was madeentirely of software. It took the form ofa\ncompact, simply designed computer program he’d written and designed to spread\nquickly and easily on the young systems of the Internet. It ran a mere 99 lines, took\nmost computers nanoseconds to execute and it worked like this: The program - it\nlater became known as a “worm” by the police who would come to find and arrest\nMorris Jr. - would find an open door on a network-connected computer. (In 1988,\nthe pre-Warez Dude era, finding such doors was not difficult. Finding locked doors\nwas probably harder.) Once Morris’ program had slithered inside and loaded itself\nonto the machine, like a dog slipping through an unattended puppy door, it would\nsniff around, rattle a few more doors to find any passwords that had been left\nunsecured. Then it would move on to the next machine. Knock, knock. Rattle, rattle.\nNext machine. Morris designed his code to simply repeat this process over and over.\nFilling, as a result, each machine’s memory with multiple, peformance-deadening\ncopies of the same program. A house full of puppies, in a sense. After several hours\nof this flu-like spread, a wave of unplanned, unending computation began choking\nthe net.\n\nMorris later explained he’d only meant his program as a demonstration, as a test of\nsorts. He wanted to show how machines might be made more safe. But he seemed to\ngrasp, almost immediately, that he’d made a mistake and that the worm was\nrunning away from him. He emailed a friend: How the hell to stop it? His friend had\nno idea either. They scrambled at least to warn system administrators about the\ndangerous code that would shortly devour their machines. “There may be a virus\nloose on the Internet,” they wrote. But that note, in a bit of bad luck, was\nquarantined inside a Harvard computer that had already been unplugged. So, a few\nhours after Morris released his code, unwarned and unprepared, the Internet froze.\n212 On November 2\"¢ and 3rd, 1988 machines around the world were shut off, cables\nwere pulled out of walls, and systems were wiped and restarted in a race to stop the\nrobot-like spread of the disease and then to finally kill it off. 213\n\nThe Morris Worm was, on those fall 1988 days, acting out a sober-minded insight of\nthe famed biological historian Alfred Crosby: “The nineteenth century was followed\nby the twentieth century, which was followed by the...nineteenth century.”214\nCrosby meant that our age of topological connection meant we were back, again, in\nan age of infections. And this was true: Morris program was mapping out, like an\nepidemic, new routes in the age of high-speed digital contagion. But - and this is\nwhy we care about it here - by the time it reached “peak infection”, the worm was\n\n212 So, a few hours: David Moore, Colleen Shannon, k claffy, “Code-Red: a case study\nof the spread of a worm on the Internet” IMW ‘02 Proceedings of the 2nd ACM\nSIGCOMM Workshop on Internet measurment (2002), 273-284\n\n213 Morris later explained: Ted Eisenberg, DavidGries, Juris Hartmanis, Don\nHolcomb, and M.
