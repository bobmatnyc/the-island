  "text": "Amendment. As a result, under the “sword and shield doctrine” widely recognized in Florida\nsaseloun his suit must be dismissed.\n\n_ “[TJhe law is well settled that a plaintiffis not entitled to both his silence and his\nlawsuit.” Boys & Girls Clubs of Marion County, Ine. v. J.A., 22 So.3d 855, 856 (Fla. 5th Dist.\nct. App. 2009) (Griffin, J., concurring specially). Thus, “a person may not seek affirmative\nrelief in a civil action and then invoke the fifth amendment to avoid giving discovery, using the\nfifth amendment as both a ‘sword and a shield.’”” DePalma v. DePalma, 538 So.2d 1290, 1290\n(F 18 4\" Dist. Ct. App. 1989) (quoting DeLisi v. Bankers Insurance Co., 436 So.2d 1099 (Fla. 4\"\nDist. Ct. App. 1983)). Put another way, “[a] civil litigant’s fifth amendment right to avoid self\ninetimination may be used as a shield but not a sword. This means that a plaintiff seeking\naffirmative relief in a civil action may not invoke the fifth amendment and refuse to comply with\nthe defendant’s discovery requests, thereby thwarting the defendant’s defenses.” Rollins Burdick\nHunter of New York, Inc. v. Euroclassic Limited, Inc., 502 So. 2d 959 (Fla. 3 Dist. Court App.\n1983)\n\nHere, Epstein is trying to do precisely what the “well settled” law forbids. Specifically,\nhe is trying to obtain “affirmative relief” —i.e., forcing Edwards to pay money damages — while\nsimultaneously precluding Edwards from obtaining legitimate discovery at the heart of the\nallegations that form the basis for the relief Epstein is seeking. As recounted more fully in the\nstatement of undisputed facts, Epstein has refused to answer such basic questions about his\nlawsuit as:\n\ne “Specifically what are the allegations against you which you contend Mr.\nEdwards ginned up?”\n\ne “Well, which of Mr. Edwards’ cases do you contend were fabricated?”\n\n17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013386",
