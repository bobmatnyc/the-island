  "text": "such as that held by Rene Thom is that once accepting a set of natural givens,\ncalled the axioms, the rest of the knowledge of this reality grows in the form of\ntheorems that relate to the axioms and each other through their logical consistency.\nKnowledge of reality is moved by the ever-forward mathematical refinement of a\npriori conditions to do away with the theorems’ exceptions, called counter examples.\n\nThe Hebraic Bible’s view of signifiers such as words and symbols Is close to,\nbut not identical with, the Platonic view of mathematical formalism. According to the\nTorah, God made the word with words. God spoke and the world became real. The\nAramaic for “Il create in speaking” is avara k’davara , or as the magician says, as he\nwaves his wand over an apparently empty black high hat, abracadabra. The\nHebrew word for word, davar, also signifies thing. This view contrasts with the\nmathematical formalists, among them Hilbert, who considered the signifiers of\nabstract mathematics simply symbols used in a game, the rules of which being\narbitrary, must include proofs of consistencies among them. Consistency from the\npoint of view of physics was addressed by Hertz, in Die Prinzipien der\nMechanik,(1894), where he expressed the formalist theoretical physicist’s work as\n“...within our own minds we create images or symbols of the external objects, and\nwe construct them in such a way that the logically necessary consequences of the\nimages are again the images of the physically necessary consequences of the\nobjects.”\n\nIn another set of related contrasts, the constructionist mathematician will\nargue that mathematical assertions are only true if they can be demonstrated, found\nor constructed. In contrast, the classical school of mathematics can develop the\ncase for the truth of mathematical statements if they are consistent with field’s\nnetwork of theorems and proofs, even if, up to the current time, no specific example\nof this truth can be demonstrated. The former can be thought of as a builder, the\nlatter as a discoverer. For example, suppose we try to make a proposition about\nperfect numbers where a perfect number is defined as being equal to half the sum\nof its divisors. Using the perfect number 6, we find that its non-identity divisors are\n1, 2, and 3 and half of their sum = 6. Our proposition: either there exists an odd\n\nperfect number, or else there exists no odd perfect number. An expression of this\n\n158\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013658",
