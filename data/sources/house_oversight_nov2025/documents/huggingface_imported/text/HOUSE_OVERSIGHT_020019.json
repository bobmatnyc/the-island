It was, in other words, business as usual, albeit with a\nnew burst of enthusiasm for the administrative state.\n\nBut its real import was that it gave Kushner his own internal White House staff, a team\nof people working not just on Kushner-supported projects—all largely antithetical to\nBannon projects—but, more broadly, as Kushner explained to one staffer, “on expanding\nmy footprint.” Kushner even got his own “comms person,” a dedicated spokesperson and\nKushner promoter. It was a bureaucratic build-out meant not only to enhance Kushner but\nto diminish Steve Bannon.\n\nTwo days after the announcement about Jared’s expanded power base, Ivanka was\nformally given a White House job, too: adviser to the president. From the beginning she\nhad been a key adviser to her husband—and he to her. Still, it was an overnight\nconsolidation of Trump family power in the White House. It was, quite at Steve Bannon’s\nexpense, a remarkable bureaucratic coup: a divided White House had now all but been\nunited under the president’s family.\n\nHis son-in-law and daughter hoped—they were even confident—that they could speak\nto DJT’s better self, or at least balance Republican needs with progressive rationality,\ncompassion, and good works. Further, they could support this moderation by routing a\nsteady stream of like-minded CEOs through the Oval Office. And, indeed, the president\nseldom disagreed with and was often enthusiastic about the Jared and Ivanka program. “If\nthey tell him the whales need to be saved, he’s basically for it,” noted Katie Walsh.\n\nBut Bannon, suffering in his internal exile, remained convinced that he represented\nwhat Donald Trump actually believed, or, more accurately, what the president felt. He\nknew Trump to be a fundamentally emotional man, and he was certain that the deepest\npart of him was angry and dark. However much the president wanted to support his\ndaughter and her husband’s aspirations, their worldview was not his. As Walsh saw it,\n“Steve believes he is Darth Vader and that Trump is called to the dark side.”\n\nIndeed, Trump’s fierce efforts to deny Bannon’s influence may well have been in\ninverse proportion to the influence Bannon actually had.\n\nThe president did not truly listen to anybody. The more you talked, the less he listened.\n“But Steve is careful about what he says, and there is something, a timbre in his voice and\nhis energy and excitement, that the president can really hone in on, blocking everything\nelse out,” said Walsh.\n\nAs Jared and Ivanka were taking a victory lap, Trump signed Executive Order 13783, a\nchange in environmental policy carefully shepherded by Bannon, which, he argued,\neffectively gutted the National Environmental Policy Act, the 1970 law that served as the\nfoundation of modern environmental protections and that required all executive agencies\nto prepare environmental impact statements for agency actions.
