  "text": "talk about anyways. He wanted to talk about something else anyways.\nSitting me down at the dining room table he began his spiel. “I know you\ndon’t think much of me anymore, how could you? I’m a junkie who\nsteals and sells drugs for a living, but I promise that’s all going to change\nnow. Adam is dead because of me and the only way I can make it up to\nhim is to get away from it all. I promise things are going to get better.” It\nwas a convincing talk, but I knew him all too well. His demon inside\nyearned for him to fail but who was I to second-guess him out loud, I\ncould only try to give him hope. “No one is perfect TJ. At least you’re\ntrying now and that’s all that matters to me. I am so proud of you.” I gave\nhim a sincere hug and kissed him for the first time in a long time. “1 love\nyou,” he said to me and I returned my love back. We slept in the same\nbed together that night and were officially back on together.\n\nTwo days later I was gone again, beckoned to be in Santa Fe. Ghislane\nonly told me that I was to meet someone there, not sure of whom that\nwas. It wasn’t my place to ask questions. As far as I knew it could be\nanyone and I had no choice but to be compliant to their needs. It was the\nmiddle of the day when I arrived at the airport. One of the ranch hands\ncame to pick me up in a big work truck that smelled like dirt and sweat\nbut I didn’t mind that’s what I loved about the countryside.\n\nWhen we arrived at the mansion my guest was already there waiting for\nme. I couldn’t wipe the look off my face as he turned around from the\nbookshelf that he was standing at. “Hello” that same old cheesy grin\ngreeted me once again. It was his highness Prince Andrew, and what a\nsight. He wrapped his arms around my waist and greeted me like an old\nfriend. | hugged him back rolling my eyes at the same time, already\ndreading what lay in store over the next couple of days. My job was to\nentertain him endlessly, whether that meant having to bestow him my\nbody during an erotic massage or simply take him horseback riding. For\nthe next couple of days he was to be my only concern, but he wasn’t. I\ncalled in checking on T.J a few times a day, not wanting to be a nag but\njust hoping he hadn’t had any thoughts about relapsing. He was doing\ngreat, even applying for a couple jobs. Being reassured by him made my\ntime away less complicated and thankfully with the help of my ever-\nready Xanax I was able to cope with the ordeal.\n\nThe mansion was completely empty save a couple of maids who also\ncooked our dinners for us, and a couple bodyguards that we hardly even\nsaw at all. The time dragged by slowly for me as I was counting down the\nhours until 1 flew away again, anywhere but here I thought. It wasn’t easy\nmeeting the sexual desires of these strange men, the Prince being one of\nthem. He loved my feet and even licked in between my toes. Then there\nwas the lack of passion in the intimacy we shared, to him I was just\nanother girl and to me he was just another job. Not the right reasons to be\n\n105\n\n0 Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFRE004238\n\ntogether but I thought in this world and to these monsters, there didn’t\nneed to be a reason. To them it’s nothing but a reenactment of their\npersonal fantasies. To me it was a living nightmare.\n\nThankfully one of Jeffrey’s assistants from New York called me on my\ncell phone early in the morning on the second day to fill me in on my\nnext adventure. I had a flight booked for me to leave that afternoon to\narrive at La Guardia airport in the evening. Even though | had to go back\nto yet another controlling man, I was still relieved. At least I was used to\nthe confinements of Jeffrey’s control and in some twisted way he was\nmore comforting than these strangers he sent me to. Overlooking the city\nof New York as the plane landed felt like 1 was flying from one cage to\nanother, Entrapped by falling victim to the predators that lured me into\ntheir enclosure. I didn’t know how I would ever get out again. That deep\npit in my stomach began to churn again, a physical reaction to the anxiety\nI was plagued with. Before getting off the plane | touched up my make-\nup to hide any signs of the frailty I was feeling.\n\nJo-Jo met me at the arrival terminal and picked up my luggage for me.\nHe never said much at all, nodding to any reciprocating conversation. I\ndon’t think he could really speak that good of English anyways. It was\nbetter for me as I preferred the quietness for the moment. He opened the\nback door for me and we headed off for my next prison cell. When we got\nto Jeffrey’s mansion on 72™, the place looked empty. 1 walked up the\nstaircase to Jeffrey’s office and he wasn’t there. Feeling a bit hungry |\nwalked back down to where the kitchen was. I opened the fridge and\nfound some leftovers that Adam, Jeffrey’s chef, had cooked. | loved his\ncooking, when it wasn’t filled with beansprouts and tofu. He used to\nmake me the best pizza upon request, or whenever he was cooking\nseafood, which he knew I hated. He had an honest appeal about him and\nnever even took notice when on many occasions us girls would be\nprancing around topless, sometimes even stark naked around the pool or\nbeach. He would have to serve us our meals and would do it with such a\ncasual professionalism, never making anyone uneasy at any occasion.\n\nHalf way through my meal the kitchen doors swung open and incoming\nwas Jeffrey and Ghislane. Choking down my bite of food down, I got up\nfrom my seat and kissed them both on the cheeks. “ Hi guys, how are\nyou?” I greeted them and Ghislane answered for them both “Good, good.\nSit down and finish your meal, don’t let us interrupt you.” I hated eating\nalone in front of people, chewing food and maintaining a conversation at\nthe same time didn’t give off the best look. “‘I was just finishing anyways,\ncan I get you guys anything, maybe a tea or something?” Always playing\nmy part, another reason to keep me around I guess, 1 went beyond the call\nof duty and after the last period with them, | had been reminded of my\nplace. “Yes, Ill take a one” Ghislane stated. “Jeffrey how about you,\n\n106\n\n1 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nGIUVEFRLEOO4239.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021197",
