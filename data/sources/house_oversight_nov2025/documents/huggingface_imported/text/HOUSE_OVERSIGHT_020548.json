Since then, Mingjing has significantly modified its editorial stance, switching\nits focus from politics to real estate, immigration, and investing. Part of the reason\nfor this modification appears linked to the disappearance in China of the wife of\none of Mingjing’s reporters after Mingjing aired interviews with a dissident Chinese\n\nbusinessman.*°\n\nBeijing has also moved to tighten the ideological consistency for these papers. In 2001,\nthe Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs and the China News Service began a biannual\nconference, the Forum on the Global Chinese Language Media, hosting representatives\nfrom hundreds of Chinese-language periodicals from around the world. Kicking off\nthe first conference in 2001, Guo Zhaojin, the president of the China News Service,\nsaid a key goal of the meeting was to persuade participating Overseas Chinese media\nto use copy from the China News Service instead of reports from competing Chinese-\nlanguage news services from Taiwan or from the West.** The conference also appears\nto serve as a platform for Beijing to convince critics to modify their tone and to ensure\nthat overseas Chinese-language newspapers follow the Party’s line. Essays released\nduring the conferences praised the censorship of views opposed by the Party and\nstressed the necessity of, in the words of one piece in 2015, “properly telling China’s story”\n\n(echoing Xi Jinping’s instructions).\n\nAnd Beijing’s efforts have had some successes. Ranked the number-five Chinese website\nin the United States, http://backchina.com was once an independent media voice like\nDuowei. But in 2017, its editors attended the ninth forum in China, and since then\n\nbackchina’s reporting has become far more positive about the PRC.\n\nIn 2006, the China News Service started holding an Advanced Seminar for the Overseas\nChinese Language Media, for select groups of editors and reporters from overseas;\n\na seminar in 2006, for example, focused on the correct reading of “socialism with\nChinese characteristics,” while a workshop in 2010 concerned China’s policies in Tibet\nand Xinjiang. At the thirteenth Seminar in 2015, He Yafei, then the assistant director\nof the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, argued that overseas Chinese media needed to\npromote the Belt and Road Initiative and essentially embrace the role of becoming a\nmouthpiece of the CCP promoting China’s national strategy.” Beijing also dispatched\nChinese officials overseas to instruct Chinese-language media on how to “correctly”\nreport the news. As the Beijing 2008 Olympics approached, Politburo member and\nhead of China’s Olympic Committee Liu Qi met at the PRC consulate in New York\n\nSection 6\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020548",
