We are gathering background research on the major \ncandidates for President. \nSeeing that both former President Clinton and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the Jeffrey \nEpstein case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that \ncould help explain Mr. Epstein's dealings and interactions with both men. \nI would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation at \nyour earliest convenience. \nPlease let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet. \nMany thanks, \nMatthew \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032231 \nMatthew Mask \nProducer, ABC News \nWork: \nMobile: \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
