  "text": "At the other end of the spectrum, using military means in the short term to\nguarantee prevention would entail a vast use of force -- essentially an\nunofficial, semipermanent occupation of Iran. This is not a viable path,\nparticularly since other diplomatic possibilities have not yet been\nexhausted.\n\nSimilarly, sanctions, while effective, are not sufficient by themselves.\nThey must be intertwined with negotiations -- as Washington and its allies\nincrease the pressure, cohesive and meaningful talks with equivalent\nconcessions should follow suit. Some have argued that negotiations should\nexpand to a \"big for big\" format, but decades of mistrust between the\nUnited States and Iran make smaller deals more practical. Such an\napproach would have to focus on ending Iran's most problematic\nenrichment activity: processing uranium to the 20 percent threshold, which\nmakes the leap to weapons-grade material much easier. Instead, the regime\ncould limit itself to 5 percent enrichment, and under strict supervision by\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nThe intelligence community widely believes that although Iran has not yet\ndecided to make a nuclear weapon, it is still moving to acquire all the\nnecessary capabilities in case it chooses that path. Accordingly,\nWashington will need to obtain a concrete Iranian commitment to convert\nits stocks of readily upgradeable gaseous uranium into metallic fuel\nelements, which pose significantly less of a threat. A serious inspection\nsystem would need to be implemented in order to monitor these\nrequirements. In return, the Iranians would expect the lifting of nuclear-\nrelated sanctions. They would also likely ask for acknowledgement that\nthey have the right to continue their civil enrichment program, whether for\nsupposed use in cancer treatment or to safeguard against a potential\nRussian decision to cease fueling the Bushehr reactor.\n\nThus far, President Obama has been frustrated at the lack of progress in\nresponse to his openness toward the Iranian regime, and his new cabinet\nhas an obligation to help him solidify a negotiating position that improves\nthe situation. If the Iranians continue to reject U.S. positions that\nseemingly respond to some of their demands, then the administration\nshould begin applying other pressures. These steps should be taken sooner\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018206",
