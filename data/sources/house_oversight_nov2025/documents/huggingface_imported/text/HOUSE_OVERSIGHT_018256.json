  "text": "simplified and misplaced. Fear deflation? Fear ISIS? Fear the RMB? What we should\nbe contemplating with great care is the connected skein that enmeshes us and all\nthese connected knots of worry. We will see, over and over again, the way in which\nconnection shifts, alters and even destroys the way an object moves and lives. The\nmain point here is straightforward: New links, exploding into operation around us\neverywhere now, alter everything from how terrorists operate to how investments\nperform. And the failure to spot, use and understand that fact will be a source of our\nbiggest future tragedies. Do you feel the global economy is more stable now than in\n2008? Are we less susceptible to terror now? Is your data more secure than in the\npast? What do all these problems have in common?\n\nPerhaps we're targeting the wrong things.\n\nIf the idea of a Seventh Sense for our changing world is quickly apprehensible\nenough - It’s that gut feeling that seems to animate wild new businesses or attacks or\nrisks - the deeper logic will be harder to name and master. We will have to consider\nthe most ancient instincts for power and safety in light of the very newest\ntechnological experiences: speed, machine intelligence, really constant connection.\n“Instead of thinking in terms of surfaces - two dimensions - or spheres - three\ndimensions - on is asked to think of nodes that have as many dimensions as they\nhave connection,” the French philosopher Bruno Latour has written of a network\nage. “Modern societies cannot be described without recognizing them as having a\nfibrous, thread-like, wiry, string, ropy, capillary character that is never captured by\nthe notions of levels, layers, territories, spheres, categories, structures, systems.”!9\nFamiliar borders, like the ones dividing science and politics or military power and\ncivilian safety begin to erode when everything is linked. Computing machines and\nnetworks were once locked into usefully narrow silos, unconnected: banking,\nmedical monitoring, power grids. In the past you could mark them as having\n“levels”. But now they overlap and inform each other, meshed into that stringy\nsurface Latour describes.2° The Seventh Sense is a feeling for just how this world\nmight be navigated; how those fibers might be pulled and yoked to new purposes.\n\nThis multitude of interwoven links is why networks and their pieces spill now even\ninto the non-digital elements of our life, from how we grow our food (with GPS-\nguided, self-driven tractors) to how we fight our wars (from a distance, using\nconstantly connected drones.) As a result, many of the technical choices we’re about\nto make will be strikingly political. Who has access to what data? Where is the line\n\n19 “Instead of thinking”: Bruno Latour, “On actor-network theory: A few\nclarifications,” In: Soziale Welt47 369-381\n\n20 Now the overlap and inform: Richard Mortier, Hamed Haddadi, Tristan\nHenderson, Derek McAuley, and Jon Crowcroft, “Human-Data Interaction: The\nHuman Face of the Data-Driven Society”, Social Science Research Network (October\n1, 2014)\n\n24\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018256",
