These are based on interviews, police\ninvestigation documents, and court filings. We changed the\nnames and identities of the girls, hoping to protect them from\nmore embarrassment and harm.\n\nThere never was any doubt that Jeffrey Epstein was guilty. He\nadmitted as much in the non-prosecution agreement he agreed\nto sign in 2007. The question is, what exactly was he guilty of?\n\nThis book attempts to answer that question and many others\nabout this strange and mysterious man. These days people all\naround the world are angry about and suspicious of the super\nrich and powerful. The story of Jeffrey Epstein is an object lesson\nabout why we ought to be. To put it simply, some people think\nthey can operate outside the law. And that’s what they do.\n\n—James Patterson, Palm Beach, February 20, 2016\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019117",
