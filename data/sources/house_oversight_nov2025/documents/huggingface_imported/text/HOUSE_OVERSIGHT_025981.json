However, the spill-over\n\ninto US Treasuries was relatively muted (Chart 7), and coupled with a small and fleeting\ndrawdown in US equities, risk parity portfolio volatility failed to rise materially (Chart 8).\nConsequently, risk parity funds were likely forced to unwind little to none of their\nleverage last week and remain near max leverage levels (Chart 9).\n\nFor this very reason, the latent risk in this corner of the quant fund space remains worth\nmonitoring. Furthermore, as we noted post-Brexit, fixed income allocations within risk\nparity funds are historically elevated today. And with federal-funds futures markets\nimplying a ~25% chance of a Sep rate hike and less than a 50% probability of a Dec\nhike, bond markets may be surprised by a 2016 Fed hike.\n\nChart 7: Last week’s sharp sell-off in JGBs did Chart 8: Consequently, risk parity portfolio Chart 9: Hence risk parity funds did not de-\nnot spill-over into US Treasuries volatility remained quite muted lever materially and remain highly levered\n104 108 10%\n4 4 9%\n03 06 8%\n102 104 i\n6%\n101 102 5%\n4%\n100 100 3% :\n2% Dec-12 Dec-13 Dec-14 Dec-15\n99 98\n\nAug- Aug- Aug- Aug- Aug-\n\nJan-16 —— Apr-16 Jul-16 12 13 14 15 16\n\n——LOW Vol Target (6%) & Lvg (1.5x)\n\na =——=MEDIUM Vol Target (8%) & Lvg (2x)\nspall STS dake ren ——=Historical volatility of unlevered risk\n40y UST futures total return (right) parity portfolio HIGH Vol Target (10%) & Lvg (3x)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

However, what’s less appreciated in our\nview is the impact on risk parity allocations as a result of the re/ative dynamics\nbetween component volatilities and correlation. For example, through the close on the\nMonday post-Brexit (27-Jun-16}, S&P 500 volatility rose from 9.6% two days prior to\n17.9% (increase of 1.9x) while 10-Year US Treasury Futures return volatility rose 4.3%\nto 6.6% (increase of 1.5x). Despite these outsized vol moves, in a recent report we\nshowed that owing to the diversification (increasingly negative correlation) between\nequities and bonds, unlevered risk parity portfolio volatility remained stable and hence,\ntarget vol overlays were less likely to be subject to model-driven selling.\n\nGiven low levels of realized volatility across asset classes, it’s also intuitive to expect\ncontinued elevated levels of leverage in risk parity products. To the extent that the\nleverage is via vol control overlays, there are reasonable concerns on the potential\nmarket impact should these model-driven investments be forced to simultaneously\ndeleverage. To that end, we provide a simple scenario tool (Chart 10) to help investors\nassess what relative moves in the S&P 500 and 10-year US Treasury futures could\ncatalyze significant deleveraging by rules-based, vol-controlled risk parity funds.\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n4 Global Equity Volatility Insights | O09 August 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025981",
