  "text": "In general, a QSub is not treated as a separate corporation for federal tax purposes. ¥ All of the\nQSub's assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit are treated as assets,\nliabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the Subchapter S corporation parent. 78\nAs discussed below, however, there are certain regulatory exceptions to the general rule that a\nQSub is not treated as a separate corporation for federal tax purposes.\n\nQualified REIT Subsidiary Rules.\n\nA qualified real estate investment trust subsidiary (QRS) is a relatively specialized form of\ndisregarded entity. A real estate investment trust (REIT) is an electing domestic corporation (or\ntrust or other association taxable as a corporation) that meets various organizational\nrequirements, derives most of its income from passive real property sources, distributes most of\nits income to its owners, and holds mainly real estate. 42 REITs generally receive conduit income\ntax treatment for income distributed to their owners. 2°\n\nA QRS is a corporation (or trust or other association taxable as a corporation) which is wholly\nowned by a REIT and does not elect with its owner to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. “\nA QRS is not treated as a separate corporation, and, like a QSub, its assets, liabilities, and items\nof income, deductions, and credit are treated as those of the REIT owner. # Thus, the corporate\nstatus of a QRS is generally ignored for federal tax purposes. As with QSubs, however, there are\ncertain regulatory exceptions to the general rule that a QRS is disregarded for federal tax\n\npurposes.\n\nGeneral Exceptions and Modifications\n\nThe number of exceptions and modifications to the general rule that DREs are treated as \"tax\nnothings” has quietly increased over the last decade. A survey of some of the more prevalent\nexceptions and modifications to the general rule follows.\n\nEmployment and Excise Taxes.\n\nShortly after the check-the-box regulations and the QSub rules were issued in the late 1990s,\nthe IRS issued Notice 99-6. # This Notice announced the IRS's intention to issue guidance on the\nproper method for DREs to report employment taxes. It also sought public comment on the\nissue. Notice 99-6 set forth two methods for reporting and paying employment tax for DREs until\nthe IRS issued its guidance. The temporary guidance said that the IRS would accept reporting\nand payment of employment taxes with respect to SMLLC or QSub employees if either of the\nfollowing occurred:\n\n(1) The owner calculated, reported, and paid all employment tax obligations with respect\nto the DRE's employees under its own name and taxpayer identification number.\n\n(2) The DRE separately calculated, reported, and paid all employment tax obligations\nwith respect to its employees under the owner's own name and taxpayer identification\nnumber.\n\nDespite allowing a DRE to separately calculate, report, and pay employment tax obligations with\nrespect to its employees, Notice 99-6 said that the owner would, nonetheless, retain ultimate\nresponsibility for the employment tax obligations incurred with respect to the DRE's employees.\n\nAfter almost six years, the IRS issued proposed regulations governing the treatment of DREs for\nemployment tax and related reporting purposes. #2 In August 2007, the IRS finalized the\nproposed regulations with a few minor modifications. 2° Reg. 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv) treats eligible\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026586",
