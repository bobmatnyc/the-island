  "text": "the Palestinians, though the effort did\nnot succeed. Nor did we succeed\n(Rabin and Peres, myself, Olmert and\nBibi as well). They shouldn't be\nridiculed and debased for this. They\nshould be appreciated. Even if we do\nnot agree on all the details.\n\n¢ We will yet need their help in\nfacing many trials in the future.\n\n¢ J recommend that we all\nremember this well. The rules of\nworking with the Americans: Do not\nmarginalize yourself. Do not fold. Yes\n— remember what the U.S. is for Israel.\nAnd Maintain—at almost any cost —\nmutual relations of trust and respect.\nIt's good for Israel.\n\n¢ The American Congress,\nPresident Obama, Biden and Kerry are\npart of the solution, even if it tarries.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029379",
