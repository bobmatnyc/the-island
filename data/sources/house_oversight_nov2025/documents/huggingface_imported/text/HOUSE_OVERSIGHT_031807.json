After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of\nfocus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear from\nmanagement as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger.\n\nThis morning the pricing is as follows:\n\nAug 200 Puts cost $4.10\nSept 200 Puts cost $7.90\n\nEarning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept puts.\nHowever | still prefer buying the Aug puts as | would fully expect more clarity from management before August expiry.\n\nPaul\n\nPaul Barrett\nAlpha Group Capital LLC\n142 W 57\" Street, 11° Floor, New York, NY 10019\n\nCX SrA cee\nCAPITAL\n\nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>\nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 7:11 AM\n\nTo: Paul Barrett i: Richard Kahn\n\nSubject: -\n\nIm not angry, sorry, itissad. itis apparent that you have no experience trading. we both madeamistake. . the\nspy trades were the results of arank amatuer... youtook a postion on the direction of the market. ok. you\ndecided to play it extra short time and short. . why? becaue the options are cheaper. ? knowing full well that time\npremium was running. . first silly move. . | allowed as promised to give you authority. . you seta target. . it hit the\ntraget , you moved in back. based on media reporting on trump visit? you didnt act. the market dipped and you\npanicked. .
