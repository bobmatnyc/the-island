  "text": "in the PUA community to avoid associating themselves with anything resembling\nfeminist thought or woman-friendly perspectives.\n\nClearly, many men view pickup artistry as a kind of therapy. The community can be a\nsupport group for self-confidence and self-improvement. Unfortunately, many corners of\nthe seduction community are also a support group for virulent misogyny. Some feminists\nargue that any man who seeks self-help through the seduction community is effectively\nembracing misogyny, because so much of the community is misogynist. However, some\nPUA students could be interpreted as seeking self-help from the only avenue they see as\nacceptable, if they are coming from a culture that usually defines self-help as un-\nmasculine or anti-masculine. Again, note that Neil Strauss said: \"self-help isn't\nemasculating anymore if you're doing it to get laid.”\n\nThe most confusing thing about misogyny among PUAs is that although some more-\nmisogynist PUAs separate themselves consciously from non-misogynist PUAs, and vice\nversa, the groups still overlap a great deal. Even PUA-influenced men who prioritize non-\nmisogyny, and are willing to talk to a feminist writer like me, often seem to soak up\nmisogynist ideas from the rest of the subculture. At one point, I talked to one PUA I\nthought was committed to being non-sexist... until he expounded quite seriously upon\nhow his favorite PUA blogger thinks the USA would be better off if women did not vote.\nOne goal of my book, Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser, is to draw clearer lines: to\ngive examples of PUAs and PUA approaches that seem more abusive or inclined towards\nharm, as opposed to approaches that seem mostly playful, harmless or even positive.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nAlthough I want to cry when I see statements like, \"If it wasn't for the pussy, there would\nbe a bounty on women,” I try not to let it distract me from some insights emerging from\nthe seduction community. By focusing empirically and pragmatically on the process of\nsexual escalation, PUAs are approaching gender norms in a way that many people --\nincluding feminists -- usually do not. Also, I can relate to some PUAs because some\nPUAs have the same history of social anxiety that I do.\n\nI have another personal reason for feeling uncomfortable painting PUAs as \"the enemy.”\nWhen feminists criticize how PUAs approach sexuality, I have mixed feelings, because I\nmyself am known for sexual desires that are unpopular with some feminists. As I grew\nout of being an awkward little bookworm nerd, as I began dating and exploring my\nsexual needs, I started to understand my sexuality as being heavily involved with BDSM.\n\nConsensual BDSM is a heavily stigmatized type of sexuality, although some sexologists\nhave argued that it might be viewed as a sexual orientation. Many feminists marginalize\nBDSM just as much as the rest of society does -- or more. Famous German feminist Alice\nSchwarzer once said: \"Female masochism is collaboration,” and a recent history of Ms.\nMagazine quotes a co-founding editor who recalls that:\n\nI threatened to leave over a manuscript by a woman who was a former editor of ours\nwho was writing about why she was a masochist and trying to make it an okay choice. I\nwould rather leave than work for a magazine that published that. And we didn't publish\nit.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018668",
