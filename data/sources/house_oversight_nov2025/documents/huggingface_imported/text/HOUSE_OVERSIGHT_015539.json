The false statements that Maxwell made personally, and through her authorized\nagent Gow, not only called Giuffre’s truthfulness and integrity into question, but also exposed\nGiuffre to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and disgrace.\n\n8. Maxwell made her false statements knowing full well that they were completely\nfalse. Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and deliberate malice, the highest\ndegree of awareness of falsity.\n\noD, Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel, as she knew that they were going to\nbe transmitted in writing, widely disseminated on the internet and in print. Maxwell intended her\nfalse statements to be published by newspaper and other media outlets internationally, and they\nwere, in fact, published globally, including within the Southern District of New York.\n\n10. | Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel per se inasmuch as they exposed\nGuuffre to public contempt, ridicule, aversion, and disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in\nthe minds of right-thinking persons.\n\n11. | Maxwell’s false statements also constitute libel per se inasmuch as they tended to\ninjure Giuffre in her professional capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed\nto help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her credibility and reputation\namong members of the community that seeks her help and that she seeks to serve.\n\n12. | Maxwell’s false statements directly stated and also implied that in speaking out\nagainst sex trafficking Giuffre acted with fraud, dishonesty, and unfitness for the task.\nMaxwell’s false statements directly and indirectly indicate that Giuffre lied about being recruited\nby Maxwell and sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell’s false statements were\nreasonably understood by many persons who read her statements as conveying that specific\n\nintention and meaning.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015539",
