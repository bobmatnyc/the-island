  "text": "Defining Intelligence 145\n\ngenerally is thought of as intelligence. IQ tests have been measuring\nintelligence for decades with questions like these:\n\nAt the end of a banquet 10 people shake hands with each other.\nHow many handshakes will there be in total?\n\nA. 100\n\nB. 20\n\nC. 45\n\nD. 50\n\nE. 90\n\nThe day before the day before yesterday is three days after\nSaturday. What day is it today?\n\nA. Monday\n\nB. Tuesday\n\nC. Wednesday\n\nD. Thursday\n\nE. Friday\n\nWhich number should come next in the series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15?\n\nA.8\n\nB. 11\nC, 24\nD. 21\nE, 27\n\nLibrary is to book as book is to\nA, page\nB. copy\nC. binding\nD. cover\n\nIt is a reasonable guess that neither Palin nor her supporters would do\nreally well on questions like these. But the real issue is why questions\nlike these were chosen to be on IQ tests in the first place. Certainly\nour concept of intelligence, and how to measure it, depends on some\nvague sense of mathematical reasoning ability rather than real-life\nsituation reasoning ability.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023891",
