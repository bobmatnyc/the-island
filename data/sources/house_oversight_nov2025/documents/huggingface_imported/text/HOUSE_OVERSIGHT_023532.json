  "text": "16\n\ndone something bold: Acknowledge that the age of Jewish settlement\nis over. He did mention, fleetingly, that certain settlements would be\nset adrift in a theoretical peace deal. But he seemed unaware that he\nwas delivering a speech that could easily have been given 10 years\nago.\n\nIt is not 10 years ago. Israel is now 10 years closer to achieving full\npariah status. And -- in part because the Palestinians lack the patience\nto pursue a strategy of gradual, irreversible entanglement -- a moment\nof truth for Israel is rapidly approaching.\n\nUN Vote\n\nThe Palestinians are seeking a UN vote in September on\nindependence. They will prevail in the General Assembly, though not\nin the Security Council. President Barack Obama, with whom\nNetanyahu just picked a fight, will have to spend a good amount of\npolitical capital to stymie the Palestinian campaign, even though he\nappears to have nothing but contempt for Netanyahu’s lack of vision.\nBut American opposition to this unilateral declaration will be in\nmany ways immaterial. Israel will soon enough be seen by most of\nthe world as the occupier not of disputed territory but of a foreign\ncountry. The Palestinians will wake up to find that a General\nAssembly vote did not, in fact, give them true independence. And\nthen there will be an explosion.\n\nThe Palestinians who are watching Yemenis, Libyans and Syrians\nfighting for their freedom will soon be inspired to once again take up\ntheir own fight.\n\nExistential Threats\n\nNetanyahu, who understands the existential threat posed by Iran, does\nnot seem to understand the nature of this other existential threat. His\nfive predecessors as prime minister -- including Ariel Sharon, whose\nheart did not bleed for Palestinians -- understood it. President Obama\nunderstands it, too.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023532",
