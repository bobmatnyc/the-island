  "text": "6.4 Memory Types and Associated Cognitive Processes in CogPrime 111\n\nCogPrime’s memory types are the declarative, procedural, sensory, and episodic memory\ntypes that are widely discussed in cognitive neuroscience [TCO05], plus attentional memory for\nallocating system resources generically, and intentional memory for allocating system resources\nin a goal-directed way. Table 6.2 overviews these memory types, giving key references and indi-\ncating the corresponding cognitive processes, and also indicating which of the generic patternist\ncognitive dynamics each cognitive process corresponds to (pattern creation, association, etc.).\nFigure 6.7 illustrates the relationships between several of the key memory types in the context\nof a simple situation involving an OpenCogPrime-controlled agent in a virtual world.\n\nIn terms of patternist cognitive theory, the multiple types of memory in CogPrime should be\nconsidered as specialized ways of storing particular types of patterns, optimized for spacetime\nefficiency. The cognitive processes associated with a certain type of memory deal with creating\nand recognizing patterns of the type for which the memory is specialized. While in principle all\nthe different sorts of pattern could be handled in a unified memory and processing architecture,\nthe sort of specialization used in CogPrime is necessary in order to achieve acceptable efficient\ngeneral intelligence using currently available computational resources. And as we have argued\nin detail in Chapter 7, efficiency is not a side-issue but rather the essence of real-world AGI\n(since as Hutter has shown, if one casts efficiency aside, arbitrary levels of general intelligence\ncan be achieved via a trivially simple program).\n\nThe essence of the CogPrime design lies in the way the structures and processes associated\nwith each type of memory are designed to work together in a closely coupled way, yielding coop-\nerative intelligence going beyond what could be achieved by an architecture merely containing\nthe same structures and processes in separate “black boxes.”\n\nThe inter-cognitive-process interactions in OpenCog are designed so that\n\ne conversion between different types of memory is possible, though sometimes computation-\nally costly (e.g. an item of declarative knowledge may with some effort be interpreted\nprocedurally or episodically, etc.)\n\ne when a learning process concerned centrally with one type of memory encounters a situation\nwhere it learns very slowly, it can often resolve the issue by converting some of the relevant\nknowledge into a different type of memory: i.e. cognitive synergy\n\n6.4.1 Cognitive Synergy in PLN\n\nTo put a little meat on the bones of the \"cognitive synergy\" idea, discussed repeatedly in prior\nchapters and more extensively in latter chapters, we now elaborate a little on the role it plays\nin the interaction between procedural and declarative learning.\n\nWhile MOSES handles much of CogPrime’s procedural learning, and CogPrime’s internal\nsimulation engine handles most episodic knowledge, CogPrime’s primary tool for handling\ndeclarative knowledge is an uncertain inference framework called Probabilistic Logic Networks\n(PLN). The complexities of PLN are the topic of a lengthy technical monograph [GMIT08], and\nare summarized in Chapter 34; here we will eschew most details and focus mainly on pointing\nout how PLN seeks to achieve efficient inference control via integration with other cognitive\nprocesses.\n\nAsa logic, PLN is broadly integrative: it combines certain term logic rules with more standard\npredicate logic rules, and utilizes both fuzzy truth values and a variant of imprecise probabilities\ncalled indefinite probabilities. PLN mathematics tells how these uncertain truth values propagate\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013027",
