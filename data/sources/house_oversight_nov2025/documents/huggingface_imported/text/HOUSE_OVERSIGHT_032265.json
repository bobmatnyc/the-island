He seems very interested in \nyour relationship with the news media. I told him you were a hell of a guy:) One oddity: he said he \nhad been told that that quote from Trump about you in the original NY Mag story had been \nmanufactured. ie, that I did not actually speak to Donald. Which is bull shit of course. I am sure \nthat is what Trump told him as they have been getting a lot of questions from reporters about you. \nHe actually seemed to be a sensible guy/solid reporter -- just from the few conversations I had with \nhim.
