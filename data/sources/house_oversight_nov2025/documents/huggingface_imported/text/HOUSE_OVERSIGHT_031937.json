Zawahiri, by contrast, favored\nan opportunistic strategy of smaller strikes.\n\ne Bin Laden was a hands-on chief executive, with a role in operations\nplanning and personnel decisions, rather than the detached senior\nleader that U.S. analysts had hypothesized. Zawahiri, whom the\nanalysts had imagined as the day-to-day leader, was actually quite\nisolated — and remains so, despite a dozen communications this\nyear. Zawahiri suffers from mistrust between his Egyptian faction of\nal-Qaeda and other operatives, such as Atiyah.\n\neBin Laden was suffering badly from drone attacks on al-Qaeda’s\nbase in the tribal areas of Pakistan. He called this the “intelligence\nwar,” and said it was “the only weapon that’s hurting us.” His cadres\ncomplained that they couldn’t train in the tribal areas, couldn’t\ncommunicate, couldn’t travel easily and couldn’t draw new recruits\nto what amounted to a free-fire zone. Bin Laden discussed moving al-\nQaeda’s base to another location, but he never took action.\n\nAnalysts did not find in the material any smoking gun to suggest\nPakistani government complicity in bin Laden’s presence in\nAbbottabad. And it’s clear he was paranoid about being found and\nkilled: He ordered his subordinates to restrict movements to help\npreserve what remained of al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Fear of being\ndiscovered was a subject of regular conversation between bin Laden,\nAtiyah, Zawahiri and others.\n\nBin Laden also worried that al-\n\nQaeda’s status among Muslims was dwindling, and that the West had\nat least partially succeeded in distancing al-Qaeda’s message from\ncore Islamic values. Concerned about this eroding base, bin Laden\ncounseled affiliates in North Africa and Yemen to hold back on their\nefforts to develop a local Islamic extremist state in favor of attacking\nthe United States and its interests.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031937",
