Chinese subjects,\nrepresentative of a collectivistic and inter-dependent society, responded more quickly to seeing their\nboss’s face than seeing their own face. In contrast, American subjects responded more quickly to their\nown face than to any other person’s face, including that of their boss. Like Platt’s monkeys, therefore, we\ntoo place value on social information. Unlike Platt’s monkeys, our sense of value in the social domain is\nmodulated by our cultural upbringing. This modulation, and the brain states that accompany it, shows up\nin direct comparisons of individuals who are motivated to attain high dominance status with those who\nare motivated to create equality.\n\nThe American social psychologist Joan Chiao used survey information to establish two groups of\nindividuals based on those who preferred to live in an egalitarian society and those who preferred a\nhierarchical society. These individuals then entered a brain scanner and viewed pictures of people\nexperiencing pain. Two areas, both associated with the personal experience of pain and the perception of\npain in others, were highly active. But these areas were less active in those who preferred hierarchies\nthan those who preferred egalitarianism. This finding, as Chiao notes, is consistent with the idea that in\nan egalitarian society, empathy for others well-being is essential. In egalitarian societies, seeing someone\nwho has less or is being harmed by another, should motivate a desire to redress the imbalance and reduce\nthe harm. In a dog-eat-dog hierarchical society, where dominants outcompete subordinates and inequities\nare part of life, concern for those at the bottom is a sign of weakness. These results show how cultural\ninfluences can shape brain activity, leading some to develop deep desires for dominance and inequities,\nwhereas others develop deep desires for equality. These brain areas heighten our sensitivity to what others\nhave, what we desire, and how our desires are modulated by what others have. These comparisons\nmotivate us to improve our status either by working harder — a good thing — or taking down those\n\nabove us —a bad thing.\n\nI'll have what she’s having\n\nOne of the most famous lines in movie history was delivered by Estelle Reiner in When Harry Met Sally,\na comedy produced by her son Rob Reiner. While Estelle is seated at a table in a delicatessen, Sally —\nplayed by Meg Ryan — fakes having an orgasm to show Harry — played by Billy Crystal — that he\ncan’t tell the difference between fakes and the real deal. Overhearing Ryan’s performance, Estelle turns\n\nto the waiter and says “I’ll have what she’s having.” This is comparative shopping, cashing in on\n\nHauser Chapter 2.
