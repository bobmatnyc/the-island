I think they would be happy knowing that their\nhourly rate will be paid when it is billed. The concern is, if all 40 girls decide they want to sue,\nthey don’t want to be in a situation where Mr. Epstein says this is getting too expensive, we won’\nt pay any more attorneys’ fees.\n\n‘wo suggestions, that I] haven't run past Bert, are:\n\ni. Mr. Epstein signs a standard fee agreement, where one of his attorneys or\naccountants whe is not working on the damages litigation receives a monthly bill with\nattorney's fees charged at an hourly rate and cosis billed monthly. The bills will have\nany privileged information redacted. If there is a dispute about a bill that cannot be\nresolved, it will be submitted to a mediator for resolution.\n\n2. If that is too open-ended for Mr. Epstein, do the hourly/monthily billing until Bert\nhas had a chance to confer with all of the girls to determine how many want him to\nrepresent them. Once it is known how many girls will be represented by Bert, and mayhe\nwho those girls are, there can be a more educated discussion about estimated fees and\ncosts.\n\nJust some food for thought. I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be reachable by cell\nphone. I will make sure Bert is available and confirm the time with you.\n\nA, Marie Villafafia\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney\n\n500 S.
