It\nshows a list with \"Homosexual Agenda” written at the top. The list items are: \"1. Spend\ntime with family, 2. Be treated equally, 3. Buy milk.” (You can also buy a keychain\nversion.)\n\nI love that because it so perfectly highlights how preposterous all those right-wing\naccusations about \"the gay agenda\" are. Actually, gay people just want to live their lives\nlike everyone else; the to-do list for most gay people looks a lot like most other people's.\n\nIn a way, that sticker also highlights some problems with the very concept of sexual\norientations -- the way we sort ourselves into groups based on sexuality and its apparent\ninnateness. Why do people have to insist on being so different from each other? A\nquestion that sometimes gets raised in BDSM contexts: is BDSM a \"sexual orientation\"?\nAnd I have such mixed feelings about that question. I feel intense BDSM as an incredibly\nimportant aspect of my sexuality, perhaps an innate one, but I don't want us to fall into\nthe same traps that beset homosexuality.\n\nI remember the first moment it occurred to me to consider BDSM an orientation -- the\nfirst time I used that word. I believe I was writing up my coming-out story at the time; I\nwas discussing the way I freaked out when I came into BDSM, and I wrote: Jn\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018531",
