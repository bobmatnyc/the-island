  "text": "102 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\n\ncontained in a police file in a civil proceeding, even though it appears that\nthere was little indication that criminal charges had been filed.”*8 Similarly,\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court, while limiting the ability of the victim\nto challenge the conduct of a prosecutor, concluded that the same rights\nunder the state constitution must attach prior to the formal filing of an\nindictment.” Other courts have even permitted a victim to recover\ncompensation or reparations for unindicted or acquitted conduct.**°\n\nIn other words, while few state judiciaries have addressed the precise\ntiming of state crime victims’ rights, those that have addressed the question\nhave typically found that the rights do extend to pre-charging situations.\n\nDespite the relative dearth of state court cases, it is worth noting that\nmost state statutes unequivocally provide for notification rights early in the\ncriminal process.”! For example, the Illinois statute imposes a limited duty\non law enforcement agencies to keep victims informed of the status of an\ninvestigation until the accused is apprehended or the agency discontinues\nthe investigation.’ Similarly, law enforcement agencies in Iowa must\nkeep the victim apprised of the investigation “until the alleged assailant is\napprehended or the investigation is closed.””°? Michigan’s statute requires\nlaw enforcement to provide information within a mere twenty-four hours of\ncontact between the agency and the victim.”\n\nIn sum, while state law on crime victims’ rights before charging is not\nfully developed, what law exists tends to support the position that crime\nvictims deserve rights before the formal filing of charges. This law fits the\nlong-standing trend in states toward expanding protections for crime\n\n48 See In re James B., Jr., 714 A.2d 735 (Conn. Super. Ct. 1998).\n\n49 See Ex parte Littlefield, 540 S.E.2d 81, 85 (S.C. 2000).\n\n250 See Kimberly J. Winbush, Annotation, Persons or Entities Entitled to Restitution as\n“Victim” Under State Criminal Restitution Statute, 92 A.L.R. 5TH 35, 35 (2001) (recounting\ncases in which unnamed victims were entitled to restitution).\n\n°51 See, e.g., MINN. STAT. ANN. § 611A.0315(a) (West 2009) (requiring a prosecutor to\n“make every reasonable effort to notify a victim of domestic assault ... or harassment that\nthe prosecutor has decided to decline prosecution of the case” but providing the right to\nparticipate in proceedings to circumstances in which the offender has been charged).\n\n252 See 725 ILL. Comp. STAT. ANN. 120/4.5 (2008).\n\n253 Towa CODE ANN. § 915.13(1)(f) (West 2003).\n\n254 See Micu. Comp. LAws ANN. § 780.753 (West 2007). Michigan’s conferral right is\nparticularly ambiguous, because the notification requirement imposed upon the prosecuting\nattorney contains a time limitation (after arraignment), but the legislature did not include an\nexpress time limitation on the conferral right. See Micu. Comp. Laws ANN. § 780.756(3)\n(West 2007) (requiring the victim have the opportunity to consult prior to “any negotiation\nthat may result in a dismissal, plea or sentence bargain, or pretrial diversion”); see also Miss.\nCoDE ANN. § 99-43-7(1) (2007) (imposing a requirement on law enforcement officials to\nnotify a victim within seventy-two hours).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014081",
