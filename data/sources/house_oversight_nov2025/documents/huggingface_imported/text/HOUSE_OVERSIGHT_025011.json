  "text": "Article 4.\n\nSpiegel\n\"What's Wrong with the Palestinians\nAppealing to the UN?'\n\nAn interview with Arab League Head Nabil Elaraby\n\nPro-democracy uprisings are continuing in the Middle East and the\nPalestinians could soon declare statehood. SPIEGEL spoke with\nArab League General Secretary Nabil Elaraby about the Syrian\nregime's use of violence against protesters and how the US has failed\nto force Israel to negotiate in good faith.\n\nSPIEGEL: Libya has been liberated from Moammar Gadhafi's\nautocratic rule. Tensions in Syria, meanwhile, have already claimed\nmore civilian lives than the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia\ncombined, and yet the Arab League is holding back. Why are you\ngoing easy on the Syrian regime?\n\nElaraby: Syria isn't Libya. Libya has always been largely isolated.\nWhat happened there had little effect on neighboring countries. It's a\ncompletely different situation with Syria. The country holds a key\nposition in the region. What happens there has a direct impact on\nLebanon and Iraq. In addition, Gadhafi used heavy weapons from the\nstart, but Assad hasn't.\n\nSPIEGEL: Yet tanks have been deployed in Hama, Homs and\nLatakia for some time.\n\nElaraby: When I flew to Syria 10 days after taking office, they also\ntried to tell me that there had been no riots in Aleppo or Damascus. I\nwas told that gun battles had only occurred in a few towns near the\nborder, because rebels had fired on security forces there.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025011",
