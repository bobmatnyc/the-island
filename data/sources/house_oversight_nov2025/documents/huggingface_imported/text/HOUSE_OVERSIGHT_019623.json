It provided a valuable window on the\nactivities of adversary nations in the Pacific region and was able to\nmonitor the ballistic missile tests and submarine activities of China,\nNorth Korea, and Russia. By 2013, the Kunia base had a vast array\nof state-of-the-art technology, including ninety Cray supercom-\nputers arranged in a horseshoe configuration, used to decipher and\nmake sense of the intercepted signals from China, Russia, and North\nKorea. At the heart of the Hawaiian complex was a unit with both\nmilitary and civilian employees. A large share of the civilians who\nran the computers worked under two-year contracts with the NSA’s\nleading civilian contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\nGeneral Alexander, who, as I said, headed the NSA in 2013, first\nlearned about an impending story in The Guardian on June 4, while\nhe was in Germany meeting with its top intelligence officials, from\nJanine Gibson, The Guardian’s American website editor. She had\nnotified the NSA it intended to break a story focusing on the organi-\nzation. It took NSA counterintelligence less than forty-eight hours\nto determine that a civilian employee at the base from which docu-\n\n© ments were stolen had not reported back to work on May 22. His ©\ncivilian supervisor had delayed reporting the absence to the NSA\nuntil May 28. It also determined that the missing civilian employee,\nSnowden, had lied on his application for a medical leave and had\nflown to Hong Kong. Personal records showed he was being trained\nas an analyst at the Threat Operations Center and had worked there\nfor less than six weeks. He had taken the medical leave on May 18\nand left the country by plane. By June 6, he had become the NSA’s\nmain suspect.\n\nAlexander flew to Washington, D.C., after assigning the sensi-\ntive job of investigating the breach to a team headed by Richard\n“Rick” Ledgett, who was then director of the NSA’s Threat Opera-\ntions Center at the NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland.\nLedgett was the logical choice to head the damage assessment inves-\ntigation because the center’s regional branch in Hawaii was under\nhis command. Ledgett flew to Hawaii, where his first task was to\nreconstruct the chronology of Snowden’s moves, or, as the tactic is\ncalled in counterintelligence parlance, “walking the cat back.”\n\nThe NSA had also notified the FBI of Snowden’s possible involve-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 135 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019623",
