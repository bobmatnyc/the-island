  "text": "Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and\nDepression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders.\nThis is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact\nthat REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of\ndreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is ‘down-regulated’ (and the frontal cortex is associated with\nrational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is “up-regulated”\n(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is\n\nwhy dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that\nthe limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and\ndreams can enhance creativity.\n\nAs Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: “It would be nice if we could talk about sleep\nand memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case.\nSleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of\npost-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.”\n\nImmunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep.\nDiscerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (1.e., it seems counter-intuitive\n\nthat sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that\ngoing unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various\nnon-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a\nstronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that\n\nfight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This\ngives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are “genetic conflict” studies\nwith respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and\ndifferences between males and females in which genes get “imprinted”.\n\nNeuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new\nneurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a\nvital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in\nthe hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in\n\nthe hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why\nREM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning).\n\nDream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only\nin very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and\nstatistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories,\nincluding cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size\nand structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time.\nPatterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways.\nMales will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers\n\nare often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness\nby the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.)\n“Lucid Dreaming” is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer “knows” that\nhe/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be\ntrained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering\ntheir brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below).\n\nNeuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is\nitself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now\nenables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In\n\nREM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is “down-regulated”, whereas the limbic system is “up-regulated”,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025107",
