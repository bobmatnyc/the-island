  "text": "I understood. Of course I understood. I knew intellectually that it wasn't about me, I knew\nit was just about the situations at hand, but of course it hurt anyway. Two awesome men,\ngiving me the same message at once: This is too much, you're too extreme. A matter of\ntheir boundaries. Not about me. Of course it hurt anyway.\n\n\"Is there anything else you want to add while we're having this conversation?\" I asked\nThe Artist finally, as we wound things up.\n\nHe thought for a minute, took my hand. \"Well, you're wonderful and beautiful, but you\nknow that.”\n\n\"Do I?\" Tasked, and made myself laugh to take the sting from my words.\n\nKOK ok\n\nAn aside:\n\nOccasionally, my mother has tried to convince me that I am at emotional risk in part\nbecause of the fact that I am forward about my sexuality. Because -- I think this is how\nthe story goes, though she's never explicitly articulated it -- because it means that men\nwill see me as a disposable toy; the hot edgy girl he likes but would never settle down\nwith; the whore but not the Madonna. Cute enough to catch his attention and passionate\nenough that he'll call her back but ultimately, not \"the keeper\", not the girl he'd have any\nloyalty to in the end. I think my mom is afraid that I'll stumble out the other end of this\nbrilliant razor-edged fluorescent beautiful funhouse that is my \"young and attractive\"\nyears, that I'll come down like a girl falling through a distorted mirrored sheet of glass.\nThat shards will burst everywhere and I'll collapse, covered in metaphorical blood, and\nturn my eyes up to the harsh white stars and wonder how I let men use me and why.\n\nThis is the stereotype that I think she's afraid of, on my behalf, the one that comes up on\noccasion when she comforts me through heartbreak. My mother is hardly a conservative\nslut-shamer, but she loves me and she wants to protect me, so she tells me this. And I'll\nadmit it -- I fear it too, I feel those anxieties whispering behind me, thrumming through\nmy veins during times like these. What did I mean to him? Did I matter, did I make an\nimpression, does he give a damn? Would he be willing to Make A Commitment? He\ndoesn't care, God, I don't matter, and I was just stupid because God forbid I allow myself\nto like or trust a man that I fuck, when everyone knows that men don't ever have feelings\nfor the women they fuck --\n\nBut actually those fears don't make sense, do they -- they don't make any sense at all if I\nassume that men are complex humans who want to have relationships but aren't always\nsure about it (much like myself), rather than sex-seeking-stereotype-activated-robots. The\nfears don't make sense in the context of my own experience, which is full of friends and\nrelatives and lovers who have been caring, self-aware, honest men. The fears don't make\nsense given the fact that very often, I'm the one who prefers not to have a serious\nrelationship right now, or who can only compromise up to a point.\n\nAnd the fears especially don't make any damn sense if we assume that I want to pursue\nmy own goals, my own dreams, my own pleasures, my own sexuality on my own terms.\nIf we assume that I have no intention of playing by the rules in a world that tells me\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018528",
