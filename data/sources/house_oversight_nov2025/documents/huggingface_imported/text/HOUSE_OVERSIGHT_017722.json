However, these efforts have failed to fully\nsafeguard victims’ rights. These significant state efforts simply are not sufficiently consistent, comprehensive, or authoritative\nto safeguard victims' rights. ©\n\nTo place victims’ rights in the Constitution, victims advocates - led most prominently by the National Victims Constitutional\n\nAmendment Network % - approached the President and Congress regarding a federal amendment. © On April 22, 1996,\nSenators Kyl and Feinstein with the backing of President Clinton introduced a federal victims' rights amendment. © The\namendment was intended to \"restore, preserve, and protect, as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the practice of\nvictim participation in the administration of criminal justice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of our\nNation.\" ©” A companion resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives. ©8 The proposed amendment embodied\nseven core principles: (1) the right to notice of proceedings, (2) the right to be present at the proceedings, (3) the right to be\nheard, (4) the right to notice of the defendant's [*849] release or escape, (5) the right to restitution, (6) the right to a speedy\ntrial, and (7) the right to reasonable protection. In a later resolution, an eighth principle was added: the right to standing to\nenforce these rights. ©? The 104th Congress did not pass the amendment.\n\nOn January 21, 1997, the opening day of the first session of the 105th Congress, Senators Kyl and Feinstein reintroduced the\nvictims’ rights amendment. ™ A series of hearings were held that year in both the House and the Senate. 7! Kyl and Feinstein\nreintroduced the amendment the following year. 7* The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings 73 and passed the proposed\namendment out of committee. 4 Yet again, the full Senate did not consider the amendment.\n\nIn 1999, Senators Kyl and Feinstein again proposed the amendment, > and on September 30, 1999, the Judiciary Committee\nvoted, as before, to send the amendment to the full Senate. 7 But on April 27, 2000, after three days of floor debate, the\namendment was shelved when it became clear that its opponents, who objected to constitutionalizing victims’ rights, possessed\n\nthe necessary votes to sustain a filibuster. 77 At the same time, hearings on the companion measure were held in the House. 7°\n\n® Focusing on the Administration of Justice and the Enforcement of Laws: Dep't of Justice Oversight Hearing Before the S.
