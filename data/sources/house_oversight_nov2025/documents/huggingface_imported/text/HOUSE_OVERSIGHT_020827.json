  "text": "Third, the report highlights how powerful bipartisan constituencies have emerged in the past to\ntackle great issues for the betterment of our nation, including tax reform, civil liberties,\nhealthcare, education and national defense. Just as presidents of both parties rose to the\noccasion to preside over the difficult process of containment during the half-century cold war, we\nknow we can still find leaders who are willing to step up and overcome political or philosophical\ndifferences for a good cause, even in these difficult times.\n\nFinally, the report makes an important contribution to the question of timing. Momentum will\nfollow once the process begins to gain support, and USA Inc. should help by stimulating broad\nrecognition and understanding of the challenges, by providing ways to think about solutions, and\nby helping constituencies of action to emerge. As the old saying goes, “If not now, when? If not\nus, who?”\n\nWith this pioneering report, we have a refreshing, business-minded approach to understanding\nand addressing our nation’s future. Read on...you may be surprised by how much you learn. We\nhope you will be motivated to help solve the problem!\n\nCB www.kpcb.com USA Inc. — iv\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020827",
