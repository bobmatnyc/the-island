  "text": "who required all new patients to take a two-session course in flossing and\noral health. Only when he was satisfied that patients would be capable of\ncaring for their teeth properly would he then make their first cleaning\nappointment. Nancy learned the technique, and recently a friend named\nher “the Floss Queen.” We came across an ad stating that “If you follow\na vegan diet, you may opt for Eco-Dent’ s GentleFloss, which uses\n\nbeeswax instead of animal products.” Who knew?\n\nThe irony behind all this is that Medicare doesn’ t cover any dental\nprocedures, even though dentists emphasize how bad teeth can cause\nillness in other, internal parts of the body. For example, a research team\nfrom Columbia University’ s School of Public Health released the results of\na three-year study of 420 men and women, concluding that the\nimprovement of gum health can help slow the development of\natherosclerosis, the build-up of cholesterol-rich plaque along artery walls,\nwhich can lead to heart attacks and strokes.\n\n| still regret that | would eat candy without flossing afterward.\n\nEspecially a Clark Bar, which could cause a cavity andfill it simultaneously.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015455",
