  "text": "drives with meaningless ones and zeros, spread onto millions of computers. Once a\nmachine was infected the overwrite command would activate every year on March\n6th — a twisted celebration of the birthday of the great Renaissance artist. But\nbecause the program operated at the BIOS level - the basic input/output heart of\nthose early machines - it was nearly impossible to eradicate. Computer security\ncompanies, soon to be known as computer “insecurity” companies because they\nwere (and are) constantly behinder, responded with the following rather\n\nunconvincing advice: Turn your machine off on March 5, Turn it back on March\n7th 132\n\nEven the biggest, most powerful companies were shipping programs packed with\npotential problems, cracks that were often baked into the design of a system,\ninvisible even to their makers. A couple of years after the Hac-Tic conference, for\nexample, a popular word processing program included a feature that could permita\nsurreptitious hacker to make a computer to execute all sorts of nefarious commands\nonce a user had opened a harmless-looking document. This was sort of like shipping\nhundreds of millions of door locks that would pop easily open for criminals who\nknew to ask. Did you use a word processor in the 1990s? Likely your machine faced\nthis danger: You’d open a note from a friend or a memo from your boss and you'd\nthen instantly, unstoppably forfeit control of your computer, even if you didn’t know\nor see or feel the impact for years. That problem was fixed - companies learned to\nissue what became known as “patches” to plug the inadvertent leaks in their\nsystems — but that such a danger existed and could be profitably used was a sign of\naruthless evolution. There were billions of dollars, even then, at stake.\n\nAs technology advanced, so did the malware, which was adapting and evolving to\nnew opportunities. Think of how hugely different our experience of machines is\ntoday as opposed to just a few years ago. Hacking has matured as fast - maybe\nfaster. Early attacks were aimed at machines that had, essentially, no defenses.\nPrograms like “Michelangelo” were designed to act much like the viruses of a\ncommon cold or food poisoning. They sickened and then controlled individual\nmachines, devices with no immune systems. Hackers faced a challenge in finding\nways to sneak these digital diseases onto computers, but of course they finally found\nholes. They hid viruses on floppy disks or inside documents or spread-sheets that\nappeared otherwise safe. Intelligence agencies became infamous for passing out\n“free disks” at conferences or littering defense contractor parking lots with infected\nUSB sticks, waiting for some unsuspecting employee to pop them into a computer\nand invisibly activate some bit of carefully installed, hidden malware. Or, in a clever\ncase of “know your target”, sneaking malware into the code of some particularly\nviolent video game, sure to be played by an adrenaline-addled system administrator\nin a fit of afterhours boredom.\n\n132 Turn it back on: For a discussion of Michaelangelo see entry for virus in\nEncyclopedia of Computer Science 4 Ed.
