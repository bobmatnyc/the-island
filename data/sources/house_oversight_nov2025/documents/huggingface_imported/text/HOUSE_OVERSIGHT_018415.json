  "text": "system; it fuses cooperation with brutal competition as it aims for a kind of\nequilibrium. After all, if we were constantly tearing into one another, we'd be\nextinct, not evolved. Why did cities form? Nations? The key is a moment when\nshared, possibly devastating risk of collective failure becomes apparent - those\nmoments when the whole system threatens to collapse right on top of all the\nparticipants. The greater the shared danger, Mezza-Garcia and her colleagues\nexplain, the better the chance for real cooperation. It’s a forumula that fits what we\nface now: “An increased risk of collective failure facilitates large-scale cooperation,\nespecially when the large scale system is composed of smaller, nested groups,” They\nexplain. ““Complex systems theory reveals an alternative to constant conflict.”\n\nThis is our world now: Linked clusters of markets, nations, machines - all exposed\nto arisk of shared and instant collective failure. Such a structure upends an axiom of\npolitics that has run for centuries: Man is purely Darwinian and that survival is\ndetermined by constant competition alone. In a network, survival is determined by\nsociability, by cooperation. Linked systems drive people to agree on rules in order to\nparticipate, which accelerates change and co-evolution. Smart cancer databases,\nlinked traffic systems, video platforms like YouTube - each are Gatelands that press\nusers together on a single platform, one that can be instantly updated and\nconstantly studied for adjustment. “Rich get richer” arrangements are an ideal place\nfor co-evolution, shaped as they are by easy linkage, exchange and connection to\noutside events. As more people follow the logic inside the gates, the system co-\nevolves. It becomes still more fit. It’s this loop that makes Hard Gatekeeping so well\nsuited to an age of connection. We’re not merely putting up walls; gatelands are like\nmarkets or public squares. They are loci for cooperation. In diplomatic history it’s\nnot hard to calls for cooperation. “We must get along or this war will devastate us\nall!” But they don't work. Mostly you find hand-wringing about how terrible war\nwould be followed by, well, war. The logic of networks offers an escape from this sad\nhabit.\n\nCo-evolving relations between the US and China can begin at the most obvious of\nstarting points: Both sides need to change. New pressures are already tearing at\neach. Both nations need a new gatekept system. Our aim isn’t to “balance” China into\nsome sort of frozen checkmate. It’s not to tip her unwisely into chaotic and\nimpoverished domestic order - we are, like it or not, all connected. It is to co-evolve\ntogether. And China? She won’t survive if she does not connect to a system that is\ncongenial to her needs. Fortunately, the networks are infinitely flexible in their\ndesign. A Chinese model and an American model pose no problem of\ninteroperability. This is the best co-evolutionary strategy for each side. The dangers\nwe confront now are everywhere. The habitual American temptation is to break all\nthese risks into pieces, to find out where the problem is, and to flatten each of them:\n“Let’s hit the terrorists, then the Chinese navy, then the Russians, then the drug\nlords.” This will kill us if we keep it up. In a complex system, piecemeal attack\nsimply shocks the system to still greater complexity. The world, rather wonderfully,\nis too flexible for brute force applied at one place. A dynamic defense, is a precursor\n\n183\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018415",
