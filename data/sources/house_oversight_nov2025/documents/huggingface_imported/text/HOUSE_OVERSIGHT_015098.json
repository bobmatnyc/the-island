  "text": "Once | express concern to Bebe that word might get out about my\n“affairs” in Key Biscayne. “These girls,” | pointed out, “are likely to\nbrag about going to bed with a United States senator.”\n“They’ re professionals,” Bebe reassured me. “It’s just like your\nlawyer-client privilege. Stop worrying.”\nkok &\n\nOne evening in 1949, while | was still serving in Congress, | received\nan anonymous call at my home. A male voice said three words, “Watch\nJeane Dixon,” and hung up the telephone.\n\nA week later, the psychic Jeane Dixon held a press conference. One\nof the reporters asked her to predict my future. She drew a blank, however,\nexplaining that she needed time to meditate. | believe that in show\nbusiness parlance this is known as “milking the audience.” Finally she\nsaid it: “| predict that one day Richard Nixon will become president of the\nUnited States.”\n\n| could only conclude that the higher source from which she had\nreceived her intelligence was not necessarily supernatural. When | lost the\npresidential election to John F. Kennedy in 1960, Jeane Dixon continued to\npredict that | would be president. “Destiny,” she said, “cannot be\n\ndenied.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015098",
