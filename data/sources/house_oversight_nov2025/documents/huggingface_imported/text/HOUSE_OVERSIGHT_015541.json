Asa result of Maxwell’s campaign to spread false, discrediting and defamatory\nstatements about Giuffre, Giuffre suffered substantial damages in an amount to be proven at trial.\n\n19. Maxwell’s false statements have caused, and continue to cause, Giuffre economic\ndamage, psychological pain and suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress, and other\ndirect and consequential damages and losses.\n\n20. | Maxwell’s campaign to spread her false statements internationally was unusual\nand particularly egregious conduct. Maxwell sexually abused Giuffre and helped Epstein to\nsexually abuse Giuffre, and then, in order to avoid having these crimes discovered, Maxwell\nwantonly and maliciously set out to falsely accuse, defame, and discredit Giuffre. In so doing,\nMaxwell’s efforts constituted a public wrong by deterring, damaging, and setting back Giuffre’s\nefforts to help victims of sex trafficking. Accordingly, this is a case in which exemplary and\npunitive damages are appropriate.\n\n21. | Punitive and exemplary damages are necessary in this case to deter Maxwell and\nothers from wantonly and maliciously using a campaign of lies to discredit Giuffre and other\nvictims of sex trafficking.\n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Giuffre respectfully requests judgment against Defendant\nMaxwell, awarding compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an\namount to be determined at trial, but in excess of the $75,000 jurisdictional requirement; costs of\n\nsuit; attorneys’ fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.\n\n11\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015541",
