  "text": "Before describing the relatively new set of measures of biological processes\ndesigned to find and quantitate what are assumed to be relatively sample size\ninsensitive, distributionally nonconvergent and multiply correlated processes that\nare without a single time or space scale, we should remind ourselves that there is\nalready much more apparent “order” in a generically random situation than our\nintuitions would lead us to believe. For example, if we keep cumulative scores in a\ncompetition between heads and tails and determine the distribution of trials between\nthose in which the number of heads and tails are even, we will get periods between\nzero crossings of many lengths with very short ones and very (very) long ones\nbeing most statistically prominent. The distribution of these wavelengths is shaped\nlike a symmetrically fat-tailed, bowl (Feller, 1968). As another illustration, expected\nruns of heads or tails in this Gaussian random task are longer and more frequent\nthan we might suspect. It has been proven that the expected run length grows with\nn coin flips (as an order of magnitude estimate) like the logarithm (for a fair coin,\nbase 1/p = 1/0.5 = 2) of n. For example, in 512 ( e.g. 2°) tosses, we cannot report a\nrun of 9 heads as a evidence for a biased coin or the sign of some deterministic\ncoin tossing mechanism (Erdos and Renyi, 1970). If we had a 0.6 head biased coin,\nthen the observation of a run of 13 heads couldn’t dissuade us from a random\n\nmechanism!\n\nUnlike our random coin task, the variances of many, perhaps most, time\nseries of biologically-relevant events, do not tend to converge onto a limiting value\nas sample size, n, grows, but rather continue to increase (or decrease) with n ina\nscale invariant manner. Instead of “regressing to the mean” with increasing sample\nlength or number, the likelinood of a larger deviation than previously observed\nincreases with n. Analyses of inter-event intervals reveals a multiplicity of\ncharacteristic times. One interpretation of these finding might be that this represents\nevidence for the inherent “nonstationarity” of biological mechanisms as reflected in,\nfor examples, the frequency of saccades concomitant with ceaselessly shifting foci\nof visual attention (Steriade and McCarley, 1990), or our inability to not think of\n“white bear’ when so instructed (Wegner, 1994). Hermann Haken, the father of\n\nlaser-inspired “synergetics,” has said that biological mechanisms are not in a steady\n\n207\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013707",
