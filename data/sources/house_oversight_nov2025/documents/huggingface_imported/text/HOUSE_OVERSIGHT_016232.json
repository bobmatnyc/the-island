  "text": "As Judea Pearl, who, in the 1980s, introduced a new approach to artificial\nintelligence called Bayesian networks, explained to me:\n\nWhat Wiener created was excitement to believe that one day we are going to\nmake an intelligent machine. He wasn't a computer scientist. He talked feedback,\nhe talked communication, he talked analog. His working metaphor was a\nfeedback circuit, which he was an expert in. By the time the digital age began in\nthe early 1960s people wanted to talk programming, talk codes, talk about\ncomputational functions, talk about short-term memory, long-term memory—\nmeaningful computer metaphors. Wiener wasn’t part of that, and he didn’t reach\nthe new generation that germinated with his ideas. His metaphors were too old,\npassé. There were new means already available that were ready to capture the\nhuman imagination.” By 1970, people were no longer talking about Wiener.\n\nOne critical factor missing in Wiener’s vision was the cognitive element: mind, thinking,\nintelligence. As early as 1942, at the first of a series of foundational interdisciplinary\nmeetings about the control of complex systems that would come to be known as the\nMacy conferences, leading researchers were arguing for the inclusion of the cognitive\nelement into the conversation. While von Neumann, Shannon, and Wiener were\nconcerned about systems of control and communication of observed systems, Warren\nMcCullough wanted to include mind. He turned to cultural anthropologists Gregory\nBateson and Margaret Mead to make the connection to the social sciences. Bateson in\nparticular was increasingly talking about patterns and processes, or “the pattern that\nconnects.” He called for a new kind of systems ecology in which organisms and the\nenvironment in which they live are one in the same, and should be considered as a single\ncircuit. By the early 1970s the Cybernetics of observed systems—1* order Cybernetics—\nmoved to the Cybernetics of observing systems—2\"™ order Cybernetics—or “the\nCybernetics of Cybernetics”, as coined by Heinz von Foerster, who joined the Macy\nconferences in the mid 1950s, and spearheaded the new movement.\n\nCybernetics, rather than disappearing, was becoming metabolized into everything,\nso we no longer saw it as a separate, distinct new discipline. And there it remains, hiding\nin plain sight.\n\n“The Shtick of the Steins”\n\nMy own writing about these issues at the time was on the radar screen of the 2\"4 order\nCybernetics crowd, including Heinz von Foerster as well as John Lilly and Alan Watts,\nwho were the co-organizers of something called \"The AUM Conference,\" shorthand for\n“The American University of Masters”, which took place in Big Sur in 1973, a gathering\nof philosophers, psychologists, and scientists, each of whom asked to lecture on his own\nwork in terms of its relationship to the ideas of British mathematician G. Spencer Brown\npresented in his book, Laws of Form.\n\nI was a bit puzzled when I received an invitation—a very late invitation indeed—\nwhich they explained was based on their interest in the ideas I presented in a book called\nAfterwords, which were very much on their wavelength. I jumped at the opportunity, the\nmain reason being that the keynote speaker was none other than Richard Feynman. I love\n\n12\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016232",
