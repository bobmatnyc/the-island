These powerful people seem to think that they don’t have to\nfollow the same rules as everyone else. That is wrong. I hope that by coming forward, I can\nhelp expose the problem of sex trafficking and prevent the same sort of abuse and degradation\nthat happened to me from happening to other girls.\n\n63.
