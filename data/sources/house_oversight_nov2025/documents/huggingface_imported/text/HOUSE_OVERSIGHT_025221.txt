White Castle. Twenty five years ago, I had a friend with a peculiar way of responding to seeing things he didn’t like on TV: he
would throw White Castle hamburgers at the screen. I always thought this was a bad way to waste a good hamburger, but I had
one of those moments the other night when watching news reports on debt ceiling discussions. Media outlets have referred to
President Reagan’s scolding of Congressional Republicans for delaying debt ceiling increases, and the 18 increases that took
place during his Presidency. The implication: reservations about raising the debt ceiling are as irresponsible now as they were
then. This is a disingenuous argument; in the 1980’s, the debt ceiling being debated was 50% of GDP, and had no
bearing on the solvency of the United States. Today, the proposed increase raises the debt limit twice as high, measured
relative to GDP or government revenues. While a default is a very bad idea (deserving of a White Castle hurling of its own),
unconstrained debt growth with no plan to slow it is bad as well. Some suggest we not worry about debt growth, since demand
from foreign central banks and the Federal Reserve would keep yields in check. That logic is irresponsible at best. Debt limit
legislation is a rocky but healthy way for a democracy to decide whether mega-deficits are in the long-term public interest.

Over the last few days, the Gang of Six plan, the Reid-McConnell plan and the Obama-Boehner plan have all been
raised up the flagpole and then lowered. By the end of the process, we’re still looking for deficit reduction of $3 trillion+
over 10 years (relative to the CBO Alternative case in which there is no deficit reduction at all). However, Congress is running
short on time, and may have to do a smaller debt ceiling increase/deficit reduction first. For now, we wait to see the balance of
spending cuts and revenue increases’ will be agreed to. Last week’s Profiles in Courage piece walked through the history and
dynamics of this process, so we won’t repeat that here. Here’s our take on what has been proposed so far, with the caveat
that many plans are not crystal clear what baseline they are using’, or what steps they recommend to get to that baseline first.

What's on the menu? US long-term debt scenarios All tax cuts extended; AMT indexed to inflation;

CBO Baseline

On the AMT: the Tax Policy Center estimates that if the AMT is not indexed to inflation, it would impact 31 million filers in 2012 (and
raise $132 billion in revenue), compared to 4 million filers in 2011 (and $39 billion in revenue).
* For example: the Gang of Six state that they used the President’s budget as a baseline (scored by CBO in March 201 1), reduced deficits by

$3.7 trillion, and ended up with a 71% debt/GDP ratio; but they do not explain how they get to the President’s baseline in the first place. 1
