The collapse of Arab\nautocracies and the impending conflagration in Pakistan should serve\nas wake-up calls for policymakers in Washington.\n\nInstead of indiscriminately throwing its weight around and\nunconditionally cultivating ties with intransigent allies such as Israel\nand Saudi Arabia, the United States should be looking toward further\ncooperation with powerful and democratizing countries such as\nTurkey and Egypt. Maintenance and deepening of close ties with\nlegitimate states with civilian governments committed to democracy\nand economic development is the best way for the United States to\ncreate islands of peace in different regions and construct durable\nmultilateral arrangements, which serve common interests.\n\nSuch strategic patience could also rehabilitate the battered U.S. image\naround the globe. For instance, Brazil’s case is very instructive: the\nrise of a democratic and progressive government, under President\nLuiz Ignacio Lula da Silva, ushered in a new era of stability and\neconomic progress. Today, Brazil is sharing the responsibilities of\nhemispheric leadership with the United States and contributing to\nregional stability and integration. The lesson is simple: reliance on\nresponsible regional powers is America’s best chance for a smooth\ntransition to a truly multipolar global system. Egypt can and should\nbe just such a partner.\n\nForeign Policy In Focus contributor Richard Javad Heydarian is a\nforeign affairs analyst based in Manila.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030177",
