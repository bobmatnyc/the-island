  "text": "might safely open, develop, and change. They mixed the crouching nervousness of a\nsecret political party with the vivid nightmares of a nation that had been invaded,\nabused — humiliated, they said - by nine countries since the mid-19\" Century Opium\nWars. “We used to worry about war and talk about its possibility every year,” Deng\ntold them. “It seems the worry was overdone.” The world was, he felt, entering an\nera of heping yu fazhan - peace and development. Terrible, nation-demolishing wars\nwould not soon victimize China, Deng thought. Nation building was the nature of the\nage. Its tools would be science, finance, and trade. If the Chinese people worked\nhard, he promised his incredulous listeners, they might by the year 2000 grow their\nthin $250 per capita income to the nearly unimaginable target of $1000. “I don’t\ncare if the cat is white or black,” he famously observed, “as long as it catches mice.”\nSocialism? Capitalism? No matter so long as it produced progress. Deng’s judgment\nproved out. There were no major wars. Development was, for China, the name of the\nage. The cat caught $1000 dollars of per capita income nearly on the old man’s\nschedule. It is still playing with the string.\n\nThere is something admirably direct about the Western way of problem solving, of\ncourse. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. It has its uses. But\nit’s also true that this sort of elementary geometry does not describe, always, the\nbest path. Particularly not today, in an era when topological collapse or instant\nconnection means that the distance from a to b can go to zero (or infinity) in a single\nsudden shift. Yes, you may be stringing a line from a to b, but if you’re putting it up\nin a tornado? Is the best route to a new Middle East really the tipping over of stable\nstates? Is the quickest path to climate control voluntary compacts? Are faster\nmarkets and more unwatched capitalism the safest way to ameliorate our\nunbalanced economics? Sometimes a more indirect line is called for. Sometimes it is\nfaster, safer. Huang Hua’s question - “Where is the world going, after all?” - turns\nout to be the first essential one for any endeavor. Ifyou are not looking from the\nhighest possible altitude, Chinese will warn you, you are not seeing the full picture.\n\nThe nature of our age has, | think, emerged clearly, vividly and broadly for us now.\nConstant, instant, everywhere connectivity taps with the efficient mercilessness of a\nsteel hammer on the glass of most of our comfortable institutions. The Seventh\nSense has let us understand a bit about the origins of this creative violence. And it\nhas shown us too that our era’s dominant feature is not merely cracking disruption,\nbut also the construction of new orders. Da po, Da li the Chinese might say - great\ndestruction and great construction. This is the nature of our age. Tap, tap, crack. And\nthen: Gatelands - speed-bred by technology and filled with possibility. That some of\nthese gated worlds contain billions of people or trillions of sensors, computer chips\nor network nodes only strengthens their inexorable grip. That they can be so easily\nor even accidentally weaponized marks the edginess of our problem. That they will\nbe built atop the sharp-edged shards of a collapsing older system heightens the\nurgency at which they must emerge. To be inside, we've seen, delivers the light-\nspeed benefits of time compression, of life on a nearly alive mesh. To be outside? It\nis to be cut off.\n\n168\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018400",
