Hi Jeffrey,

I got more votes than Jeb Bush got in Iowa, and I only had one congressional district, he had four!! It’s so
funny (to me — totally embarrassing to him)!!! Still like Trump and might be a delegate to the republican

convention.

Was in St. Thomas for a couple of days — did call this island, but never heard back. Went scuba diving off St.
Jeff and it was beautiful. Would be totally funny (to me at least) if you put a big fake shark or statute under the

water where the divers go....

Love ya,
