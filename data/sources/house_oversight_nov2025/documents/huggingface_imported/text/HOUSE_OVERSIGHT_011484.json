  "text": "Bibi is right about one thing. The negotiating challenges have become more\ndifficult since Arafat’s refusal of our offer at Camp David. Arafat is no longer\nalive. Palestinian politics have become ever more fragmented and messy, not\nleast as a result of the Hamas takeover of Gaza.\n\nBut Churchill once said that the difference between a pessimist and an\noptimist was that the pessimist always saw difficulties in every opportunity. The\noptimist saw opportunities in the difficulties.\n\nI, of all people, do not look at such opportunities without hard-headed\nanalysis, even a dose of scepticism. But the opportunities are undeniably there,\nand never has Israel risked paying a higher price for failing to see and at least to\ntry to act on them.\n\nThe first port of call should still be the Palestinians. I have repeatedly asked\nBibi, and the right-wing rivals that seem often to loom large in his political\ncalculations: “If you’re so sure you don’t have a negotiating partner in the\nPalestinians, who not at least try? Seriously. What do you have to lose?”\n\nBut beyond this, there is a whole range of relatively moderate countries —\nand, as Sunni states, strongly anti-Iranian countries — which share with Israel a\nreal, practical interest in putting in place a new political arrangement in the\nMiddle East. So does the United States, Russia, even China. Each, in their own\nways, is threatened by a terror threat that will require international action, and\nmany years, finally to defeat.\n\nA Saudi “peace plan’, for instance, has been on the table for years. Formally\nendorsed by the Arab League, it proposes a swap: Israeli withdrawal for full and\nfinal peace and Arab recognition. Successive Israeli governments have\ndismissed it out of hand, arguing that the withdrawal which the Saudi proposal\ndemanded — every inch of territory, back to the borders before the Six-Day War\n— would be not only politically unacceptable, but practically impossible.\n\nIn the final days of the Camp David summit, as our failure was becoming\ninescapably clear, a disheartened Bill Clinton said to me that he could\nunderstand, just about, why Yasir Arafat had not accepted the unprecedentedly\nfar-reaching proposals I had presented. But what he couldn’t grasp was how the\nPalestinian leader could say no even to accepting them as a basis for the hard,\nfurther work which we all knew a final peace agreement would entail. Wasn’t\nArafat capable of looking beyond the political risks, of understanding the\ngreater risks of inaction. Of seeing the rewards? Of looking ahead?\n\n13\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011484",
