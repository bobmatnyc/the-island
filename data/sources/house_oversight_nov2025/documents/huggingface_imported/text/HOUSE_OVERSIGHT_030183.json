To remove Hamas from the criminal law banning FTO support,\neither the secretary of state or Congress would have to revoke the\ndesignation of Hamas as an FTO -- a highly unlikely scenario.\nShould the Obama administration want to continue funding a Hamas-\naffiliated PA to maintain U.S. influence or otherwise promote U.S.\ninterests, current law gives him little leeway to do so. PATA places\nnumerous restrictions on any aid to a Hamas-affiliated PA, and any\nattempt by the White House to continue funding the PA in spite of\nPATA risks violating criminal statutes. Short of removing Hamas as a\ndesignated terrorist organization and FTO, the safest way to proceed\nwould be on the basis of legislative action that allows White House to\nsupport the PA even under a Fatah-Hamas coalition. Without it, the\nObama administration’s legal options are limited. No matter how\nmuch it may want to continue aiding the PA, then, its continued\nsupport may well be illegal.\n\nDOUGLAS N.
