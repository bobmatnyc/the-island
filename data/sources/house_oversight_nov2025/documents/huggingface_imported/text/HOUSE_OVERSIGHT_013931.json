  "text": "—CHARLES ATLAS, strongman who sold more than $30 million worth of “dynamic-tension”\nmuscle courses through comic books\n\nL, approaching large resellers or potential partners, small company size will be an obstacle. This\n\ndiscrimination is often as insurmountable as it is unfounded. Fortunately, a few simple steps can\ndramatically upgrade your budding Fortune 500 image and take your muse from coffee shop to\nboardroom in 45 minutes or less.\n\n1. Don’t be the CEO or founder.\n\nBeing the “CEO” or “Founder” screams start-up. Give yourself the mid-level title of “vice president”\n(VP), “director,” or something similar that can be added to depending on the occasion (Director of\nSales, Director of Business Development, etc.). For negotiation purposes as well, remember that it is\nbest not to appear to be the ultimate decision-maker.\n\n2. Put multiple e-mail and phone contacts on the website.\n\nPut various e-mail addresses on the “contact us” page for different departments, such as “human\nresources,” “sales,” “general inquiries,’ “wholesale distribution,’ “media/PR,” “investors,” “web\ncomments,” “order status,” and so on. In the beginning, these will all forward to your e-mail address.\nIn Phase III, most will forward to the appropriate outsourcers. Multiple toll-free numbers can be used\nin the same fashion.\n\noF ee 39 oe\n\n3. Set up an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) remote receptionist.\n\nIt is possible to sound like a blue chip for less than $30. In fewer than ten minutes on a site such as\nwww.angel.com, which boasts clients such as Reebok and Kellog’s, it is possible to set up an 800\nnumber that greets callers with a voice prompt such as, “Thank you for calling [business name].\nPlease say the name of the person or department you would like to reach or just hold on for a list of\noptions.”\n\nUpon speaking your name or selecting the appropriate department, the caller is forwarded to your\npreferred phone or the appropriate outsourcer—with on-hold music and all.\n\n4. Do not provide home addresses.\n\nDo not use your home address or you will get visitors. Prior to securing an end-to-end fulfillment\nhouse that can handle checks and money orders—if you decide to accept them—use a post office box\nbut leave out the “PO Box” and include the street address of the post office itself. Thus “PO Box 555,\nNowhere, US 11936” becomes “Suite 555, 1234 Downtown Ave., US 11936.”\n\nGo forth and project professionalism with a well-designed image. Perceived size does matter.\n\n=> COMFORT CHALLENGE\n\nRelax in Public (2 days)\n\nThis is the last Comfort Challenge, placed prior to the chapter that tackles the most uncomfortable\nturning point for most office dwellers: negotiating remote work agreements.
