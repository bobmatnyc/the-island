I am myself rather disappointed by the lack of skepticality of this community. As I said, I have read\nnumerous reports of orgies on Jeffrey’s island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies\nthat never happened. I am VERY skeptical of other claims on his behavior. I am defending Jeffrey for 2\nreasons: (1) Based on my knowledge and experience I am skeptical of the claims in the media and of those who\nhave settled claims for money... namely I don’t believe the published details just like I tend to be skeptical of\nmany published details on the internet.. I don’t believe Jeffrey did what has been claimed, and unless I see hard\nevidence, I will trust my own judgement here, and (2) Jeffrey went to prison, and I happen to believe that\nhaving served time, even those who questioned his behavior should be willing to give him the benefit of the\ndoubt, again until proved otherwise, that he is working hard to live a good life and do good things. I for one am\ndisgusted that people eat up the salacious nonsense they read on the web and then jump to conclusions about\nthings and people they do not know.. I do not jump to condemn people, especially when it concerns their sexual\npreferences. [DO NOT CONDONE sex with young girls, or young boys for that matter.. because there are real\nvictims there.. Until I know all the facts however, I do not jump to conclusions, and I am sorry, having seen the\nmedia frenzy around Jeffrey, and having seen the shoddy behavior of those who have attacked him, I remain\nskeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know.. If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.\"\n\nOn Apr 6, 2011, at 9:07 PM, Jeffrey Epstein wrote:\n\nso would i\n\nOn Thu, Apr 7, 2011 at 4:05 AM, Lawrence Krauss (EE wrote:\nps.
