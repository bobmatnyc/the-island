  "text": "February 13, 2013 -- If you want to know\nwhat an American president's foreign\npolicy is likely to be, particularly in a\nsecond term, don't listen to his State of the\nUnion speech. You'd probably have more\nluck playing with Tarot cards, or reading\ntea leaves or goat entrails. But not this year.\nBarack Obama's fourth such address left a\ntrail of foreign-policy cookie crumbs that\nlead directly to some pretty clear, if hardly\nsurprising or revolutionary, conclusions.\nHis first term contained no spectacular\nsuccesses (save killing Osama bin Laden),\nbut no spectacular failures either. And\nmore than likely, that's what the president\nwill settle for in a second, even as the Arab\nworld burns and rogues like Iran and North\nKorea brandish new weapons. He's nothing\nif not a cautious man.\n\nBehold: I am the Extricator in Chief\n\nAfghanistan -- the \"good war\" -- has been\npretty much MIA in Obama's speeches\nsince he became president. He's alternated\nbetween spending a few words on the\nmission there (2009) or a paragraph (2010,\n2011, 2012). If his words have been brief,\nthe message has been stunningly clear: It's\nabout the leaving. And tonight was no\nexception. Not more than two minutes in,\nthe president spoke about America's men\nand women coming home from\nAfghanistan.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025045",
