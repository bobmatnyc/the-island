  "text": "We got along excellently, had a lot in common, etc. Typical this-relationship-starts-well\nstuff. One evening, after we'd been out to eat in a big philosophical group, Mr. Ambition\nnoted the hotness of my intense theoretical bent. \"When you were discussing social\nJustice and ethics tonight,” he said, \"I wanted to reach across the table and grab you.”\n\nHe mentioned marriage within weeks. \"This has never happened before,\" he told me.\n\"I've never dated someone I thought I could actually marry.\" Whoa, tiger, I thought, but I\nhad to admit that he hit a lot of my Ideal Characteristics as well. Intelligence, drive,\ncharisma, and morality: it's hard to argue with that.\n\nOur sexual chemistry was okay, but not climb-the-walls stellar. We'll develop that, I told\nmyself. He's less sexually experienced than I am, and we'll learn each other just fine.\nFortunately he's got some experience with polyamory, but in terms of S&M, he's another\nof those vanilla-but-questioning guys (I never learn). When we did S&M, I had to\nmonitor the situation extra carefully because it was so new to him.\n\nAnd for all his intelligence, it was really hard to talk to him about emotions. It wasn't that\nhe was cold or distant; on the contrary, he's one of the most fiery people I've ever met.\nBut he had a lot of difficulty explaining what was going on in his head. Indeed, he told\nme that he had a lot of difficulty knowing what was going on in his head. He did things\nlike laugh when a friend hurt his feelings, then deny that he was hurt, even though I could\nplainly see the stricken look behind his eyes.\n\nI wasn't surprised that he was more physical than verbal about S&M. Very\nstraightforward: throwing me around, pulling my head back, digging his hands into my\nskin. He's incredibly strong, and sometimes I called my safeword simply because his\nstrength scared me.\n\nThere was one particular S&M encounter... early in the evening, I called my safeword\nbecause I wasn't sure he was into it.\n\n\"Red,\" I said, and he stopped. \"Is this okay with you?\" I asked, and he nodded.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"This is good. Let's keep going.\" His voice was low and slightly rough; a\nmarvel of certainty. He put his hands back on me instantly. My doubts disappeared.\n\nWe kept going. I watched my body, felt the lump building in my throat, monitored my\nbreath as it became harsh and fast.\n\n\"Red,” I said, and he stopped. \"You're going to break me,\" I said, \"I'm going to cry. If\nyou don't want to deal with that, then stop.”\n\nThis, by the way, is a difficult skill that I have learned: this ability to track my S&M\nreactions so clearly. I would never have been able to do it seven years ago, and I still can't\ndo it during complicated S&M encounters. But now I can do it during simple ones. (Yes,\n\"simple\" and \"complicated\" are in the eye of the beholder.)\n\nI really hate stopping an S&M encounter right when I'm on the verge of tears. It's worse\nthan an interrupted orgasm. But I'd rather do that than break down crying and then deal\nwith a horrified partner.\n\n\"That's fine,\" said Mr. Ambition. So we kept going. I cried. He started talking, and I was\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018620",
