In fact\ncurrent levels of ~$40 are close to the summer floor ($39) they had previously\nsuggested.\n\nBofAML strategists have turned bullish Oil & Gas equities given more CB (BoE)\neasing, attractive div yields and exposure to the EM recovery narrative. Moreover, Oil &\nGas has been the worst performing Stoxx 600 sector over the last 1M, suggesting it has\nample scope to rally if it is to catch up to the broader equity market (Chart 15).\n\nUSO (Oil ETF) puts are rich vs. SXEP (European Oil & Gas equity) calls: The number\nof long SXEP 25d calls that can be fully funded by selling 1 short USO 25d put is near\nhistorical highs (90\" percentile since ’08, Chart 16). In contrast, both SXEP and USO risk\nreversals are only modestly more attractive than their historical medians.\n\nSXEP calls would have offered better value than USO calls at current levels in terms\nof average historical payoffs as well as the frequency of positive returns (when sized for\n\nthe same upfront cost, Chart 17). Note that an unlevered implementation of the trade\nallows for early participation in any potential SXEP rally (as the SXEP call strike is near\nthe money) while providing a ~12% buffer before incurring losses (at expiry) on the\n\nshort USO leg (Chart 18).\n\nCSPP has purchased an outsized proportion of Energy corporate bonds and this has\nyet to feed through to equities according to our credit strategists (Chart 19): The\n\nnumber of Energy corporate bonds bought by the ECB is approx. 45% of the total\n\neligible amount — the 3“ highest proportion across all European sectors.\n\nPotential USO losses may be dampened if the recent $/Oil correlation persists:\nSince mid-2015 oil drawdowns have largely coincided with USD weakening (Chart 20).\n\nChart 15: SXEP (Oil & Gas equity) has been the worst performing Stoxx\n600 sector over the last IM\n\n20%\n15%\n10%\n\n5%\n\n1M Sector Performance\n\nSXXP return\n\n0% [ cient |\nae\n|\n\n5% 14\n\nSSESEESSSESESSSSS AGI\noO >< pul\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.
