  "text": "The third law states that any system simple enough to be understandable will not\nbe complicated enough to behave intelligently, while any system complicated enough to\nbehave intelligently will be too complicated to understand.\n\nThe Third Law offers comfort to those who believe that until we understand\nintelligence, we need not worry about superhuman intelligence arising among machines.\nBut there is a loophole in the Third Law. It is entirely possible to build something\nwithout understanding it. You don’t need to fully understand how a brain works in order\nto build one that works. This is a loophole that no amount of supervision over algorithms\nby programmers and their ethical advisors can ever close. Provably “good” AI is a myth.\nOur relationship with true AI will always be a matter of faith, not proof.\n\nWe worry too much about machine intelligence and not enough about self-\nreproduction, communication, and control. The next revolution in computing will be\nsignaled by the rise of analog systems over which digital programming no longer has\ncontrol. Nature’s response to those who believe they can build machines to control\neverything will be to allow them to build a machine that controls them instead.\n\n40\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016843",
