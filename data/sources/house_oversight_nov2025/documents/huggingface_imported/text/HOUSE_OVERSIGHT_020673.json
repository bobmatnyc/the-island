The boy’s father safely returned home in October 1945.\n\n#7 Childhood Friends\n\na\n\nOn April 6, 1972, workers of French company Joint Francais went on strike and were confronted by the riot police. This\npicture, captured by Jacques Gourmelen, shows two men — Guy Burmieux, a worker at the company, and Jean-Yvon\nAntignac, a riot policeman — standing face to face. In that moment, the two recognized eachother — they were childhood\nfriends. “I saw him [Guy Burmieux] go toward his friend and grab him by the collar. He wept with rage and told him, ‘Go\n\nahead and hit me while you're at it!’ The other one didn’t move a muscle,” recalled the photographer.\n\n#8 ‘Burst Of Joy’\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020673",
