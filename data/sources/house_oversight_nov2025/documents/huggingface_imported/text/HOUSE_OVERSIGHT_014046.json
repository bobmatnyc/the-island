  "text": "2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 67\n\nindependent standing to assert.** Congress viewed these provisions as\nestablishing a victim’s right “to participate in the process where the\ninformation that [victims] and their families can provide may be material\nand relevant... .”°°\n\nCongress appears to have had both intrinsic and instrumental reasons\nfor wanting crime victim participation. Congress clearly thought that such\nparticipation was valuable in its own night. Senator Kyl embodied this\nbelief and explained his decision to become involved in the crime victims’\nrights movement because of his discovery that victims:\n\nwere suffering through the trauma of the victimization and then being thrown into a\nsystem which they did not understand, which nobody was helping them with, and\nwhich literally prevented them from participation in any meaningful way. I came to\nrealize there were literally millions of people out there being denied these basic\nrights. ...\n\nBut Congress also thought crime victim participation in the criminal\njustice system could be instrumentally useful. For example, in protecting a\nvictim’s right to be heard by those determining a defendant’s sentence, a\nvictim might be able to provide important information that could alter that\nsentence. As a result, the sentence might reflect a fuller appreciation of the\ndanger posed by a defendant, and the judge might take appropriate steps to\nprevent others from being victimized.*’\n\nCongress also intended to ensure that crime victims were not\nrevictimized in the criminal justice process—that is, that they would not\nsuffer what scholars have called “secondary harm” in the process.** The\nconcem is that victims suffer when they are excluded from the criminal\njustice process. Congress sought to end that suffering by making victims\nmeaningful participants in criminal cases.*°\n\nC.
