The\ncase involved a joint venture real estate investment in the Luwan District of Shanghai, China, between a U.S.-based\nfinancial institution and a state-owned entity that functioned as the District’s real estate arm. The government entity\nconducted the transactions through two special purpose vehicles (\"SPVs”), with the second SPV purchasing a 12%\nstake in a real estate project.\n\nThe financial institution, through a robust compliance program, frequently trained its employees, imposed a\ncomprehensive payment-approval process designed to prevent bribery, and staffed a compliance department with\na direct reporting line to the board of directors. As appropriate given the industry, market, and size and structure of\nthe transactions, the financial institution (1) provided extensive FCPA training to the senior executive responsible for\nthe transactions and (2) conducted extensive due diligence on the transactions, the local government entity, and the\nSPVs. Due diligence on the entity included reviewing Chinese government records; speaking with sources familiar\nwith the Shanghai real estate market; checking the government entity's payment records and credit references;\nconducting an on-site visit and placing a pretextual telephone call to the entity’s offices; searching media sources;\nand conducting background checks on the entity's principals. The financial institution vetted the SPVs by obtaining\na letter with designated bank account information from a Chinese official associated with the government entity (the\n“Chinese Official”); using an international law firm to request and review 50 documents from the SPVs’ Canadian\nattorney; interviewing the attorney; and interviewing the SPVs’ management.\n\nNotwithstanding the financial institution’s robust compliance program and good faith enforcement of it, the\ncompany failed to learn that the Chinese Official personally owned nearly 50% of the second SPV (and therefore a\nnearly 6% stake in the joint venture) and that the SPV was used as a vehicle for corrupt payments. This failure was\ndue, in large part, to misrepresentations by the Chinese Official, the financial institution’s executive in charge of\nthe project, and the SPV’s attorney that the SPV was 100% owned and controlled by the government entity. DOJ\nand SEC declined to take enforcement action against the financial institution, and its executive pleaded guilty to\nconspiracy to violate the FCPA’s internal control provisions and also settled with SEC.\n\ncompliance program and commitment to ethical and law-\nful business practices and, where appropriate, whether it\nhas sought assurances from third parties, through certifica-\ntions and otherwise, of reciprocal commitments. These can\n\nbe meaningful ways to mitigate third-party risk.\n\nConfidential Reporting and Internal Investigation\nAn effective compliance program should include a\nmechanism for an organization’s employees and others to\nreport suspected or actual misconduct or violations of the\ncompany’s policies on a confidential basis and without fear of\nretaliation? Companies may employ, for example, anony-\nmous hotlines or ombudsmen. Moreover, once an allegation\n\nis made, companies should have in place an efficient, reliable,\n\nand properly funded process for investigating the allegation\nand documenting the company’s response, including any\ndisciplinary or remediation measures taken. Companies will\nwant to consider taking “lessons learned” from any reported\nviolations and the outcome of any resulting investigation to\nupdate their internal controls and compliance program and\n\nfocus future training on such issues, as appropriate.\n\nContinuous Improvement: Periodic Testing and\nReview\n\nFinally, a good compliance program should constantly\nevolve. A company’s business changes over time, as do the\nenvironments in which it operates, the nature of its custom-\n\ners, the laws that govern its actions, and the standards of its\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022563",
