  "text": "CHAPTER 11\n\nRestructuring the University\n\nIt is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.\n—Albert Einstein\n\nWhen I moved from Stanford to Yale, it was entirely because of the\nefforts of Bob Abelson, a psychology professor who became my good\nfriend and wonderful colleague during the 15 years I was at Yale. Bob\nhad been instrumental in helping to create the Computer Science\nDepartment at Yale, which is the department that wound up recruit-\ning me( Bob had hoped I would be outside the department structure\nsince I didn’t really fit in anywhere very well, but he couldn’t win that\nargument.)\n\nBob told me a story about the creation of the Computer Science\nDepartment at Yale, which involved his having to argue with another\nfaculty member on a university committee about why a department\nshould be created around a machine. He said that one member of the\ncommittee actually asked him whether there should be a department\nof lathe science as well.\n\nWe both found this to be pretty funny at the time. Now, however,\nI have to admit that the guy had a point.\n\nI have been a professor in quite a few academic departments in\nmy university career: linguistics, computer science, psychology, edu-\ncation, and electrical engineering. These departments all have some\nsomething in common: They have no real reason to exist. One would\nassume that departments represent academic disciplines that are co-\nherent in some way, but it simply isn’t so. The people in a computer\nscience department, for example, have in common that they all think\nabout computer-related issues, but so do people in other disciplines.\nSome parts of computer science have more in common with math-\nematics than they do with other parts of computer science. There were\nmany people in the departments that I was in who worked on things\nthat I didn’t understand or care about. All our interchanges were about\n\n157\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023903",
