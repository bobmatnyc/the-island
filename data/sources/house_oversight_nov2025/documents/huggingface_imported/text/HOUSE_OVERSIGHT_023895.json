  "text": "Defining Intelligence 149\n\nDoes the ability to do diagnosis serve as a hallmark of intelligence?\n\nCertainly doctors do diagnosis on a daily basis and doctors are\nhighly respected in our society. Most people think that if you are a\ndoctor, then you must be smart, but if you push on this belief, you\nfind that what people actually think is that a doctor had to go to\nschool for a really long time, learn of lot of complicated material, and\nthen work really hard as an intern and then as a resident. People re-\nspect doctors and may well think that the doctor is the smartest per-\nson in their small town, but that is typically because she is likely the\nmost educated person in that town. They easily may not consider her\nto have “common sense,” which is one way that ordinary people de-\nscribe their perception of intelligent behavior.\n\nDiagnosis is done by plumbers, detectives, engineers, and beau-\nty care professionals as well. Diagnosis is a very important cognitive\nprocess to learn. Learning to do it well often means the difference\nbetween success and failure on the job and personally. Can the inter-\nviewees do diagnosis? Miss South Carolina can.\n\nShe asserts that her friends can locate the United States on a map\nof the world. She can find contradictory evidence for the proposition\npresented to her, which is certainly part of diagnosis. The Palin inter-\nviewees have done diagnosis as well. They have determined what is\nwrong with the country. They may not have done much more than\nlisten to someone on talk radio, but they came to a conclusion based\non the evidence presented to them.\n\nBut they have done it badly. That is why they seem stupid.\n\nComing up with an accurate diagnosis requires intelligence. Ev-\neryone does diagnosis, but we seek counsel from those who do it bet-\nter than others. Diagnostic ability is a hallmark of intelligence.\n\nWhat about causation? Let’s consider Miss South Carolina’s revised\nremarks again:\n\n“Personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the United\nStates is on a map,” she said. “I don’t know anyone else who\ndoesn’t. If the statistics are correct, I believe there should be more\nemphasis on geography in our education so people will learn\nhow to read maps better.”\n\nMiss South Carolina thinks “there should be more emphasis on ge-\nography in our education so people will learn to read maps better.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023895",
