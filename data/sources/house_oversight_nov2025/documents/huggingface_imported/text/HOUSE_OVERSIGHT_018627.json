  "text": "I thought: Are you sure? and You definitely looked affected by it, but it's both unethical\nand unwise to question someone else's experience. So I just said, \"You know I don't want\nyou to do anything you don't want to do. Have you felt pressured by me?”\n\n\"No, of course not,” he said.\n\nWe talked some more. He ultimately said, \"Look, are you totally satisfied with the sex\nwe're having?”\n\n\"I mean...\" I said. \"It's not the most intense sex I've ever had, but it'll keep getting better.\"\n\"I think we should just be friends,” he said.\n\"_.. Okay,\" I said. \"Um. Is there anything else you want to talk about?”\n\nMr. Ambition seemed agitated. He seemed barely able to hold still. \"I've never dated\nanyone that I respected like I respect you,” he said. \"Your charisma, your intelligence,\nyour morality. But... I don't know. I don't feel like we're very authentic with each other. I\ndon't feel like there's much warmth between us.”\n\nMaybe you're right, | thought. But either way, it's too late now. \"Okay,\" I said. I thought\nfor a moment. \"I'm sorry,” I added. \"I really wanted this to work out.\" For a moment,\ntears startled my eyes, but I blinked them back.\n\n\"Are you all right?” he asked. He leaned forward. \"Is there anything I can do for you?”\n\nI looked at him and tried to think. I knew I was going to be very upset in maybe fifteen\nminutes. He seemed hurt, and I wanted to say something that would comfort him. I\nwondered if he wanted me to cry, and beg, and create drama; I wouldn't do that... but\nmaybe it would help if I asked for something simple.\n\nBut I couldn't come up with anything, and I wanted to leave. So after a pause, I said,\n\"You can let me go home and cry.\"\n\nI said it as gently as I could. But Mr. Ambition seemed terribly distressed. \"Ohhh,\" he\nsaid, and screwed up his face. He leapt to his feet. \"I'm sorry,\" he said.\n\n\"It's okay,\" I said. \"Is there anything else?”\n\n\"Sometimes I think men just aren't capable of the kind of commitment women are,\" Mr.\nAmbition said. He sounded defensive, even though I hadn't made any accusations. \"Then\nagain, you're not like most women.... You're kind of a hardass. You probably have this\nproblem with a lot of the men you date, where you come across as kind of a hardass....\nAnd to be honest, I don't think men really want to date women as smart as they are.\"\n\nJesus, I thought, you already broke up with me; can't you just let me go? Why do you\nhave to rip into me like this? | wondered how much of what he was saying was about me,\nand how much was him trying to make sense of his own feelings. But even though I felt\nsure that he was confused, his words sent an icy spike straight through me. \"J don't think\nmen really want to date women as smart as they are....\"\n\n\"I've worked really hard to become less argumentative,\" I said. \"You should have seen\nme when I was a teenager.... I don't know if I can tone myself down any more than I\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018627",
