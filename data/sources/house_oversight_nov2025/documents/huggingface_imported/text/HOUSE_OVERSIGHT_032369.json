Priebus choice suggests to me that he may go for a bigger name in \ntreasury than Mnuchin. Someone to underscore/push forward this notion that he is Reagan 2.0 (as \nsome are suggesting). I am just not sure who that person would be. The Trump trade certainly seems \nto have legs -- all the Hillary loving hedgies I am talking to are congratulating themselves for making \nso much money last week. They are all Trump lovers now! \nLandon Thomas, Jr. \nFinancial Reporter \nNew York Times \nhttp://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/landon jr thomas/index.h  \ntml \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032369",
