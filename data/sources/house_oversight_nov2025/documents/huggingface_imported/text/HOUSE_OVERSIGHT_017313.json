I doubted that the Arab League would\nagree to have me participate in such a team, but he assured me that he would try to obtain their\nconsent. That was the last I heard. I don’t know whether, in the end, I would have been willing\nto go to Cairo as part of such a defense team, but I certainly was tempted.\n\nI was less tempted by the offer made by Gaddafi’s Lybian lawyer. The Gaddafi offer was firm,\naccompanied by a signed formal retainer letter and contract. I have the contract in front of me as\nI write these words. It begins “In the Name of G-d, the most gracious, the most merciful. In G-d\nwe trust.” In the end, I couldn’t agree to what they wanted me to do, and the issue became moot\nwith the fall of the Gaddafi government and the assassination of Gaddafi. I was later asked\nwhether I would consider representing his son in the International Criminal Court, but that issue\ntoo became moot when the rebels decided to try him in Libya.\n\nMy final offer came from a deposed African head of state, accused of mass murder, who offered\nto pay me with gold bricks he had stolen from his country. Needless to say, I declined his offer,\nsince the gold was not his to give.\n\nOne American case I turned down grew out of a request from the author Norman Mailer that I\nrepresent Jack Henry Abbot. Mailer told me that he had urged the authorities to release Abbot,\nwho was serving time for murder, because he had become a great writer while in prison. Abbot\nhad written a memoir called “In The Belly of the Beast” that had become a best seller and had\nelicited excellent reviews. Mailer told me that he had succeeded in his efforts to have Abbot\nreleased, but that shortly after being set free, Abbot stabbed a waiter to death. Now he was\nfacing a murder charge, and if convicted he would never again experience freedom, regardless of\nhis writing skills.\n\nI agreed to visit Abbot on Rikers Island, where he was being held pending trial. I was allowed to\nmeet with him in a private lawyer’s conference room, with guards standing outside. We began to\ntalk and I became increasingly skeptical of the media story that Mailer had secured his release. I\nhad his prison record in front of me and as I perused it, the thought occurred to me that perhaps\nAbbot had earned his freedom by informing on other prisoners. I made the mistake of asking\nAbbot whether he was a “snitch.” Upon hearing that word, he leaped over the table and grabbed\nme around the neck. The guards quickly rescued me from his clutches. The last words he heard\nme say as I left the room were “No way I’m becoming your lawyer.”\n\n226\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017313",
