  "text": "TAX BULLETIN 2018-1: TAX REFORM SIGNED INTO LAW\n\nnext $100,000 of taxable income for married filing jointly ($50,000 for others). The following is a simple example\n\nfor a pass-through entity.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nH and W file a joint return on which they report taxable income of $200,000 (determined without regard\n\nto this provision). H has a sole proprietorship that is a qualified business and is a “specified service\nbusiness.” W is an employee and receives only W-2 wages from her job.\n\nH’s qualified business income is $150,000. 20 percent of the qualified business income is $30,000.\nBecause H and W’s taxable income is below the $315,000 threshold amount for a joint return, (i) the wage\n\nlimit does not apply to H’s qualified business, and (ii) the limitation applicable to specified service\n\nbusinesses does not apply. H’s deductible amount for qualified business income is $30,000.\n\nOn their joint return, H & W would qualify for a $30,000 deduction, reducing their taxable income from\n$200,000 to $170,000. That taxable income would then be subject to regular income rates.\n\nWhile upper-income wage earners in high-tax states generally do not fare well under the Act, taxpayers with\n\nsubstantial income from pass-through businesses should see a tax benefit compared with current law, since the\n\nweighted average rate of business income would be approximately 30%. Capital gains, dividends, and other\n\npreferential income from a business would not be considered “business income” and would continue to be taxed\n\nat preferential tax rates.\n\nUnder the initial Senate version, the pass-through deduction was not available to trusts or estates. Under the Act,\nhowever, trusts and estates can benefit from the pass-through deduction.\n\nCORPORATE INTERNATIONAL TAXES\n\n2017 Law\n\n2018 Law\n\nWorldwide with deferral available\nInternational Corporate\nTax — Scope\n\n100% of foreign-source portion of dividends\npaid by foreign corporation to U.S. corporate\nshareholder (that owns at least 10%) would\nbe exempt from U.S. taxation\n\nNo\n\nOne-Time Deemed\nRepatriation of Foreign\nEarnings\n\nU.S. shareholders owning at least 10% of a\nforeign corporation would be taxed on post-\n1986 net foreign earnings and profits (15.5%\non earnings and profits comprising cash or\ncash equivalents; 8% on remaining earnings\nand profits); may elect to pay tax over a\nperiod of up to 8 years, in annual installments\nthat allow more to be paid at the back end\n\nOTHER PROVISIONS\n\nThe Act has other provisions of note that are not included in the charts above.\n\ne Roth recharacterization no longer allowed. Under 2017 law, if you converted a traditional IRA to a\nRoth IRA, you could “recharacterize” that conversion within certain time limits, in effect undoing it.\n\nFor tax years beginning after 2017, the Act repeals this rule, meaning you can no longer recharacterize\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029443",
