  "text": "The “Americas Decades’ - The energy revolution\nkeeps moving forward, the implications are enormous\n\n- The NAFTA Bloc (US, Canada, Mexico) is emerging as a new “Super Bloc” for business,\nfinance and energy.\n\n- Combined, the NAFTA Bloc is comprised of more than 500 million people, a $19\ntrillion economy and the largest energy capability in the world. Not to mention US\nand Canadian military superiority and reach globally.\n\n- Mexican government “got it” and amended their constitution; Canada has “gotten it” for\nquite some time (i.e. oil sands, Keystone Pipeline, etc.). US Congress now seeing\nstrategic imperative (not to mention massive federal revenues).\n\n- The local, national, regional and broader geopolitical implications of greater\nhemispheric energy independence are extraordinary and are already creating significant\npolicy changes — and ruptures globally (i.e. Russia, Middle East, Venezuela, China, Iran).\n\n> Case in point: If the Ukrainian crisis has done anything, it has intensely focused Washington\n(and Mexico City and Ottawa) on the need to rapidly build out natural gas and crude oil\ndevelopment and export capabilities.\n\n> And, in the near future, can tariffs and fees on overseas sales help deal with the US deficit?\nThere are a growing number of members of Congress who think it can.
