  "text": "Sex Education For the Modern Catholic Child\n\nThis is a diaphragm. Women use it when they don’ t want to have a\n\nbaby. That is very immoral. Why, you ask? Because it is artificial, that’ s\nwhy. But never fear. There are other methods to prevent conception. They\nare very moral. Why, you ask? Because they are natural, that’ s why.\n\nThis is big brother’ s pajama bottoms. He had a nocturnal emission\nlast night. What a shame. It woke him up. But see the semen stain. It has\nmillions of dead sperms. They were killed the natural way.\n\nThis is his sister’ s sanitary napkin. It doesn’ t look very sanitary any\nmore, does it? There is an ovum somewhere in that bloody mess. But it will\nnever be fertilized. It will be flushed down the toilet bowl. That’ s the\nnatural way, too.\n\nThis is a baby. It was born dead. Every day in the U.S.A., 136,000\ninfants are stillborn or die within a month. Now suppose their Mommies\nand Daddies had interfered artificially with the process of procreation.\nGod’ s purpose would never have been achieved. Just think what a\ntragedy that would’ ve been. But at least some of the dead babies were\n\nbaptized. That’ s the natural way.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015048",
