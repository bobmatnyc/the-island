(Whitworth, who was arrested by the\nFBI in 1985, was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 365 years\nin prison. )\n\nThe Internet provided an almost ideal environment for false flags\nbecause its users commonly adopt aliases, screen names, and other\navatars. The threat officer explained how easy it would be for the\nKGB to adapt such a false flag when dealing with a dissident sys-\ntem administrator working for U.S. intelligence. As the threat officer\npointed out in his report, the KGB had used false flags in the late\n1980s to surreptitiously recruit members of the “German Hanover\nHackers,” a community of anarchistic hackers who breached com-\nputer networks for fun and profit. Until then, these hacktivists stole\ncorporate and private passwords, credit card information, and other\nprivileged documents as a form of freelance espionage. Because of\ntheir fervent anti-authority ideology, the KGB disguised its recruit-\ners as fellow hacktivists. The KGB succeeded in getting the Hanover\nhackers to steal log-in account identifications, source codes, and other\n\n© information from U.S. government computer networks, ®\n\nThe weak link of system administrators became increasingly rel-\nevant as the NSA moved further into the digital age. By the begin-\nning of this century, its growing networks of computers were largely\noperated by civilian technicians, including system administrators,\ninfrastructure analysts, and information technologists, who were\nneeded to keep the system running. Despite the warning by the\nthreat officer, the NSA became more and more reliant on these out-\nsiders as it reorganized to meet its new mandates for surveillance of\nthe Internet in the war on terrorism.\n\nThe NSA had to compete with technology companies, such as\nGoogle, Apple, and Facebook, for the services of experienced IT\nworkers. Though Booz Allen had been providing technically trained\nspecialists to the government since the 1940s and ’50s, congressio-\nnally imposed salary caps put the NSA at a disadvantage to private\nfirms in its recruitment efforts. As a result, it increasingly contracted\nwith private firms to find talent, especially in the rush for data-based\nintelligence following 9/11.
