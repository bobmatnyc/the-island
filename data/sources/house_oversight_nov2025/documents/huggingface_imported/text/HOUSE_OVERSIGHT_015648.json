Robert Maxwell's daughter\ninvited her to work as Epstein's personal masseuse soon after her 15th birthday\n\nWe kissed on the cheek and Ghislaine placed me on his other knee.’ Johanna spoke to The Mail on\nSunday three years ago about this incident, which took place when she was 21.\n\nShe said: ‘Ghislaine put the puppet’s hand on Virginia’s breast, then Andrew put his hand on my\nbreast. It was a great joke. Everybody laughed.’ After this, Virginia was paid, by Epstein, around\n$400 (£250).’\n\nShe met Andrew for the third and final time on Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little Saint James.\nVirginia was never under the British legal age of consent when she met Andrew. She was 17 during\nthe first two encounters and 18 at the third.\n\nBy now, however, Epstein, had started to hint\nthat she was getting ‘too old’ for him.\n\nBut during one trip to the island, Epstein and\nGhislaine made their most astonishing\nproposition, and one which repulsed her. ‘They\nsaid Jeffrey wanted me to have his child,’ she\nsays.\n\n‘They said | was part of their family and | was\nbeautiful,young, loyal and nurturing and would\nbe a great mother.\n\nThey said | would have to sign a contract\nrelinquishing rights to the child and consenting\nto Jeffrey having as many relationships as he\nliked. In return | would have my own mansion in\nPalm Beach and a large monthly payment, a\npercentage of his income.’\n\nThis, finally, was a wake-up call to Virginia and\nshe began to see the way in which she had\nbeen groomed.\n\n‘It was a smack in the face,’ she says. ‘I finally\nrealised this wasn’t ever going to be a real\nrelationship but | knew if | refused, I’d be thrown\nback on the streets. So | said, “I’m too young. |\nwant to get my massage credentials, then\n\noe\n\nmaybe we'll do it”.\n\nThe tycoon took her at her word and, for her\n19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to\nThailand where he enrolled her in a massage\ncourse.\n\nShortly after arriving there, she met an\nAustralian martial arts expert called Robert.\nThey fell in love and, just ten days later, married\n\nin a Buddhist ceremony. Conviction: Jeffrey Epstein\n\n‘lL called Jeffrey and told him I’d fallen madly in\n\nlove,’ Virginia says. ‘| was hoping he’d be\n\ndelighted. But he said, “Have a nice life,” and hung up on me.’ The couple now have two sons, aged\nfive and four, and a daughter who recently turned one.\n\n} comments on social\nmedia until she sees\nmean one... and admits\nmodelling career started\nbecause ‘I wanted to t\nprove them wrong’\n\n12.2. 2 be\n\nb Victoria Beckham\nshows off her svelte\nfigure in head to toe\nblack in NY... as David\nshares cute snap of\nHarper during daddy\ndaughter day in the UK\n\nb'You have to set\nboundaries': Khloe\nKardashian says\nworking out is a priority\nas she heads to the gym |\nin tight exercise gear\nShe's a gym junkie\n\n> 'Forever grateful’: Kim\nZolciak gets into the\nChristmas spirit as she\ntakes her six children to\nmeet Santa Claus\n\nThe 37-year-old shared\nsweet family photos\n\n> Emily Ratajkowski\nshows off her ample\nassets as she writhes\naround in sheer lingerie\nfor LOVE's festive\nadvent calendar\nBlurred Lines model\n\n> 'l had sex with two\nwomen’: The Affairstar ¥\nJoshua Jackson reveals 5\nawkward post-work\nconversations with\npartner Diane Kruger\nAll in a day's work\n\n> 'Mostly he says nein!\":\nClaire Danes reveals\nson Cyrus speaks\nGerman after attending\nKindergarten in Berlin\nwhile she filmed\nHomeland\n\n» Selena Gomez and\nNiall Horan continue to\nfuel romance rumors as\nthey're spotted enjoying\na date night at Santa\nMonica Pier\n\nLook away Justin Bieber\n\n> Prince Harry's ex\nCressida Bonas\nappears to go TOPLESS\nas she poses in velvet\ngloves and diamonds for\nhigh-end French fashion\nmagazine L'Officiel\n\n» He's really Gonna!\nBlake Shelton performs\nsingle about pursuing\nnew love in front of\ngirlfriend Gwen Stefani\non The Voice\n\nRomantic gesture\n\n> Christina Milian\nflashes her flat stomach\nin a glitzy crop top and\nskinny jeans as she\nparties with pal Vanessa\nSimmons\n\nDip It Low singer\n\nLindsay Lohan shows\noff her figure in sexy\nbikini and platform heels\nas she lies back ona\n\nhttp:/Awww.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361039/Prince-Andrew-girl- 17-sex-offender-friend-flew-Britain-meet-him.htm|\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015648\n\n6/29",
