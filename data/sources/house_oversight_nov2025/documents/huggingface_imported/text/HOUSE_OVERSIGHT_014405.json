  "text": "Risks: Geopolitics, diplomacy and US economic cycle\n\nThe biggest risk to our scenario is the implications for Japan’s diplomatic and\ngeopolitical environment of the Donald Trump presidency in the US. The likelihood of\nagreement on the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) has already declined and been priced\ninto the market, but any downward spiral in Japan-US relations would likely be further\nnegative for Japan equities near-term. A rise in protectionism would be negative for\nstocks with high US export exposure. Meanwhile if the US economy slows or enters\nrecession and the protectionist response weakens USD, it would be negative for\nJapanese cyclicals, particularly exporters, due to stronger JPY and potential trade\nconflicts. Moreover, a potential improvement in US-Russia (US-China) relations under\nthe new US President most likely implies a relative worsening in Japan-Russia (Japan-\nChina) relations. On the other hand, we expect Japan to move closer to Europe under\nsuch a scenario, raising the incentive to sign the Japan-EU EPA (Economic Partner\nAgreement), positive for related stocks. If the Trump presidency tips the US towards\nisolationism, we expect Japan’s spending on defense to increase. If this results in higher\nspending on Japan’s Self Defense Forces (rather than compensating for US spending on\nJapan-based US military), Japan’s defense-related stocks would be beneficiaries, and it\ncould reshape the arms industry in Japan.\n\nChart 1: Sector rotation and inventory cycle\n\n130.0 40\n125.0 4\n120.0\n\n115.0 20\n110.0 !
