  "text": "currently take three or four mini-retirements per year and know dozens who do the same. Sometimes\nthese sojourns take me around the world; oftentimes they take me around the cormer— Yosemite, Tahoe,\nCarmel—but to a different world psychologically, where meetings, e-mail, and phone calls don’t exist\nfor a set period of time.\n\nPurging the Demons: Emotional Freedom\n\nThis is the very perfection of a man, to find out his own im perfection.\n— SAINT AUGUSTINE (354 A.D-430 A.D.)\n\nTne freedom is much more than having enough income and time to do what you want. It is quite\n\npossible—actually the rule rather than the exception—to have financial and time freedom but still be\ncaught in the throes of the rat race. One cannot be free from the stresses of a speed- and size-obsessed\nculture until you are free from the materialistic addictions, time-famine mind-set, and comparative\nimpulses that created it in the first place.\n\nThis takes time. The effect is not cumulative, and no number of two-week (also called “too wea yall\n\nsightseeing trips can replace one good walkabout.4\n\nIn the experience of those I’ve interviewed, it takes two to three months just to unplug from obsolete\nroutines and become aware of just how much we distract ourselves with constant motion. Can you have\na two-hour dinner with Spanish friends without getting anxious? Can you get accustomed to a small town\n\nwhere all businesses take a siesta for two hours in the afternoon and then close at 4:00 P.M.? If not, you\nneed to ask, Why?\n\nLearn to slow down. Get lost intentionally. Observe how you judge both yourself and those around\nyou. Chances are that it’s been a while. Take at least two months to disincorporate old habits and\nrediscover yourself without the reminder of a looming return flight.\n\nThe Fimancial Realities: It Just Gets Better\n\nTre economic argument for mini-retirements is the icing on the cake. Four days in a decent hotel or a\n\nweek for two at a nice hostel costs the same as a month in a nice posh apartment. If you relocate, the\n\nexpenses abroad also begin to replace—often at much lower cost—bills you can then cancel stateside.\nHere are some actual monthly figures from recent travels.\n\nHighlights from both South America and Europe are shown side by side to prove that luxury is limited\nby your creativity and familiarity with the locale, not gross currency devaluation in third-world countries.\nIt will be obvious that I did not survive on bread and begging—I lived like a rock star—and both\nexperiences could be done for less than 50% of what I spent. My goal was enjoyment and not austere\nsurvival.\n\nAirfare\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013958",
