  "text": "do with words alone. One less something nearer zero, whether that something (the\nthrift index) is positive or negative, is nearer one. The wonderful books of Einstein\n(with Enfeld) and Steven Hawking, not to mention Mill, show that even calculus can\nbe put that way. My task has been to follow their tough act. But I will now start to\ninfiltrate notation where | think that that form of shorthand should help more then\n\nit hurts.\n\nSummary\n\nThe data for the free growth index of total capital @(Kt) in the charts and tables do\nnot represent a separate test. It is the same test adjusted to the three fourths rule.\nThat was proposed as a convenient rule of thumb. I would have shown a true\nseparate test if 1 knew how. Pure consumption might become separately measurable\nsome day, but human capital will not. The Phil and Bill parable shows that not even\nevidence from slave markets would be on point. Human capital has no possible\n\nvalue to any but its original owner.\n\nWhether in words or notation, I hope to make the point that Chapter 4 and the\ncharts and tables showing ¢(K)are likely to understate the case for Mill. Those\n\nshowing @(K,) should be nearer the truth. Physical capital and pure consumption\n\nare less than the whole. My three fourths rule will never be exact because reality\ncares little for the convenience of modelers. Proportions between the kinds of\n\nconsumption will not hold exactly constant and will never exactly agree. But I don’t\n\nthink the three fourths rule is so wrong that the real value of g(K,,) doesn’t run\n\nnearer one than the real value of @(K). (The infiltration begins.)\n\nThen the data support free growth theory convincingly enough if we trust equation\n(4.1), as do all macroeconomists as far as | know, and probably more convincingly\n\nwhen human capital is considered too.\n\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 14\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011033",
