  "text": "released from the US straitjacket and is free to resume its position as a\nregional power.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons, however, to dismiss the visit as just show. Mr\nAhmadinejad is a lame duck, banned by the constitution from running for\na third term in the June elections. As Iran moves into a period of war\neconomy under the pressure of sanctions designed to curb its nuclear\nprogramme, Mr Ahmadinejad is engaged in a furious struggle to ensure\nthat his rival, the parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, does not succeed\nhim. The corruption allegations levelled by Mr Ahmadinejad against the\nLarijani family are deeply damaging to the Iranian regime.\n\nMr Morsi, meanwhile, has little to show Egyptians that he has improved\ntheir lot. Cairo is the scene of near-constant street battles and the economy\nis tanking. Egypt's currency reserves have just sunk to $13.6 billion (Dh50\nbillion), below the critical level needed to cover three months of imports.\nThe country is staring bankruptcy in the face, but cannot access\nemergency funds from the International Monetary Fund without\nimplementing unpopular reforms that would further raise social tensions.\n\nBoth leaders need to show that they have \"friends\" abroad. The reality is a\nlittle different. Egypt and Iran appear to be divided by the Syria conflict,\nwhich is symptomatic of the wider split between the Sunni Muslim\npowers, led by Saudi Arabia, and Iran's faltering \"axis of resistance\" that,\nwith Syria in play and Hamas having defected, now looks increasingly like\na Shia Muslim axis.\n\nIf we look more closely, then the story of Egypt resuming its role as a\nregional power looks premature. At this stage, Egypt is trying to find some\nspace to manoeuvre between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Given that Saudi\nArabia has the money that Egypt needs, and Washington has a lock on the\nactions of the IMF, that space is limited.\n\nBut what does Washington think? Not very much at the moment. With\nPresident Barack Obama's second term team still being assembled, it is not\nsurprising that there is something of a vacuum in Middle East policy. But\nthe issue 1s deeper than that. The Obama administration has declared it\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027109",
