Conversely, the OTC has much less stringent\nrequirements; as a result, most publicly traded cannabis-related companies are traded on the OTC.\n\nIn Canada, cannabis-related companies are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the TSX\nVenture Exchange (TSXV), which is an affiliate of the TSX, and the Canadian Securities Exchange\n(CSE). The TSX is one of the world’s largest stock exchanges and, similar to Nasdaq and the NYSE,\nhas stringent listing, trading and corporate governance requirements. The TSXV focuses on companies\nwith small market capitalization and has less stringent listing requirements than the TSX. The CSE is\nfocused on micro capitalization and emerging growth companies, and it has the least stringent listing\nrequirements of the primary Canadian exchanges. In order to be listed on either the TSX or the TSXV,\na company is required to be in compliance with Canada’s Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes\nRegulations (ACMPR) and all applicable laws in jurisdictions within which it operates. (Operations\nof listed companies are restricted in jurisdictions, such as the United States, where cannabis is federally\nprohibited.) Unlike the TSX and TSXV, the CSE has allowed companies listed on its exchange to invest\nin, acquire and otherwise operate cannabis-related businesses in the United States.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the cannabis-related companies traded on U.S., Cana-\ndian and Australian stock markets. As stated previously, many cannabis-related companies are traded\non more than one market to attract additional investors and facilitate trading in multiple jurisdictions.\nFor example, most companies traded on the Canadian markets are also traded on the OTC.\n\nSummary of Publicly Traded Cannabis-Related Companies\n(As of November 30, 2017) Average ($U.S. millions)\n\nNumber of Market Enterprise LTM LTM\n\nCompanies Value Value Cash Debt Revenue EBITDA\nNasdaq 4  —$1,033.6 $884.5 $153.6 $4.5 $44.0 -$81.1\nNYSE 1 63.5 41.3 22.2 0.0 46 -1.2\nNYSE American Z 152.1 145.7 78 1.4 Us -6.5\nOTC 212 46.3 65.5 5.7 25.0 14.0 0.2\nUnited States 219 $65.5 $81.2 $8.5 $24.3 $14.5 -$1.4\nToronto Stock Exchange (TSX) 6 $1,361.5 $1,311.4 $71.0 $20.8 $26.6 $0.8\nTSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) 20 131.5 123.9 10.8 33 1.2 -3.5\nCanadian Securities Exchange (CSE) Af 12.6 72.0 2.0 1.4 1.8 -2.8\nCanada 67 $210.6 $203.3 $11.1 $3.8 $4.0 -$2.2\nAustralian Securities Exchange (ASX) 14 $85.3 $80.1 $5.9 $0.7 $0.9 -$2.1\nAustralia 14 $85.3 $80.1 $5.9 $07 $0.9 -$2.1\n\nSource: S&P Global Market Intelligence.
