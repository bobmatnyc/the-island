  "text": "Firstly, S&Mers and feminists both need to be aware of this emotional and biological\nphenomenon. It can create a sense of overwhelming intimacy with unexpected partners.\nAnd it can be used as a tool by abusers who groom relationships that started consensually\ninto abusive relationships.\n\nSecondly, we must keep talking about communication and boundary-setting. An\nimportant part of this discussion is openly discussing what happens when well-\nintentioned S&Mers screw up, and how we deal with that. Again, I wrote about that in\n\"What Happens After an S&M Encounter \"'Gone Wrong.\" Thomas MacAulay Millar has\na great post that lists the mistakes that can happen within S&M. He mentions, for\nexample, that sometimes there are genuine physical \"technical\" errors; sometimes people\nalso hit \"landmines\" or unexpected psychological problems (I also covered landmines in\nmy post).

Also, you should\ntotally buy the book. Okay, I'll stop advertising it now.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nFeminist S&M Lessons From the Seduction Community\n\nThere is an enormous subculture devoted to teaching men how to seduce women. Within\nthe last half-decade or so, these underground \"pickup artists” have burst into the popular\nconsciousness, aided by Neil Strauss's bestselling book The Game and VH1's hit reality\nshow The Pick-Up Artist.\n\nPickup artists -- also known as the \"seduction community\" -- exchange ideas in thousands\nof online fora, using extensive in-group jargon. One pickup artist site lists \"over 715\nterms, and counting.\" There are pickup artist meetups, clubs, and subculture celebrities\nall over the world.
