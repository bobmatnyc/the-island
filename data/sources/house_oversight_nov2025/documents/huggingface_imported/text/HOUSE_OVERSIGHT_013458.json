  "text": "~\n\nClassics Footnote from Israel and A\nSeparation from Iran. From the other\nside of the world both governments\nmonitored their directors as the Sony\nboys kept the peace.\n\nMichael and Tom Bernard invited me\nto the Independent Spirit Awards at the\nSanta Monica Pier. Michael hosted his\nTake Shelter nominees Jessica Chastain,\n\n64 | AVENUE MAGAZINE ¢ APRIL 2012\n\nOlivia Wilde\n\nMichael Shannon and director Jeff\nNichols. Tom held court at the next\ntable with the entire Iranian cast of A\nSeparation, which won. Tom almost had\na heart attack when I threw my arms\naround Iranian director Asghar Farhadi,\nwhich in Iran is unacceptable behavior,\nespecially by a Jewish American Princess.\nTom wished I had gone to the crowded\nchampagne brunch in honor of Prince\nAlbert and Princess Charlene at the Bel-\nAir Hotel where Montblanc launched\nGrace Kelly watches. Simultaneously,\nTV producer Gary Pudney hosted\nanother secretive, lunch which Albert\nand Charlene actually attended with\nGraydon Carter, Carolina Herrera,\nWallace Annenberg, Bobby Shriver,\nBobby Marx, Kathy and Ricky Hilton\nand Lynn Wyatt. Wolfgang Puck\njoined them for dessert.\n\n“The French, as the The\nArtist gang was nicknamed, had\nwon six Césars, France’s version\nof the Oscars, in Paris the night\nbefore. They flew all night and\n\n| Harvey’s chauffeur arranged a\n\n| police escort from LAX just in\ntime for them to win four Spirit\nAwards, cementing the Oscar\nwin.\n\nBack at the BHH, Spielberg\nwas the first to arrive at the\ntenth “Night Before”\nfundraiser in support of the\nMotion Picture and Television\nFund. Jeffrey Katzenberg had\nalready secured $200 of a $350\nmillion fundraising goal that\nincluded money from him,\n\nTom Cruise, Steve Bing,\nCasey Wasserman, Clooney\nand Spielberg. Every nominee\nshowed up.\nChanel and Charles Finch\ncooked up their chic soiree at\nMadeo, where a mariachi band\n\nannual\n\nenthusiastically announced\neveryones arrival. Bedecked\nexclusively in Chanel were Diane\n\nKruger, Elizabeth Olsen, Rose Byrne,\nGinnifer Goodwin and Rachel Bilson.\nAlso air kissing were Rachel Zoe,\nRosanna Arquette, Alice Evans and\nIoan Gruffudd, Zachary Quinto, Julia\nOrmond and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nMy Week With Marilyn’s English\ndirector Simon Curtis insisted we join\nKenneth Branagh at The Weinstein\n\nCompany’s bash at the Soho House in\ntime to hear Tony Bennett sing “Autumn\nLeaves” to Harvey’s surprised 86-year-\nold mother Miriam, Madonna and\nMeryl. Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo,\nMichel Hazanavicius and _ producer\nThomas Langmann staggered around\ncompletely jet lagged, too tired to speak\nEnglish. Uggie on the other hand was\nthe absolute star of the evening as his\ntrainer placed him in everyone's arms\nfor photos. WE’s Andrea Riseborough\nand Abbie Cornish sat next to baseball\ncap-clad Leonardo DiCaprio as his ex,\nBar Refaeli, kept her distance across\nthe room. Zoe Saldana walked in\nholding hands with Bradley Cooper.\nScarlett Johansson introduced me to\nher boyfriend Nate Naylor. Katy Perry,\nFelicity Jones and Malin Akerman\ncircled a refreshed Gerard Butler. The\ntwo daughters of New York slain hero cop\nPeter Figoski, Corrine, 14 and Caroline,\n16 who had also been Harvey’s guests at\nthe Super Bowl stood in the middle of\nthis circus and just fainted.\n\nSUNDAY, FEBRUARY 26\n\nI met interior designer Nicky Haslam\nin the Polo Lounge and found Nancy\nReagan brunching with Bob Colacello\nand Carolina Herrera. Nancy knows me\nas “The DVD Lady”. I promised to send\nher The Iron Lady. I didn’t have the heart\nto tell her that her late husband, who was\nMargaret Thatcher's best friend, was\nbarely mentioned in the film.\n\nIn a Marchesa gown, Dennis Basso\nfur and Iradj Moini necklace, I collected\nSimon Curtis and headed to the\nHollywood & Highland Center. Simon,\nwho has never been to the Oscars before,\nmiraculously scored a front row seat\nbetween Michelle Williams and Clooney.\nWe pulled up to screams of hysteria at the\nmother of all red carpets.\n\nMeryl’s publicist Dart\nwhispered to me. “She is dressed like\nan Oscar. What do we do if she loses?”\nSacha Baron Cohen hilariously guilted\nthe Academy into letting him wear his\ncostume from The Dictator and, after\nsoiling Ryan Seacrest, he went directly\nto dinner at Vanity Fair. Gwyneth\nPaltrow won the style award in Tom\nFord’s white column and Angelina Jolie\nso successfully invented a new one legged\npose in a thigh high slit gown on the red\ncarpet she repeated it for 39.3 million\n\nLeslee\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013458",
