Sunday/ Monday sanction rhetoric from ranging\nfrom g8 expulsion to Iran-style bank embargo is raised a notch. Russia follows with more threats of counter-\nsanctions. My sense is the Obama 5m of 696m SPR release is to show Merkel and co he will step in. He needs\nto because there are 8 small European and Baltic countries that rec 70%+ of their gas from Russia. Germany\ngets 30%.\n\nCross asset correlations outside of the US are increasing past few days - eg copper and the Turkish lira hourly\n\ncharts are on top of each other past 4 days. I'm worried there is a 30-40pct(?) chance of a hard risk off move in\nmarkets in first half of next week - more focused on European equities, copper, EM FX (Turkey, ZAR, Ruble\n\netc) than SPX. In that scenario oil is way up.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022272",
