  "text": "zone. Officials in the Colorado town imposed an 18-month moratorium on almost all\ndevelopment in its only census tract earmarked for the incentives.\n\nThe move highlights how local officials have the power to respond to criticisms of the\nlaw—in this case, that investors may rush to build projects the community doesn’t want.\nBoulder has long been a favorite spot for growing companies because people want to live\nthere, thanks to its college-town vibe and quick access to nature.\n\n“People think we have too much” development, said Bob Yates, a council member. “We’re\nnot Detroit.”\n\nAn eyebrow salon is surrounded by empty stores at Diagonal Plaza in Boulder.\nPhotographer: Rachel Woolf/Bloomberg\n\nThough Yates, a former telecom executive, opposed the moratorium and worries it will\nmake things difficult for businesses in the zone, he understands why people in Boulder, a\nliberal enclave, were skeptical of an idea enacted by a Republican Congress. He just wishes\nhis city would take a more measured approach.\n\nThe zone includes an aging mall called Diagonal Plaza. The tax incentives could have\nspurred investors to redevelop it to include affordable housing, which is sorely needed, he\nsaid.\n\n“Boulder’s teachers can’t live in Boulder,” he said. “It’s not a healthy thing to have\nsocioeconomic divide where lower-income people have to live outside of town to serve\nhigher-income people in town.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016418",
