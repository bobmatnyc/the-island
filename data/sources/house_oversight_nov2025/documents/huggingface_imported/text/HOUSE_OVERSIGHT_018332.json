  "text": "fuzzing, back-doors, or rootkits - and to develop new, more intricate ways to steal a\nmachine’s mind. This race for mastery is a sprint, one that heads ever deeper into\nthe depths of a vulnerable system. The closer you are to the very core of a computer\nprogram or a network, the more control you have. Real mastery of the heart of a\nsystem would be like having a spy win the Presidency, turning the whole US\ngovernment into a “Weird Machine”. That prize of immediate, high-level and totally\n“trusted” access remains the Warez Dude gold standard. 18\n\nThe most dangerous - and therefore the most alluringly valuable — of these sorts of\nattacks, are known as “zero-day” exploits. The danger they represent only becomes\napparent at some awful instant, “Day Zero”, when they are revealed to have been\nrunning wild inside some hapless network or machine. That first moment in the\nknowledge of the bug is like day zero in a cancer diagnosis, and it begins an\nimmediate race to find and deliver a cure. Such completely unknown, secret\nvulnerabilities are fissures in the walls of computers that their manufacturers,\nsystem engineers, and security experts usually don’t realize are there. The dream of\nhackers and spies and greedy Warez Dudes is a version of this trick called an\n“Advanced Persistent Threat” - hidden, back-door access to a machine that endures\neven for years, through upgrades and security checks and system cleanups, all the\nwhile forcing the now-weird computer to do things its user won’t even be aware of:\nSend a copy of every keystroke to another machine, for instance, or serve as a\nrobotic launching pad for attacks on other machines. All while acting like a perfectly\nnormal machine.\n\nThe best of the zero day exploits are based not on the idea of sneaking malicious\nsoftware onto machines so much as on taking existing, trusted code and finding tiny\nholes that can be blasted into giant, insecure data tunnels. These tools for\nmanipulation are digital opiates, in a sense, for connected nervous systems. Such\nattacks often rely on errors already knit into computer systems, or innocent\nseeming features that can be made dangerous. Every computer and software\ndesigner knows their systems are vulnerable. Mathematicians have proven you can\nnever be absolutely sure a connected machine is safe. A mobile phone, for instance,\ncontains nearly 30 million lines of code. The systems that run massive cloud\ncomputing basins like those at Google or Amazon are even larger, updated every\nday, and have to cope with unprecedented flows of data at very high speeds. Even\nexpert programmers will leave four or five errors in every million lines of code.139\n\n138 That prize: Sergey Bratus, Julian Bangert, Alexandar Gabrovsky, Anna Shubina,\nDaniel Bilar, and Michael E.

The\npiece is co-authored by and in honor of Len Sassman, one of the leading thinkers of\nthe Language Security or LangSec movement who died in 2011. Many of his talks,\nstill available online, reflect an unusually powerful mix of philosophical and\n\n100\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018332",
