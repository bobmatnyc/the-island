Around half of the 1.8 million people who had supported me stayed at\nhome.\n\nI conceded defeat after the first exit polls and said I would be stepping down as\nhead of the Labor Party. Still, since the election had been only for Prime Minister,\nLabor remained the largest party in the Knesset. Mathematically, Arik might be\nable to cobble together the required 61-seat majority with an assortment of smaller\nparties. But without Labor as ballast, his government would be even more\nprecarious than mine. When I triggered the election, he’d let it be known that if he\nwon, he hoped to include Labor in his government, with me as his Defense\nMinister. Even though I’d announced I was stepping aside, he phoned me the\nmorning after the election to make that argument again. He said Israel needed a\nstrong government, especially to confront the escalating violence. Having a person\nwith my background, whom he knew well and trusted, in the defense portfolio was\nimportant. I didn’t say yes. Unfortunately, I failed to do what I should have done: I\ndidn’t immediately say no.\n\nWhen the public learned about Sharon’s interest in a unity government, Labor\ndescended into bickering. Some of my former ministers, like Yossi Beilin and\nShlomo Ben-Ami, were against the idea of joining any Likud-led government.\nThey were especially disgusted by the prospect of doing so under Arik, the\narchitect of the 1982 Lebanon War. Most of the Labor’s central committee did\nseem in favor of joining. But given the scale of my election defeat, many wanted\ndo so without me. For a few days, Arik kept phoning me. I did feel that the\nsubstance of the arrangement he suggested made sense. But over that first week, I\nrealized that, understandably, he had little interest in addressing my policy\nconcerns. I decided to focus instead on ensuring a properly organized transition to\na new Labor party leader, and publicly confirmed that I would indeed be resigning.\n\nSeveral weeks after Arik formed his government — including Labor, with Simon\nPeres as one of four deputy prime ministers — he invited me to his office. He\nwanted to ask my views on a specific security question. That took barely 15\nminutes. But I raised another issue that I argued would have more far-reaching\nimplications. It was the idea of building the security fence along the West Bank.\nI’d tried to make the case for doing so during the election campaign, and I’d lost\nthe election. “Now I’m turning to you. When I left office, 39 Israelis had been\nkilled in the terror attacks. Now, there are 70. When the number reaches 700,\n\n391\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028239",
