  "text": "Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier’s allegations regarding Carter Page.\nOn Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: “In my communications with you and other\ntop officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive\ninformation about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the\n\nRussian government.”\n\nThat these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump’s victory, or that Mr. Comey’s ham-fisted\ninterventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton’s electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal\n\nsignificance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials.\n\nThe totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since\nan attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election “shocks the conscience,”\nany prosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The\npublic will learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire’s genesis.\nBut given what is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel’s activity\nbe paused. Those affected by Mr. Mueller’s investigation could litigate such an argument in court.\nOne would hope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General\n\nRod Rosenstein would do it first.\n\nMr. Rivkin and Ms. Foley practice appellate and constitutional law in Washington. He served at the\nJustice Department and the White House Counsel's Office during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush\n\nadministrations. She is a professor at Florida International University College of Law.\n\nAppeared in the June 23, 2018, print edition.\n\nBest,\n\nAndrew\n\nAndrew Grossman\n\nPartner\n\n<image001.png>\n\nWashington Square\n1050 Connecticut Ave, N.W. | Suite 1100\n\nWashington, DC 20036-5304\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026496",
