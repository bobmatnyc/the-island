Our\nnew Chief Japan Economist Izumi Devalier forecasts above-consensus Japan GDP growth\nand inflation in 2017, which is also supportive of our bullish equities scenario (see Ready\nfor ignition 18 November 2016). We expect rotation into cyclicals, banks and insurance\nas explained below.\n\n1) Upturn in inventory cycle: Defensives—Cyclicals\n\nWe expect cyclicals to outperform defensives, premised on our end-2017 $/¥ estimate\nof ¥120, and this is supported by our above-consensus economic growth outlook. Our\nJapan economist sees a shift to fiscal easing, firms countering the tight labor market by\nincreasing capex, and estimates industrial production to grow 3.5% and 3.6% in 2017\nand 2018, respectively. With the inventory cycle exiting a “contraction” phase and\nentering a “recovery” phase, conditions are likely to remain conducive to cyclicals\noutperforming defensives (Chart 1, Exhibit 3).\n\n2) Higher inflation, rates: Deflation stocks— Inflation stocks\nUp to 1H16, the Japan equity market saw continued preference for deflationary stocks\nas domestic inflation remained subdued and the JGB curve underwent excessive bull\nflattening. Defensives outperformed cyclicals (Chart 1), growth outperformed value\n(Chart 2), and stocks that benefit from a low-yield environment (REITs) outperformed\nthe converse (banks, insurance; Chart 3). However, we expect conditions to reverse into\n2017. We see US Treasury yields rising and Japanese core CPI inflation recovering to\n+1.4% yoy by 2018 and core-core to +1.1% yoy. Stronger inflation and higher foreign\nyields should steepen the JGB yield curve abovelQyr, while below 10yr should escape\nfrom downward pressure as Bo) rate cut expectations recede. Against this backdrop, we\nexpect to see a rotation from deflation to inflation stocks, which in addition to cyclicals\nmeans banks and insurance should outperform REITs within the financial sector (Chart 3).\nThis is also in line with the global rotation expected by Michael Hartnett (The Flow\nShow: The Inflation Era Begins 10 November 2016).\n\n3) Nikkei winner of steeper UST and strong macro\n\nIn a scenario of strong external demand and US rate hikes (particularly with curve\nsteepening), Japan equities tend to be the winner on a local currency basis, led by\ncyclicals, banks and insurance stocks (Exhibit 4). Resurgence in the “Japan macro trade”\nof short yen / buy equities is also a possibility.\n\nOur Buy-rated stocks in bank, insurance and cyclical sectors are listed in Table 1.\n\n>> Employed by a non-US affiliate of MLPF&S and is not registered/qualified as a research analyst under\nthe FINRA rules.\n\nRefer to \"Other Important Disclosures\" for information on certain BofA Merrill Lynch entities that take\nresponsibility for this report in particular jurisdictions.\n\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.
