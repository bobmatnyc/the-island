  "text": "Four security guards escorted me there. By the time Marc and | met again at the end of the\nthree prong red carpet, \"La La Land\" publicist and West Coast campaign queen Lisa Taback\nwas furious I’d told the shaken producer his film might lose. | said, \"Kelly Bush said that, not\nme.\" But | felt terrible.\n\nSure enough, the “La La” landslide never happened. It did win a spectacular six Oscars before\nWarren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked to center stage for the best picture finale.\n\n| was now standing against the wall at the first row of the first balcony. Lionsgate publicists\nJulie Fontaine and Jennifer Peterson, both dressed in haute couture gowns and borrowed\nemeralds, anxiously insisted | join their good luck group hug as best picture was announced.\nDespite my faux pas, and my work on most of the year’s top films, including “Moonlight,”\n“Manchester by the Sea” and “Hidden Figures,” Oscar night | was in the “La La” camp due to\nmy long friendship with it’s director Damien Chazelle.\n\nSo we three bejeweled broads were hugging tightly, wnen Faye broke Warren’s pregnant\npause and screamed \"La La Land\". The girls cried, the “La La” producers ran to the stage and\n| was thinking about how to apologize to Marc Platt as he thanked his family. Then, the stage\nfilled up with men in headsets. Producer Jordan Horowitz, the class act of the evening,\ngrabbed the right card and calmly announced \"Moonlight. No Joke.\" Platt, Horowitz and their\nco-producer Fred Berger handed their Oscars to Moonlight director Barry Jenkins, and\nproducers Jeremy Kleiner and Adele Romanski and left the stage as Mahershala Ali, the first\nMuslim actor to get the gold guy, joined the cast waving his historic Oscar.\n\nJulie and Jennifer ran to Soho House to oversee Lionsgate's victory party, where hundreds of\nconfused well-wishers waited to celebrate the “La La” wins, including Emma Stone’s best\nactress, Justin Hurwitz’s best score, and Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and Justin Hurwitz’s best\nsong for “City of Stars.” At 32, Damien Chazelle also made history as the youngest best\ndirector ever. Some, lacking any empathy for the winners and losers onstage, called this\nhistoric screw-up \"great live-television.” But standing in the balcony, alone and speechless, all |\ncould think was, “How did | miss this?”\n\n| ran to the Governor's Ball, which is the next stop for winners on their busy night. They get\ntheir statues engraved there before they drop by their studio’s party, get photographed, Oscar\nin hand at Vanity Fair’s fete, wall-to-wall with celebrities, and then head to Guy Oseary's home\nhigh in Beverly Hills to rock-and-roll ‘till dawn.\n\nAt the entrance to the Governor's Ball, Warren Beatty walked up to me, still holding the two\npriceless envelopes as proof of his innocence. | asked him, \"What happened?\"\n\nHis phone rang. It was so noisy, he bent toward me to hear better. The phone was almost in\nmy face and | heard Annette Benning asking where he was and saying, \"Warren, come home.\"\nWarren said, \"No. | have done nothing wrong.\"\n\nWarren's wonderful film, \"Rules Don't Apply\" received little Academy love, yet he was\ngenerous enough to show up. Now, fifty years after “Bonnie and Clyde,” he was in the Oscar\nspotlight again, the latest unwitting star of Oscar’s all-time blooper reel. As Jimmy Kimmel said,\n“We don’t have to watch reality shows anymore because we are living in one.”\n\nHere’s reality-show Oscar week as | lived it:\n\nTuesday, February 21st\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019850",
