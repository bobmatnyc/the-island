  "text": "Honorable Mark Filip\nMay 19, 2008\nPage 8\n\nprosecution is fair and appropriate has been placed, once again, in U.S. Attorney Acosta’s\nhands.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, we respectfully ask that you review this matter and discontinue\nall federal involvement so that the State can appropriately bring this matter to closure. We\nwould greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss these important issues.\nSuch a meeting would provide the Department with an opportunity to review the paramount\nissues of federalism and the appearance of selectivity that are generated by the unprecedented\nattempts to broaden the ambit of federal statutes to places that they have never before reached.\nWe sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nKenneth W.
