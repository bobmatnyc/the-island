This power law scaling led naturally to the suggestion that\nthe range of frequencies available in the electromagnetic signal from the calivarial\nsurface extends far beyond those currently appreciated and may be available for\nstudy using relatively noise free recording techniques such as_ the\nmagnetoelectroencephalogram (Mandell and Selz, 1991). A not surprising range of\nintrinsic correlation lengths reflected in Hurst > 0.5 and/or Levy exponents < 2 have\nbeen reported in lamb fetal breathing patterns (Szeto et al, 1992). The exponent\nhas been shown to be sensitive to maternal alcohol intake in humans (Akay and\nMulder, 1998), rat neonatal motoric activity (Selz et al, 1995), and nuchal atonia\nduration sequences (associated with putative intra-uterine REM sleep) in fetal\nsheep (Anderson et al, 1998).\n\nSequential amplitudes in 1 Hz stimulated soleus spinal cord H-reflex\n\ndemonstrated a $F 6B ~ 0.83 in control subjects and, reflecting the decrement in\n\ncorrelations, by 0.31 in patients with losses in supraspinal input from spinal cord\ninjury (Nozaki et al, 1996). Whereas the sequences of fixation times in eye\nmovements of normal control subjects reading difficult material demonstrated an\nexponentially decaying distribution, those of schizophrenic patients demonstrated a\npower law tail, consistent with more sequential correlations (Yokoyama et al, 1996).\nThis finding may be related to the appearance of velocity arrests, runs of sticky fixed\npoints, in a spatially oscillating target task, called “smooth pursuit eye movement\ndysfunction” in schizophrenic patients which has been modeled as a parametric\ndisorder in a periodically driven nonlinear dynamical system (Huberman, 1987). The\n“short time fractal dimension” has been used to discriminate acoustic signal\n\ntransformations from the speech of normal subjects and ataxic patients (Accardo\n\n214\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013714",
