It would be appropriate for Israel to pay some sort of compensation\nto the families of those who were killed during the raid.\n\n3. Israel should also issue a statement of regret over the incident.\n\nThe report's recommendations fail to meet Turkey's demands. Even\nbefore the report was issued the Israeli government acknowledged\nthat the use of force in the raid was excessive and unnecessary, albeit\nnot publicly, so on that point the report paraphrases something\nalready known. Payment to the families of the victims is also\nsomething Israel agreed to before the report. In respect to an official\napology, central to Turkey's demands, the report adopts an evasive\napproach and instead of recommending an apology, puts emphasis\nupon a statement of regret. Turkey has said before that this will not\nbe satisfactory.\n\nTherefore the report as a whole makes recommendations contrary to\nTurkey's demands and supports Israel's position. The statements in\nthe report that justify Israel's blockade of Gaza especially please\nIsrael. Sadly, Turkey's legal objections to the blockade no longer bear\nany political significance.\n\nAs expected, following the release of the report, Turkey has\ntoughened its stance with Israel.

Shortly after the leak,\nTurkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu announced a package of\nsanctions against Israel. Turkey first downgraded its diplomatic ties\nwith Israel, and the minister also declared that Turkey would take\nappropriate measures for safe navigation on the high seas in the\neastern Mediterranean. Military agreements between Turkey and\nIsrael have been suspended. Turkey will not recognize the Gaza\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024999",
