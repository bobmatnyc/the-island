Atleast one state, Arizona, has not begun that work. It will start testing in September, a late start that worries the\nexecutive director of the state’s marketplace.\n\n“It’s a concern that we’re testing this late,” said Tom Betlach, who runs the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System.\n\n“Usually when you do testing, you have to go ahead and address any changes. Given the October 1st start date, | don’t know\nmuch of it will be an iterative process.”\n\nBack to top\n\n80 House members: Shutdown better than Obamacare\nCharles Babington — Associated Press\n\nMore than one-third of House Republicans urged their leader Thursday to trigger a government shutdown rather than pay for\nthe implementation of the health-care law they call Obamacare.\n\nAletter from 80 Republicans asked Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to resist any spending bills that would accommodate the\nnew health-care law, which is nearing a critical stage of signing up millions of Americans for health coverage.\n\nBecause it’s virtually certain that President Obama and the Democrat-controlled Senate would reject such demands,\nleaders of both parties say the standoff likely would result in a partial shutdown of the federal government, similar to those\nthat occurred in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe letter is mixed news for Boehner and other GOP leaders who view a government shutdown as politically unwise.\n\nThe federal 2013 fiscal year ends Sept. 30. New money must be appropriated by then to avoid a shutdown of countless\ngovernment offices and agencies.\n\nVoters chiefly blamed congressional Republicans for the mid-1990s shutdowns, and the fallout boosted Democratic\nPresident Clinton. Ever since, many establishment Republicans have urged the party to avoid using shutdown threats as a\n\nbargaining tool.\n\nBut a new generation of tea-party-backed conservatives rejects the advice. They say “Obamacare” — officially the\nAffordable Care Act — is so unpopular and unworkable that it justifies extraordinary tactics to block it.\n\nA possible solution to the budget impasse, often used in past years, would involve a “continuing resolution” to keep funding\nthe government at current levels. Many top Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, say it’s\nimpossible to carve out money for Obamacare in any appropriations measure.\n\nThe House letter was authored by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. It urges Boehner “to affirmatively de-fund the\nimplementation and enforcement of Obamacare in any relevant appropriations bill,” including “any continuing\nappropriations bill.”\n\nAt least a dozen Senate Republicans have signed a similar letter.\n\nIn recent years, Democrats and Republicans in Congress repeatedly have failed to reach major compromises on spending.\n\nThe impasses led this year to automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, which have hampered\nsome federal agencies and helped shrink the deficit.\n\nBack to top\n\nBerkshire Hathaway — Full text articles\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019427",
