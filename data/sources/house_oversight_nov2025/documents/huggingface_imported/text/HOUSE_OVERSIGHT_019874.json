GENERAL KELLY\nEPILOGUE: BANNON AND TRUMP\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nINDEX\nAUTHOR’S NOTE\nThe reason to write this book could not be more obvious. With the inauguration of Donald\nTrump on January 20, 2017, the United States entered the eye of the most extraordinary\npolitical storm since at least Watergate. As the day approached, I set out to tell this story in\nas contemporaneous a fashion as possible, and to try to see life in the Trump White House\nthrough the eyes of the people closest to it.\nThis was originally conceived as an account of the Trump administration’s first\nhundred days, that most traditional marker of a presidency. But events barreled on without\nnatural pause for more than two hundred days, the curtain coming down on the first act of\nTrump’s presidency only with the appointment of retired general John Kelly as the chief of\nstaff in late July and the exit of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon three weeks later.\nThe events I’ve described in these pages are based on conversations that took place\nover a period of eighteen months with the president, with most members of his senior staff\n—some of whom talked to me dozens of times—and with many people who they in turn\nspoke to. The first interview occurred well before I could have imagined a Trump White\nHouse, much less a book about it, in late May 2016 at Trump’s home in Beverly Hills—\nthe then candidate polishing off a pint of Häagen-Dazs vanilla as he happily and idly\nopined about a range of topics while his aides, Hope Hicks, Corey Lewandowski, and\nJared Kushner, went in and out of the room. Conversations with members of the\ncampaign’s team continued through the Republican Convention in Cleveland, when it was\nstill hardly possible to conceive of Trump’s election. They moved on to Trump Tower with\na voluble Steve Bannon—before the election, when he still seemed like an entertaining\noddity, and later, after the election, when he seemed like a miracle worker.\nShortly after January 20, I took up something like a semipermanent seat on a couch in\nthe West Wing. Since then I have conducted more than two hundred interviews.\nWhile the Trump administration has made hostility to the press a virtual policy, it has\nalso been more open to the media than any White House in recent memory. In the\nbeginning, I sought a level of formal access to this White House, something of a fly-onthe-wall\nstatus. The president himself encouraged this idea. But, given the many fiefdoms\nin the Trump White House that came into open conflict from the first days of the\nadministration, there seemed no one person able to make this happen. Equally, there was\nno one to say “Go away.” Hence I became more a constant interloper than an invited guest\n—something quite close to an actual fly on the wall—having accepted no rules nor having\nmade any promises about what I might or might not write.\nMany of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict\nwith one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue. Those conflicts, and that\nlooseness with the truth, if not with reality itself, are an elemental thread of the book.\nSometimes I have let the players offer their versions, in turn allowing the reader to judge\nthem. In other instances I have, through a consistency in accounts and through sources I\nhave come to trust, settled on a version of events I believe to be true.\nSome of my sources spoke to me on so-called deep background, a convention of\ncontemporary political books that allows for a disembodied description of events provided\nby an unnamed witness to them. I have also relied on off-the-record interviews, allowing a\nsource to provide a direct quote with the understanding that it was not for attribution.\nOther sources spoke to me with the understanding that the material in the interviews\nwould not become public until the book came out. Finally, some sources spoke\nforthrightly on the record.\nAt the same time, it is worth noting some of the journalistic conundrums that I faced\nwhen dealing with the Trump administration, many of them the result of the White\nHouse’s absence of official procedures and the lack of experience of its principals. These\nchallenges have included dealing with off-the-record or deep-background material that\nwas later casually put on the record; sources who provided accounts in confidence and\nsubsequently shared them widely, as though liberated by their first utterances; a frequent\ninattention to setting any parameters on the use of a conversation; a source’s views being\nso well known and widely shared that it would be risible not to credit them; and the almost\nsamizdat sharing, or gobsmacked retelling, of otherwise private and deep-background\nconversations. And everywhere in this story is the president’s own constant, tireless, and\nuncontrolled voice, public and private, shared by others on a daily basis, sometimes\nvirtually as he utters it.\nFor whatever reason, almost everyone I contacted—senior members of the White\nHouse staff as well as dedicated observers of it—shared large amounts of time with me\nand went to great effort to help shed light on the unique nature of life inside the Trump\nWhite House. In the end, what I witnessed, and what this book is about, is a group of\npeople who have struggled, each in their own way, to come to terms with the meaning of\nworking for Donald Trump.\nI owe them an enormous debt.\nPROLOGUE:\nAILES AND BANNON\nT\nhe evening began at six-thirty, but Steve Bannon, suddenly among the world’s most\npowerful men and now less and less mindful of time constraints, was late.\nBannon had promised to come to this small dinner arranged by mutual friends in a\nGreenwich Village town house to see Roger Ailes, the former head of Fox News and the\nmost significant figure in right-wing media and Bannon’s sometime mentor. The next day,\nJanuary 4, 2017—little more than two weeks before the inauguration of his friend Donald\nTrump as the forty-fifth president—Ailes would be heading to Palm Beach, into a forced,\nbut he hoped temporary, retirement.\nSnow was threatening, and for a while the dinner appeared doubtful. The seventy-sixyear-old\nAiles, with a long history of leg and hip problems, was barely walking, and,\ncoming in to Manhattan with his wife Beth from their upstate home on the Hudson, was\nwary of slippery streets. But Ailes was eager to see Bannon. Bannon’s aide, Alexandra\nPreate, kept texting steady updates on Bannon’s progress extracting himself from Trump\nTower.\nAs the small group waited for Bannon, it was Ailes’s evening. Quite as dumbfounded\nby his old friend Donald Trump’s victory as most everyone else, Ailes provided the\ngathering with something of a mini-seminar on the randomness and absurdities of politics.\nBefore launching Fox News in 1996, Ailes had been, for thirty years, among the leading\npolitical operatives in the Republican Party. As surprised as he was by this election, he\ncould yet make a case for a straight line from Nixon to Trump. He just wasn’t sure, he\nsaid, that Trump himself, at various times a Republican, Independent, and Democrat,\ncould make the case. Still, he thought he knew Trump as well as anyone did and was eager\nto offer his help. He was also eager to get back into the right-wing media game, and he\nenergetically described some of the possibilities for coming up with the billion or so\ndollars he thought he would need for a new cable network.\nBoth men, Ailes and Bannon, fancied themselves particular students of history, both\nautodidacts partial to universal field theories. They saw this in a charismatic sense—they\nhad a personal relationship with history, as well as with Donald Trump.\nNow, however reluctantly, Ailes understood that, at least for the moment, he was\npassing the right-wing torch to Bannon. It was a torch that burned bright with ironies.\nAiles’s Fox News, with its $1.5 billion in annual profits, had dominated Republican\npolitics for two decades. Now Bannon’s Breitbart News, with its mere $1.5 million in\nannual profits, was claiming that role. For thirty years, Ailes—until recently the single\nmost powerful person in conservative politics—had humored and tolerated Donald Trump,\nbut in the end Bannon and Breitbart had elected him.\nSix months before, when a Trump victory still seemed out of the realm of the possible,\nAiles, accused of sexual harassment, was cashiered from Fox News in a move engineered\nby the liberal sons of conservative eighty-five-year-old Rupert Murdoch, the controlling\nshareholder of Fox News and the most powerful media owner of the age. Ailes’s downfall\nwas cause for much liberal celebration: the greatest conservative bugbear in modern\npolitics had been felled by the new social norm. Then Trump, hardly three months later,\naccused of vastly more louche and abusive behavior, was elected president.\n* * *\nAiles enjoyed many things about Trump: his salesmanship, his showmanship, his gossip.\nHe admired Trump’s sixth sense for the public marketplace—or at least the relentlessness\nand indefatigability of his ceaseless attempts to win it over. He liked Trump’s game. He\nliked Trump’s impact and his shamelessness. “He just keeps going,” Ailes had marveled to\na friend after the first debate with Hillary Clinton. “You hit Donald along the head, and he\nkeeps going. He doesn’t even know he’s been hit.”\nBut Ailes was convinced that Trump had no political beliefs or backbone. The fact that\nTrump had become the ultimate avatar of Fox’s angry common man was another sign that\nwe were living in an upside-down world. The joke was on somebody—and Ailes thought\nit might be on him.\nStill, Ailes had been observing politicians for decades, and in his long career he had\nwitnessed just about every type and style and oddity and confection and cravenness and\nmania. Operatives like himself—and now, like Bannon—worked with all kinds. It was the\nultimate symbiotic and codependent relationship. Politicians were front men in a complex\norganizational effort. Operatives knew the game, and so did most candidates and\nofficeholders. But Ailes was pretty sure Trump did not. Trump was undisciplined—he had\nno capacity for any game plan. He could not be a part of any organization, nor was he\nlikely to subscribe to any program or principle. In Ailes’s view, he was “a rebel without a\ncause.” He was simply “Donald”—as though nothing more need be said.\nIn early August, less than a month after Ailes had been ousted from Fox News, Trump\nasked his old friend to take over the management of his calamitous campaign. Ailes,\nknowing Trump’s disinclination to take advice, or even listen to it, turned him down. This\nwas the job Bannon took a week later.\nAfter Trump’s victory, Ailes seemed to balance regret that he had not seized the chance\nto run his friend’s campaign with incredulity that Trump’s offer had turned out to be the\nultimate opportunity. Trump’s rise to power, Ailes understood, was the improbable\ntriumph of many things that Ailes and Fox News represented. After all, Ailes was perhaps\nthe person most responsible for unleashing the angry-man currents of Trump’s victory: he\nhad invented the right-wing media that delighted in the Trump character.\nAiles, who was a member of the close circle of friends and advisers Trump frequently\ncalled, found himself hoping he would get more time with the new president once he and\nBeth moved to Palm Beach; he knew Trump planned to make regular trips to Mar-a-Lago,\ndown the road from Ailes’s new home. Still, though Ailes was well aware that in politics,\nwinning changes everything—the winner is the winner—he couldn’t quite get his head\naround the improbable and bizarre fact that his friend Donald Trump was now president of\nthe United States.\n* * *\nAt nine-thirty, three hours late, a good part of the dinner already eaten, Bannon finally\narrived. Wearing a disheveled blazer, his signature pairing of two shirts, and military\nfatigues, the unshaven, overweight sixty-three-year-old joined the other guests at the table\nand immediately took control of the conversation. Pushing a proffered glass of wine away\n—“I don’t drink”—he dived into a live commentary, an urgent download of information\nabout the world he was about to take over.\n“We’re going to flood the zone so we have every cabinet member for the next seven\ndays through their confirmation hearings,” he said of the business-and-military 1950s-type\ncabinet choices. “Tillerson is two days, Session is two days, Mattis is two days… .”\nBannon veered from “Mad Dog” Mattis—the retired four-star general whom Trump\nhad nominated as secretary of defense—to a long riff on torture, the surprising liberalism\nof generals, and the stupidity of the civilian-military bureaucracy. Then it was on to the\nlooming appointment of Michael Flynn—a favorite Trump general who’d been the\nopening act at many Trump rallies—as the National Security Advisor.\n“He’s fine. He’s not Jim Mattis and he’s not John Kelly … but he’s fine. He just needs\nthe right staff around him.” Still, Bannon averred: “When you take out all the never-\nTrump guys who signed all those letters and all the neocons who got us in all these wars\n… it’s not a deep bench.”\nBannon said he’d tried to push John Bolton, the famously hawkish diplomat, for the\njob as National Security Advisor. Bolton was an Ailes favorite, too.\n“He’s a bomb thrower,” said Ailes. “And a strange little fucker. But you need him.\nWho else is good on Israel? Flynn is a little nutty on Iran. Tillerson”—the secretary of\nstate designate—“just knows oil.”\n“Bolton’s mustache is a problem,” snorted Bannon. “Trump doesn’t think he looks the\npart. You know Bolton is an acquired taste.”\n“Well, rumors were that he got in trouble because he got in a fight in a hotel one night\nand chased some woman.”\n“If I told Trump that, he might have the job.”\n* * *\nBannon was curiously able to embrace Trump while at the same time suggesting he did\nnot take him entirely seriously. He had first met Trump, the on-again off-again presidential\ncandidate, in 2010; at a meeting in Trump Tower, Bannon had proposed to Trump that he\nspend half a million dollars backing Tea Party-style candidates as a way to further his\npresidential ambitions. Bannon left the meeting figuring that Trump would never cough up\nthat kind of dough. He just wasn’t a serious player. Between that first encounter and mid-\nAugust 2016, when he took over the Trump campaign, Bannon, beyond a few interviews\nhe had done with Trump for his Breitbart radio show, was pretty sure he hadn’t spent more\nthan ten minutes in one-on-one conversation with Trump.\nBut now Bannon’s Zeitgeist moment had arrived. Everywhere there was a sudden\nsense of global self-doubt. Brexit in the UK, waves of immigrants arriving on Europe’s\nangry shores, the disenfranchisement of the workingman, the specter of more financial\nmeltdown, Bernie Sanders and his liberal revanchism—everywhere was backlash. Even\nthe most dedicated exponents of globalism were hesitating. Bannon believed that great\nnumbers of people were suddenly receptive to a new message: the world needs borders—\nor the world should return to a time when it had borders. When America was great. Trump\nhad become the platform for that message.\nBy that January evening, Bannon had been immersed in Donald Trump’s world for\nalmost five months. And though he had accumulated a sizable catalogue of Trump’s\npeculiarities, and cause enough for possible alarm about the unpredictability of his boss\nand his views, that did not detract from Trump’s extraordinary, charismatic appeal to the\nright-wing, Tea Party, Internet meme base, and now, in victory, from the opportunity he\nwas giving Steve Bannon.\n* * *\n“Does he get it?” asked Ailes suddenly, pausing and looking intently at Bannon.\nHe meant did Trump get it. This seemed to be a question about the right-wing agenda:\nDid the playboy billionaire really get the workingman populist cause? But it was possibly\na point-blank question about the nature of power itself. Did Trump get where history had\nput him?\nBannon took a sip of water. “He gets it,” said Bannon, after hesitating for perhaps a\nbeat too long. “Or he gets what he gets.”\nWith a sideways look, Ailes continued to stare him down, as though waiting for\nBannon to show more of his cards.\n“Really,” Bannon said. “He’s on the program. It’s his program.” Pivoting from Trump\nhimself, Bannon plunged on with the Trump agenda. “Day one we’re moving the U.S.\nembassy to Jerusalem. Netanyahu’s all in. Sheldon”—Sheldon Adelson, the casino\nbillionaire, far-right Israel defender, and Trump supporter—“is all in. We know where\nwe’re heading on this.”\n“Does Donald know?” asked a skeptical Ailes.\nBannon smiled—as though almost with a wink—and continued:\n“Let Jordan take the West Bank, let Egypt take Gaza. Let them deal with it. Or sink\ntrying. The Saudis are on the brink, Egyptians are on the brink, all scared to death of\nPersia … Yemen, Sinai, Libya … this thing is bad… . That’s why Russia is so key… . Is\nRussia that bad? They’re bad guys. But the world is full of bad guys.”\nBannon offered all this with something like ebullience—a man remaking the world.\n“But it’s good to know the bad guys are the bad guys,” said Ailes, pushing Bannon.\n“Donald may not know.”\nThe real enemy, said an on-point Bannon, careful not to defend Trump too much or to\ndis him at all, was China. China was the first front in a new cold war. And it had all been\nmisunderstood in the Obama years—what we thought we understood we didn’t understand\nat all. That was the failure of American intelligence. “I think Comey is a third-rate guy. I\nthink Brennan is a second-rate guy,” Bannon said, dismissing the FBI director and the CIA\ndirector.\n“The White House right now is like Johnson’s White House in 1968. Susan Rice”—\nObama’s National Security Advisor—“is running the campaign against ISIS as a National\nSecurity Advisor. They’re picking the targets, she’s picking the drone strikes. I mean,\nthey’re running the war with just as much effectiveness as Johnson in sixty-eight. The\nPentagon is totally disengaged from the whole thing. Intel services are disengaged from\nthe whole thing. The media has let Obama off the hook. Take the ideology away from it,\nthis is complete amateur hour. I don’t know what Obama does. Nobody on Capitol Hill\nknows him, no business guys know him—what has he accomplished, what does he do?”\n“Where’s Donald on this?” asked Ailes, now with the clear implication that Bannon\nwas far out ahead of his benefactor.\n“He’s totally on board.”\n“Focused?”\n“He buys it.”\n“I wouldn’t give Donald too much to think about,” said an amused Ailes.\nBannon snorted. “Too much, too little—doesn’t necessarily change things.”\n* * *\n“What has he gotten himself into with the Russians?” pressed Ailes.\n“Mostly,” said Bannon, “he went to Russia and he thought he was going to meet Putin.\nBut Putin couldn’t give a shit about him. So he’s kept trying.”\n“He’s Donald,” said Ailes.\n“It’s a magnificent thing,” said Bannon, who had taken to regarding Trump as\nsomething like a natural wonder, beyond explanation.\nAgain, as though setting the issue of Trump aside—merely a large and peculiar\npresence to both be thankful for and to have to abide—Bannon, in the role he had\nconceived for himself, the auteur of the Trump presidency, charged forward:\n“China’s everything. Nothing else matters. We don’t get China right, we don’t get\nanything right. This whole thing is very simple. China is where Nazi Germany was in\n1929 to 1930. The Chinese, like the Germans, are the most rational people in the world,\nuntil they’re not. And they’re gonna flip like Germany in the thirties. You’re going to have\na hypernationalist state, and once that happens you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.”\n“Donald might not be Nixon in China,” said Ailes, deadpan, suggesting that for Trump\nto seize the mantle of global transformation might strain credulity.\nBannon smiled. “Bannon in China,” he said, with both remarkable grandiosity and wry\nself-deprecation.\n“How’s the kid?” asked Ailes, referring to Trump’s son-in-law and paramount political\nadviser, thirty-six-year-old Jared Kushner.\n“He’s my partner,” said Bannon, his tone suggesting that if he felt otherwise, he was\nnevertheless determined to stay on message.\n“Really?” said a dubious Ailes.\n“He’s on the team.”\n“He’s had lot of lunches with Rupert.”\n“In fact,” said Bannon, “I could use your help here.” Bannon then spent several\nminutes trying to recruit Ailes to help kneecap Murdoch. Ailes, since his ouster from Fox,\nhad become only more bitter towards Murdoch. Now Murdoch was frequently jawboning\nthe president-elect and encouraging him toward establishment moderation—all a strange\ninversion in the ever-stranger currents of American conservatism. Bannon wanted Ailes to\nsuggest to Trump, a man whose many neuroses included a horror of forgetfulness or\nsenility, that Murdoch might be losing it.\n“I’ll call him,” said Ailes. “But Trump would jump through hoops for Rupert. Like for\nPutin. Sucks up and shits down. I just worry about who’s jerking whose chain.”\nThe older right-wing media wizard and the younger (though not by all that much)\ncontinued on to the other guests’ satisfaction until twelve-thirty, the older trying to see\nthrough to the new national enigma that was Trump—although Ailes would say that in\nfact Trump’s behavior was ever predictable—and the younger seemingly determined not\nto spoil his own moment of destiny.\n“Donald Trump has got it. He’s Trump, but he’s got it. Trump is Trump,” affirmed\nBannon.\n“Yeah, he’s Trump,” said Ailes, with something like incredulity.\n1\nELECTION DAY\nO\nn the afternoon of November 8, 2016, Kellyanne Conway—Donald Trump’s\ncampaign manager and a central, indeed starring, personality of Trumpworld—\nsettled into her glass office at Trump Tower. Right up until the last weeks of the race, the\nTrump campaign headquarters had remained a listless place. All that seemed to distinguish\nit from a corporate back office were a few posters with right-wing slogans.\nConway now was in a remarkably buoyant mood considering she was about to\nexperience a resounding if not cataclysmic defeat. Donald Trump would lose the election\n—of this she was sure—but he would quite possibly hold the defeat to under 6 points.\nThat was a substantial victory. As for the looming defeat itself, she shrugged it off: it was\nReince Priebus’s fault, not hers.\nShe had spent a good part of the day calling friends and allies in the political world and\nblaming Priebus. Now she briefed some of the television producers and anchors with\nwhom she’d built strong relationships—and with whom, actively interviewing in the last\nfew weeks, she was hoping to land a permanent on-air job after the election. She’d\ncarefully courted many of them since joining the Trump campaign in mid-August and\nbecoming the campaign’s reliably combative voice and, with her spasmodic smiles and\nstrange combination of woundedness and imperturbability, peculiarly telegenic face.\nBeyond all of the other horrible blunders of the campaign, the real problem, she said,\nwas the devil they couldn’t control: the Republican National Committee, which was run\nby Priebus, his sidekick, thirty-two-year-old Katie Walsh, and their flack, Sean Spicer.\nInstead of being all in, the RNC, ultimately the tool of the Republican establishment, had\nbeen hedging its bets ever since Trump won the nomination in early summer. When\nTrump needed the push, the push just wasn’t there.\nThat was the first part of Conway’s spin. The other part was that despite everything,\nthe campaign had really clawed its way back from the abyss. A severely underresourced\nteam with, practically speaking, the worst candidate in modern political history—Conway\noffered either an eye-rolling pantomime whenever Trump’s name was mentioned, or a\ndead stare—had actually done extraordinarily well. Conway, who had never been involved\nin a national campaign, and who, before Trump, ran a small-time, down-ballot polling\nfirm, understood full well that, post-campaign, she would now be one of the leading\nconservative voices on cable news.\nIn fact, one of the Trump campaign pollsters, John McLaughlin, had begun to suggest\nwithin the past week or so that some key state numbers, heretofore dismal, might actually\nbe changing to Trump’s advantage. But neither Conway nor Trump himself nor his son-inlaw\nJared Kushner—the effective head of the campaign, or the designated family monitor\nof it—wavered in their certainty: their unexpected adventure would soon be over.\nOnly Steve Bannon, in his odd-man view, insisted the numbers would break in their\nfavor. But this being Bannon’s view—crazy Steve—it was quite the opposite of being a\nreassuring one.\nAlmost everybody in the campaign, still an extremely small outfit, thought of\nthemselves as a clear-eyed team, as realistic about their prospects as perhaps any in\npolitics. The unspoken agreement among them: not only would Donald Trump not be\npresident, he should probably not be. Conveniently, the former conviction meant nobody\nhad to deal with the latter issue.\nAs the campaign came to an end, Trump himself was sanguine. He had survived the\nrelease of the Billy Bush tape when, in the uproar that followed, the RNC had had the gall\nto pressure him to quit the race. FBI director James Comey, having bizarrely hung Hillary\nout to dry by saying he was reopening the investigation into her emails eleven days before\nthe election, had helped avert a total Clinton landslide.\n“I can be the most famous man in the world,” Trump told his on-again, off-again aide\nSam Nunberg at the outset of the campaign.\n“But do you want to be president?” Nunberg asked (a qualitatively different question\nthan the usual existential candidate test: “Why do you want to be president?”). Nunberg\ndid not get an answer.\nThe point was, there didn’t need to be an answer because he wasn’t going to be\npresident.\nTrump’s longtime friend Roger Ailes liked to say that if you wanted a career in\ntelevision, first run for president. Now Trump, encouraged by Ailes, was floating rumors\nabout a Trump network. It was a great future.\nHe would come out of this campaign, Trump assured Ailes, with a far more powerful\nbrand and untold opportunities. “This is bigger than I ever dreamed of,” he told Ailes in a\nconversation a week before the election. “I don’t think about losing because it isn’t losing.\nWe’ve totally won.” What’s more, he was already laying down his public response to\nlosing the election: It was stolen!\nDonald Trump and his tiny band of campaign warriors were ready to lose with fire and\nfury. They were not ready to win.\n* * *\nIn politics somebody has to lose, but invariably everybody thinks they can win. And you\nprobably can’t win unless you believe that you will win—except in the Trump campaign.\nThe leitmotif for Trump about his own campaign was how crappy it was and how\neverybody involved in it was a loser. He was equally convinced that the Clinton people\nwere brilliant winners—“They’ve got the best and we’ve got the worst,” he frequently\nsaid. Time spent with Trump on the campaign plane was often an epic dissing experience:\neverybody around him was an idiot.\nCorey Lewandowski, who served as Trump’s first more or less official campaign\nmanager, was often berated by the candidate. For months Trump called him “the worst,”\nand in June 2016 he was finally fired. Ever after, Trump proclaimed his campaign doomed\nwithout Lewandowski. “We’re all losers,” he would say. “All our guys are terrible, nobody\nknows what they’re doing… . Wish Corey was back.” Trump quickly soured on his\nsecond campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well.\nBy August, trailing Clinton by 12 to 17 points and facing a daily firestorm of\neviscerating press, Trump couldn’t conjure even a far-fetched scenario for achieving an\nelectoral victory. At this dire moment, Trump in some essential sense sold his losing\ncampaign. The right-wing billionaire Bob Mercer, a Ted Cruz backer, had shifted his\nsupport to Trump with a $5 million infusion. Believing the campaign was cratering,\nMercer and his daughter Rebekah took a helicopter from their Long Island estate out to a\nscheduled fundraiser—with other potential donors bailing by the second—at New York\nJets owner and Johnson & Johnson heir Woody Johnson’s summer house in the Hamptons.\nTrump had no real relationship with either father or daughter. He’d had only a few\nconversations with Bob Mercer, who mostly talked in monosyllables; Rebekah Mercer’s\nentire history with Trump consisted of a selfie taken with him at Trump Tower. But when\nthe Mercers presented their plan to take over the campaign and install their lieutenants,\nSteve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, Trump didn’t resist. He only expressed vast\nincomprehension about why anyone would want to do that. “This thing,” he told the\nMercers, “is so fucked up.”\nBy every meaningful indicator, something greater than even a sense of doom shadowed\nwhat Steve Bannon called “the broke-dick campaign”—a sense of structural impossibility.\nThe candidate who billed himself as a billionaire—ten times over—refused even to\ninvest his own money in it. Bannon told Jared Kushner—who, when Bannon signed on to\nthe campaign, had been off with his wife on a holiday in Croatia with Trump enemy David\nGeffen—that, after the first debate in September, they would need an additional $50\nmillion to cover them until election day.\n“No way we’ll get fifty million unless we can guarantee him victory,” said a clear-eyed\nKushner.\n“Twenty-five million?” prodded Bannon.\n“If we can say victory is more than likely.”\nIn the end, the best Trump would do is loan the campaign $10 million, provided he got\nit back as soon as they could raise other money. (Steve Mnuchin, then the campaign’s\nfinance chairman, came to collect the loan with the wire instructions ready to go, so\nTrump couldn’t conveniently forget to send the money.)\nThere was in fact no real campaign because there was no real organization, or at best\nonly a uniquely dysfunctional one. Roger Stone, the early de facto campaign manager, quit\nor was fired by Trump—with each man publicly claiming he had slapped down the other.\nSam Nunberg, a Trump aide who had worked for Stone, was noisily ousted by\nLewandowski, and then Trump exponentially increased the public dirty-clothes-washing\nby suing Nunberg. Lewandowski and Hope Hicks, the PR aide put on the campaign by\nIvanka Trump, had an affair that ended in a public fight on the street—an incident cited by\nNunberg in his response to Trump’s suit. The campaign, on its face, was not designed to\nwin anything.\nEven as Trump eliminated the sixteen other Republican candidates, however farfetched\nthat might have seemed, it did not make the ultimate goal of winning the\npresidency any less preposterous.\nAnd if, during the fall, winning seemed slightly more plausible, that evaporated with\nthe Billy Bush affair. “I’m automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them,”\nTrump told the NBC host Billy Bush on an open mic, amid the ongoing national debate\nabout sexual harassment. “It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re\na star they let you do it. You can do anything… . Grab them by the pussy. You can do\nanything.”\nIt was an operatic unraveling. So mortifying was this development that when Reince\nPriebus, the RNC head, was called to New York from Washington for an emergency\nmeeting at Trump Tower, he couldn’t bring himself to leave Penn Station. It took two\nhours for the Trump team to coax him across town.\n“Bro,” said a desperate Bannon, cajoling Priebus on the phone, “I may never see you\nagain after today, but you gotta come to this building and you gotta walk through the front\ndoor.”\n* * *\nThe silver lining of the ignominy Melania Trump had to endure after the Billy Bush tape\nwas that now there was no way her husband could become president.\nDonald Trump’s marriage was perplexing to almost everybody around him—or it was,\nanyway, for those without private jets and many homes. He and Melania spent relatively\nlittle time together. They could go days at a time without contact, even when they were\nboth in Trump Tower. Often she did not know where he was, or take much notice of that\nfact. Her husband moved between residences as he would move between rooms. Along\nwith knowing little about his whereabouts, she knew little about his business, and took at\nbest modest interest in it. An absentee father for his first four children, Trump was even\nmore absent for his fifth, Barron, his son with Melania. Now on his third marriage, he told\nfriends he thought he had finally perfected the art: live and let live—“Do your own thing.”\nHe was a notorious womanizer, and during the campaign became possibly the world’s\nmost famous masher. While nobody would ever say Trump was sensitive when it came to\nwomen, he had many views about how to get along with them, including a theory he\ndiscussed with friends about how the more years between an older man and a younger\nwoman, the less the younger woman took an older man’s cheating personally.\nStill, the notion that this was a marriage in name only was far from true. He spoke of\nMelania frequently when she wasn’t there. He admired her looks—often, awkwardly for\nher, in the presence of others. She was, he told people proudly and without irony, a\n“trophy wife.” And while he may not have quite shared his life with her, he gladly shared\nthe spoils of it. “A happy wife is a happy life,” he said, echoing a popular rich-man truism.\nHe also sought Melania’s approval. (He sought the approval of all the women around\nhim, who were wise to give it.) In 2014, when he first seriously began to consider running\nfor president, Melania was one of the few who thought it was possible he could win. It\nwas a punch line for his daughter, Ivanka, who had carefully distanced herself from the\ncampaign. With a never-too-hidden distaste for her stepmother, Ivanka would say to\nfriends: All you have to know about Melania is that she thinks if he runs he’ll certainly\nwin.\nBut the prospect of her husband’s actually becoming president was, for Melania, a\nhorrifying one. She believed it would destroy her carefully sheltered life—one sheltered,\nnot inconsiderably, from the extended Trump family—which was almost entirely focused\non her young son.\nDon’t put the cart before the horse, her amused husband said, even as he spent every\nday on the campaign trail, dominating the news. But her terror and torment mounted.\nThere was a whisper campaign about her, cruel and comical in its insinuations, going\non in Manhattan, which friends told her about. Her modeling career was under close\nscrutiny. In Slovenia, where she grew up, a celebrity magazine, Suzy, put the rumors about\nher into print after Trump got the nomination. Then, with a sickening taste of what might\nbe ahead, the Daily Mail blew the story across the world.\nThe New York Post got its hands on outtakes from a nude photo shoot that Melania had\ndone early in her modeling career—a leak that everybody other than Melania assumed\ncould be traced back to Trump himself.\nInconsolable, she confronted her husband. Is this the future? She told him she wouldn’t\nbe able to take it.\nTrump responded in his fashion—We’ll sue!—and set her up with lawyers who\nsuccessfully did just that. But he was unaccustomedly contrite, too. Just a little longer, he\ntold her. It would all be over in November. He offered his wife a solemn guarantee: there\nwas simply no way he would win. And even for a chronically—he would say helplessly—\nunfaithful husband, this was one promise to his wife that he seemed sure to keep.\n* * *\nThe Trump campaign had, perhaps less than inadvertently, replicated the scheme from Mel\nBrooks’s The Producers. In that classic, Brooks’s larcenous and dopey heroes, Max\nBialystock and Leo Bloom, set out to sell more than 100 percent of the ownership stakes\nin the Broadway show they are producing. Since they will be found out only if the show is\na hit, everything about the show is premised on its being a flop. Accordingly, they create a\nshow so outlandish that it actually succeeds, thus dooming our heroes.\nWinning presidential candidates—driven by hubris or narcissism or a preternatural\nsense of destiny—have, more than likely, spent a substantial part of their careers, if not\ntheir lives from adolescence, preparing for the role. They rise up the ladder of elected\noffices. They perfect a public face. They manically network, since success in politics is\nlargely about who your allies are. They cram. (Even in the case of an uninterested George\nW. Bush, he relied on his father’s cronies to cram for him.) And they clean up after\nthemselves—or, at least, take great care to cover up. They prepare themselves to win and\nto govern.\nThe Trump calculation, quite a conscious one, was different. The candidate and his top\nlieutenants believed they could get all the benefits of almost becoming president without\nhaving to change their behavior or their fundamental worldview one whit: we don’t have\nto be anything but who and what we are, because of course we won’t win.\nMany candidates for president have made a virtue of being Washington outsiders; in\npractice, this strategy merely favors governors over senators. Every serious candidate, no\nmatter how much he or she disses Washington, relies on Beltway insiders for counsel and\nsupport. But with Trump, hardly a person in his innermost circle had ever worked in\npolitics at the national level—his closest advisers had not worked in politics at all.\nThroughout his life, Trump had few close friends of any kind, but when he began his\ncampaign for president he had almost no friends in politics. The only two actual\npoliticians with whom Trump was close were Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie, and both\nmen were in their own way peculiar and isolated. And to say that he knew nothing—\nnothing at all—about the basic intellectual foundations of the job was a comic\nunderstatement. Early in the campaign, in a Producers-worthy scene, Sam Nunberg was\nsent to explain the Constitution to the candidate: “I got as far as the Fourth Amendment\nbefore his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head.”\nAlmost everybody on the Trump team came with the kind of messy conflicts bound to\nbite a president or his staff. Mike Flynn, Trump’s future National Security Advisor, who\nbecame Trump’s opening act at campaign rallies and whom Trump loved to hear complain\nabout the CIA and the haplessness of American spies, had been told by his friends that it\nhad not been a good idea to take $45,000 from the Russians for a speech. “Well, it would\nonly be a problem if we won,” he assured them, knowing that it would therefore not be a\nproblem.\nPaul Manafort, the international lobbyist and political operative who Trump retained to\nrun his campaign after Lewandowski was fired—and who agreed not to take a fee, amping\nup questions of quid pro quo—had spent thirty years representing dictators and corrupt\ndespots, amassing millions of dollars in a money trail that had long caught the eye of U.S.\ninvestigators. What’s more, when he joined the campaign, he was being pursued, his every\nfinancial step documented, by the billionaire Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who\nclaimed he stole $17 million from him in a crooked real estate scam.\nFor quite obvious reasons, no president before Trump and few politicians ever have\ncome out of the real estate business: a lightly regulated market, based on substantial debt\nwith exposure to frequent market fluctuations, it often depends on government favor, and\nis a preferred exchange currency for problem cash—money laundering. Trump’s son-inlaw\nJared Kushner, Jared’s father Charlie, Trump’s sons Don Jr. and Eric, and his daughter\nIvanka, as well as Trump himself, all supported their business enterprises to a greater or\nlesser extent working in the dubious limbo of international free cash flow and gray money.\nCharlie Kushner, to whose real estate business interests Trump’s son-in-law and most\nimportant aide was wholly tied, had already spent time in a federal prison for tax evasion,\nwitness tampering, and making illegal campaign donations.\nModern politicians and their staffs perform their most consequential piece of\nopposition research on themselves. If the Trump team had vetted their candidate, they\nwould have reasonably concluded that heightened ethical scrutiny could easily put them in\njeopardy. But Trump pointedly performed no such effort. Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime\npolitical adviser, explained to Steve Bannon that Trump’s psychic makeup made it\nimpossible for him to take such a close look at himself. Nor could he tolerate knowing that\nsomebody else would then know a lot about him—and therefore have something over him.\nAnd anyway, why take such a close and potentially threatening look, because what were\nthe chances of winning?\nNot only did Trump disregard the potential conflicts of his business deals and real\nestate holdings, he audaciously refused to release his tax returns. Why should he if he\nwasn’t going to win?\nWhat’s more, Trump refused to spend any time considering, however hypothetically,\ntransition matters, saying it was “bad luck”—but really meaning it was a waste of time.\nNor would he even remotely contemplate the issue of his holdings and conflicts.\nHe wasn’t going to win! Or losing was winning.\nTrump would be the most famous man in the world—a martyr to crooked Hillary\nClinton.\nHis daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared would have transformed themselves from\nrelatively obscure rich kids into international celebrities and brand ambassadors.\nSteve Bannon would become the de facto head of the Tea Party movement.\nKellyanne Conway would be a cable news star.\nReince Priebus and Katie Walsh would get their Republican Party back.\nMelania Trump could return to inconspicuously lunching.\nThat was the trouble-free outcome they awaited on November 8, 2016. Losing would\nwork out for everybody.\nShortly after eight o’clock that evening, when the unexpected trend—Trump might\nactually win—seemed confirmed, Don Jr. told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he called\nhim, looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania, to whom Donald Trump had made his\nsolemn guarantee, was in tears—and not of joy.\nThere was, in the space of little more than an hour, in Steve Bannon’s not unamused\nobservation, a befuddled Trump morphing into a disbelieving Trump and then into a quite\nhorrified Trump. But still to come was the final transformation: suddenly, Donald Trump\nbecame a man who believed that he deserved to be and was wholly capable of being the\npresident of the United States.\n2\nTRUMP TOWER\nO\nn the Saturday after the election, Donald Trump received a small group of wellwishers\nin his triplex apartment in Trump Tower. Even his close friends were still\nshocked and bewildered, and there was a dazed quality to the gathering. But Trump\nhimself was mostly looking at the clock.\nRupert Murdoch, heretofore doubtlessly certain Trump was a charlatan and a fool, said\nhe and his new wife, Jerry Hall, would pay a call on the president-elect. But Murdoch was\nlate—quite late. Trump kept assuring his guests that Rupert was on his way, coming soon.\nWhen some of the guests made a move to leave, Trump cajoled them to stay a little longer.\nYou’ll want to stay to see Rupert. (Or, one of the guests interpreted, you’ll want to stay to\nsee Trump with Rupert.)\nMurdoch, who, with his then wife, Wendi, had often socialized with Jared and Ivanka,\nin the past made little effort to hide his lack of interest in Trump. Murdoch’s fondness for\nKushner created a curious piece of the power dynamic between Trump and his son-in-law,\none that Kushner, with reasonable subtly, played to his advantage, often dropping\nMurdoch’s name into conversations with his father-in-law. When, in 2015, Ivanka Trump\ntold Murdoch that her father really, truly was going to run for president, Murdoch\ndismissed the possibility out of hand.\nBut now, the new president-elect—after the most astonishing upset in American history\n—was on tenterhooks waiting for Murdoch. “He’s one of the greats,” he told his guests,\nbecoming more agitated as he waited. “Really, he’s one of the greats, the last of the greats.\nYou have to stay to see him.”\nIt was a matched set of odd reversals—an ironic symmetry. Trump, perhaps not yet\nappreciating the difference between becoming president and elevating his social standing,\nwas trying mightily to curry favor with the previously disdainful media mogul. And\nMurdoch, finally arriving at the party he was in more than one way sorely late to, was as\nsubdued and thrown as everyone else, and struggling to adjust his view of a man who, for\nmore than a generation, had been at best a clown prince among the rich and famous.\n* * *\nMurdoch was hardly the only billionaire who had been dismissive of Trump. In the years\nbefore the election, Carl Icahn, whose friendship Trump often cited, and who Trump had\nsuggested he’d appoint to high office, openly ridiculed his fellow billionaire (whom he\nsaid was not remotely a billionaire).\nFew people who knew Trump had illusions about him. That was almost his appeal: he\nwas what he was. Twinkle in his eye, larceny in his soul.\nBut now he was the president-elect. And that, in a reality jujitsu, changed everything.\nSo say whatever you want about him, he had done this. Pulled the sword from the stone.\nThat meant something. Everything.\nThe billionaires had to rethink. So did everyone in the Trump orbit. The campaign\nstaff, now suddenly in a position to snag West Wing jobs—career- and history-making\njobs—had to see this odd, difficult, even ridiculous, and, on the face of it, ill-equipped\nperson in a new light. He had been elected president. So he was, as Kellyanne Conway\nliked to point out, by definition, presidential.\nStill, nobody had yet seen him be presidential—that is, make a public bow to political\nritual and propriety. Or even to exercise some modest self-control.\nOthers were now recruited and, despite their obvious impressions of the man, agreed to\nsign on. Jim Mattis, a retired four-star general, one of the most respected commanders in\nthe U.S. armed forces; Rex Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil; Scott Pruitt and Betsy DeVos,\nJeb Bush loyalists—all of them were now focused on the singular fact that while he might\nbe a peculiar figure, even an absurd-seeming one, he had been elected president.\nWe can make this work, is what everybody in the Trump orbit was suddenly saying. Or,\nat the very least, this could possibly work.\nIn fact, up close, Trump was not the bombastic and pugilistic man who had stirred\nrabid crowds on the campaign trail. He was neither angry nor combative. He may have\nbeen the most threatening and frightening and menacing presidential candidate in modern\nhistory, but in person he could seem almost soothing. His extreme self-satisfaction rubbed\noff. Life was sunny. Trump was an optimist—at least about himself. He was charming and\nfull of flattery; he focused on you. He was funny—self-deprecating even. And incredibly\nenergetic—Let’s do it whatever it is, let’s do it. He wasn’t a tough guy. He was “a big\nwarm-hearted monkey,” said Bannon, with rather faint praise.\nPayPal cofounder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel—really the only significant\nSilicon Valley voice to support Trump—was warned by another billionaire and longtime\nTrump friend that Trump would, in an explosion of flattery, offer Thiel his undying\nfriendship. Everybody says you’re great, you and I are going to have an amazing working\nrelationship, anything you want, call me and we’ll get it done! Thiel was advised not to\ntake Trump’s offer too seriously. But Thiel, who gave a speech supporting Trump at the\nRepublican Convention in Cleveland, reported back that, even having been forewarned, he\nabsolutely was certain of Trump’s sincerity when he said they’d be friends for life—only\nnever to basically hear from him again or have his calls returned. Still, power provides its\nown excuses for social lapses. Other aspects of the Trump character were more\nproblematic.\nAlmost all the professionals who were now set to join him were coming face to face\nwith the fact that it appeared he knew nothing. There was simply no subject, other than\nperhaps building construction, that he had substantially mastered. Everything with him\nwas off the cuff. Whatever he knew he seemed to have learned an hour before—and that\nwas mostly half-baked. But each member of the new Trump team was convincing him- or\nherself otherwise—because what did they know, the man had been elected president. He\noffered something, obviously. Indeed, while everybody in his rich-guy social circle knew\nabout his wide-ranging ignorance—Trump, the businessman, could not even read a\nbalance sheet, and Trump, who had campaigned on his deal-making skills, was, with his\ninattention to details, a terrible negotiator—they yet found him somehow instinctive. That\nwas the word. He was a force of personality. He could make you believe.\n“Is Trump a good person, an intelligent person, a capable person?” asked Sam\nNunberg, Trump’s longtime political aide. “I don’t even know. But I know he’s a star.”\nTrying to explain Trump’s virtues and his attraction, Piers Morgan—the British\nnewspaper man and ill-fated CNN anchor who had appeared on Celebrity Apprentice and\nstayed a loyal Trump friend—said it was all in Trump’s book The Art of the Deal.\nEverything that made him Trump and that defined his savvy, energy, and charisma was\nthere. If you wanted to know Trump, just read the book. But Trump had not written The\nArt of the Deal. His co-writer, Tony Schwartz, insisted that he had hardly contributed to it\nand might not even have read all of it. And that was perhaps the point. Trump was not a\nwriter, he was a character—a protagonist and hero.\nA pro wrestling fan who became a World Wrestling Entertainment supporter and\npersonality (inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame), Trump lived, like Hulk Hogan, as a\nreal-life fictional character. To the amusement of his friends, and unease of many of the\npeople now preparing to work for him at the highest levels of the federal government,\nTrump often spoke of himself in the third person. Trump did this. The Trumpster did that.\nSo powerful was this persona, or role, that he seemed reluctant, or unable, to give it up in\nfavor of being president—or presidential.\nHowever difficult he was, many of those now around him tried to justify his behavior\n—tried to find an explanation for his success in it, to understand it as an advantage, not a\nlimitation. For Steve Bannon, Trump’s unique political virtue was as an alpha male,\nmaybe the last of the alpha males. A 1950s man, a Rat Pack type, a character out of Mad\nMen.\nTrump’s understanding of his own essential nature was even more precise. Once,\ncoming back on his plane with a billionaire friend who had brought along a foreign model,\nTrump, trying to move in on his friend’s date, urged a stop in Atlantic City. He would\nprovide a tour of his casino. His friend assured the model that there was nothing to\nrecommend Atlantic City. It was a place overrun by white trash.\n“What is this ‘white trash’?” asked the model.\n“They’re people just like me,” said Trump, “only they’re poor.”\nHe looked for a license not to conform, not to be respectable. It was something of an\noutlaw prescription for winning—and winning, however you won, was what it was all\nabout.\nOr, as his friends would observe, mindful themselves not to be taken in, he simply had\nno scruples. He was a rebel, a disruptor, and, living outside the rules, contemptuous of\nthem. A close Trump friend who was also a good Bill Clinton friend found them eerily\nsimilar—except that Clinton had a respectable front and Trump did not.\nOne manifestation of this outlaw personality, for both Trump and Clinton, was their\nbrand of womanizing—and indeed, harassing. Even among world-class womanizers and\nharassers, they seemed exceptionally free of doubt or hesitation.\nTrump liked to say that one of the things that made life worth living was getting your\nfriends’ wives into bed. In pursuing a friend’s wife, he would try to persuade the wife that\nher husband was perhaps not what she thought. Then he’d have his secretary ask the friend\ninto his office; once the friend arrived, Trump would engage in what was, for him, more or\nless constant sexual banter. Do you still like having sex with your wife? How often? You\nmust have had a better fuck than your wife? Tell me about it. I have girls coming in from\nLos Angeles at three o’clock. We can go upstairs and have a great time. I promise … And\nall the while, Trump would have his friend’s wife on the speakerphone, listening in.\nPrevious presidents, and not just Clinton, have of course lacked scruples. What was, to\nmany of the people who knew Trump well, much more confounding was that he had\nmanaged to win this election, and arrive at this ultimate accomplishment, wholly lacking\nwhat in some obvious sense must be the main requirement of the job, what neuroscientists\nwould call executive function. He had somehow won the race for president, but his brain\nseemed incapable of performing what would be essential tasks in his new job. He had no\nability to plan and organize and pay attention and switch focus; he had never been able to\ntailor his behavior to what the goals at hand reasonably required. On the most basic level,\nhe simply could not link cause and effect.\nThe charge that Trump colluded with the Russians to win the election, which he\nscoffed at, was, in the estimation of some of his friends, a perfect example of his inability\nto connect the dots. Even if he hadn’t personally conspired with the Russians to fix the\nelection, his efforts to curry favor with, of all people, Vladimir Putin had no doubt left a\ntrail of alarming words and deeds likely to have enormous political costs.\nShortly after the election, his friend Ailes told him, with some urgency, “You’ve got to\nget right on Russia.” Even exiled from Fox News, Ailes still maintained a fabled\nintelligence network. He warned Trump of potentially damaging material coming his way.\n“You need to take this seriously, Donald.”\n“Jared has this,” said a happy Trump. “It’s all worked out.”\n* * *\nTrump Tower, next door to Tiffany and now headquarters of a populist revolution,\nsuddenly seemed like an alien spaceship—the Death Star—on Fifth Avenue. As the great\nand good and ambitious, as well as angry protesters and the curious hoi polloi, began\nbeating a path to the next president’s door, mazelike barricades were hurriedly thrown up\nto shield him.\nThe Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010 established funding for\npresidential nominees to start the process of vetting thousands of candidates for jobs in a\nnew administration, codifying policies that would determine the early actions of a new\nWhite House, and preparing for the handoff of bureaucratic responsibilities on January 20.\nDuring the campaign, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, the nominal head of the Trump\ntransition office, had to forcefully tell the candidate that he couldn’t redirect these funds,\nthat the law required him to spend the money and plan for a transition—even one he did\nnot expect to need. A frustrated Trump said he didn’t want to hear any more about it.\nThe day after the election, Trump’s close advisers—suddenly eager to be part of a\nprocess that almost everybody had ignored—immediately began blaming Christie for a\nlack of transition preparations. Hurriedly, the bare-bones transition team moved from\ndowntown Washington to Trump Tower.\nThis was certainly some of the most expensive real estate ever occupied by a transition\nteam (and, for that matter, a presidential campaign). And that was part of the point. It sent\na Trump-style message: we’re not only outsiders, but we’re more powerful than you\ninsiders. Richer. More famous. With better real estate.\nAnd, of course, it was personalized: his name, fabulously, was on the door. Upstairs\nwas his triplex apartment, vastly larger than the White House living quarters. Here was his\nprivate office, which he’d occupied since the 1980s. And here were the campaign and now\ntransition floors—firmly in his orbit and not that of Washington and the “swamp.”\nTrump’s instinct in the face of his unlikely, if not preposterous, success was the\nopposite of humility. It was, in some sense, to rub everybody’s face in it. Washington\ninsiders, or would-be insiders, would have to come to him. Trump Tower immediately\nupstaged the White House. Everybody who came to see the president-elect was\nacknowledging, or accepting, an outsider government. Trump forced them to endure what\nwas gleefully called by insiders the “perp walk” in front of press and assorted gawkers. An\nact of obeisance, if not humiliation.\nThe otherworldly sense of Trump Tower helped obscure the fact that few in the thin\nranks of Trump’s inner circle, with their overnight responsibility for assembling a\ngovernment, had almost any relevant experience. Nobody had a political background.\nNobody had a policy background. Nobody had a legislative background.\nPolitics is a network business, a who-you-know business. But unlike other presidentselect—all\nof whom invariably suffered from their own management defects—Trump did\nnot have a career’s worth of political and government contacts to call on. He hardly even\nhad his own political organization. For most of the last eighteen months on the road, it had\nbeen, at its core, a three-person enterprise: his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski\n(until he was forced out a month before the Republican National Convention); his\nspokesperson-bodyperson-intern, the campaign’s first hire, twenty-six-year-old Hope\nHicks; and Trump himself. Lean and mean and gut instincts—the more people you had to\ndeal with, Trump found, the harder it was to turn the plane around and get home to bed at\nnight.\nThe professional team—although in truth there was hardly a political professional\namong them—that had joined the campaign in August was a last-ditch bid to avoid\nhopeless humiliation. But these were people he’d worked with for just a few months.\nReince Priebus, getting ready to shift over from the RNC to the White House, noted,\nwith alarm, how often Trump offered people jobs on the spot, many of whom he had never\nmet before, for positions whose importance Trump did not particularly understand.\nAiles, a veteran of the Nixon, Reagan, and Bush 41 White Houses, was growing\nworried by the president-elect’s lack of immediate focus on a White House structure that\ncould serve and protect him. He tried to impress on Trump the ferocity of the opposition\nthat would greet him.\n“You need a son of a bitch as your chief of staff. And you need a son of a bitch who\nknows Washington,” Ailes told Trump not long after the election. “You’ll want to be your\nown son of a bitch, but you don’t know Washington.” Ailes had a suggestion: “Speaker\nBoehner.” (John Boehner had been the Speaker of the House until he was forced out in a\nTea Party putsch in 2011.)\n“Who’s that?” asked Trump.\nEverybody in Trump’s billionaire circle, concerned about his contempt for other\npeople’s expertise, tried to impress upon him the importance of the people, the many\npeople, he would need with him in the White House, people who understood Washington.\nYour people are more important than your policies. Your people are your policies.\n“Frank Sinatra was wrong,” said David Bossie, one of Trump’s longtime political\nadvisers. “If you can make it in New York, you can’t necessarily make it in Washington.”\n* * *\nThe nature of the role of the modern chief of staff is a focus of much White House\nscholarship. As much as the president himself, the chief of staff determines how the White\nHouse and executive branch—which employs 4 million people, including 1.3 million\npeople in the armed services—will run.\nThe job has been construed as deputy president, or chief operating officer, or even\nprime minister. Larger-than-life chiefs have included Richard Nixon’s H. R. Haldeman\nand Alexander Haig; Gerald Ford’s Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney; Jimmy Carter’s\nHamilton Jordan; Ronald Reagan’s James Baker; George H. W. Bush’s return of James\nBaker; Bill Clinton’s Leon Panetta, Erskine Bowles, and John Podesta; George W. Bush’s\nAndrew Card; and Barack Obama’s Rahm Emanuel and Bill Daley. Anyone studying the\nposition would conclude that a stronger chief of staff is better than a weaker one, and a\nchief of staff with a history in Washington and the federal government is better than an\noutsider.\nDonald Trump had little, if any, awareness of the history of or the thinking about this\nrole. Instead, he substituted his own management style and experience. For decades, he\nhad relied on longtime retainers, cronies, and family. Even though Trump liked to portray\nhis business as an empire, it was actually a discrete holding company and boutique\nenterprise, catering more to his peculiarities as proprietor and brand representative than to\nany bottom line or other performance measures.\nHis sons, Don Jr. and Eric—jokingly behind their backs known to Trump insiders as\nUday and Qusay, after the sons of Saddam Hussein—wondered if there couldn’t somehow\nbe two parallel White House structures, one dedicated to their father’s big-picture views,\npersonal appearances, and salesmanship and the other concerned with day-to-day\nmanagement issues. In this construct, they saw themselves tending to the day-to-day\noperations.\nOne of Trump’s early ideas was to recruit his friend Tom Barrack—part of his kitchen\ncabinet of real estate tycoons including Steven Roth and Richard Lefrak—and make him\nchief of staff.\nBarrack, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, is a starstruck real estate investor of\nlegendary acumen who owns Michael Jackson’s former oddball paradise, Neverland\nRanch. With Jeffrey Epstein—the New York financier who would become a tabloid\nregular after a guilty plea to one count of soliciting prostitution that sent him to jail in\n2008 in Palm Beach for thirteen months—Trump and Barrack were a 1980s and ’90s set\nof nightlife Musketeers.\nThe founder and CEO of the private equity firm Colony Capital, Barrack became a\nbillionaire making investments in distress debt investments in real estate around the world,\nincluding helping to bail out his friend Donald Trump. More recently, he had helped bail\nout his friend’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nHe watched with amusement Trump’s eccentric presidential campaign and brokered the\ndeal to have Paul Manafort replace Corey Lewandowski after Lewandowski fell out of\nfavor with Kushner. Then, as confounded as everyone else by the campaign’s continuing\nsuccesses, Barrack introduced the future president in warm and personal terms at the\nRepublican National Convention in July (at odds with its otherwise dark and belligerent\ntone).\nIt was Trump’s perfect fantasy that his friend Tom—an organizational whiz fully aware\nof his friend’s lack of interest in day-to-day management—would sign on to run the White\nHouse. This was Trump’s instant and convenient solution to the unforeseen circumstance\nof suddenly being president: to do it with his business mentor, confidant, investor, and\nfriend, someone whom acquaintances of the two men describe as “being one of the best\nDonald handlers.” In the Trump circle this was called the “two amigos” plan. (Epstein,\nwho remained close to Barrack, had been whitewashed out of the Trump biography.)\nBarrack, among the few people whose abilities Trump, a reflexive naysayer, didn’t\nquestion, could, in Trump’s hopeful view, really get things running smoothly and let\nTrump be Trump. It was, on Trump’s part, an uncharacteristic piece of self-awareness:\nDonald Trump might not know what he didn’t know, but he knew Tom Barrack knew. He\nwould run the business and Trump would sell the product—making American great again.\n#MAGA.\nFor Barrack, as for everybody around Trump, the election result was a kind of beyondbelief\nlottery-winning circumstance—your implausible friend becoming president. But\nBarrack, even after countless pleading and cajoling phone calls from Trump, finally had to\ndisappoint his friend, telling him “I’m just too rich.” He would never be able to untangle\nhis holdings and interests—including big investments in the Middle East—in a way that\nwould satisfy ethics watchdogs. Trump was unconcerned or in denial about his own\nbusiness conflicts, but Barrack saw nothing but hassle and cost for himself. Also, Barrack,\non his fourth marriage, had no appetite for having his colorful personal life—often, over\nthe years, conducted with Trump—become a public focus.\n* * *\nTrump’s fallback was his son-in-law. On the campaign, after months of turmoil and\noutlandishness (if not to Trump, to most others, including his family), Kushner had\nstepped in and become his effective body man, hovering nearby, speaking only when\nspoken to, but then always offering a calming and flattering view. Corey Lewandowski\ncalled Jared the butler. Trump had come to believe that his son-in-law, in part because he\nseemed to understand how to stay out of his way, was uniquely sagacious.\nIn defiance of law and tone, and everybody’s disbelieving looks, the president seemed\nintent on surrounding himself in the White House with his family. The Trumps, all of them\n—except for his wife, who, mystifyingly, was staying in New York—were moving in, all\nof them set to assume responsibilities similar to their status in the Trump Organization,\nwithout anyone apparently counseling against it.\nFinally, it was the right-wing diva and Trump supporter Ann Coulter who took the\npresident-elect aside and said, “Nobody is apparently telling you this. But you can’t. You\njust can’t hire your children.”\nTrump continued to insist that he had every right to his family’s help, while at the same\ntime asking for understanding. This is family, he said—“It’s a leettle, leettle tricky.” His\nstaffers understood not only the inherent conflicts and difficult legal issues in having\nTrump’s son-in-law run the White House, but that it would become, even more than it\nalready was, family first for Trump. After a great deal of pressure, he at least agreed not to\nmake his son-in-law the chief of staff—not officially, anyway.\n* * *\nIf not Barrack or Kushner, then, Trump thought the job should probably go to New Jersey\ngovernor Chris Christie, who, with Rudy Giuliani, comprised the sum total of his circle of\nfriends with actual political experience.\nChristie, like most Trump allies, fell in and out of favor. In the final weeks of the\ncampaign, Trump contemptuously measured Christie’s increasing distance from his losing\nenterprise, and then, with victory, his eagerness to get back in.\nTrump and Christie went back to Trump’s days trying—and failing—to become an\nAtlantic City gaming mogul. The Atlantic City gaming mogul. (Trump had long been\ncompetitive with and in awe of the Las Vegas gaming mogul Steve Wynn, whom Trump\nwould name finance chairman of the RNC.) Trump had backed Christie as he rose through\nNew Jersey politics. He admired Christie’s straight-talk style, and for a while, as Christie\nanticipated his own presidential run in 2012 and 2013—and as Trump was looking for a\nnext chapter for himself with the fading of The Apprentice, his reality TV franchise—\nTrump even wondered whether he might be a vice presidential possibility for Christie.\nEarly in the campaign, Trump said he wouldn’t have run against Christie but for the\nBridgegate scandal (which erupted when Christie’s associates closed traffic lanes on the\nGeorge Washington Bridge to undermine the mayor of a nearby town who was a Christie\nopponent, and which Trump privately justified as “just New Jersey hardball”). When\nChristie dropped out of the race in February 2016 and signed on with the Trump\ncampaign, he endured a torrent of ridicule for supporting his friend, whom he believed had\npromised him a clear track to the VP slot.\nIt had personally pained Trump not to be able to give it to him. But if the Republican\nestablishment had not wanted Trump, they had not wanted Christie almost as much. So\nChristie got the job of leading the transition and the implicit promise of a central job—\nattorney general or chief of staff.\nBut when he was the federal prosecutor in New Jersey, Christie had sent Jared’s father,\nCharles Kushner, to jail in 2005. Charlie Kushner, pursued by the feds for an income tax\ncheat, set up a scheme with a prostitute to blackmail his brother-in-law, who was planning\nto testify against him.\nVarious accounts, mostly offered by Christie himself, make Jared the vengeful hatchet\nman in Christie’s aborted Trump administration career. It was a kind of perfect sweetrevenge\nstory: the son of the wronged man (or, in this case—there’s little dispute—the\nguilty-as-charged man) uses his power over the man who wronged his family. But other\naccounts offer a subtler and in a way darker picture. Jared Kushner, like sons-in-law\neverywhere, tiptoes around his father-in-law, carefully displacing as little air as possible:\nthe massive and domineering older man, the reedy and pliant younger one. In the revised\ndeath-of-Chris-Christie story, it is not the deferential Jared who strikes back, but—in some\nsense even more satisfying for the revenge fantasy—Charlie Kushner himself who harshly\ndemands his due. It was his daughter-in-law who held the real influence in the Trump\ncircle, who delivered the blow. Ivanka told her father that Christie’s appointment as chief\nof staff or to any other high position would be extremely difficult for her and her family,\nand it would be best that Christie be removed from the Trump orbit altogether.\n* * *\nBannon was the heavy of the organization. Trump, who seemed awestruck by Bannon’s\nconversation—a mix of insults, historical riffs, media insights, right-wing bons mots, and\nmotivational truisms—now began suggesting Bannon to his circle of billionaires as chief\nof staff, only to have this notion soundly ridiculed and denounced. But Trump pronounced\nmany people in favor of it anyway.\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, Trump had labeled Bannon a flatterer for his\ncertainty that Trump would win. But now he had come to credit Bannon with something\nlike mystical powers. And in fact Bannon, with no prior political experience, was the only\nTrump insider able to offer a coherent vision of Trump’s populism—aka Trumpism.\nThe anti-Bannon forces—which included almost every non-Tea Party Republican—\nwere quick to react. Murdoch, a growing Bannon nemesis, told Trump that Bannon would\nbe a dangerous choice. Joe Scarborough, the former congressman and cohost of MSNBC’s\nMorning Joe, a favorite Trump show, privately told Trump “Washington will go up in\nflames” if Bannon became chief of staff, and, beginning a running theme, publicly\ndenigrated Bannon on the show.\nIn fact, Bannon presented even bigger problems than his politics: he was profoundly\ndisorganized, seemingly on the spectrum given what captured his single-minded focus to\nthe disregard of everything else. Might he be the worst manager who ever lived? He\nmight. He seemed incapable of returning a phone call. He answered emails in one word—\npartly a paranoia about email, but even more a controlling crypticness. He kept assistants\nand minders at constant bay. You couldn’t really make an appointment with Bannon, you\njust had to show up. And somehow, his own key lieutenant, Alexandra Preate, a\nconservative fundraiser and PR woman, was as disorganized as he was. After three\nmarriages, Bannon lived his bachelor’s life on Capitol Hill in a row house known as the\nBreitbart Embassy that doubled as the Breitbart office—the life of a messy party. No sane\nperson would hire Steven Bannon for a job that included making the trains run on time.\nHence, Reince Priebus.\n* * *\nFor the Hill, he was the only reasonable chief among the contenders, and he quickly\nbecame the subject of intense lobbying by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority\nLeader Mitch McConnell. If they were going to have to deal with an alien like Donald\nTrump, then best they do it with the help of a member of their own kind.\nPriebus, forty-five, was neither politician nor policy wonk nor strategist. He was\npolitical machine worker, one of the oldest professions. A fundraiser.\nA working-class kid originally from New Jersey and then Wisconsin, at thirty-two he\nmade his first and last run for elective office: a failed bid for Wisconsin state senate. He\nbecame the chairman of the state party and then the general counsel of the Republican\nNational Committee. In 2011 he stepped up to chairmanship of the RNC. Priebus’s\npolitical cred came from appeasing the Tea Party in Wisconsin, and his association with\nWisconsin governor Scott Walker, a rising Republican star (and, briefly—very briefly—\nthe 2016 front-runner).\nWith significant parts of the Republican Party inalterably opposed to Trump, and with\nan almost universal belief within the party that Trump would go down to ignominious\ndefeat, taking the party with him, Priebus was under great pressure after Trump captured\nthe nomination to shift resources down the ticket and even to abandon the Trump\ncampaign entirely.\nConvinced himself that Trump was hopeless, Priebus nevertheless hedged his bets. The\nfact that he did not abandon Trump entirely became a possible margin of victory and made\nPriebus something of a hero (equally, in the Kellyanne Conway version, if they had lost,\nhe would have been a reasonable target). He became the default choice for chief.\nAnd yet his entry into the Trump inner circle caused Priebus his share of uncertainty\nand bewilderment. He came out of his first long meeting with Trump thinking it had been\na disconcertingly weird experience. Trump talked nonstop and constantly repeated\nhimself.\n“Here’s the deal,” a close Trump associate told Priebus. “In an hour meeting with him\nyou’re going to hear fifty-four minutes of stories and they’re going to be the same stories\nover and over again. So you have to have one point to make and you have to pepper it in\nwhenever you can.”\nThe Priebus appointment as chief of staff, announced in mid-November, also put\nBannon on a coequal level. Trump was falling back on his own natural inclinations to let\nnobody have real power. Priebus, even with the top job, would be a weaker sort of figure,\nin the traditional mold of most Trump lieutenants over the years. The choice also worked\nwell for the other would-be chiefs. Tom Barrack could easily circumvent Priebus and\ncontinue to speak directly to Trump. Jared Kushner’s position as son-in-law and soon top\naide would not be impeded. And Steve Bannon, reporting directly to Trump, remained the\nundisputed voice of Trumpism in the White House.\nThere would be, in other words, one chief of staff in name—the unimportant one—and\nvarious others, more important, in practice, ensuring both chaos and Trump’s own\nundisputed independence.\nJim Baker, chief of staff for both Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and almost\neverybody’s model for managing the West Wing, advised Priebus not to take the job.\n* * *\nThe transmogrification of Trump from joke candidate, to whisperer for a disaffected\ndemographic, to risible nominee, to rent-in-the-fabric-of-time president-elect, did not\ninspire in him any larger sense of sober reflection. After the shock of it, he immediately\nseemed to rewrite himself as the inevitable president.\nOne instance of his revisionism, and of the new stature he now seemed to assume as\npresident, involved the lowest point of the campaign—the Billy Bush tape.\nHis explanation, in an off-the-record conversation with a friendly cable anchor, was\nthat it “really wasn’t me.”\nThe anchor acknowledged how unfair it was to be characterized by a single event.\n“No,” said Trump, “it wasn’t me. I’ve been told by people who understand this stuff\nabout how easy it is to alter these things and put in voices and completely different\npeople.”\nHe was the winner and now expected to be the object of awe, fascination, and favor.\nHe expected this to be binary: a hostile media would turn into a fannish one.\nAnd yet here he was, the winner who was treated with horror and depredations by a\nmedia that in the past, as a matter of course and protocol, could be depended on to shower\nlavish deference on an incoming president no matter who he was. (Trump’s shortfall of\nthree million votes continued to rankle and was a subject best avoided.) It was nearly\nincomprehensible to him that the same people—that is, the media—who had violently\ncriticized him for saying he might dispute the election result were now calling him\nillegitimate.\nTrump was not a politician who could parse factions of support and opprobrium; he\nwas a salesman who needed to make a sale. “I won. I am the winner. I am not the loser,”\nhe repeated, incredulously, like a mantra.\nBannon described Trump as a simple machine. The On switch was full of flattery, the\nOff switch full of calumny. The flattery was dripping, slavish, cast in ultimate\nsuperlatives, and entirely disconnected from reality: so-and-so was the best, the most\nincredible, the ne plus ultra, the eternal. The calumny was angry, bitter, resentful, ever a\ncasting out and closing of the iron door.\nThis was the nature of Trump’s particular salesmanship. His strategic belief was that\nthere was no reason not to heap excessive puffery on a prospect. But if the prospect was\nruled out as a buyer, there was no reason not to heap scorn and lawsuits on him or her.\nAfter all, if they don’t respond to sucking up, they might respond to piling on. Bannon felt\n—perhaps with overconfidence—that Trump could be easily switched on and off.\nAgainst the background of a mortal war of wills—with the media, the Democrats, and\nthe swamp—that Bannon was encouraging him to wage, Trump could also be courted. In\nsome sense, he wanted nothing so much as to be courted.\nAmazon’s Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, which had become one of the\nmany Trump media bêtes noires in the media world, nevertheless took pains to reach out\nnot only to the presidentelect but to his daughter Ivanka. During the campaign, Trump said\nAmazon was getting “away with murder taxwise” and that if he won, “Oh, do they have\nproblems.” Now Trump was suddenly praising Bezos as “a top-level genius.” Elon Musk,\nin Trump Tower, pitched Trump on the new administration’s joining him in his race to\nMars, which Trump jumped at. Stephen Schwarzman, the head of the Blackstone Group—\nand a Kushner friend—offered to organize a business council for Trump, which Trump\nembraced. Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor and fashion industry queen, had hoped to be\nnamed America’s ambassador to the UK under Obama and, when that didn’t happen,\nclosely aligned herself with Hillary Clinton. Now Wintour arrived at Trump Tower (but\nrefused to do the perp walk) and suggested that she become Trump’s ambassador to the\nCourt of St. James’s. And Trump was inclined to entertain the idea. (“Fortunately,” said\nBannon, “there was no chemistry.”)\nOn December 14, a high-level delegation from Silicon Valley came to Trump Tower to\nmeet the president-elect, though Trump had repeatedly criticized the tech industry\nthroughout the campaign. Later that afternoon, Trump called Rupert Murdoch, who asked\nhim how the meeting had gone.\n“Oh, great, just great,” said Trump. “Really, really good. These guys really need my\nhelp. Obama was not very favorable to them, too much regulation. This is really an\nopportunity for me to help them.”\n“Donald,” said Murdoch, “for eight years these guys had Obama in their pocket. They\npractically ran the administration. They don’t need your help.”\n“Take this H-1B visa issue. They really need these H-1B visas.”\nMurdoch suggested that taking a liberal approach to H-1B visas might be hard to\nsquare with his immigration promises. But Trump seemed unconcerned, assuring\nMurdoch, “We’ll figure it out.”\n“What a fucking idiot,” said Murdoch, shrugging, as he got off the phone.\n* * *\nTen days before Donald Trump’s inauguration as the forty-fifth president, a group of\nyoung Trump staffers—the men in regulation Trump suits and ties, the women in the\nTrump-favored look of high boots, short skirts, and shoulder-length hair—were watching\nPresident Barack Obama give his farewell speech as it streamed on a laptop in the\ntransition offices.\n“Mr. Trump said he’s never once listened to a whole Obama speech,” said one of the\nyoung people authoritatively.\n“They’re so boring,” said another.\nWhile Obama bade his farewell, preparations for Trump’s first press conference since\nthe election, to be held the next day, were under way down the hall. The plan was to make\na substantial effort to show that the president-elect’s business conflicts would be addressed\nin a formal and considered way.\nUp until now, Trump’s view was that he’d been elected because of those conflicts—his\nbusiness savvy, connections, experience, and brand—not in spite of them, and that it was\nludicrous for anyone to think he could untangle himself even if he wanted to. Indeed, to\nreporters and anyone else who would listen, Kellyanne Conway offered on Trump’s behalf\na self-pitying defense about how great his sacrifice had already been.\nAfter fanning the flames of his intention to disregard rules regarding conflicts of\ninterest, now, in a bit of theater, he would take a generous new tack. Standing in the lobby\nof Trump Towner next to a table stacked high with document folders and legal papers, he\nwould describe the vast efforts that had been made to do the impossible and how,\nhenceforth, he would be exclusively focused on the nation’s business.\nBut suddenly this turned out to be quite beside the point.\nFusion GPS, an opposition research company (founded by former journalists, it\nprovided information to private clients), had been retained by Democratic Party interests.\nFusion had hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy, in June 2016, to help investigate\nTrump’s repeated brags about his relationship with Vladimir Putin and the nature of\nTrump’s relationship with the Kremlin. With reports from Russian sources, many\nconnected to Russian intelligence, Steele assembled a damaging report—now dubbed the\n“dossier”—suggesting that Donald Trump was being blackmailed by the Putin\ngovernment. In September, Steele briefed reporters from the New York Times, the\nWashington Post, Yahoo! News, the New Yorker, and CNN. All declined to use this\nunverified information, with its unclear provenance, especially given that it was about an\nunlikely election winner.\nBut the day before the scheduled press conference, CNN broke details of the Steele\ndossier. Almost immediately thereafter, Buzzfeed published the entire report—an itemized\nbacchanal of beyond-the-pale behavior.\nOn the verge of Trump’s ascendancy to the presidency, the media, with its singular\nvoice on Trump matters, was propounding a conspiracy of vast proportions. The theory,\nsuddenly presented as just this side of a likelihood, was that the Russians had suborned\nDonald Trump during a trip to Moscow with a crude blackmail scheme involving\nprostitutes and videotaped sexual acts pushing new boundaries of deviance (including\n“golden showers”) with prostitutes and videotaped sex acts. The implicit conclusion: a\ncompromised Trump had conspired with the Russians to steal the election and to install\nhim in the White House as Putin’s dupe.\nIf this was true, then the nation stood at one of the most extraordinary moments in the\nhistory of democracy, international relations, and journalism.\nIf it was not true—and it was hard to fathom a middle ground—then it would seem to\nsupport the Trump view (and the Bannon view) that the media, in also quite a dramatic\ndevelopment in the history of democracy, was so blinded by an abhorrence and revulsion,\nboth ideological and personal, for the democratically elected leader that it would pursue\nany avenue to take him down. Mark Hemingway, in the conservative, but anti-Trump,\nWeekly Standard, argued the novel paradox of two unreliable narrators dominating\nAmerican public life: the president-elect spoke with little information and frequently no\nfactual basis, while “the frame the media has chosen to embrace is that everything the man\ndoes is, by default, unconstitutional or an abuse of power.”\nOn the afternoon of January 11, these two opposing perceptions faced off in the lobby\nof Trump Tower: the political antichrist, a figure of dark but buffoonish scandal, in the\npocket of America’s epochal adversary, versus the would-be revolutionary-mob media,\ndrunk on virtue, certainty, and conspiracy theories. Each represented, for the other side, a\nwholly discredited “fake” version of reality.\nIf these character notes seemed comic-book in style, that was exactly how the press\nconference unfolded.\nFirst Trump’s encomiums to himself:\n“I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created… .”\nA smattering of the issues before him:\n“Veterans with a little cancer can’t see a doctor until they are terminal… .”\nThen the incredulity:\n“I was in Russia years ago with the Ms. Universe contest—did very very well—I tell\neveryone be careful, because you don’t want to see yourself on television—cameras all\nover the place. And again, not just Russia, all over. So would anyone really believe that\nstory? I’m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way. Believe me.”\nThen the denial:\n“I have no deals in Russia, I have no deal that could happen in Russia because we’ve\nstayed away, and I have no loans with Russia. I have to say one thing … Over the\nweekend I was offered two billion dollars to do a deal in Dubai and I turned it down. I\ndidn’t have to turn it down, because as you know I have a no-conflict situation as\npresident. I didn’t know about that until three months ago but it’s a nice thing to have. But\nI didn’t want to take advantage of something. I have a no-conflict-of-interest provision as\npresident. I could actually run my business, run my business and run government at the\nsame time. I don’t like the way that looks but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I\ncould run the Trump organization, a great, great company, and I could run the country, but\nI don’t want to do that.”\nThen the direct attack on CNN, his nemesis:\n“Your organization is terrible. Your organization is terrible… . Quiet … quiet … don’t\nbe rude … Don’t be… . No, I’m not going to give you a question … I’m not going to give\nyou a question… . You are fake news… .”\nAnd in summation:\n“That report first of all should never have been printed because it’s not worth the paper\nit’s printed on. I will tell you that should never ever happen. Twenty-two million accounts\nwere hacked by China. That’s because we have no defense, because we’re run by people\nwho don’t know what they’re doing. Russia will have far greater respect for our country\nwhen I’m leading it. And not just Russia, China, which has taken total advantage of us.\nRussia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do\nunder past administrations… .”\nNot only did the president-elect wear his deep and bitter grievances on his sleeve, but it\nwas now clear that the fact of having been elected president would not change his\nunfiltered, apparently uncontrollable, utterly shoot-from-the-hip display of wounds,\nresentments, and ire.\n“I think he did a fantastic job,” said Kellyanne Conway after the news conference. “But\nthe media won’t say that. They never will.”\n3\nDAY ONE\nJ\nared Kushner at thirty-six prided himself on his ability to get along with older men. By\nthe time of Donald Trump’s inauguration he had become the designated intermediary\nbetween his father-in-law and the establishment, such as it was—more moderate\nRepublicans, corporate interests, the New York rich. Having a line to Kushner seemed to\noffer an alarmed elite a handle on a volatile situation.\nSeveral of his father-in-law’s circle of confidants also confided in Kushner—often\nconfiding their worries about their friend, the presidentelect.\n“I give him good advice about what he needs to do and for three hours the next day he\ndoes it, and then goes hopelessly off script,” complained one of them to Trump’s son-inlaw.\nKushner, whose pose was to take things in and not give much back, said he\nunderstood the frustration.\nThese powerful figures tried to convey a sense of real-world politics, which they all\nclaimed to comprehend at some significantly higher threshold than the soon-to-be\npresident. They were all concerned that Trump did not understand what he was up against.\nThat there was simply not enough method to his madness.\nEach of these interlocutors provided Kushner with something of a tutorial on the\nlimitations of presidential power—that Washington was as much designed to frustrate and\nundermine presidential power as to accommodate it.\n“Don’t let him piss off the press, don’t let him piss off the Republican Party, don’t\nthreaten congressmen because they will fuck you if you do, and most of all don’t let him\npiss off the intel community,” said one national Republican figure to Kushner. “If you fuck\nwith the intel community they will figure out a way to get back at you and you’ll have two\nor three years of a Russian investigation, and every day something else will leak out.”\nA vivid picture was painted for the preternaturally composed Kushner of spies and\ntheir power, of how secrets were passed out of the intelligence community to former\nmembers of the community or to other allies in Congress or even to persons in the\nexecutive branch and then to the press.\nOne of Kushner’s now-frequent wise-men callers was Henry Kissinger. Kissinger, who\nhad been a front-row witness when the bureaucracy and intelligence community revolted\nagainst Richard Nixon, outlined the kinds of mischief, and worse, that the new\nadministration could face.\n“Deep state,” the left-wing and right-wing notion of an intelligence-network\npermanent-government conspiracy, part of the Breitbart lexicon, became the Trump team\nterm of art: he’s poked the deep state bear.\nNames were put to this: John Brennan, the CIA director; James Clapper, the director of\nnational intelligence; Susan Rice, the outgoing National Security Advisor; and Ben\nRhodes, Rice’s deputy and an Obama favorite.\nMovie scenarios were painted: a cabal of intelligence community myrmidons, privy to\nall sorts of damning evidence of Trump’s recklessness and dubious dealings, would, with a\nstrategic schedule of wounding, embarrassing, and distracting leaks, make it impossible\nfor the Trump White House to govern.\nWhat Kushner was told, again and again, is that the president had to make amends. He\nhad to reach out. He had to mollify. These were forces not to be trifled with was said with\nutmost gravity.\nThroughout the campaign and even more forcefully after the election, Trump had\ntargeted the American intelligence community—the CIA, FBI, NSC, and, altogether,\nseventeen separate intelligence agencies—as incompetent and mendacious. (His message\nwas “on auto pilot,” said one aide.) Among the various and plentiful Trump mixed\nmessages at odds with conservative orthodoxy, this was a particularly juicy one. His case\nagainst American intelligence included its faulty information about weapons of mass\ndestruction that preceded the Iraq war, a litany of Obama Afghanistan-Iraq-Syria-Libya\nand other war-related intelligence failures, and, more recently, but by no means least of all,\nintelligence leaks regarding his purported Russian relationships and subterfuges.\nTrump’s criticism seemed to align him with the left in its half century of making a\nbogeyman of American intelligence agencies. But, in quite some reversal, the liberals and\nthe intelligence community were now aligned in their horror of Donald Trump. Much of\nthe left—which had resoundingly and scathingly rejected the intelligence community’s\nunambiguous assessment of Edward Snowden as a betrayer of national secrets rather than\na well-intentioned whistle-blower—now suddenly embraced the intelligence community’s\nauthority in its suggestion of Trump’s nefarious relationships with the Russians.\nTrump was dangerously out in the cold.\nHence, Kushner thought it was sensible to make a reach-out to the CIA among the first\norders of the new administration’s business.\n* * *\nTrump did not enjoy his own inauguration. He had hoped for a big blowout. Tom Barrack,\nthe would-be showman—in addition to Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch, he had\nbought Miramax Pictures from Disney with the actor Rob Lowe—may have declined the\nchief of staff job, but, as part of his shadow involvement with his friend’s White House, he\nstepped up to raise the money for the inaugural and to create an event that—seemingly\nquite at odds with the new president’s character, and with Steve Bannon’s wish for a nofrills\npopulist inauguration—he promised would have a “soft sensuality” and “poetic\ncadence.” But Trump, imploring friends to use their influence to nail some of the A-level\nstars who were snubbing the event, started to get angry and hurt that stars were determined\nto embarrass him. Bannon, a soothing voice as well as a professional agitator, tried to\nargue the dialectical nature of what they had achieved (without using the word\n“dialectical”). Because Trump’s success was beyond measure, or certainly beyond all\nexpectations, the media and the liberals had to justify their own failure, he explained to the\nnew president.\nIn the hours before the inauguration, the whole of Washington seemed to be holding its\nbreath. On the evening before Trump was sworn in, Bob Corker, the Republican senator\nfrom Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opened his\nremarks as the featured speaker at a gathering at the Jefferson Hotel with the existential\nquestion, “Where are things going?” He paused for a moment and then answered, as\nthough from some deep well of bewilderment, “I have no idea.”\nLater that evening, a concert at the Lincoln Memorial, part of an always awkward\neffort to import pop culture to Washington, ended up, absent any star power, with Trump\nhimself taking the stage as the featured act, angrily insisting to aides that he could outdraw\nany star.\nDissuaded by his staff from staying at the Trump International Hotel in Washington\nand regretting his decision, the president-elect woke up on inaugural morning complaining\nabout the accommodations at Blair House, the official guest residence across the street\nfrom the White House. Too hot, bad water pressure, bad bed.\nHis temper did not improve. Throughout the morning, he was visibly fighting with his\nwife, who seemed on the verge of tears and would return to New York the next day;\nalmost every word he addressed to her was sharp and peremptory. Kellyanne Conway had\ntaken up Melania Trump as a personal PR mission, promoting the new First Lady as a\nvital pillar of support for the president and a helpful voice in her own right, and was trying\nto convince Trump that she could have an important role in the White House. But, in\ngeneral, the Trumps’ relationship was one of those things nobody asked too many\nquestions about—another mysterious variable in the presidential mood.\nAt the ceremonial meeting of the soon-to-be-new president and the soon-to-be-old\npresident at the White House, which took place just before they set off for the swearing-in\nceremony, Trump believed the Obamas acted disdainfully—“very arrogant”—toward him\nand Melania. Instead of wearing a game face, going into the inaugural events, the\npresident-elect wore what some around him had taken to calling his golf face: angry and\npissed off, shoulders hunched, arms swinging, brow furled, lips pursed. This had become\nthe public Trump—truculent Trump.\nAn inauguration is supposed to be a love-in. The media gets a new and upbeat story.\nFor the party faithful, happy times are here again. For the permanent government—the\nswamp—it’s a chance to curry favor and seek new advantage. For the country, it’s a\ncoronation. But Bannon had three messages or themes he kept trying to reinforce with his\nboss: his presidency was going to be different—as different as any since Andrew\nJackson’s (he was supplying the less-than-well-read president-elect with Jackson-related\nbooks and quotes); they knew who their enemies were and shouldn’t fall into the trap of\ntrying to make them their friends, because they wouldn’t be; and so, from day one, they\nshould consider themselves on a war footing. While this spoke to Trump’s combative\n“counterpuncher” side, it was hard on his eager-to-be-liked side. Bannon saw himself as\nmanaging these two impulses, emphasizing the former and explaining to his boss why\nhaving enemies here created friends somewhere else.\nIn fact, Trump’s aggrieved mood became a perfect match for the Bannon-written\naggrieved inaugural address. Much of the sixteen-minute speech was part of Bannon’s\ndaily joie de guerre patter—his take-back-the-country America-first, carnage-everywhere\nvision for the country. But it actually became darker and more forceful when filtered\nthrough Trump’s disappointment and delivered with his golf face. The administration\npurposely began on a tone of menace—a Bannon-driven message to the other side that the\ncountry was about to undergo profound change. Trump’s wounded feelings—his sense of\nbeing shunned and unloved on the very day he became president—helped send that\nmessage. When he came off the podium after delivering his address, he kept repeating,\n“Nobody will forget this speech.”\nGeorge W. Bush, on the dais, supplied what seemed likely to become the historic\nfootnote to the Trump address: “That’s some weird shit.”\n* * *\nTrump, despite his disappointment at Washington’s failure to properly greet and celebrate\nhim, was, like a good salesman, an optimist. Salesmen, whose primary characteristic and\nmain asset is their ability to keep selling, constantly recast the world in positive terms.\nDiscouragement for everyone else is merely the need to improve reality for them.\nBy the next morning, Trump was soliciting affirmation of his view that the\ninauguration had been a great success. “That crowd went all the way back. That were\nmore than a million people at least, right?” He made a series of phone calls to friends who\nlargely yes’d him on this. Kushner confirmed a big crowd. Conway did nothing to\ndissuade him. Priebus agreed. Bannon made a joke.\nAmong Trump’s first moves as president was to have a series of inspirational\nphotographs in the West Wing replaced with images of big crowd scenes at his inaugural\nceremony.\nBannon had come to rationalize Trump’s reality distortions. Trump’s hyperbole,\nexaggerations, flights of fancy, improvisations, and general freedom toward and mangling\nof the facts, were products of the basic lack of guile, pretense, and impulse control that\nhelped create the immediacy and spontaneity that was so successful with so many on the\nstump—while so horrifying to so many others.\nFor Bannon, Obama was the north star of aloofness. “Politics,” said Bannon with an\nauthority that belayed the fact that until the previous August he had never worked in\npolitics, “is a more immediate game than he ever played it.” Trump was, for Bannon, a\nmodern-day William Jennings Bryan. (Bannon had long talked about the need for a new\nWilliams Jennings Bryan in right-wing politics, with friends assuming Bannon meant\nhimself.) At the turn of the twentieth century, Bryan had enthralled rural audiences with\nhis ability to speak passionately and extemporaneously for apparently unlimited periods of\ntime. Trump compensated—in the theory of some intimates, including Bannon—for his\ndifficulties with reading, writing, and close focus with an improvisational style that\nproduced, if not exactly a William Jennings Bryan effect, certainly close to the exact\nopposite of the Obama effect.\nIt was part hortatory, part personal testimony, part barstool blow-hard, a rambling,\ndisjointed, digressive, what-me-worry approach that combined aspects of cable television\nrage, big-tent religious revivalism, Borscht Belt tummler, motivational speaking, and\nYouTube vlogging. Charisma in American politics had come to define an order of charm,\nwit, and style—a coolness. But another sort of American charisma was more in the\nChristian evangelical vein, an emotional, experiential spectacle.\nThe Trump campaign had built its central strategy around great rallies regularly\nattracting tens of thousands, a political phenomenon that the Democrats both failed to\nheed and saw as a sign of Trump’s limited appeal. For the Trump team, this style, this\nunmediated connection—his speeches, his tweets, his spontaneous phone calls to radio\nand television shows, and, often, to anyone who would listen—was revelatory, a new,\npersonal, and inspirational politics. For the other side, it was clownishness that, at best,\naspired to the kind of raw, authoritarian demagoguery that had long been discredited by\nand assigned to history and that, when it appeared in American politics, reliably failed.\nWhile the advantages of this style for the Trump team were now very clear, the\nproblem was that it often—in fact regularly—produced assertions that were not remotely\ntrue.\nThis had led increasingly to the two-different-realities theory of Trump politics. In the\none reality, which encompassed most of Trump’s supporters, his nature was understood\nand appreciated. He was the anti-wonk. He was the counterexpert. His was the gut call. He\nwas the everyman. He was jazz (some, in the telling, made it rap), everybody else an\nearnest folk music. In the other reality, in which resided most of his antagonists, his\nvirtues were grievous if not mental and criminal flaws. In this reality lived the media,\nwhich, with its conclusion of a misbegotten and bastard presidency, believed it could\ndiminish him and wound him (and wind him up) and rob him of all credibility by\nrelentlessly pointing out how literally wrong he was.\nThe media, adopting a “shocked, shocked” morality, could not fathom how being\nfactually wrong was not an absolute ending in itself. How could this not utterly shame\nhim? How could his staff defend him? The facts were the facts! Defying them, or ignoring\nthem, or subverting them, made you a liar—intending to deceive, bearing false witness. (A\nminor journalism controversy broke out about whether these untruths should be called\ninaccuracies or lies.)\nIn Bannon’s view: (1) Trump was never going to change; (2) trying to get him to\nchange would surely cramp his style; (3) it didn’t matter to Trump supporters; (4) the\nmedia wasn’t going to like him anyway; (5) it was better to play against the media than to\nthe media; (6) the media’s claim to be the protector of factual probity and accuracy was\nitself a sham; (7) the Trump revolution was an attack on conventional assumptions and\nexpertise, so better to embrace Trump’s behavior than try to curb it or cure it.\nThe problem was that, for all he was never going to stick to a script (“his mind just\ndoesn’t work that way” was one of the internal rationalizations), Trump craved media\napproval. But, as Bannon emphasized, he was never going to get the facts right, nor was\nhe ever going to acknowledge that he got them wrong, so therefore he was not going to get\nthat approval. This meant, next best thing, that he had to be aggressively defended against\nthe media’s disapproval.\nThe problem here was that the more vociferous the defense—mostly of assertions that\ncould easily be proved wrong—the more the media redoubled its attacks and censure.\nWhat’s more, Trump was receiving the censure of his friends, too. And it was not only\ncalls from friends worried about him, but staffers calling people to call him and say\nSimmer down. “Who do you have in there?” said Joe Scarborough in a frantic call. “Who’s\nthe person you trust? Jared? Who can talk you through this stuff before you decided to act\non it?”\n“Well,” said the president, “you won’t like the answer, but the answer is me. Me. I talk\nto myself.”\nHence, within twenty-four hours of the inauguration, the president had invented a\nmillion or so people who did not exist. He sent his new press secretary, Sean Spicer—\nwhose personal mantra would shortly become “You can’t make this shit up”—to argue his\ncase in a media moment that turned Spicer, quite a buttoned-down political professional,\ninto a national joke, which he seemed destined to never recover from. To boot, the\npresident blamed Spicer for not making the million phantom souls seem real.\nIt was the first presidential instance of what the campaign regulars had learned over\nmany months: on the most basic level, Trump just did not, as Spicer later put it, give a\nfuck. You could tell him whatever you wanted, but he knew what he knew, and if what\nyou said contradicted what he knew, he simply didn’t believe you.\nThe next day Kellyanne Conway, her aggressive posture during the campaign turning\nmore and more to petulance and self-pity, asserted the new president’s right to claim\n“alternative facts.” As it happened, Conway meant to say “alternative information,” which\nat least would imply there might be additional data. But as uttered, it certainly sounded\nlike the new administration was claiming the right to recast reality. Which, in a sense, it\nwas. Although, in Conway’s view, it was the media doing the recasting, making a\nmountain (hence “fake news”) out of a molehill (an honest minor exaggeration, albeit of\nvast proportions).\nAnyway, the frequently asked question about whether Trump would continue his\nunsupervised and often inexplicable tweets now that he was officially in the White House\nand the president of the United States—a question as hotly asked inside the White House\nas out—was answered: he would.\nThis was his fundamental innovation in governing: regular, uncontrolled bursts of\nanger and spleen.\n* * *\nThe president’s immediate official business, however, was to make nice with the CIA.\nOn Saturday, January 21, in an event organized by Kushner, the president, in his first\npresidential act, paid a call on Langley to, in Bannon’s hopeful description, “play some\npolitics.” In carefully prepared remarks in his first act as president, he would lay some of\nthe famous Trump flattery on the CIA and the rest of the sprawling, and leaking, U.S.\nintelligence world.\nNot taking off his dark overcoat, lending him quite a hulking gangster look, pacing in\nfront of the CIA’s wall of stars for its fallen agents, in front of a crowd of about three\nhundred agency personnel and a group of White House staffers, and, suddenly, in a mood\nof sleepless cockiness and pleasure at having a captive crowd, the new president,\ndisregarding his text, launched into what we could confidently call some of the most\npeculiar remarks ever delivered by an American president.\n“I know a lot about West Point, I’m a person who very strongly believes in academics.\nEvery time I say I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for 35 years, who did a\nfantastic job in so many ways academically—he was an academic genius—and then they\nsay, Is Donald Trump an intellectual? Trust me, I’m like a smart person.”\nWhich was all somehow by way of praise for the new, soon-to-be-confirmed CIA\ndirector, Mike Pompeo, who had attended West Point and who Trump had brought with\nhim to stand in the crowd—and who now found himself as bewildered as everyone else.\n“You know when I was young. Of course I feel young—I feel like I was 30 … 35 …\n39 … . Somebody said, Are you young? I said, I think I’m young. I was stopping in the\nfinal months of the campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops—speeches, speeches in\nfront of twenty-five, thirty thousand people … fifteen, nineteen thousand. I feel young—I\nthink we’re all so young. When I was young we were always winning things in this\ncountry. We’d win with trade, we’d win with wars—at a certain age I remembering\nhearing from one of my instructors, the United States has never lost a war. And then, after\nthat, it’s like we haven’t won anything. You know the old expression, to the victor belongs\nthe spoils? You remember I always say, keep the oil.”\n“Who should keep the oil?” asked a bewildered CIA employee, leaning over to a\ncolleague in the back of the room.\n“I wasn’t a fan of Iraq, I didn’t want to go into Iraq. But I will tell you when we were\nin we got out wrong and I always said in addition to that keep the oil. Now I said it for\neconomic reasons, but if you think about it, Mike”—he called out across the room,\naddressing the soon-to-be director—“if we kept the oil we wouldn’t have ISIS because\nthat’s where they made their money in the first place, so that’s why we should have kept\nthe oil. But okay—maybe you’ll have another chance—but the fact is we should have kept\nthe oil.”\nThe president paused and smiled with evident satisfaction.\n“The reason you are my first stop, as you know I have a running war with the media,\nthey are among the most dishonest human beings on earth, and they sort of made it sound\nlike I had a feud with the intelligence community and I just want to let you know the\nreason you’re the number one stop is exactly the opposite, exactly, and they understand\nthat. I was explaining about the numbers. We did, we did a thing yesterday at the speech.\nDid everybody like the speech? You had to like it. But we had a massive field of people.\nYou saw them. Packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show\nan empty field and I say, Wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out—the field was—it\nlooked like a million, million and half people. They showed a field where there were\npractically nobody standing there. And they said Donald Trump did not draw well and I\nsaid it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down\nand said we’re not going to let it rain on your speech and in fact when I first started I said,\nOooh no, first line I got hit by a couple of drops, and I said, Oh this is too bad, but we’ll\ngo right through it, the truth is it stopped immediately… .”\n“No, it didn’t,” one of the staffers traveling with him said reflexively, then catching\nherself and, with a worried look, glancing around to see if she had been overheard.\n“… and then it became really sunny and I walked off and it poured right after I left. It\npoured but we have something amazing because—honestly it looked like a million,\nmillion and a half people, whatever it was it was, but it went all the way back to the\nWashington Monument and by mistake I get this network and it showed an empty field\nand it said we drew two hundred fifty thousand people. Now that’s not bad, but it’s a lie…\n. And we had another one yesterday which was interesting. In the Oval Office there’s a\nbeautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King and I also happen to like Churchill—Winston\nChurchill—I think most of us like Churchill, doesn’t come from our country but had a lot\nto do with it, helped us, real ally, and as you know the Churchill statue was taken out… .\nSo a reporter for Time magazine and I have been on the cover like fourteen or fifteen\ntimes. I think I have the all-time record in the history of Time magazine. Like if Tom\nBrady is on the cover it’s one time because he won the Super Bowl or something. I’ve\nbeen on fifteen times this year. I don’t think, Mike, that’s a record that can ever be broken,\ndo you agree with that … . What do you think?”\n“No,” said Pompeo in a stricken voice.\n“But I will say that they said it was very interesting that ‘Donald Trump took down the\nbust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King,’ and it was right there, there was a cameraman\nthat was in front of it. So Zeke … Zeke … from Time magazine … writes a story that I\ntook it down. I would never do that. I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. But\nthis is how dishonest the media is. Now big story, but the retraction was like this”—he\nindicated ever-so-small with his fingers. “Is it a line or do they even bother putting it in? I\nonly like to say I love honesty, I like honest reporting. I will tell you, final time, although I\nwill say it when you let in your thousands of other people who have been trying to come\nin, because I am coming back, we may have to get you a larger room, we may have to get\nyou a larger room and maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to\nbuild and we won’t have columns. You understand that? We get rid of the columns, but\nyou know I just wanted to say that I love you, I respect you, there’s nobody I respect more.\nYou do a fantastic job and we’re going to start winning again, and you’re going to be\nleading the charge, so thank you all very much.”\nIn a continuing sign of Trump’s Rashomon effect—his speeches inspiring joy or horror\n—witnesses would describe his reception at the CIA as either a Beatles-like emotional\noutpouring or a response so confounded and appalled that, in the seconds after he finished,\nyou could hear a pin drop.\n4\nBANNON\nS\nteve Bannon was the first Trump senior staffer in the White House after Trump was\nsworn in. On the inauguration march, he had grabbed the newly appointed deputy\nchief of staff, Katie Walsh, Reince Priebus’s deputy at the RNC, and together they had\npeeled off to inspect the now vacant West Wing. The carpet had been shampooed, but little\nelse had changed. It was a warren of tiny offices in need of paint, not rigorously cleaned\non a regular basis, the décor something like an admissions office at a public university.\nBannon claimed the nondescript office across from the much grander chief of staff’s suite,\nand he immediately requisitioned the white boards on which he intended to chart the first\nhundred days of the Trump administration. And right away he began moving furniture out.\nThe point was to leave no room for anyone to sit. There were to be no meetings, at least no\nmeetings where people could get comfortable. Limit discussion. Limit debate. This was\nwar. This was a war room.\nMany who had worked with Bannon on the campaign and through the transition\nshortly noticed a certain change. Having achieved one goal, he was clearly on to another.\nAn intense man, he was suddenly at an even higher level of focus and determination.\n“What’s up with Steve?” Kushner began to ask. And then, “Is something wrong with\nSteve?” And then finally, “I don’t understand. We were so close.”\nWithin the first week, Bannon seemed to have put away the camaraderie of Trump\nTower—including a willingness to talk at length at any hour—and become far more\nremote, if not unreachable. He was “focused on my shit.” He was just getting things done.\nBut many felt that getting things done was was more about him hatching plots against\nthem. And certainly, among his basic character notes, Steve Bannon was a plotter. Strike\nbefore being struck. Anticipate the moves of others—counter them before they can make\ntheir moves. To him this was seeing things ahead, focusing on a set of goals. The first goal\nwas the election of Donald Trump, the second the staffing of the Trump government. Now\nit was capturing the soul of the Trump White House, and he understood what others did\nnot yet: this would be a mortal competition.\n* * *\nIn the early days of the transition, Bannon had encouraged the Trump team to read David\nHalberstam’s The Best and the Brightest. (One of the few people who seem actually to\nhave taken him up on this reading assignment was Jared Kushner.) “A very moving\nexperience reading this book. It makes the world clear, amazing characters and all true,”\nBannon enthused.\nThis was a personal bit of branding—Bannon made sure to exhibit the book to many of\nthe liberal reporters he was courting. But he was also trying to make a point, an important\none considering the slapdash nature of the transition team’s staffing protocols: be careful\nwho you hire.\nHalberstam’s book, published in 1972, is a Tolstoyan effort to understand how great\nfigures of the academic, intellectual, and military world who had served during the\nKennedy and Johnson years had so grievously misapprehended the nature of the Vietnam\nWar and mishandled its prosecution. The Best and the Brightest was a cautionary tale\nabout the 1960s establishment—the precursor of the establishment that Trump and\nBannon were now so aggressively challenging.\nBut the book also served as a reverential guide to the establishment. For the 1970s\ngeneration of future policy experts, would-be world leaders, and Ivy League journalists\naiming for big-time careers—though it was Bannon’s generation, he was far outside this\nself-selected elite circle—The Best and the Brightest was a handbook about the\ncharacteristics of American power and the routes to it. Not just the right schools and right\nbackgrounds, although that, too, but the attitudes, conceits, affect, and language that would\nbe most conducive to finding your way into the American power structure. Many saw the\nbook as a set of prescriptions about how to get ahead, rather than, as intended, what not to\ndo when you are ahead. The Best and the Brightest described the people who should be in\npower. A college-age Barack Obama was smitten with the book, as was Rhodes Scholar\nBill Clinton.\nHalberstam’s book defined the look and feel of White House power. His language,\nresonant and imposing and, often, boffo pompous, had set the tone for the next half\ncentury of official presidential journalism. Even scandalous or unsuccessful tenants of the\nWhite House were treated as unique figures who had risen to the greatest heights after\nmastering a Darwinian political process. Bob Woodward, who helped bring Nixon down\n—and who himself became a figure of unchallengeable presidential mythmaking—wrote a\nlong shelf of books in which even the most misguided presidential actions seemed part of\nan epochal march of ultimate responsibility and life-and-death decision making. Only the\nmost hardhearted reader would not entertain a daydream in which he or she was not part\nof this awesome pageant.\nSteve Bannon was such a daydreamer.\n* * *\nBut if Halberstam defined the presidential mien, Trump defied it—and defiled it. Not a\nsingle attribute would place him credibly in the revered circle of American presidential\ncharacter and power. Which was, in a curious reversal of the book’s premise, just what\ncreated Steve Bannon’s opportunity.\nThe less likely a presidential candidate is, the more unlikely, and, often, inexperienced,\nhis aides are—that is, an unlikely candidate can attract only unlikely aides, as the likely\nones go to the more likely candidates. When an unlikely candidate wins—and as outsiders\nbecome ever more the quadrennial flavor of the month, the more likely an unlikely\ncandidate is to get elected—ever more peculiar people fill the White House. Of course, a\npoint about the Halberstam book and about the Trump campaign was that the most\nobvious players make grievous mistakes, too. Hence, in the Trump narrative, unlikely\nplayers far outside the establishment hold the true genius.\nStill, few have been more unlikely than Steve Bannon.\nAt sixty-three, Bannon took his first formal job in politics when he joined the Trump\ncampaign. Chief Strategist—his title in the new administration—was his first job not just\nin the federal government but in the public sector. (“Strategist!” scoffed Roger Stone,\nwho, before Bannon, had been one of Trump’s chief strategists.) Other than Trump\nhimself, Bannon was certainly the oldest inexperienced person ever to work in the White\nHouse.\nIt was a flaky career that got him here.\nCatholic school in Richmond, Virginia. Then a local college, Virginia Tech. Then seven\nyears in the Navy, a lieutenant on ship duty and then in the Pentagon. While on active\nduty, he got a master’s degree at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service, but then he\nwashed out of his naval career. Then an MBA from Harvard Business School. Then four\nyears as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs—his final two years focusing on the\nmedia industry in Los Angeles—but not rising above a midlevel position.\nIn 1990, at the age of thirty-seven, Bannon entered peripatetic entre-preneurhood under\nthe auspices of Bannon & Co., a financial advisory firm to the entertainment industry. This\nwas something of a hustler’s shell company, hanging out a shingle in an industry with a\nsmall center of success and concentric rings radiating out of rising, aspiring, falling, and\nfailing strivers. Bannon & Co., skirting falling and failing, made it to aspiring by raising\nsmall amounts of money for independent film projects—none a hit.\nBannon was rather a movie figure himself. A type. Alcohol. Bad marriages. Cashstrapped\nin a business where the measure of success is excesses of riches. Ever scheming.\nEver disappointed.\nFor a man with a strong sense of his own destiny, he tended to be hardly noticed. Jon\nCorzine, the former Goldman chief and future United States senator and governor of New\nJersey, climbing the Goldman ranks when Bannon was at the firm, was unaware of\nBannon. When Bannon was appointed head of the Trump campaign and became an\novernight press sensation—or question mark—his credentials suddenly included a\nconvoluted story about how Bannon & Co. had acquired a stake in the megahit show\nSeinfeld and hence its twenty-year run of residual profits. But none of the Seinfeld\nprincipals, creators, or producers seem ever to have heard of him.\nMike Murphy, the Republican media consultant who ran Jeb Bush’s PAC and became a\nleading anti-Trump movement figure, has the vaguest recollection of Bannon’s seeking PR\nservices from Murphy’s firm for a film Bannon was producing a decade or so ago. “I’m\ntold he was in the meeting, but I honestly can’t get a picture of him.”\nThe New Yorker magazine, dwelling on the Bannon enigma—one that basically\ntranslated to: How is it that the media has been almost wholly unaware of someone who is\nsuddenly among the most powerful people in government?—tried to trace his steps in\nHollywood and largely failed to find him. The Washington Post traced his many addresses\nto no clear conclusion, except a suggestion of possible misdemeanor voter fraud.\nIn the midnineties, he inserted himself in a significant role into Biosphere 2, a project\ncopiously funded by Edward Bass, one of the Bass family oil heirs, about sustaining life in\nspace, and dubbed by Time one of the hundred worst ideas of the century—a rich man’s\nfolly. Bannon, having to find his opportunities in distress situations, stepped into the\nproject amid its collapse only to provoke further breakdown and litigation, including\nharassment and vandalism charges.\nAfter the Biosphere 2 disaster, he participated in raising financing for a virtual currency\nscheme (MMORPGs, or MMOs) called Internet Gaming Entertainment (IGE). This was a\nsuccessor company to Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), a dot-com burnout, whose\nprincipals included the former child star Brock Pierce (The Mighty Ducks) who went on to\nbe the founder of IGE, but was then pushed out. Bannon was put in as CEO, and the\ncompany was subsumed by endless litigation.\nDistress is an opportunistic business play. But some distress is better than others. The\nkinds of situations available to Bannon involved managing conflict, nastiness, and relative\nhopelessness—in essence managing and taking a small profit on dwindling cash. It’s a\nliving at the margins of people who are making a much better living. Bannon kept trying\nto make a killing but never found the killing sweet spot.\nDistress is also a contrarian’s game. And the contrarian’s impulse—equal parts\npersonal dissatisfaction, general resentment, and gambler’s instinct—started to ever more\nstrongly fuel Bannon. Part of the background for his contrarian impulse lay in an Irish\nCatholic union family, Catholic schools, and three unhappy marriages and bad divorces\n(journalists would make much of the recriminations in his second wife’s divorce filings).\nNot so long ago, Bannon might have been a recognizably modern figure, something of\na romantic antihero, an ex-military and up-from-the-working-class guy, striving, through\nmultiple marriages and various careers, to make it, but never finding much comfort in the\nestablishment world, wanting to be part of it and wanting to blow it up at the same time—\na character for Richard Ford, or John Updike, or Harry Crews. An American man’s story.\nBut now such stories have crossed a political line. The American man story is a right-wing\nstory. Bannon found his models in political infighters like Lee Atwater, Roger Ailes, Karl\nRove. All were larger-than-life American characters doing battle with conformity and\nmodernity, relishing ways to violate liberal sensibilities.\nThe other point is that Bannon, however smart and even charismatic, however much he\nextolled the virtue of being a “stand-up guy,” was not necessarily a nice guy. Several\ndecades as a grasping entrepreneur without a satisfying success story doesn’t smooth the\nhustle in hustler. One competitor in the conservative media business, while acknowledging\nhis intelligence and the ambitiousness of his ideas, also noted, “He’s mean, dishonest, and\nincapable of caring about other people. His eyes dart around like he’s always looking for a\nweapon with which to bludgeon or gouge you.”\nConservative media fit not only his angry, contrarian, and Roman Catholic side, but it\nhad low barriers to entry—liberal media, by contrast, with its corporate hierarchies, was\nmuch harder to break into. What’s more, conservative media is a highly lucrative target\nmarket category, with books (often dominating the bestseller lists), videos, and other\nproducts available through direct sales avenues that can circumvent more expensive\ndistribution channels.\nIn the early 2000s, Bannon became a purveyor of conservative books products and\nmedia. His partner in this enterprise was David Bossie, the far-right pamphleteer and\ncongressional committee investigator into the Clintons’ Whitewater affair, who would join\nhim as deputy campaign manager on the Trump campaign. Bannon met Breitbart News\nfounder Andrew Breitbart at a screening of one of the Bannon-Bossie documentaries In\nthe Face of Evil (billed as “Ronald Reagan’s crusade to destroy the most tyrannical and\ndepraved political systems the world has ever known”), which in turn led to a relationship\nwith the man who offered Bannon the ultimate opportunity: Robert Mercer.\n* * *\nIn this regard, Bannon was not so much an entrepreneur of vision or even business\ndiscipline, he was more simply following the money—or trying to separate a fool from his\nmoney. He could not have done better than Bob and Rebekah Mercer. Bannon focused his\nentrepreneurial talents on becoming courtier, Svengali, and political investment adviser to\nfather and daughter.\nTheirs was a consciously quixotic mission. They would devote vast sums—albeit still\njust a small part of Bob Mercer’s many billions—to trying to build a radical free-market,\nsmall-government, home-schooling, antiliberal, gold-standard, pro-death-penalty, anti-\nMuslim, pro-Christian, monetarist, anti-civil-rights political movement in the United\nStates.\nBob Mercer is an ultimate quant, an engineer who designs investment algorithms and\nbecame a co-CEO of one of the most successful hedge funds, Renaissance Technologies.\nWith his daughter, Rebekah, Mercer set up what is in effect a private Tea Party movement,\nself-funding whatever Tea Party or alt-right project took their fancy. Bob Mercer is almost\nnonverbal, looking at you with a dead stare and either not talking or offering only minimal\nresponse. He had a Steinway baby grand on his yacht; after inviting friends and colleagues\non the boat, he would spend the time playing the piano, wholly disengaged from his\nguests. And yet his political beliefs, to the extent they could be discerned, were generally\nBush-like, and his political discussions, to the extent that you could get him to be\nresponsive, were about issues involving ground game and data gathering. It was Rebekah\nMercer—who had bonded with Bannon, and whose politics were grim, unyielding, and\ndoctrinaire—who defined the family. “She’s … like whoa, ideologically there is no\nconversation with her,” said one senior Trump White House staffer.\nWith the death of Andrew Breitbart in 2012, Bannon, in essence holding the proxy of\nthe Mercers’ investment in the site, took over the Breitbart business. He leveraged his\ngaming experience into using Gamergate—a precursor alt-right movement that coalesced\naround an antipathy toward, and harassment of, women working in the online gaming\nindustry—to build vast amounts of traffic through the virality of political memes. (After\nhours one night in the White House, Bannon would argue that he knew exactly how to\nbuild a Breitbart for the left. And he would have the key advantage because “people on the\nleft want to win Pulitzers, whereas I want to be Pulitzer!”)\nWorking out of—and living in—the town house Breitbart rented on Capitol Hill,\nBannon became one of the growing number of notable Tea Party figures in Washington,\nthe Mercers’ consigliere. But a seeming measure of his marginality was that his big project\nwas the career of Jeff Sessions—“Beauregard,” Sessions’s middle name, in Bannon’s\naffectionate moniker and evocation of the Confederate general—among the least\nmainstream and most peculiar people in the Senate, whom Bannon tried to promote to run\nfor president in 2012.\nDonald Trump was a step up—and early in the 2016 race, Trump became the Breitbart\ntotem. (Many of Trump’s positions in the campaign were taken from the Breitbart articles\nhe had printed out for him.) Indeed, Bannon began to suggest to people that he, like Ailes\nhad been at Fox, was the true force behind his chosen candidate.\nBannon didn’t much question Donald Trump’s bona fides, or behavior, or electability,\nbecause, in part, Trump was just his latest rich man. The rich man is a fixed fact, which\nyou have to accept and deal with in an entrepreneurial world—at least a lower-level\nentrepreneurial world. And, of course, if Trump had had firmer bona fides, better behavior,\nand clear electability, Bannon would not have had his chance.\nHowever much a marginal, invisible, small-time hustler Bannon had been—something\nof an Elmore Leonard character—he was suddenly transformed inside Trump Tower, an\noffice he entered on August 15, and for practical purposes, did not exit, save for a few\nhours a night (and not every night) in his temporary midtown Manhattan accommodations,\nuntil January 17, when the transition team moved to Washington. There was no\ncompetition in Trump Tower for being the brains of the operation. Of the dominant figures\nin the transition, neither Kushner, Priebus, nor Conway, and certainly not the presidentelect,\nhad the ability to express any kind of coherent perception or narrative. By default,\neverybody had to look to the voluble, aphoristic, shambolic, witty, off-the-cuff figure who\nwas both ever present on the premises and who had, in an unlikely attribute, read a book\nor two.\nAnd indeed who, during the campaign, turned out to be able to harness the Trump\noperation, not to mention its philosophic disarray, to a single political view: that the path\nto victory was an economic and cultural message to the white working class in Florida,\nOhio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.\n* * *\nBannon collected enemies. Few fueled his savagery and rancor toward the standard-issue\nRepublican world as much as Rupert Murdoch—not least because Murdoch had Donald\nTrump’s ear. It was one of the key elements of Bannon’s understanding of Trump: the last\nperson Trump spoke to ended up with enormous influence. Trump would brag that\nMurdoch was always calling him; Murdoch, for his part, would complain that he couldn’t\nget Trump off the phone.\n“He doesn’t know anything about American politics, and has no feel for the American\npeople,” said Bannon to Trump, always eager to point out that Murdoch wasn’t an\nAmerican. But Trump couldn’t get enough of him. With his love of “winners”—and he\nsaw Murdoch as the ultimate winner—Trump was suddenly bad-mouthing his friend Ailes\nas a “loser.”\nAnd yet in one regard Murdoch’s message was useful to Bannon. Having known every\npresident since Harry Truman—as Murdoch took frequent opportunities to point out—\nand, he conjectured, as many heads of state as anyone living, Murdoch believed he\nunderstood better than younger men, even seventy-year-old Trump, that political power\nwas fleeting. (This was in fact the same message he had imparted to Barack Obama.) A\npresident really had only, max, six months to make an impact on the public and set his\nagenda, and he’d be lucky to get six months. After that it was just putting out fires and\nbattling the opposition.\nThis was the message whose urgency Bannon himself had been trying to impress on an\noften distracted Trump. Indeed, in his first weeks in the White House, an inattentive\nTrump was already trying to curtail his schedule of meetings, limit his hours in the office,\nand keep his normal golf habits.\nBannon’s strategic view of government was shock and awe. Dominate rather than\nnegotiate. Having daydreamed his way into ultimate bureaucratic power, he did not want\nto see himself as a bureaucrat. He was of a higher purpose and moral order. He was an\navenger. He was also, he believed, a straight shooter. There was a moral order in aligning\nlanguage and action—if you said you were going to do something, you do it.\nIn his head, Bannon carried a set of decisive actions that would not just mark the new\nadministration’s opening days, but make it clear that nothing ever again would be the\nsame. At the age of sixty-three, he was in a hurry.\n* * *\nBannon had delved deeply into the nature of executive orders—EOs. You can’t rule by\ndecree in the United States, except you really can. The irony here was that it was the\nObama administration, with a recalcitrant Republican Congress, that had pushed the EO\nenvelope. Now, in something of a zero-sum game, Trump’s EOs would undo Obama’s\nEOs.\nDuring the transition, Bannon and Stephen Miller, a former Sessions aide who had\nearlier joined the Trump campaign and then become Bannon’s effective assistant and\nresearcher, assembled a list of more than two hundred EOs to issue in the first hundred\ndays.\nBut the first step in the new Trump administration had to be immigration, in Bannon’s\ncertain view. Foreigners were the ne plus ultra mania of Trumpism. An issue often\ndismissed as living on the one-track-mind fringe—Jeff Sessions was one of its cranky\nexponents—it was Trump’s firm belief that a lot of people had had it up to here with\nforeigners. Before Trump, Bannon had bonded with Sessions on the issue. The Trump\ncampaign became a sudden opportunity to see if nativism really had legs. And then when\nthey won, Bannon understood there could be no hesitation about declaring their\nethnocentric heart and soul.\nTo boot, it was an issue that made liberals bat-shit mad.\nLaxly enforced immigration laws reached to the center of the new liberal philosophy\nand, for Bannon, exposed its hypocrisy. In the liberal worldview, diversity was an absolute\ngood, whereas Bannon believed any reasonable person who was not wholly blinded by the\nliberal light could see that waves of immigrants came with a load of problems—just look\nat Europe. And these were problems borne not by cosseted liberals but by the more\nexposed citizens at the other end of the economic scale.\nIt was out of some instinctive or idiot-savant-like political understanding that Trump\nhad made this issue his own, frequently observing, Wasn’t anybody an American\nanymore? In some of his earliest political outings, even before Obama’s election in 2008,\nTrump talked with bewilderment and resentment about strict quotas on European\nimmigration and the deluge from “Asia and other places.” (This deluge, as liberals would\nbe quick to fact-check, was, even as it had grown, still quite a modest stream.) His\nobsessive focus on Obama’s birth certificate was in part about the scourge of non-\nEuropean foreignness—a certain race-baiting. Who were these people? Why were they\nhere?\nThe campaign sometimes shared a striking graphic. It showed a map of the country\nreflecting dominant immigration trends in each state from fifty years ago—here was a\nmultitude of countries, many European. Today, the equivalent map showed that every state\nin the United States was now dominated by Mexican immigration. This was the daily\nreality of the American workingman, in Bannon’s view, the ever growing presence of an\nalternative, discount workforce.\nBannon’s entire political career, such as it was, had been in political media. It was also\nin Internet media—that is, media ruled by immediate response. The Breitbart formula was\nto so appall the liberals that the base was doubly satisfied, generating clicks in a ricochet\nof disgust and delight. You defined yourself by your enemy’s reaction. Conflict was the\nmedia bait—hence, now, the political chum. The new politics was not the art of the\ncompromise but the art of conflict.\nThe real goal was to expose the hypocrisy of the liberal view. Somehow, despite laws,\nrules, and customs, liberal globalists had pushed a myth of more or less open immigration.\nIt was a double liberal hypocrisy, because, sotto voce, the Obama administration had been\nquite aggressive in deporting illegal aliens—except don’t tell the liberals that.\n“People want their countries back,” said Bannon. “A simple thing.”\n* * *\nBannon meant his EO to strip away the liberal conceits on an already illiberal process.\nRather than seeking to accomplish his goals with the least amount of upset—keeping\nliberal fig leaves in place—he sought the most.\nWhy would you? was the logical question of anyone who saw the higher function of\ngovernment as avoiding conflict.\nThis included most people in office. The new appointees in place at the affected\nagencies and departments, among them Homeland Security and State—General John\nKelly, then the director of Homeland Security, would carry a grudge about the disarray\ncaused by the immigration EO—wanted nothing more than a moment to get their footing\nbefore they might even consider dramatic and contentious new policies. Old appointees—\nObama appointees who still occupied most executive branch jobs—found it unfathomable\nthat the new administration would go out of its way to take procedures that largely already\nexisted and to restate them in incendiary, red-flag, and ad hominem terms, such that\nliberals would have to oppose them.\nBannon’s mission was to puncture the global-liberal-emperor-wears-no-clothes bubble,\nnowhere, in his view, as ludicrously demonstrated as the refusal to see the colossally\ndifficult and costly effects of uncontrolled immigration. He wanted to force liberals to\nacknowledge that even liberal governments, even the Obama government, were engaged\nin the real politics of slowing immigration—ever hampered by the liberal refusal to\nacknowledge this effort.\nThe EO would be drafted to remorselessly express the administration’s (or Bannon’s)\npitiless view. The problem was, Bannon really didn’t know how to do this—change rules\nand laws. This limitation, Bannon understood, might easily be used to thwart them.\nProcess was their enemy. But just doing it—the hell with how—and doing it immediately,\ncould be a powerful countermeasure.\nJust doing things became a Bannon principle, the sweeping antidote to bureaucratic\nand establishment ennui and resistance. It was the chaos of just doing things that actually\ngot things done. Except, even if you assumed that not knowing how to do things didn’t\nmuch matter if you just did them, it was still not clear who was going to do what you\nwanted to do. Or, a corollary, because nobody in the Trump administration really knew\nhow to do anything, it was therefore not clear what anyone did.\nSean Spicer, whose job was literally to explain what people did and why, often simply\ncould not—because nobody really had a job, because nobody could do a job.\nPriebus, as chief of staff, had to organize meetings, schedules, and the hiring of staff;\nhe also had to oversee the individual functions of the executive office departments. But\nBannon, Kushner, Conway, and the president’s daughter actually had no specific\nresponsibilities—they could make it up as they went along. They did what they wanted.\nThey would seize the day if they could—even if they really didn’t know how to do what\nthey wanted to do.\nBannon, for instance, even driven by his imperative just to get things done, did not use\na computer. How did he do anything? Katie Walsh wondered. But that was the difference\nbetween big visions and small. Process was bunk. Expertise was the last refuge of liberals,\never defeated by the big picture. The will to get big things done was how big things got\ndone. “Don’t sweat the small stuff” was a pretty good gist of Donald Trump’s—and Steve\nBannon’s—worldview. “Chaos was Steve’s strategy,” said Walsh.\nBannon got Stephen Miller to write the immigration EO. Miller, a fifty-five-year-old\ntrapped in a thirty-two-year-old’s body, was a former Jeff Sessions staffer brought on to\nthe Trump campaign for his political experience. Except, other than being a dedicated farright\nconservative, it was unclear what particular abilities accompanied Miller’s political\nviews. He was supposed to be a speechwriter, but if so, he seemed restricted to bullet\npoints and unable to construct sentences. He was supposed to be a policy adviser but knew\nlittle about policy. He was supposed to be the house intellectual but was purposely unread.\nHe was supposed to be a communications specialist, but he antagonized almost everyone.\nBannon, during the transition, sent him to the Internet to learn about and to try to draft the\nEO.\nBy the time he arrived in the White House, Bannon had his back-of-the-envelope\nexecutive order on immigration and his travel ban, a sweeping, Trumpian exclusion of\nmost Muslims from the United States, only begrudgingly whittled down, in part at\nPriebus’s urging, to what would shortly be perceived as merely draconian.\nIn the mania to seize the day, with an almost total lack of knowing how, the nutty\ninaugural crowd numbers and the wacky CIA speech were followed, without almost\nanybody in the federal government having seen it or even being aware of it, by an\nexecutive order overhauling U.S. immigration policy. Bypassing lawyers, regulators, and\nthe agencies and personnel responsible for enforcing it, President Trump—with Bannon’s\nlow, intense voice behind him, offering a rush of complex information—signed what was\nput in front of him.\nOn Friday, January 27, the travel ban was signed and took immediate effect. The result\nwas an emotional outpouring of horror and indignation from liberal media, terror in\nimmigrant communities, tumultuous protests at major airports, confusion throughout the\ngovernment, and, in the White House, an inundation of lectures, warnings, and\nopprobrium from friends and family. What have you done? Do you know what you’re\ndoing? You have to undo this! You’re finished before you even start! Who is in charge\nthere?\nBut Steve Bannon was satisfied. He could not have hoped to draw a more vivid line\nbetween the two Americas—Trump’s and liberals’—and between his White House and the\nWhite House inhabited by those not yet ready to burn the place down.\nWhy did we do this on a Friday when it would hit the airports hardest and bring out the\nmost protesters? almost the entire White House staff demanded to know.\n“Errr … that’s why,” said Bannon. “So the snowflakes would show up at the airports\nand riot.” That was the way to crush the liberals: make them crazy and drag them to the\nleft.\n5\nJARVANKA\nO\nn the Sunday after the immigration order was issued, Joe Scarborough and his cohost\non the MSNBC show Morning Joe, Mika Brzezinski, came for lunch at the White\nHouse.\nScarborough is a former Republican congressman from Pensacola, Florida, and\nBrzezinski is the daughter of Zbigniew Brzezinski, a high-ranking aide in the Johnson\nWhite House and Jimmy Carter’s National Security Advisor. Morning Joe had gone on the\nair in 2007 and developed a following among New York political and media types. Trump\nwas a longtime devotee.\nEarly in the 2016 campaign, with a change of leadership at NBC News, it seemed\nlikely that the show, its ratings falling, would be canceled. But Scarborough and\nBrzezinski embraced their relationship with Trump and became one of the few media\noutlets not only with a positive outlook on him, but that seemed to know his thinking.\nTrump became a frequent call-in guest and the show a way to speak more or less directly\nto him.\nIt was the kind of relationship Trump dreamed of: media people who took him\nseriously, talked about him often, solicited his views, provided him with gossip, and\nretailed the gossip he offered them. The effect was to make them all insiders together,\nwhich was exactly where Trump wanted to be. Though he branded himself as a political\noutsider, actually finding himself on the outside wounded him.\nTrump believed that the media, which he propelled (in the case of Scarborough and\nBrzezinski, helping them keep their jobs), owed him something, and the media, giving him\nvast amounts of free coverage, believed he owed them, with Scarborough and Brzezinski\nseeing themselves as something like semiofficial advisers, if not the political fixers who\nhad put him in his job.\nIn August, they had had a public spat, resulting in Trump’s tweet: “Some day, when\nthings calm down, I’ll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time\ngirlfriend, @morningmika. Two clowns!” But Trump’s spats often ended in a tacit\nadmission, however grudging, of mutual advantage, and in short order they were back on\ncordial terms again.\nOn their arrival at the White House, the ninth day of his presidency, Trump proudly\nshowed them into the Oval Office and was momentarily deflated when Brzezinski said she\nhad been there many times before with her father, beginning at age nine. Trump showed\nthem some of the memorabilia and, eagerly, his new portrait of Andrew Jackson—the\npresident whom Steve Bannon had made the totem figure of the new administration.\n“So how do you think the first week has gone?” Trump asked the couple, in a buoyant\nmood, seeking flattery.\nScarborough, puzzled by Trump’s jauntiness in the face of the protests spreading across\nthe nation, demurred and then said, “Well, I love what you did with U.S. Steel and that\nyou had the union guys come into the Oval Office.” Trump had pledged to use U.S.-made\nsteel in U.S. pipelines and, in a Trump touch, met at the White House with union\nrepresentatives from building and sheet metal unions and then invited them back to the\nOval Office—something Trump insisted Obama never did.\nBut Trump pressed his question, leaving Scarborough with the feeling that nobody had\nactually told Trump that he had had a very bad week. Bannon and Priebus, wandering in\nand out of the office, might actually have convinced him that the week had been a success,\nScarborough thought.\nScarborough then ventured his opinion that the immigration order might have been\nhandled better and that, all in all, it seemed like a rough period.\nTrump, surprised, plunged into a long monologue about how well things had gone,\ntelling Bannon and Priebus, with a gale of laughter, “Joe doesn’t think we had a good\nweek.” And turning to Scarborough: “I could have invited Hannity!”\nAt lunch—fish, which Brzezinski doesn’t eat—Jared and Ivanka joined the president\nand Scarborough and Brzezinski. Jared had become quite a Scarborough confidant and\nwould continue to supply Scarborough with an inside view of the White House—that is,\nleaking to him. Scarborough subsequently became a defender of Kushner’s White House\nposition and view. But, for now, both son-in-law and daughter were subdued and\ndeferential as Scarborough and Brzezinski chatted with the president, and the president—\ntaking more of the air time as usual—held forth.\nTrump continued to cast for positive impressions of his first week and Scarborough\nagain reverted to his praise of Trump’s handling of the steel union leadership. At which\npoint, Jared interjected that reaching out to unions, a traditional Democratic constituency,\nwas Bannon’s doing, that this was “the Bannon way.”\n“Bannon?” said the president, jumping on his son-in-law. “That wasn’t Bannon’s idea.\nThat was my idea. It’s the Trump way, not the Bannon way.”\nKushner, going concave, retreated from the discussion.\nTrump, changing the topic, said to Scarborough and Brzezinski, “So what about you\nguys? What’s going on?” He was referencing their not-so-secret secret relationship.\nScarborough and Brzezinski said it was all still complicated, and not public, officially,\nbut it was good and everything was getting resolved.\n“You guys should just get married,” prodded Trump.\n“I can marry you! I’m an Internet Unitarian minister,” Kushner, otherwise an Orthodox\nJew, said suddenly.\n“What?” said the president. “What are you talking about? Why would they want you to\nmarry them when I could marry them? When they could be married by the president! At\nMar-a-Lago!”\n* * *\nAlmost everybody advised Jared not to take the inside job. As a family member, he would\ncommand extraordinary influence from a position that no one could challenge. As an\ninsider, a staffer, not only could his experience be challenged, but while the president\nhimself might not yet be exposed, a family member on staff would be where enemies and\ncritics might quite effectively start chipping from. Besides, inside Trump’s West Wing, if\nyou had a title—that is, other than son-in-law—people would surely want to take it from\nyou.\nBoth Jared and Ivanka listened to this advice—from among others it came from Jared’s\nbrother, Josh, doubly making this case not only to protect his brother but also because of\nhis antipathy to Trump—but both, balancing risk against reward, ignored it. Trump\nhimself variously encouraged his son-in-law and his daughter in their new ambitions and,\nas their excitement mounted, tried to express his skepticism—while at the same time\ntelling others that he was helpless to stop them.\nFor Jared and Ivanka, as really for everybody else in the new administration, quite\nincluding the president, this was a random and crazy turn of history such that how could\nyou not seize it? It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. Jared\nand Ivanka had made an earnest deal between themselves: if sometime in the future the\ntime came, she’d be the one to run for president (or the first one of them to take the shot).\nThe first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton, it would be\nIvanka Trump.\nBannon, who had coined the Jarvanka conflation now in ever greater use, was horrified\nwhen the couple’s deal was reported to him. “They didn’t say that? Stop. Oh come on.\nThey didn’t actually say that? Please don’t tell me that. Oh my god.”\nAnd the truth was that at least by then Ivanka would have more experience than almost\nanybody else now serving in the White House. She and Jared, or Jared, but by inference\nshe, too, were in effect the real chief of staff—or certainly as much a chief of staff as\nPriebus or Bannon, all of them reporting directly to the president. Or, even more to the\norganizational point, Jared and Ivanka had a wholly independent standing inside the West\nWing. A super status. Even as Priebus and Bannon tried, however diplomatically, to\nremind the couple of staff procedures and propriety, they would in turn remind the West\nWing leadership of their overriding First Family prerogatives. In addition, the president\nhad immediately handed Jared the Middle East portfolio, making him one of the\nsignificant international players in the administration—indeed, in the world. In the first\nweeks, this brief extended out to virtually every other international issue, about which\nnothing in Kushner’s previous background would have prepared him for.\nKushner’s most cogent reason for entering the White House was “leverage,” by which\nhe meant proximity. Quite beyond the status of being inside the family circle, anyone who\nhad proximity to the president had leverage, the more proximity the more leverage. Trump\nhimself you could see as a sort of Delphic oracle, sitting in place and throwing out\npronouncements which had to be interpreted. Or as an energetic child, and whomever\ncould placate or distract him became his favorite. Or as the Sun God (which is effectively\nhow he saw himself), the absolute center of attention, dispensing favor and delegating\npower, which could, at any moment, be withdrawn. The added dimension was that this\nSun God had little calculation. His inspiration existed in the moment, hence all the more\nreason to be there with him in the moment. Bannon, for one, joined Trump for dinner\nevery night, or at least made himself available—one bachelor there for the effective other\nbachelor. (Priebus would observe that in the beginning everyone would try to be part of\nthese dinners, but within a few months, they had become a torturous duty to be avoided.)\nPart of Jared and Ivanka’s calculation about the relative power and influence of a\nformal job in the West Wing versus an outside advisory role was the knowledge that\ninfluencing Trump required you to be all in. From phone call to phone call—and his day,\nbeyond organized meetings, was almost entirely phone calls—you could lose him. The\nsubtleties here were immense, because while he was often most influenced by the last\nperson he spoke to, he did not actually listen to anyone. So it was not so much the force of\nan individual argument or petition that moved him, but rather more just someone’s\npresence, the connection of what was going through his mind—and although he was a\nperson of many obsessions, much of what was on his mind had no fixed view—to\nwhomever he was with and their views.\nUltimately Trump may not be that different in his fundamental solipsism from anyone\nof great wealth who has lived most of his life in a highly controlled environment. But one\nclear difference was that he had acquired almost no formal sort of social discipline—he\ncould not even attempt to imitate decorum. He could not really converse, for instance, not\nin the sense of sharing information, or of a balanced back-and-forth conversation. He\nneither particularly listened to what was said to him, nor particularly considered what he\nsaid in response (one reason he was so repetitive). Nor did he treat anyone with any sort of\nbasic or reliable courtesy. If he wanted something, his focus might be sharp and attention\nlavish, but if someone wanted something from him, he tended to become irritable and\nquickly lost interest. He demanded you pay him attention, then decided you were weak for\ngroveling. In a sense, he was like an instinctive, pampered, and hugely successful actor.\nEverybody was either a lackey who did his bidding or a high-ranking film functionary\ntrying to coax out his attention and performance—and to do this without making him\nangry or petulant.\nThe payoff was his enthusiasm, quickness, spontaneity, and—if he departed for a\nmoment from the nonstop focus on himself—an often incisive sense of the weaknesses of\nhis opponents and a sense of their deepest desires. Politics was handicapped by\nincrementalism, of people knowing too much who were defeated by all the complexities\nand conflicting interests before they began. Trump, knowing little, might, Trumpers tried\nto believe, give a kooky new hope to the system.\nJared Kushner in quite a short period of time—rather less than a year—had crossed\nover from the standard Democratic view in which he was raised, to an acolyte of\nTrumpism, bewildering many friends and, as well, his own brother, whose insurance\ncompany, Oscar, funded with Kushner-family money, was destined to be dealt a blow by a\nrepeal of Obamacare.\nThis seeming conversion was partly the result of Bannon’s insistent and charismatic\ntutoring—a kind of real-life engagement with world-bending ideas that had escaped\nKushner even at Harvard. And it was helped by his own resentments toward the liberal\nelites whom he had tried to court with his purchase of the New York Observer, an effort\nthat had backfired terribly. And it was, once he ventured onto the campaign trail, about\nhaving to convince himself that close up to the absurd everything made sense—that\nTrumpism was a kind of unsentimental realpolitik that would show everybody in the end.\nBut most of all, it was that they had won. And he was determined not to look a gift horse\nin the mouth. And, everything that was bad about Trumpism, he had convinced himself, he\ncould help fix.\n* * *\nAs much as it might have surprised him—for many years, he had humored Trump more\nthan embraced him—Kushner was in fact rather like his father-in-law. Jared’s father,\nCharlie, bore an eerie resemblance to Donald’s father, Fred. Both men dominated their\nchildren, and they did this so completely that their children, despite their demands,\nbecame devoted to them. In both instances, this was extreme stuff: belligerent,\nuncompromising, ruthless men creating long-suffering offspring who were driven to\nachieve their father’s approval. (Trump’s older brother, Freddy, failing in this effort, and,\nby many reports, gay, drank himself to death; he died in 1981 at age forty-three.) In\nbusiness meetings, observers would be nonplussed that Charlie and Jared Kushner\ninvariably greeted each other with a kiss and that the adult Jared called his father Daddy.\nNeither Donald nor Jared, no matter their domineering fathers, went into the world\nwith humility. Insecurity was soothed by entitlement. Both out-of-towners who were eager\nto prove themselves or lay rightful claim in Manhattan (Kushner from New Jersey, Trump\nfrom Queens), they were largely seen as overweening, smug, and arrogant. Each cultivated\na smooth affect, which could appear more comical than graceful. Neither, by choice nor\nawareness, could seem to escape his privilege. “Some people who are very privileged are\naware of it and put it away; Kushner not only seemed in every gesture and word to\nemphasize his privilege, but also not to be aware of it,” said one New York media\nexecutive who dealt with Kushner. Both men were never out of their circle of privilege.\nThe main challenge they set for themselves was to enter further into the privileged circle.\nSocial climbing was their work.\nJared’s focus was often on older men. Rupert Murdoch spent a surprising amount of\ntime with Jared, who sought advice from the older media mogul about the media business\n—which the young man was determined to break into. Kushner paid long court to Ronald\nPerelman, the billionaire financier and takeover artist, who later would host Jared and\nIvanka in his private shul on Jewish high holy days. And, of course, Kushner wooed\nTrump himself, who became a fan of the young man and was uncharacteristically tolerant\nabout his daughter’s conversion to Orthodox Judaism when that became a necessary next\nstep toward marriage. Likewise, Trump as a young man had carefully cultivated a set of\nolder mentors, including Roy Cohn, the flamboyant lawyer and fixer who had served as\nright-hand man to the red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy.\nAnd then there was the harsh fact that the world of Manhattan and particular its living\nvoice, the media, seemed to cruelly reject them. The media long ago turned on Donald\nTrump as a wannabe and lightweight, and wrote him off for that ultimate sin—anyway, the\nultimate sin in media terms—of trying to curry favor with the media too much. His fame,\nsuch as it was, was actually reverse fame—he was famous for being infamous. It was joke\nfame.\nTo understand the media snub, and its many levels of irony, there is no better place to\nlook than the New York Observer, the Manhattan media and society weekly that Kushner\nbought in 2006 for $10 million—by almost every estimate $10 million more than it was\nworth.\n* * *\nThe New York Observer was, when it launched in 1987, a rich man’s fancy, as much failed\nmedia often is. It was a bland weekly chronicle of the Upper East Side, New York’s\nwealthiest neighborhood. Its conceit was to treat this neighborhood like a small town. But\nnobody took any notice. Its frustrated patron, Arthur Carter, who made his money in the\nfirst generation of Wall Street consolidations, was introduced to Graydon Carter (no\nrelation), who had started Spy magazine, a New York imitation of the British satirical\npublication Private Eye. Spy was part of a set of 1980s publications—Manhattan, Inc., a\nrelaunched Vanity Fair, and New York— obsessed with the new rich and what seemed to\nbe a transformational moment in New York. Trump was both symbol of and punch line for\nthis new era of excess and celebrity and the media’s celebration of those things. Graydon\nCarter became the editor of the New York Observer in 1991 and not only refocused the\nweekly on big-money culture, but essentially made it a tip-sheet for the media writing\nabout media culture, and for members of the big-money culture who wanted to be in the\nmedia. There may never have been such a self-conscious and self-referential publication\nas the New York Observer.\nAs Donald Trump, along with many others of this new-rich ilk, sought to be covered\nby the media—Murdoch’s New York Post was the effective court recorder of this new\npublicity-hungry aristocracy—the New York Observer covered the process of him being\ncovered. The story of Trump was the story of how he tried to make himself a story. He\nwas shameless, campy, and instructive: if you were willing to risk humiliation, the world\ncould be yours. Trump became the objective correlative for the rising appetite for fame\nand notoriety. Trump came to believe he understood everything about the media—who\nyou need to know, what pretense you need to maintain, what information you could\nprofitably trade, what lies you might tell, what lies the media expected you to tell. And the\nmedia came to believe it knew everything about Trump—his vanities, delusions, and lies,\nand the levels, uncharted, to which he would stoop for ever more media attention.\nGraydon Carter soon used the New York Observer as his stepping-stone to Vanity Fair\n—where, he believed, he might have access to a higher level of celebrity than Donald\nTrump. Carter was followed at the Observer in 1994 by Peter Kaplan, an editor with a\nheightened sense of postmodern irony and ennui.\nTrump, in Kaplan’s telling, suddenly took on a new persona. Whereas he had before\nbeen the symbol of success and mocked for it, now he became, in a shift of zeitgeist (and\nof having to refinance a great deal of debt), a symbol of failure and mocked for it. This\nwas a complicated reversal, not just having to do with Trump, but of how the media was\nnow seeing itself. Donald Trump became a symbol of the media’s own self-loathing: the\ninterest in and promotion of Donald Trump was a morality tale about the media. Its\nultimate end was Kaplan’s pronouncement that Trump should not be covered anymore\nbecause every story about Donald Trump had become a cliché.\nAn important aspect of Kaplan’s New York Observer and its self-conscious inside\nmedia baseball was that the paper became the prime school for a new generation of media\nreporters flooding every other publication in New York as journalism itself became ever\nmore self-conscious and self-referential. To everyone working in media in New York,\nDonald Trump represented the ultimate shame of working in media in New York: you\nmight have to write about Donald Trump. Not writing about him, or certainly not taking\nhim at face value, became a moral stand.\nIn 2006, after Kaplan had edited the paper for fifteen years, Arthur Carter sold the\nObserver—which had never made a profit—to the then twenty-five-year-old Kushner, an\nunknown real estate heir interested in gaining stature and notoriety in the city. Kaplan was\nnow working for someone twenty-five years his junior, a man who, ironically, was just the\nkind of arriviste he would otherwise have covered.\nFor Kushner, owning the paper soon paid off, because, with infinite ironies not\nnecessarily apparent to him, it allowed him into the social circle where he met Donald\nTrump’s daughter, Ivanka, whom he married in 2009. But the paper did not, irksomely for\nKushner, pay off financially, which put him into increasing tension with Kaplan. Kaplan,\nin turn, began telling witty and devastating tales about the pretensions and callowness of\nhis new boss, which spread, in constant retelling, among his many media protégés and\nhence throughout the media itself.\nIn 2009, Kaplan left the paper, and Kushner—making a mistake that many rich men\nwho have bought vanity media properties are prone to making—tried to find a profit by\ncutting costs. In short order, the media world came to regard Kushner as the man who not\nonly took Peter Kaplan’s paper from him, but also ruined it, brutally and incompetently.\nAnd worse: in 2013, Kaplan, at fifty-nine, died of cancer. So, effectively, in the telling,\nKushner had killed him, too.\nMedia is personal. It is a series of blood scores. The media in its often collective mind\ndecides who is going to rise and who is going to fall, who lives and who dies. If you stay\naround long enough in the media eye, your fate, like that of a banana republic despot, is\noften an unkind one—a law Hillary Clinton was not able to circumvent. The media has the\nlast word.\nLong before he ran for president, Trump and his sidekick son-in-law Kushner had been\nmarked not just for ignominy, but for slow torture by ridicule, contempt, and ever-more\namusing persiflage. These people are nothing. They are media debris. For goodness’ sake!\nTrump, in a smart move, picked up his media reputation and relocated it from a\nhypercritical New York to a more value-free Hollywood, becoming the star of his own\nreality show, The Apprentice, and embracing a theory that would serve him well during his\npresidential campaign: in flyover country, there is no greater asset than celebrity. To be\nfamous is to be loved—or at least fawned over.\nThe fabulous, incomprehensible irony that the Trump family had, despite the media’s\ndistaste, despite everything the media knows and understands and has said about them,\nrisen to a level not only of ultimate consequence but even of immortality is beyond worstcase\nnightmare and into cosmic-joke territory. In this infuriating circumstance, Trump and\nhis son-in-law were united, always aware and yet never quite understanding why they\nshould be the butt of a media joke, and now the target of its stunned outrage.\n* * *\nThe fact that Trump and his son-in-law had many things in common did not mean they\noperated on a common playing field. Kushner, no matter how close to Trump, was yet a\nmember of the Trump entourage, with no more ultimate control of his father-in-law than\nanybody else now in the business of trying to control Trump.\nStill, the difficulty of controlling him had been part of Kushner’s self-justification or\nrationalization for stepping beyond his family role and taking a senior White House job: to\nexercise restraint on his father-in-law and even—a considerable stretch for the\ninexperienced young man—to help lend him some gravitas.\nIf Bannon was going to pursue as his first signature White House statement the travel\nban, then Kushner was going to pursue as his first leadership mark a meeting with the\nMexican president, whom his father-in-law had threatened and insulted throughout the\ncampaign.\nKushner called up the ninety-three-year-old Kissinger for advice. This was both to\nflatter the old man and to be able to drop his name, but it was also actually for real advice.\nTrump had done nothing but cause problems for the Mexican president. To bring the\nMexican president to the White House would be, despite Bannon’s no-pivot policy from\nthe campaign’s harshness, a truly meaningful pivot for which Kushner would be able to\nclaim credit (although don’t call it a pivot). It was what Kushner believed he should be\ndoing: quietly following behind the president and with added nuance and subtlety\nclarifying the president’s real intentions, if not recasting them entirely.\nThe negotiation to bring Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto to the White House\nhad begun during the transition period. Kushner saw the chance to convert the issue of the\nwall into a bilateral agreement addressing immigration—hence a tour de force of\nTrumpian politics. The negotiations surrounding the visit reached their apogee on the\nWednesday after the inaugural, with a high-level Mexican delegation—the first visit by\nany foreign leader to the Trump White House—meeting with Kushner and Reince Priebus.\nKushner’s message to his father-in-law that afternoon was that Peña Nieto had signed on\nto a White House meeting and planning for the visit could go forward.\nThe next day Trump tweeted: “The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with\nMexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers\n…” And he continued in the next tweet … “of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is\nunwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming\nmeeting …”\nAt which point Peña Nieto did just that, leaving Kushner’s negotiation and statecraft as\nso much scrap on the floor.\n* * *\nOn Friday, February 3, at breakfast at the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown, an epicenter\nof the swamp, Ivanka Trump, flustered, came down the stairs and entered the dining room,\ntalking loudly on her cell phone: “Things are so messed up and I don’t know how to fix\nit… .”\nThe week had been overwhelmed by continuing fallout from the immigration order—\nthe administration was in court and headed to a brutal ruling against it—and more\nembarrassing leaks of two theoretically make-nice phone calls, one with the Mexican\npresident (“bad hombres”) and the other with the Australian prime minister (“my worst\ncall by far”). What’s more, the day before, Nordstrom had announced that it was dropping\nIvanka Trump’s clothing line.\nThe thirty-five-year-old was a harried figure, a businesswoman who had had to\nabruptly shift control of her business. She was also quite overwhelmed by the effort of\nhaving just moved her three children into a new house in a new city—and having to do\nthis largely on her own. Asked how his children were adjusting to their new school several\nweeks after the move, Jared said that yes, they were indeed in school—but he could not\nimmediately identify where.\nStill, in another sense, Ivanka was landing on her feet. Breakfast at the Four Seasons\nwas a natural place for her. She was among everyone who was anyone. In the restaurant\nthat morning: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi; Blackstone CEO Stephen\nSchwarzman; Washington fixture, lobbyist, and Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan; labor\nsecretary nominee Wilbur Ross; Bloomberg Media CEO Justin Smith; Washington Post\nnational reporter Mark Berman; and a table full of women lobbyists and fixers, including\nthe music industry’s longtime representative in Washington, Hillary Rosen; Elon Musk’s\nD.C. adviser, Juleanna Glover; Uber’s political and policy executive, Niki Christoff; and\nTime Warner’s political affairs executive, Carol Melton.\nIn some sense—putting aside both her father’s presence in the White House and his\ntirades against draining the swamp, which might otherwise include most everyone here,\nthis was the type of room Ivanka had worked hard to be in. Following the route of her\nfather, she was crafting her name and herself into a multifaceted, multiproduct brand; she\nwas also transitioning from her father’s aspirational male golf and business types to\naspirational female mom and business types. She had, well before her father’s presidency\ncould have remotely been predicted, sold a book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules\nfor Success, for $1 million.\nIn many ways, it had been an unexpected journey, requiring more discipline than you\nmight expect from a contented, distracted, run-of-the-mill socialite. As a twenty-one-yearold,\nshe appeared in a film made by her then boyfriend, Jamie Johnson, a Johnson &\nJohnson heir. It’s a curious, even somewhat unsettling film, in which Johnson corrals his\nset of rich-kid friends into openly sharing their dissatisfactions, general lack of ambition,\nand contempt for their families. (One of his friends would engage in long litigation with\nhim over the portrayal.) Ivanka, speaking with something like a Valley Girl accent—which\nwould transform in the years ahead into something like a Disney princess voice—seems\nno more ambitious or even employed than anyone else, but she is notably less angry with\nher parents.\nShe treated her father with some lightness, even irony, and in at least one television\ninterview she made fun of his comb-over. She often described the mechanics behind it to\nfriends: an absolutely clean pate—a contained island after scalp reduction surgery—\nsurrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are\ndrawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The\ncolor, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men—the\nlonger it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump’s orange-blond hair\ncolor.\nFather and daughter got along almost peculiarly well. She was the real mini-Trump (a\ntitle that many people now seemed to aspire to). She accepted him. She was a helper not\njust in his business dealings, but in his marital realignments. She facilitated entrances and\nexits. If you have a douchebag dad, and if everyone is open about it, then maybe it\nbecomes fun and life a romantic comedy—sort of.\nReasonably, she ought to be much angrier. She grew up not just in the middle of a\ntroubled family but in one that was at all times immersed in bad press. But she was able to\nbifurcate reality and live only in the uppermost part of it, where the Trump name, no\nmatter how often tarnished, nevertheless had come to be an affectionately tolerated\npresence. She resided in a bubble of other wealthy people who thrived on their\nrelationship with one another—at first among private school and Upper East Side of\nManhattan friends, then among social, fashion, and media contacts. What’s more, she\ntended to find protection as well as status in her boyfriends’ families, aggressively bonding\nwith a series of wealthy suitors’ families—including Jamie Johnson’s before the Kushners\n—over her own.\nThe Ivanka-Jared relationship was shepherded by Wendi Murdoch, herself a curious\nsocial example (to nobody so much as to her then husband, Rupert). The effort among a\nnew generation of wealthy women was to recast life as a socialite, turning a certain model\nof whimsy and noblesse oblige into a new status as a power woman, a kind of postfeminist\nsocialite. In this, you worked at knowing other rich people, the best rich people, and of\nbeing an integral and valuable part of a network of the rich, and of having your name itself\nevoke, well … riches. You weren’t satisfied with what you had, you wanted more. This\nrequired quite a level of indefatigability. You were marketing a product—yourself. You\nwere your own start-up.\nThis was what her father had always done. This, more than real estate, was the family\nbusiness.\nShe and Kushner then united as a power couple, consciously recasting themselves as\nfigures of ultimate attainment, ambition, and satisfaction in the new global world and as\nrepresentatives of a new eco-philanthropic-art sensibility. For Ivanka, this included her\nfriendship with Wendi Murdoch and with Dasha Zhukova, the then wife of the Russian\noligarch Roman Abramovich, a fixture in the international art world, and, just a few\nmonths before the election, attending a Deepak Chopra seminar on mediation with\nKushner. She was searching for meaning—and finding it. This transformation was further\nexpressed not just in ancillary clothing, jewelry, and footwear lines, as well as reality TV\nprojects, but in a careful social media presence. She became a superbly coordinated\neverymom, who would, with her father’s election, recast herself again, this time as royal\nfamily.\nAnd yet, the larger truth was that Ivanka’s relationship with her father was in no way a\nconventional family relationship. If it wasn’t pure opportunism, it was certainly\ntransactional. It was business. Building the brand, the presidential campaign, and now the\nWhite House—it was all business.\nBut what did Ivanka and Jared really think of their father and father-in-law? “There’s\ngreat, great, great affection—you see it, you really do,” replied Kellyanne Conway,\nsomewhat avoiding the question.\n“They’re not fools,” said Rupert Murdoch when asked the question.\n“They understand him, I think truly,” reflected Joe Scarborough. “And they appreciate\nhis energy. But there’s detachment.” That is, Scarborough went on, they have tolerance but\nfew illusions.\n* * *\nIvanka’s breakfast that Friday at the Four Seasons was with Dina Powell, the latest\nGoldman Sachs executive to join the White House.\nIn the days after the election, Ivanka and Jared had both met with a revolving door of\nlawyers and PR people, most of them, the couple found, leery of involvement, not least\nbecause the couple seemed less interested in bending to advice and more interested in\nshopping for the advice they wanted. In fact, much of the advice they were getting had the\nsame message: surround yourself—acquaint yourselves—with figures of the greatest\nestablishment credibility. In effect: you are amateurs, you need professionals.\nOne name that kept coming up was Powell’s. A Republican operative who had gone on\nto high influence and compensation at Goldman Sachs, she was quite the opposite of\nanyone’s notion of a Trump Republican. Her family emigrated from Egypt when she was a\ngirl, and she is fluent in Arabic. She worked her way up through a series of stalwart\nRepublicans, including Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and House Speaker Dick\nArmey. In the Bush White House she served as chief of the personnel office and an\nassistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs. She went to Goldman in\n2007 and became a partner in 2010, running its philanthropic outreach, the Goldman\nSachs Foundation. Following a trend in the careers of many poiitical operatives, she had\nbecome, as well as an über networker, a corporate public affairs and PR-type adviser—\nsomeone who knew the right people in power and had a keen sensitivity to how other\npeople’s power can be used.\nThe table of women lobbyists and communications professionals in the Four Seasons\nthat morning was certainly as interested in Powell, and her presence in the new\nadministration, as they were in the president’s daughter. If Ivanka Trump was a figure\nmore of novelty than of seriousness, the fact that she had helped bring Powell into the\nWhite House and was now publicly conferring with her added a further dimension to the\npresident’s daughter. In a White House seeming to pursue a dead-set Trumpian way, this\nwas a hint of an alternative course. In the assessment of the other fixers and PR women at\nthe Four Seasons, this was a potential shadow White House—Trump’s own family not\nassaulting the power structure but expressing an obvious enthusiasm for it.\nIvanka, after a long breakfast, made her way through the room. Between issuing\nsnappish instructions on her phone, she bestowed warm greetings and accepted business\ncards.\n6\nAt HQME\nW\nithin the first weeks of his presidency a theory emerged among Trump’s friends\nthat he was not acting presidential, or, really, in any way taking into account his\nnew status or restraining his behavior—from early morning tweets, to his refusal to follow\nscripted remarks, to his self-pitying calls to friends, details of which were already making\nit into the press—because he hadn’t taken the leap that others before him had taken. Most\npresidents arrived in the White House from more or less ordinary political life, and could\nnot help but be awed and reminded of their transformed circumstances by their sudden\nelevation to a mansion with palacelike servants and security, a plane at constant readiness,\nand downstairs a retinue of courtiers and advisers. But this would not have been that\ndifferent from Trump’s former life in Trump Tower, which was more commodious and to\nhis taste than the White House, with servants, security, courtiers, and advisers always on\nthe premises and a plane at the ready. The big deal of being president was not so apparent\nto him.\nBut another theory of the case was exactly opposite: he was totally off-kilter here\nbecause everything in his orderly world had been thrown on its head. In this view, the\nseventy-year-old Trump was a creature of habit at a level few people without despotic\ncontrol of their environment could ever imagine. He had lived in the same home, a vast\nspace in Trump Tower, since shortly after the building was completed in 1983. Every\nmorning since, he had made the same commute to his office a few floors down. His corner\noffice was a time capsule from the 1980s, the same gold-lined mirrors, the same Time\nmagazine covers fading on the wall; the only substantial change was the substitution of\nJoe Namath’s football for Tom Brady’s. Outside the doors to his office, everywhere he\nlooked there were the same faces, the same retainers—servants, security, courtiers, the\n“yes people”—who had attended him basically always.\n“Can you imagine how disruptive it would be if that’s what you did every day and then\nsuddenly you’re in the White House?” marveled a longtime Trump friend, smiling broadly\nat this trick of fate, if not abrupt comeuppance.\nTrump found the White House, an old building with only sporadic upkeep and\npiecemeal renovations—as well as a famous roach and rodent problem—to be vexing and\neven a little scary. Friends who admired his skills as a hotelier wondered why he just\ndidn’t remake the place, but he seemed cowed by the weight of the watchful eyes on him.\nKellyanne Conway, whose family had remained in New Jersey, and who had\nanticipated that she could commute home when the president went back to New York, was\nsurprised that New York and Trump Tower were suddenly stricken from his schedule.\nConway thought that the president, in addition to being aware of the hostility in New\nYork, was making a conscious effort to be “part of this great house.” (But, acknowledging\nthe difficulties inherent in his change of circumstances and of adapting to presidential\nlifestyle, she added, “How often will he go to Camp David?”—the Spartan, woodsy\npresidential retreat in Catoctin Mountain Park in Maryland—“How ’bout never.”)\nAt the White House, he retreated to his own bedroom—the first time since the\nKennedy White House that a presidential couple had maintained separate rooms (although\nMelania was spending scant time so far in the White House). In the first days he ordered\ntwo television screens in addition to the one already there, and a lock on the door,\nprecipitating a brief standoff with the Secret Service, who insisted they have access to the\nroom. He reprimanded the housekeeping staff for picking up his shirt from the floor: “If\nmy shirt is on the floor, it’s because I want it on the floor.” Then he imposed a set of new\nrules: nobody touch anything, especially not his toothbrush. (He had a longtime fear of\nbeing poisoned, one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald’s—nobody knew he was\ncoming and the food was safely premade.) Also, he would let housekeeping know when\nhe wanted his sheets done, and he would strip his own bed.\nIf he was not having his six-thirty dinner with Steve Bannon, then, more to his liking,\nhe was in bed by that time with a cheeseburger, watching his three screens and making\nphone calls—the phone was his true contact point with the world—to a small group of\nfriends, among them most frequently Tom Barrack, who charted his rising and falling\nlevels of agitation through the evening and then compared notes with one another.\n* * *\nBut after the rocky start, things started to look better—even, some argued, presidential.\nOn Tuesday, January 31, in an efficiently choreographed prime-time ceremony, an\nupbeat and confident President Trump announced the nomination of federal appellate\njudge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a perfect combination of\nimpeccable conservative standing, admirable probity, and gold-standard legal and judicial\ncredentials. The nomination not only delivered on Trump’s promise to the base and to the\nconservative establishment, but it was a choice that seemed perfectly presidential.\nGorsuch’s nomination was also a victory for a staff that had seen Trump, with this\nplum job and rich reward in his hand, waver again and again. Pleased by how the\nnomination was received, especially by how little fault the media could find with it,\nTrump would shortly become a Gorsuch fan. But before settling on Gorsuch, he wondered\nwhy the job wasn’t going to a friend and loyalist. In the Trump view, it was rather a waste\nto give the job to someone he didn’t even know.\nAt various points in the process he had run through almost all his lawyer friends—all\nof them unlikely, if not peculiar, choices, and, in almost every case, political nonstarters.\nThe one unlikely, peculiar, and nonstarter choice that he kept returning to was Rudy\nGiuliani.\nTrump owed Giuliani; not that he was so terribly focused on his debts, but this was one\nthat was certainly unpaid. Not only was Giuliani a longtime New York friend, but when\nfew Republicans were offering Trump their support, and almost none with a national\nreputation, Giuliani was there for him—and in combative, fiery, and relentless fashion.\nThis was particularly true during the hard days following Billy Bush: when virtually\neverybody, including the candidate himself, Bannon, Conway, and his children, believed\nthe campaign would implode, Giuliani barely allowed himself a break from his nonstop,\npassionate, and unapologetic Trump defense.\nGiuliani wanted to be the secretary of state, and Trump had in so many words offered\nhim the job. The resistance to Giuliani from the Trump circle derived from the same\nreason Trump was inclined to give him the job—Giuliani had Trump’s ear and wouldn’t\nlet go. The staff whispered about his health and stability. Even his full-on pussygate\ndefense now started to seem like a liability. He was offered attorney general, Department\nof Homeland Security, and director of national intelligence, but he turned them all down,\ncontinuing to hold out for State. Or, in what staffers took to be the ultimate presumption,\nor grand triangulation, the Supreme Court. Since Trump could not put someone openly\npro-choice on the court without both sundering his base and risking defeat of his nominee,\nthen, of course, he’d have to give Giuliani State.\nWhen this strategy failed—Rex Tillerson got the secretary of state job—that should\nhave been the end of it, but Trump kept returning to the idea of putting Giuliani on the\ncourt. On February 8, during the confirmation process, Gorsuch took public exception to\nTrump’s disparagement of the courts. Trump, in a moment of pique, decided to pull his\nnomination and, during conversations with his after-dinner callers, went back to\ndiscussing how he should have given the nod to Rudy. He was the only loyal guy. It was\nBannon and Priebus who kept having to remind him, and to endlessly repeat, that in one of\nthe campaign’s few masterful pieces of issue-defusing politics, and perfect courtship of the\nconservative base, it had let the Federalist Society produce a list of candidates. The\ncampaign had promised that the nominee would come from that list—and needless to say,\nGiuliani wasn’t on it.\nGorsuch was it. And Trump would shortly not remember when he had ever wanted\nanyone but Gorsuch.\n* * *\nOn February 3, the White House hosted a carefully orchestrated meeting of one of the\nnewly organized business councils, the president’s Strategic and Policy Forum. It was a\ngroup of highly placed CEOs and weighty business types brought together by Blackstone\nchief Stephen Schwarzman. The planning for the event—with a precise agenda,\nchoreographed seating and introductions, and fancy handouts—was more due to\nSchwarzman than to the White House. But it ended up being the kind of event that Trump\ndid very well at and very much enjoyed. Kellyanne Conway, often referencing the\nSchwarzman gathering, would soon begin a frequent theme of complaint, namely that\nthese kinds of events—Trump sitting down with serious-minded people and looking for\nsolutions to the nation’s problems—were the soul of Trump’s White House and the media\nwas giving them scant coverage.\nHosting business advisory councils was a Kushner strategy. It was an enlightened\nbusiness approach, distracting Trump from what Kushner viewed as the unenlightened\nright-wing agenda. To an increasingly scornful Bannon, its real purpose was to allow\nKushner himself to consort with CEOs.\nSchwarzman reflected what to many was a surprising and sudden business and Wall\nStreet affinity for Trump. Although few major-company CEOs had publicly supported him\n—with many, if not all, big companies planning for a Hillary Clinton victory and already\nhiring Clinton-connected public policy teams and with a pervasive media belief that a\nTrump victory would assure a market tailspin—there was suddenly an overnight warming.\nAn antiregulatory White House and the promise of tax reform outweighed the prospect of\ndisruptive tweeting and other forms of Trump chaos; besides, the market had not stopped\nclimbing since November 9, the day after the election. What’s more, in one-on-one\nmeetings, CEOs were reporting good vibes from Trump’s effusive and artful flattery—and\nthe sudden relief of not having to deal with what some knew to be relentless Clinton-team\nhondling (what can you do for us today and can we use your plan?).\nOn the other hand, while there was a warming C-suite feeling for Trump, there was\nalso rising concern about the consumer side of many big brands. The Trump brand was\nsuddenly the world’s biggest brand—the new Apple, except the opposite, since it was\nuniversally disdained (at least among many of the consumers who most top brands sought\nto court).\nHence, on inaugural morning, the employees of Uber, the ride sharing company, whose\nthen CEO Travis Kalanick had signed on to the Schwarzman council, woke up to find\npeople chained to the doors of their San Francisco headquarters. The charge was that Uber\nand Kalanick were “collaborating”—with its whiff of Vichy—a much different status than\na business looking to sober forums with the president as a way to influence the\ngovernment. Indeed, the protesters who believed they were seeing the company’s\nrelationship with Trump in political terms were actually seeing this in conventional brand\nterms and zooming in on the disconnect. Uber’s customer base is strongly young, urban,\nand progressive, and therefore out of sync with the Trump base. Brand-conscious\nmillennials saw this as beyond policy dickering and as part of an epic identity clash. The\nTrump White House stood less for government and the push-pull of competing interests\nand developing policies, and more, in a brand-savvy world, as a fixed and unpopular\ncultural symbol.\nUber’s Kalanick resigned from the council. Disney CEO Bob Iger simply found that he\nwas otherwise occupied on the occasion of the forum’s first meeting.\nBut most of the people on the council—other than Elon Musk, the investor, inventor,\nand founder of Tesla (who would later resign)—were not from media or tech companies,\nwith their liberal bent, but from old-line, when-America-was-great enterprises. They\nincluded Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors; Ginni Rometty of IBM; Jack Welch,\nthe former CEO of GE; Jim McNerney, the former CEO of Boeing; and Indra Nooyi of\nPepsiCo. If the new right had elected Trump, it was the older Fortune 100 executives who\nmost pleased him.\nTrump attended the meeting with his full retinue—the circle that seemed always to\nmove with him in lockstep, including Bannon, Priebus, Kushner, Stephen Miller, and\nNational Economic Council chief Gary Cohn—but conducted it entirely himself. Each of\nthe people at the table, taking a point of interest, spoke for five minutes, with Trump then\nasking follow-up questions. Though Trump appeared not to have particularly, or at all,\nprepared for any of the subjects being discussed, he asked engaged and interested\nquestions, pursuing things he wanted to know more about, making the meeting quite an\neasy back-and-forth. One of the CEOs observed that this seemed like the way Trump\npreferred to get information—talking about what he was interested in and getting other\npeople to talk about his interests.\nThe meeting went on for two hours. In the White House view, this was Trump at his\nbest. He was most at home around people he respected—and these were “the most\nrespected people in the country,” according to Trump—who seemed to respect him, too.\nThis became a staff goal—to create situations in which he was comfortable, to\nconstruct something of a bubble, to wall him off from a mean-spirited world. Indeed, they\nsought to carefully replicate this formula: Trump in the Oval or in a larger West Wing\nceremonial room presiding in front of a receptive audience, with a photo opportunity.\nTrump was often his own stage manager at these events, directing people in and out of the\npicture.\n* * *\nThe media has a careful if selective filter when it comes to portraying real life in the White\nHouse. The president and First Family are not, at least not usually, subjected to the sort of\npaparazzi pursuit that in celebrity media results in unflattering to embarrassing to mocking\nphotographs, or in endless speculation about their private lives. Even in the worst\nscandals, a businesslike suit-and-tie formality is still accorded the president. Saturday\nNight Live presidential skits are funny in part because they play on our belief that in\nreality, presidents are quite contained and buttoned-down figures, and their families,\ntrotting not far behind, colorless and obedient. The joke on Nixon was that he was pitiably\nuptight—even at the height of Watergate, drinking heavily, he remained in his coat and tie,\nkneeling in prayer. Gerald Ford merely tripped coming off Air Force One, providing great\nhilarity in this break from formal presidential poise. Ronald Reagan, likely suffering the\nearly effects of Alzheimer’s, remained a carefully managed picture of calm and\nconfidence. Bill Clinton, amid the greatest break in presidential decorum in modern\nhistory, was even so always portrayed as a man in control. George W. Bush, for all his\ndisengagement, was allowed by the media to be presented as dramatically in charge.\nBarack Obama, perhaps to his disadvantage, was consistently presented as thoughtful,\nsteady, and determined. This is partly a benefit of overweening image control, but it is also\nbecause the president is thought to be the ultimate executive—or because the national\nmyth requires him to be.\nThat was actually the kind of image that Donald Trump had worked to project\nthroughout most of his career. His is a 1950s businessman sort of ideal. He aspires to look\nlike his father—or, anyway, not to displease his father. Except when he’s in golf wear, it is\nhard to imagine him out of a suit and tie, because he almost never is. Personal dignity—\nthat is, apparent uprightness and respectability—is one of his fixations. He is\nuncomfortable when the men around him are not wearing suit and ties. Formality and\nconvention—before he became president, almost everybody without high celebrity or a\nbillion dollars called him “Mr. Trump”—are a central part of his identity. Casualness is the\nenemy of pretense. And his pretense was that the Trump brand stood for power, wealth,\narrival.\nOn the February 5, the New York Times published an inside-the-White-House story that\nhad the president, two weeks into his term, stalking around in the late hours of the night in\nhis bathrobe, unable to work the light switches. Trump fell apart. It was, the president not\nincorrectly saw, a way of portraying him as losing it, as Norma Desmond in the movie\nSunset Boulevard, a faded or even senile star living in a fantasy world. (This was\nBannon’s interpretation of the Times’s image of Trump, which was quickly adopted by\neveryone in the White House.) And, of course, once again, it was a media thing—he was\nbeing treated in a way that no other president had ever been treated.\nThis was not incorrect. The New York Times, in its efforts to cover a presidency that it\nopenly saw as aberrant, had added to its White House beat something of a new form of\ncoverage. Along with highlighting White House announcements—separating the trivial\nfrom the significant—the paper would also highlight, often in front-page coverage, the\nsense of the absurd, the pitiable, and the all-too-human. These stories turned Trump into a\nfigure of ridicule. The two White House reporters most consistently on this beat, Maggie\nHaberman and Glenn Thrush, would become part of Trump’s constant refrain about the\nmedia being out to get him. Thrush would even become a fixture in Saturday Night Live\nsketches that mocked the president, his children, his press secretary Sean Spicer, and his\nadvisers Bannon and Conway.\nThe president, while often a fabulist in his depiction of the world, was quite a literalist\nwhen it came to how he saw himself. Hence he rebutted this picture of him as a halfdemented\nor seriously addled midnight stalker in the White House by insisting that he\ndidn’t own a bathrobe.\n“Do I seem like a bathrobe kind of guy, really?” he demanded, not humorously, of\nalmost every person with whom he spoke over the next forty-eight hours. “Seriously, can\nyou see me in a bathrobe?”\nWho had leaked it? For Trump, the details of his personal life suddenly became a far\ngreater matter of concern than all the other kinds of leaks.\nThe New York Times Washington bureau, itself quite literal and worried by the possible\nlack of an actual bathrobe, reverse-leaked that Bannon was the source of the story.\nBannon, who styled himself as a kind of black hole of silence, had also become a sort\nof official black-hole voice, everybody’s Deep Throat. He was witty, intense, evocative,\nand bubbling over, his theoretical discretion ever giving way to a constant semipublic\ncommentary on the pretensions and fatuousness and hopeless lack of seriousness of most\neveryone else in the White House. By the second week of the Trump presidency,\neverybody in the White House seemed to be maintaining their own list of likely leakers\nand doing their best to leak before being leaked about.\nBut another likely leak source about his angst in the White House was Trump himself.\nIn his calls throughout the day and at night from his bed, he frequently spoke to people\nwho had no reason to keep his confidences. He was a river of grievances—including about\nwhat a dump the White House was on close inspection—examples of which many\nrecipients of his calls promptly spread throughout the ever attentive and merciless gossip\nworld.\n* * *\nOn February 6, Trump made one of his seething, self-pitying, and unsolicited phone calls\nwithout presumption of confidentiality to a passing New York media acquaintance. The\ncall had no discernible point other than to express his bent-out-of-shape feelings about the\nrelentless contempt of the media and the disloyalty of his staff.\nThe initial subject of his ire was the New York Times and its reporter Maggie\nHaberman, whom he called “a nut job.” The Times’s Gail Collins, who had written a\ncolumn unfavorably comparing Trump to Vice President Pence, was “a moron.” But then,\ncontinuing under the rubric of media he hated, he veered to CNN and the deep disloyalty\nof its chief, Jeff Zucker. Zucker, who as the head of NBC had commissioned The\nApprentice, had been “made by Trump,” Trump said of himself in the third person. And\nTrump had “personally” gotten Zucker his job at CNN. “Yes, yes, I did,” said Trump.\nHe then repeated a story that he was obsessively telling almost everyone he spoke to.\nHe’d gone to a dinner, he didn’t remember when, where he had sat next to “a gentleman\nnamed Kent”—undoubtedly Phil Kent, a former CEO of Turner Broadcasting, the Time\nWarner division that oversaw CNN—“and he had a list of four names.” Three of them\nTrump had never heard of, but he knew Jeff Zucker because of The Apprentice. “Zucker\nwas number four on the list, so I talked him up to number one. I probably shouldn’t have\nbecause Zucker is not that smart but I like to show I can do that sort of thing.” But Zucker,\n“a very bad guy who has done terrible with the ratings,” had turned around after Trump\nhad gotten him the job and had said, well, it’s “unbelievably disgusting.” This was the\nRussian “dossier” and the “golden shower” story—the practice CNN had accused him of\nbeing party to in the Moscow hotel suite with assorted prostitutes.\nHaving dispensed with Zucker, the president of the United States went on to speculate\non what was involved with a golden shower. And how this was all just part of a media\ncampaign that would never succeed in driving him from the White House. Because they\nwere sore losers and hated him for winning, they spread total lies, 100 percent made-up\nthings, totally untrue, for instance, the cover that week of Time magazine—which, Trump\nreminded his listeners, he had been on more than anyone in history—that showed Steve\nBannon, a good guy, saying he was the real president. “How much influence do you think\nSteve Bannon has over me?” Trump demanded and repeated the question, and then\nrepeated the answer: “Zero! Zero!” And that went for his son-in-law, too, who had a lot to\nlearn.\nThe media was not only hurting him, he said—he was not looking for any agreement or\nreally even any response—but hurting his negotiating capabilities, which hurt the nation.\nAnd that went for Saturday Night Live, too, which might think it was very funny but was\nactually hurting everybody in the country. And while he understood that SNL was there to\nbe mean to him, they were being very, very mean. It was “fake comedy.” He had reviewed\nthe treatment of all other presidents in the media and there was nothing like this ever, even\nof Nixon who was treated very unfairly. “Kellyanne, who is very fair, has this all\ndocumented. You can look at it.”\nThe point is, he said, that that very day, he had saved $700 million a year in jobs that\nwere going to Mexico but the media was talking about him in his bathrobe, which “I don’t\nhave because I’ve never worn a bathrobe. And would never wear one, because I’m not that\nkind of guy.” And what the media was doing was undermining this very dignified house,\nand “dignity is so important.” But Murdoch, “who had never called me, never once,” was\nnow calling all the time. So that should tell people something.\nThe call went on for twenty-six minutes.\n7\nRUSSIA\nE\nven before there was reason to suspect Sally Yates, they suspected her. The transition\nreport said Trump wouldn’t like the fifty-six-year-old Atlanta-born University of\nGeorgia career Justice Department lawyer slated to step up to acting attorney general.\nThere was something about a particular kind of Obama person. Something about the way\nthey walked and held themselves. Superiority. And about a certain kind of woman who\nwould immediately rub Trump the wrong way—Obama women being a good tip-off,\nHillary women another. Later this would be extended to “DOJ women.”\nHere was an elemental divide: between Trump and career government employees. He\ncould understand politicians, but he was finding it hard to get a handle on these bureaucrat\ntypes, their temperament and motives. He couldn’t grasp what they wanted. Why would\nthey, or anyone, be a permanent government employee? “They max out at what? Two\nhundred grand? Tops,” he said, expressing something like wonder.\nSally Yates could have been passed over for the acting AG spot—to serve in place\nwhile the attorney-general-designate, Jeff Sessions, waited for confirmation—and before\nlong Trump would be furious about why she wasn’t. But she was the sitting deputy and\nshe’d been confirmed by the Senate, and the acting AG job needed someone with Senate\nconfirmation. And even though she seemed to see herself as something of a prisoner held\nin hostile territory, Yates accepted the job.\nGiven this context, the curious information she presented to White House counsel Don\nMcGahn during the administration’s first week—this was before, in the second week, she\nrefused to enforce the immigration order and was thereupon promptly fired—seemed not\nonly unwelcome but suspect.\nThe newly confirmed National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, had brushed off\nreports in the Washington Post about a conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey\nKislyak. It was a simple meet and greet, he said. He assured the transition team—among\nothers, Vice President-elect Pence—that there were no discussions of Obama\nadministration sanctions against the Russians, an assurance Pence publicly repeated.\nYates now told the White House that Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak had actually\nbeen captured as part of an “incidental collection” of authorized wiretaps. That is, a\nwiretap had presumably been authorized on the Russian ambassador by the secret Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court and, incidentally, picked up Flynn.\nThe FISA court had achieved a moment of notoriety after the Edward Snowden\nrevelations briefly made it a bête noire for liberals who were angry about privacy\nincursions. Now it was achieving another moment, but this time as the friend of liberals,\nwho hoped to use these “incidental” wiretaps as a way to tie the Trump camp to a wideranging\nconspiracy with Russia.\nIn short order, McGahn, Priebus, and Bannon, each with prior doubts about Flynn’s\nreliability and judgment—“a fuck-up,” according to Bannon—conferred about the Yates\nmessage. Flynn was asked again about his call with Kislyak; he was also told that a\nrecording might exist. Again he scoffed at any suggestion that this was a meaningful\nconversation about anything.\nIn one White House view, Yates’s tattling was little more than “like she found out her\ngirlfriend’s husband flirted with somebody else and, standing on principle, had to tell on\nhim.”\nOf more alarm to the White House was how, in an incidental collection wherein the\nnames of American citizens are supposedly “masked”—with complicated procedures\nrequired to “unmask” them—had Yates so handily and conveniently picked up Flynn? Her\nreport would also seem to confirm that the leak to the Post about these recordings came\nfrom the FBI, DOJ, or Obama White House sources—part of the growing river of leaks,\nwith the Times and the Post the leakers’ favored destinations.\nThe White House in its assessment of the Yates message ended up seeing this as less a\nproblem with an always hard-to-handle Flynn than as a problem with Yates, even as a\nthreat from her: the Justice Department, with its vast staff of career and Obama-inclined\nprosecutors, had ears on the Trump team.\n* * *\n“It’s unfair,” said Kellyanne Conway, sitting in her yet undecorated second-floor office\nwhile representing the president’s hurt feelings. “It’s obviously unfair. It’s very unfair.\nThey lost. They didn’t win. This is so unfair. So POTUS just doesn’t want to talk about\nit.”\nThere was nobody in the White House who wanted to talk about—or even anyone who\nhad been officially delegated to talk about—Russia, the story that, evident to most, even\nbefore they entered the White House, was certain to overwhelm the first year of the Trump\nadministration at the very least. Nobody was prepared to deal with it.\n“There’s no reason to even talk about it,” said Sean Spicer, sitting on the couch in his\noffice, firmly crossing his arms. “There’s no reason to even talk about it,” he said again,\nstubbornly.\nFor his part, the president did not use, though he might have, the word “Kafkaesque.”\nHe regarded the Russia story as senseless and inexplicable and having no basis in reality.\nThey were just being sucked in.\nThey had survived scandal during the campaign—the Billy Bush weekend—which\nvirtually no one in Trump’s inner circle had thought they could survive, only to be hit by\nthe Russia scandal. Compared to Pussy-gate, Russia seemed like the only-desperate-thingleft-gate.\nWhat seemed unfair now was that the issue still wasn’t going away, and that,\nincomprehensibly, people took it seriously. When at best it was … nothing.\nIt was the media.\nThe White House had quickly become accustomed to media-led scandals, but they\nwere also used to their passing. But now this one was, frustratingly, holding on.\nIf there was any single piece of proof not just of media bias but of the intention of the\nmedia to do anything it could to undermine this president, it was—in the view of the\nTrump circle—this, the Russia story, what the Washington Post termed “Russia’s attack on\nour political system.” (“So terribly, terribly unfair, with no proof of one vote changed,”\naccording to Conway.) It was insidious. It was, to them, although they didn’t put it this\nway, similar to the kind of dark Clinton-like conspiracies that Republicans were more\nwont to accuse liberals of—Whitewater, Benghazi, Email-gate. That is, an obsessive\nnarrative that leads to investigations, which lead to other investigations, and to more\nobsessive no-escape media coverage. This was modern politics: blood-sport conspiracies\nthat were about trying to destroy people and careers.\nWhen the comparison to Whitewater was made to Conway, she, rather proving the\npoint about obsessions, immediately began to argue the particulars involving Webster\nHubbell, a mostly forgotten figure in the Whitewater affair, and the culpability of the Rose\nLaw Firm in Arkansas, where Hillary Clinton was a partner. Everybody believed their\nside’s conspiracies, while utterly, and righteously, rejecting the conspiracies leveled at\nthem. To call something a conspiracy was to dismiss it.\nAs for Bannon, who had himself promoted many conspiracies, he dismissed the Russia\nstory in textbook fashion: “It’s just a conspiracy theory.” And, he added, the Trump team\nwasn’t capable of conspiring about anything.\n* * *\nThe Russia story was—just two weeks into the new presidency—a dividing line with each\nside viewing the other as pushing fake news.\nThe greater White House wholly believed that the story was an invented construct of\nweak if not preposterous narrative threads, with a mind-boggling thesis: We fixed the\nelection with the Russians, OMG! The anti-Trump world, and especially its media—that\nis, the media—believed that there was a high, if not overwhelming, likelihood that there\nwas something significant there, and a decent chance that it could be brought home.\nIf the media, self-righteously, saw it as the Holy Grail and silver bullet of Trump\ndestruction, and the Trump White House saw it, with quite some self-pity, as a desperate\neffort to concoct a scandal, there was also a range of smart money in the middle.\nThe congressional Democrats had everything to gain by insisting, Benghazi-like, that\nwhere there was smoke (even if they were desperately working the bellows) there was fire,\nand by using investigations as a forum to promote their minority opinion (and for\nmembers to promote themselves).\nFor Republicans in Congress, the investigations were a card to play against Trump’s\nvengefulness and unpredictability. Defending him—or something less than defending him\nand, indeed, possibly pursuing him—offered Republicans a new source of leverage in their\ndealings with him.\nThe intelligence community—with its myriad separate fiefdoms as suspicious of\nTrump as of any incoming president in memory—would, at will, have the threat of dripdrip-drip\nleaks to protect its own interests.\nThe FBI and DOJ would evaluate the evidence—and the opportunity—through their\nown lenses of righteousness and careerism. (“The DOJ is filled with women prosecutors\nlike Yates who hate him,” said a Trump aide, with a curiously gender-biased view of the\ngrowing challenge.)\nIf all politics is a test of your opponent’s strength, acumen, and forbearance, then this,\nregardless of the empirical facts, was quite a clever test, with many traps that many people\nmight fall into. Indeed, in many ways the issue was not Russia but, in fact, strength,\nacumen, and forbearance, the qualities Trump seemed clearly to lack. The constant\nharping about a possible crime, even if there wasn’t an actual crime—and no one was yet\npointing to a specific act of criminal collusion, or in fact any other clear violation of the\nlaw—could force a cover-up which might then turn into a crime. Or turn up a perfect\nstorm of stupidity and cupidity.\n“They take everything I’ve ever said and exaggerate it,” said the president in his first\nweek in the White House during a late-night call. “It’s all exaggerated. My exaggerations\nare exaggerated.”\n* * *\nFranklin Foer, the Washington-based former editor of the New Republic, made an early\ncase for a Trump-Putin conspiracy on July 4, 2016, in Slate. His piece reflected the\nincredulity that had suddenly possessed the media and political intelligentsia: Trump, the\nunserious candidate, had, however incomprehensibly, become a more or less serious one.\nAnd somehow, because of his prior unseriousness, and his what-you-see-is-what-you-get\nnature, the braggart businessman, with his bankruptcies, casinos, and beauty pageants, had\navoided serious vetting. For Trump students—which, over his thirty years of courting\nattention, many in the media had become—the New York real estate deals were dirty, the\nAtlantic City ventures were dirty, the Trump airline was dirty, Mar-a-Lago, the golf\ncourses, and the hotels all dirty. No reasonable candidate could have survived a recounting\nof even one of these deals. But somehow a genial amount of corruption had been figured\ninto the Trump candidacy—that, after all, was the platform he was running on. I’ll do for\nyou what a tough businessman does for himself.\nTo really see his corruption, you had to see it on a bigger stage. Foer was suggesting a\nfabulous one.\nAssembling a detailed road map for a scandal that did not yet exist, Foer, without\nanything resembling smoking guns or even real evidence, pulled together in July virtually\nall of the circumstantial and thematic threads and many of the various characters that\nwould play out over the next eighteen months. (Unbeknownst to the public or even most\nmedia or political insiders, Fusion GPS had by this point hired the former British spy\nChristopher Steele to investigate a connection between Trump and the Russian\ngovernment.)\nPutin was seeking a resurgence of Russian power and, as well, to block encroachments\nby the European Union and NATO. Trump’s refusal to treat Putin as a semi-outlaw—not\nto mention what often seemed like a man crush on him—meant, ipso facto, that Trump\nwas sanguine about a return of Russian power and might actually be promoting it.\nWhy? What could possibly be in it for an American politician to publicly embrace—\nsycophantically embrace—Vladimir Putin and to encourage what the West saw as Russian\nadventurism?\nTheory 1: Trump was drawn to authoritarian strongmen. Foer recounted Trump’s\nlongtime fascination with Russia, including being duped by a Gorbachev look-alike who\nvisited Trump Tower in the 1980s, and his many fulsome and unnecessary “odes to Putin.”\nThis suggested a lie-down-with-dogs-wake-up-with-fleas vulnerability: consorting with or\nlooking favorably upon politicians whose power lies partly in their tolerance of corruption\nbrings you closer to corruption. Likewise, Putin was drawn to populist strongmen in his\nown image: hence, Foer asked, “Why wouldn’t the Russians offer him the same furtive\nassistance they’ve lavished on Le Pen, Berlusconi, and the rest?”\nTheory 2: Trump was part of a less-than-blue-chip (much less) international business\nset, feeding off the rivers of dubious wealth that had been unleashed by all the efforts to\nmove cash, much of it from Russia and China, out of political harm’s way. Such money, or\nrumors of such money, became an explanation—still only a circumstantial one—in trying\nto assess all the Trump business dealings that largely remained hidden from view. (There\nwere two contradictory theories here: he had hidden these dealings because he didn’t want\nto admit their paucity, or he had hidden them to mask their disreputableness.) Because\nTrump is less than creditworthy, Foer was among many who concluded that Trump needed\nto turn to other sources—more or less dirty money, or money with other sorts of strings\nattached. (One way the process can work is, roughly speaking, as follows: an oligarch\nmakes an investment in a more or less legitimate third-party investment fund, which, quid\npro quo, makes an investment in Trump.) And while Trump would categorically deny that\nhe had any loans or investments from Russia, one would, of course, not have dirty money\non one’s books.\nAs a subset of this theory, Trump—never very scrupulous about vetting his people—\nsurrounded himself with a variety of hustlers working their own deals, and, plausibly,\naiding Trump’s deals. Foer identified the following characters as part of a possible Russian\nconspiracy:\n• Tevfik Arif, a former Rus sian official who ran the Bayrock Group, a middleman in\nTrump financings with an office in Trump Tower.\n• Felix Sater (sometimes spelled Satter), a Russian-born immigrant to Brighton Beach\nin Brooklyn, who had previously served time in prison in connection with a fraud at\na Mafia-run brokerage and who went to work for Bayrock and had a business card\nidentifying him as senior adviser to Donald Trump. (When Sater’s name later\ncontinued to surface, Trump assured Bannon he didn’t know Sater at all.)\n• Carter Page, a banker of uncertain portfolio who had spent time in Russia and billed\nhimself as having advised the state-run oil company, Gazprom, and who showed up\non a hastily assembled list of Trump foreign policy advisers and who, it would turn\nout, the FBI was closely monitoring in what it said was a Russian intelligence effort\nto turn him. (Trump would later deny ever meeting Page, and the FBI would say that\nit believed Russian intelligence had targeted Page in an effort to turn him.)\n• Michael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency—fired by\nObama for unclear reasons—who had yet to emerge as Trump’s key foreign policy\ncounselor and future National Security Advisor, but who was accompanying him on\nmany campaign trips and who earlier in the year had been paid a $45,000 speaking\nfee in Moscow and been photographed sitting at a dinner with Putin.\n• Paul Manafort, whom, along with serving as Trump’s campaign manager, Foer\nhighlighted as a political operative and consultant who had generated substantial\nincome advising Kremlin-backed Viktor Yanukovych, who successfully ran for the\npresidency of Ukraine in 2010, was later deposed in 2014, and had been in business\nwith the Russian oligarch and Putin crony Oleg Deripaska.\nMore than a year later, each of these men would be part of the near-daily Russia-Trump\nnews cycle.\nTheory 3: The Holy Grail proposition was that Trump and the Russians—perhaps even\nPutin himself—had gotten together to hack the Democratic National Committee.\nTheory 4: But then there was the those-that-know-him-best theory, some version of\nwhich most Trumpers would come to embrace. He was just star-fucking. He took his\nbeauty pageant to Russia because he thought Putin was going to be his friend. But Putin\ncouldn’t have cared less, and in the end Trump found himself at the promised gala dinner\nseated on one side next to a guy who looked like he had never used a utensil and on the\nother side Jabba the Hutt in a golf shirt. In other words, Trump—however foolish his\nsucking-up might have been, and however suspicious it might look in hindsight—just\nwanted a little respect.\nTheory 5: The Russians, holding damaging information about Trump, were\nblackmailing him. He was a Manchurian Candidate.\n* * *\nOn January 6, 2017—nearly six months to the day after Foer’s piece was published—the\nCIA, FBI, and NSA announced their joint conclusion that “Vladimir Putin ordered an\ninfluence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.” From the Steele\ndossier, to the steady leaks from the U.S. intelligence community, to testimony and\nstatements from the leadership of U.S. intelligence agencies, a firm consensus had\nemerged. There was a nefarious connection, perhaps an ongoing one, between Trump and\nhis campaign and the Russian government.\nStill, this could yet be seen as highly wishful thinking by Trump opponents. “The\nunderlying premise of the case is that spies tell the truth,” said the veteran intelligence\ncommunity journalist Edward Jay Epstein. “Who knew?” And, indeed, the worry in the\nWhite House was not about collusion—which seemed implausible if not farcical—but\nwhat, if the unraveling began, would likely lead to the messy Trump (and Kushner)\nbusiness dealings. On this subject every member of the senior staff shrugged helplessly,\ncovering eyes, ears, and mouth.\nThis was the peculiar and haunting consensus—not that Trump was guilty of all that he\nwas accused of, but that he was guilty of so much else. It was all too possible that the\nhardly plausible would lead to the totally credible.\n* * *\nOn February 13, twenty-four days into the new administration, National Security Advisor\nMichael Flynn became the first actual link between Russia and the White House.\nFlynn had really only one supporter in the Trump administration, and that was the\npresident himself. They were best friends during the campaign—buddy movie stuff. Postinauguration,\nthis translated into a total-access relationship. On Flynn’s part, it led to a set\nof misapprehensions that was common inside Trump’s circle: that the president’s personal\nendorsement indicated your status in the White House and that Trump’s level of flattery\nwas a convincing indication that you had an unbreakable bond with him and that you\nwere, in his eyes, and in his White House, something close to omnipotent. Trump, with his\nlove of generals, had even for a moment wanted to make Michael Flynn his vice president.\nIntoxicated by Trump’s flattery during the campaign, Flynn—a lower-tier general and\nquite a flaky one at that—had become something of a Trump dancing monkey. When\nformer generals make alliances with political candidates, they customarily position\nthemselves as providers of expertise and figures of a special maturity. But Flynn had\nbecome quite a maniacal partisan, part of the Trump traveling road show, one of the\nranters and ravers opening Trump rallies. This all-in enthusiasm and loyalty had helped\nwin him access to Trump’s ear, into which he poured his anti-intelligence-community\ntheories.\nDuring the early part of the transition, when Bannon and Kushner had seemed joined at\nthe hip, this was part of their bond: an effort to disintermediate Flynn and his often\nproblematic message. A subtext in the White House estimation of Flynn, slyly insinuated\nby Bannon, was that Defense Secretary Mattis was a four-star general and Flynn but a\nthree-star.\n“I like Flynn, he reminds me of my uncles,” said Bannon. “But that’s the problem: he\nreminds me of my uncles.”\nBannon used the general odor that had more and more attached to Flynn among\neverybody except the president to help secure a seat for himself on the National Security\nCouncil. This was, for many in the national security community, a signal moment in the\neffort by the nationalist right wing to seize power. But Bannon’s presence on the council\nwas just as much driven by the need to babysit the impetuous Flynn, prone to antagonizing\nalmost everyone else in the national security community. (Flynn was “a colonel in a\ngeneral’s uniform,” according to one senior intelligence figure.)\nFlynn, like everyone around Trump, was besotted by the otherworldly sense of\nopportunity that came with, against all odds, being in the White House. And inevitably, he\nhad been made more grandiose by it.\nIn 2014, Flynn had been roughly cashiered out of government, for which he blamed his\nmany enemies in the CIA. But he had energetically set himself up in business, joining the\nranks of former government officials profiting off the ever growing globalist corporatefinancial-government\npolicy and business networks. Then, after flirting with several other\nRepublican presidential candidates, he bonded with Trump. Both Flynn and Trump were\nantiglobalists—or, anyway, they believed the United States was getting screwed in global\ntransactions. Still, money was money, and Flynn, who, when he retired, had been\nreceiving a few hundred thousand a year on his general’s pension, was not turning any of\nit down. Various friends and advisers—including Michael Ledeen, a longtime anti-Iran\nand anti-CIA crony, and the coauthor of Flynn’s book, whose daughter now worked for\nFlynn—advised Flynn that he ought not to accept fees from Russia or the larger\n“consulting” assignments from Turkey.\nIt was in fact the sort of carelessness that almost everyone in Trump’s world, including\nthe president and his family, was guilty of. They lived with parallel realities in which,\nwhile proceeding with a presidential campaign, they also had to live in a vastly more\nlikely world—rather a certain world—in which Donald Trump would never be president.\nHence, business as usual.\nIn early February, an Obama administration lawyer friendly with Sally Yates remarked\nwith some relish and considerable accuracy: “It certainly is an odd circumstance if you\nlive your life without regard for being elected and then get elected—and quite an\nopportunity for your enemies.”\nIn this, there was not only the Russian cloud hanging over the administration, but a\nsense that the intelligence community so distrusted Flynn, and so blamed its bad blood\nwith Trump on him, that Flynn was the target here. Within the White House there was\neven a feeling that a soft trade was being implicitly offered: Flynn for the goodwill of the\nintelligence community.\nAt the same time, in what some thought a direct result of the president’s rage over the\nRussia insinuations—particularly the insinuation about the golden shower—the president\nseemed to bond even more strongly with Flynn, assuring his National Security Advisor\nover and over again that he had his back, that the Russia accusations, those related both to\nFlynn and to himself, were “garbage.” After Flynn’s dismissal, a narrative describing\nTrump’s increasing doubts about his adviser would be offered to the press, but in fact the\nopposite was true: the more doubts gathered around Flynn, the more certain the president\nbecame that Flynn was his all-important ally.\n* * *\nThe final or deadliest leak during Michael Flynn’s brief tenure is as likely to have come\nfrom the National Security Advisor’s antagonists inside the White House as from the\nJustice Department.\nOn Wednesday, February 8, the Washington Post’s Karen DeYoung came to visit Flynn\nfor what was billed as an off-the-record interview. They met not in his office but in the\nmost ornate room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building—the same room where\nJapanese diplomats waited to meet with Secretary of State Cordell Hull as he learned of\nthe attack on Pearl Harbor.\nTo all outward appearances, it was an uneventful background interview, and DeYoung,\nColumbo-like in her affect, aroused no suspicions when she broached the de rigueur\nquestion: “My colleagues asked me to ask you this: Did you talk to the Russians about\nsanctions?”\nFlynn declared that he had had no such conversations, absolutely no conversation, he\nconfirmed again, and the interview, attended by senior National Security Council official\nand spokesman Michael Anton, ended soon thereafter.\nBut later that day, DeYoung called Anton and asked if she could use Flynn’s denial on\nthe record. Anton said he saw no problem—after all, the White House wanted Flynn’s\ndenial to be clear—and notified Flynn.\nA few hours later, Flynn called Anton back with some worries about the statement.\nAnton applied an obvious test: “If you knew that there might be a tape of this conversation\nthat could surface, would you still be a hundred percent sure?”\nFlynn equivocated, and Anton, suddenly concerned, advised him that if he couldn’t be\nsure they ought to “walk it back.”\nThe Post piece, which appeared the next day under three other bylines—indicating that\nDeYoung’s interview was hardly the point of the story—contained new leaked details of\nthe Kislyak phone call, which the Post now said had indeed dealt with the issue of\nsanctions. The article also contained Flynn’s denial—“he twice said ‘no’ ”—as well as his\nwalk-back: “On Thursday, Flynn, through his spokesman, backed away from the denial.\nThe spokesman said Flynn ‘indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing\nsanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.’ ”\nAfter the Post story, Priebus and Bannon questioned Flynn again. Flynn professed not\nto remember what he had said; if the subject of sanctions came up, he told them, it was at\nmost glossed over. Curiously, no one seemed to have actually heard the conversation with\nKislyak or seen a transcript.\nMeanwhile, the vice president’s people, caught unaware by the sudden Flynn\ncontroversy, were taking particular umbrage, less about Flynn’s possible\nmisrepresentations than about the fact that they had been kept out of the loop. But the\npresident was undisturbed—or, in one version, “aggressively defensive”—and, while the\ngreater White House looked on askance, Trump chose to take Flynn with him to Mar-a-\nLago for his scheduled weekend with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister.\nThat Saturday night, in a bizarre spectacle, the Mar-a-Lago terrace became a public\nSituation Room when President Trump and Prime Minister Abe openly discussed how to\nrespond to North Korea’s launch of a missile three hundred miles into the Sea of Japan.\nStanding right over the president’s shoulder was Michael Flynn. If Bannon, Priebus, and\nKushner believed that Flynn’s fate hung in the balance, the president seemed to have no\nsuch doubts.\nFor the senior White House staff, the underlying concern was less about getting rid of\nFlynn than about the president’s relationship with Flynn. What had Flynn, in essence a spy\nin a soldier’s uniform, roped the president into? What might they have got up to together?\nOn Monday morning, Kellyanne Conway appeared on MSNBC and offered a firm\ndefense of the National Security Advisor. “Yes,” she said, “General Flynn does enjoy the\nfull confidence of the president.” And while this seemed to many an indication that\nConway was out of the loop, it was more accurately an indication that she had been\ntalking directly to the president.\nA White House meeting that morning failed to convince Trump to fire Flynn. He was\nconcerned about what it would look like to lose his National Security Advisor after just\ntwenty-four days. And he was adamant about not wanting to blame Flynn for talking to\nthe Russians, even about sanctions. In Trump’s view, condemning his adviser would\nconnect him to a plot where there was no plot. His fury wasn’t directed toward Flynn but\nto the “incidental” wiretap that had surveilled him. Making clear his confidence in his\nadviser, Trump insisted that Flynn come to Monday’s lunch with the Canadian prime\nminister, Justin Trudeau.\nLunch was followed by another meeting about the furor. There were yet more details of\nthe phone call and a growing itemization of the money Flynn had been paid by various\nRussian entities; there was also increasing focus on the theory that the leaks from the intel\ncommunity—that is, the whole Russia mess—was directed at Flynn. Finally, there was a\nnew rationale that Flynn should be fired not because of his Russian contacts, but because\nhe had lied about them to the vice president. This was a convenient invention of a chain of\ncommand: in fact, Flynn did not report to Vice President Pence, and he was arguably a\ngood deal more powerful than Pence.\nThe new rationale appealed to Trump, and he at last agreed that Flynn had to go.\nStill, the president did not waiver in his belief in Flynn. Rather, Flynn’s enemies were\nhis enemies. And Russia was a gun to his head. He might, however ruefully, have had to\nfire Flynn, but Flynn was still his guy.\nFlynn, ejected from the White House, had become the first established direct link\nbetween Trump and Russia. And depending on what he might say to whom, he was now\npotentially the most powerful person in Washington.\n8\nORG CHART\nT\nhe White House, realized former naval officer Steve Bannon after a few weeks, was\nreally a military base, a government-issue office with a mansion’s façade and a few\nceremonial rooms sitting on top of a secure installation under military command. The\njuxtaposition was striking: military hierarchy and order in the background, the chaos of\nthe temporary civilian occupants in the fore.\nYou could hardly find an entity more at odds with military discipline than a Trump\norganization. There was no real up-and-down structure, but merely a figure at the top and\nthen everyone else scrambling for his attention. It wasn’t task-based so much as responseoriented—whatever\ncaptured the boss’s attention focused everybody’s attention. That was\nthe way in Trump Tower, just as it was now the way in the Trump White House.\nThe Oval Office itself had been used by prior occupants as the ultimate power symbol,\na ceremonial climax. But as soon as Trump arrived, he moved in a collection of battle\nflags to frame him sitting at his desk, and the Oval immediately became the scene of a\ndaily Trump cluster-fuck. It’s likely that more people had easy access to this president than\nany president before. Nearly all meetings in the Oval with the president were invariably\nsurrounded and interrupted by a long list of retainers—indeed, everybody strove to be in\nevery meeting. Furtive people skulked around without clear purpose: Bannon invariably\nfound some reason to study papers in the corner and then to have a last word; Priebus kept\nhis eye on Bannon; Kushner kept constant tabs on the whereabouts of the others. Trump\nliked to keep Hicks, Conway, and, often, his old Apprentice sidekick Omarosa Manigault\n—now with a confounding White House title—in constant hovering presence. As always,\nTrump wanted an eager audience, encouraging as many people as possible to make as\nmany attempts as possible to be as close to him as possible. In time, however, he would\ntake derisive notice of those who seemed most eager to suck up to him.\nGood management reduces ego. But in the Trump White House, it could often seem\nthat nothing happened, that reality simply did not exist, if it did not happen in Trump’s\npresence. This made an upside-down kind of sense: if something happened and he wasn’t\npresent, he didn’t care about it and barely recognized it. His response then was often just a\nblank stare. It also fed one theory of why hiring in the West Wing and throughout the\nexecutive branch was so slow—filling out the vast bureaucracy was out of his view and\nthus he couldn’t care less. Likewise, visitors with appointments were befuddled by the\nWest Wing’s own lack of staff: after being greeted with a smart military salute by the dress\nmarine at the West Wing door, they discovered that the West Wing often lacked a politicalappointee\nreceptionist, leaving guests to find their own way through the warren that was\nthe Western world’s pinnacle of power.\nTrump, a former military academy cadet—albeit not an enthusiastic one—had touted a\nreturn to military values and expertise. In fact, he most of all sought to preserve his\npersonal right to defy or ignore his own organization. This, too, made sense, since not\nreally having an organization was the most efficient way to sidestep the people in your\norganization and to dominate them. It was just one irony of his courtship of admired\nmilitary figures like James Mattis, H. R. McMaster, and John Kelly: they found\nthemselves working in an administration that was in every way inimical to basic command\nprinciples.\n* * *\nAlmost from the beginning, the West Wing was run against the near-daily report that the\nperson charged with running it, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, was about to lose his job.\nOr, if he was not about to lose his job, the only reason he was keeping it was that he had\nnot had it long enough to yet be fired from it. But no one in Trump’s inner circle doubted\nthat he would lose his job as soon as, practically speaking, his losing it would not\nembarrass the president too much. So, they reasoned, no one need pay any attention to\nhim. Priebus, who, during the transition, doubted he would make it to the inauguration,\nand then, once in, wondered if he could endure the torture for the minimally respectable\nperiod of a year, shortly reduced his goal to six months.\nThe president himself, absent any organizational rigor, often acted as his own chief of\nstaff, or, in a sense, elevated the press secretary job to the primary staff job, and then\nfunctioned as his own press secretary—reviewing press releases, dictating quotes, getting\nreporters on the phone—which left the actual press secretary as a mere flunky and\nwhipping boy. Moreover, his relatives acted as ad hoc general managers of whatever areas\nthey might choose to be general managers in. Then there was Bannon, conducting\nsomething of an alternate-universe operation, often launching far-reaching undertakings\nthat no one else knew about. And thus Priebus, at the center of an operation that had no\ncenter, found it easy to think there was no reason for him to be there at all.\nAt the same time, the president seemed to like Priebus more and more quite for the\nreason that he seemed entirely expendable. He took Trump’s verbal abuse about his height\nand stature affably, or anyway stoically. He was a convenient punching bag when things\nwent wrong—and he didn’t punch back, to Trump’s pleasure and disgust.\n“I love Reince,” said the president, with the faintest praise. “Who else would do this\njob?”\nAmong the three men with effectively equal rank in the West Wing—Priebus and\nBannon and Kushner—only a shared contempt kept them from ganging up on one another.\nIn the early days of Trump’s presidency, the situation seemed clear to everybody: three\nmen were fighting to run the White House, to be the real chief of staff and power behind\nthe Trump throne. And of course there was Trump himself, who didn’t want to relinquish\npower to anyone.\nIn these crosshairs was thirty-two-year-old Katie Walsh.\n* * *\nWalsh, the White House deputy chief of staff, represented, at least to herself, a certain\nRepublican ideal: clean, brisk, orderly, efficient. A righteous bureaucrat, pretty but with a\npermanently grim expression, Walsh was a fine example of the many political\nprofessionals in whom competence and organizational skills transcend ideology. (To wit:\n“I would much rather be part of an organization that has a clear chain of command that I\ndisagree with than a chaotic organization that might seem to better reflect my views.”)\nWalsh was an inside-the-Beltway figure—a swamp creature. Her expertise was\nprioritizing Beltway goals, coordinating Beltway personnel, marshaling Beltway\nresources. A head-down-get-things-done kind of person was how she saw herself. And no\nnonsense.\n“Any time someone goes into a meeting with the president there are like sixty-five\nthings that have to happen first,” she enumerated. “What cabinet secretary has to be\nalerted about what person is going in there; what people on the Hill should be consulted;\nthe president needs a policy briefing, so who’s owning the brief and getting it to\nappropriate staff members, oh and by the way you have to vet the guy… . Then you have\nto give it to comms and figure out if it’s a national story, a regional story and are we doing\nop-eds, going on national TV … and that’s before you get to political affairs or public\nliaison… . And for anybody who meets with the president, it has to be explained why\nother people are not meeting with him, or else they’ll go out there and shit all over the last\nperson who was in… .”\nWalsh was what politics is supposed to be—or what it has been. A business supported\nby, tended to, and, indeed, ennobled, by a professional political class. Politics, evident in\nthe sameness and particular joylessness of Washington dress, a determined anti-fashion\nstatement, is about procedure and temperament. Flash passes. No flash stays in the game.\nFrom an all-girl Catholic school in St. Louis (still wearing a diamond cross around her\nneck) and volunteer work on local political campaigns, Walsh went to George Washington\nUniversity—D.C. area colleges being among the most reliable feeders of swamp talent\n(government is not really an Ivy League profession). Most government and political\norganizations are not run, for better or worse, by MBAs, but by young people\ndistinguished only by their earnestness and public sector idealism and ambition. (It is an\nanomaly of Republican politics that young people motivated to work in the public sector\nfind themselves working to limit the public sector.) Careers advance by how well you\nlearn on the job and how well you get along with the rest of the swamp and play its game.\nIn 2008, Walsh became the McCain campaign’s midwest regional finance director—\nhaving majored in marketing and finance at GW, she was trusted to hold the checkbook.\nThen on to deputy finance director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,\ndeputy finance director and then finance director of the Republican National Committee,\nand finally, pre-White House, chief of staff of the RNC and its chairman, Reince Priebus.\nIn retrospect, the key moment in saving the Trump campaign might be less the Mercerled\ntakeover and imposition of Bannon and Conway in mid-August than the acceptance\nthat the bare-bones and still largely one-man organization would need to depend on the\nlargesse of the RNC. The RNC had the ground game and the data infrastructure; other\ncampaigns might not normally trust the national committee, with its many snakes in the\ngrass, but the Trump campaign had chosen not to build this sort of organization or make\nthis investment. In late August, Bannon and Conway, with Kushner’s consent, made a deal\nwith the deep-swamp RNC despite Trump’s continued insistence that they’d gotten this far\nwithout the RNC, so why come crawling now?\nAlmost right away Walsh became a key player in the campaign, a dedicated, make-thetrains-run-on-time\npower centralizer—a figure without which few organizations can run.\nCommuting between RNC headquarters in Washington and Trump Tower, she was the\nquartermaster who made national political resources available to the campaign.\nIf Trump himself was often a disruption in the final months of the race and during the\ntransition, the campaign around him, in part because its only option was to smoothly\nintegrate with the RNC, was a vastly more responsive and unified organization than, say,\nthe Hillary Clinton campaign with its significantly greater resources. Facing catastrophe\nand seeming certain humiliation, the Trump campaign pulled together—with Priebus,\nBannon, and Kushner all starring in buddy-movie roles.\nThe camaraderie barely survived a few days in the West Wing.\n* * *\nTo Katie Walsh, it became almost immediately clear that the common purpose of the\ncampaign and the urgency of the transition were lost as soon as the Trump team stepped\ninto the White House. They had gone from managing Donald Trump to the expectation of\nbeing managed by him—or at least through him and almost solely for his purposes. Yet\nthe president, while proposing the most radical departure from governing and policy\nnorms in several generations, had few specific ideas about how to turn his themes and\nvitriol into policy, nor a team that could reasonably unite behind him.\nIn most White Houses, policy and action flow down, with staff trying to implement\nwhat the president wants—or, at the very least, what the chief of staff says the president\nwants. In the Trump White House, policy making, from the very first instance of Bannon’s\nimmigration EO, flowed up. It was a process of suggesting, in throw-it-against-the-wall\nstyle, what the president might want, and hoping he might then think that he had thought\nof this himself (a result that was often helped along with the suggestion that he had in fact\nalready had the thought).\nTrump, observed Walsh, had a set of beliefs and impulses, much of them on his mind\nfor many years, some of them fairly contradictory, and little of them fitting legislative or\npolitical conventions or form. Hence, she and everyone else was translating a set of\ndesires and urges into a program, a process that required a lot of guess work. It was, said\nWalsh, “like trying to figure out what a child wants.”\nBut making suggestions was deeply complicated. Here was, arguably, the central issue\nof the Trump presidency, informing every aspect of Trumpian policy and leadership: he\ndidn’t process information in any conventional sense—or, in a way, he didn’t process it at\nall.\nTrump didn’t read. He didn’t really even skim. If it was print, it might as well not exist.\nSome believed that for all practical purposes he was no more than semiliterate. (There was\nsome argument about this, because he could read headlines and articles about himself, or\nat least headlines on articles about himself, and the gossip squibs on the New York Post’s\nPage Six.) Some thought him dyslexic; certainly his comprehension was limited. Others\nconcluded that he didn’t read because he just didn’t have to, and that in fact this was one\nof his key attributes as a populist. He was postliterate—total television.\nBut not only didn’t he read, he didn’t listen. He preferred to be the person talking. And\nhe trusted his own expertise—no matter how paltry or irrelevant—more than anyone\nelse’s. What’s more, he had an extremely short attention span, even when he thought you\nwere worthy of attention.\nThe organization therefore needed a set of internal rationalizations that would allow it\nto trust a man who, while he knew little, was entirely confident of his own gut instincts\nand reflexive opinions, however frequently they might change.\nHere was a key Trump White House rationale: expertise, that liberal virtue, was\noverrated. After all, so often people who had worked hard to know what they knew made\nthe wrong decisions. So maybe the gut was as good, or maybe better, at getting to the heart\nof the matter than the wonkish and data-driven inability to see the forest for the trees that\noften seemed to plague U.S. policy making. Maybe. Hopefully.\nOf course, nobody really believed that, except the president himself.\nStill, here was the basic faith, overriding his impetuousness and eccentricities and\nlimited knowledge base: nobody became the president of the United States—that camel-\nthrough-the-eye-of-the-needle accomplishment—without unique astuteness and cunning.\nRight? In the early days of the White House, this was the fundamental hypothesis of the\nsenior staff, shared by Walsh and everyone else: Trump must know what he was doing, his\nintuition must be profound.\nBut then there was the other aspect of his supposedly superb insight and apprehension,\nand it was hard to miss: he was often confident, but he was just as often paralyzed, less a\nsavant in these instances than a figure of sputtering and dangerous insecurities, whose\ninstinctive response was to lash out and behave as if his gut, however silent and confused,\nwas in fact in some clear and forceful way telling him what to do.\nDuring the campaign, he became a kind of vaunted action figure. His staff marveled at\nhis willingness to keep moving, getting back on the plane and getting off the plane and\ngetting back on, and doing rally after rally, with a pride in doing more events than\nanybody else—double Hillary’s!—and ever ridiculing his opponent’s slow pace. He\nperformed. “This man never takes a break from being Donald Trump,” noted Bannon,\nwith a complicated sort of faint praise, a few weeks after joining the campaign full time.\nIt was during Trump’s early intelligence briefings, held soon after he captured the\nnomination, that alarm signals first went off among his new campaign staff: he seemed to\nlack the ability to take in third-party information. Or maybe he lacked the interest;\nwhichever, he seemed almost phobic about having formal demands on his attention. He\nstonewalled every written page and balked at every explanation. “He’s a guy who really\nhated school,” said Bannon. “And he’s not going to start liking it now.”\nHowever alarming, Trump’s way of operating also presented an opportunity to the\npeople in closest proximity to him: by understanding him, by observing the kind of habits\nand reflexive responses that his business opponents had long learned to use to their\nadvantage, they might be able to game him, to move him. Still, while he might be moved\ntoday, nobody underestimated the complexities of continuing to move him in the same\ndirection tomorrow.\n* * *\nOne of the ways to establish what Trump wanted and where he stood and what his\nunderlying policy intentions were—or at least the intentions that you could convince him\nwere his—came to involve an improbably close textual analysis of his largely off-the-cuff\nspeeches, random remarks, and reflexive tweets during the campaign.\nBannon doggedly went through the Trump oeuvre highlighting possible insights and\npolicy proscriptions. Part of Bannon’s authority in the new White House was as keeper of\nthe Trump promises, meticulously logged onto the white board in his office. Some of these\npromises Trump enthusiastically remembered making, others he had little memory of, but\nwas happy to accept that he had said it. Bannon acted as disciple and promoted Trump to\nguru—or inscrutable God.\nThis devolved into a further rationalization, or Trump truth: “The president was very\nclear on what he wanted to deliver to the American public,” said Walsh. He was “excellent\nin communicating this.” At the same time, she acknowledged that it was not at all clear in\nany specific sense what he wanted. Hence, there was another rationalization: Trump was\n“inspirational not operational.”\nKushner, understanding that Bannon’s white board represented Bannon’s agenda more\nthan the president’s agenda, got to wondering how much of this source text was being\nedited by Bannon. He made several attempts to comb through his father-in-law’s words on\nhis own before expressing frustration with the task and giving up.\nMick Mulvaney, the former South Carolina congressman now head of the Office of\nManagement and Budget and directly charged with creating the Trump budget that would\nunderlie the White House program, also fell back on the Trump spoken record. Bob\nWoodward’s 1994 book, The Agenda, is a blow-by-blow account of the first eighteen\nmonths of the Clinton White House, most of it focused on creating the Clinton budget,\nwith the single largest block of the president’s time devoted to deep contemplation and\narguments about how to allocate resources. In Trump’s case, this sort of close and\ncontinuous engagement was inconceivable; budgeting was simply too small-bore for him.\n“The first couple of times when I went to the White House, someone had to say, This is\nMick Mulvaney, he’s the budget director,” said Mulvaney. And in Mulvaney’s telling\nTrump was too scattershot to ever be of much help, tending to interrupt planning with\nrandom questions that seem to have come from someone’s recent lobbying or by some\nburst of free association. If Trump cared about something, he usually already had a fixed\nview based on limited information. If he didn’t care, he had no view and no information.\nHence, the Trump budget team was also largely forced to return to Trump’s speeches\nwhen searching for the general policy themes they could then fasten into a budget\nprogram.\n* * *\nWalsh, sitting within sight of the Oval Office, was located at something like the ground\nzero of the information flow between the president and his staff. As Trump’s primary\nscheduler, her job was to ration the president’s time and organize the flow of information\nto him around the priorities that the White House had set. In this, Walsh became the\neffective middle person among the three men working hardest to maneuver the president\n—Bannon, Kushner, and Priebus.\nEach man saw the president as something of a blank page—or a scrambled one. And\neach, Walsh came to appreciate with increasing incredulity, had a radically different idea\nof how to fill or remake that page. Bannon was the alt-right militant. Kushner was the\nNew York Democrat. And Priebus was the establishment Republican. “Steve wants to\nforce a million people out of the country and repeal the nation’s health law and lay on a\nbunch of tariffs that will completely decimate how we trade, and Jared wants to deal with\nhuman trafficking and protecting Planned Parenthood.” And Priebus wanted Donald\nTrump to be another kind of Republican altogether.\nAs Walsh saw it, Steve Bannon was running the Steve Bannon White House, Jared\nKushner was running the Michael Bloomberg White House, and Reince Priebus was\nrunning the Paul Ryan White House. It was a 1970s video game, the white ball pinging\nback and forth in the black triangle.\nPriebus—who was supposed to be the weak link, thus allowing both Bannon and\nKushner, variously, to be the effective chief of staff—was actually turning out to be quite a\nbarking dog, even if a small one. In the Bannon world and in the Kushner world,\nTrumpism represented politics with no connection to the Republican mainstream, with\nBannon reviling that mainstream and Kushner operating as a Democrat. Priebus,\nmeanwhile, was the designated mainstream terrier.\nBannon and Kushner were therefore more than a little irritated to discover that the\nunimposing Priebus had an agenda of his own: heeding Senate leader Mitch McConnell’s\nprescription that “this president will sign whatever is put in front of him,” while also\ntaking advantage of the White House’s lack of political and legislative experience and\noutsourcing as much policy as possible to Capitol Hill.\nIn the early weeks of the administration, Priebus arranged for House Speaker Paul\nRyan, however much a Trumpist bête noire for much of the campaign, to come into the\nWhite House with a group of ranking committee chairmen. In the meeting, the president\nblithely announced that he had never had much patience for committees and so was glad\nsomeone else did. Ryan, henceforth, became another figure with unfettered access to the\npresident—and to whom the president, entirely uninterested in legislative strategy or\nprocedures, granted virtual carte blanche.\nAlmost nobody represented what Bannon opposed as well as Paul Ryan. The essence\nof Bannonism (and Mercerism) was a radical isolationism, a protean protectionism, and a\ndetermined Keynesianism. Bannon ascribed these principles to Trumpism, and they ran as\ncounter to Republicanism as it was perhaps possible to get. What’s more, Bannon found\nRyan, in theory the House’s policy whiz, to be slow-witted if not incompetent, and an easy\nand constant target of Bannon’s under-his-breath ridicule. Still, if the president had\nunaccountably embraced Priebus-Ryan, he also could not do without Bannon.\nBannon’s unique ability—partly through becoming more familiar with the president’s\nown words than the president was himself, and partly through a cunning self-effacement\n(upended by his bursts of self-promotion)—was to egg the president on by convincing him\nthat Bannon’s own views were entirely derived from the president’s views. Bannon didn’t\npromote internal debate, provide policy rationale, or deliver Power-Point presentations;\ninstead, he was the equivalent of Trump’s personal talk radio. Trump could turn him on at\nany moment, and it pleased him that Bannon’s pronouncements and views would\nconsistently be fully formed and ever available, a bracing, unified-field narrative. As well,\nhe could turn him off, and Bannon would be tactically quiet until turned on again.\nKushner had neither Bannon’s policy imagination nor Priebus’s institutional ties. But,\nof course, he had family status, carrying its own high authority. In addition, he had\nbillionaire status. He had cultivated a wide range of New York and international money\npeople, Trump acquaintances and cronies, and, often, people whom Trump would have\nwished to like him better than they did. In this, Kushner became the representative in the\nWhite House of the liberal status quo. He was something like what used to be called a\nRockefeller Republican and now might more properly be a Goldman Sachs Democrat. He\n—and, perhaps even more, Ivanka—was at diametric odds with both Priebus, the stoutright,\nSun Belt–leaning, evangelical dependent Republican, and Bannon, the alt-right,\npopulist, anti-party disruptor.\nFrom their separate corners each man pursued his own strategy. Bannon did all he\ncould to roll over Priebus and Kushner in an effort to prosecute the war for\nTrumpism/Bannonism as quickly as possible. Priebus, already complaining about\n“political neophytes and the boss’s relatives,” subcontracted his agenda out to Ryan and\nthe Hill. And Kushner, on one of the steepest learning curves in the history of politics (not\nthat everyone in the White House wasn’t on a steep curve, but Kushner’s was perhaps the\nsteepest), and often exhibiting a painful naïveté as he aspired to be one of the world’s\nsavviest players, was advocating doing nothing fast and everything in moderation. Each\nhad coteries opposed to the other: Bannonites pursued their goal of breaking everything\nfast, Priebus’s RNC faction focused on the opportunities for the Republican agenda,\nKushner and his wife did their best to make their unpredictable relative look temperate\nand rational.\nAnd in the middle was Trump.\n* * *\n“The three gentlemen running things,” as Walsh came to coolly characterize them, all\nserved Trump in different ways. Walsh understood that Bannon provided the president\nwith inspiration and purpose, while the Priebus-Ryan connection promised to do what to\nTrump seemed like the specialized work of government. For his part, Kushner best\ncoordinated the rich men who spoke to Trump at night, with Kushner often urging them to\ncaution him against both Bannon and Priebus.\nThe three advisers were in open conflict by the end of the second week following the\nimmigration EO and travel ban debacle. This internal rivalry was the result of stylistic,\nphilosophic, and temperamental differences; perhaps more important, it was the direct\nresult of the lack of a rational org chart or chain of command. For Walsh, it was a daily\nprocess of managing an impossible task: almost as soon as she received direction from one\nof the three men, she would be countermanded by one or another of them.\n“I take a conversation at face value and move forward with it,” she defended herself. “I\nput what was decided on the schedule and bring in comms and build a press plan around it\nand bring in political affairs and office of public liaison. And then Jared says, Why did\nyou do that. And I say, ‘Because we had a meeting three days ago with you and Reince\nand Steve where you agreed to do this.’ And he says, ‘But that didn’t mean I wanted it on\nthe schedule. That’s not why I had that conversation.’ It almost doesn’t matter what\nanyone says: Jared will agree, and then it will get sabotaged, and then Jared goes to the\npresident and says, See, that was Reince’s idea or Steve’s idea.”\nBannon concentrated on a succession of EOs that would move the new administration\nforward without having to wade through Congress. That focus was countermanded by\nPriebus, who was cultivating the Trump-Ryan romance and the Republican agenda, which\nin turn was countermanded by Kushner, who was concentrating on presidential bonhomie\nand CEO roundtables, not least because he knew how much the president liked them (and,\nas Bannon pointed out, because Kushner himself liked them). And instead of facing the\ninherent conflicts in each strategy, the three men recognized that the conflicts were largely\nirresolvable and avoided facing that fact by avoiding each other.\nEach man had, in his own astute fashion, found his own way to appeal to the president\nand to communicate with him. Bannon offered a rousing fuck-you show of force; Priebus\noffered flattery from the congressional leadership; Kushner offered the approval of bluechip\nbusinessmen. So strong were these particular appeals that the president typically\npreferred not to distinguish among them. They were all exactly what he wanted from the\npresidency, and he didn’t understand why he couldn’t have them all. He wanted to break\nthings, he wanted a Republican Congress to give him bills to sign, and he wanted the love\nand respect of New York machers and socialites. Some inside the White House perceived\nthat Bannon’s EOs were meant to be a workaround in response to Priebus’s courtship of\nthe party, and that Kushner’s CEOs were appalled by Bannon’s EOs and resistant to much\nof the Republican agenda. But if the president understood this, it did not particularly\ntrouble him.\n* * *\nHaving achieved something like executive paralysis within the first month of the new\nadministration—each of the three gentlemen was as powerful in his allure to the president\nas the others and each, at times, was equally annoying to the president—Bannon, Priebus,\nand Kushner all built their own mechanisms to influence the president and undermine the\nothers.\nAnalysis or argument or PowerPoint did not work. But who said what to Trump and\nwhen often did. If, at Bannon’s prodding, Rebekah Mercer called him, that had an effect.\nPriebus could count on Paul Ryan’s clout with him. If Kushner set up Murdoch to call, that\nregistered. At the same time, each successive call mostly canceled the others out.\nThis paralysis led the three advisers to rely on the other particularly effective way to\nmove him, which was to use the media. Hence each man became an inveterate and\npolished leaker. Bannon and Kushner studiously avoided press exposure; two of the most\npowerful people in government were, for the most part, entirely silent, eschewing almost\nall interviews and even the traditional political conversations on Sunday morning\ntelevision. Curiously, however, both men became the background voices to virtually all\nmedia coverage of the White House. Early on, before getting down to attacking each\nother, Bannon and Kushner were united in their separate offensives against Priebus.\nKushner’s preferred outlet was Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski’s Morning Joe, one\nof the president’s certain morning shows. Bannon’s first port of call was the alt-right\nmedia (“Bannon’s Breitbart shenanigans,” in Walsh’s view). By the end of the first month\nin the White House, Bannon and Kushner had each built a network of primary outlets, as\nwell as secondary ones to deflect from the obviousness of the primary ones, creating a\nWhite House that simultaneously displayed extreme animosity toward the press and yet\ngreat willingness to leak to it. In this, at least, Trump’s administration was achieving a\nlandmark transparency.\nThe constant leaking was often blamed on lower minions and permanent executive\nbranch staff, culminating in late February with an all-hands meeting of staffers called by\nSean Spicer—cell phones surrendered at the door—during which the press secretary\nissued threats of random phone checks and admonitions about the use of encrypted texting\napps. Everybody was a potential leaker; everybody was accusing everybody else of being\na leaker.\nEverybody was a leaker.\nOne day, when Kushner accused Walsh of leaking about him, she challenged him back:\n“My phone records versus yours, my email versus yours.”\nBut most of the leaks, certainly the juiciest ones, were coming from the higher-ups—\nnot to mention from the person occupying the topmost echelon.\nThe president couldn’t stop talking. He was plaintive and self-pitying, and it was\nobvious to everyone that if he had a north star, it was just to be liked. He was ever\nuncomprehending about why everyone did not like him, or why it should be so difficult to\nget everyone to like him. He might be happy throughout the day as a parade of union steel\nworkers or CEOs trooped into the White House, with the president praising his visitors\nand them praising him, but that good cheer would sour in the evening after several hours\nof cable television. Then he would get on the phone, and in unguarded ramblings to\nfriends and others, conversations that would routinely last for thirty or forty minutes, and\ncould go much longer, he would vent, largely at the media and his staff. In what was\ntermed by some of the self-appointed Trump experts around him—and everyone was a\nTrump expert—he seemed intent on “poisoning the well,” in which he created a loop of\nsuspicion, disgruntlement, and blame heaped on others.\nWhen the president got on the phone after dinner, it was often a rambling affair. In\nparanoid or sadistic fashion, he’d speculate on the flaws and weaknesses of each member\nof his staff. Bannon was disloyal (not to mention he always looks like shit). Priebus was\nweak (not to mention he was short—a midget). Kushner was a suck-up. Spicer was stupid\n(and looks terrible too). Conway was a crybaby. Jared and Ivanka should never have come\nto Washington.\nHis callers, largely because they found his conversation peculiar, alarming, or\ncompletely contrary to reason and common sense, often overrode what they might\notherwise have assumed to be the confidential nature of the calls and shared the content\nwith someone else. Hence news about the inner workings of the White House went into\nfree circulation. Except it was not so much the inner workings of the White House—\nalthough it would often be reported as such—but the perambulations of the president’s\nmind, which changed direction almost as fast as he could express himself. Yet there were\nconstant tropes in his own narrative: Bannon was about to be cast out, Priebus too, and\nKushner needed his protection from the other bullies.\nSo if Bannon, Priebus, and Kushner were now fighting a daily war with one another, it\nwas mightily exacerbated by something of a running disinformation campaign about them\nthat was being prosecuted by the president himself. A chronic naysayer, he viewed each\nmember of his inner circle as a problem child whose fate he held in his hand. “We are\nsinners and he is God” was one view; “We serve at the president’s displeasure,” another.\n* * *\nIn the West Wing of every administration since at least that of Clinton and Gore, the vice\npresident has occupied a certain independent power base in the organization. And yet Vice\nPresident Mike Pence—the fallback guy in an administration the length of whose term\nremained the subject of something like a national office betting pool—was a cipher, a\nsmiling presence either resisting his own obvious power or unable to seize it.\n“I do funerals and ribbon cuttings,” he told a former Republican Hill colleague. In this,\nhe was seen as either feigning an old-fashioned, what-me-worry, standard-issue veep\nidentity lest he upset his patron or, in fact, honestly acknowledging who he was.\nKatie Walsh, amid the chaos, saw the vice president’s office as a point of calm in the\nstorm. Pence’s staff was not only known by people outside the White House for the\nalacrity with which it returned calls and for the ease with which it seemed to accomplish\nWest Wing tasks, it also seemed to be comprised of people who liked each other and who\nwere dedicated to a common goal: eliminating as much friction as possible around the vice\npresident.\nPence started nearly every speech saying, “I bring greetings from our forty-fifth\npresident of the United States, Donald J. Trump …”—a salutation directed more to the\npresident than to the audience.\nPence cast himself as blandly uninteresting, sometimes barely seeming to exist in the\nshadow of Donald Trump. Little leaked out of the Pence side of the White House. The\npeople who worked for the vice president, were, like Pence himself, people of few words.\nIn a sense, he had solved the riddle of how to serve as the junior partner to a president\nwho could not tolerate any kind of comparisons: extreme self-effacement.\n“Pence,” said Walsh, “is not dumb.”\nActually, well short of intelligent was exactly how others in the West Wing saw him.\nAnd because he wasn’t smart, he was not able to provide any leadership ballast.\nOn the Jarvanka side, Pence became a point of grateful amusement. He was almost\nabsurdly happy to be Donald Trump’s vice president, happy to play the role of exactly the\nkind of vice president that would not ruffle Trump’s feathers. The Jarvanka side credited\nPence’s wife, Karen, as the guiding hand behind his convenient meekness. Indeed, he took\nto this role so well that, later, his extreme submissiveness struck some as suspicious.\nThe Priebus side, where Walsh firmly sat, saw Pence as one of the few senior West\nWing figures who treated Priebus as though he was truly the chief of staff. Pence often\nseemed like a mere staffer, the ever present note taker in so many meetings.\nFrom the Bannon side, Pence garnered only contempt. “Pence is like the husband in\nOzzie and Harriet, a nonevent,” said one Bannonite.\nAlthough many saw him as a vice president who might well assume the presidency\nsomeday, he was also perceived as the weakest vice president in decades and, in\norganizational terms, an empty suit who was useless in the daily effort to help restrain the\npresident and stabilize the West Wing.\n* * *\nDuring that first month, Walsh’s disbelief and even fear about what was happening in the\nWhite House moved her to think about quitting. Every day after that became its own\ncountdown toward the moment she knew she wouldn’t be able to take it anymore—which\nwould finally come at the end of March. To Walsh, the proud political pro, the chaos, the\nrivalries, and the president’s own lack of focus and lack of concern were simply\nincomprehensible.\nIn early March, Walsh confronted Kushner and demanded: “Just give me the three\nthings the president wants to focus on. What are the three priorities of this White House?”\n“Yes,” said Kushner, wholly absent an answer, “we should probably have that\nconversation.”\n9\nCPAC\nO\nn February 23, a 75-degree day in Washington, the president woke up complaining\nabout an overheated White House. But for once, the president’s complaints were not\nthe main concern. The excited focus in the West Wing was organizing a series of car pools\nout to the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of conservative\nmovement activists, which had outgrown the accommodations of Washington hotels and\nmoved to the Gaylord Resort on Maryland’s National Harbor waterfront. CPAC, right of\nright-of-center and trying to hold steady there, ambivalent about all the conservative\nvectors that further diverged from that point, had long had an uncomfortable relationship\nwith Trump, viewing him as an unlikely conservative, if not a charlatan. CPAC, too, saw\nBannon and Breitbart as practicing an outré conservatism. For several years Breitbart had\nstaged a nearby competitive conference dubbed “The Uninvited.”\nBut the Trump White House would dominate or even subsume the conference this year,\nand everybody wanted to turn out for this sweet moment. The president, set to speak on\nthe second day, would, like Ronald Reagan, address the conference in his first year in\noffice, whereas both Bushes, wary of CPAC and conservative activists, had largely\nsnubbed the gathering.\nKellyanne Conway, a conference opener, was accompanied by her assistant, two\ndaughters, and a babysitter. Bannon was making his first official pubic appearance of the\nTrump presidency, and his retinue included Rebekah Mercer, the pivotal Trump donor and\nBreitbart funder, her young daughter, and Allie Hanley, a Palm Beach aristocrat,\nconservative donor, and Mercer friend. (The imperious Hanley, who had not met Bannon\nbefore, pronounced him “dirty” looking.)\nBannon was scheduled to be interviewed in the afternoon session by CPAC chairman\nMatt Schlapp, a figure of strained affability who seemed to be trying to embrace the\nTrump takeover of his conference. A few days before, Bannon had decided to add Priebus\nto the interview, as both a private gesture of goodwill and a public display of unity—a sign\nof a budding alliance against Kushner.\nIn nearby Alexandria, Virginia, Richard Spencer, the president of the National Policy\nInstitute, which is sometimes described as a “white supremacist think tank,” who had,\npeskily for the White House, adopted the Trump presidency as a personal victory, was\norganizing his trip to CPAC, which would be as much a victory march for him as it was\nfor the Trump team. Spencer—who, in 2016, he had declared, “Let’s party like it’s 1933,”\nas in the year Hitler came to power—provoked an outcry with his widely covered “Heil\nTrump” (or “Hail Trump,” which of course amounts to the same thing) salute after the\nelection, and then achieved a kind of reverse martyrdom by taking a punch from a\nprotester on Inauguration Day that was memorialized on YouTube.\nCPAC, organized by the remnants of the conservative movement after Barry\nGoldwater’s apocalyptic defeat in 1964, had, with stoic indefatigability, turned itself into\nthe backbone of conservative survival and triumph. It had purged John Birchers and the\nracist right and embraced the philosophic conservative tenets of Russell Kirk and William\nF. Buckley. In time, it endorsed Reagan-era small government and antiregulatory reform,\nand then added the components of the cultural wars—antiabortion, anti-gay-marriage, and\na tilt toward evangelicals—and married itself to conservative media, first right-wing radio\nand later Fox News. From this agglomeration it spun an ever more elaborate and allembracing\nargument of conservative purity, synchronicity, and intellectual weight. Part of\nthe fun of a CPAC conference, which attracted a wide assortment of conservative young\npeople (reliably mocked as the Alex P. Keaton crowd by the growing throng of liberal\npress that covered the conference), was the learning of the conservative catechism.\nBut after a great Clinton surge in the 1990s, CPAC started to splinter during the George\nW. Bush years. Fox News became the emotional center of American conservativism. Bush\nneocons and the Iraq War were increasingly rejected by the libertarians and other suddenly\nbreakaway factions (among them the paleocons); the family values right, meanwhile, was\nmore and more challenged by younger conservatives. In the Obama years, the\nconservative movement was increasingly bewildered by Tea Party rejectionism and a new\niconoclastic right-wing media, exemplified by Breitbart News, which was pointedly\nexcluded from the CPAC conference.\nIn 2011, professing conservative fealty, Trump lobbied the group for a speaking slot\nand, with reports of a substantial cash contribution, was awarded a fifteen-minute berth. If\nCPAC was supposedly about honing a certain sort of conservative party line, it was also\nattentive to a wide variety of conservative celebrities, including, over the years, Rush\nLimbaugh, Ann Coulter, and various Fox News stars. The year before Obama’s reelection,\nTrump fell into this category. But he was viewed quite differently four years later. In the\nwinter of 2016, during the still competitive Republican primary race, Trump—now eyed\nas much as a Republican apostate as a Republican crowd pleaser—decided to forgo CPAC\nand what he feared would be less than a joyous welcome.\nThis year, as part of its new alignment with the Trump-Bannon White House, CPAC’s\npersonality headliner was slated to be the alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos, a gay British\nright-wing provocateur attached to Breitbart News. Yiannopoulos—whose entire position,\nrather more like a circa-1968 left-wing provocateur, seemed to be about flouting political\ncorrectness and social convention, resulting in left-wing hysteria and protests against him\n—was as confounding a conservative figure as could be imagined. Indeed, there was a\nsubtle suggestion that CPAC had chosen Yiannopoulos precisely to hoist Bannon and the\nWhite House on the implicit connection to him—Yiannopoulos had been something of a\nBannon protégé. When, two days before CPAC opened, a conservative blogger discovered\na video of Yiannopoulos in bizarre revelry seeming to rationalize pedophilia, the White\nHouse made it clear he had to go.\nStill, the White House presence at CPAC—which included, along with the president,\nBannon, Conway, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and the oddball White House foreign\npolicy adviser and former Breitbart writer Sebastian Gorka—seemed to push the\nYiannopoulos mess to the side. If CPAC was always looking to leaven boring politicians\nwith star power, Trump, and anyone connected him, were now the biggest stars. With her\nfamily positioned out in front of a full house, Conway was interviewed in Oprah-like style\nby Mercedes Schlapp (wife of Matt Schlapp—CPAC was a family affair), a columnist for\nthe conservative Washington Times who would later join the White House\ncommunications staff. It was an intimate and inspirational view of a woman of high\nachievement, the kind of interview that Conway believed she would have been treated to\non network and cable television if she were not a Trump Republican—the type of\ntreatment, she’d point out, that had been given to Democratic predecessors like Valerie\nJarrett.\nAt about the time that Conway was explaining her particular brand of antifeminist\nfeminism, Richard Spencer arrived at the convention center hoping to attend the breakout\nsession “The Alt-Right Ain’t Right at All,” a modest effort to reaffirm CPAC’s traditional\nvalues. Spencer, who since the Trump victory had committed himself to full-time activism\nand press opportunities, had planned to position himself to get in the first question. But\nalmost immediately upon arriving and paying his $150 registration fee, he had attracted\nfirst one reporter and then a growing circle, a spontaneous press scrum, and he responded\nby giving an ad hoc news conference. Like Yiannopoulos, and in many ways like Trump\nand Bannon, Spencer helped frame the ironies of the modern conservative movement. He\nwas a racist but hardly a conservative—he doggedly supported single-payer health care,\nfor instance. And the attention he received was somehow less a credit to conservatism than\nanother effort by the liberal media to smear conservatism. Hence, as the scrum around him\nincreased to as many as thirty people, the CPAC irony police stepped in.\n“You’re not welcome on the property,” announced one of the security guards. “They\nwant you off the property. They want you to cease. They want you off the property.”\n“Wow,” said Spencer. “Can they?”\n“Enough debate,” the guard said. “This is private property and CPAC wants you off the\nproperty.”\nRelieved of his credentials, Spencer was ushered to the CPAC perimeter of the hotel,\nwhere, his pride not all that wounded, he turned, in the comfort of the atrium lounge area,\nto social media and to texting and emailing reporters on his contact list.\nThe point Spencer was making was that his presence here was not really so disruptive\nor ironic as Bannon’s, or, for that matter, Trump’s. He might be ejected, but in a larger\nhistorical sense it was the conservatives who were now being ejected from their own\nmovement by the new cadre—which included Trump and Bannon—of what Spencer\ncalled the identitarians, proponents of “white interests, values, customs, and culture.”\nSpencer was, he believed, the true Trumper and the rest of CPAC now the outliers.\n* * *\nIn the green room, after Bannon, Priebus, and their retinues had arrived, Bannon—in dark\nshirt, dark jacket, and white pants—stood off to the side talking to his aide, Alexandra\nPreate. Priebus sat in the makeup chair, patiently receiving a layer of foundation, powder,\nand lip gloss.\n“Steve—” said Priebus, gesturing to the chair as he got up.\n“That’s okay,” said Bannon. He put up his hand, making another of the continual small\ngestures meant, pointedly, to define himself as something other than every phony baloney\nin swampland politics—and something other than Reince Priebus, with his heavy powder\nfoundation.\nThe significance of Bannon’s first appearance in public—after days of apparent West\nWing turmoil, a Time magazine cover story about him, nearly endless speculation about\nhis power and true intentions, and his elevation at least in the media mind to the essential\nmystery of the Trump White House—could hardly be underestimated. For Bannon himself\nthis was, in his own mind, a carefully choreographed moment. It was his victory walk. He\nhad, he thought, prevailed in the West Wing. He had, again in his own mind, projected his\nsuperiority over both Priebus and the idiot son-in-law. And he would now dominate\nCPAC. But for the moment he attempted a shucks-nothing-to-it lack of self-consciousness\neven as, at the same time, he was unquestionably the preening man of the hour. Demurring\nabout accepting makeup was not just a way to belittle Priebus, but also a way to say that,\never the commando, he went into battle fully exposed.\n“You know what he thinks even when you don’t know what he thinks,” explained\nAlexandra Preate. “He’s a bit like a good boy who everybody knows is a bad boy.”\nWhen the two men emerged onto the stage and appeared on the big-screen monitors,\nthe contrast between them could hardly have been greater. The powder made Priebus look\nmannequin-like, and his suit with lapel pin, little-boyish. Bannon, the supposedly\npublicity-shy man, was eating up the camera. He was a country music star—he was\nJohnny Cash. He seized Priebus’s hand in a power handshake, then relaxed in his chair as\nPriebus came too eagerly forward in his.\nPriebus opened with traditional bromides. Bannon, taking his turn, went wryly for the\ndig: “I want to thank you for finally inviting me to CPAC.”\n“We decided to say that everybody is a part of our conservative family,” said Matt\nSchlapp, resigned. He then welcomed “the back of the room,” where the hundreds of\nreporters covering the event were positioned.\n“Is that the opposition party?” asked Bannon, shielding his eyes.\nSchlapp went to the setup question: “We read a lot about you two. Ahem …”\n“It’s all good,” replied Priebus tightly.\n“I’ll bet not all of it’s accurate,” said Schlapp. “I’ll bet there’s things that don’t get\nwritten correctly. Let me ask both of you, what’s the biggest misconception about what’s\ngoing on in the Donald Trump White House?”\nBannon responded with something just less than a smirk and said nothing.\nPriebus offered a testimonial to the closeness of his relationship with Bannon.\nBannon, eyes dancing, lifted the microphone trumpetlike and made a joke about\nPriebus’s commodious office—two couches and a fireplace—and his own rough-andready\none.\nPriebus hewed to the message. “It’s, ahh … it’s actually … something that you all have\nhelped build, which is, when you bring together, and what this election shows, and what\nPresident Trump showed, and let’s not kid ourselves, I can talk about data and ground\ngame and Steve can talk about big ideas but the truth of the matter is Donald Trump,\nPresident Trump, brought together the party and the conservative movement, and I tell you\nif the party and the conservative movement are together”—Priebus knocked his fists\n—“similar to Steve and I, it can’t be stopped. And President Trump is the one guy, he was\nthe one person, and I can say this after overseeing sixteen people kill each other, it was\nDonald Trump who was able to bring this country, this party, and this movement together.\nAnd Steve and I know that and we live it every day and our job is to get the agenda of\nPresident Trump through the door and on pen and paper.”\nWith Priebus gasping for breath, Bannon snatched the relay baton. “I think if you look\nat the opposition party”—throwing his hand out to the back of the room—“and how they\nportrayed the campaign, how they portrayed the transition, and now how they are\nportraying the administration, it’s always wrong. I mean on the very first day that\nKellyanne and I started, we reached out to Reince, Sean Spicer, Katie… . It’s the same\nteam, you know, that every day was grinding away at the campaign, the same team that\ndid the transition, and if you remember, the campaign was the most chaotic, in the media’s\ndescription, most chaotic, most disorganized, most unprofessional, had no earthly idea\nwhat they were doing, and then you saw ’em all crying and weeping that night on\nNovember 8.”\nBack in the White House, Jared Kushner, watching the proceedings casually and then\nmore attentively, suddenly felt a rising anger. Thin-skinned, defensive, on guard, he\nperceived Bannon’s speech as a message sent directly to him. Bannon has just credited the\nTrump victory to everybody else. Kushner was certain he was being taunted.\nWhen Schlapp asked the two men to enumerate the accomplishments of the last thirty\ndays, Priebus floundered and then seized on Judge Gorsuch and the deregulation executive\norders, all things, said Priebus, “that”—he paused, struggling—“eighty percent of\nAmericans agree with.”\nAfter a brief pause, as though waiting for the air to clear, Bannon raised the\nmicrophone: “I kind of break it down into three verticals, three buckets; the first, national\nsecurity and sovereignty, and that’s your intelligence, defense department, homeland\nsecurity. The second line of work is what I refer to as economic nationalism, and that is\nWilbur Ross at Commerce, Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, [Robert] Lighthizer at Trade, Peter\nNavarro, [and] Stephen Miller, who are rethinking how we are going to reconstruct our\ntrade arrangements around the world. The third, broadly, line of work is deconstruction of\nthe administrative state—” Bannon stopped for a moment; the phrase, which had never\nbefore been uttered in American politics, drew wild applause. “The way the progressive\nleft runs is that if they can’t get it passed they’re just going to put it in some sort of\nregulation in an agency. That’s all going to be deconstructed.”\nSchlapp fed another setup question, this one about the media.\nPriebus grabbed it, rambled and fumphered for a while, and ended up, somehow, on a\npositive note: We’ll all come together.\nLifting the microphone, once again Joshua-like, and with a sweeping wave of his hand,\nBannon pronounced, “It’s not only not going to get better, it’s going to get worse every\nday”—his fundamental apocalyptic song—“and here’s why—and by the way, the internal\nlogic makes sense, corporatist, globalist media, that are adamantly opposed, adamantly\nopposed, to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has. And here’s why it’s\ngoing to get worse: because he’s going to continue to press his agenda. And as economic\nconditions continue to get better, as more jobs get better, they’re going to continue to fight.\nIf you think they’re going to give you your country back without a fight you are sadly\nmistaken. Every day it is going to be a fight. This is why I’m proudest of Donald Trump.\nAll the opportunities he had to waver off this. All the people he had coming to him saying\n‘Oh, you got to moderate.’ ” Another dig at Kushner. “Every day in the Oval Office he\ntells Reince and me, ‘I committed this to the American people. I promised this when I ran.\nAnd I’m going to deliver on this.’ ”\nAnd then the final, agreed-upon-beforehand question: “Can this Trump movement be\ncombined with what’s happening at CPAC and other conservative movements for fifty\nyears? Can this be brought together … and is this going to save the country?”\n“Well, we have to stick together as a team,” said Priebus. “It’s gonna take all of us\nworking together to make it happen.”\nAs Bannon started into his answer, he spoke slowly, looking out at his captive and\nriveted audience: “I’ve said that there is a new political order being formed out of this and\nit’s still being formed. If you look at the wide degree of opinions in this room, whether\nyou are a populist, whether you’re a limited-government conservative, whether you’re a\nlibertarian, whether you’re an economic nationalist, we have wide and sometimes\ndivergent opinions, but I think the center core of what we believe, that we’re a nation with\nan economy, not an economy just in some global market place with open borders, but that\nwe are a nation with a culture, and a reason for being. I think that’s what unites us. And\nthat’s what’s going to unite this movement going forward.”\nBannon lowered the microphone to, after what might be interpreted as a beat of\nuncertainty, suddenly thunderous applause.\nWatching from the White House, Kushner—who had come to believe that there was\nsomething insidious when Bannon used the words “borders,” “global,” “culture,” and\n“unite,” and who was more and more convinced that they were personally directed against\nhim—was now in a rage.\n* * *\nKellyanne Conway had increasingly been worrying about the seventy-year-old president’s\nsleeplessness and his worn look. It was the president’s indefatigability—a constant\nrestlessness—that she believed carried the team. On the campaign trail, he would always\nadd stops and speeches. He doubled his own campaign time. Hillary worked at half time;\nhe worked at double time. He sucked in the energy from the crowds. Now that he was\nliving alone in the White House, though, he had seemed to lose a step.\nBut today he was back. He had been under the sunlamp and lightened his hair, and\nwhen the climate-change-denying president woke up on another springlike morning, 77\ndegrees in the middle of winter, on the second day of CPAC, he seemed practically a\ndifferent person, or anyway a noticeably younger one. At the appointed hour, to the\nlocked-down ballroom at the Gaylord Resort, filled to capacity with all stripes of the\nconservative faithful—Rebekah Mercer and her daughter up front—and hundreds of\nmedia people in an SRO gallery, the president emerged onto the stage, not in an energetic\ntelevision-style rush, but with a slow swagger to the low strains of “I’m Proud to Be an\nAmerican.” He came to the stage as a political strongman, a man occupying his moment,\nclapping—here he reverted to entertainer pose—as he slowly approached the podium,\nmouthing “Thank you,” crimson tie dipping over his belt.\nThis would be Trump’s fifth CPAC address. As much as Steve Bannon liked to see\nhimself as the author of Donald Trump, he also seemed to find it proof of some added\nlegitimacy—and somehow amazing in itself—that since 2011 Trump had basically come\nto CPAC with the same message. He wasn’t a cipher, he was a messenger. The country\nwas a “mess”—a word that had stood the Trump test of time. Its leaders were weak. Its\ngreatness had been lost. The only thing different was that in 2011 he was still reading his\nspeeches with only occasional ad-libs, and now he ad-libbed everything.\n“My first major speech was at CPAC,” the president began. “Probably five or six years\nago. My first major political speech. You were there. I loved it. I loved the people. I loved\nthe commotion. They did these polls where I went through the roof. I wasn’t even running,\nright? But it gave me an idea! And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was\nhappening in the country so I said let’s go to it. It was very exciting. I walked the stage at\nCPAC. I had very little notes and even less preparation.” (In fact, he read his 2011 speech\nfrom a sheet of paper.) “So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and\nthen you leave and everybody was thrilled. I said, I think I like this business.”\nThis first preamble gave way to the next preamble.\n“I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It’s phony. Fake. A few\ndays ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources.\nThey just make ’em up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said nine\npeople have confirmed. There are no nine people. I don’t believe there was one or two\npeople. Nine people. And I said, Give me a break. I know the people. I know who they\ntalk to. There were no nine people. But they say nine people… .”\nA few minutes into the forty-eight-minute speech and it was already off the rails, riff\nsustained by repetition.\n“Maybe they’re just bad at polling. Or maybe they’re not legit. It’s one or the other.\nThey’re very smart. They’re very cunning. And they’re very dishonest… . Just to\nconclude”—although he would go on for thirty-seven minutes more—“it’s a very sensitive\ntopic and they get upset when we expose their false stories. They say we can’t criticize\ntheir dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment. You know they always bring\nup”—he went into a falsetto voice—“the First Amendment. Now I love the First\nAmendment. Nobody loves it better than me. Nobody.”\nEach member of the Trump traveling retinue was now maintaining a careful poker face.\nWhen they did break it, it was as though on a delay, given permission by the crowd’s\ncheering or laughter. Otherwise, they seemed not to know whether the president had in\nfact gotten away with his peculiar rambles.\n“By the way, you folks in here, the place is packed, there are lines that go back six\nblocks”—there were no lines outside the crowded lobby—“I tell you that because you\nwon’t read about it. But there are lines that go back six blocks… .\n“There is one allegiance that unites us all, to America, America… . We all salute with\npride the same American flag … and we are all equal, equal in the eyes of Almighty\nGod… . We’re equal … and I want to thank, by the way, the evangelical community, the\nChristian community, communities of faith, rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers,\nbecause the support for me, as you know, was a record, not only numbers of people but\npercentages of those numbers who voted for Trump … an amazing outpouring and I will\nnot disappoint you … as long as we have faith in each other and trust in God then there is\nno goal beyond our reach … there is no dream too large … no task too great … we are\nAmericans and the future belongs to us … America is roaring. It’s going to be bigger and\nbetter and stronger than ever before… .”\nInside the West Wing, some had idly speculated about how long he would go on if he\ncould command time as well as language. The consensus seemed to be forever. The sound\nof his own voice, his lack of inhibition, the fact that linear thought and presentation turned\nout not at all to be necessary, the wonder that this random approach seemed to command,\nand his own replenishing supply of free association—all this suggested that he was limited\nonly by everyone else’s schedule and attention span.\nTrump’s extemporaneous moments were always existential, but more so for his aides\nthan for him. He spoke obliviously and happily, believing himself to be a perfect pitch\nraconteur and public performer, while everyone with him held their breath. If a wackadoo\nmoment occurred on the occasions—the frequent occasions—when his remarks careened\nin no clear direction, his staff had to go into intense method-acting response. It took\nabsolute discipline not to acknowledge what everyone could see.\n* * *\nAs the president finished up his speech, Richard Spencer, who in less than four months\nfrom the Trump election was on his way to becoming the most famous neo-Nazi in\nAmerica since George Lincoln Rockwell, had returned to a seat in the atrium of the\nGaylord Resort to argue his affinity for Donald Trump—and, he believed, vice versa.\nSpencer, curiously, was one of the few people trying to ascribe an intellectual doctrine\nto Trumpism. Between those taking him literally but not seriously, and those taking him\nseriously but not literally, there was Richard Spencer. Practically speaking, he was doing\nboth, arguing the case that if Trump and Bannon were the pilot fish for a new conservative\nmovement, Spencer himself—the owner of altright.com and, he believed, the purest\nexponent of the movement—was their pilot fish, whether they knew it or not.\nAs close to a real-life Nazi as most reporters had ever seen, Spencer was a kind of\ncatnip for the liberal press crowded at CPAC. Arguably, he was offering as good an\nexplanation of Trump’s anomalous politics as anyone else.\nSpencer had come up through writing gigs on conservative publications, but he was\nhardly recognizable in any sort of official Republican or conservative way. He was a postright-wing\nprovocateur but with none of the dinner party waspishness or bite of Ann\nCoulter or Milo Yiannopoulos. They were a stagey type of reactionary. He was a real one\n—a genuine racist with a good education, in his case UVA, the University of Chicago, and\nDuke.\nIt was Bannon who effectively gave Spencer flight by pronouncing Breitbart to be “the\nplatform for the alt-right”—the movement Spencer claimed to have founded, or at least\nowned the domain name for.\n“I don’t think Bannon or Trump are identitarians or alt-rightists,” Spencer explained\nwhile camped out just over CPAC’s property line at the Gaylord. They were not, like\nSpencer, philosophic racists (itself different from a knee-jerk racist). “But they are open to\nthese ideas. And open to the people who are open to these ideas. We’re the spice in the\nmix.”\nSpencer was right. Trump and Bannon, with Sessions in the mix, too, had come closer\nthan any major national politician since the Civil Rights movement to tolerating a racetinged\npolitical view.\n“Trump has said things that conservatives never would have thought… . His criticism\nof the Iraq War, bashing the Bush family, I couldn’t believe he did that … but he did … .\nFuck them … if at the end of the day an Anglo Wasp family produces Jeb and W then\nclearly that’s a clear sign of denegation… . And now they marry Mexicans … Jeb’s wife\n… he married his housekeeper or something.\n“In Trump’s 2011 CPAC address he specifically calls for a relaxation of immigration\nrestrictions for Europeans … that we should re-create an America that was far more stable\nand more beautiful… . No other conservative politician would say those things … but on\nthe other hand pretty much everyone thought it … so it’s powerful to say it… . Clearly\n[there’s] a normalization process going on.”\n“We are the Trump vanguard. The left will say Trump is a nationalist and an implicit or\nquasi-racialist. Conservatives, because they are just so douchey, say Oh, no, of course not,\nhe’s a constitutionalist, or whatever. We on the alt-right will say, He is a nationalist and he\nis a racialist. His movement is a white movement. Duh.”\nLooking very satisfied with himself, Spencer paused and then said: “We give him a\nkind of permission.”\n* * *\nNearby, in the Gaylord atrium, Rebekah Mercer sat having a snack with her homeschooled\ndaughter and her friend and fellow conservative donor Allie Hanley. Both\nwomen agreed that the president’s CPAC speech showed him at his most gracious and\ncharming.\n10\nGQLDMAN\nT\nhe Jarvanka side of the White House increasingly felt that rumors leaked by Bannon\nand his allies were undermining them. Jared and Ivanka, ever eager to enhance their\nstatus as the adults in the room, felt personally wounded by these backdoor attacks.\nKushner, in fact, now believed Bannon would do anything to destroy them. This was\npersonal. After months of defending Bannon against liberal media innuendo, Kushner had\nconcluded that Bannon was an anti-Semite. That was the bottom-line issue. This was a\ncomplicated and frustrating business—and quite hard to communicate to his father-in-law\n—because one of Bannon’s accusations against Kushner, the administration’s point person\non the Middle East, was that he was not nearly tough enough in his defense of Israel.\nAfter the election, the Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson with sly jocularity privately\npointed out to the president that by offhandedly giving the Israel portfolio to his son-inlaw—who\nwould, Trump said, make peace in the Middle East—he hadn’t really done\nKushner any favors.\n“I know,” replied Trump, quite enjoying the joke.\nJews and Israel were a curious Trump subtext. Trump’s brutish father was an often\nvocal anti-Semite. In the split in New York real estate between the Jews and non-Jews, the\nTrumps were clearly on the lesser side. The Jews were white shoe, and Donald Trump,\neven more than his father, was perceived as a vulgarian—after all, he put his name on his\nbuildings, quite a déclassé thing to do. (Ironically, this proved to be a significant advance\nin real estate marketing and, arguably, Trump’s greatest accomplishment as a developer—\nbranding buildings.) But Trump had grown up and built his business in New York, the\nworld’s largest Jewish city. He had made his reputation in the media, that most Jewish of\nindustries, with some keen understanding of media tribal dynamics. His mentor, Roy\nCohn, was a demimonde, semiunderworld, tough-guy Jew. He courted other figures he\nconsidered “tough-guy Jews” (one of his accolades): Carl Icahn, the billionaire hedge\nfunder; Ike Perlmutter, the billionaire investor who had bought and sold Marvel Comics;\nRonald Perelman, the billionaire Revlon chairman; Steven Roth, the New York billionaire\nreal estate tycoon; and Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate. Trump had\nadopted a sort of 1950s Jewish uncle (tough-guy variety) delivery, with assorted\nYiddishisms—Hillary Clinton, he declared, had been “shlonged” in the 2008 primary—\nhelping to give an inarticulate man an unexpected expressiveness. Now his daughter, a de\nfacto First Lady, was, through her conversion, the first Jew in the White House.\nThe Trump campaign and the White House were constantly supplying off-note\nmessages about Jews, from their equivocal regard for David Duke to their apparent desire\nto tinker with Holocaust history—or at least tendency to stumble over it. At one point\nearly in the campaign, Trump’s son-in-law, challenged by his own staff at the New York\nObserver and feeling pressure about his own bona fides, as well as seeking to stand by his\nfather-in-law, wrote an impassioned defense of Trump in an attempt to prove that he was\nnot an anti-Semite. For his efforts, Jared was rebuked by various members of his own\nfamily, who clearly seemed worried about both the direction of Trumpism and Jared’s\nopportunism.\nThere was also the flirtation with European populism. Whenever possible, Trump\nseemed to side with and stoke Europe’s rising right, with its anti-Semitic associations,\npiling on more portent and bad vibes. And then there was Bannon, who had allowed\nhimself to become—through his orchestration of right-wing media themes and stoking of\nliberal outrage—a winking suggestion of anti-Semitism. It was certainly good right-wing\nbusiness to annoy liberal Jews.\nKushner, for his part, was the prepped-out social climber who had rebuffed all\nentreaties in the past to support traditional Jewish organizations. When called upon, the\nbillionaire scion had refused to contribute. Nobody was more perplexed by the sudden rise\nof Jared Kushner to his new position as Israel’s great protector than U.S. Jewish\norganizations. Now, the Jewish great and the good, the venerated and the tried, the\nmandarins and myrmidons, had to pay court to Jared Kushner … who until little more than\na few minutes ago had truly been a nobody.\nFor Trump, giving Israel to Kushner was not only a test, it was a Jewish test: the\npresident was singling him out for being Jewish, rewarding him for being Jewish, saddling\nhim with an impossible hurdle for being Jewish—and, too, defaulting to the stereotyping\nbelief in the negotiating powers of Jews. “Henry Kissinger says Jared is going to be the\nnew Henry Kissinger,” Trump said more than once, rather a combined compliment and\nslur.\nBannon, meanwhile, did not hesitate to ding Kushner on Israel, that peculiar right-wing\nlitmus test. Bannon could bait Jews—globalist, cosmopolitan, Davoscentric liberal Jews\nlike Kushner—because the farther right you were, the more correct you were on Israel.\nNetanyahu was an old Kushner family friend, but when, in the fall, the Israeli prime\nminister came to New York to meet with Trump and Kushner, he made a point of seeking\nout Steve Bannon.\nOn Israel, Bannon had partnered with Sheldon Adelson, titan of Las Vegas, big-check\nright-wing contributor, and, in the president’s mind, quite the toughest tough-guy Jew (that\nis, the richest). Adelson regularly disparaged Kushner’s motives and abilities. The\npresident, to Bannon’s great satisfaction, kept telling his son-in-law, as he strategized on\nIsrael, to check with Sheldon and, hence, Bannon.\nBannon’s effort to grab the stronger-on-Israel label was deeply confounding to\nKushner, who had been raised as an Orthodox Jew. His closest lieutenants in the White\nHouse, Avi Berkowitz and Josh Raffel, were Orthodox Jews. On Friday afternoons, all\nKushner business in the White House stopped before sunset for the Sabbath observance.\nFor Kushner, Bannon’s right-wing defense of Israel, embraced by Trump, somehow\nbecame a jujitsu piece of anti-Semitism aimed directly at him. Bannon seemed determined\nto make Kushner appear weak and inadequate—a cuck, in alt-right speak.\nSo Kushner had struck back, bringing into the White House his own tough-guy Jews—\nGoldman Jews.\n* * *\nKushner had pushed for the then president of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, to run the\nNational Economic Council and to be the president’s chief economic adviser. Bannon’s\nchoice had been CNBC’s conservative anchor and commentator Larry Kudlow. For\nTrump, the Goldman cachet outdrew even a television personality.\nIt was a Richie Rich moment. Kushner had been a summer intern at Goldman when\nCohn was head of commodities trading. Cohn then became president of Goldman in 2006.\nOnce Cohn joined Trump’s team, Kushner often found occasion to mention that the\npresident of Goldman Sachs was working for him. Bannon, depending on whom he\nwanted to slight, either referred to Kushner as Cohn’s intern or pointed out that Cohn was\nnow working for his intern. The president, for his part, was continually pulling Cohn into\nmeetings, especially with foreign leaders, just to introduce him as the former president of\nGoldman Sachs.\nBannon had announced himself as Trump’s brain, a boast that vastly irritated the\npresident. But in Cohn, Kushner saw a better brain for the White House: not only was it\nmuch more politic for Cohn to be Kushner’s brain than Trump’s, but installing Cohn was\nthe perfect countermove to Bannon’s chaos management philosophy. Cohn was the only\nperson in the West Wing who had ever managed a large organization (Goldman has thirtyfive\nthousand employees). And, not to put too fine a point on it—though Kushner was\nhappy to do so—Bannon had rolled out of Goldman having barely reached midlevel\nmanagement status, whereas Cohn, his contemporary, had continued on to the firm’s\nhighest level, making hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. Cohn—a Democrat\nglobalist-cosmopolitan Manhattanite who voted for Hillary Clinton and who still spoke\nfrequently to former Goldman chief and former Democratic New Jersey senator and\ngovernor Jon Corzine—immediately became Bannon’s antithesis.\nFor Bannon, the ideologue, Cohn was the exact inverse, a commodities trader doing\nwhat traders do—read the room and figure out which way the wind is blowing. “Getting\nGary to take a position on something is like nailing butterflies to the wall,” commented\nKatie Walsh.\nCohn started to describe a soon-to-be White House that would be business-focused and\ncommitted to advancing center-right to moderate positions. In this new configuration,\nBannon would be marginalized and Cohn, who was dismissive of Priebus, would be the\nchief of staff in waiting. To Cohn, it seemed like easy street. Of course it would work out\nthis way: Priebus was a lightweight and Bannon a slob who couldn’t run anything.\nWithin weeks of Cohn’s arrival on the transition team, Bannon nixed Cohn’s plan to\nexpand the National Economic Council by as many as thirty people. (Kushner, not to be\ndenied, nixed Bannon’s plan to have David Bossie build and lead his staff.) Bannon also\nretailed the likely not-too-far-off-the-mark view (or, anyway, a popular view inside\nGoldman Sachs) that Cohn, once slated to become Goldman’s CEO, had been forced out\nfor an untoward Haig-like grasping for power—in 1981 then secretary of state Alexander\nHaig had tried to insist he held the power after Ronald Reagan was shot—when Goldman\nCEO Lloyd Blankfein underwent cancer treatment. In the Bannon version, Kushner had\nbought damaged goods. The White House was clearly Cohn’s professional lifeline—why\nelse would he have come into the Trump administration? (Much of this was retailed to\nreporters by Sam Nunberg, the former Trump factotum who was now doing duty for\nBannon. Nunberg was frank about his tactics: “I beat the shit out of Gary whenever\npossible.”)\nIt is a measure of the power of blood (or blood by marriage), and likely the power of\nGoldman Sachs, too, that in the middle of a Republican-controlled Washington and a\nvirulent, if not anti-Semitic (at least toward liberal Jews), right-wing West Wing, the\nKushner-Cohn Democrats appeared to be ascendant. Part of the credit went to Kushner,\nwho showed an unexpected tenacity. Conflict averse—in the Kushner household, his\nfather, monopolizing all the conflict, forced everyone else to be a mollifier—confronting\nneither Bannon nor his father-in-law, he began to see himself in a stoic sense: he was the\nlast man of moderation, the true figure of self-effacement, the necessary ballast of the\nship. This would all be made manifest by a spectacular accomplishment. He would\ncomplete the mission his father-in-law had foisted on him, the one he was more and more\nseeing as his, yes, destiny. He would make peace in the Middle East.\n“He’s going to make peace in the Middle East,” Bannon said often, his voice reverent\nand his expression deadpan, cracking up all the Bannonites.\nSo in one sense Kushner was a figure of heightened foolishness and ridicule. In\nanother, he was a man, encouraged by his wife and by Cohn, who saw himself on the\nworld stage carrying out a singular mission.\nHere was yet another battle to be won or lost. Bannon regarded Kushner and Cohn (and\nIvanka) as occupying an alternative reality that had little bearing on the real Trump\nrevolution. Kushner and Cohn saw Bannon as not just destructive but self-destructive, and\nthey were confident he would destroy himself before he destroyed them.\nIn the Trump White House, observed Henry Kissinger, “it is a war between the Jews\nand the non-Jews.”\n* * *\nFor Dina Powell, the other Goldman hire in the West Wing, the main consideration when\nIvanka pitched her on coming to work at the White House was the downside assessment of\nbeing associated with a Trump presidency. Powell ran the Goldman Sachs philanthropic\narm, a public relations initiative as well as a courtship of the increasingly powerful pools\nof philanthropic money. Representing Goldman, she had become something of a legend at\nDavos, a supreme networker among the world’s supreme networkers. She stood at an\nintersection of image and fortune, in a world increasingly swayed by private wealth and\npersonal brands.\nIt was a function of both her ambition and Ivanka Trump’s sales talents during swift\nmeetings in New York and Washington that Powell, swallowing her doubts, had come on\nboard. That, and the politically risky but high-return gamble that she, aligned with Jared\nand Ivanka, and working closely with Cohn, her Goldman friend and ally, could take over\nthe White House. That was the implicit plan: nothing less. Specifically, the idea was that\nCohn or Powell—and quite possibly both over the course of the next four or eight years—\nwould, as Bannon and Priebus faltered, come to hold the chief of staff job. The president’s\nown constant grumbling about Bannon and Priebus, noted by Ivanka, encouraged this\nscenario.\nThis was no small point: a motivating force behind Powell’s move was the certain\nbelief on the part of Jared and Ivanka (a belief that Cohn and Powell found convincing)\nthat the White House was theirs to take. For Cohn and Powell, the offer to join the Trump\nadministration was transmuted beyond opportunity and became something like duty. It\nwould be their job, working with Jared and Ivanka, to help manage and shape a White\nHouse that might otherwise become the opposite of the reason and moderation they could\nbring. They could be instrumental in saving the place—and, as well, take a quantum\npersonal leap forward.\nMore immediately for Ivanka, who was focused on concerns about women in the\nTrump White House, Powell was an image correction to Kellyanne Conway, whom, quite\napart from their war with Bannon, Ivanka and Jared disdained. Conway, who continued to\nhold the president’s favor and to be his preferred defender on the cable news shows, had\npublicly declared herself the face of the administration—and for Ivanka and Jared, this\nwas a horrifying face. The president’s worst impulses seem to run through Conway\nwithout benefit of a filter. She compounded Trump’s anger, impulsiveness, and miscues.\nWhereas a presidential adviser was supposed to buffer and interpret his gut calls, Conway\nexpressed them, doubled down on them, made opera out of them. She took Trump’s\ndemand for loyalty too literally. In Ivanka and Jared’s view, Conway was a cussed,\nantagonistic, self-dramatizing cable head, and Powell, they hoped, would be a deliberate,\ncircumspect, adult guest on the Sunday morning shows.\nBy late February, after the first helter-skelter month in the West Wing, the campaign by\nJared and Ivanka to undermine Bannon seemed to be working. The couple had created a\nfeedback loop, which included Scarborough and Murdoch, that reinforced the president’s\ndeep annoyance with and frustration about Bannon’s purported importance in the White\nHouse. For weeks after the Time magazine cover story featuring Bannon, there was hardly\na conversation in which Trump didn’t refer to it bitterly. (“He views Time covers as zero\nsum,” said Roger Ailes. “If someone else gets on it, he doesn’t.”) Scarborough, cruelly,\nkept up a constant patter about President Bannon. Murdoch forcefully lectured the\npresident about the oddness and extremism of Bannonism, linking Bannon with Ailes:\n“They’re both crazy,” he told Trump.\nKushner also pressed the view to the president—ever phobic about any age-related\nweakness—that the sixty-three-year-old Bannon wouldn’t hold up under the strain of\nworking in the White House. Indeed, Bannon was working sixteen- and eighteen-hour\ndays, seven days a week, and, for fear of missing a presidential summons or afraid that\nsomeone else might grab it, he considered himself on call pretty much all night. As the\nweeks went by, Bannon seemed physically to deteriorate in front of everybody’s eyes: his\nface became more puffy, his legs more swollen, his eyes more bleary, his clothes more\nslept in, his attention more distracted.\n* * *\nAs Trump’s second month in office began, the Jared-Ivanka-Gary-Dina camp focused on\nthe president’s February 28 speech to the joint session of Congress.\n“Reset,” declared Kushner. “Total reset.”\nThe occasion provided an ideal opportunity. Trump would have to deliver the speech in\nfront of him. It was not only on the teleprompter but distributed widely beforehand.\nWhat’s more, the well-mannered crowd wouldn’t egg him on. His handlers were in\ncontrol. And for this occasion at least, Jared-Ivanka-Gary-Dina were the handlers.\n“Steve will take credit for this speech if there’s even one word of his in it,” Ivanka told\nher father. She knew well that for Trump, credit, much more than content, was the hotbutton\ndriver, and her comment ensured that Trump would keep it out of Bannon’s hands.\n“The Goldman speech,” Bannon called it.\nThe inaugural, largely written by Bannon and Stephen Miller, had shocked Jared and\nIvanka. But a particular peculiarity of the Trump White House, compounding its\nmessaging problems, was its lack of a speech-writing team. There was the literate and\nhighly verbal Bannon, who did not really do any actual writing himself; there was Stephen\nMiller, who did little more than produce bullet points. Beyond that, it was pretty much just\ncatch as catch can. There was a lack of coherent message because there was nobody to\nwrite a coherent message—just one more instance of disregarding political craft.\nIvanka grabbed firm control of the joint session draft and quickly began pulling in\ncontributions from the Jarvanka camp. In the event, the president behaved exactly as they\nhoped. Here was an upbeat Trump, a salesman Trump, a nothing-to-be-afraid-of Trump, a\nhappy-warrior Trump. Jared, Ivanka, and all their allies judged it a magnificent night,\nagreeing that finally, amid the pageantry—Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States\n—the president really did seem presidential. And for once, even the media agreed.\nThe hours following the president’s speech were Trump’s best time in the White\nHouse. It was, for at least one news cycle, a different presidency. For a moment, there was\neven something like a crisis of conscience among parts of the media: Had this president\nbeen grievously misread? Had the media, the biased media, missed well-intentioned\nDonald Trump? Was he finally showing his better nature? The president himself spent\nalmost two full days doing nothing but reviewing his good press. He had arrived, finally,\nat a balmy shore (with appreciative natives on the beach). What’s more, the success of the\nspeech confirmed the Jared and Ivanka strategy: look for common ground. It also\nconfirmed Ivanka’s understanding of her father: he just wanted to be loved. And, likewise,\nit confirmed Bannon’s worst fear: Trump, in his true heart, was a marshmallow.\nThe Trump on view the night of the joint session was not just a new Trump, but a\ndeclaration of a new West Wing brain trust (which Ivanka was making plans to formally\njoin in just a few weeks). Jared and Ivanka, with an assist from their Goldman Sachs\nadvisers, were changing the message, style, and themes of the White House. “Reaching\nout” was the new theme.\nBannon, hardly helping his cause, cast himself as a Cassandra to anyone who would\nlisten. He insisted that only disaster would come from trying to mollify your mortal\nenemies. You need to keep taking the fight to them; you’re fooling yourself if you believe\nthat compromise is possible. The virtue of Donald Trump—the virtue, anyway, of Donald\nTrump to Steve Bannon—was that the cosmopolitan elite was never going to accept him.\nHe was, after all, Donald Trump, however much you shined him up.\n11\nWIRETAP\nW\nith three screens in his White House bedroom, the president was his own best cable\ncurator. But for print he depended on Hope Hicks. Hicks, who had been his junior\naide for most of the campaign and his spokesperson (although, as he would point out, he\nwas really his own spokesperson), had been, many thought, pushed to the sidelines in the\nWest Wing by the Bannonites, the Goldman wing, and the Priebus-RNC professionals. To\nthe senior staff, she seemed not only too young and too inexperienced—she was famous\namong campaign reporters for her hard-to-maneuver-in short skirts—but a way-tooovereager\nyes woman, always in fear of making a mistake, ever tremulously secondguessing\nherself and looking for Trump’s approval. But the president kept rescuing her\n—“Where’s Hope?”—from any oblivion others tried to assign her to. Baffling to almost\neveryone, Hicks remained his closest and most trusted aide, with, perhaps, the single most\nimportant job in this White House: interpreting the media for him in the most positive way\nit could be interpreted, and buffering him from the media that could not be positively\nspun.\nThe day after his “reset” speech before the joint session of Congress presented a certain\nconundrum for Hicks. Here were the first generally good notices for the administration.\nBut in the Post, the Times, and the New Yorker that day, there was also an ugly bouquet of\nvery bad news. Fortunately the three different stories had not quite sunk into cable, so\nthere was yet a brief respite. And at least for the better part of the day, March 1, Hicks\nherself did not entirely seem to grasp how bad the news actually was.\nThe Washington Post’s story was built around a leak from a Justice Department source\n(characterized as a “former senior American official”—hence, most likely someone from\nthe Obama White House) saying that the new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had, on two\noccasions, met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.\nWhen the president was shown the story, he didn’t see its significance. “So what?” he\nsaid.\nWell, during his confirmation, it was explained to the president, Sessions had said he\ndidn’t.\nFacing Sessions at the January 10 hearing, Al Franken, the former comedian and\nDemocratic senator from Minnesota, appeared to be casting blindly for an elusive fish in\nhis efforts to find a question. Stopping and starting, slogging through his sentence\nconstruction, Franken, who had been handed a question based on the just-revealed Steele\ndossier, got to this end:\nThese documents also allegedly say, quote, “There was a continuing exchange of\ninformation during the campaign between Trump’s surrogates and intermediaries\nfor the Russian government.”\nNow, again, I’m telling you this as it’s coming out, so you know. But if it’s true,\nit’s obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated\nwith the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course\nof this campaign, what will you do?\nInstead of answering Franken’s circuitous question—“What will you do?”—with an\neasy “We will of course investigate and pursue any and all illegal actions,” a confused\nSessions answered a question he wasn’t asked.\nSenator Franken, I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a\nsurrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn’t have—did not have\ncommunications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.\nThe president’s immediate focus was on the question of why anyone believed that\ncommunicating with the Russians was bad. There is nothing wrong with that, Trump\ninsisted. As in the past, it was hard to move him off this point and to the issue at hand: a\npossible lie to Congress. The Post story, to the extent that it registered at all, didn’t worry\nhim. Supported by Hicks, he saw it a way-long-shot effort to pin something on Sessions.\nAnd anyway, Sessions was saying he didn’t meet with the Russians as a campaign\nsurrogate. So? He didn’t. Case closed.\n“Fake news,” said the president, using his now all-purpose rejoinder.\nAs for the bad Times story, as Hicks related it to the president, it appeared to him to be\ngood news. Briefed by anonymous sources in the Obama administration (more anonymous\nObama sources), the story revealed a new dimension to the ever growing suggestion of a\nconnection between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to influence the U.S.\nelection:\nAmerican allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information\ndescribing meetings in European cities between Russian officials—and others close\nto Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin—and associates of President-elect Trump,\naccording to three former American officials who requested anonymity in\ndiscussing classified intelligence.\nAnd:\nSeparately, American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of\nRussian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump\nassociates.\nThe story went on:\nMr. Trump has denied that his campaign had any contact with Russian officials, and\nat one point he openly suggested that American spy agencies had cooked up\nintelligence suggesting that the Russian government had tried to meddle in the\npresidential election. Mr. Trump has accused the Obama administration of hyping\nthe Russia story line as a way to discredit his new administration.\nAnd then the real point:\nAt the Obama White House, Mr. Trump’s statements stoked fears among some that\nintelligence could be covered up or destroyed—or its sources exposed—once power\nchanged hands. What followed was a push to preserve the intelligence that\nunderscored the deep anxiety with which the White House and American\nintelligence agencies had come to view the threat from Moscow.\nHere was more confirmation of a central Trump thesis: The previous administration, its\nown candidate defeated, was not just disregarding the democratic custom of smoothing the\nway for the winner of the election; rather, in the Trump White House view, Obama’s\npeople had plotted with the intelligence community to put land mines in the new\nadministration’s way. Secret intelligence was, the story suggested, being widely\ndistributed across intelligence agencies so as to make it easier to leak, and at the same time\nto protect the leakers. This intelligence, it was rumored, consisted of spreadsheets kept by\nSusan Rice that listed the Trump team’s Russian contacts; borrowing a technique from\nWikiLeaks, the documents were secreted on a dozen servers in different places. Before\nthis broad distribution, when the information was held tightly, it would have been easy to\nidentify the small pool of leakers. But the Obama administration had significantly\nexpanded that pool.\nSo this was good news, right? Wasn’t this proof, the president asked, that Obama and\nhis people were out to get him? The Times story was a leak about a plan to leak—and it\nprovided clear evidence of the deep state.\nHope Hicks, as always, supported Trump’s view. The crime was leaking and the culprit\nwas the Obama administration. The Justice Department, the president was confident, was\nnow going to investigate the former president and his people. Finally.\n* * *\nHope Hicks also brought to the president a big piece in the New Yorker. The magazine had\njust published an article by three authors—Evan Osnos, David Remnick, and Joshua Yaffa\n—attributing Russian aggressiveness to a new cold war. Remnick, the editor of the New\nYorker, had, since the Trump election, propounded an absolutist view that Trump’s\nelection imperiled Democratic norms.\nThis 13,500-word story—handily connecting the dots of Russia’s geopolitical\nmortification, Putin’s ambition, the country’s cyber talents, Trump’s own nascent\nauthoritarianism, and the U.S. intelligence community’s suspicions about Putin and Russia\n—codified a new narrative as coherent and as apocalyptic as the one about the old cold\nwar. The difference was that in this one, the ultimate result was Donald Trump—he was\nthe nuclear bomb. One of the frequently quoted sources in the article was Ben Rhodes, the\nObama aide who, Trump’s camp believed, was a key leaker, if not one of the architects of\nthe Obama administration’s continued effort to connect Trump and his team to Putin and\nRussia. Rhodes, many in the White House believed, was the deep state. They also believed\nthat every time a leak was credited to “former and current officials,” Rhodes was the\nformer official who was in close touch with current officials.\nWhile the article was largely just a dire recapitulation of fears about Putin and Trump,\nit did, in a parenthesis toward the end of the article—quite burying the lead—connect\nJared Kushner to Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, in a meeting in Trump Tower with\nMichael Flynn in December.\nHicks missed this point; later, it had to be highlighted for the president by Bannon.\nThree people in the Trump administration—the former National Security Advisor, the\ncurrent attorney general, and the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law—had now been\ndirectly connected to the Russian diplomat.\nTo Kushner and his wife, this was less than innocent: they would, with a sense of\ndeepening threat, suspect Bannon of leaking the information about Kushner’s meeting\nwith Kislyak.\n* * *\nFew jobs in the Trump administration seemed so right, fitting, and even destined to their\nholder as Jeff Sessions’s appointment as the nation’s top law enforcement officer. As he\nviewed his work as AG, it was his mandate to curb, circumscribe, and undo the\ninterpretation of federal law that had for three generations undermined American culture\nand offended his own place in it. “This is his life’s work,” said Steve Bannon.\nAnd Sessions was certainly not going to risk his job over the silly Russia business, with\nits growing collection of slapstick Trump figures. God knows what those characters were\nup to—nothing good, everybody assumed. Best to have nothing to do with it.\nWithout consulting the president or, ostensibly, anyone in the White House, Sessions\ndecided to move as far as possible out of harm’s way. On March 2, the day after the Post\nstory, he recused himself from anything having to do with the Russia investigation.\nThe news of the attorney general’s recusal exploded like an IED in the White House.\nSessions was Trump’s protection against an overly aggressive Russian investigation. The\npresident just could not grasp the logic here. He railed to friends: Why would Sessions not\nwant to protect him? What would Sessions gain? Did he think this stuff was real? Sessions\nneeded to do his job!\nIn fact, Trump already had good reason to worry about the DOJ. The president had a\nprivate source, one of his frequent callers, who, he believed, was keeping him abreast of\nwhat was going on in the Justice Department—and, the president noted, doing a much\nbetter job of it than Sessions himself.\nThe Trump administration, as a consequence of the Russia story, was involved in a\nhigh-stakes bureaucratic push-pull, with the president going outside government to find\nout what was happening in his own government. The source, a longtime friend with his\nown DOJ sources—many of the president’s rich and powerful friends had their own\nreasons to keep close tabs on what was happening at the Justice Department—fed the\npresident a bleak picture of a Justice Department and an FBI run amok in its efforts to get\nhim. “Treason” was a word that was being used, the president was told.\n“The DOJ,” the president’s source told him, “was filled with women who hated him.”\nIt was an army of lawyers and investigators taking instructions from the former\nadministration. “They want to make Watergate look like Pissgate,” the president was told.\nThis comparison confused Trump; he thought his friend was making a reference to the\nSteele dossier and its tale of the golden showers.\nAfter the attorney general’s recusal, the president, whose instinctive reaction to every\nproblem was to fire someone, right away, thought he should just get rid of Sessions. At the\nsame time, there was little doubt in his mind about what was happening here. He knew\nwhere this Russia stuff was coming from, and if these Obama people thought they were\ngoing to get away with it they had another think coming. He would expose them all!\n* * *\nOne of Jared Kushner’s many new patrons was Tony Blair, the former —British prime\nminister, whom Kushner had gotten to know when, on the banks of the River Jordan in\n2010, they both attended the baptism of Grace and Chloe Murdoch, the young daughters\nof Rupert Murdoch and his then wife, Wendi. Jared and Ivanka had also lived in the same\nTrump building on Park Avenue where the Murdochs lived (for the Murdochs it was a\ntemporary rental apartment while their grand triplex on Fifth Avenue was —renovated, but\nthe renovation had lasted for four years), and during that period Ivanka Trump had\nbecome one of Wendi Murdoch’s closest friends. Blair, godfather to Grace, would later be\naccused by Murdoch of having an affair with his wife, and of being the cause of their\nbreakup (something Blair has categorically denied). In the divorce, Wendi got the Trumps.\nBut once in the White House, the president’s daughter and son-in-law became the\ntarget of a renewed and eager cultivation by, with quite some irony, both Blair and\nMurdoch. Lacking a circle of influence in almost all of the many areas of government with\nwhich he was now involved, Kushner was both susceptible to cultivation and more than a\nlittle desperate for the advice his cultivators had to offer. Blair, now with philanthropic,\nprivate diplomatic, and varied business interests in the Middle East, was particularly intent\non helping shepherd some of Jared’s Middle East initiatives.\nIn February, Blair visited Kushner in the White House.\nOn this trip, the now freelance diplomat, perhaps seeking to prove his usefulness to this\nnew White House, mentioned a juicy rumor: the possibility that the British had had the\nTrump campaign staff under surveillance, monitoring its telephone calls and other\ncommunications and possibly even Trump himself. This was, as Kushner might\nunderstand, the Sabbath goy theory of intelligence. On the Sabbath, observant Jews could\nnot turn on the lights, nor ask someone else to turn on the lights. But if they expressed the\nview that it would be much easier to see with light, and if a non-Jew then happened to turn\nthem on, that would be fine. So although the Obama administration would not have asked\nthe British to spy on the Trump campaign, the Brits would have been led to understand\nhow helpful it might be if they did.\nIt was unclear whether the information was rumor, informed conjecture, speculation, or\nsolid stuff. But, as it churned and festered in the president’s mind, Kushner and Bannon\nwent out to CIA headquarters in Langley to meet with Mike Pompeo and his deputy\ndirector Gina Haspel to check it out. A few days later, the CIA opaquely reported back that\nthe information was not correct; it was a “miscommunication.”\n* * *\nPolitics had seemed to become, even well before the age of Trump, a mortal affair. It was\nnow zero-sum: When one side profited, another lost. One side’s victory was another’s\ndeath. The old notion that politics was a trader’s game, an understanding that somebody\nelse had something you wanted—a vote, goodwill, old-fashioned patronage—and that in\nthe end the only issue was cost, had gone out of fashion. Now it was a battle between good\nand evil.\nCuriously, for a man who seemed to have led a movement based in anger and\nretribution, Trump was very much (or believed he was very much) a politician of the old\nstripe—a let’s-work-it-out guy. You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours. He was, in his\nmind, the ultimate tactician, always knowing what the other guy wanted.\nSteve Bannon had pressed him to invoke Andrew Jackson as his populist model, and\nhe had loaded up on Jackson books (they remained unread). But his real beau ideal was\nLyndon Johnson. LBJ was a big man who could knock heads, do deals, and bend lesser\nmen to his will. Trade it out so in the end everyone got something, and the better\ndealmaker got a little more. (Trump did not, however, appreciate the irony of where\nLyndon Johnson ended up—one of the first modern politicians to have found himself on\nthe wrong end of both mortal and moral politics.)\nBut now, after little more than seven weeks in office, Trump saw his own predicament\nas unique and overwhelming. Like no other president before (though he did make some\nallowances for Bill Clinton), his enemies were out to get him. Worse, the system was\nrigged against him. The bureaucratic swamp, the intelligence agencies, the unfair courts,\nthe lying media—they were all lined up against him. This was, for his senior staff, a\nreliable topic of conversation with him: the possible martyrdom of Donald Trump.\nIn the president’s nighttime calls, he kept coming back to how unfair this was, and to\nwhat Tony Blair had said—and others, too! It all added up. There was a plot against him.\nNow, it was certainly true that Trump’s closest staff appreciated his volatility, and, to a\nperson, was alarmed by it. At points on the day’s spectrum of adverse political\ndevelopments, he could have moments of, almost everyone would admit, irrationality.\nWhen that happened, he was alone in his anger and not approachable by anyone. His\nsenior staff largely dealt with these dark hours by agreeing with him, no matter what he\nsaid. And if some of them occasionally tried to hedge, Hope Hicks never did. She agreed\nabsolutely with all of it.\nAt Mar-a-Lago on the evening of March 3, the president watched Bret Baier interview\nPaul Ryan on Fox. Baier asked the Speaker about a report on the online news site Circa—\nowned by Sinclair, the conservative broadcast group—involving allegations that Trump\nTower had been surveilled during the campaign.\nOn March 4, Trump’s early morning tweets began:\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my “wires tapped” in Trump Tower just before the\nvictory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! (4:35 a.m.)\nIs it legal for a sitting President to be “wire tapping” a race for president prior to an election?\nTurned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! (4:49 a.m.)\nHow low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process.\nThis is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! (5:02 a.m.)\nAt 6:40 he called Priebus, waking him up. “Did you see my tweet?” he asked. “We’ve\ncaught them red-handed!” Then the president held his phone so Priebus could hear the\nplayback of the Baier show.\nHe had no interest in precision, or even any ability to be precise. This was pure public\nexclamation, a window into pain and frustration. With his misspellings and his use of\n1970s lingo—“wire tapping” called up an image of FBI agents crouched in a van on Fifth\nAvenue—it seemed kooky and farcical. Of the many tweets that Trump had seemed to\nhoist himself by, from the point of view of the media, intelligence community, and\nextremely satisfied Democrats, the wiretap tweets had pulled him highest and most left\nhim dangling in ignorance and embarrassment.\nAccording to CNN, “Two former senior U.S. officials quickly dismissed Trump’s\naccusations out of hand. ‘Just nonsense,’ said one former senior U.S. intelligence official.”\nInside the White House, the “just nonsense” quote was thought to be from Ben Rhodes,\noffered in cat-that-swallowed-the-canary fashion.\nRyan, for his part, told Priebus he had no idea what Baier was talking about and that he\nwas just BSing through the interview.\nBut if tapping Trump’s phones wasn’t literally true, there was a sudden effort to find\nsomething that might be, and a frantic White House dished up a Breitbart article that\nlinked to a piece by Louise Mensch, a former British politician who, now living in the\nUnited States, had become a kind of conspiracy-central of the Trump-Russia connection.\nThere was a further effort to push aggressive incidental collection and unmasking back\nonto the Obama White House. But in the end, this was another—and to some quite the\nultimate—example of how difficult it was for the president to function in a literal,\ndefinitional, lawyerly, cause-and-effect political world.\nIt was a turning point. Until now, Trump’s inner circle had been mostly game to defend\nhim. But after the wiretap tweets, everybody, save perhaps Hope Hicks, moved into a state\nof queasy sheepishness, if not constant incredulity.\nSean Spicer, for one, kept repeating his daily, if not hourly, mantra: “You can’t make\nthis shit up.”\n12\nREPEAL AND REPLACE\nA\nfew days after the election, Steve Bannon told the president-elect—in what Katie\nWalsh would characterize with a raised eyebrow as more “Breitbart shenanigans”—\nthat they had the votes to replace Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House with Mark Meadows,\nthe head of the Tea Party-inspired Freedom Caucus and an early Trump supporter.\n(Meadows’s wife had a particular place of regard in the Trump camp for continuing a\ncampaign swing across the Bible Belt over Billy Bush weekend.)\nNearly as much as winning the presidency itself, removing Ryan—indeed, humiliating\nhim—was an ultimate expression of what Bannon sought to accomplish and of the mindmeld\nof Bannonism and Trumpism. From the beginning, the Breitbart campaign against\nPaul Ryan was a central part of its campaign for Donald Trump. Its embrace of Trump,\nand Bannon’s personal enlistment in the campaign fourteen months after it began, was in\npart because Trump, throwing political sense to the wind, was willing to lead the charge\nagainst Ryan and the GOP godfathers. Still, there was a difference between the way\nBreitbart viewed Ryan and the way Trump viewed him.\nFor Breitbart, the House rebellion and transformation that had driven the former\nSpeaker, John Boehner, from office, and which, plausibly, was set to remake the House\ninto the center of the new radical Republicanism had been halted by Ryan’s election as\nSpeaker. Mitt Romney’s running mate, and a figure who had merged a conservative fiscal\nwonkishness—he had been the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and,\nas well, chairman of the House Budget Committee—with an old-fashioned idea of\nunassailable Republican rectitude, Ryan was the official last, best hope of the Republican\nParty. (Bannon, typically, had turned this trope into an official Trumpist talking point:\n“Ryan was created in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation.”) If the Republican Party\nhad been moved further right by the Tea Party rebellion, Ryan was part of the ballast that\nwould prevent it from moving further, or at least at a vastly slower pace. In this he\nrepresented an adult, older-brother steadiness in contrast to the Tea Party’s ADD-hyper\nimmaturity—and a stoic, almost martyrlike resistance to the Trump movement.\nWhere the Republican establishment had promoted Ryan into this figure of not only\nmaturity but sagaciousness, the Tea Party-Bannon-Breitbart wing mounted an ad hominem\ncampaign pushing an image of Ryan as uncommitted to the cause, an inept strategist and\nincompetent leader. He was the Tea Party-Bannon-Breitbart punch line: the ultimate empty\nsuit, a hee-haw sort of joke and an embarrassment.\nTrump’s distaste for Ryan was significantly less structural. He had no views about\nRyan’s political abilities, and had paid no real attention to Ryan’s actual positions. His\nview was personal. Ryan had insulted him—again and again. Ryan had kept betting\nagainst him. Ryan had become the effective symbol of the Republican establishment’s\nhorror and disbelief about Trump. Adding insult to injury, Ryan had even achieved some\nmoral stature by dissing Trump (and, as usual, he considered anybody’s gain at his\nexpense a double insult). By the spring of 2016, Ryan was still, and by then the only,\nalternative to Trump as the nominee. Say the word, many Republicans felt, and the\nconvention would stampede to Ryan. But Ryan’s seemingly smarter calculation was to let\nTrump win the nomination, and then to emerge as the obvious figure to lead the party after\nTrump’s historic defeat and the inevitable purge of the Tea Party-Trump-Breitbart wing.\nInstead, the election destroyed Paul Ryan, at least in Steve Bannon’s eyes. Trump had\nnot only saved the Republican Party but had given it a powerful majority. The entire\nBannon dream had been realized. The Tea Party movement, with Trump as its remarkable\nface and voice, had come to power—something like total power. It owned the Republican\nParty. Publicly breaking Paul Ryan was the obvious and necessary step.\nBut a great deal could fall into the chasm between Bannon’s structural contempt for\nRyan and Trump’s personal resentment. If Bannon saw Ryan as being unwilling and\nunable to carry out the new Bannon-Trump agenda, Trump saw a chastened Ryan as\nsuddenly and satisfyingly abject, submissive, and useful. Bannon wanted to get rid of the\nentire Republican establishment; Trump was wholly satisfied that it now seemed to bend\nto him.\n“He’s quite a smart guy,” Trump said after his first postelection conversation with the\nSpeaker. “A very serious man. Everybody respects him.”\nRyan, “rising to a movie-version level of flattery and sucking-up painful to witness,”\naccording to one senior Trump aide, was able to delay his execution. As Bannon pressed\nhis case for Meadows—who was significantly less yielding than Ryan—Trump dithered\nand then finally decided that not only was he not going to push for Ryan’s ouster, but Ryan\nwas going to be his man, his partner. In an example of the odd and unpredictable effects of\npersonal chemistry on Trump—of how easy it can be to sell the salesman—Trump would\nnow eagerly back Ryan’s agenda instead of the other way around.\n“I don’t think that we quite calculated that the president would give him carte blanche,”\nreflected Katie Walsh. “The president and Paul went from such a bad place during the\ncampaign to such a romance afterward that the president was happy to go along with\nwhatever he wanted.”\nIt didn’t exactly surprise Bannon when Trump flipped; Bannon understood how easy it\nwas to bullshit a bullshitter. Bannon also recognized that the Ryan rapprochement spoke to\nTrump’s new appreciation of where he found himself. It was not just that Ryan had been\nwilling to bow to Trump, but that Trump was willing to bow to his own fears about how\nlittle he actually knew about being president. If Ryan could be counted on to handle\nCongress, thought the president, well, phew, that takes care of that.\n* * *\nTrump had little or no interest in the central Republican goal of repealing Obamacare. An\noverweight seventy-year-old man with various physical phobias (for instance, he lied\nabout his height to keep from having a body mass index that would label him as obese), he\npersonally found health care and medical treatments of all kinds a distasteful subject. The\ndetails of the contested legislation were, to him, particularly boring; his attention would\nbegin wandering from the first words of a policy discussion. He would have been able to\nenumerate few of the particulars of Obamacare—other than expressing glee about the silly\nObama pledge that everyone could keep his or her doctor—and he certainly could not\nmake any kind of meaningful distinction, positive or negative, between the health care\nsystem before Obamacare and the one after.\nPrior to his presidency, he had likely never had a meaningful discussion in his life\nabout health insurance. “No one in the country, or on earth, has given less thought to\nhealth insurance than Donald,” said Roger Ailes. Pressed in a campaign interview about\nthe importance of Obamacare repeal and reform, Trump was, to say the least, quite unsure\nof its place on the agenda: “This is an important subject but there are a lot of important\nsubjects. Maybe it is in the top ten. Probably is. But there is heavy competition. So you\ncan’t be certain. Could be twelve. Or could be fifteen. Definitely top twenty for sure.”\nIt was another one of his counterintuitive connections to many voters: Obama and\nHillary Clinton seemed actually to want to talk about health care plans, whereas Trump,\nlike most everybody else, absolutely did not.\nAll things considered, he probably preferred the notion of more people having health\ninsurance than fewer people having it. He was even, when push came to shove, rather\nmore for Obamacare than for repealing Obamacare. As well, he had made a set of rash\nObama-like promises, going so far as to say that under a forthcoming Trumpcare plan (he\nhad to be strongly discouraged from using this kind of rebranding—political wise men\ntold him that this was one instance where he might not want to claim ownership with his\nname), no one would lose their health insurance, and that preexisting conditions would\ncontinue to be covered. In fact, he probably favored government-funded health care more\nthan any other Republican. “Why can’t Medicare simply cover everybody?” he had\nimpatiently wondered aloud during one discussion with aides, all of whom were careful\nnot to react to this heresy.\nIt was Bannon who held the line, insisting, sternly, that Obamacare was a litmus\nRepublican issue, and that, holding a majority in Congress, they could not face Republican\nvoters without having made good on the by now Republican catechism of repeal. Repeal,\nin Bannon’s view, was the pledge, and repeal would be the most satisfying, even cathartic,\nresult. It would also be the easiest one to achieve, since virtually every Republican was\nalready publicly committed to voting for repeal. But Bannon, seeing health care as a weak\nlink in Bannonism-Trumpism’s appeal to the workingman, was careful to take a back seat\nin the debate. Later, he hardly even made an effort to rationalize how he’d washed his\nhands of the mess, saying just, “I hung back on health care because it’s not my thing.”\nIt was Ryan who, with “repeal and replace,” obfuscated the issue and won over Trump.\nRepeal would satisfy the Republican bottom line, while replace would satisfy the\notherwise off-the-cuff pledges that Trump had made on his own. (Pay no attention to the\nlikelihood that what the president construed as repeal and replace might be very different\nfrom what Ryan construed as repeal and replace.) “Repeal and replace” was a useful\nslogan, too, in that it came to have meaning without having any actual or specific\nmeaning.\nThe week after the election, Ryan, bringing Tom Price—the Georgia congressman and\northopedist who had become Ryan’s resident heath care expert—traveled to Trump’s\nBedminster, New Jersey, estate for a repeal and replace briefing. The two men summed up\nfor Trump—who kept wandering off topic and trying to turn the conversation to golf—\nseven years of Republican legislative thinking about Obamacare and the Republican\nalternatives. Here was a perfect example of an essential Trump paradigm: he acceded to\nanyone who seemed to know more about any issue he didn’t care about, or simply one\nwhose details he couldn’t bring himself to focus on closely. Great! he would say,\npunctuating every statement with a similar exclamation and regularly making an effort to\njump from his chair. On the spot, Trump eagerly agreed to let Ryan run the health care bill\nand to make Price the Health and Human Services secretary.\nKushner, largely staying silent during the health care debate, publicly seemed to accept\nthe fact that a Republican administration had to address Obamacare, but he privately\nsuggested that he was personally against both repeal alone and repeal and replace. He and\nhis wife took a conventional Democratic view on Obamacare (it was better than the\nalternatives; its problems could be fixed in the future) and strategically believed it was\nbest for the new administration to get some easier victories under its belt before entering a\nhard-to-win or no-win fight. (What’s more, Kushner’s brother Josh ran a health insurance\ncompany that depended on Obamacare.)\nNot for the last time, then, the White House would be divided along the political\nspectrum, Bannon taking an absolutist base position, Priebus aligned with Ryan in support\nof the Republican leadership, and Kushner maintaining, and seeing no contradiction in, a\nmoderate Democratic view. As for Trump himself, here was a man who was simply trying\nto get out from under something he didn’t especially care about.\nRyan and Priebus’s salesmanship promised to get the president out from under other\nissues as well. Health care reform, according to the Ryan plan, was something of a magic\nbullet. The reform the Speaker would push through Congress would fund the tax cuts\nTrump had guaranteed, which, in turn, would make all that Trump-promised infrastructure\ninvestment possible.\nOn this basis—this domino theory that was meant to triumphantly carry the Trump\nadministration through to the August recess and mark it as one of the most\ntransformational presidencies in modern times—Ryan kept his job as Speaker, rising from\nhated campaign symbol to the administration’s man on the Hill. In effect, the president,\nquite aware of his and his staff’s inexperience in drafting legislation (in fact, nobody on\nhis senior staff had any experience at all), decided to outsource his agenda—and to a\nheretofore archenemy.\nWatching Ryan steal the legislative initiative during the transition, Bannon faced an\nearly realpolitik moment. If the president was willing to cede major initiatives, Bannon\nwould need to run a counteroperation and be ready with more Breitbart shenanigans.\nKushner, for his part, developed a certain Zen—you just had to go with the president’s\nwhims. As for the president, it was quite clear that deciding between contradictory policy\napproaches was not his style of leadership. He simply hoped that difficult decisions would\nmake themselves.\n* * *\nBannon was not merely contemptuous of Ryan’s ideology; he had no respect, either, for\nhis craft. In Bannon’s view, what the new Republican majority needed was a man like\nJohn McCormick, the Democratic Speaker of the House who had served during Bannon’s\nteenage years and had shepherded Johnson’s Great Society legislation. McCormick and\nother Democrats from the 1960s were Bannon’s political heroes—put Tip O’Neill in that\npantheon, too. An Irish Catholic working-class man was philosophically separate from\naristocrats and gentry—and without aspirations to be either. Bannon venerated oldfashioned\npols. He looked like one himself: liver spots, jowls, edema. And he hated\nmodern politicians; they lacked, in addition to political talents, authenticity and soul. Ryan\nwas an Irish Catholic altar boy who had stayed an altar boy. He had not grown up to be a\nthug, cop, or priest—or a true politician.\nRyan certainly wasn’t a vote counter. He was a benighted figure who had no ability to\nsee around corners. His heart was in tax reform, but as far as he could tell the only path to\ntax reform was through health care. But he cared so little about the issue that—just as the\nWhite House had outsourced health care to him—he outsourced the writing of the bill to\ninsurance companies and K Street lobbyists.\nIn fact, Ryan had tried to act like McCormick or O’Neill, offering absolute assurances\nof his hold on the legislation. It was, he told the president during his several daily calls, a\n“done deal.” Trump’s trust in Ryan rose still higher, and it seemed to become in his own\nmind proof that he had achieved a kind of mastery over the Hill. If the president had been\nworried, he was worried no more. Done deal. The White House, having had to sweat\nhardly at all, was about to get a big victory, bragged Kushner, embracing the expected win\nover his dislike of the bill.\nThe sudden concern that the outcome might be otherwise began in early March. Katie\nWalsh, who Kushner now described as “demanding and petulant,” began to sound the\nalarm. But her efforts to personally involve the president in vote collecting were blocked\nby Kushner in a set of increasingly tense face-offs. The unraveling had begun.\n* * *\nTrump still dismissively called it “the Russian thing—a whole lot of nothing.” But on\nMarch 20, FBI director James Comey appeared before the House Intelligence Committee\nand tied the story up in a neat package:\nI have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part\nof our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts\nto interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the\nnature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and\nthe Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the\ncampaign and Russia’s efforts. As with any counter intelligence investigation, this\nwill also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. Because it\nis an open, ongoing investigation and is classified I cannot say more about what we\nare doing and whose conduct we are examining.\nHe had, however, said quite enough. Comey converted rumor, leaks, theory, innuendo,\nand pundit hot air—and until this moment that was all there was, at best the hope of a\nscandal—into a formal pursuit of the White House. Efforts to pooh-pooh the narrative—\nthe fake news label, the president’s germaphobe defense against the golden shower\naccusations, the haughty dismissal of minor associates and hopeless hangers-on, the\nplaintive, if real, insistence that no crime had even been alleged, and the president’s charge\nthat he was the victim of an Obama wiretap—had failed. Comey himself dismissed the\nwiretap allegation. By the evening of Comey’s appearance, it was evident to everyone that\nthe Russia plot line, far from petering out, had a mighty and bloody life to come.\nKushner, ever mindful of his father’s collision with the Justice Department, was\nespecially agitated by Comey’s increasing focus on the White House. Doing something\nabout Comey became a Kushner theme. What can we do about him? was a constant\nquestion. And it was one he kept raising with the president.\nYet this was also—as Bannon, without too much internal success, tried to explain—a\nstructural issue. It was an opposition move. You could express surprise at how fierce,\ncreative, and diabolical the moves turned out to be, but you shouldn’t be surprised that\nyour enemies would try to hurt you. This was check, but far from checkmate, and you had\nto continue to play the game, knowing that it would be a very long one. The only way to\nwin the game, Bannon argued, was with a disciplined strategy.\nBut the president, prodded here by his family, was an obsessive and not a strategist. In\nhis mind, this was not a problem to address, this was a person to focus on: Comey. Trump\neschewed abstractions and, ad hominem, zeroed in on his opponent. Comey had been a\ndifficult puzzle for Trump: Comey had declined to have the FBI pursue charges against\nClinton for her email dodge. Then, in October, Comey had single-handedly boosted\nTrump’s fortunes with the letter reopening the Clinton email investigation.\nIn their personal interactions, Trump had found Comey to be a stiff—he had no banter,\nno game. But Trump, who invariably thought people found him irresistible, believed that\nComey admired his banter and game. When pressed, by Bannon and others, to fire Comey\nas one of his early acts—an idea opposed by Kushner, and thus another bullet on Bannon’s\nlist of bad recommendations by Kushner—the president said, “Don’t worry, I’ve got him.”\nThat is, he had no doubt that he could woo and flatter the FBI director into positive feeling\nfor him, if not outright submission.\nSome seducers are preternaturally sensitive to the signals of those they try to seduce;\nothers indiscriminately attempt to seduce, and, by the law of averages, often succeed (this\nlatter group of men might now be regarded as harassers). That was Trump’s approach to\nwomen—pleased when he scored, unconcerned when he didn’t (and, often, despite the\nevidence, believing that he had). And so it was with Director Comey.\nIn their several meetings since he took office—when Comey received a presidential\nhug on January 22; at their dinner on January 27, during which Comey was asked to stay\non as FBI director; at their Valentine’s Day chat after emptying the office of everybody\nelse, including Sessions, Comey’s titular boss—Trump was confident that he had laid on\nthe moves. The president was all but certain that Comey, understanding that he, Trump,\nhad his back (i.e., had let him keep his job), would have Trump’s back, too.\nBut now this testimony. It made no sense. What did make sense to Trump was that\nComey wanted it to be about him. He was a media whore—this Trump understood. All\nright, then, he, too, could play it this way.\nIndeed, health care, a no-fun issue—suddenly becoming much less fun, if, as seemed\nincreasingly possible, Ryan couldn’t deliver—palled before the clarity of Comey, and the\nfury, enmity, and bitterness Trump, and Trump’s relatives, now bore him.\nComey was the larger-than-life problem. Taking Comey down was the obvious\nsolution. Getting Comey became the mission.\nIn Keystone Cops fashion, the White House enlisted House Intelligence Committee\nchairman Devin Nunes in a farcical effort to discredit Comey and support the wiretap\ntheory. The scheme shortly collapsed in universal ridicule.\nBannon, taking a public hands-off with respect to both health care and Comey, began\nto advise reporters that the important story wasn’t health care but Russia. This was cryptic\nadvice: it was not clear whether he was trying to distract attention from the coming health\ncare debacle, or couple it with this new dangerous variable, thus amping up the kind of\nchaos that he usually benefited from.\nBut Bannon was unequivocal about one thing. As the Russia story unfolds, he advised\nreporters, keep your eye on Kushner.\n* * *\nBy mid-March, Gary Cohn had been drafted into the effort to salvage the faltering health\ncare bill. This might have seemed like a form of hazing for Cohn, whose grasp of\nlegislative matters was even more limited than that of most in the White House.\nOn Friday, March 24, the morning of the theoretical House vote for the Republican\nhealth care bill, Politico’s Playbook characterized the chances of a vote actually coming to\nthe floor as a “toss-up.” In that morning’s senior staff meeting, Cohn was asked for an\nassessment of where things stood and promptly said, “I think it’s a toss-up.”\n“Really?” thought Katie Walsh. “That’s what you think?”\nBannon, joining Walsh in a pitiless contempt for the White House effort, targeted\nKushner, Cohn, Priebus, Price, and Ryan in a series of calls to reporters. Kushner and\nCohn could, per Bannon, be counted on to run at the first sound of gunfire. (Kushner, in\nfact, had spent much of the week on a skiing holiday.) Priebus mouthed Ryan talking\npoints and excuses. Price, supposedly the health care guru, was an oafish imposter; he\nwould stand up in meetings and mumble nothing but nonsense.\nThese were the bad guys, setting up the administration to lose the House in 2018,\nthereby assuring the president’s impeachment. This was vintage Bannon analysis: a certain\nand immediate political apocalypse that sat side by side with the potential for a half\ncentury of Bannonism-Trumpism rule.\nConvinced he knew the direction of success, keenly aware of his own age and finite\nopportunities, and—if for no clear reason—seeing himself as a talented political infighter,\nBannon sought to draw the line between believers and sell-outs, being and nothingness.\nFor him to succeed, he needed to isolate the Ryan, Cohn, and Kushner factions.\nThe Bannon faction held tight on forcing a vote on the health care bill—even knowing\ndefeat was inevitable. “I want it as a report on Ryan’s job as Speaker,” said Bannon. That\nis, a devastating report, an epic fail.\nThe day of the vote, Pence was sent to the Hill to make one last pitch to Meadows’s\nFreedom Caucus. (Ryan’s people believed that Bannon was secretly urging Meadows to\nhold out, though earlier in the week Bannon had harshly ordered the Freedom Caucus to\nvote for the bill—“a silly Bannon show,” according to Walsh.) At three-thirty, Ryan called\nthe president to say he was short fifteen to twenty votes and needed to pull the vote.\nBannon, backed by Mulvaney, who had become the White House’s Hill operative,\ncontinued to urge an immediate vote. A defeat here would be a major defeat for the\nRepublican leadership. That suited Bannon just fine: let them fail.\nBut the president backed down. Faced with this singular opportunity to make the\nRepublican leadership the issue, and to name them as the problem, Trump wobbled,\nprovoking in Bannon a not-so-silent rage. Ryan then leaked that it was the president who\nhad asked him to cancel the vote.\nOver the weekend, Bannon called a long list of reporters and told them—off the record,\nbut hardly—“I don’t see Ryan hanging around a long time.”\n* * *\nAfter the bill had been pulled that Friday, Katie Walsh, feeling both angry and disgusted,\ntold Kushner she wanted out. Outlining what she saw as the grim debacle of the Trump\nWhite House, she spoke with harsh candor about bitter rivalries joined to vast\nincompetence and an uncertain mission. Kushner, understanding that she needed to be\ndiscredited immediately, leaked that she had been leaking and hence had to be pushed out.\nOn Sunday evening, Walsh had dinner with Bannon in his Capitol Hill redoubt, the\nBreitbart Embassy, during which, to no avail, he implored her to stay. On Monday she\nsorted out the details with Priebus—she would leave to work part time for the RNC and\npart time for the Trump (c)(4), the outside campaign group. By Thursday she was gone.\nTen weeks into the new administration, the Trump White House had lost, after Michael\nFlynn, its second senior staff member—and the one whose job it was to actually get things\ndone.\n13\nBANNON AGONISTES\nH\ne, too, felt like a prisoner, he had told Katie Walsh when she came to tell him she\nwas leaving.\nBy ten weeks in, Steve Bannon’s mastery of the Trump agenda, or at least of Trump\nhimself, appeared to have crumbled. His current misery was both Catholic in nature—the\nself-flagellation of a man who believed he lived on a higher moral plane than all others—\nand fundamentally misanthropic. As an antisocial, maladjusted, post-middle-aged man, he\nhad to make a supreme effort to get along with others, an effort that often did not go well.\nMost especially, he was miserable because of Donald Trump, whose cruelties, always\ngreat even when they were casual, were unbearable when he truly turned against you.\n“I hated being on the campaign, I hated the transition, I hate being here in the White\nHouse,” said Bannon, sitting one evening in Reince Priebus’s office, on an unseasonably\nwarm evening in early spring, with the French doors open to the arbor-covered patio\nwhere he and Priebus, now firm friends and allies in their antipathy toward Jarvanka, had\nset an outdoor table.\nBut Bannon was, he believed, here for a reason. And it was his firm belief—a belief he\nwas unable to keep to himself, thus continually undermining his standing with the\npresident—that his efforts had brought everybody else here. Even more important, he was\nthe only person showing up for work every day who was committed to the purpose of\nactually changing the country. Changing it quickly, radically, and truly.\nThe idea of a split electorate—of blue and red states, of two opposing currents of\nvalues, of globalists and nationalists, of an establishment and populist revolt—was media\nshorthand for cultural angst and politically roiled times, and, to a large degree, for\nbusiness as usual. But Bannon believed the split was literal. The United States had become\na country of two hostile peoples. One would necessarily win and the other lose. Or one\nwould dominate while the other would become marginal.\nThis was modern civil war—Bannon’s war. The country built on the virtue and the\ncharacter and the strength of the American workingman circa 1955–65 was the ideal he\nmeant to defend and restore: trade agreements, or trade wars, that supported American\nmanufacturing; immigration policies that protected American workers (and, hence,\nAmerican culture, or at least America’s identity from 1955 to 1965); and an international\nisolation that would conserve American resources and choke off the ruling class’s Davos\nsensibility (and also save working-class military lives). This was, in the view of almost\neveryone but Donald Trump and the alt-right, a crazy bit of voodoo economic and political\nnonsense. But it was, for Bannon, a revolutionary and religious idea.\nFor most others in the White House, it was Bannon’s pipe dream. “Steve is … Steve,”\nbecame the gentle term of art for tolerating him. “A lot of stuff goes on in his head,” said\nthe president, pursuing one of his reliable conversational themes, dismissing Bannon.\nBut it wasn’t Bannon versus everybody else so much as it was Bannon Trump versus\nnon-Bannon Trump. If Trump, in his dark, determined, and aggressive mood, could\nrepresent Bannon and his views, he could just as easily represent nothing at all—or\nrepresent solely his own need for instant gratification. That’s what the non-Bannon people\nunderstood about Trump. If the boss was happy, then a normal, incremental, two-stepsforward-one-step-back\napproach to politics might prevail. Even a new sort of centrism, as\ninimical to Bannonism as it was possible to conceive, could emerge. Bannon’s\npronouncements about a fifty-year rule for Trumpism might then be supplanted by the rule\nof Jared, Ivanka, and Goldman Sachs.\nBy the end of March, this was the side that was winning. Bannon’s efforts to use the\nepic health care fail as evidence that the establishment was the enemy had hopelessly\nbackfired. Trump saw the health care failure as his own failure, but since he didn’t have\nfailures, it couldn’t be a failure, and would in fact be a success—if not now, soon. So\nBannon, a Cassandra on the sidelines, was the problem.\nTrump rationalized his early embrace of Bannon by heaping scorn on him—and by\ndenying that he had ever embraced him. If there was anything wrong with his White\nHouse, it was Steve Bannon. Maligning Bannon was Trump’s idea of fun. When it came to\nBannon, Trump rose to something like high analysis: “Steve Bannon’s problem is PR. He\ndoesn’t understand it. Everybody hates him. Because … look at him. His bad PR rubs off\non other people.”\nThe real question, of course, was how Bannon, the fuck-the-system populist, had ever\ncome to think that he might get along with Donald Trump, the use-the-system-to-his-ownadvantage\nbillionaire. For Bannon, Trump was the game he had to play. But in truth he\nhardly played it—or couldn’t help undermining it. While ever proclaiming it Trump’s\nvictory, he would helplessly point out that when he had joined the campaign it was facing\na polling deficit that no campaign, ten weeks from election day, had ever recovered from.\nTrump without Bannon, according to Bannon, was Wendell Willkie.\nBannon understood the necessity not to take what otherwise might be Trump’s own\nspotlight; he was well aware that the president meticulously logged all claims against\ncredit that he believed solely to be his. Both he and Kushner, the two most important\nfigures in the White House after the president, seemed professionally mute. Still, Bannon\nseemed to be everywhere, and the president was convinced—rightly—that it was the result\nof Bannon’s private press operation. More often than self-mockery could sustain, Bannon\nreferred to himself as “President Bannon.” A bitter Kellyanne Conway, regularly dissed\nfor her own spotlight grabbing, confirmed the president’s observation that Bannon stepped\ninto as many White House photo ops as possible. (Everybody seemed to keep count of\neverybody else’s photo bombs.) Bannon also did not much bother to disguise his\ninnumerable blind quotes, nor to make much of an effort to temper his not-so-private slurs\nagainst Kushner, Cohn, Powell, Conway, Priebus, and even the president’s daughter\n(often, most especially, the president’s daughter).\nCuriously, Bannon never expressed a sideways thought about Trump—not yet.\nTrump’s own righteousness and soundness was perhaps too central to Bannon’s construct\nof Trumpism. Trump was the idea you had to support. This could seem to approach the\ntraditional idea of respecting the office. In fact, it was the inverse. The man was the vessel:\nthere was no Bannon without Trump. However much he might stand on his unique, even\nmagical-seeming, contributions to the Trump victory, Bannon’s opportunity was wholly\nprovided by Trump’s peculiar talent. He was no more than the man behind the man—\nTrump’s Cromwell, as he put it, even though he was perfectly aware of Cromwell’s fate.\nBut his loyalty to the idea of Trump hardly protected him from the actual Trump’s\nconstant briefs against him. The president had assembled a wide jury to weigh Bannon’s\nfate, putting before it, in an insulting Borscht Belt style, a long list of Bannon’s\nannoyances: “Guy looks homeless. Take a shower, Steve. You’ve worn those pants for six\ndays. He says he’s made money, I don’t believe it.” (The president, notably, never much\ntook issue with Bannon’s policy views.) The Trump administration was hardly two months\nold, yet every media outlet was predicting Bannon’s coming defenestration.\nOne particularly profitable transaction with the president was to bring him new, ever\nharsher criticism of his chief strategist, or reports of other people criticizing him. It was\nimportant to know not to say anything positive to Trump about Bannon. Even faint praise\nbefore the “but”—“Steve is obviously smart, but …”—could produce a scowl and pout if\nyou didn’t hurry to the “but.” (Then again, saying anyone was “smart” invariably incurred\nTrump’s annoyance.) Kushner enlisted Scarborough and Brzezinski in something of a\nregular morning television Bannon slag-a-thon.\nH. R. McMaster, the three-star general who had replaced Michael Flynn as National\nSecurity Advisor, had secured the president’s pledge that he could veto members of the\nNSC. Kushner, a supporter of McMaster’s appointment, had quickly ensured that Dina\nPowell, a key player in the Kushner faction, would join the NSC and Bannon would be\nremoved.\nBannonites would, with lowered voices and certain pity, ask each other how he seemed\nand how he was holding up; invariably they would agree about how bad he looked, the\nstrain etching ever deeper into his already ruined face. David Bossie thought Bannon\n“looked like he would die.”\n“I now understand what it is like to be in the court of the Tudors,” reflected Bannon.\nOn the campaign trail, he recalled, Newt Gingrich “would come with all these dumb ideas.\nWhen we won he was my new best friend. Every day a hundred ideas. When”—by spring\nin the White House—“I got cold, when I went through my Valley of Death, I saw him one\nday in the lobby and he looks down, avoiding my eyes with a kind of mumbled ‘Hey,\nSteve.’ And I say, ‘What are you doing here, let’s get you inside,’ and he says, ‘No, no,\nI’m fine, I’m waiting for Dina Powell.’ ”\nHaving attained the unimaginable—bringing a fierce alt-right, anti-liberal\nethnopopulism into a central place in the White House—Bannon found himself face to\nface with the untenable: undermined by and having to answer to rich, entitled Democrats.\n* * *\nThe paradox of the Trump presidency was that it was both the most ideologically driven\nand the least. It represented a deeply structural assault on liberal values—Bannon’s\ndeconstruction of the administrative state meant to take with it media, academic, and notfor-profit\ninstitutions. But from the start it also was apparent that the Trump administration\ncould just as easily turn into a country club Republican or a Wall Street Democrat regime.\nOr just a constant effort to keep Donald Trump happy. Trump had his collection of petpeeve\nissues, test-marketed in various media rollouts and megarallies, but none seemed so\nsignificant as his greater goal of personally coming out ahead of the game.\nAs the drumbeat for Bannon’s removal grew, the Mercers stepped in to protect their\ninvestment in radical government overthrow and the future of Steve Bannon.\nIn an age when all successful political candidates are surrounded by, if not at the beck\nand call of, difficult, rich people pushing the bounds of their own power—and the richer\nthey were, the more difficult they might be—Bob and Rebekah Mercer were quite onto\nthemselves. If Trump’s ascent was unlikely, the Mercers’ was all the more so.\nEven the difficult rich—the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson on the right, David\nGeffen and George Soros on the left—are leavened and restrained by the fact that money\nexists in a competitive market. Obnoxiousness has its limits. The world of the rich is, in its\nfashion, self-regulating. Social climbing has rules.\nBut among the difficult and entitled rich, the Mercers cut a path through disbelief and\nincredulity. Unlike other people contributing vast sums to political candidates, they were\nwilling not to win—ever. Their bubble was their bubble.\nSo when they did win, by the fluke alignment of the stars for Donald Trump, they were\nyet pure. Now, having found themselves—by odds that were perfect-storm outlandish—in\npower, they were not going to give it up because Steve Bannon had hurt feelings and\nwasn’t getting enough sleep.\nToward the end of March, the Mercers organized a set of emergency meetings. At least\none of them was with the president himself. It was exactly the kind of meeting Trump\nusually avoided: he had no interest in personnel problems, since they put the emphasis on\nother people. Suddenly he was being forced to deal with Steve Bannon, rather than the\nother way around. What’s more, it was a problem he had in part created with his constant\nBannon dissing, and now he was being asked to eat crow. Even though the president kept\nsaying he could and should fire Bannon, he was aware of the costs—a right-wing backlash\nof unpredictable proportions.\nTrump thought the Mercers were super-strange bedfellows too. He didn’t like Bob\nMercer looking at him and not saying a word; he didn’t like being in the same room with\nMercer or his daughter. But though he refused to admit that the Mercers’ decision to back\nhim and their imposition of Bannon on the campaign in August was, likely, the event\nwithout which he would not now be in the White House, he did understand that if crossed,\nthe Mercers and Bannon were potential world-class troublemakers.\nThe complexity of the Bannon-Mercer problem prompted Trump to consult two\ncontradictory figures: Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes. Even as the president did so,\nperhaps he knew he would come up with a zero-sum answer.\nMurdoch, already briefed by Kushner, said getting rid of Bannon was the only way to\ndeal with the dysfunction in the White House. (Murdoch, of course, made the assumption\nthat getting rid of Kushner was not an option.) It was the inevitable outcome, so do it now.\nMurdoch’s response made perfect sense: by now, he had become an active political\nsupporter of the Kushner-Goldman moderates, seeing them as the people who would save\nthe world from Bannon and, indeed, from Trump as well.\nAiles, blunt and declarative as always, said, “Donald, you can’t do it. You’ve made\nyour bed and Steve is in it. You don’t have to listen to him, you don’t have to even get\nalong with him. But you’re married to him. You can’t handle a divorce right now.”\nJared and Ivanka were gleeful at the prospect of Bannon’s ouster. His departure would\nreturn the Trump organization to pure family control—the family and its functionaries,\nwithout an internal rival for brand meaning and leadership. From the family’s point of\nview, it would also—at least in theory—help facilitate one of the most implausible brand\nshifts in history: Donald Trump to respectability. The dream, long differed, of the Trump\npivot, might actually happen without Bannon. Never mind that this Kushner ideal—saving\nTrump from himself and projecting Jared and Ivanka into the future—was nearly as farfetched\nand extreme as Bannon’s own fantasy of a White House dedicated to the return of\na pre-1965 American mythology.\nIf Bannon were to go, it also might cause the ultimate split in the already fractured\nRepublican Party. Before the election, one theory suggested that a defeated Trump would\ntake his embittered 35 percent and make hay with a rancorous minority. Now the alarming\ntheory was that as Kushner tried to transform his father-in-law into the kind of latter-day\nRockefeller that Trump, however implausibly, had on occasion dreamed of becoming\n(Rockefeller Center being an inspiration for his own real estate branding), Bannon could\nrun off with some meaningful part of that 35 percent.\nThis was the Breitbart threat. The Breitbart organization remained under the control of\nthe Mercers, and it could at any moment be handed back to Steve Bannon. And now, with\nBannon’s overnight transformation into political genius and kingmaker, and the triumph of\nthe alt-right, Breitbart was potentially much more powerful. Trump’s victory had, in some\nsense, handed the Mercers the tool with which to destroy him. As push came to shove and\nthe mainstream media and swamp bureaucracy more and more militantly organized\nagainst him, Trump was certainly going to need the Mercer-backed alt-right standing up in\nhis defense. What, after all, was he without them?\nAs the pressure mounted, Bannon—until now absolutely disciplined in his regard for\nDonald Trump as the ideal avatar of Trumpism (and Bannonism), rigidly staying in\ncharacter as aide and supporter of a maverick political talent—began to crack. Trump, as\nalmost anyone who had ever worked for him appreciated, was, despite what you hoped he\nmight be, Trump—and he would invariably sour on everyone around him.\nBut the Mercers dug in. Without Bannon, they believed the Trump presidency, at least\nthe Trump presidency they had imagined (and helped pay for), was over. The focus\nbecame how to make Steve’s life better. They made him pledge to leave the office at a\nreasonable time—no more waiting around for Trump to possibly need a dinner\ncompanion. (Recently, Jared and Ivanka had been heading this off anyway.) The solution\nincluded a search for a Bannon’s Bannon—a chief strategist for the chief strategist.\nIn late March, the Mercers came to an agreed-upon truce with the president: Bannon\nwould not be fired. While this guaranteed nothing about his influence and standing, it did\nbuy Bannon and his allies some time. They could regroup. A presidential aide was only as\ngood as the last good advice he gave, and in this, Bannon believed the ineptness of his\nrivals, Kushner and his wife, would seal their fate.\n* * *\nThough the president agreed not to fire Bannon, he gave Kushner and his daughter\nsomething in exchange: he would enhance both their roles.\nOn March 27, the Office of American Innovation was created and Kushner was put in\ncharge. Its stated mission was to reduce federal bureaucracy—that is, to reduce it by\ncreating more of it, a committee to end committees. In addition, Kushner’s new outfit\nwould study the government’s internal technology, focus on job creation, encourage and\nsuggest policies about apprenticeships, enlist business in a partnership with government,\nand help with the opioid epidemic. It was, in other words, business as usual, albeit with a\nnew burst of enthusiasm for the administrative state.\nBut its real import was that it gave Kushner his own internal White House staff, a team\nof people working not just on Kushner-supported projects—all largely antithetical to\nBannon projects—but, more broadly, as Kushner explained to one staffer, “on expanding\nmy footprint.” Kushner even got his own “comms person,” a dedicated spokesperson and\nKushner promoter. It was a bureaucratic build-out meant not only to enhance Kushner but\nto diminish Steve Bannon.\nTwo days after the announcement about Jared’s expanded power base, Ivanka was\nformally given a White House job, too: adviser to the president. From the beginning she\nhad been a key adviser to her husband—and he to her. Still, it was an overnight\nconsolidation of Trump family power in the White House. It was, quite at Steve Bannon’s\nexpense, a remarkable bureaucratic coup: a divided White House had now all but been\nunited under the president’s family.\nHis son-in-law and daughter hoped—they were even confident—that they could speak\nto DJT’s better self, or at least balance Republican needs with progressive rationality,\ncompassion, and good works. Further, they could support this moderation by routing a\nsteady stream of like-minded CEOs through the Oval Office. And, indeed, the president\nseldom disagreed with and was often enthusiastic about the Jared and Ivanka program. “If\nthey tell him the whales need to be saved, he’s basically for it,” noted Katie Walsh.\nBut Bannon, suffering in his internal exile, remained convinced that he represented\nwhat Donald Trump actually believed, or, more accurately, what the president felt. He\nknew Trump to be a fundamentally emotional man, and he was certain that the deepest\npart of him was angry and dark. However much the president wanted to support his\ndaughter and her husband’s aspirations, their worldview was not his. As Walsh saw it,\n“Steve believes he is Darth Vader and that Trump is called to the dark side.”\nIndeed, Trump’s fierce efforts to deny Bannon’s influence may well have been in\ninverse proportion to the influence Bannon actually had.\nThe president did not truly listen to anybody. The more you talked, the less he listened.\n“But Steve is careful about what he says, and there is something, a timbre in his voice and\nhis energy and excitement, that the president can really hone in on, blocking everything\nelse out,” said Walsh.\nAs Jared and Ivanka were taking a victory lap, Trump signed Executive Order 13783, a\nchange in environmental policy carefully shepherded by Bannon, which, he argued,\neffectively gutted the National Environmental Policy Act, the 1970 law that served as the\nfoundation of modern environmental protections and that required all executive agencies\nto prepare environmental impact statements for agency actions. Among other impacts, EO\n13783 removed a prior directive to consider climate change—a precursor to coming\ndebates on the country’s position regarding the Paris Climate Accord.\nOn April 3, Kushner unexpectedly turned up in Iraq, accompanying Gen. Joseph\nDunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to the White House press office,\nKushner was “traveling on behalf of the president to express the president’s support and\ncommitment to the government of Iraq and U.S. personnel currently engaged in the\ncampaign.” Kushner, otherwise a remote and clammed-up media presence, was copiously\nphotographed throughout the trip.\nBannon, watching one of the many television screens that provided a constant\nbackground in the West Wing, glimpsed Kushner wearing a headset while flying in a\nhelicopter over Baghdad. To no one in particular, recalling a foolish and callow George W.\nBush in flight gear on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln proclaiming the end of the\nIraq War, he intoned, “Mission accomplished.”\nGritting his teeth, Bannon saw the structure of the White House moving in the exact\nopposite direction from Trumpism-Bannonism. But even now, he was certain he perceived\nthe real impulses of the administration coming his way. It was Bannon, stoic and resolute,\nthe great if unheralded warrior, who, at least in his own mind, was destined to save the\nnation.\n14\nSITUATION ROOM\nJ\nust before seven o’clock on the morning of Tuesday, April 4, the seventy-fourth day of\nthe Trump presidency, Syrian government forces attacked the rebel-held town of Khan\nSheikhoun with chemical weapons. Scores of children were killed. It was the first time a\nmajor outside event had intruded into the Trump presidency.\nMost presidencies are shaped by external crises. The presidency, in its most critical\nrole, is a reactive job. Much of the alarm about Donald Trump came from the widespread\nconviction that he could not be counted on to be cool or deliberate in the face of a storm.\nHe had been lucky so far: ten weeks in, and he had not been seriously tested. In part this\nmight have been because the crises generated from inside the White House had\novershadowed all outside contenders.\nEven a gruesome attack, even one on children in an already long war, might not yet be\na presidential game changer of the kind that everyone knew would surely come. Still,\nthese were chemical weapons launched by a repeat offender, Bashar al-Assad. In any other\npresidency, such an atrocity would command a considered and, ideally, skillful response.\nObama’s consideration had in fact been less than skillful in proclaiming the use of\nchemical weapons as a red line—and then allowing it to be crossed.\nAlmost nobody in the Trump administration was willing to predict how the president\nmight react—or even whether he would react. Did he think the chemical attack important\nor unimportant? No one could say.\nIf the Trump White House was as unsettling as any in American history, the president’s\nviews of foreign policy and the world at large were among its most random, uninformed,\nand seemingly capricious aspects. His advisers didn’t know whether he was an isolationist\nor a militarist, or whether he could distinguish between the two. He was enamored with\ngenerals and determined that people with military command experience take the lead in\nforeign policy, but he hated to be told what to do. He was against nation building, but he\nbelieved there were few situations that he couldn’t personally make better. He had little to\nno experience in foreign policy, but he had no respect for the experts, either.\nSuddenly, the question of how the president might respond to the attack in Khan\nSheikhoun was a litmus test for normality and those who hoped to represent it in Trump’s\nWhite House. Here was the kind of dramatic juxtaposition that might make for a vivid and\nefficient piece of theater: people working in the Trump White House who were trying to\nbehave normally.\n* * *\nSurprisingly, perhaps, there were quite a few such people.\nActing normal, embodying normality—doing things the way a striving, achieving,\nrational person would do them—was how Dina Powell saw her job in the White House. At\nforty-three, Powell had made a career at the intersection of the corporate world and public\npolicy; she did well (very, very well) by doing good. She had made great strides in George\nW. Bush’s White House and then later at Goldman Sachs. Returning to the White House at\na penultimate level, with at least a chance of rising to one of the country’s highest\nunelected positions, would potentially be worth enormous sums when she returned to the\ncorporate world.\nIn Trumpland, however, the exact opposite could happen. Powell’s carefully cultivated\nreputation, her brand (and she was one of those people who thought intently about their\npersonal brand), could become inextricably tied to the Trump brand. Worse, she could\nbecome part of what might easily turn into historical calamity. Already, for many people\nwho knew Dina Powell—and everybody who was anybody knew Dina Powell—the fact\nthat she had taken a position in the Trump White House indicated either recklessness or\nseriously bad judgment.\n“How,” wondered one of her longtime friends, “does she rationalize this?” Friends,\nfamily, and neighbors asked, silently or openly, Do you know what you’re doing? And how\ncould you? And why would you?\nHere was the line dividing those whose reason for being in the White House was a\nprofessed loyalty to the president from the professionals they had needed to hire. Bannon,\nConway, and Hicks—along with an assortment of more or less peculiar ideologues that\nhad attached themselves to Trump and, of course, his family, all people without clearly\nmonetizable reputations before their association with Trump—were, for better or worse,\nhitched to him. (Even among dedicated Trumpers there was always a certain amount of\nholding their breath and constant reexamination of their options.) But those within the\nlarger circle of White House influence, those with some stature or at least an imagined\nstature, had to work through significantly more complicated contortions of personal and\ncareer justification.\nOften they wore their qualms on their sleeves. Mick Mulvaney, the OMB director,\nmade a point of stressing the fact that he worked in the Executive Office Building, not the\nWest Wing. Michael Anton, holding down Ben Rhodes’s former job at the NSC, had\nperfected a deft eye roll (referred to as the Anton eye roll). H. R. McMaster seemed to\nwear a constant grimace and have perpetual steam rising from his bald head. (“What’s\nwrong with him?” the president often asked.)\nThere was, of course, a higher rationale: the White House needed normal, sane, logical,\nadult professionals. To a person, these pros saw themselves bringing positive attributes—\nrational minds, analytic powers, significant professional experience—to a situation sorely\nlacking those things. They were doing their bit to make things more normal and, therefore,\nmore stable. They were bulwarks, or saw themselves that way, against chaos,\nimpulsiveness, and stupidity. They were less Trump supporters than an antidote to Trump.\n“If it all starts going south—more south than it is already going—I have no doubt that\nJoe Hagin would himself take personal responsibility, and do what needed to be done,”\nsaid a senior Republican figure in Washington, in an effort at self-reassurance, about the\nformer Bush staffer who now served as Trump’s deputy chief of staff for operations.\nBut this sense of duty and virtue involved a complicated calculation about your\npositive effect on the White House versus its negative effect on you. In April, an email\noriginally copied to more than a dozen people went into far wider circulation when it was\nforwarded and reforwarded. Purporting to represent the views of Gary Cohn and quite\nsuccinctly summarizing the appalled sense in much of the White House, the email read:\nIt’s worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won’t read\nanything—not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up\nhalfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. And his staff is\nno better. Kushner is an entitled baby who knows nothing. Bannon is an arrogant\nprick who thinks he’s smarter than he is. Trump is less a person than a collection of\nterrible traits. No one will survive the first year but his family. I hate the work, but\nfeel I need to stay because I’m the only person there with a clue what he’s doing.\nThe reason so few jobs have been filled is that they only accept people who pass\nridiculous purity tests, even for midlevel policy-making jobs where the people will\nnever see the light of day. I am in a constant state of shock and horror.\nStill, the mess that might do serious damage to the nation, and, by association, to your\nown brand, might be transcended if you were seen as the person, by dint of competence\nand professional behavior, taking control of it.\nPowell, who had come into the White House as an adviser to Ivanka Trump, rose, in\nweeks, to a position on the National Security Council, and was then, suddenly, along with\nCohn, her Goldman colleague, a contender for some of the highest posts in the\nadministration.\nAt the same time, both she and Cohn were spending a good deal of time with their ad\nhoc outside advisers on which way they might jump out of the White House. Powell could\neye seven-figure comms jobs at various Fortune 100 companies, or a C-suite future at a\ntech company—Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg, after all, had a background in corporate\nphilanthropy and in the Obama administration. Cohn, on his part, already a\ncentamillionaire, was thinking about the World Bank or the Fed.\nIvanka Trump—dealing with some of the same personal and career considerations as\nPowell, except without a viable escape strategy—was quite in her own corner.\nInexpressive and even botlike in public but, among friends, discursive and strategic,\nIvanka had become both more defensive about her father and more alarmed by where his\nWhite House was heading. She and her husband blamed this on Bannon and his let-\nTrump-be-Trump philosophy (often interpreted as let Trump be Bannon). The couple had\ncome to regard him as more diabolical than Rasputin. Hence it was their job to keep\nBannon and the ideologues from the president, who, they believed, was, in his heart, a\npractical-minded person (at least in his better moods), swayed only by people preying on\nhis short attention span.\nIn mutually codependent fashion, Ivanka relied on Dina to suggest management tactics\nthat would help her handle her father and the White House, while Dina relied on Ivanka to\noffer regular assurances that not everyone named Trump was completely crazy. This link\nmeant that within the greater West Wing population, Powell was seen as part of the much\ntighter family circle, which, while it conferred influence, also made her the target of ever\nsharper attacks. “She will expose herself as being totally incompetent,” said a bitter Katie\nWalsh, seeing Powell as less a normalizing influence than another aspect of the abnormal\nTrump family power play.\nAnd indeed, both Powell and Cohn had privately concluded that the job they both had\ntheir eye on—chief of staff, that singularly necessary White House management position\n—would always be impossible to perform if the president’s daughter and son-in-law, no\nmatter how much they were allied to them, were in de facto command whenever they\nwanted to exert it.\nDina and Ivanka were themselves spearheading an initiative that, otherwise, would\nhave been a fundamental responsibility of the chief of staff: controlling the president’s\ninformation flow.\n* * *\nThe unique problem here was partly how to get information to someone who did not (or\ncould not or would not) read, and who at best listened only selectively. But the other part\nof the problem was how best to qualify the information that he liked to get. Hope Hicks,\nafter more than a year at this side, had honed her instincts for the kind of information—the\nclips—that would please him. Bannon, in his intense and confiding voice, could insinuate\nhimself into the president’s mind. Kellyanne Conway brought him the latest outrages\nagainst him. There were his after-dinner calls—the billionaire chorus. And then cable,\nitself programmed to reach him—to court him or enrage him.\nThe information he did not get was formal information. The data. The details. The\noptions. The analysis. He didn’t do PowerPoint. For anything that smacked of a classroom\nor of being lectured to—“professor” was one of his bad words, and he was proud of never\ngoing to class, never buying a textbook, never taking a note—he got up and left the room.\nThis was a problem in multiple respects—indeed, in almost all the prescribed functions\nof the presidency. But perhaps most of all, it was a problem in the evaluation of strategic\nmilitary options.\nThe president liked generals. The more fruit salad they wore, the better. The president\nwas very pleased with the compliments he got for appointing generals who commanded\nthe respect that Mattis and Kelly and McMaster were accorded (pay no attention to\nMichael Flynn). What the president did not like was listening to generals, who, for the\nmost part, were skilled in the new army jargon of PowerPoint, data dumps, and\nMcKinsey-like presentations. One of the things that endeared Flynn to the president was\nthat Flynn, quite the conspiracist and drama queen, had a vivid storytelling sense.\nBy the time of the Syrian attack on Khan Sheikhoun, McMaster had been Trump’s\nNational Security Advisor for only about six weeks. Yet his efforts to inform the president\nhad already become an exercise in trying to tutor a recalcitrant and resentful student.\nRecently Trump’s meetings with McMaster had ended up in near acrimony, and now the\npresident was telling several friends that his new National Security Advisor was too\nboring and that he was going to fire him.\nMcMaster had been the default choice, a fact that Trump kept returning to: Why had he\nhired him? He blamed his son-in-law.\nAfter the president fired Flynn in February, he had spent two days at Mar-a-Lago\ninterviewing replacements, badly taxing his patience.\nJohn Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Bannon’s\nconsistent choice, made his aggressive light-up-the-world, go-to-war pitch.\nThen Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr., superintendent of the United States Military\nAcademy at West Point, presented himself with what Trump viewed positively as oldfashioned\nmilitary decorum. Yes, sir. No, sir. That’s correct, sir. Well, I think we know\nChina has some problems, sir. And in short order it seemed that Trump was selling Caslen\non the job.\n“That’s the guy I want,” said Trump. “He’s got the look.”\nBut Caslen demurred. He had never really had a staff job. Kushner thought he might\nnot be ready.\n“Yeah, but I liked that guy,” pressed Trump.\nThen McMaster, wearing a uniform with his silver star, came in and immediately\nlaunched into a wide-ranging lecture on global strategy. Trump was soon, and obviously,\ndistracted, and as the lecture continued he began sulking.\n“That guy bores the shit out of me,” announced Trump after McMaster left the room.\nBut Kushner pushed him to take another meeting with McMaster, who the next day\nshowed up without his uniform and in a baggy suit.\n“He looks like a beer salesman,” Trump said, announcing that he would hire McMaster\nbut didn’t want to have another meeting with him.\nShortly after his appointment, McMaster appeared on Morning Joe. Trump saw the\nshow and noted admiringly, “The guy sure gets good press.”\nThe president decided he had made a good hire.\n* * *\nBy midmorning on April 4, a full briefing had been assembled at the White House for the\npresident about the chemical attacks. Along with his daughter and Powell, most members\nof the president’s inner national security circle saw the bombing of Khan Sheikhoun as a\nstraightforward opportunity to register an absolute moral objection. The circumstance was\nunequivocal: Bashar al-Assad’s government, once again defying international law, had\nused chemical weapons. There was video documenting the attack and substantial\nagreement among intelligence agencies about Assad’s responsibility. The politics were\nright: Barack Obama failed to act when confronted with a Syrian chemical attack, and now\nTrump could. The downside was small; it would be a contained response. And it had the\nadded advantage of seeming to stand up to the Russians, Assad’s effective partners in\nSyria, which would score a political point at home.\nBannon, at perhaps his lowest moment of influence in the White House—many still\nfelt that his departure was imminent—was the only voice arguing against a military\nresponse. It was a purist’s rationale: keep the United States out of intractable problems,\nand certainly don’t increase our involvement in them. He was holding the line against the\nrising business-as-usual faction, making decisions based on the same set of assumptions,\nBannon believed, that had resulted in the Middle East quagmire. It was time to break the\nstandard-response pattern of behavior, represented by the Jarvanka-Powell-Cohn-\nMcMaster alliance. Forget normal—in fact, to Bannon, normal was precisely the problem.\nThe president had already agreed to McMaster’s demand that Bannon be removed from\nthe National Security Council, though the change wouldn’t be announced until the\nfollowing day. But Trump was also drawn to Bannon’s strategic view: Why do anything, if\nyou don’t have to? Or, why would you do something that doesn’t actually get you\nanything? Since taking office, the president had been developing an intuitive national\nsecurity view: keep as many despots who might otherwise screw you as happy as possible.\nA self-styled strongman, he was also a fundamental appeaser. In this instance, then, why\ncross the Russians?\nBy the afternoon, the national security team was experiencing a sense of rising panic:\nthe president, in their view, didn’t seem to be quite registering the situation. Bannon\nwasn’t helping. His hyperrationalist approach obviously appealed to the not-alwaysrational\npresident. A chemical attack didn’t change the circumstances on the ground,\nBannon argued; besides, there had been far worse attacks with far more casualties than\nthis one. If you were looking for broken children, you could find them anywhere. Why\nthese broken children?\nThe president was not a debater—well, not in any Socratic sense. Nor was he in any\nconventional sense a decision maker. And certainly he was not a student of foreign policy\nviews and options. But this was nevertheless turning into a genuine philosophical face-off.\n“Do nothing” had long been viewed as an unacceptable position of helplessness by\nAmerican foreign policy experts. The instinct to do something was driven by the desire to\nprove you were not limited to nothing. You couldn’t do nothing and show strength. But\nBannon’s approach was very much “A pox on all your houses,” it was not our mess, and\njudging by all recent evidence, no good would come of trying to help clean it up. That\neffort would cost military lives with no military reward. Bannon, believing in the need for\na radical shift in foreign policy, was proposing a new doctrine: Fuck ’em. This iron-fisted\nisolationism appealed to the president’s transactional self: What was in it for us (or for\nhim)?\nHence the urgency to get Bannon off the National Security Council. The curious thing\nis that in the beginning he was thought to be much more reasonable than Michael Flynn,\nwith his fixation on Iran as the source of all evil. Bannon was supposed to babysit Flynn.\nBut Bannon, quite to Kushner’s shock, had not just an isolationist worldview but an\napocalyptic one. Much of the world would burn and there was nothing you could do about\nit.\nThe announcement of Bannon’s removal was made the day after the attack. That in\nitself was a rather remarkable accomplishment on the part of the moderates. In little more\nthan two months, Trump’s radical, if not screwball, national security leadership had been\nreplaced by so-called reasonable people.\nThe job was now to bring the president into this circle of reason.\n* * *\nAs the day wore on, both Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell were united in their\ndetermination to persuade the president to react … normally. At the very minimum, an\nabsolute condemnation of the use of chemical weapons, a set of sanctions, and, ideally, a\nmilitary response—although not a big one. None of this was in any way exceptional.\nWhich was sort of the point: it was critical not to respond in a radical, destabilizing way—\nincluding a radical nonresponse.\nKushner was by now complaining to his wife that her father just didn’t get it. It had\neven been difficult to get a consensus on releasing a firm statement about the\nunacceptability of the use of chemical weapons at the noon press briefing. To both\nKushner and McMaster it seemed obvious that the president was more annoyed about\nhaving to think about the attack than by the attack itself.\nFinally, Ivanka told Dina they needed to show the president a different kind of\npresentation. Ivanka had long ago figured out how to make successful pitches to her\nfather. You had to push his enthusiasm buttons. He may be a businessman, but numbers\ndidn’t do it for him. He was not a spreadsheet jockey—his numbers guys dealt with\nspreadsheets. He liked big names. He liked the big picture—he liked literal big pictures.\nHe liked to see it. He liked “impact.”\nBut in one sense, the military, the intelligence community, and the White House’s\nnational security team remained behind the times. Theirs was a data world rather than a\npicture world. As it happened, the attack on Khan Sheikhoun had produced a wealth of\nvisual evidence. Bannon might be right that this attack was no more mortal than countless\nothers, but by focusing on this one and curating the visual proof, this atrocity became\nsingular.\nLate that afternoon, Ivanka and Dina created a presentation that Bannon, in disgust,\ncharacterized as pictures of kids foaming at the mouth. When the two women showed the\npresentation to the president, he went through it several times. He seemed mesmerized.\nWatching the president’s response, Bannon saw Trumpism melting before his eyes.\nTrump—despite his visceral resistance to the establishment ass-covering and standardissue\nforeign policy expertise that had pulled the country into hopeless wars—was\nsuddenly putty. After seeing all the horrifying photos, he immediately adopted a\ncompletely conventional point of view: it seemed inconceivable to him that we couldn’t\ndo something.\nThat evening, the president described the pictures in a call to a friend—the foam, all\nthat foam. These are just kids. He usually displayed a consistent contempt for anything but\noverwhelming military response; now he expressed a sudden, wide-eyed interest in all\nkinds of other military options.\nOn Wednesday, April 5, Trump received a briefing that outlined multiple options for\nhow to respond. But again McMaster burdened him with detail. He quickly became\nfrustrated, feeling that he was being manipulated.\nThe following day, the president and several of his top aides flew to Florida for a\nmeeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping—a meeting organized by Kushner with the\nhelp of Henry Kissinger. While aboard Air Force One, he held a tightly choreographed\nmeeting of the National Security Council, tying into the staff on the ground. By this point,\nthe decision about how to respond to the chemical attack had already been made: the\nmilitary would launch a Tomahawk cruise missile strike at Al Shayrat airfield. After a\nfinal round of discussion, while on board, the president, almost ceremonially, ordered the\nstrike for the next day.\nWith the meeting over and the decision made, Trump, in a buoyant mood, came back to\nchat with reporters traveling with him on Air Force One. In a teasing fashion, he declined\nto say what he planned to do about Syria. An hour later, Air Force One landed and the\npresident was hustled to Mar-a-Lago.\nThe Chinese president and his wife arrived for dinner shortly after five o’clock and\nwere greeted by a military guard on the Mar-a-Lago driveway. With Ivanka supervising\narrangements, virtually the entire White House senior staff attended.\nDuring a dinner of Dover sole, haricots verts, and thumbelina carrots—Kushner seated\nwith the Chinese first couple, Bannon at the end of the table—the attack on Al Shayrat\nairfield was launched.\nShortly before ten, the president, reading straight off the teleprompter, announced that\nthe mission had been completed. Dina Powell arranged a for-posterity photo of the\npresident with his advisers and national security team in the makeshift situation room at\nMar-a-Lago. She was the only woman in the room. Steve Bannon glowered from his seat\nat the table, revolted by the stagecraft and the “phoniness of the fucking thing.”\nIt was a cheerful and relieved Trump who mingled with his guests among the palm\ntrees and mangroves. “That was a big one,” he confided to a friend. His national security\nstaff were even more relieved. The unpredictable president seemed almost predictable.\nThe unmanageable president, manageable.\n15\nMEDIA\nO\nn April 19, Bill O’Reilly, the Fox anchor and the biggest star in cable news, was\npushed out by the Murdoch family over charges of sexual harassment. This was a\ncontinuation of the purge at the network that had begun nine months before with the firing\nof its chief, Roger Ailes. Fox achieved its ultimate political influence with the election of\nDonald Trump, yet now the future of the network seemed held in a peculiar Murdoch\nfamily limbo between conservative father and liberal sons.\nA few hours after the O’Reilly announcement, Ailes, from his new oceanfront home in\nPalm Beach—precluded by his separation agreement with Fox from any efforts to\ncompete with it for eighteen months—sent an emissary into the West Wing with a\nquestion for Steve Bannon: O’Reilly and Hannity are in, what about you? Ailes, in secret,\nhad been plotting his comeback with a new conservative network. Currently in internal\nexile inside the White House, Bannon—“the next Ailes”—was all ears.\nThis was not just the plotting of ambitious men, seeking both opportunity and revenge;\nthe idea for a new network was also driven by an urgent sense that the Trump\nphenomenon was about, as much as anything else, right-wing media. For twenty years,\nFox had honed its populist message: liberals were stealing and ruining the country. Then,\njust at the moment that many liberals—including Rupert Murdoch’s sons, who were\nincreasingly in control of their father’s company—had begun to believe that the Fox\naudience was beginning to age out, with its anti-gay-marriage, anti-abortion, antiimmigrant\nsocial message, which seemed too hoary for younger Republicans, along came\nBreitbart News. Breitbart not only spoke to a much younger right-wing audience—here\nBannon felt he was as much in tune with this audience as Ailes was with his—but it had\nturned this audience into a huge army of digital activists (or social media trolls).\nAs right-wing media had fiercely coalesced around Trump—readily excusing all the\nways he might contradict the traditional conservative ethos—mainstream media had\nbecome as fiercely resistant. The country was divided as much by media as by politics.\nMedia was the avatar of politics. A sidelined Ailes was eager to get back in the game. This\nwas his natural playing field: (1) Trump’s election proved the power of a significantly\nsmaller but more dedicated electoral base—just as, in cable television terms, a smaller\nhardcore base was more valuable than a bigger, less committed one; (2) this meant an\ninverse dedication by an equally small circle of passionate enemies; (3) hence, there\nwould be blood.\nIf Bannon was as finished as he appeared in the White House, this was his opportunity,\ntoo. Indeed, the problem with Bannon’s $1.5 million a year Internetcentric Breitbart News\nwas that it couldn’t be monetized or scaled up in a big way, but with O’Reilly and Hannity\non board, there could be television riches fueled by, into the foreseeable future, a new\nTrump-inspired era of right-wing passion and hegemony.\nAiles’s message to his would-be protégé was plain: Not just the rise of Trump, but the\nfall of Fox could be Bannon’s moment.\nIn reply, Bannon let Ailes know that for now, he was trying to hold on to his position in\nthe White House. But yes, the opportunity was obvious.\n* * *\nEven as O’Reilly’s fate was being debated by the Murdochs, Trump, understanding\nO’Reilly’s power and knowing how much O’Reilly’s audience overlapped with his own\nbase, had expressed his support and approval—“I don’t think Bill did anything wrong… .\nHe is a good person,” he told the New York Times.\nBut in fact a paradox of the new strength of conservative media was Trump himself.\nDuring the campaign, when it suited him, he had turned on Fox. If there were other media\nopportunities, he took them. (In the recent past, Republicans, particularly in the primary\nseason, paid careful obeisance to Fox over other media outlets.) Trump kept insisting that\nhe was bigger than just conservative media.\nIn the past month, Ailes, a frequent Trump caller and after-dinner adviser, had all but\nstopped speaking to the president, piqued by the constant reports that Trump was badmouthing\nhim as he praised a newly attentive Murdoch, who had, before the election, only\never ridiculed Trump.\n“Men who demand the most loyalty tend to be the least loyal pricks,” noted a sardonic\nAiles (a man who himself demanded lots of loyalty).\nThe conundrum was that conservative media saw Trump as its creature, while Trump\nsaw himself as a star, a vaunted and valued product of all media, one climbing ever higher.\nIt was a cult of personality, and he was the personality. He was the most famous man in\nthe world. Everybody loved him—or ought to.\nOn Trump’s part this was, arguably, something of a large misunderstanding about the\nnature of conservative media. He clearly did not understand that what conservative media\nelevated, liberal media would necessarily take down. Trump, goaded by Bannon, would\ncontinue to do the things that would delight conservative media and incur the wrath of\nliberal media. That was the program. The more your supporters loved you, the more your\nantagonists hated you. That’s how it was supposed to work. And that’s how it was\nworking.\nBut Trump himself was desperately wounded by his treatment in the mainstream\nmedia. He obsessed on every slight until it was overtaken by the next slight. Slights were\nsingled out and replayed again and again, his mood worsening with each replay (he was\nalways rerunning the DVR). Much of the president’s daily conversation was a repetitive\nrundown of what various anchors and hosts had said about him. And he was upset not only\nwhen he was attacked, but when the people around him were attacked. But he did not\ncredit their loyalty, or blame himself or the nature of liberal media for the indignities\nheaped on his staffers; he blamed them and their inability to get good press.\nMainstream media’s self-righteousness and contempt for Trump helped provide a\ntsunami of clicks for right-wing media. But an often raging, self-pitying, tormented\npresident had not gotten this memo, or had failed to comprehend it. He was looking for\nmedia love everywhere. In this, Trump quite profoundly seemed unable to distinguish\nbetween his political advantage and his personal needs—he thought emotionally, not\nstrategically.\nThe great value of being president, in his view, was that you’re the most famous man in\nthe world, and fame is always venerated and adored by the media. Isn’t it? But,\nconfusingly, Trump was president in large part because of his particular talent, conscious\nor reflexive, to alienate the media, which then turned him into a figure reviled by the\nmedia. This was not a dialectical space that was comfortable for an insecure man.\n“For Trump,” noted Ailes, “the media represented power, much more so than politics,\nand he wanted the attention and respect of its most powerful men. Donald and I were\nreally quite good friends for more than 25 years, but he would have preferred to be friends\nwith Murdoch, who thought he was a moron—at least until he became president.”\n* * *\nThe White House Correspondents’ Dinner was set for April 29, the one hundredth day of\nthe Trump administration. The annual dinner, once an insiders’ event, had become an\nopportunity for media organizations to promote themselves by recruiting celebrities—\nmost of whom had nothing to do with journalism or politics—to sit at their tables. This\nhad resulted in a notable Trump humiliation when, in 2011, Barack Obama singled out\nTrump for particular mockery. In Trump lore, this was the insult that pushed him to make\nthe 2016 run.\nNot long after the Trump team’s arrival in the White House, the Correspondents’\nDinner became a cause for worry. On a winter afternoon in Kellyanne Conway’s upstairs\nWest Wing office, Conway and Hope Hicks engaged in a pained discussion about what to\ndo.\nThe central problem was that the president was neither inclined to make fun of himself,\nnor particularly funny himself—at least not, in Conway’s description, “in that kind of\nhumorous way.”\nGeorge W. Bush had famously resisted the Correspondents’ Dinner and suffered\ngreatly at it, but he had prepped extensively, and every year he pulled out an acceptable\nperformance. But neither woman, confiding their concerns around the small table in\nConway’s office to a journalist they regarded as sympathetic, thought Trump had a\nrealistic chance of making the dinner anything like a success.\n“He doesn’t appreciate cruel humor,” said Conway.\n“His style is more old-fashioned,” said Hicks.\nBoth women, clearly seeing the Correspondents’ Dinner as an intractable problem, kept\ncharacterizing the event as “unfair,” which, more generally, is how they characterized the\nmedia’s view of Trump. “He’s unfairly portrayed.” “They don’t give him the benefit of the\ndoubt.” “He’s just not treated the way other presidents have been treated.”\nThe burden here for Conway and Hicks was their understanding that the president did\nnot see the media’s lack of regard for him as part of a political divide on which he stood\non a particular side. Instead, he perceived it as a deep personal attack on him: for entirely\nunfair reasons, ad hominem reasons, the media just did not like him. Ridiculed him.\nCruelly. Why?\nThe journalist, trying to offer some comfort, told the two women there was a rumor\ngoing around that Graydon Carter—the editor of Vanity Fair and host of one of the most\nimportant parties of the Correspondents’ Dinner weekend, and, for decades, one of\nTrump’s key tormentors in the media—was shortly going to be pushed out of the\nmagazine.\n“Really?” said Hicks, jumping up. “Oh my God, can I tell him? Would that be okay?\nHe’ll want to know this.” She headed quickly downstairs to the Oval Office.\n* * *\nCuriously, Conway and Hicks each portrayed a side of the president’s alter ego media\nproblem. Conway was the bitter antagonist, the mud-in-your-eye messenger who reliably\nsent the media into paroxysms of outrage against the president. Hicks was the confidante\never trying to get the president a break and some good ink in the only media he really\ncared about—the media that most hated him. But as different as they were in their media\nfunctions and temperament, both women had achieved remarkable influence in the\nadministration by serving as the key lieutenants responsible for addressing the president’s\nmost pressing concern, his media reputation.\nWhile Trump was in most ways a conventional misogynist, in the workplace he was\nmuch closer to women than to men. The former he confided in, the latter he held at arm’s\nlength. He liked and needed his office wives, and he trusted them with his most important\npersonal issues. Women, according to Trump, were simply more loyal and trustworthy\nthan men. Men might be more forceful and competent, but they were also more likely to\nhave their own agendas. Women, by their nature, or Trump’s version of their nature, were\nmore likely to focus their purpose on a man. A man like Trump.\nIt wasn’t happenstance or just casting balance that his Apprentice sidekick was a\nwoman, nor that his daughter Ivanka had become one of his closest confidants. He felt\nwomen understood him. Or, the kind of women he liked—positive-outlook, can-do, loyal\nwomen, who also looked good—understood him. Everybody who successfully worked for\nhim understood that there was always a subtext of his needs and personal tics that had to\nbe scrupulously attended to; in this, he was not all that different from other highly\nsuccessful figures, just more so. It would be hard to imagine someone who expected a\ngreater awareness of and more catering to his peculiar whims, rhythms, prejudices, and\noften inchoate desires. He needed special—extra special—handling. Women, he explained\nto one friend with something like self-awareness, generally got this more precisely than\nmen. In particular, women who self-selected themselves as tolerant of or oblivious to or\namused by or steeled against his casual misogyny and constant sexual subtext—which was\nsomehow, incongruously and often jarringly, matched with paternal regard—got this.\n* * *\nKellyanne Conway first met Donald Trump at a meeting of the condo board for the Trump\nInternational Hotel, which was directly across the street from the UN and was where, in\nthe early 2000s, she lived with her husband and children. Conway’s husband, George, a\ngraduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School, was a partner at the premier corporate\nmergers and acquisitions firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. (Though Wachtell was a\nDemocratic-leaning firm, George had played a behind-the-scenes role on the team that\nrepresented Paula Jones in her pursuit of Bill Clinton.) In its professional and domestic\nbalance, the Conway family was organized around George’s career. Kellyanne’s career\nwas a sidelight.\nKellyanne, who in the Trump campaign would use her working-class biography to\ngood effect, grew up in central New Jersey, the daughter of a trucker, raised by a single\nmother (and, always in her narrative, her grandmother and two unmarried aunts). She went\nto George Washington law school and afterward interned for Reagan’s pollster, Richard\nWirthlin. Then she became the assistant to Frank Luntz, a curious figure in the Republican\nParty, known as much for his television deals and toupee as for his polling acumen.\nConway herself began to make appearances on cable TV while working for Luntz.\nOne virtue of the research and polling business she started in 1995 was that it could\nadapt to her husband’s career. But she never much rose above a midrank presence in\nRepublican political circles, nor did she become more than the also-ran behind Ann\nCoulter and Laura Ingraham on cable television—which is where Trump first saw her and\nwhy he singled her out at the condo board meeting.\nIn a real sense, however, her advantage was not meeting Trump but being taken up by\nthe Mercers. They recruited Conway in 2015 to work on the Cruz campaign, when Trump\nwas still far from the conservative ideal, and then, in August 2016, inserted her into the\nTrump campaign.\nShe understood her role. “I will only ever call you Mr. Trump,” she told the candidate\nwith perfect-pitch solemnity when he interviewed her for the job. It was a trope she would\nrepeat in interview after interview—Conway was a catalog of learned lines—a message\nrepeated as much for Trump as for others.\nHer title was campaign manager, but that was a misnomer. Bannon was the real\nmanager, and she was the senior pollster. But Bannon shortly replaced her in that role and\nshe was left in what Trump saw as the vastly more important role of cable spokesperson.\nConway seemed to have a convenient On-Off toggle. In private, in the Off position, she\nseemed to regard Trump as a figure of exhausting exaggeration or even absurdity—or, at\nleast, if you regarded him that way, she seemed to suggest that she might, too. She\nillustrated her opinion of her boss with a whole series of facial expressions: eyes rolling,\nmouth agape, head snapping back. But in the On position, she metamorphosed into\nbeliever, protector, defender, and handler. Conway is an antifeminist (or, actually, in a\ncomplicated ideological somersault, she sees feminists as being antifeminists), ascribing\nher methods and temperament to her being a wife and mother. She’s instinctive and\nreactive. Hence her role as the ultimate Trump defender: she verbally threw herself in\nfront of any bullet coming his way.\nTrump loved her defend-at-all-costs shtick. Conway’s appearances were on his\nschedule to watch live. His was often the first call she got after coming off the air. She\nchanneled Trump: she said exactly the kind of Trump stuff that would otherwise make her\nput a finger-gun to her head.\nAfter the election—Trump’s victory setting off a domestic reordering in the Conway\nhousehold, and a scramble to get her husband an administration job—Trump assumed she\nwould be his press secretary. “He and my mother,” Conway said, “because they both\nwatch a lot of television, thought this was one of the most important jobs.” In Conway’s\nversion, she turned Trump down or demurred. She kept proposing alternatives in which\nshe would be the key spokesperson but would be more as well. In fact, almost everyone\nelse was maneuvering Trump around his desire to appoint Conway.\nLoyalty was Trump’s most valued attribute, and in Conway’s view her kamikaze-like\nmedia defense of the president had earned her a position of utmost primacy in the White\nHouse. But in her public persona, she had pushed the boundaries of loyalty too far; she\nwas so hyperbolic that even Trump loyalists found her behavior extreme and were\nrepelled. None were more put off than Jared and Ivanka, who, appalled at the\nshamelessness of her television appearances, extended this into a larger critique of\nConway’s vulgarity. When referring to her, they were particularly partial to using the\nshorthand “nails,” a reference to her Cruella de Vil-length manicure treatments.\nBy mid-February she was already the subject of leaks—many coming from Jared and\nIvanka—about how she had been sidelined. She vociferously defended herself, producing\na list of television appearances still on her schedule, albeit lesser ones. But she also had a\nteary scene with Trump in the Oval Office, offering to resign if the president had lost faith\nin her. Almost invariably, when confronted with self-abnegation, Trump offered copious\nreassurances. “You will always have a place in my administration,” he told her. “You will\nbe here for eight years.”\nBut she had indeed been sidelined, reduced to second-rate media, to being a designated\nemissary to right-wing groups, and left out of any meaningful decision making. This she\nblamed on the media, a scourge that further united her in self-pity with Donald Trump. In\nfact, her relationship with the president deepened as they bonded over their media wounds.\n* * *\nHope Hicks, then age twenty-six, was the campaign’s first hire. She knew the president\nvastly better than Conway did, and she understood that her most important media function\nwas not to be in the media.\nHicks grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. Her father was a PR executive who now\nworked for the Glover Park Group, the Democratic-leaning communications and political\nconsulting firm; her mother was a former staffer for a democratic congressman. An\nindifferent student, Hicks went to Southern Methodist University and then did some\nmodeling before getting a PR job. She first went to work for Matthew Hiltzik, who ran a\nsmall New York-based PR firm and was noted for his ability to work with highmaintenance\nclients, including the movie producer Harvey Weinstein (later pilloried for\nyears of sexual harassment and abuse—accusations that Hiltzik and his staff had long\nhelped protect him from) and the television personality Katie Couric. Hiltzik, an active\nDemocrat who had worked for Hillary Clinton, also represented Ivanka Trump’s fashion\nline; Hicks started to do some work for the account and then joined Ivanka’s company full\ntime. In 2015, Ivanka seconded her to her father’s campaign; as the campaign progressed,\nmoving from novelty project to political factor to juggernaut, Hicks’s family increasingly,\nand incredulously, viewed her as rather having been taken captive. (Following the Trump\nvictory and her move into the White House, her friends and intimates talked with great\nconcern about what kind of therapies and recuperation she would need after her tenure\nwas finally over.)\nOver the eighteen months of the campaign, the traveling group usually consisted of the\ncandidate, Hicks, and the campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. In time, she became—\nin addition to an inadvertent participant in history, about which she was quite as\nastonished as anyone—a kind of Stepford factotum, as absolutely dedicated to and tolerant\nof Mr. Trump as anyone who had ever worked for him.\nShortly after Lewandowski, with whom Hicks had an on-and-off romantic relationship,\nwas fired in June 2016 for clashing with Trump family members, Hicks sat in Trump\nTower with Trump and his sons, worrying about Lewandowski’s treatment in the press and\nwondering aloud how she might help him. Trump, who otherwise seemed to treat Hicks in\na protective and even paternal way, looked up and said, “Why? You’ve already done\nenough for him. You’re the best piece of tail he’ll ever have,” sending Hicks running from\nthe room.\nAs new layers began to form around Trump, first as nominee and then as presidentelect,\nHicks continued playing the role of his personal PR woman. She would remain his\nconstant shadow and the person with the best access to him. “Have you spoken to Hope?”\nwere among the words most frequently uttered in the West Wing.\nHicks, sponsored by Ivanka and ever loyal to her, was in fact thought of as Trump’s\nreal daughter, while Ivanka was thought of as his real wife. More functionally, but as\nelementally, Hicks was the president’s chief media handler. She worked by the president’s\nside, wholly separate from the White House’s forty-person-strong communications office.\nThe president’s personal message and image were entrusted to her—or, more accurately,\nshe was the president’s agent in retailing that message and image, which he trusted to no\none but himself. Together they formed something of a freelance operation.\nWithout any particular politics of her own, and, with her New York PR background,\nquite looking down on the right-wing press, she was the president’s official liaison to the\nmainstream media. The president had charged her with the ultimate job: a good write-up\nin the New York Times.\nThat, in the president’s estimation, had yet failed to happen, “but Hope tries and tries,”\nthe president said.\nOn more than one occasion, after a day—one of the countless days—of particularly\nbad notices, the president greeted her, affectionately, with “You must be the world’s worst\nPR person.”\n* * *\nIn the early days of the transition, with Conway out of the running for the press secretary\njob, Trump became determined to find a “star.” The conservative radio host Laura\nIngraham, who had spoken at the convention, was on the list, as was Ann Coulter. Fox\nBusiness’s Maria Bartiromo was also under consideration. (This was television, the\npresident-elect said, and it ought to be a good-looking woman.) When none of those ideas\npanned out, the job was offered to Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, who turned it down.\nBut there was a counterview: the press secretary ought to be the opposite of a star. In\nfact, the entire press operation ought to be downgraded. If the press was the enemy, why\npander to it, why give it more visibility? This was fundamental Bannonism: stop thinking\nyou can somehow get along with your enemies.\nAs the debate went on, Priebus pushed for one of his deputies at the Republican\nNational Committee, Sean Spicer, a well-liked forty-five-year-old Washington political\nprofessional with a string of posts on the Hill in the George W. Bush years as well as with\nthe RNC. Spicer, hesitant to take the job, kept anxiously posing the question to colleagues\nin the Washington swamp: “If I do this, will I ever be able to work again?”\nThere were conflicting answers.\nDuring the transition, many members of Trump’s team came to agree with Bannon that\ntheir approach to White House press management ought to be to push it off—and the\nlonger the arm’s length the better. For the press, this initiative, or rumors of it, became\nanother sign of the incoming administration’s antipress stance and its systematic efforts to\ncut off the information supply. In truth, the suggestions about moving the briefing room\naway from the White House, or curtailing the briefing schedule, or limiting broadcast\nwindows or press pool access, were variously discussed by other incoming\nadministrations. In her husband’s White House, Hillary Clinton had been a proponent of\nlimiting press access.\nIt was Donald Trump who was not able to relinquish this proximity to the press and the\nstage in his own house. He regularly berated Spicer for his ham-handed performances,\noften giving his full attention to them. His response to Spicer’s briefings was part of his\ncontinuing belief that nobody could work the media like he could, that somehow he had\nbeen stuck with an F-Troop communications team that was absent charisma, magnetism,\nand proper media connections.\nTrump’s pressure on Spicer—a constant stream of directorial castigation and\ninstruction that reliably rattled the press secretary—helped turn the briefings into a can’tmiss\ntrain wreck. Meanwhile, the real press operation had more or less devolved into a set\nof competing press organizations within the White House.\nThere was Hope Hicks and the president, living in what other West Wingers\ncharacterized as an alternative universe in which the mainstream media would yet\ndiscover the charm and wisdom of Donald Trump. Where past presidents might have spent\nportions of their day talking about the needs, desires, and points of leverage among\nvarious members of Congress, the president and Hicks spent a great deal of time talking\nabout a fixed cast of media personalities, trying to second-guess the real agendas and weak\nspots among cable anchors and producers and Times and Post reporters.\nOften the focus of this otherworldly ambition was directed at Times reporter Maggie\nHaberman. Haberman’s front-page beat at the paper, which might be called the “weirdness\nof Donald Trump” beat, involved producing vivid tales of eccentricities, questionable\nbehavior, and shit the president says, told in a knowing, deadpan style. Beyond\nacknowledging that Trump was a boy from Queens yet in awe of the Times, nobody in the\nWest Wing could explain why he and Hicks would so often turn to Haberman for what\nwould so reliably be a mocking and hurtful portrayal. There was some feeling that Trump\nwas returning to scenes of past success: the Times might be against him, but Haberman\nhad worked at the New York Post for many years. “She’s very professional,” Conway said,\nspeaking in defense of the president and trying to justify Haberman’s extraordinary access.\nBut however intent he remained on getting good ink in the Times, the president saw\nHaberman as “mean and horrible.” And yet, on a near-weekly basis, he and Hicks plotted\nwhen next to have the Times come in.\n* * *\nKushner had his personal press operation and Bannon had his. The leaking culture had\nbecome so open and overt—most of the time everybody could identify everybody else’s\nleaks—that it was now formally staffed.\nKushner’s Office of American Innovation employed, as its spokesperson, Josh Raffel,\nwho, like Hicks, came out of Matthew Hiltzik’s PR shop. Raffel, a Democrat who had\nbeen working in Hollywood, acted as Kushner and his wife’s personal rep—not least of all\nbecause the couple felt that Spicer, owing his allegiance to Priebus, was not aggressively\nrepresenting them. This was explicit. “Josh is Jared’s Hope,” was his internal West Wing\njob description.\nRaffel coordinated all of Kushner and Ivanka’s personal press, though there was more\nof this for Ivanka than for Kushner. But, more importantly, Raffel coordinated all of\nKushner’s substantial leaking, or, as it were, his off-the-record briefings and guidance—no\nsmall part of it against Bannon. Kushner, who with great conviction asserted that he never\nleaked, in part justified his press operation as a defense against Bannon’s press operation.\nBannon’s “person,” Alexandra Preate—a witty conservative socialite partial to\nchampagne—had previously represented Breitbart News and other conservative figures\nlike CNBC’s Larry Kudlow, and was close friends with Rebekah Mercer. In a relationship\nthat nobody seemed quite able to explain, she handled all of Bannon’s press “outreach”\nbut was not employed by the White House, although she maintained an office, or at least\nan officelike presence, there. The point was clear: her client was Bannon and not the\nTrump administration.\nBannon, to Jared and Ivanka’s continued alarm, had unique access to Breitbart’s\nsignificant abilities to change the right-wing mood and focus. Bannon insisted he had cut\nhis ties to his former colleagues at Breitbart, but that strained everybody’s credulity—and\neverybody figured nobody was supposed to believe it. Rather, everybody was supposed to\nfear it.\nThere was, curiously, general agreement in the West Wing that Donald Trump, the\nmedia president, had one of the most dysfunctional communication operations in modern\nWhite House history. Mike Dubke, a Republican PR operative who was hired as White\nHouse communications director, was, by all estimations, from the first day on his way out\nthe door. In the end he lasted only three months.\n* * *\nThe White House Correspondents’ Dinner rose, as much as any other challenge for the\nnew president and his team, as a test of his abilities. He wanted to do it. He was certain\nthat the power of his charm was greater than the rancor that he bore this audience—or that\nthey bore him.\nHe recalled his 2015 Saturday Night Live appearance—which, in his view, was entirely\nsuccessful. In fact, he had refused to prepare, had kept saying he would “improvise,” no\nproblem. Comedians don’t actually improvise, he was told; it’s all scripted and rehearsed.\nBut this counsel had only marginal effect.\nAlmost nobody except the president himself thought he could pull off the\nCorrespondents’ Dinner. His staff was terrified that he would die up there in front of a\nseething and contemptuous audience. Though he could dish it out, often very harshly, no\none thought he could take it. Still, the president seemed eager to appear at the event, if\ncasual about it, too—with Hicks, ordinarily encouraging his every impulse, trying not to.\nBannon pressed the symbolic point: the president should not be seen currying the favor\nof his enemies, or trying to entertain them. The media was a much better whipping boy\nthan it was a partner in crime. The Bannon principle, the steel stake in the ground,\nremained: don’t bend, don’t accommodate, don’t meet halfway. And in the end, rather than\nimplying that Trump did not have the talent and wit to move this crowd, that was a much\nbetter way to persuade the president that he should not appear at the dinner.\nWhen Trump finally agreed to forgo the event, Conway, Hicks, and virtually\neverybody else in the West Wing breathed a lot easier.\n* * *\nShortly after five o’clock on the one hundredth day of his presidency—a particularly\nmuggy one—while twenty-five hundred or so members of news organizations and their\nfriends gathered at the Washington Hilton for the White House Correspondents’ Dinner,\nthe president left the West Wing for Marine One, which was soon en route to Andrews Air\nForce Base. Accompanying him were Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, Reince Priebus,\nHope Hicks, and Kellyanne Conway. Vice President Pence and his wife joined the group\nat Andrews for the brief flight on Air Force One to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where the\npresident would give a speech. During the flight, crab cakes were served, and Face the\nNation’s John Dickerson was granted a special hundredth-day interview.\nThe first Harrisburg event was held at a factory that manufactured landscaping and\ngardening tools, where the president closely inspected a line of colorful wheelbarrows.\nThe next event, where the speech would be delivered, was at a rodeo arena in the Farm\nShow Complex and Expo Center.\nAnd that was the point of this little trip. It had been designed both to remind the rest of\nthe country that the president was not just another phony baloney in a tux like those at the\nWhite House Correspondents’ Dinner (this somehow presupposed that the president’s base\ncared about or was even aware of the event) and to keep the president’s mind off the fact\nthat he was missing the dinner.\nBut the president kept asking for updates on the jokes.\n16\nCOMEY\n“I\nt’s impossible to make him understand you can’t stop these investigations,” said Roger\nAiles in early May, a frustrated voice in the Trump kitchen cabinet. “In the old days,\nyou could say leave it alone. Now you say leave it alone and you’re the one who gets\ninvestigated. He can’t get this through his head.”\nIn fact, as various members of the billionaires’ cabinet tried to calm down the president\nduring their evening phone calls, they were largely egging him on by expressing deep\nconcern about his DOJ and FBI peril. Many of Trump’s wealthy friends saw themselves as\nhaving particular DOJ expertise. In their own careers, they had had enough issues with the\nJustice Department to prompt them to develop DOJ relationships and sources, and now\nthey were always up on DOJ gossip. Flynn was going to throw him in the soup. Manafort\nwas going to roll. And it wasn’t just Russia. It was Atlantic City. And Mar-a-Lago. And\nTrump SoHo.\nBoth Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani—each a self-styled expert on the DOJ and the\nFBI, and ever assuring Trump of their inside sources—encouraged him to take the view\nthat the DOJ was resolved against him; it was all part of a holdover Obama plot.\nEven more urgent was Charlie Kushner’s fear, channeled through his son and daughterin-law,\nthat the Kushner family’s dealings were getting wrapped up in the pursuit of\nTrump. Leaks in January had put the kibosh on the Kushners’ deal with the Chinese\nfinancial colossus Anbang Insurance Group to refinance the family’s large debt in one of\nits major real estate holdings, 666 Fifth Avenue. At the end of April, the New York Times,\nsupplied with leaks from the DOJ, linked the Kushner business in a front-page article to\nBeny Steinmetz—an Israeli diamond, mining, and real estate billionaire with Russian ties\nwho was under chronic investigation around the world. (The Kushner position was not\nhelped by the fact that the president had been gleefully telling multiple people that Jared\ncould solve the Middle East problem because the Kushners knew all the best people in\nIsrael.) During the first week of May, the Times and the Washington Post covered the\nKushner family’s supposed efforts to attract Chinese investors with the promise of U.S.\nvisas.\n“The kids”—Jared and Ivanka—exhibited an increasingly panicked sense that the FBI\nand DOJ were moving beyond Russian election interference and into finances. “Ivanka is\nterrified,” said a satisfied Bannon.\nTrump turned to suggesting to his billionaire chorus that he fire FBI director Comey.\nHe had raised this idea many times before, but always, seemingly, at the same time and in\nthe same context that he brought up the possibility of firing everybody. Should I fire\nBannon? Should I fire Reince? Should I fire McMaster? Should I fire Spicer? Should I fire\nTillerson? This ritual was, everyone understood, more a pretext to a discussion of the\npower he held than it was, strictly, about personnel decisions. Still, in Trump’s poison-thewell\nfashion, the should-I-fire-so-and-so question, and any consideration of it by any of\nthe billionaires, was translated into agreement, as in: Carl Icahn thinks I should fire\nComey (or Bannon, or Priebus, or McMaster, or Tillerson).\nHis daughter and son-in-law, their urgency compounded by Charlie Kushner’s concern,\nencouraged him, arguing that the once possibly charmable Comey was now a dangerous\nand uncontrollable player whose profit would inevitably be their loss. When Trump got\nwound up about something, Bannon noted, someone was usually winding him up. The\nfamily focus of discussion—insistent, almost frenzied—became wholly about Comey’s\nambition. He would rise by damaging them. And the drumbeat grew.\n“That son of a bitch is going to try to fire the head of the FBI,” said Ailes.\nDuring the first week of May, the president had a ranting meeting with Sessions and his\ndeputy Rod Rosenstein. It was a humiliating meeting for both men, with Trump insisting\nthey couldn’t control their own people and pushing them to find a reason to fire Comey—\nin effect, he blamed them for not having come up with that reason months ago. (It was\ntheir fault, he implied, that Comey hadn’t been fired right off the bat.)\nAlso that week, there was a meeting that included the president, Jared and Ivanka,\nBannon, Priebus, and White House counsel Don McGahn. It was a closed-door meeting—\nwidely noted because it was unusual for the Oval Office door ever to be closed.\nAll the Democrats hate Comey, said the president, expressing his certain and selfjustifying\nview. All the FBI agents hate him, too—75 percent of them can’t stand him.\n(This was a number that Kushner had somehow alighted on, and Trump had taken it up.)\nFiring Comey will be a huge fundraising advantage, declared the president, a man who\nalmost never talked about fundraising.\nMcGahn tried to explain that in fact Comey himself was not running the Russia\ninvestigation, that without Comey the investigation would proceed anyway. McGahn, the\nlawyer whose job was necessarily to issue cautions, was a frequent target of Trump rages.\nTypically these would begin as a kind of exaggeration or acting and then devolve into the\nreal thing: uncontrollable, vein-popping, ugly-face, tantrum stuff. It got primal. Now the\npresident’s denunciations focused in a vicious fury on McGahn and his cautions about\nComey.\n“Comey was a rat,” repeated Trump. There were rats everywhere and you had to get rid\nof them. John Dean, John Dean, he repeated. “Do you know what John Dean did to\nNixon?”\nTrump, who saw history through personalities—people he might have liked or disliked\n—was a John Dean freak. He went bananas when a now gray and much aged Dean\nappeared on talk shows to compare the Trump-Russia investigation to Watergate. That\nwould bring the president to instant attention and launch an inevitable talk-back\nmonologue to the screen about loyalty and what people would do for media attention. It\nmight also be accompanied by several revisionist theories Trump had about Watergate and\nhow Nixon had been framed. And always there were rats. A rat was someone who would\ntake you down for his own advantage. If you had a rat, you needed to kill it. And there\nwere rats all around.\n(Later, it was Bannon who had to take the president aside and tell him that John Dean\nhad been the White House counsel in the Nixon administration, so maybe it would be a\ngood idea to lighten up on McGahn.)\nAs the meeting went on, Bannon, from the doghouse and now, in their mutual\nantipathy to Jarvanka, allied with Priebus, seized the opportunity to make an impassioned\ncase opposing any move against Comey—which was also, as much, an effort to make the\ncase against Jared and Ivanka and their allies, “the geniuses.” (“The geniuses” was one of\nTrump’s terms of derision for anybody who might annoy him or think they were smarter\nthan him, and Bannon now appropriated the term and applied it to Trump’s family.)\nOffering forceful and dire warnings, Bannon told the president: “This Russian story is a\nthird-tier story, but you fire Comey and it’ll be the biggest story in the world.”\nBy the time the meeting ended, Bannon and Priebus believed they had prevailed. But\nthat weekend, at Bedminster, the president, again listening to the deep dismay of his\ndaughter and son-in-law, built up another head of steam. With Jared and Ivanka, Stephen\nMiller was also along for the weekend. The weather was bad and the president missed his\ngolf game, dwelling, with Jared, on his Comey fury. It was Jared, in the version told by\nthose outside the Jarvanka circle, that pushed for action, once more winding up his fatherin-law.\nWith the president’s assent, Kushner, in this version, gave Miller notes on why the\nFBI director should be fired and asked him to draft a letter that could set out the basis for\nimmediate dismissal. Miller—less than a deft drafting hand—recruited Hicks to help,\nanother person without clearly relevant abilities. (Miller would later be admonished by\nBannon for letting himself get tied up, and potentially implicated, in the Comey mess.)\nThe letter, in the panicky draft assembled by Miller and Hicks, either from Kushner’s\ndirections or on instructions directly coming from the president, was an off-the-wall\nmishmash containing the talking points—Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton\ninvestigation; the assertion (from Kushner) that the FBI itself had turned against Comey;\nand, the president’s key obsession, the fact that Comey wouldn’t publicly acknowledge\nthat the president wasn’t under investigation—that would form the Trump family’s case\nfor firing Comey. That is, everything but the fact that Comey’s FBI was investigating the\npresident.\nThe Kushner side, for its part, bitterly fought back against any characterization of\nKushner as the prime mover or mastermind, in effect putting the entire Bedminster letter\neffort—as well as the determination to get rid of Comey—entirely on the president’s head\nand casting Kushner as passive bystander. (The Kushner side’s position was articulated as\nfollows: “Did he [Kushner] support the decision? Yes. Was he told this was happening?\nYes. Did he encourage it? No. Was he fighting for it [Comey’s ouster] for weeks and\nmonths? No. Did he fight [the ouster]? No. Did he say it would go badly? No.”)\nHorrified, McGahn quashed sending it. Nevertheless, it was passed to Sessions and\nRosenstein, who quickly began drafting their own version of what Kushner and the\npresident obviously wanted.\n“I knew when he got back he might blow at any moment,” said Bannon after the\npresident returned from his Bedminster weekend.\n* * *\nOn Monday morning, May 8, in a meeting in the Oval Office, the president told Priebus\nand Bannon that he had made his decision: he would fire Director Comey. Both men again\nmade heated pleas against the move, arguing for, at the very least, more discussion. Here\nwas a key technique for managing the president: delay. Rolling something forward likely\nmeant that something else—an equal or greater fiasco—would come along to preempt\nwhatever fiasco was currently at hand. What’s more, delay worked advantageously with\nTrump’s attention span; whatever the issue of the moment, he would shortly be on to\nsomething else. When the meeting ended, Priebus and Bannon thought they had bought\nsome breathing room.\nLater that day, Sally Yates and former director of National Intelligence James Clapper\nappeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Crime and Terrorism subcommittee—\nand were greeted by a series of furious tweets from the president.\nHere was, Bannon saw again, the essential Trump problem. He hopelessly personalized\neverything. He saw the world in commercial and show business terms: someone else was\nalways trying to one-up you, someone else was always trying to take the limelight. The\nbattle was between you and someone else who wanted what you had. For Bannon,\nreducing the political world to face-offs and spats belittled the place in history Trump and\nhis administration had achieved. But it also belied the real powers they were up against.\nNot people—institutions.\nTo Trump, he was just up against Sally Yates, who was, he steamed, “such a cunt.”\nSince her firing on January 30, Yates had remained suspiciously quiet. When\njournalists approached her, she, or her intermediaries, explained that per her lawyers she\nwas shut down on all media. The president believed she was merely lying in wait. In\nphone calls to friends, he worried about her “plan” and “strategy,” and he continued to\npress his after-dinner sources for what they thought she and Ben Rhodes, Trump’s favorite\nObama plotter, had “up their sleeves.”\nFor each of his enemies—and, actually, for each of his friends—the issue for him came\ndown, in many ways, to their personal press plan. The media was the battlefield. Trump\nassumed everybody wanted his or her fifteen minutes and that everybody had a press\nstrategy for when they got them. If you couldn’t get press directly for yourself, you\nbecame a leaker. There was no happenstance news, in Trump’s view. All news was\nmanipulated and designed, planned and planted. All news was to some extent fake—he\nunderstood that very well, because he himself had faked it so many times in his career.\nThis was why he had so naturally cottoned to the “fake news” label. “I’ve made stuff up\nforever, and they always print it,” he bragged.\nThe return of Sally Yates, with her appointment before the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee, marked the beginning, Trump believed, of a sustained and well-organized\nmedia rollout for her. (His press view was confirmed later in May by a lavish,\nhagiographic profile of Yates in the New Yorker. “How long do you think she was\nplanning this?” he asked, rhetorically. “You know she was. It’s her payday.”) “Yates is\nonly famous because of me,” the president complained bitterly. “Otherwise, who is she?\nNobody.”\nIn front of Congress that Monday morning, Yates delivered a cinematic performance—\ncool, temperate, detailed, selfless—compounding Trump’s fury and agitation.\n* * *\nOn the morning of Tuesday, May 9, with the president still fixated on Comey, and with\nKushner and his daughter behind him, Priebus again moved to delay: “There’s a right way\nto do this and a wrong way to do this,” he told the president. “We don’t want him learning\nabout this on television. I’m going to say this one last time: this is not the right way to do\nthis. If you want to do this, the right way is to have him in and have a conversation. This is\nthe decent way and the professional way.” Once more, the president seemed to calm down\nand become more focused on the necessary process.\nBut that was a false flag. In fact, the president, in order to avoid embracing\nconventional process—or, for that matter, any real sense of cause and effect—merely\neliminated everybody else from his process. For most of the day, almost no one would\nknow that he had decided to take matters into his own hands. In presidential annals, the\nfiring of FBI director James Comey may be the most consequential move ever made by a\nmodern president acting entirely on his own.\nAs it happened, the Justice Department—Attorney General Sessions and Deputy\nAttorney General Rod Rosenstein—were, independent of the president’s own course,\npreparing their case against Comey. They would take the Bedminster line and blame\nComey for errors of his handling of the Clinton email mess—a problematic charge,\nbecause if that was truly the issue, why wasn’t Comey dismissed on that basis as soon as\nthe Trump administration took office? But in fact, quite regardless of the Sessions and\nRosenstein case, the president had determined to act on his own.\nJared and Ivanka were urging the president on, but even they did not know that the axe\nwould shortly fall. Hope Hicks, Trump’s steadfast shadow, who otherwise knew\neverything the president thought—not least because he was helpless not to express it out\nloud—didn’t know. Steve Bannon, however much he worried that the president might\nblow, didn’t know. His chief of staff didn’t know. And his press secretary didn’t know. The\npresident, on the verge of starting a war with the FBI, the DOJ, and many in Congress,\nwas going rogue.\nAt some point that afternoon Trump told his daughter and son-in-law about his plan.\nThey immediately became coconspirators and firmly shut out any competing advice.\nEerily, it was a notably on-time and unruffled day in the West Wing. Mark Halperin,\nthe political reporter and campaign chronicler, was waiting in the reception area for Hope\nHicks, who fetched him a bit before 5:00 p.m. Fox’s Howard Kurtz was there, too, waiting\nfor his appointment with Sean Spicer. And Reince Priebus’s assistant had just been out to\ntell his five o’clock appointment it would be only a few more minutes.\nJust before five, in fact, the president, having not too long before notified McGahn of\nhis intention, pulled the trigger. Trump’s personal security guard, Keith Schiller, delivered\nthe termination letter to Comey’s office at the FBI just after five o’clock. The letter’s\nsecond sentence included the words “You are hereby terminated and removed from office,\neffective immediately.”\nShortly thereafter, most of the West Wing staff, courtesy of an erroneous report from\nFox News, was for a brief moment under the impression that Comey had resigned. Then,\nin a series of information synapses throughout the offices of the West Wing, it became\nclear what had actually happened.\n“So next it’s a special prosecutor!” said Priebus in disbelief, to no one in particular,\nwhen he learned shortly before five o’clock what was happening.\nSpicer, who would later be blamed for not figuring out how to positively spin the\nComey firing, had only minutes to process it.\nNot only had the decision been made by the president with almost no consultation\nexcept that of his inner family circle, but the response, and explanation, and even legal\njustifications, were also almost exclusively managed by him and his family. Rosenstein\nand Sessions’s parallel rationale for the firing was shoehorned in at the last minute, at\nwhich point, at Kushner’s direction, the initial explanation of Comey’s firing became that\nthe president had acted solely on their recommendation. Spicer was forced to deliver this\nunlikely rationale, as was the vice president. But this pretense unraveled almost\nimmediately, not least because most everyone in the West Wing, wanting nothing to do\nwith the decision to fire Comey, was helping to unravel it.\nThe president, along with his family, stood on one side of the White House divide,\nwhile the staff—mouths agape, disbelieving and speechless—stood on the other.\nBut the president seemed also to want it known that he, aroused and dangerous,\npersonally took down Comey. Forget Rosenstein and Sessions, it was personal. It was a\npowerful president and a vengeful one, in every way galled and affronted by those in\npursuit of him, and determined to protect his family, who were in turn determined to have\nhim protect them.\n“The daughter will take down the father,” said Bannon, in a Shakespearian mood.\nWithin the West Wing there was much replaying of alternative scenarios. If you wanted\nto get rid of Comey, there were surely politic ways of doing it—which had in fact been\nsuggested to Trump. (A curious one—an idea that later would seem ironic—was to get rid\nof General Kelly at Homeland Security and move Comey into that job.) But the point\nreally was that Trump had wanted to confront and humiliate the FBI director. Cruelty was\na Trump attribute.\nThe firing had been carried out publicly and in front of his family—catching Comey\nentirely off guard as he gave a speech in California. Then the president had further\npersonalized the blow with an ad hominem attack on the director, suggesting that the FBI\nitself was on Trump’s side and that it, too, had only contempt for Comey.\nThe next day, as though to further emphasize and delight in both the insult and his\npersonal impunity, the president met with Russian bigwigs in the Oval Office, including\nRussia’s Ambassador Kislyak, the very focus of much of the Trump-Russia investigation.\nTo the Russians he said: “I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I\nfaced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” Then, to boot, he revealed\ninformation supplied to the United States by Israel from its agent in place in Syria about\nISIS using laptops to smuggle bombs onto airlines—revealing enough information to\ncompromise the Israeli agent. (This incident did not help Trump’s reputation in\nintelligence circles, since, in spycraft, human sources are to be protected above all other\nsecrets.)\n“It’s Trump,” said Bannon. “He thinks he can fire the FBI.”\n* * *\nTrump believed that firing Comey would make him a hero. Over the next forty-eight hours\nhe spun his side to various friends. It was simple: he had stood up to the FBI. He proved\nthat he was willing to take on the state power. The outsider against the insiders. After all,\nthat’s why he was elected.\nAt some level he had a point. One reason presidents don’t fire the director of the FBI is\nthat they fear the consequences. It’s the Hoover syndrome: any president can be hostage to\nwhat the FBI knows, and a president who treats the FBI with something less than\ndeference does so at his own peril. But this president had stood up to the feds. One man\nagainst the unaccountable power that the left had long railed against—and that more\nrecently the right had taken as a Holy Grail issue, too. “Everybody should be rooting for\nme,” the president said to friends, more and more plaintively.\nHere was another peculiar Trump attribute: an inability to see his actions the way most\nothers saw them. Or to fully appreciate how people expected him to behave. The notion of\nthe presidency as an institutional and political concept, with an emphasis on ritual and\npropriety and semiotic messaging—statesmanship—was quite beyond him.\nInside the government, the response to Comey’s firing was a kind of bureaucratic\nrevulsion. Bannon had tried to explain to Trump the essential nature of career government\nofficials, people whose comfort zone was in their association with hegemonic\norganizations and a sense of a higher cause—they were different, very different, from\nthose who sought individual distinction. Whatever else Comey might be, he was first and\nforemost a bureaucrat. Casting him ignominiously out was yet another Trump insult to the\nbureaucracy.\nRod Rosenstein, the author of the letter that ostensibly provided the justification for\nfiring Comey, now stood in the line of fire. The fifty-two-year-old Rosenstein, who, in\nrimless glasses, seemed to style himself as a bureaucrat’s bureaucrat, was the longestserving\nU.S. attorney in the country. He lived within the system, all by the book, his\nhighest goal seeming to be to have people say he did things by the book. He was a straight\nshooter—and he wanted everyone to know it.\nAll this was undermined by Trump—trashed, even. The brow-beating and snarling\npresident had hectored the country’s two top law enforcement officials into an illconsidered\nor, at the very least, an ill-timed indictment of the director of the FBI.\nRosenstein was already feeling used and abused. And then he was shown to have been\ntricked, too. He was a dupe.\nThe president had forced Rosenstein and Sessions to construct a legal rationale, yet\nthen he could not even maintain the bureaucratic pretense of following it. Having enlisted\nRosenstein and Sessions in his plot, Trump now exposed their efforts to present a\nreasonable and aboveboard case as a sham—and, arguably, a plan to obstruct justice. The\npresident made it perfectly clear that he hadn’t fired the director of the FBI because he did\nHillary wrong; he fired Comey because the FBI was too aggressively investigating him\nand his administration.\nHyper-by-the-book Rod Rosenstein—heretofore the quintessential apolitical player—\nimmediately became, in Washington eyes, a hopeless Trump tool. But Rosenstein’s\nrevenge was deft, swift, overwhelming, and (of course) by the book.\nGiven the decision of the attorney general to recuse himself from the Russia\ninvestigation, it fell under the authority of the deputy attorney general to determine\nwhether a conflict existed—that is, whether the deputy attorney general, because of selfinterest,\nmight not be able to act objectively—and if, in his sole discretion, he judged a\nconflict to exist, to appoint an outside special counsel with wide powers and\nresponsibilities to conduct an investigation and, potentially, a prosecution.\nOn May 17, twelve days after FBI director Comey was fired, without consulting the\nWhite House or the attorney general, Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert\nMueller to oversee the investigation of Trump’s, his campaign’s, and his staff’s ties to\nRussia. If Michael Flynn had recently become the most powerful man in Washington for\nwhat he might reveal about the president, now Mueller arguably assumed that position\nbecause he had the power to make Flynn, and all other assorted Trump cronies and\nflunkies, squeal.\nRosenstein, of course, perhaps with some satisfaction, understood that he had delivered\nwhat could be a mortal blow to the Trump presidency.\nBannon, shaking his head in wonder about Trump, commented drily: “He doesn’t\nnecessarily see what’s coming.”\n17\nABROAD AND AT HOME\nO\nn May 12, Roger Ailes was scheduled to return to New York from Palm Beach to\nmeet with Peter Thiel, an early and lonely Trump supporter in Silicon Valley who\nhad become increasingly astonished by Trump’s unpredictability. Ailes and Thiel, both\nworried that Trump could bring Trumpism down, were set to discuss the funding and\nlaunch of a new cable news network. Thiel would pay for it and Ailes would bring\nO’Reilly, Hannity, himself, and maybe Bannon to it.\nBut two days before the meeting, Ailes fell in his bathroom and hit his head. Before\nslipping into a coma, he told his wife not to reschedule the meeting with Thiel. A week\nlater, Ailes, that singular figure in the march from Nixon’s silent majority to Reagan’s\nDemocrats to Trump’s passionate base, was dead.\nHis funeral in Palm Beach on May 20 was quite a study in the currents of right-wing\nambivalence and even mortification. Right-wing professionals remained passionate in\ntheir outward defense of Trump but were rattled, if not abashed, among one another. At\nthe funeral, Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham struggled to parse support for Trumpism\neven as they distanced themselves from Trump himself.\nThe president had surely become the right wing’s meal ticket. He was the ultimate\nantiliberal: an authoritarian who was the living embodiment of resistance to authority. He\nwas the exuberant inverse of everything the right wing found patronizing and gullible and\nsanctimonious about the left. And yet, obviously, Trump was Trump—careless, capricious,\ndisloyal, far beyond any sort of control. Nobody knew that as well as the people who\nknew him best.\nAiles’s wife, Beth, had militantly invited only Ailes loyalists to the funeral. Anyone\nwho had wavered in her husband’s defense since his firing or had decided that a better\nfuture lay with the Murdoch family was excluded. This put Trump, still enthralled by his\nnew standing with Murdoch, on the other side of the line. Hours and then days—carefully\ntracked by Beth Ailes—ticked off without a condolence call from the president.\nThe morning of the funeral, Sean Hannity’s private plane took off for Palm Beach from\nRepublic Airport in Farmingdale, Long Island. Accompanying Hannity was a small group\nof current and former Fox employees, all Ailes and Trump partisans. But each felt some\nopen angst, or even incredulity, about Trump being Trump: first there was the difficulty of\ngrasping the Comey rationale, and now his failure to give even a nod to his late friend\nAiles.\n“He’s an idiot, obviously,” said the former Fox correspondent Liz Trotta.\nFox anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle spent much of the flight debating Trump’s entreaties to\nhave her replace Sean Spicer at the White House. “There are a lot of issues, including\npersonal survival.”\nAs for Hannity himself, his view of the right-wing world was shifting from Foxcentric\nto Trumpcentric. He did not think much more than a year would pass before he, too,\nwould be pushed from the network, or find it too inhospitable to stay on. And yet he was\npained by Trump’s slavish attentions to Murdoch, who had not only ousted Ailes but\nwhose conservatism was at best utilitarian. “He was for Hillary!” said Hannity.\nRuminating out loud, Hannity said he would leave the network and go work full time\nfor Trump, because nothing was more important than that Trump succeed—“in spite of\nhimself,” Hannity added, laughing.\nBut he was pissed off that Trump hadn’t called Beth. “Mueller,” he concluded, drawing\ndeeply on an electronic cigarette, had distracted him.\nTrump may be a Frankenstein creation, but he was the right wing’s creation, the first,\ntrue, right-wing original. Hannity could look past the Comey disaster. And Jared. And the\nmess in the White House.\nStill, he hadn’t called Beth.\n“What the fuck is wrong with him?” asked Hannity.\n* * *\nTrump believed he was one win away from turning everything around. Or, perhaps more\nto the point, one win away from good press that would turn everything around. The fact\nthat he had largely squandered his first hundred days—whose victories should have been\nthe currency of the next hundred days—was immaterial. You could be down in the media\none day and then the next have a hit that made you a success.\n“Big things, we need big things,” he said, angrily and often. “This isn’t big. I need big.\nBring me big. Do you even know what big is?”\nRepeal and replace, infrastructure, true tax reform—the rollout Trump had promised\nand then depended on Paul Ryan to deliver—was effectively in tatters. Every senior staff\nmember was now maintaining that they shouldn’t have done health care, the precursor to\nthe legislative rollout, in the first place. Whose idea was that, anyway?\nThe natural default might be to do smaller things, incremental versions of the program.\nBut Trump showed little interest in the small stuff. He became listless and irritable.\nSo, okay, it would have to be peace in the Middle East.\nFor Trump, as for many showmen or press release entrepreneurs, the enemy of\neverything is complexity and red tape, and the solution for everything is cutting corners.\nBypass or ignore the difficulties; just move in a straight line to the vision, which, if it’s\nbold enough, or grandiose enough, will sell itself. In this formula, there is always a series\nof middlemen who will promise to help you cut the corners, as well as partners who will\nbe happy to piggyback on your grandiosity.\nEnter the Crown Prince of the House of Saud, Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz\nAl Saud, age thirty-one. Aka MBS.\nThe fortuitous circumstance was that the king of Saudi Arabia, MBS’s father, was\nlosing it. The consensus in the Saudi royal family about a need to modernize was growing\nstronger (somewhat). MBS—an inveterate player of video games—was a new sort of\npersonality in the Saudi leadership. He was voluble, open, and expansive, a charmer and\nan international player, a canny salesman rather than a remote, taciturn grandee. He had\nseized the economic portfolio and was pursuing a vision—quite a Trumpian vision—to\nout-Dubai Dubai and diversify the economy. His would be a new, modern—well, a bit\nmore modern—kingdom (yes, women would soon be allowed to drive—so thank God\nself-driving cars were coming!). Saudi leadership was marked by age, traditionalism,\nrelative anonymity, and careful consensus thinking. The Saudi royal family, on the other\nhand, whence the leadership class comes, was often marked by excess, flash, and the\npartaking of the joys of modernity in foreign ports. MBS, a man in a hurry, was trying to\nbridge the Saudi royal selves.\nGlobal liberal leadership had been all but paralyzed by the election of Donald Trump—\nindeed, by the very existence of Donald Trump. But it was an inverted universe in the\nMiddle East. The Obama truculence and hyperrationalization and micromanaging,\npreceded by the Bush moral militarism and ensuing disruptions, preceded by Clinton deal\nmaking, quid pro quo, and backstabbing, had opened the way for Trump’s version of\nrealpolitik. He had no patience with the our-hands-are-tied ennui of the post-cold war\norder, that sense of the chess board locked in place, of incremental movement being the\nbest-case scenario—the alternative being only war. His was a much simpler view: Who’s\ngot the power? Give me his number.\nAnd, just as basically: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. If Trump had one fixed\npoint of reference in the Middle East, it was—mostly courtesy of Michael Flynn’s tutoring\n—that Iran was the bad guy. Hence everybody opposed to Iran was a pretty good guy.\nAfter the election, MBS had reached out to Kushner. In the confusion of the Trump\ntransition, nobody with foreign policy stature and an international network had been put in\nplace—even the new secretary of state designate, Rex Tillerson, had no real experience in\nforeign policy. To bewildered foreign secretaries, it seemed logical to see the\npresidentelect’s son-in-law as a figure of stability. Whatever happened, he would be there.\nAnd for certain regimes, especially the familycentric Saudis, Kushner, the son-in-law, was\nmuch more reassuring than a policy person. He wasn’t in his job because of his ideas.\nOf the many Trump gashes in modern major-power governing, you could certainly\ndrive a Trojan horse through his lack of foreign policy particulars and relationships. This\npresented a do-over opportunity for the world in its relationship with the United States—\nor it did if you were willing to speak the new Trump language, whatever that was. There\nwasn’t much of a road map here, just pure opportunism, a new transactional openness. Or,\neven more, a chance to use the powers of charm and seduction to which Trump responded\nas enthusiastically as he did to offers of advantageous new deals.\nIt was Kissingeresque realpolitik. Kissinger himself, long familiar with Trump by way\nof the New York social world and now taking Kushner under his wing, was successfully\nreinserting himself, helping to organize meetings with the Chinese and the Russians.\nMost of America’s usual partners, and even many antagonists, were unsettled if not\nhorrified. Still, some saw opportunity. The Russians could see a free pass on the Ukraine\nand Georgia, as well as a lifting of sanctions, in return for giving up on Iran and Syria.\nEarly in the transition, a high-ranking official in the Turkish government reached out in\ngenuine confusion to a prominent U.S. business figure to inquire whether Turkey would\nhave better leverage by putting pressure on the U.S. military presence in Turkey or by\noffering the new president an enviable hotel site on the Bosporus.\nThere was something curiously aligned between the Trump family and MBS. Like the\nentire Saudi leadership, MBS had, practically speaking, no education outside of Saudi\nArabia. In the past, this had worked to limit the Saudi options—nobody was equipped to\nconfidently explore new intellectual possibilities. As a consequence, everybody was wary\nof trying to get them to imagine change. But MBS and Trump were on pretty much equal\nfooting. Knowing little made them oddly comfortable with each other. When MBS offered\nhimself to Kushner as his guy in the Saudi kingdom, that was “like meeting someone nice\nat your first day of boarding school,” said Kushner’s friend.\nCasting aside, in very quick order, previously held assumptions—in fact, not really\naware of those assumptions—the new Trump thinking about the Middle East became the\nfollowing: There are basically four players (or at least we can forget everybody else)—\nIsrael, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. The first three can be united against the fourth. And\nEgypt and Saudi Arabia, given what they want with respect to Iran—and anything else\nthat does not interfere with the United States’ interests—will pressure the Palestinians to\nmake a deal. Voilà.\nThis represented a queasy-making mishmash of thought. Bannon’s isolationism (a pox\non all your houses—and keep us out of it); Flynn’s anti-Iranism (of all the world’s perfidy\nand toxicity, there is none like that of the mullahs); and Kushner’s Kissingerism (not so\nmuch Kissingerism as, having no point of view himself, a dutiful attempt to follow the\nninety-four-year-old’s advice).\nBut the fundamental point was that the last three administrations had gotten the Middle\nEast wrong. It was impossible to overstate how much contempt the Trump people felt for\nthe business-as-usual thinking that had gotten it so wrong. Hence, the new operating\nprinciple was simple: do the opposite of what they (Obama, but the Bush neocons, too)\nwould do. Their behavior, their conceits, their ideas—in some sense even their\nbackgrounds, education, and class—were all suspect. And, what’s more, you don’t really\nhave to know all that much yourself; you just do it differently than it was done before.\nThe old foreign policy was based on the idea of nuance: facing an infinitely complex\nmultilateral algebra of threats, interests, incentives, deals, and ever evolving relationships,\nwe strain to reach a balanced future. In practice, the new foreign policy, an effective\nTrump doctrine, was to reduce the board to three elements: powers we can work with,\npowers we cannot work with, and those without enough power whom we can functionally\ndisregard or sacrifice. It was cold war stuff. And, indeed, in the larger Trump view, it was\nduring the cold war that time and circumstance gave the United States its greatest global\nadvantage. That was when America was great.\n* * *\nKushner was the driver of the Trump doctrine. His test cases were China, Mexico, Canada,\nand Saudi Arabia. He offered each country the opportunity to make his father-in-law\nhappy.\nIn the first days of the administration, Mexico blew its chance. In transcripts of\nconversations between Trump and Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto that would later\nbecome public, it was vividly clear that Mexico did not understand or was unwilling to\nplay the new game. The Mexican president refused to construct a pretense for paying for\nthe wall, a pretense that might have redounded to his vast advantage (without his having to\nactually pay for the wall).\nNot long after, Canada’s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, a forty-five-year-old\nglobalist in the style of Clinton and Blair, came to Washington and repeatedly smiled and\nbit his tongue. And that did the trick: Canada quickly became Trump’s new best friend.\nThe Chinese, who Trump had oft maligned during the campaign, came to Mar-a-Lago\nfor a summit advanced by Kushner and Kissinger. (This required some tutoring for Trump,\nwho referred to the Chinese leader as “Mr. X-i”; the president was told to think of him as a\nwoman and call him “she.”) They were in an agreeable mood, evidently willing to humor\nTrump. And they quickly figured out that if you flatter him, he flatters you.\nBut it was the Saudis, also often maligned during the campaign, who, with their\nintuitive understanding of family, ceremony, and ritual and propriety, truly scored.\nThe foreign policy establishment had a long and well-honed relationship with MBS’s\nrival, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef (MBN). Key NSA and State Department\nfigures were alarmed that Kushner’s discussions and fast-advancing relationship with\nMBS would send a dangerous message to MBN. And of course it did. The foreign policy\npeople believed Kushner was being led by MBS, whose real views were entirely untested.\nThe Kushner view was either, naïvely, that he wasn’t being led, or, with the confidence of\na thirty-six-year-old assuming the new prerogatives of the man in charge, that he didn’t\ncare: let’s embrace anybody who will embrace us.\nThe Kushner/MBS plan that emerged was straightforward in a way that foreign policy\nusually isn’t: If you give us what we want, we’ll give you what you want. On MBS’s\nassurance that he would deliver some seriously good news, he was invited to visit the\nWhite House in March. (The Saudis arrived with a big delegation, but they were received\nat the White House by only the president’s small circle—and the Saudis took particular\nnote that Trump ordered Priebus to jump up and fetch him things during the meeting.) The\ntwo large men, the older Trump and much younger MBS—both charmers, flatterers, and\ncountry club jokers, each in their way—grandly hit it off.\nIt was an aggressive bit of diplomacy. MBS was using this Trump embrace as part of\nhis own power play in the kingdom. And the Trump White House, ever denying this was\nthe case, let him. In return, MBS offered a basket of deals and announcements that would\ncoincide with a scheduled presidential visit to Saudi Arabia—Trump’s first trip abroad.\nTrump would get a “win.”\nPlanned before the Comey firing and Mueller hiring, the trip had State Department\nprofessionals alarmed. The itinerary—May 19 to May 27—was too long for any president,\nparticularly such an untested and untutored one. (Trump himself, full of phobias about\ntravel and unfamiliar locations, had been grumbling about the burdens of the trip.) But\ncoming immediately after Comey and Mueller it was a get-out-of-Dodge godsend. There\ncouldn’t have been a better time to be making headlines far from Washington. A road trip\ncould transform everything.\nAlmost the entire West Wing, along with State Department and National Security staff,\nwas on board for the trip: Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Reince Priebus,\nStephen Bannon, Gary Cohn, Dina Powell, Hope Hicks, Sean Spicer, Stephen Miller, Joe\nHagin, Rex Tillerson, and Michael Anton. Also included were Sarah Huckabee Sanders,\nthe deputy press secretary; Dan Scavino, the administration’s social media director; Keith\nSchiller, the president’s personal security adviser; and Wilbur Ross, the commerce\nsecretary. (Ross was widely ridiculed for never missing an Air Force One opportunity—as\nBannon put it, “Wilbur is Zelig, every time you turn around he’s in a picture.”) This trip\nand the robust American delegation was the antidote, and alternate universe to the Mueller\nappointment.\nThe president and his son-in-law could barely contain their confidence and enthusiasm.\nThey felt certain that they had set out on the road to peace in the Middle East—and in this,\nthey were much like a number of other administrations that had come before them.\nTrump was effusive in his praise for Kushner. “Jared’s gotten the Arabs totally on our\nside. Done deal,” he assured one of his after-dinner callers before leaving on the trip. “It’s\ngoing to be beautiful.”\n“He believed,” said the caller, “that this trip could pull it out, like a twist in a bad\nmovie.”\n* * *\nOn the empty roads of Riyadh, the presidential motorcade passed billboards with pictures\nof Trump and the Saudi king (MBS’s eighty-one-year-old father) with the legend\nTOGETHER WE PREVAIL.\nIn part, the president’s enthusiasm seemed to be born out of—or perhaps had caused—\na substantial exaggeration of what had actually been agreed to during the negotiations\nahead of the trip. In the days before his departure, he was telling people that the Saudis\nwere going to finance an entirely new military presence in the kingdom, supplanting and\neven replacing the U.S. command headquarters in Qatar. And there would be “the biggest\nbreakthrough in Israel-Palestine negotiations ever.” It would be “the game changer, major\nlike has never been seen.”\nIn truth, his version of what would be accomplished was a quantum leap beyond what\nwas actually agreed, but that did not seem to alter his feelings of zeal and delight.\nThe Saudis would immediately buy $110 billion’s worth of American arms, and a total\nof $350 billion over ten years. “Hundreds of billions of dollars of investments into the\nUnited States and jobs, jobs, jobs,” declared the president. Plus, the Americans and the\nSaudis would together “counter violent extremist messaging, disrupt financing of\nterrorism, and advance defense cooperation.” And they would establish a center in Riyadh\nto fight extremism. And if this was not exactly peace in the Middle East, the president,\naccording to the secretary of state, “feels like there’s a moment in time here. The\npresident’s going to talk with Netanyahu about the process going forward. He’s going to\nbe talking to President Abbas about what he feels is necessary for the Palestinians to be\nsuccessful.”\nIt was all a Trumpian big deal. Meanwhile, the First Family—POTUS, FLOTUS, and\nJared and Ivanka—were ferried around in gold golf carts, and the Saudis threw a $75\nmillion party in Trump’s honor, with Trump getting to sit on a thronelike chair. (The\npresident, while receiving an honor from the Saudi king, appeared in a photograph to have\nbowed, arousing some right-wing ire.)\nFifty Arab and Muslim nations were summoned by the Saudis to pay the president\ncourt. The president called home to tell his friends how natural and easy this was, and\nhow, inexplicably and suspiciously, Obama had messed it all up. There “has been a little\nstrain, but there won’t be strain with this administration,” the president assured Hamad bin\nIsa Al Khalifa, the king of Bahrain.\nAbdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian strongman, ably stroked the president and said, “You\nare a unique personality that is capable of doing the impossible.” (To Sisi, Trump replied,\n“Love your shoes. Boy, those shoes. Man… .”)\nIt was, in dramatic ways, a shift in foreign policy attitude and strategy—and its effects\nwere almost immediate. The president, ignoring if not defying foreign policy advice, gave\na nod to the Saudis’ plan to bully Qatar. Trump’s view was that Qatar was providing\nfinancial support to terror groups—pay no attention to a similar Saudi history. (Only some\nmembers of the Saudi royal family had provided such support, went the new reasoning.)\nWithin weeks of the trip, MBS, detaining MBN quite in the dead of night, would force\nhim to relinquish the Crown Prince title, which MBS would then assume for himself.\nTrump would tell friends that he and Jared had engineered this: “We’ve put our man on\ntop!”\nFrom Riyadh, the presidential party went on to Jerusalem, where the president met\nwith Netanyahu and, in Bethlehem, with Abbas, expressing ever greater certainty that, in\nhis third-person guise, “Trump will make peace.” Then to Rome to meet the pope. Then to\nBrussels, where, in character, he meaningfully drew the line between Western-alliancebased\nforeign policy, which had been firmly in place since World War II, and the new\nAmerica First ethos.\nIn Trump’s view, all this should have been presidency-shaping stuff. He couldn’t\nbelieve his dramatic accomplishments weren’t getting bigger play. He was simply in\ndenial, Bannon, Priebus, and others noted, about the continuing and competing Comey\nand Mueller headlines.\nOne of Trump’s deficiencies—a constant in the campaign and, so far, in the presidency\n—was his uncertain grasp of cause and effect. Until now, whatever problems he might\nhave caused in the past had reliably been supplanted by new events, giving him the\nconfidence that one bad story can always be replaced by a better, more dramatic story. He\ncould always change the conversation. The Saudi trip and his bold campaign to upend the\nold foreign policy world order should have accomplished exactly that. But the president\ncontinued to find himself trapped, incredulously on his part, by Comey and Mueller.\nNothing seemed to move on from those two events.\nAfter the Saudi leg of the trip, Bannon and Priebus, both exhausted by the trip’s intense\nproximity to the president and his family, peeled off and headed back to Washington. It\nwas now their job to deal with what had become, in the White House staff’s absence, the\nactual, even ultimate, presidency-shaping crisis.\n* * *\nWhat did the people around Trump actually think of Trump? This was not just a\nreasonable question, it was the question those around Trump most asked themselves. They\nconstantly struggled to figure out what they themselves actually thought and what they\nthought everybody else was truly thinking.\nMostly they kept their answers to themselves, but in the instance of Comey and\nMueller, beyond all the usual dodging and weaving rationalizations, there really wasn’t\nanybody, other than the president’s family, who didn’t very pointedly blame Trump\nhimself.\nThis was the point at which an emperors-new-clothes threshold was crossed. Now you\ncould, out loud, rather freely doubt his judgment, acumen, and, most of all, the advice he\nwas getting.\n“He’s not only crazy,” declared Tom Barrack to a friend, “he’s stupid.”\nBut Bannon, along with Priebus, had strongly opposed the Comey firing, while Ivanka\nand Jared had not only supported it, but insisted on it. This seismic event prompted a new\ntheme from Bannon, repeated by him widely, which was that every piece of advice from\nthe couple was bad advice.\nNobody now believed that firing Comey was a good idea; even the president seemed\nsheepish. Hence, Bannon saw his new role as saving Trump—and Trump would always\nneed saving. He might be a brilliant actor but he could not manage his own career.\nAnd for Bannon, this new challenge brought a clear benefit: when Trump’s fortune\nsank, Bannon’s rose.\nOn the trip to the Middle East, Bannon went to work. He became focused on the figure\nof Lanny Davis, one of the Clinton impeachment lawyers who, for the better part of two\nyears, became a near round-the-clock spokesperson and public defender of the Clinton\nWhite House. Bannon judged Comey-Mueller to be as threatening to the Trump White\nHouse as Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr were to the Clinton White House, and he saw\nthe model for escaping a mortal fate in the Clinton response.\n“What the Clintons did was to go to the mattresses with amazing discipline,” he\nexplained. “They set up an outside shop and then Bill and Hillary never mentioned it\nagain. They ground through it. Starr had them dead to rights and they got through it.”\nBannon knew exactly what needed to be done: seal off the West Wing and build a\nseparate legal and communications staff to defend the president. In this construct, the\npresident would occupy a parallel reality, removed from and uninvolved with what would\nbecome an obvious partisan blood sport—as it had in the Clinton model. Politics would be\nrelegated to its nasty corner, and Trump would conduct himself as the president and as the\ncommander in chief.\n“So we’re going to do it,” insisted Bannon, with joie de guerre and manic energy, “the\nway they did it. Separate war room, separate lawyers, separate spokespeople. It’s keeping\nthat fight over there so we can wage this other fight over here. Everybody gets this. Well,\nmaybe not Trump so much. Not clear. Maybe a little. Not what he imagined.”\nBannon, in great excitement, and Priebus, grateful for an excuse to leave the\npresident’s side, rushed back to the West Wing to begin to cordon it off.\nIt did not escape Priebus’s notice that Bannon had in mind to create a rear guard of\ndefenders—David Bossie, Corey Lewandowski, and Jason Miller, all of whom would be\noutside spokespeople—that would largely be loyal to him. Most of all, it did not escape\nPriebus that Bannon was asking the president to play a role entirely out of character: the\ncool, steady, long-suffering chief executive.\nAnd it certainly didn’t help that they were unable to hire a law firm with a top-notch\nwhite-collar government practice. By the time Bannon and Priebus were back in\nWashington, three blue-chip firms had said no. All of them were afraid they would face a\nrebellion among the younger staff if they represented Trump, afraid Trump would publicly\nhumiliate them if the going got tough, and afraid Trump would stiff them for the bill.\nIn the end, nine top firms turned them down.\n18\nBANNON REDUX\nB\nannon was back, according to the Bannon faction. According to Bannon himself:\n“I’m good. I’m good. I’m back. I said don’t do it. You don’t fire the director of the\nFBI. The geniuses around here thought otherwise.”\nWas Bannon back? asked the worried other side of the house—Jared and Ivanka, Dina\nPowell, Gary Cohn, Hope Hicks, H. R. McMaster.\nIf he was back, that meant he had successfully defied the organizational premise of the\nTrump White House: the family would always prevail. Steve Bannon had, even in his\ninternal exile, not stopped his running public verbal assault on Jared and Ivanka. Off the\nrecord became Bannon’s effective on the record. These were bitter, sometimes hilarious,\ndenunciations of the couple’s acumen, intelligence, and motives: “They think they’re\ndefending him, but they are always defending themselves.”\nNow he declared they were finished as a power center—destroyed. And if not, they\nwould destroy the president with their terrible and self-serving advice. Even worse than\nJared was Ivanka. “She was a nonevent on the campaign. She became a White House\nstaffer and that’s when people suddenly realized she’s dumb as a brick. A little marketing\nsavvy and has a look, but as far as understanding actually how the world works and what\npolitics is and what it means—nothing. Once you expose that, you lose such credibility.\nJared just kind of flits in and does the Arab stuff.”\nThe folks on the Jarvanka side seemed more and more genuinely afraid of what might\nhappen if they crossed the Bannon side. Because the Bannonites, they truly seemed to\nfear, were assassins.\nOn the flight to Riyadh, Dina Powell approached Bannon about a leak involving her to\na right-wing news site. She told him she knew the leak had come from Julia Hahn, one of\nBannon’s people and a former Breitbart writer.\n“You should take it up with her,” said an amused Bannon. “But she’s a beast. And she\nwill come at you. Let me know how it works out.”\nAmong Bannon’s many regular targets, Powell had become a favorite. She was often\nbilled as Deputy National Security Advisor; that was her sometime designation even in the\nNew York Times. Actually, she was Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy—the\ndifference, Bannon pointed out, between the COO of a hotel chain and the concierge.\nComing back from the overseas trip, Powell began to talk in earnest to friends about\nher timetable to get out of the White House and back into a private-sector job. Sheryl\nSandberg, she said, was her model.\n“Oh my fucking god,” said Bannon.\nOn May 26, the day before the presidential party returned from the overseas trip, the\nWashington Post reported that during the transition, Kushner and Sergey Kislyak, the\nRussian ambassador, had, at Kushner’s instigation, discussed the possibility of having the\nRussians set up a private communications channel between the transition team and the\nKremlin. The Post cited “U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports.” The Jarvanka side\nbelieved that Bannon was the source.\nPart of the by now deep enmity between the First Family couple and their allies and\nBannon and his team was the Jarvanka conviction that Bannon had played a part in many\nof the reports of Kushner’s interactions with the Russians. This was not, in other words,\nmerely an internal policy war; it was a death match. For Bannon to live, Kushner would\nhave to be wholly discredited—pilloried, investigated, possibly even jailed.\nBannon, assured by everyone that there was no winning against the Trump family,\nhardly tried to hide his satisfied belief that he was going to outplay them. In the Oval\nOffice, in front of her father, Bannon openly attacked her. “You,” he said, pointing at her\nas the president watched, “are a fucking liar.” Ivanka’s bitter complaints to her father,\nwhich in the past had diminished Bannon, were now met by a hands-off Trump: “I told\nyou this is a tough town, baby.”\n* * *\nBut if Bannon was back, it was far from clear what being back meant. Trump being\nTrump, was this true rehabilitation, or did he feel an even deeper rancor toward Bannon\nfor having survived his initial intention to kill him? Nobody really thought Trump forgot\n—instead, he dwelled and ruminated and chewed. “One of the worst things is when he\nbelieves you’ve succeeded at his expense,” explained Sam Nunberg, once on the inside of\nthe Trump circle, then cast to the outside. “If your win is in any way perceived as his loss,\nphew.”\nFor his part, Bannon believed he was back because, at a pivotal moment, his advice\nhad proved vastly better than that of the “geniuses.” Firing Comey, the solve-all-problems\nJarvanka solution, had indeed unleashed a set of terrible consequences.\nThe Jarvanka side believed that Bannon was in essence blackmailing the president. As\nBannon went, so went the virulence of right-wing digital media. Despite his apparent\nobsession with the “fake news” put out by the New York Times, the Washington Post, and\nCNN, for the president the threat of fake news was actually greater on the right. Though\nhe would never call out fake news on Fox, Breitbart, and the others, these outlets—which\ncould conceivably spew a catchall of conspiracies in which a weak Trump sold out to a\npowerful establishment—were potentially far more dangerous than their counterparts on\nthe left.\nBannon, too, was seen to be rectifying an earlier bureaucratic mistake. Where initially\nhe had been content to be the brains of the operation—confident that he was vastly smarter\nthan everybody else (and, indeed, few tried to challenge him for that title)—and not staff\nup, now he was putting his organization and loyalists firmly in place. His off-balancesheet\ncommunications staff—Bossie, Lewandowski, Jason Miller, Sam Nunberg (even\nthough he had long fallen out with Trump himself), and Alexandra Preate—formed quite a\nprivate army of leakers and defenders. What’s more, whatever breach there had been\nbetween Bannon and Priebus came smoothly together over their mutual loathing of Jared\nand Ivanka. The professional White House was united against the amateur family White\nHouse.\nAdding to Bannon’s new bureaucratic advantage, he had maximum influence on the\nstaffing of the new firewall team, the lawyers and comm staff who would collectively\nbecome the Lanny Davis of the Trump defense. Unable to hire prestige talent, Bannon\nturned to one of the president’s longtime hit-man lawyers, Marc Kasowitz. Bannon had\npreviously bonded with Kasowitz when the attorney had handled a series of near-death\nproblems on the campaign, including dealing with a vast number of allegations and legal\nthreats from an ever growing list of women accusing Trump of molesting and harassing\nthem.\nOn May 31, the Bannon firewall plan went into effect. Henceforth, all discussion\nrelated to Russia, the Mueller and congressional investigations, and other personal legal\nissues would be entirely handled by the Kasowitz team. The president, as Bannon\ndescribed the plan in private and as he urged his boss, would no longer be addressing any\nof these areas. Among the many, many efforts to force Trump into presidential mode, this\nwas the latest.\nBannon then installed Mark Corallo, a former Karl Rove communications staffer, as\nthe firewall spokesperson. He was also planning to put in Bossie and Lewandowski as part\nof the crisis management team. And at Bannon’s prompting, Kasowitz attempted to further\ninsulate the president by giving his client a central piece of advice: send the kids home.\nBannon was indeed back. It was his team. It was his wall around the president—one\nthat he hoped would keep Jarvanka out.\nBannon’s formal moment of being back was marked by a major milestone. On June 1,\nafter a long and bitter internal debate, the president announced that he had decided to\nwithdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. For Bannon, it was a deeply satisfying slap\nin the face of liberal rectitude—Elon Musk and Bob Iger immediately resigned from\nTrump’s business council—and confirmation of Trump’s true Bannonite instincts.\nIt was, likewise, the move that Ivanka Trump had campaigned hardest against in the\nWhite House.\n“Score,” said Bannon. “The bitch is dead.”\n* * *\nThere are few modern political variables more disruptive than a dedicated prosecutor. It’s\nthe ultimate wild card.\nA prosecutor means that the issue under investigation—or, invariably, cascading issues\n—will be a constant media focus. Setting their own public stage, prosecutors are certain\nleakers.\nIt means that everybody in a widening circle has to hire a lawyer. Even tangential\ninvolvement can cost six figures; central involvement quickly rises into the millions.\nBy early summer, there was already an intense seller’s market in Washington for top\ncriminal legal talent. As the Mueller investigation got under way, White House staffers\nmade a panicky rush to get the best firm before someone else got there first and created a\nconflict.\n“Can’t talk about Russia, nothing, can’t go there,” said Katie Walsh, now three months\nremoved from the White House, on advice of her new counsel.\nAny interviews or depositions given to investigators risked putting you in jeopardy.\nWhat’s more, every day in the White House brought new dangers: any random meeting\nyou might find yourself in exposed you more.\nBannon kept insisting on the absolute importance of this point—and for him the\nstrategic importance. If you didn’t want to find yourself getting wrung out in front of\nCongress, your career and your net worth in jeopardy, be careful who you spoke to. More\nto the point: you must not under any circumstances speak to Jared and Ivanka, who were\nnow Russia toxic. It was Bannon’s widely advertised virtue and advantage: “I’ve never\nbeen to Russia. I don’t know anybody from Russia. I’ve never spoken to any Russians.\nAnd I’d just as well not speak to anyone who has.”\nBannon observed a hapless Pence in a lot of “wrong meetings,” and helped to bring in\nthe Republican operative Nick Ayers as Pence’s chief of staff, and to get “our fallback\nguy” out of the White House and “running around the world and looking like a vice\npresident.”\nAnd beyond the immediate fears and disruption, there was the virtually certain\noutcome that a special prosecutor delegated to find a crime would find one—likely many.\nEverybody became a potential agent of implicating others. Dominos would fall. Targets\nwould flip.\nPaul Manafort, making a good living in international financial gray areas, his risk\ncalculation based on the long-shot odds that an under-the-radar privateer would ever\nreceive close scrutiny, would now be subjected to microscopic review. His nemesis, Oleg\nDeripaska—still pursuing his $17 million claim against Manafort and himself looking for\nfavorable treatment from federal authorities who had restricted his travel to the United\nStates—was continuing his own deep investigation into Manafort’s Russian and Ukrainian\nbusiness affairs.\nTom Barrack, privy to the president’s stream of consciousness as well as his financial\nhistory, was suddenly taking stock of his own exposure. Indeed, all the billionaire friends\nwith whom Trump got on the phone and gossiped and rambled were potential witnesses.\nIn the past, administrations forced to deal with a special prosecutor appointed to\ninvestigate and prosecute matters with which the president might have been involved\nusually became consumed by the effort to cope. Their tenure broke into “before” and\n“after” periods—with the “after” period hopelessly bogged down in the soap opera of G-\nman pursuit. Now it looked like the “after” period would be almost the entirety of the\nTrump administration.\nThe idea of formal collusion and artful conspiracy—as media and Democrats more or\nless breathlessly believed or hoped had happened between Trump and the Russians—\nseemed unlikely to everybody in the White House. (Bannon’s comment that the Trump\ncampaign was not organized enough to collude with its own state organizations became\neverybody’s favorite talking point—not least because it was true.) But nobody was\nvouching for the side deals and freelance operations and otherwise nothing-burger stuff\nthat was a prosecutor’s daily bread and the likely detritus of the Trump hangers-on. And\neverybody believed that if the investigation moved into the long chain of Trump financial\ntransactions, it would almost certainly reach the Trump family and the Trump White\nHouse.\nAnd then there was the president’s insistent claim that he could do something. I can\nfire him, he would say. Indeed, it was another of his repetitive loops: I can fire him. I can\nfire him. Mueller. The idea of a showdown in which the stronger, more determined, more\nintransigent, more damn-the-consequences man prevails was central to Trump’s own\npersonal mythology. He lived in a mano a mano world, one in which if your own\nrespectability and sense of personal dignity were not a paramount issue—if you weren’t\nweak in the sense of needing to seem like a reasonable and respectable person—you had a\nterrific advantage. And if you made it personal, if you believed that when the fight really\nmattered that it was kill or be killed, you were unlikely to meet someone willing to make it\nas personal as you were.\nThis was Bannon’s fundamental insight about Trump: he made everything personal,\nand he was helpless not to.\n* * *\nDissuaded by everyone from focusing his anger on Mueller (at least for now), the\npresident focused on Sessions.\nSessions—“Beauregard”—was a close Bannon ally, and in May and June the\npresident’s almost daily digs against the attorney general—beyond even his loyalty and\nresolve, Trump issued scathing criticism of his stature, voice, and dress—provided a\nsudden bit of good news for the anti-Bannon side of the house. Bannon, they reasoned,\ncouldn’t really be on top if his key proxy was now being blamed for everything bad in\nTrump’s life. As always, Trump’s regard or scorn was infectious. If you were in favor,\nthen whatever and whomever he associated with you was also in favor. If you weren’t,\nthen everything associated with you was poisonous.\nThe brutality of Trump’s dissatisfaction kept increasing. A small man with a Mr.\nMagoo stature and an old-fashioned Southern accent, Sessions was bitterly mocked by the\npresident, who drew a corrosive portrait of physical and mental weakness. Insult trauma\nradiated out of the Oval Office. You could hear it when passing by.\nBannon’s efforts to talk the president down—reminding Trump of the difficulties they\nwould encounter during another attorney general confirmation, the importance of Sessions\nto the hard conservative base, the loyalty that Sessions had shown during the Trump\ncampaign—backfired. To the anti-Bannon side’s satisfaction, they resulted in another\nround of Trump’s dissing Bannon.\nThe attack on Sessions now became, at least in the president’s mind, the opening salvo\nin an active effort to replace Sessions as attorney general. But there were only two\ncandidates to run the Justice Department from whom Trump believed he could extract\nabsolute loyalty, Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani. He believed they would both perform\nkamikaze acts for him—just as everyone else knew they would almost certainly never be\nconfirmed.\n* * *\nAs James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee approached—it\nwould take place on June 8, twelve days after the presidential traveling party returned\nhome from the long trip to the Middle East and Europe—there began among senior\nstaffers an almost open inquiry into Trump’s motives and state of mind.\nThis seemed spurred by an obvious question: Why hadn’t he fired Comey during his\nfirst days of office, when it would likely have been seen as a natural changing of the guard\nwith no clear connection to the Russian investigation? There were many equivocal\nanswers: general disorganization, the fast pace of events, and a genuine sense of innocence\nand naïveté about the Russian charges. But now there seemed to be a new understanding:\nDonald Trump believed he had vastly more power, authority, and control than in fact he\nhad, and he believed his talent for manipulating people and bending and dominating them\nwas vastly greater than it was. Pushing this line of reasoning just a little further: senior\nstaff believed the president had a problem with reality, and reality was now overwhelming\nhim.\nIf true, this notion directly contravened the basic premise of the support for Trump\namong his staff. In some sense, not too closely questioned, they believed he had almost\nmagical powers. Since his success was not explainable, he must have talents beyond what\nthey could fathom. His instincts. Or his salesman’s gifts. Or his energy. Or just the fact\nthat he was the opposite of what he was supposed to be. This was out-of-the-ordinary\npolitics—shock-to-the-system politics—but it could work.\nBut what if it didn’t? What if they were all profoundly wrong?\nComey’s firing and the Mueller investigation prompted a delayed reckoning that ended\nmonths of willing suspension of disbelief. These sudden doubts and considerations—at the\nhighest level of government—did not quite yet go to the president’s ability to adequately\nfunction in his job. But they did, arguably for the first time in open discussions, go to the\nview that he was hopelessly prone to self-sabotaging his ability to function in the job. This\ninsight, scary as it was, at least left open the possibility that if all the elements of selfsabotage\nwere carefully controlled—his information, his contacts, his public remarks, and\nthe sense of danger and threat to him—he might yet be able to pull it together and\nsuccessfully perform.\nQuite suddenly, this became the prevailing view of the Trump presidency and the\nopportunity that still beckoned: you can be saved by those around you or brought down by\nthem.\nBannon believed the Trump presidency would fail in some more or less apocalyptic\nfashion if Kushner and his wife remained Trump’s most influential advisers. Their lack of\npolitical or real-world experience had already hobbled the presidency, but since the\nComey disaster it was getting worse: as Bannon saw it, they were now acting out of\npersonal panic.\nThe Kushner side believed that Bannon or Bannonism had pushed the president into a\nharshness that undermined his natural salesman’s abilities to charm and reach out. Bannon\nand his ilk had made him the monster he more and more seemed to be.\nMeanwhile, virtually everybody believed that a large measure of the fault lay in Reince\nPriebus, who had failed to create a White House that could protect the president from\nhimself—or from Bannon or from his own children. At the same time, believing that the\nfundamental problem lay in Priebus was easy scapegoating, not to mention little short of\nrisible: with so little power, the chief of staff simply wasn’t capable of directing either\nTrump or those around him. Priebus himself could, not too helpfully, argue only that no\none had any idea how much worse all this would have been without his long-suffering\nmediation among the president’s relatives, his Svengali, and Trump’s own terrible\ninstincts. There might be two or three debacles a day, but without Priebus’s stoic resolve,\nand the Trump blows that he absorbed, there might have been a dozen more.\n* * *\nOn June 8, from a little after ten in the morning to nearly one in the afternoon, James\nComey testified in public before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The former FBI\ndirector’s testimony, quite a tour de force of directness, moral standing, personal honor,\nand damning details, left the country with a simple message: the president was likely a\nfool and certainly a liar. In the age of modern media politesse, few presidents had been so\ndirectly challenged and impugned before Congress.\nHere it was, stark in Comey’s telling: the president regarded the FBI director as\nworking directly for him, of owing his job to him, and now he wanted something back.\n“My common sense,” said Comey, “again, I could be wrong, but my common sense told\nme what’s going on here is he’s looking to get something in exchange for granting my\nrequest to stay in the job.”\nIn Comey’s telling, the president wanted the FBI to lay off Michael Flynn. And he\nwanted to stop the FBI from pursuing its Russia-related investigation. The point could\nhardly have been clearer: if the president was pressuring the director because he feared\nthat an investigation of Michael Flynn would damage him, then this was an obstruction of\njustice.\nThe contrast between the two men, Comey and Trump, was in essence the contrast\nbetween good government and Trump himself. Comey came across as precise,\ncompartmentalized, scrupulous in his presentation of the details of what transpired and the\nnature of his responsibility—he was as by-the-book as it gets. Trump, in the portrait\noffered by Comey, was shady, shoot-from-the-hip, heedless or even unaware of the rules,\ndeceptive, and in it for himself.\nAfter the hearing ended, the president told everybody he had not watched it, but\neverybody knew he had. To the extent that this was, as Trump saw it, a contest between\nthe two men, it was as direct a juxtaposition as might be imagined. The entire point of the\nComey testimony was to recast and contradict what the president had said in his angry and\ndefensive tweets and statements, and to cast suspicion on his actions and motives—and to\nsuggest that the president’s intention was to suborn the director of the FBI.\nEven among Trump loyalists who believed, as Trump did, that Comey was a phony and\nthis was all a put-up job, the nearly universal feeling was that in this mortal game, Trump\nwas quite defenseless.\n* * *\nFive days later, on June 13, it was Jeff Sessions’s turn to testify before the Senate\nIntelligence Committee. His task was to try to explain the contacts he had had with the\nRussian ambassador, contacts that had later caused him to recuse himself—and made him\nthe president’s punching bag. Unlike Comey, who had been invited to the Senate to show\noff his virtue—and had seized the opportunity—Sessions had been invited to defend his\nequivocation, deception, or stupidity.\nIn an often testy exchange, the attorney general provided a squirrelly view of executive\nprivilege. Though the president had not in fact evoked executive privilege, Sessions\ndeemed it appropriate to try to protect it anyway.\nBannon, watching the testimony from the West Wing, quickly became frustrated.\n“Come on, Beauregard,” he said.\nUnshaven, Bannon sat at the head of the long wooden conference table in the chief of\nstaff’s office and focused intently on the flat-screen monitor across the room.\n“They thought the cosmopolitans would like it if we fired Comey,” he said, with “they”\nbeing Jared and Ivanka. “The cosmopolitans would be cheering for us for taking down the\nman who took Hillary down.” Where the president saw Sessions as the cause of the\nComey fiasco, Bannon saw Sessions as a victim of it.\nA sylphlike Kushner, wearing a skinny gray suit and skinny black tie, slipped into the\nroom. (Recently making the rounds was a joke about Kushner being the best-dressed man\nin Washington, which is quite the opposite of a compliment.) On occasion the power\nstruggle between Bannon and Kushner seemed to take physical form. Bannon’s demeanor\nrarely changed, but Kushner could be petulant, condescending, and dismissive—or, as he\nwas now, hesitating, abashed, and respectful.\nBannon ignored Kushner until the younger man cleared his throat. “How’s it going?”\nBannon indicated the television set: as in, Watch for yourself.\nFinally Bannon spoke. “They don’t realize this is about institutions, not people.”\n“They” would appear to be the Jarvanka side—or an even broader construct referring\nto all those who mindlessly stood with Trump.\n“This town is about institutions,” Bannon continued. “We fire the FBI director and we\nfire the whole FBI. Trump is a man against institutions, and the institutions know it. How\ndo you think that goes down?”\nThis was shorthand for a favorite Bannon riff: In the course of the campaign, Donald\nTrump had threatened virtually every institution in American political life. He was a\nclown-prince version of Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Trump believed,\noffering catnip to deep American ire and resentment, that one man could be bigger than\nthe system. This analysis presupposed that the institutions of political life were as\nresponsive as those in the commercial life that Trump was from—and that they yearned to\nmeet the market and find the Zeitgeist. But what if these institutions—the media, the\njudiciary, the intelligence community, the greater executive branch itself, and the “swamp”\nwith its law firms, consultants, influence peddlers, and leakers—were in no way eager to\nadapt? If, by their nature, they were determined to endure, then this accidental president\nwas up against it.\nKushner seemed unpersuaded. “I wouldn’t put it like that,” he said.\n“I think that’s the lesson of the first hundred days that some people around here have\nlearned,” said Bannon, ignoring Kushner. “It’s not going to get better. This is what it’s\nlike.”\n“I don’t know,” said Kushner.\n“Know it,” said Bannon.\n“I think Sessions is doing okay,” said Kushner. “Don’t you?”\n19\nMIKA WHO?\nT\nhe media had unlocked the value of Donald Trump, but few in the media had\nunlocked it more directly and personally than Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.\nTheir MSNBC breakfast show was an ongoing soap-opera-ish or possibly Oprahesque\ndrama about their relationship with Trump—how he had disappointed them, how far they\nhad come from their original regard for him, and how much and how pathetically he\nregularly embarrassed himself. The bond he once had with them, forged through mutual\ncelebrity and a shared proprietary sense of politics (Scarborough, the former congressman,\nseemed to feel that he ought reasonably to be president as much as Donald Trump felt he\nshould be), had distinguished the show during the campaign; now its public fraying\nbecame part of the daily news cycle. Scarborough and Brzezinski lectured him, channeled\nthe concerns of his friends and family, upbraided him, and openly worried about him—\nthat he was getting the wrong advice (Bannon) and, too, that his mental powers were\nslipping. They also staked a claim at representing the reasonable center-right alternative to\nthe president, and indeed were quite a good barometer of both the center-right’s efforts to\ndeal with him and its day-to-day difficulties of living with him.\nTrump, believing he had been used and abused by Scarborough and Brzezinski,\nclaimed he’d stopped watching the show. But Hope Hicks, every morning, quaking, had to\nrecount it for him.\nMorning Joe was a ground-zero study in the way the media had over-invested in\nTrump. He was the whale against which media emotions, self-regard, ego, joie de guerre,\ncareer advancement, and desire to be at the center of the story, too, all churned in nearly\necstatic obsession. In reverse regard, the media was the same whale, serving the same\nfunction, for Trump.\nTo this Trump added another tic, a lifelong sense that people were constantly taking\nunfair advantage of him. This perhaps came from his father’s cheapness and lack of\ngenerosity, or from his own overawareness of being a rich kid (and, no doubt, his\ninsecurities about this), or from a negotiator’s profound understanding that it is never winwin,\nthat where there is profit there is loss. Trump simply could not abide the knowledge\nthat somebody was getting a leg up at his expense. His was a zero-sum ecosystem. In the\nworld of Trump, anything that he deemed of value either accrued to him or had been\nrobbed from him.\nScarborough and Brzezinski had taken their relationship with Trump and amply\nmonetized it, while putting no percentage in his pocket—and in this instance, he judged\nhis commission should be slavishly favorable treatment. To say this drove him mad would\nbe an understatement. He dwelled and fixated on the perceived injustice. Don’t mention\nJoe or Mika to him was a standing proscription.\nHis wounded feelings and incomprehension at the failure of people whose embrace he\nsought to, in return, embrace him was “deep, crazy deep,” said his former aide Sam\nNunberg, who had run afoul of his need for 100 percent approbation and his bitter\nsuspicion of being profited from.\n* * *\nOut of this accumulated rage came his June 29 tweet about Mika Brzezinski.\nIt was classic Trump: there was no mediation between off-the-record language and the\npublic statement. Referring to “low I.Q. Crazy Mika” in one tweet, he wrote in another\nthat she was “bleeding badly from a facelift” when she and Scarborough visited Trump at\nMar-a-Lago on the previous New Year’s Eve. Many of his tweets were not, as they might\nseem, spontaneous utterances, but constant ones. Trump’s rifts often began as insult\ncomedy and solidified as bitter accusations and then, in an uncontainable moment, became\nan official proclamation.\nThe next step, in his tweet paradigm, was universal liberal opprobrium. Almost a week\nof social media fury, cable breast-beating, and front-page condemnation followed his\ntweet about Brzezinski. That was accompanied by the other part of the Trump tweet\ndynamic: by unifying liberal opinion against him, he unified its opposite for him.\nIn truth, he was often neither fully aware of the nature of what he had said nor fully\ncognizant of why there should be such a passionate reaction to it. As often as not, he\nsurprised himself. “What did I say?” he would ask after getting severe blowback.\nHe wasn’t serving up these insults for effect—well, not entirely. And his behavior\nwasn’t carefully calculated; it was tit for tat, and he likely would have said what he’d said\neven if no one was left standing with him. (This very lack of calculation, this inability to\nbe political, was part of his political charm.) It was just his good luck that the Trumpian 35\npercent—that standing percentage of people who, according to most polls, seemed to\nsupport him no matter what (who would, in his estimation, let him get away with shooting\nsomeone on Fifth Avenue)—was largely unfazed and maybe even buoyed by every new\nexpression of Trumpness.\nNow, having expressed himself and gotten in the last word, Trump was cheery again.\n“Mika and Joe totally love this. It’s big ratings for them,” said the president, with\ncertain satisfaction and obvious truth.\n* * *\nTen days later, a large table of Bannonites was having dinner at the Bombay Club, a highend\nIndian restaurant two blocks from the White House. One of the group—Arthur\nSchwartz, a PR consultant—asked a question about the Mika and Joe affair.\nPerhaps it was the noise, but it was also a fitting measure of the speed of events in the\nTrump era: Bannon lieutenant Alexandra Preate replied, with genuine fogginess, “Who?”\nThe operetta of the Mika tweets—the uncouthness and verbal abuse demonstrated by\nthe president, his serious lack of control and judgment, and the worldwide censure heaped\nupon him for it—had already far receded, wholly overshadowed by more Trump eruptions\nand controversy.\nBut before moving on to the next episode of ohmygodness, it is worth considering the\npossibility that this constant, daily, often more than once-a-day, pileup of events—each\none canceling out the one before—is the true aberration and novelty at the heart of the\nTrump presidency.\nPerhaps never before in history—not through world wars, the overthrow of empires,\nperiods of extraordinary social transformation, or episodes of government-shaking scandal\n—have real-life events unfolded with such emotional and plot-thickening impact. In the\nfashion of binge-watching a television show, one’s real life became quite secondary to the\npublic drama. It was not unreasonable to say Whoa, wait just a minute: public life doesn’t\nhappen like this. Public life in fact lacks coherence and drama. (History, by contrast,\nattains coherence and drama only in hindsight.)\nThe process of accomplishing the smallest set of tasks within the sprawling and\nresistant executive branch is a turtle process. The burden of the White House is the\nboredom of bureaucracy. All White Houses struggle to rise above that, and they succeed\nonly on occasion. In the age of hypermedia, this has not gotten easier for the White House,\nit’s gotten harder.\nIt’s a distracted nation, fragmented and preoccupied. It was, arguably, the peculiar\ntragedy of Barack Obama that even as a transformational figure—and inspirational\ncommunicator—he couldn’t really command much interest. As well, it might be a central\ntragedy of the news media that its old-fashioned and even benighted civic-minded belief\nthat politics is the highest form of news has helped transform it from a mass business to a\nnarrow-cast one. Alas, politics itself has more and more become a discrete business. Its\nappeal is B-to-B—business-to-business. The real swamp is the swamp of insular, inbred,\nincestuous interests. This isn’t corruption so much as overspecialization. It’s a wonk’s life.\nPolitics has gone one way, the culture another. The left-right junkies might pretend\notherwise, but the great middle doesn’t put political concerns at the top of their minds.\nAnd yet, contravening all cultural and media logic, Donald Trump produced on a daily\nbasis an astonishing, can’t-stop-following-it narrative. And this was not even because he\nwas changing or upsetting the fundamentals of American life. In six months as president,\nfailing to master almost any aspect of the bureaucratic process, he had, beyond placing his\nnominee on the Supreme Court, accomplished, practically speaking, nothing. And yet,\nOMG!!! There almost was no other story in America—and in much of the world. That was\nthe radical and transformational nature of the Trump presidency: it held everybody’s\nattention.\nInside the White House, the daily brouhaha and world’s fascination was no cause for\njoy. It was, in the White House staff’s bitter view, the media that turned every day into a\nclimactic, dastardly moment. And, in a sense, this was correct: every development cannot\nbe climactic. The fact that yesterday’s climax would soon, compared to the next climax, be\npiddling, rather bore out the disproportion. The media was failing to judge the relative\nimportance of Trump events: most Trump events came to naught (arguably all of them\ndid), and yet all were greeted with equal shock and horror. The White House staff believed\nthat the media’s Trump coverage lacked “context”—by this, they meant that people ought\nto realize that Trump was mostly just huffing and puffing.\nAt the same time, few in the White House did not assign blame to Trump for this as\nwell. He seemed to lack the most basic understanding that a president’s words and actions\nwould, necessarily, be magnified to the nth power. In some convenient sense, he failed to\nunderstand this because he wanted the attention, no matter how often it disappointed him.\nBut he also wanted it because again and again the response surprised him—and, as though\nevery time was the first time, he could not modify his behavior.\nSean Spicer caught the brunt of the daily drama, turning this otherwise reasonable,\nmild-mannered, process-oriented professional into a joke figure standing at the White\nHouse door. In his daily out-of-body experience, as a witness to his own humiliation and\nloss for words, Spicer understood after a while—although he began to understand this\nbeginning his first day on the job when dealing with the dispute about the inaugural\naudience numbers—that he had “gone down a rabbit hole.” In this disorienting place, all\npublic artifice, pretense, proportion, savvy, and self-awareness had been cast off, or—\npossibly another result of Trump never really intending to be president—never really\nfigured into the state of being president.\nOn the other hand, constant hysteria did have one unintended political virtue. If every\nnew event canceled out every other event, like some wacky news-cycle pyramid scheme,\nthen you always survived another day.\n* * *\nDonald Trump’s sons, Don Jr., thirty-nine, and Eric, thirty-three, existed in an enforced\ninfantile relationship to their father, a role that embarrassed them, but one that they also\nprofessionally embraced. The role was to be Donald Trump’s heirs and attendees. Their\nfather took some regular pleasure in pointing out that they were in the back of the room\nwhen God handed out brains—but, then again, Trump tended to scorn anyone who might\nbe smarter than he was. Their sister Ivanka, certainly no native genius, was the designated\nfamily smart person, her husband Jared the family’s smooth operator. That left Don and\nEric to errands and admin. In fact, the brothers had grown into reasonably competent\nfamily-owned-company executives (this is not saying all that much) because their father\nhad little or no patience for actually running his company. Of course, quite a good amount\nof their professional time was spent on the whims, projects, promotions, and general way\nof life of DJT.\nOne benefit of their father’s run for president was that it kept him away from the office.\nStill, the campaign’s administration was largely their responsibility, so when the campaign\nwent from caprice to a serious development in the Trump business and family, it caused a\ndisruption in the family dynamic. Other people were suddenly eager to be Donald Trump’s\nkey lieutenants. There were the outsiders, like Corey Lewandowski, the campaign\nmanager, but there was also the insider, brother-in-law Jared. Trump, not unusually for a\nfamily-run company, made everybody compete for his favor. The company was about\nhim; it existed because of his name, personality, and charisma, so the highest standing in\nthe company was reserved for those who could best serve him. There wasn’t all that much\ncompetition for this role before he ran for president, but in early 2016, with the\nRepublican Party collapsing and Trump rising, his sons faced a new professional and\nfamily situation.\nTheir brother-ln-law had been slowly drawn into the campaign, partly at his wife’s\nurging because her father’s lack of constraint might actually affect the Trump business if\nthey didn’t keep an eye on him. And then he, with his brothers-in-law, was pulled in by the\nexcitement of the campaign itself. By late spring 2016, when the nomination was all but\nclinched, the Trump campaign was a set of competing power centers with the knives out.\nLewandowski regarded both brothers and their brother-in-law with rolling-on-the-floor\ncontempt: not only were Don Jr. and Eric stupid, and Jared somehow both supercilious\nand obsequious (the butler), but nobody knew a whit about politics—indeed, there wasn’t\nan hour of political experience among them.\nAs time went on, Lewandowski became particularly close to the candidate. To the\nfamily, especially to Kushner, Lewandowski was an enabler. Trump’s worst instincts\nflowed through Lewandowski. In early June, a little more than a month before the\nRepublican National Convention, Jared and Ivanka decided that what was needed—for the\nsake of the campaign, for the sake of the Trump business—was an intervention.\nMaking common cause with Don Jr. and Eric, Jared and Ivanka pushed for a united\nfront to convince Trump to oust Lewandowski. Don Jr., feeling squeezed not only by\nLewandowski but by Jared, too, seized the opportunity. He would push out Lewandowski\nand become his replacement—and indeed, eleven days later Lewandowski would be gone.\nAll this was part of the background to one of the most preposterous meetings in\nmodern politics. On June 9, 2016, Don Jr., Jared, and Paul Manafort met with a\nmovieworthy cast of dubious characters in Trump Tower after having been promised\ndamaging information about Hillary Clinton. Don Jr., encouraged by Jared and Ivanka,\nwas trying to impress his father that he had the stuff to rise in the campaign.\nWhen this meeting became public thirteen months later, it would, for the Trump White\nHouse, encapsulate both the case against collusion with the Russians and the case for it. It\nwas a case, or the lack of one, not of masterminds and subterfuge, but of senseless and\nbenighted people so guileless and unconcerned that they enthusiastically colluded in plain\nsight.\n* * *\nWalking into Trump Tower that June day were a well-connected lawyer from Moscow,\nwho was a likely Russian agent; associates of the Azerbaijani Russian oligarch Aras\nAgalarov; a U.S. music promoter who managed Agalarov’s son, a Russian pop star; and a\nRussian government lobbyist in Washington. Their purpose in visiting the campaign\nheadquarters of a presumptive major party nominee for president of the United States was\nto meet with three of the most highly placed people on the campaign. This meeting was\npreceded by an email chain addressed to multiple recipients inside the Trump campaign of\nalmost joyful intent: the Russians were offering a dump of negative or even incriminating\ninformation about their opponent.\nAmong the why-and-how theories of this imbecilic meeting:\n• The Russians, in organized or freelance fashion, were trying to entrap the Trump\ncampaign into a compromising relationship.\n• The meeting was part of an already active cooperation on the part of the Trump\ncampaign with the Russians to obtain and distribute damaging information about\nHillary Clinton—and, indeed, within days of the Don Jr. meeting, WikiLeaks\nannounced that it had obtained Clinton emails. Less than a month later, it started to\nrelease them.\n• The wide-eyed Trump campaign, largely still playacting at running for president—\nand with no thought whatsoever of actually winning the election—was open to any\nand all entreaties and offers, because it had nothing to lose. Dopey Don Jr. (Fredo, as\nSteve Bannon would dub him, in one of his frequent Godfather borrowings) was\nsimply trying to prove he was a player and a go-to guy.\n• The meeting included the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and the campaign’s\nmost influential voice, Jared Kushner, because: (a) a high-level conspiracy was\nbeing coordinated; (b) Manafort and Kushner, not taking the campaign very\nseriously, and without a thought of any consequence here, were merely entertained\nby the possibility of dirty tricks; (c) the three men were united in their plan to get rid\nof Lewandowski—with Don Jr. as the hatchet man—and, as part of this unity,\nManafort and Kushner need to show up at Don Jr.’s silly meeting.\nWhatever the reason for the meeting, no matter which of the above scenarios most\naccurately describes how this comical and alarming group came together, a year later,\npractically nobody doubted that Don Jr. would have wanted his father to know that he\nseized the initiative.\n“The chance that Don Jr. did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the\ntwenty-sixth floor is zero,” said an astonished and derisive Bannon, not long after the\nmeeting was revealed.\n“The three senior guys in the campaign,” an incredulous Bannon went on, “thought it\nwas a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference\nroom on the twenty-fifth floor—with no lawyers. They didn’t have any lawyers. Even if\nyou thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think\nit’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately. Even if you didn’t think to do\nthat, and you’re totally amoral, and you wanted that information, you do it in a Holiday\nInn in Manchester, New Hampshire, with your lawyers who meet with these people and go\nthrough everything and then they verbally come and tell another lawyer in a cut-out, and if\nyou’ve got something, then you figure out how to dump it down to Breitbart or something\nlike that, or maybe some other more legitimate publication. You never see it, you never\nknow it, because you don’t need to… . But that’s the brain trust that they had.”\nAll of the participants would ultimately plead that the meeting was utterly\ninconsequential, whatever the hope for it might have been, and admit that it was hapless.\nBut even if that was true, a year later the revelation of the meeting had three profound and\nprobably transformational effects:\nFirst, the constant, ever repeated denials about there having been no discussion\nbetween campaign officials and the Russians connected to the Kremlin about the\ncampaign, and, indeed, no meaningful contact between campaign officials and the Russian\ngovernment, were exploded.\nSecond, the certainty among the White House staff that Trump himself would have not\nonly been apprised of the details of this meeting, but have met the principals, meant that\nthe president was caught out as a liar by those whose trust he most needed. It was another\ninflection point between hunkered-in-the-bunker and signed-on-for-the-wild-ride, and getme-out-of-here.\nThird, it was now starkly clear that everyone’s interests diverged. The fortunes of Don\nJr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner hung individually in the balance. Indeed, the best\nguess by many in the West Wing was that the details of the meeting had been leaked by\nthe Kushner side, thus sacrificing Don Jr. in an attempt to deflect responsibility away from\nthemselves.\n* * *\nEven before word of the June 2016 meeting leaked out, Kushner’s legal team—largely\nassembled in a rush since the appointment of Mueller, the special counsel—had been\npiecing together a forensic picture of both the campaign’s Russian contacts and Kushner\nCompanies’ finances and money trail. In January, ignoring almost everybody’s caution\nagainst it, Jared Kushner had entered the White House as a senior figure in the\nadministration; now, six months later, he faced acute legal jeopardy. He had tried to keep a\nlow profile, seeing himself as a behind-the-scenes counselor, but now his public position\nwas not only endangering himself but the future of his family’s business. As long as he\nremained exposed, his family was effectively blocked from most financial sources.\nWithout access to this market, their holdings risked becoming distress debt situations.\nJared and Ivanka’s self-created fantasylike life—two ambitious, well-mannered, wellliked\nyoung people living at the top of New York’s social and financial world after having,\nin their version of humble fashion, accepted global power—had now, even with neither\nhusband nor wife in office long enough to have taken any real action at all, come to the\nprecipice of disgrace.\nJail was possible. So was bankruptcy. Trump may have been talking defiantly about\noffering pardons, or bragging about his power to give them, but that did not solve\nKushner’s business problems, nor did it provide a way to mollify Charlie Kushner, Jared’s\ncholeric and often irrational father. What’s more, successfully navigating through the eye\nof the legal needle would require a careful touch and nuanced strategic approach on the\npart of the president—quite an unlikely development.\nMeanwhile, the couple blamed everyone else in the White House. They blamed Priebus\nfor the disarray that had produced a warlike atmosphere that propelled constant and\ndamaging leaks, they blamed Bannon for leaking, and they blamed Spicer for poorly\ndefending their virtue and interests.\nThey needed to defend themselves. One strategy was to get out of town (Bannon had a\nlist of all the tense moments when the couple had taken a convenient holiday), and it\nhappened that Trump would be attending the G20 summit Hamburg, Germany, on July 7\nand 8. Jared and Ivanka accompanied the president on the trip, and while at the summit\nthey learned that word of Don Jr.’s meeting with the Russians—and the couple kept\npointedly presenting it as Don Jr.’s meeting—had leaked. Worse, they learned that the\nstory was about to break in the New York Times.\nOriginally, Trump’s staff was expecting details of the Don Jr. meeting to break on the\nwebsite Circa. The lawyers, and spokesperson Mark Corallo, had been working to manage\nthis news. But while in Hamburg, the president’s staff learned that the Times was\ndeveloping a story that had far more details about the meeting—quite possibly supplied by\nthe Kushner side—which it would publish on Saturday, July 8. Advance knowledge of this\narticle was kept from the president’s legal team for the ostensible reason that it didn’t\ninvolve the president.\nIn Hamburg, Ivanka, knowing the news would shortly get out, was presenting her\nsignature effort: a World Bank fund to aid women entrepreneurs in developing countries.\nThis was another instance of what White House staffers saw as the couple’s\nextraordinarily off-message direction. Nowhere in the Trump campaign, nowhere on\nBannon’s white boards, nowhere in the heart of this president was there an interest in\nwomen entrepreneurs in developing countries. The daughter’s agenda was singularly at\nodds with the father’s—or at least the agenda that had elected him. Ivanka, in the view of\nalmost every White House staffer, profoundly misunderstood the nature of her job and had\nconverted traditional First Lady noblesse oblige efforts into White House staff work.\nShortly before boarding Air Force One for the return trip home, Ivanka—with what by\nnow was starting to seem like an almost anarchic tone deafness—sat in for her father\nbetween Chinese president Xi Jinping and British prime minister Theresa May at the main\nG20 conference table. But this was mere distraction: as the president and his team huddled\non the plane, the central subject was not the conference, it was how to respond to the\nTimes story about Don Jr.’s and Jared’s Trump Tower meeting, now only hours away from\nbreaking.\nEn route to Washington, Sean Spicer and everybody else from the communications\noffice was relegated to the back of the plane and excluded from the panicky discussions.\nHope Hicks became the senior communications strategist, with the president, as always,\nher singular client. In the days following, that highest political state of being “in the room”\nwas turned on its head. Not being in the room—in this case, the forward cabin on Air\nForce One—became an exalted status and get-out-of-jail-free card. “It used to hurt my\nfeelings when I saw them running around doing things that were my job,” said Spicer.\n“Now I’m glad to be out of the loop.”\nIncluded in the discussion on the plane were the president, Hicks, Jared and Ivanka,\nand their spokesperson, Josh Raffel. Ivanka, according to the later recollection of her\nteam, would shortly leave the meeting, take a pill, and go to sleep. Jared, in the telling of\nhis team, might have been there, but he was “not taking a pencil to anything.” Nearby, in a\nsmall conference room watching the movie Fargo, were Dina Powell, Gary Cohn, Stephen\nMiller, and H. R. McMaster, all of whom would later insist that they were, however\nphysically close to the unfolding crisis, removed from it. And, indeed, anyone “in the\nroom” was caught in a moment that would shortly receive the special counsel’s close\nscrutiny, with the relevant question being whether one or more federal employees had\ninduced other federal employees to lie.\nAn aggrieved, unyielding, and threatening president dominated the discussion, pushing\ninto line his daughter and her husband, Hicks, and Raffel. Kasowitz—the lawyer whose\nspecific job was to keep Trump at arm’s length from Russian-related matters—was kept\non hold on the phone for an hour and then not put through. The president insisted that the\nmeeting in Trump Tower was purely and simply about Russian adoption policy. That’s\nwhat was discussed, period. Period. Even though it was likely, if not certain, that the Times\nhad the incriminating email chain—in fact, it was quite possible that Jared and Ivanka and\nthe lawyers knew the Times had this email chain—the president ordered that no one should\nlet on to the more problematic discussion about Hillary Clinton.\nIt was a real-time example of denial and cover-up. The president believed,\nbelligerently, what he believed. Reality was what he was convinced it was—or should be.\nHence the official story: there was a brief courtesy meeting in Trump Tower about\nadoption policy, to no result, attended by senior aides and unaffiliated Russian nationals.\nThe crafting of this manufactured tale was a rogue operation by rookies—always the two\nmost combustible elements of a cover-up.\nIn Washington, Kasowitz and the legal team’s spokesperson, Mark Corallo, weren’t\ninformed of either the Times article or the plan for how to respond to it until Don Jr.’s\ninitial statement went out just before the story broke that Saturday.\nOver the course of next seventy-two hours or so, the senior staff found itself wholly\nseparate from—and, once again, looking on in astonishment at—the actions of the\npresident’s innermost circle of aides. In this, the relationship of the president and Hope\nHicks, long tolerated as a quaint bond between the older man and a trustworthy young\nwoman, began to be seen as anomalous and alarming. Completely devoted to\naccommodating him, she, his media facilitator, was the ultimate facilitator of unmediated\nbehavior. His impulses and thoughts—unedited, unreviewed, unchallenged—not only\npassed through him, but, via Hicks, traveled out into the world without any other White\nHouse arbitration.\n“The problem isn’t Twitter, it’s Hope,” observed one communication staffer.\nOn July 9, a day after publishing its first story, the Times noted that the Trump Tower\nmeeting was specifically called to discuss the Russian offer of damaging material about\nClinton. The next day, as the Times prepared to publish the full email chain, Don Jr.\nhurriedly dumped it himself. There followed an almost daily count of new figures—all, in\ntheir own way, peculiar and unsettling—who emerged as participants in the meeting.\nBut the revelation of the Trump Tower meeting had another, perhaps even larger\ndimension. It marked the collapse of the president’s legal strategy: the demise of Steve\nBannon’s Clinton-emulating firewall around the president.\nThe lawyers, in disgust and alarm, saw, in effect, each principal becoming a witness to\nanother principal’s potential misdeeds—all conspiring with one another to get their stories\nstraight. The client and his family were panicking and running their own defense. Short-\nterm headlines were overwhelming any sort of long-term strategy. “The worst thing you\ncan do is lie to a prosecutor,” said one member of the legal team. The persistent Trump\nidea that it is not a crime to lie to the media was regarded by the legal team as at best\nreckless and, in itself, potentially actionable: an explicit attempt to throw sand into the\ninvestigation’s gears.\nMark Corallo was instructed not to speak to the press, indeed not to even answer his\nphone. Later that week, Corallo, seeing no good outcome—and privately confiding that he\nbelieved the meeting on Air Force One represented a likely obstruction of justice—quit.\n(The Jarvanka side would put it out that Corallo was fired.)\n“These guys are not going to be second-guessed by the kids,” said a frustrated Bannon\nabout the firewall team.\nLikewise, the Trump family, no matter its legal exposure, was not going to be run by its\nlawyers. Jared and Ivanka helped to coordinate a set of lurid leaks—alleging drinking, bad\nbehavior, personal life in disarray—about Marc Kasowitz, who had advised the president\nto send the couple home. Shortly after the presidential party returned to Washington,\nKasowitz was out.\n* * *\nBlame continued to flow. The odor of a bitter new reality, if not doom, that attached to the\nComey-Mueller debacle was compounded by everyone’s efforts not to be tagged by it.\nThe sides in the White House—Jared, Ivanka, Hope Hicks, and an increasingly\nambivalent Dina Powell and Gary Cohn on one side, and almost everyone else, including\nPriebus, Spicer, Conway, and most clearly Bannon, on the other—were most distinguished\nby their culpability in or distance from the Comey-Mueller calamity. It was, as the non-\nJarvanka side would unceasingly point out, a calamity of their own making. Therefore it\nbecame an effort of the Jarvankas not only to achieve distance for themselves from the\ncauses of the debacle—such involvement as they had they now cast as strictly passive\ninvolvement or just following orders—but to suggest that their adversaries were at least\nequally at fault.\nShortly after the Don Jr. story broke, the president not unsuccessfully changed the\nsubject by focusing the blame for the Comey-Mueller mess on Sessions, even more\nforcefully belittling and threatening him and suggesting that his days were numbered.\nBannon, who continued to defend Sessions, and who believed that he had militantly—\nindeed with scathing attacks on the Jarvankas for their stupidity—walled himself off from\nthe Comey smashup, was now suddenly getting calls from reporters with leaks that\npainted him as an engaged participant in the Comey decision.\nIn a furious phone call to Hicks, Bannon blamed the leaks on her. In time, he had come\nto see the twenty-eight-year-old as nothing more than a hapless presidential enabler and\npoor-fish Jarvanka flunky—and he believed she had now deeply implicated herself in the\nentire disaster by participating in the Air Force One meeting. The next day, with more\ninquiries coming from reporters, he confronted Hicks inside the cabinet room, accusing\nher of doing Jared and Ivanka’s dirty work. The face-off quickly escalated into an\nexistential confrontation between the two sides of the White House—two sides on a total\nwar footing.\n“You don’t know what you’re doing,” shouted a livid Bannon at Hicks, demanding to\nknow who she worked for, the White House or Jared and Ivanka. “You don’t know how\nmuch trouble you are in,” he screamed, telling her that if she didn’t get a lawyer he would\ncall her father and tell him he had better get her one. “You are dumb as a stone!” Moving\nfrom the cabinet room across the open area into the president’s earshot, “a loud, scary,\nclearly threatening” Bannon, in the Jarvanka telling, yelled, “I am going to fuck you and\nyour little group!” with a baffled president plaintively wanting to know, “What’s going\non?”\nIn the Jarvanka-side account, Hicks then ran from Bannon, hysterically sobbing and\n“visibly terrified.” Others in the West Wing marked this as the high point of the boiling\nenmity between the two sides. For the Jarvankas, Bannon’s rant was also a display that\nthey believed they could use against him. The Jarvanka people pushed Priebus to refer the\nmatter to the White House counsel, billing this as the most verbally abusive moment in the\nhistory of the West Wing, or at least certainly up among the most abusive episodes ever.\nFor Bannon, this was just more Jarvanka desperation—they were the ones, not him,\nsaddled with Comey-Mueller. They were the ones panicking and out of control.\nFor the rest of his time in the White House, Bannon would not speak to Hicks again.\n20\nMCMASTER AND SCARAMUCCI\nT\nrump was impetuous and yet did not like to make decisions, at least not ones that\nseemed to corner him into having to analyze a problem. And no decision hounded\nhim so much—really from the first moment of his presidency—as what to do about\nAfghanistan. It was a conundrum that became a battle. It involved not only his own\nresistance to analytic reasoning, but the left brain/right brain divide of his White House,\nthe split between those who argued for disruption and those who wanted to uphold the\nstatus quo.\nIn this, Bannon became the disruptive and unlikely White House voice for peace—or\nanyway a kind of peace. In Bannon’s view, only he and the not-too-resolute backbone of\nDonald Trump stood between consigning fifty thousand more American soldiers to\nhopelessness in Afghanistan.\nRepresenting the status quo—and, ideally, a surge on top of the status quo—was H. R.\nMcMaster, who, next to Jarvanka, had become Bannon’s prime target for abuse. On this\nfront, Bannon forged an easy bond with the president, who didn’t much hide his contempt\nfor the Power-Point general. Bannon and the president enjoyed trash-talking McMaster\ntogether.\nMcMaster was a protégé of David Petraeus, the former CENTCOM and Afghanistan\ncommander who became Obama’s CIA director before resigning in a scandal involving a\nlove affair and the mishandling of classified information. Petraeus and now McMaster\nrepresented a kind of business-as-usual approach in Afghanistan and the Middle East. A\nstubborn McMaster kept proposing to the president new versions of the surge, but at each\npitch Trump would wave him out of the Oval Office and roll his eyes in despair and\ndisbelief.\nThe president’s distaste and rancor for McMaster grew on pace with the approaching\nneed to finally make a decision on Afghanistan, a decision he continued to put off. His\nposition on Afghanistan—a military quagmire he knew little about, other than that it was a\nquagmire—had always been a derisive and caustic kiss-off of the sixteen-year war. Having\ninherited it did not make his feelings warmer or inspire him to want to dwell on it further.\nHe knew the war was cursed and, knowing that, felt no need to know more. He put the\nresponsibility for it on two of his favorite people to blame: Bush and Obama.\nFor Bannon, Afghanistan represented one more failure of establishment thinking. More\nprecisely, it represented the establishment’s inability to confront failure.\nCuriously, McMaster had written a book on exactly this subject, a scathing critique of\nthe unchallenged assumptions with which military leaders pursued the Vietnam War. The\nbook was embraced by liberals and the establishment, with whom, in Bannon’s view,\nMcMaster had become hopelessly aligned. And now—ever afraid of the unknown, intent\non keeping options open, dedicated to stability, and eager to protect his establishment cred\n—McMaster was recommending a huge troop surge in Afghanistan.\n* * *\nBy early July, the pressure to make a decision was approaching the boiling point. Trump\nhad already authorized the Pentagon to deploy the troop resources it believed were\nneeded, but Defense Secretary Mattis refused to act without a specific authorization from\nthe president. Trump would finally have to make the call—unless he could find a way to\nput it off again.\nBannon’s thought was that the decision could be made for the president—a way the\npresident liked to have decisions made—if Bannon could get rid of McMaster. That would\nboth head off the strongest voice for more troops and also avenge Bannon’s ouster by\nMcMaster’s hand from the NSC.\nWith the president promising that he would make up his mind by August, and\nMcMaster, Mattis, and Tillerson pressing for a decision as soon as possible, Bannoninspired\nmedia began a campaign to brand McMaster as a globalist, interventionist, and all\naround not-our-kind-of-Trumper—and, to boot, soft on Israel.\nIt was a scurrilous, albeit partly true, attack. McMaster was in fact talking to Petraeus\noften. The kicker was the suggestion that McMaster was giving inside dope to Petraeus, a\npariah because of his guilty plea regarding his mishandling of classified information. It\nwas also the case that McMaster was disliked by the president and on the point of being\ndismissed.\nIt was Bannon, riding high again, enjoying himself in a moment of supreme\noverconfidence.\nIndeed, in part to prove there were other options beyond more troops or humiliating\ndefeat—and logically there probably weren’t more options—Bannon became a sponsor of\nBlackwater-founder Erik Prince’s obviously self-serving idea to replace the U.S. military\nforce with private contractors and CIA and Special Operations personnel. The notion was\nbriefly embraced by the president, then ridiculed by the military.\nBy now Bannon believed McMaster would be out by August. He was sure he had the\npresident’s word on this. Done deal. “McMaster wants to send more troops to\nAfghanistan, so we’re going to send him,” said a triumphal Bannon. In Bannon’s scenario,\nTrump would give McMaster a fourth star and “promote” him to top military commander\nin Afghanistan.\nAs with the chemical attack in Syria, it was Dina Powell—even as she made\nincreasingly determined efforts to get herself out of the White House, either on a Sheryl\nSandberg trajectory or, stopping first at a way station, as ambassador to the United Nations\n—who struggled to help support the least disruptive, most keep-all-options-open\napproach. In this, both because the approach seemed like the safest course and because it\nwas the opposite of Bannon’s course, she readily recruited Jared and Ivanka.\nThe solution Powell endorsed, which was designed to put the problem and the\nreckoning off for another year or two or three, was likely to make the United States’\nposition in Afghanistan even more hopeless. Instead of sending fifty or sixty thousand\ntroops—which, at insupportable cost and the risk of national fury, might in fact win the\nwar—the Pentagon would send some much lower number, one which would arouse little\nnotice and merely prevent us from losing the war. In the Powell and Jarvanka view, it was\nthe moderate, best-case, easiest-to-sell course, and it struck just the right balance between\nthe military’s unacceptable scenarios: retreat and dishonor or many more troops.\nBefore long, a plan to send four, five, six, or (tops) seven thousand troops became the\nmiddle-course strategy supported by the national security establishment and most\neveryone else save for Bannon and the president. Powell even helped design a PowerPoint\ndeck that McMaster began using with the president: pictures of Kabul in the 1970s when it\nstill looked something like a modern city. It could be like this again, the president was\ntold, if we are resolute!\nBut even with almost everyone arrayed against him, Bannon was confident he was\nwinning. He had a united right-wing press with him, and, he believed, a fed-up, workingclass\nTrump base—its children the likely Afghanistan fodder. Most of all, he had the\npresident. Pissed off that he was being handed the same problem and the same options that\nwere handed Obama, Trump continued to heap spleen and mockery on McMaster.\nKushner and Powell organized a leak campaign in McMaster’s defense. Their narrative\nwas not a pro-troops defense; instead, it was about Bannon’s leaks and his use of rightwing\nmedia to besmirch McMaster, “one of the most decorated and respected generals of\nhis generation.” The issue was not Afghanistan, the issue was Bannon. In this narrative, it\nwas McMaster, a figure of stability, against Bannon, a figure of disruption. It was the New\nYork Times and the Washington Post, who came to the defense of McMaster, against\nBreitbart and its cronies and satellites.\nIt was the establishment and never-Trumpers against the America-first Trumpkins. In\nmany respects, Bannon was outgunned and outnumbered, yet he still thought he had it\nnailed. And when he won, not only would another grievously stupid chapter in the war in\nAfghanistan be avoided, but Jarvanka, and Powell, their factotum, would be further\nconsigned to irrelevance and powerlessness.\n* * *\nAs the debate moved toward resolution, the NSC, in its role as a presenter of options\nrather than an advocate for them (although of course it was advocating, too), presented\nthree: withdrawal; Erik Prince’s army of contractors; and a conventional, albeit limited,\nsurge.\nWithdrawal, whatever its merits—and however much a takeover of Afghanistan by the\nTaliban could be delayed or mitigated—still left Donald Trump with having lost a war, an\ninsupportable position for the president.\nThe second option, a force of contractors and the CIA, was largely deep-sixed by the\nCIA. The agency had spent sixteen years successfully avoiding Afghanistan, and everyone\nknew that careers were not advanced in Afghanistan, they died in Afghanistan. So please\nkeep us out of it.\nThat left McMaster’s position, a modest surge, argued by Secretary of State Tillerson:\nmore troops in Afghanistan, which, somehow, slightly, would be there on a different basis,\nsomewhat, with a different mission, subtly, than that of troops sent there before.\nThe military fully expected the president to sign off on the third option. But on July 19,\nat a meeting of the national security team in the situation room at the White House, Trump\nlost it.\nFor two hours, he angrily railed against the mess he had been handed. He threatened to\nfire almost every general in the chain of command. He couldn’t fathom, he said, how it\nhad taken so many months of study to come up with this nothing-much-different plan. He\ndisparaged the advice that came from generals and praised the advice from enlisted men.\nIf we have to be in Afghanistan, he demanded, why can’t we make money off it? China,\nhe complained, has mining rights, but not the United States. (He was referring to a tenyear-old\nU.S.-backed deal.) This is just like the 21 Club, he said, suddenly confusing\neveryone with this reference to a New York restaurant, one of his favorites. In the 1980s,\n21 closed for a year and hired a large number of consultants to analyze how to make the\nrestaurant more profitable. In the end, their advice was: Get a bigger kitchen. Exactly what\nany waiter would have said, Trump shouted.\nTo Bannon, the meeting was a high point of the Trump presidency to date. The\ngenerals were punting and waffling and desperately trying to save face—they were,\naccording to Bannon, talking pure “gobbledygook” in the situation room. “Trump was\nstanding up to them,” said a happy Bannon. “Hammering them. He left a bowel movement\nin the middle of their Afghan plans. Again and again, he came back to the same point:\nwe’re stuck and losing and nobody here has a plan to do much better than that.”\nThough there was still no hint of a viable alternative strategy in Afghanistan, Bannon,\nhis Jarvanka frustration cresting, was sure he was the winner here. McMaster was toast.\n* * *\nLater on the day of the Afghanistan briefing, Bannon heard about yet another harebrained\nJarvanka scheme. They planned to hire Anthony Scaramucci, aka “the Mooch.”\nAfter Trump had clinched the nomination more than a year before, Scaramucci—a\nhedge funder and go-to Trump surrogate for cable business news (mostly Fox Business\nChannel)—had become a reliable presence at Trump Tower. But then, in the last month of\nthe campaign, with polls predicting a humiliating Trump defeat, he was suddenly nowhere\nto be seen. The question “Where’s the Mooch?” seemed to be just one more indicator of\nthe campaign’s certain and pitiless end.\nBut on the day after the election, Steve Bannon—soon to be named chief strategist for\nthe forty-fifth president-elect—was greeted as he arrived midmorning in Trump Tower by\nAnthony Scaramucci, holding a Starbucks coffee for him.\nOver the next three months, Scaramucci, although no longer needed as a surrogate and\nwithout anything else particularly to do, became a constant hovering—or even lurking—\npresence at Trump Tower. Ever unflagging, he interrupted a meeting in Kellyanne\nConway’s office in early January just to make sure she knew that her husband’s firm,\nWachtell, Lipton, was representing him. Having made that point, name-dropping and\nvastly praising the firm’s key partners, he then helped himself to a chair in Conway’s\nmeeting and, for both Conway’s and her visitor’s benefit, offered a stirring testimonial to\nthe uniqueness and sagacity of Donald Trump and the working-class people—speaking of\nwhich, he took the opportunity to provide a résumé of his own Long Island working-class\nbona fides—who had elected him.\nScaramucci was hardly the only hanger-on and job seeker in the building, but his\nmethod was among the most dogged. He spent his days looking for meetings to be invited\ninto, or visitors to engage with—this was easy because every other job seeker was looking\nfor someone with whom to chat it up, so he soon became something like the unofficial\nofficial greeter. Whenever possible, he would grab a few minutes with any senior staffer\nwho would not rebuff him. As he waited to be offered a high White House position, he\nwas, he seemed personally certain, reaffirming his loyalty and team spirit and unique\nenergy. He was so confident about his future that he made a deal to sell his hedge fund,\nSkybridge Capital, to HNA Group, the Chinese megaconglomerate.\nPolitical campaigns, substantially based on volunteer help, attract a range of silly,\nneedy, and opportunistic figures. The Trump campaign perhaps scraped lower in the barrel\nthan most. The Mooch, for one, might not have been the most peculiar volunteer in the\nTrump run for president, but many figured him to be among the most shameless.\nIt was not just that before he became a dedicated supporter of Donald Trump, he was a\ndedicated naysayer, or that he had once been an Obama and Hillary Clinton supporter. The\nproblem was that, really, nobody liked him. Even for someone in politics, he was\nimmodest and incorrigible, and followed by a trail of self-serving and often contradictory\nstatements made to this person about that person, which invariably made it back to\nwhatever person was being most negatively talked about.\nHe was not merely a shameless self-promoter; he was a proud self-promoter. He was,\nby his own account, a fantastic networker. (This boast was surely true, since Skybridge\nCapital was a fund of funds, which is less a matter of investment acumen than of knowing\ntop fund managers and being able to invest with them.) He had paid as much as half a\nmillion dollars to have his firm’s logo appear in the movie Wall Street 2 and to buy himself\na cameo part in the film. He ran a yearly conference for hedge funders at which he himself\nwas the star. He had a television gig at Fox Business Channel. He was a famous partier\nevery year at Davos, once exuberantly dancing alongside the son of Muammar Gaddafi.\nAs for the presidential campaign, when signing on with Donald Trump—after he had\nbet big against Trump—he billed himself as a version of Trump, and he saw the two of\nthem as a new kind of showman and communicator set to transform politics.\nAlthough his persistence and his constant on-the-spot personal lobbying might not\nhave endeared him to anybody, it did prompt the “What to do with Scaramucci?” question,\nwhich somehow came to beg an answer. Priebus, trying to deal with the Mooch problem\nand dispose of him at the same time, suggested that he take a money-raising job as finance\ndirector of the RNC—an offer Scaramucci rebuffed in a blowup in Trump Tower, loudly\nbad-mouthing Priebus in vivid language, a mere preview of what was to come.\nWhile he wanted a job with the Trump administration, the Mooch specifically wanted\none of the jobs that would give him a tax break on the sale of his business. A federal\nprogram provides for deferred payment of capital gains in the event of a sale of property\nto meet ethical requirements. Scaramucci needed a job that would get him a “certificate of\ndivestiture,” which is what an envious Scaramucci knew Gary Cohn had received for the\nsale of his Goldman stock.\nA week before the inaugural he was finally offered such a job: director of the White\nHouse Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs. He would be the\npresident’s representative and cheerleader before Trump-partial interest groups.\nBut the White House ethics office balked—the sale of his business would take months\nto complete and he would be directly negotiating with an entity that was at least in part\ncontrolled by the Chinese government. And because Scaramucci had little support from\nanybody else, he was effectively blocked. It was, a resentful Scaramucci noted, one of the\nfew instances in the Trump government when someone’s business conflicts interfered with\na White House appointment.\nAnd yet with a salesman’s tenacity, the Mooch pressed on. He appointed himself a\nTrump ambassador without portfolio. He declared himself Trump’s man on Wall Street,\neven if, practically speaking, he wasn’t a Trump man and he was exiting his firm on Wall\nStreet. He was also in constant touch with anybody from the Trump circle who was\nwilling to be in touch with him.\nThe “What to do with the Mooch” question persisted. Kushner, with whom Scaramucci\nhad exercised a rare restraint during the campaign, and who had steadily heard from other\nNew York contacts about Scaramucci’s continued loyalty, helped push the question.\nPriebus and others held Scaramucci at bay until June and then, as a bit of a punch line,\nScaramucci was offered and, degradingly, had to accept, being named senior vice\npresident and chief strategy officer for the U.S. Export-Import Bank, an executive branch\nagency Trump had long vowed to eliminate. But the Mooch was not ready to give up the\nfight: after yet more lobbying, he was offered, at Bannon’s instigation, the post of\nambassador to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The job\ncame with a twenty-room apartment on the Seine, a full staff, and—Bannon found this\npart particularly amusing—absolutely no influence or responsibilities.\n* * *\nMeanwhile, another persistent question, “What to do with Spicer,” seemed to somehow\nhave been joined to the disaster involving the bungled response to the news of the June\n2016 meeting between Don Jr., Jared, and the Russians. Since the president, while\ntraveling on Air Force One, had actually dictated Don Jr.’s response to the initial Times\nreport about the meeting, the blame for this should have been laid at the feet of Trump and\nHope Hicks: Trump dictated, Hicks transcribed. But because no disasters could be laid at\nthe president’s feet, Hicks herself was spared. And, even though he had been pointedly\nexcluded from the Trump Tower crisis, the blame for the episode was now put at Spicer’s\nfeet, precisely because, his loyalty in doubt, he and the communications staff had to be\nexcluded.\nIn this, the comms team was judged to be antagonistic if not hostile to the interests of\nJared and Ivanka; Spicer and his people had failed to mount an inclusive defense for them,\nnor had the comms team adequately defended the White House. This of course homed in\non the essential and obvious point: although the junior first couple were mere staffers and\nnot part of the institutional standing of the White House, they thought and acted as if they\nwere part of the presidential entity. Their ire and increasing bitterness came from some of\nthe staff’s reluctance—really, a deep and intensifying resistance—to treat them as part and\nparcel of the presidency. (Once Priebus had to take Ivanka aside to make sure she\nunderstood that in her official role, she was just a staffer. Ivanka had insisted on the\ndistinction that she was a staffer-slash-First Daughter.)\nBannon was their public enemy; they expected nothing of him. But Priebus and Spicer\nthey regarded as functionaries, and their job was to support the White House’s goals,\nwhich included their goals and interests.\nSpicer, ever ridiculed in the media for his cockamamie defense of the White House and\na seeming dumb loyalty, had been judged by the president, quite from the inauguration, to\nbe not loyal enough and not nearly as aggressive as he should be in Trump’s defense. Or,\nin Jared and Ivanka’s view, in his family’s defense. “What does Spicer’s forty-member\ncomm staff actually do?” was a persistent First Family question.\n* * *\nAlmost from the beginning, the president had been interviewing potential new press\nsecretaries. He appeared to have offered the job to various people, one of whom was\nKimberly Guilfoyle, the Fox News personality and cohost of The Five. Guilfoyle, the\nformer wife of California Democrat Gavin Newsom, was also reported to be Anthony\nScaramucci’s girlfriend, a rumor he denied. Unbeknownst to the White House,\nScaramucci’s personal life was in dramatic free fall. On July 9, nine months pregnant with\ntheir second child, Scaramucci’s wife filed for divorce.\nGuilfoyle, knowing that Spicer was on his way out but having decided not to take his\njob—or, according to others in the White House, never having been offered it—suggested\nScaramucci, who set to work convincing Jared and Ivanka that theirs was largely a PR\nproblem and that they were ill served by the current communications team.\nScaramucci called a reporter he knew to urge that an upcoming story about Kushner’s\nRussian contacts be spiked. He followed up by having another mutual contact call the\nreporter to say that if the story was spiked it would help the Mooch get into the White\nHouse, whereupon the reporter would have special Mooch access. The Mooch then\nassured Jared and Ivanka that he had, in this clever way, killed the story.\nNow Scaramucci had their attention. We need some new thinking, the couple thought;\nwe need somebody who is more on our side. The fact that Scaramucci was from New\nYork, and Wall Street, and was rich, reassured them that he understood what the deal was.\nAnd that he would understand the stakes and know that an aggressive game needed to be\nplayed.\nOn the other hand, the couple did not want to be perceived as being heavy-handed. So,\nafter bitterly accusing Spicer of not defending them adequately, they suddenly backed off\nand suggested that they were just looking to add a new voice to the mix. The job of White\nHouse communications director, which had no precise purview, had been vacant since\nMay, when Mike Dubke, whose presence at the White House had hardly registered,\nresigned. Scaramucci could take this job, the couple figured, and in that role he could be\ntheir ally.\n“He’s good on television,” Ivanka told Spicer when she explained the rationale for\nhiring a former hedge fund manager as White House communications director. “Maybe he\ncan help us.”\nIt was the president who, meeting with Scaramucci, was won over by the Mooch’s\ncringeworthy Wall Street hortatory flattery. (“I can only hope to realize a small part of\nyour genius as a communicator, but you are my example and model” was one report of the\ngist of the Scaramucci supplication.) And it was Trump who then urged that Scaramucci\nbecome the true communications chief, reporting directly to the president.\nOn July 19, Jared and Ivanka, through intermediaries, put a feeler out to Bannon: What\nwould he think about Scaramucci’s coming on board in the comms job?\nSo preposterous did this seem to Bannon—it was a cry of haplessness, and certain\nevidence that the couple had become truly desperate—that he refused to consider or even\nreply to the question. Now he was sure: Jarvanka was losing it.\n21\nBANNON AND SCARAMUCCI\nB\nannon’s apartment in Arlington, Virginia, a fifteen-minute drive from downtown\nWashington, was called the “safe house.” This seemed somehow to acknowledge his\ntransience and to nod, with whatever irony, to the underground and even romantic nature\nof his politics—the roguish and joie de guerre alt-right. Bannon had decamped here from\nthe Breitbart Embassy on A Street on Capitol Hill. It was a one-bedroom graduate-student\nsort of apartment, in a mixed-use building over a mega-McDonald’s—quite belying\nBannon’s rumored fortune—with five or six hundred books (emphasis on popular history)\nstacked against the wall without benefit of shelving. His lieutenant, Alexandra Preate, also\nlived in the building, as did the American lawyer for Nigel Farage, the right-wing British\nBrexit leader who was part of the greater Breitbart circle.\nOn the evening on Thursday, July 20, the day after the contentious meeting about\nAfghanistan, Bannon was hosting a small dinner—organized by Preate, with Chinese\ntakeout. Bannon was in an expansive, almost celebratory, mood. Still, Bannon knew, just\nwhen you felt on top of the world in the Trump administration, you could probably count\non getting cut down. That was the pattern and price of one-man leadership—insecure-man\nleadership. The other biggest guy in the room always had to be reduced in size.\nMany around him felt Bannon was going into another bad cycle. In his first run around\nthe track, he’d been punished by the president for his Time magazine cover and for the\nSaturday Night Live portrayal of “President Bannon”—that cruelest of digs to Trump.\nNow there was a new book, The Devil’s Bargain, and it claimed, often in Bannon’s own\nwords, that Trump could not have done it without him. The president was again greatly\npeeved.\nStill, Bannon seemed to feel he had broken through. Whatever happened, he had\nclarity. It was such a mess inside in the White House that, if nothing else, this clarity\nwould put him on top. His agenda was front and center, and his enemies sidelined. Jared\nand Ivanka were getting blown up every day and were now wholly preoccupied with\nprotecting themselves. Dina Powell was looking for another job. McMaster had screwed\nhimself on Afghanistan. Gary Cohn, once a killer enemy, was now desperate to be named\nFed chairman and currying favor with Bannon—“licking my balls,” Bannon said with a\nquite a cackle. In return for supporting Cohn’s campaign to win the Fed job, Bannon was\nextracting fealty from him for the right-wing trade agenda.\nThe geniuses were fucked. Even POTUS might be fucked. But Bannon had the vision\nand the discipline—he was sure he did. “I’m cracking my shit every day. The nationalist\nagenda, we’re fucking owning it. I’ll be there for the duration.”\nBefore the dinner, Bannon had sent around an article from the Guardian—though one\nof the leading English-language left-leaning newspapers, it was nevertheless Bannon’s\nfavorite paper—about the backlash to globalization. The article, by the liberal journalist\nNikil Saval, both accepted Bannon’s central populist political premise—“the competition\nbetween workers in developing and developed countries … helped drive down wages and\njob security for workers in developed countries”—and elevated it to the epochal fight of\nour time. Davos was dead and Bannon was very much alive. “Economists who were once\nardent proponents of globalization have become some of its most prominent critics,” wrote\nSaval. “Erstwhile supporters now concede, at least in part, that it has produced inequality,\nunemployment and downward pressure on wages. Nuances and criticisms that economists\nonly used to raise in private seminars are finally coming out in the open.”\n“I’m starting to get tired of winning” was all that Bannon said in his email with the link\nto the article.\nNow, restless and pacing, Bannon was recounting how Trump had dumped on\nMcMaster and, as well, savoring the rolling-on-the-floor absurdity of the geniuses’\nScaramucci gambit. But most of all he was incredulous about something else that had\nhappened the day before.\nUnbeknownst to senior staff, or to the comms office—other than by way of a pro forma\nschedule note—the president had given a major interview to the New York Times. Jared\nand Ivanka, along with Hope Hicks, had set it up. The Times’s Maggie Haberman,\nTrump’s bête noire (“very mean, and not smart”) and yet his go-to journalist for some\nhigher sort of approval, had been called in to see the president with her colleagues Peter\nBaker and Michael Schmidt. The result was one of the most peculiar and ill-advised\ninterviews in presidential history, from a president who had already, several times before,\nachieved that milestone.\nIn the interview, Trump had done his daughter and son-in-law’s increasingly frantic\nbidding. He had, even if to no clear end and without certain strategy, continued on his\ncourse of threatening the attorney general for recusing himself and opening the door to a\nspecial prosecutor. He openly pushed Sessions to resign—mocking and insulting him and\ndaring him to try to stay. However much this seemed to advance no one’s cause, except\nperhaps that of the special prosecutor, Bannon’s incredulity—“Jefferson Beauregard\nSessions is not going to go anywhere”—was most keenly focused on another remarkable\npassage in the interview: the president had admonished the special counsel not to cross the\nline into his family’s finances.\n“Ehhh … ehhh … ehhh!” screeched Bannon, making the sound of an emergency alarm.\n“Don’t look here! Let’s tell a prosecutor what not to look at!”\nBannon then described the conversation he’d had with the president earlier that day: “I\nwent right into him and said, ‘Why did you say that?’ And he says, ‘The Sessions thing?’\nand I say, ‘No, that’s bad, but it’s another day at the office.’ I said, ‘Why did you say it was\noff limits to go after your family’s finances?’ And he says, ‘Well, it is … .’ I go, ‘Hey, they\nare going to determine their mandate… . You may not like it, but you just guaranteed if\nyou want to get anybody else in [the special counsel] slot, every senator will make him\nswear that the first thing he’s going to do is come in and subpoena your fucking tax\nreturns.’ ”\nBannon, with further disbelief, recounted the details of a recent story from the\nFinancial Times about Felix Sater, one of the shadiest of the shady Trump-associated\ncharacters, who was closely aligned with Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael\nCohen (reportedly a target of the Mueller investigation), and a key follow-the-money link\nto Russia. Sater, “get ready for it—I know this may shock you, but wait for it”—had had\nmajor problems with the law before, “caught with a couple of guys in Boca running\nRussian money through a boiler room.” And, it turns out, “Brother Sater” was prosecuted\nby—“wait”—Andrew Weissmann. (Mueller had recently hired Weissmann, a highpowered\nWashington lawyer who headed the DOJ’s criminal fraud division.) “You’ve got\nthe LeBron James of money laundering investigations on you, Jarvanka. My asshole just\ngot so tight!”\nBannon quite literally slapped his sides and then returned to his conversation with the\npresident. “And he goes, ‘That’s not their mandate.’ Seriously, dude?”\nPreate, putting out the Chinese food on a table, said, “It wasn’t their mandate to put\nArthur Andersen out of business during Enron, but that didn’t stop Andrew\nWeissmann”—one of the Enron prosecutors.\n“You realize where this is going,” Bannon continued. “This is all about money\nlaundering. Mueller chose Weissmann first and he is a money laundering guy. Their path\nto fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr., and Jared Kushner … It’s as\nplain as a hair on your face… . It goes through all the Kushner shit. They’re going to roll\nthose two guys up and say play me or trade me. But … ‘executive privilege!’ ” Bannon\nmimicked. “ ‘We’ve got executive privilege!’ There’s no executive privilege! We proved\nthat in Watergate.”\nAn expressive man, Bannon seemed to have suddenly exhausted himself. After a\npause, he added wearily: “They’re sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five.”\nWith his hands in front of him, he mimed something like a force field that would\nisolate him from danger. “It’s not my deal. He’s got the five geniuses around him:\nJarvanka, Hope Hicks, Dina Powell, and Josh Raffel.” He threw up his hands again, this\ntime as if to say Hands off. “I know no Russians, I don’t know nothin’ about nothin’. I’m\nnot being a witness. I’m not hiring a lawyer. It is not going to be my ass in front of a\nmicrophone on national TV answering questions. Hope Hicks is so fucked she doesn’t\neven know it. They are going to lay her out. They’re going to crack Don Junior like an egg\non national TV. Michael Cohen, cracked like an egg. He”—the president—“said to me\neverybody would take that Don Junior meeting with the Russians. I said, ‘Everybody\nwould not take that meeting.’ I said, ‘I’m a naval officer. I’m not going to take a meeting\nwith Russian nationals, and do it in headquarters, are you fucking insane?’ and he says,\n‘But he’s a good boy.’ There were no meetings like that after I took over the campaign.”\nBannon’s tone veered from ad absurdum desperation to resignation.\n“If he fires Mueller it just brings the impeachment quicker. Why not, let’s do it. Let’s\nget it on. Why not? What am I going to do? Am I going to go in and save him? He’s\nDonald Trump. He’s always gonna do things. He wants an unrecused attorney general. I\ntold him if Jeff Sessions goes, Rod Rosenstein goes, and then Rachel Brand”—the\nassociate attorney general, next in line after Rosenstein—“goes, we’ll be digging down\ninto Obama career guys. An Obama guy will be acting attorney general. I said you’re not\ngoing to get Rudy”—Trump had again revived a wish for his loyalists Rudy Giuliani or\nChris Christie to take the job—“because he was on the campaign and will have to recuse\nhimself, and Chris Christie, too, so those are masturbatory fantasies, get those out of your\nbrain. And, for anybody to get confirmed now, they are going to have to swear and ensure\nthat things will go ahead and they won’t fire anybody, because you said yesterday—Ehhh\n… ehhh … .ehhh!—‘my family finances are off limits,’ and they’re going to demand that,\nwhoever he is, he promises and commits to make the family finances part of this\ninvestigation. I told him as night follows day that’s a lock, so you better hope Sessions\nstays around.”\n“He was calling people in New York last night asking what he should do,” added\nPreate. (Almost everybody in the White House followed Trump’s thinking by tracking\nwhom he had called the night before.)\nBannon sat back and, with steam-rising frustration—almost a cartoon figure—he\noutlined his Clinton-like legal plan. “They went to the mattresses with amazing discipline.\nThey ground through it.” But that was about discipline, he emphasized, and Trump, said\nBannon, noting the obvious, was the least disciplined man in politics.\nIt was clear where Mueller and his team were going, said Bannon: they would trace a\nmoney trail through Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, and Jared Kushner\nand roll one or all of them on the president.\nIt’s Shakespearean, he said, enumerating the bad advice from his family circle: “It’s the\ngeniuses, the same people who talked him into firing Comey, the same people on Air\nForce One who cut out his outside legal team, knowing the email was out there, knowing\nthat email existed, put the statement out about Don Junior, that the meeting was all about\nadoptions … the same geniuses trying to get Sessions fired.\n“Look, Kasowitz has known him for twenty-five years. Kasowitz has gotten him out of\nall kinds of jams. Kasowitz on the campaign—what did we have, a hundred women?\nKasowitz took care of all of them. And now he’s out in, what, four weeks? He’s New\nYork’s toughest lawyer. Mark Corallo, toughest motherfucker I ever met, just can’t do it.”\nJared and Ivanka believe, said Bannon, that if they advocate prison reform and save\nDACA—the program to protect the children of illegal immigrants—the liberals will come\nto their defense. He digressed briefly to characterize Ivanka Trump’s legislative acumen,\nand her difficulty—which had become quite a White House preoccupation—in finding\nsponsorship for her family leave proposal. “Here’s why, I keep telling her: there’s no\npolitical constituency in it. You know how easy it is to get a bill sponsored, any\nschmendrick can do it. You know why your bill has no sponsorship? Because people\nrealize how dumb it is.” In fact, said, Bannon, eyes rolling and mouth agape, it was the\nJarvanka idea to try to trade off amnesty for the border wall. “If not the dumbest idea in\nWestern civilization, it’s up there in the top three. Do these geniuses even know who we\nare?”\nJust then Bannon took a call, the caller telling him that it looked as if Scaramucci\nmight indeed be getting the job of communications director. “Don’t fuck with me, dude,”\nhe laughed. “Don’t fuck with me like that!”\nHe got off the phone expressing further wonder at the fantasy world of the geniuses—\nand added, for good measure, an extra dollop of dripping contempt for them. “I literally do\nnot talk to them. You know why? I’m doing my shit, and they got nothing to do with it,\nand I don’t care what they’re doing … I don’t care… . I’m not going to be alone with\nthem, I’m not going to be in a room with them. Ivanka walked into the Oval today …\n[and] as soon as she walked in, I looked at her and walked right out… . I won’t be in a\nroom … don’t want to do it… . Hope Hicks walked in, I walked out.”\n“The FBI put Jared’s father in jail,” said Preate. “Don’t they understand you don’t mess\n—”\n“Charlie Kushner,” said Bannon, smacking his head again in additional disbelief. “He’s\ngoing crazy because they’re going to get down deep in his shit about how he’s financed\neveryfhing… . all the shit coming out of Israel … and all these guys coming out of Eastern\nEurope … all these Russian guys … and guys in Kazakhstan… . And he’s frozen on 666\n[Fifth Avenue]… . [If] it goes under next year, the whole thing’s cross-collateralized …\nhe’s wiped, he’s gone, he’s done, it’s over… . Toast.”\nHe held his face in his hands for a moment and then looked up again.\n“I’m pretty good at coming up with solutions, I came up with a solution for his brokedick\ncampaign in about a day, but I don’t see this. I don’t see a plan for getting through.\nNow, I gave him a plan, I said you seal the Oval Office, you send those two kids home,\nyou get rid of Hope, all these deadbeats, and you listen to your legal team—Kasowitz, and\nMark Dowd, and Jay Sekulow, and Mark Corallo, these are all professionals who have\ndone this many times. You listen to those guys and never talk about this stuff again, you\njust conduct yourself as commander in chief and then you can be president for eight years.\nIf you don’t, you’re not, simple. But he’s the president, he gets a choice, and he’s clearly\nchoosing to go down another path … and you can’t stop him. The guy is going to call his\nown plays. He’s Trump… .”\nAnd then another call came, this one from Sam Nunberg. He, too, was calling about\nScaramucci, and his words caused something like stupefaction in Bannon: “No fucking,\nfucking way.”\nBannon got off the phone and said, “Jesus. Scaramucci. I can’t even respond to this.\nIt’s Kafkaesque. Jared and Ivanka needed somebody to represent their shit. It’s madness.\nHe’ll be on that podium for two days and he’ll be so chopped he’ll bleed out everywhere.\nHe’ll literally blow up in a week. This is why I don’t take this stuff seriously. Hiring\nScaramucci? He’s not qualified to do anything. He runs a fund of funds. Do you know\nwhat a fund of funds is? It’s not a fund. Dude, it’s sick. We look like buffoons.”\n* * *\nThe ten days of Anthony Scaramucci, saw, on the first day, July 21, the resignation of\nSean Spicer. Oddly, this seemed to catch everyone unawares. In a meeting with\nScaramucci, Spicer, and Priebus, the president—who in his announcement of\nScaramucci’s hire as communications director had promoted Scaramucci not only over\nSpicer, but in effect over Priebus, his chief of staff—suggested that the men ought to be\nable to work it out together.\nSpicer went back to his office, printed out his letter of resignation, and then took it\nback to the nonplussed president, who said again that he really wanted Spicer to be a part\nof things. But Spicer, surely the most mocked man in America, understood that he had\nbeen handed a gift. His White House days were over.\nFor Scaramucci, it was now payback time. Scaramucci blamed his six humiliating\nmonths out in the cold on nobody so much as Reince Priebus—having announced his\nWhite House future, having sold his business in anticipation of it, he had come away with\nnothing, or at least nothing of any value. But now, in a reversal befitting a true master of\nthe universe—befitting, actually, Trump himself—Scaramucci was in the White House,\nbigger, better, and grander than even he had had the gall to imagine. And Priebus was dead\nmeat.\nThat was the signal the president had sent Scaramucci—deal with the mess. In Trump’s\nview, the problems in his tenure so far were just problems about the team. If the team\nwent, the problems went. So Scaramucci had his marching orders. The fact that the\npresident had been saying the same stuff about his rotten team from the first day, that this\nriff had been a constant from the campaign on, that he would often say he wanted\neverybody to go and then turn around and say he didn’t want everybody to go—all that\nrather went over Scaramucci’s head.\nScaramucci began taunting Priebus publicly, and inside the West Wing he adopted a\ntough-guy attitude about Bannon—“I won’t take his bullshit.” Trump seemed delighted\nwith this behavior, which led Scaramucci to feel that the president was urging him on.\nJared and Ivanka were pleased, too; they believed they had scored with Scaramucci and\nwere confident that he would defend them against Bannon and the rest.\nBannon and Priebus remained not just disbelieving but barely able not to crack up. For\nboth men, Scaramucci was either a hallucinatory episode—they wondered whether they\nought to just shut their eyes while it passed—or some further march into madness.\n* * *\nEven as measured against other trying weeks in the Trump White House, the week of July\n24 was a head-slammer. First, it opened the next episode in what had become a comicopera\neffort to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. As in the House, this had become much\nless about health care than a struggle both among Republicans in Congress and between\nthe Republican leadership and the White House. The signature stand for the Republican\nParty had now become the symbol of its civil war.\nOn that Monday, the president’s son-in-law appeared at the microphones in front of the\nWest Wing to preview his statement to Senate investigators about the Trump campaign’s\nconnections to Russia. Having almost never spoken before in public, he now denied\nculpability in the Russian mess by claiming feckless naïveté; speaking in a reedy, selfpitying\nvoice, he portrayed himself as a Candide-like figure who had become disillusioned\nby a harsh world.\nAnd that evening, the president traveled to West Virginia to deliver a speech before the\nBoy Scouts of America. Once more, his speech was tonally at odds with time, place, and\ngood sense. It prompted an immediate apology from the Boy Scouts to its members, their\nparents, and the country at large. The quick trip did not seem to improve Trump’s mood:\nthe next morning, seething, the president again publicly attacked his attorney general and\n—for good measure and no evident reason—tweeted his ban of transgender people in the\nmilitary. (The president had been presented with four different options related to the\nmilitary’s transgender policy. The presentation was meant to frame an ongoing discussion,\nbut ten minutes after receiving the discussion points, and without further consultation,\nTrump tweeted his transgender ban.)\nThe following day, Wednesday, Scaramucci learned that one of his financial disclosure\nforms seemed to have been leaked; assuming he’d been sabotaged by his enemies,\nScaramucci blamed Priebus directly, implicitly accusing him of a felony. In fact,\nScaramucci’s financial form was a public document available to all.\nThat afternoon, Priebus told the president that he understood he should resign and they\nshould start talking about his replacement.\nThen, that evening, there was a small dinner in the White House, with various current\nand former Fox News people, including Kimberly Guilfoyle, in attendance—and this was\nleaked. Drinking more than usual, trying desperately to contain the details of the\nmeltdown of his personal life (being linked to Guilfoyle wasn’t going to help his\nnegotiation with his wife), and wired by events beyond his own circuits’ capacity,\nScaramucci called a reporter at the New Yorker magazine and unloaded.\nThe resulting article was surreal—so naked in its pain and fury, that for almost twentyfour\nhours nobody seemed to be able to quite acknowledge that he had committed public\nsuicide. The article quoted Scaramucci speaking bluntly about the chief of staff: “Reince\nPriebus—if you want to leak something—he’ll be asked to resign very shortly.” Saying\nthat he had taken his new job “to serve the country” and that he was “not trying to build\nmy brand,” Scaramucci also took on Steve Bannon: “I’m not Steve Bannon. I’m not trying\nto suck my own cock.” (In fact, Bannon learned about the piece when fact-checkers from\nthe magazine called him for comment about Scaramucci’s accusation that he sucked his\nown cock.)\nScaramucci, who had in effect publicly fired Priebus, was behaving so bizarrely that it\nwasn’t at all clear who would be the last man standing. Priebus, on the verge of being fired\nfor so long, realized that he might have agreed to resign too soon. He might have gotten\nthe chance to fire Scaramucci!\nOn Friday, as health care repeal cratered in the Senate, Priebus joined the president on\nboard Air Force One for a trip to New York for a speech. As it happened, so did\nScaramucci, who, avoiding the New Yorker fallout, had said he’d gone to New York to\nvisit his mother but in fact had been hiding out at the Trump Hotel in Washington. Now\nhere he was, with his bags (he would indeed now stay in New York and visit his mother),\nbehaving as though nothing had happened.\nOn the way back from the trip, Priebus and the president talked on the plane and\ndiscussed the timing of his departure, with the president urging him to do it the right way\nand to take his time. “You tell me what works for you,” said Trump. “Let’s make it good.”\nMinutes later, Priebus stepped onto the tarmac and an alert on his phone said the\npresident had just tweeted that there was a new chief of staff, Department of Homeland\nSecurity chief John Kelly, and that Priebus was out.\nThe Trump presidency was six months old, but the question of who might replace\nPriebus had been a topic of discussion almost from day one. Among the string of\ncandidates were Powell and Cohn, the Jarvanka favorites; OMB director Mick Mulvaney,\none of the Bannon picks; and Kelly.\nIn fact, Kelly—who would soon abjectly apologize to Priebus for the basic lack of\ncourtesy in the way his dismissal was handled—had not been consulted about his\nappointment. The president’s tweet was the first he knew of it.\nBut indeed there was no time to waste. Now the paramount issue before the Trump\ngovernment was that somebody would have to fire Scaramucci. Since Scaramucci had\neffectively gotten rid of Priebus—the person who logically should have fired him—the\nnew chief of staff was needed, more or less immediately, to get rid of the Mooch.\nAnd six days later, just hours after he was sworn in, Kelly fired Scaramucci.\nChastened themselves, the junior first couple, the geniuses of the Scaramucci hire,\npanicked that they would, deservedly, catch the blame for one of the most ludicrous if not\ncatastrophic hires in modern White House history. Now they rushed to say how firmly\nthey supported the decision to get rid of Scaramucci.\n“So I punch you in the face,” Sean Spicer noted from the sidelines, “and then say, ‘Oh\nmy god, we’ve got to get you to a hospital!’ ”\n22\nGENERAL KELLY\nO\nn August 4, the president and key members of the West Wing left for Trump’s golf\nclub in Bedminster. The new chief of staff, General Kelly, was in tow, but the\npresident’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, had been left behind. Trump was grouchy about\nthe planned seventeen-day trip, bothered by how diligently his golf dates were being\nclocked by the media. So this was now dubbed a “working” trip—another piece of Trump\nvanity that drew shrugs, eye rolling, and head shaking from a staff that had been charged\nwith planning events that looked like work even as they were instructed to leave yawning\nexpanses of time for golf.\nDuring the president’s absence, the West Wing would be renovated—Trump, the\nhotelier and decorator, was “disgusted” by its condition. The president did not want to\nmove over to the nearby Executive Office Building, where the West Wing business would\ntemporarily be conducted—and where Steve Bannon sat waiting for his call to go to\nBedminster.\nHe was about to leave for Bedminster, Bannon kept telling everyone, but no invitation\ncame. Bannon, who claimed credit for bringing Kelly into the administration in the first\nplace, was unsure where he stood with the new chief. Indeed, the president himself was\nunsure about where he himself stood; he kept asking people if Kelly liked him. More\ngenerally, Bannon wasn’t entirely clear what Kelly was doing, other than his duty. Where\nexactly did the new chief of staff fit in Trumpworld?\nWhile Kelly stood somewhere right of center on the political spectrum and had been a\nwilling tough immigration enforcer at Homeland Security, he was not anywhere near so\nright as Bannon or Trump. “He’s not hardcore” was Bannon’s regretful appraisal. At the\nsame time, Kelly was certainly not close in any way to the New York liberals in the White\nHouse. But politics was not his purview. As director of Homeland Security he had\nwatched the chaos in the White House with disgust and thought about quitting. Now he\nhad agreed to try to tame it. He was sixty-seven, resolute, stern, and grim. “Does he ever\nsmile?” asked Trump, who had already begun to think that he had somehow been tricked\ninto the hire.\nSome Trumpers, particularly those with over-the-transom access to the president,\nbelieved that he had been tricked into some form of very-much-not-Trump submission.\nRoger Stone, one of those people whose calls Kelly was now shielding the president from,\nspread the dark scenario that Mattis, McMaster, and Kelly had agreed that no military\naction would ever be taken unless the three were in accord—and that at least one of them\nwould always remain in Washington if the others were away.\nAfter Kelly dispatched Scaramucci, his two immediate issues, now on the table in\nBedminster, were the president’s relatives and Steve Bannon. One side or the other\nobviously had to go. Or perhaps both should go.\nIt was far from clear whether a White House chief of staff who saw his function as\nestablishing command process and enforcing organizational hierarchy—directing a\ndecision funnel to the commander in chief—could operate effectively or even exist in a\nWhite House where the commander in chief’s children had special access and overriding\ninfluence. As much as the president’s daughter and son-in-law were now offering slavish\nregard for the new command principals, they would, surely, by habit and temperament,\noverride Kelly’s control of the West Wing. Not only did they have obvious special\ninfluence with the president, but important members of the staff saw them as having this\njuice, and hence believed that they were the true north of West Wing advancement and\npower.\nCuriously, for all their callowness, Jared and Ivanka had become quite a fearsome\npresence, as feared by others as the two of them feared Bannon. What’s more, they had\nbecome quite accomplished infighters and leakers—they had front-room and back-channel\npower—although, with great woundedness, they insisted, incredibly, that they never\nleaked. “If they hear someone talking about them, because they are so careful about their\nimage and have crafted this whole persona—it’s like anyone who tries to pierce it or say\nsomething against it is like a big problem,” said one senior staffer. “They get very upset\nand will come after you.”\nOn the other hand, while “the kids” might make Kelly’s job all but impossible, keeping\nBannon on board didn’t make a lot of sense, either. Whatever his gifts, he was a hopeless\nplotter and malcontent, bound to do an end run around any organization. Besides, as the\nBedminster hiatus—working or otherwise—began, Bannon was once more on the\npresident’s shit list.\nThe president continued to stew about The Devil’s Bargain, the book by Joshua Green\nthat gave Bannon credit for the election. Then, too, while the president tended to side with\nBannon against McMaster, the campaign to defend McMaster, supported by Jared and\nIvanka, was having an effect. Murdoch, enlisted by Jared to help defend McMaster, was\npersonally lobbying the president for Bannon’s head. Bannonites felt they had to defend\nBannon against an impulsive move by the president: so now, not only did they brand\nMcMaster as weak on Israel, they persuaded Sheldon Adelson to lobby Trump—Bannon,\nAdelson told the president, was the only person he trusted on Israel in the White House.\nAdelson’s billions and implacability always impressed Trump, and his endorsement,\nBannon believed, significantly strengthened his hand.\nBut overriding the management of the harrowing West Wing dysfunction, Kelly’s\nsuccess—or even relevance, as he was informed by almost anyone who was in a position\nto offer him an opinion—depended on his rising to the central challenge of his job, which\nwas how to manage Trump. Or, actually, how to live with not managing him. His desires,\nneeds, and impulses had to exist—necessarily had to exist—outside the organizational\nstructure. Trump was the one variable that, in management terms, simply could not be\ncontrolled. He was like a recalcitrant two-year-old. If you tried to control him, it would\nonly have the opposite effect. In this, then, the manager had to most firmly manage his\nown expectations.\nIn an early meeting with the president, General Kelly had Jared and Ivanka on his\nagenda—how the president saw their role; what he thought was working and not working\nabout it; how he envisioned it going forward. It was all intended to be a politic way of\nopening a discussion about getting them out. But the president was, Kelly soon learned,\ndelighted with all aspects of their performance in the West Wing. Maybe at some point\nJared would become secretary of state—that was the only change the president seemed to\nforesee. The most Kelly could do was to get the president to acknowledge that the couple\nshould be part of a greater organizational discipline in the West Wing and should not so\nreadily jump the line.\nThis, at least, was something that the general could try to enforce. At a dinner in\nBedminster—the president dining with his daughter and son-in-law—the First Family\nwere confused when Kelly showed up at the meal and joined them. This, they shortly\ncame to understand, was neither an attempt at pleasant socializing nor an instance of\nunwarranted over-familiarity. It was enforcement: Jared and Ivanka needed to go through\nhim to talk to the president.\nBut Trump had made clear his feeling that the roles played by the kids in his\nadministration needed only minor adjustment, and this now presented a significant\nproblem for Bannon. Bannon really had believed that Kelly would find a way to send\nJarvanka home. How could he not? Indeed, Bannon had convinced himself that they\nrepresented the largest danger to Trump. They would take the president down. As much,\nBannon believed that he could not remain in the White House if they did.\nBeyond Trump’s current irritation with Bannon, which many believed was just the\nusual constant of Trump resentment and complaint, Bannonites felt that their leader had, at\nleast policywise, gained the upper hand. Jarvanka was marginalized; the Republican\nleadership, after health care, was discredited; the Cohn-Mnuchin tax plan was a hash.\nThrough one window, the future looked almost rosy for Bannon. Sam Nunberg, the former\nTrump loyalist who was now wholly a Bannon loyalist, believed that Bannon would stay\nin the White House for two years and then leave to run Trump’s reelection campaign. “If\nyou can get this idiot elected twice,” Nunberg marveled, you would achieve something\nlike immortality in politics.\nBut through another window, Bannon couldn’t possibly remain in place. He seemed to\nhave moved into a heightened state that allowed him to see just how ridiculous the White\nHouse had become. He could barely hold his tongue—indeed, he couldn’t hold it. Pressed,\nhe could not see the future of the Trump administration. And, while many Bannonites\nargued the case for Jarvanka ineffectiveness and irrelevance—just ignore them, they said\n—Bannon, with mounting ferocity and pubic venom, could abide them less and less every\nday.\nBannon, continuing to wait for his call to join the president in Bedminster, decided that\nhe would force the situation and offered his resignation to Kelly. But this was in fact a\ngame of chicken: he wanted to stay. On the other hand, he wanted Jarvanka to go. And\nthat became an effective ultimatum.\n* * *\nAt lunch on August 8, in the Clubhouse at Bedminster—amid Trumpish chandeliers, golf\ntrophies, and tournament plaques—the president was flanked by Tom Price, the secretary\nof health and human services, and his wife, Melania. Kellyanne Conway was at the lunch;\nso were Kushner and several others. This was one of the “make-work” events—over\nlunch, there was a discussion of the opioid crisis, which was then followed by a statement\nfrom the president and a brief round of questions from reporters. While reading the\nstatement in a monotone, Trump kept his head down, propping it on his elbows.\nAfter taking some humdrum questions about opioids, he was suddenly asked about\nNorth Korea, and, quite as though in stop-action animation, he seemed to come alive.\nNorth Korea had been a heavy-on-detail, short-on-answers problem that that he\nbelieved was the product of lesser minds and weaker resolve—and that he had trouble\npaying attention to. What’s more, he had increasingly personalized his antagonism with\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un, referring to him often with derogatory epithets.\nHis staff had not prepared him for this, but, in apparent relief that he could digress\nfrom the opioid discussion, as well as sudden satisfaction at the opportunity to address this\nnagging problem, he ventured out, in language that he’d repeated often in private—as he\nrepeated everything often—to the precipice of an international crisis.\n“North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met\nwith the fire and the fury like the world has never seen. He has been very threatening\nbeyond a normal state, and as I said they will be met with fire and fury and frankly power,\nthe likes of which this world has never seen before. Thank you.”\n* * *\nNorth Korea, a situation the president had been consistently advised to downplay, now\nbecame the central subject of the rest of the week—with most senior staff occupied not so\nmuch by the topic itself, but by how to respond to the president, who was threatening to\n“blow” again.\nAgainst this background, almost no one paid attention to the announcement by the\nTrump supporter and American neo-Nazi Richard Spencer that he was organizing a protest\nat the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, over the removal of a statue of Robert E.\nLee. “Unite the Right,” the theme of the rally called for Saturday, August 12, was\nexplicitly designed to link Trump’s politics with white nationalism.\nOn August 11, with the president in Bedminster continuing to threaten North Korea—\nand also, inexplicably to almost everyone on his staff, threatening military intervention in\nVenezuela—Spencer called for an evening protest.\nAt 8:45 p.m.—with the president in for the night in Bedminster—about 250 young men\ndressed in khaki pants and polo shirts, quite a Trump style of dress, began an organized\nparade across the UVA campus while carrying kerosene torches. Parade monitors with\nheadsets directed the scene. At a signal, the marchers began chanting official movement\nslogans: “Blood and soil!” “You will not replace us!” “Jews will not replace us!” Soon, at\nthe center of campus, near a statue of UVA’s founder, Thomas Jefferson, Spencer’s group\nwas met by a counterprotest. With virtually no police presence, the first of the weekend’s\nmelees and injuries ensued.\nBeginning again at eight o’clock the next morning, the park near the Lee statue became\nthe battleground of a suddenly surging white racist movement, with clubs, shields, mace,\npistols, and automatic rifles (Virginia is an “open carry” state)—a movement seemingly,\nand to liberal horror, born out of the Trump campaign and election, as in fact Richard\nSpencer intended it to seem. Opposing the demonstrators was a hardened, militant left\ncalled to the barricades. You could hardly have better set an end-times scene, no matter the\nlimited numbers of protesters. Much of the morning involved a series of charges and\ncountercharges—a rocks-and-bottles combat, with a seemingly hands-off police force\nstanding by.\nIn Bedminster, there was still little awareness of the unfolding events in Charlottesville.\nBut then, at about one o’clock in the afternoon, James Alex Fields Jr., a twenty-year-old\nwould-be Nazi, plunged his Dodge Charger into a group of counterprotesters, killing\nthirty-two-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring a score of others.\nIn a tweet hurriedly composed by his staff, the president declared: “We ALL must be\nunited & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in\nAmerica. Lets come together as one!”\nOtherwise, however, it was largely business as usual for the president—Charlottesville\nwas a mere distraction, and indeed, the staff’s goal was to keep him off North Korea. The\nmain event in Bedminster that day was the ceremonial signing of an act extending the\nfunding of a program that let veterans obtain medical care outside VA hospitals. The\nsigning was held in a big ballroom at the Clubhouse two hours after Alex Field’s attack.\nDuring the signing, Trump took a moment to condemn the “hatred, bigotry, and\nviolence on many sides” in Charlottesville. Almost immediately, the president came under\nattack for the distinction he had appeared to refuse to draw between avowed racists and\nthe other side. As Richard Spencer had correctly understood, the president’s sympathies\nwere muddled. However easy and obvious it was to condemn white racists—even selfstyled\nneo-Nazis—he instinctively resisted.\nIt wasn’t until the next morning that the White House finally tried to clarify Trump’s\nposition with a formal statement: “The President said very strongly in his statement\nyesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred. Of course that\nincludes white supremacists, KKK neo-Nazi and all extremist groups. He called for\nnational unity and bringing all Americans together.”\nBut in fact he hadn’t condemned white supremacists, KKK, and neo-Nazis—and he\ncontinued to be stubborn about not doing it.\nIn a call to Bannon, Trump sought help making his case: “Where does this all end? Are\nthey going to take down the Washington Monument, Mount Rushmore, Mount Vernon?”\nBannon—still not receiving his summons to Bedminster—urged this to be the line: the\npresident should condemn violence and misfits and also defend history (even with\nTrump’s weak grasp of it). Stressing the literal issue of monuments would bedevil the left\nand comfort the right.\nBut Jared and Ivanka, with Kelly backing them, urged presidential behavior. Their plan\nwas to have Trump return to the White House and address the issue with a forceful\ncensure of hate groups and racial politics—exactly the unambiguous sort of position\nRichard Spencer had strategically bet Trump would not willingly take.\nBannon, understanding these same currents in Trump, lobbied Kelly and told him that\nthe Jarvanka approach would backfire: It will be clear his heart’s not in it, said Bannon.\nThe president arrived shortly before eleven o’clock on Monday morning at a White\nHouse under construction and a wall of shouted questions about Charlottesville: “Do you\ncondemn the actions of neo-Nazis? Do you condemn the actions of white supremacists?”\nSome ninety minutes later he stood in the Diplomatic Reception Room, his eyes locked on\nto the teleprompter, and delivered a six-minute statement.\nBefore getting to the point: “Our economy is now strong. The stock market continues\nto hit record highs, unemployment is at a sixteen-year low, and businesses are more\noptimistic than ever before. Companies are moving back to the United States and bringing\nmany thousands of jobs with them. We have already created over one million jobs since I\ntook office.”\nAnd only then: “We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite\ntogether in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence… . We must rediscover the\nbonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans… . Racism is evil. And\nthose who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs including the KKK, neo-\nNazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold\ndear as Americans.”\nIt was a reluctant mini-grovel. It was something of a restaging of the take-it-back\nbirther speech about Obama during the campaign: much distraction and obfuscation, then\na mumbled acknowledgment. Similarly, he looked here, trying to tow the accepted line on\nCharlottesville, like a kid called on the carpet. Resentful and petulant, he was clearly\nreading forced lines.\nAnd in fact he got little credit for these presidential-style remarks, with reporters\nshouting questions about why it had taken him so long to address the issue. As he got back\non Marine One to head to Andrews Air Force Base and on to JFK and then into Manhattan\nand Trump Tower, his mood was dark and I-told-you-so. Privately, he kept trying to\nrationalize why someone would be a member of the KKK—that is, they might not actually\nbelieve what the KKK believed, and the KKK probably does not believe what it used to\nbelieve, and, anyway, who really knows what the KKK believes now? In fact, he said, his\nown father was accused of being involved with the KKK—not true. (In fact, yes, true.)\nThe next day, Tuesday, August 15, the White House had a news conference scheduled\nat Trump Tower. Bannon urged Kelly to cancel it. It was a nothing conference anyway. Its\npremise was about infrastructure—about undoing an environmental regulation that could\nhelp get projects started faster—but it was really just another effort to show that Trump\nwas working and not just on a holiday. So why bother? What’s more, Bannon told Kelly,\nhe could see the signs: the arrow on the Trump pressure cooker was climbing, and before\nlong he’d blow.\nThe news conference went ahead anyway. Standing at the lectern in the lobby of\nTrump Tower, the president stayed on script for mere minutes. Defensive and selfjustifying,\nhe staked out a contrition-is-bunk, the-fault-lies-everywhere-else position and\nthen dug in deep. He went on without an evident ability to adjust his emotions to political\ncircumstance or, really, even to make an effort to save himself. It was yet one more\nexample, among his many now, of the comic-absurd, movielike politician who just says\nwhatever is on his mind. Unmediated. Crazylike.\n“What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, altright? Do they have\nany semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?\nAs far as I’m concerned that was a horrible, horrible day… . I think there’s blame on both\nsides. I have no doubt about it, you don’t have any doubt about it. If you reported it\naccurately, you would see.”\nSteve Bannon, still waiting in his temporary office in the EOB, thought, Oh my god,\nthere he goes. I told you so.\n* * *\nOutside of the portion of the electorate that, as Trump once claimed, would let him shoot\nsomeone on Fifth Avenue, the civilized world was pretty much universally aghast.\nEverybody came to a dumbfounded moral attention. Anybody in any position of\nresponsibility remotely tied to some idea of establishment respectability had to disavow\nhim. Every CEO of a public company who had associated him- or herself with the Trump\nWhite House now needed to cut the ties. The overriding issue might not even be what\nunreconstructed sentiments he actually seemed to hold in his heart—Bannon averred that\nTrump was not in fact anti-Semitic, but on the other count he wasn’t sure—but that he flatout\ncouldn’t control himself.\nIn the wake of the immolating news conference, all eyes were suddenly on Kelly—this\nwas his baptism of Trump fire. Spicer, Priebus, Cohn, Powell, Bannon, Tillerson, Mattis,\nMnuchin—virtually the entire senior staff and cabinet of the Trump presidency, past and\npresent, had traveled through the stages of adventure, challenge, frustration, battle, selfjustification,\nand doubt, before finally having to confront the very real likelihood that the\npresident they worked for—whose presidency they bore some official responsibility for—\ndidn’t have the wherewithal to adequately function in his job. Now, after less than two\nweeks on the job, it was Kelly’s turn to stand at that precipice.\nThe debate, as Bannon put it, was not about whether the president’s situation was bad,\nbut whether it was Twenty-Fifth-Amendment bad.\n* * *\nTo Bannon, if not to Trump, the linchpin of Trumpism was China. The story of the next\ngeneration, he believed, had been written, and it was about war with China. Commercial\nwar, trade war, cultural war, diplomatic war—it would be an all-encompassing war that\nfew in the United States now understood needed to be fought, and that almost nobody was\nprepared to fight.\nBannon had compiled a list of “China hawks” that crossed political lines, going from\nthe Breitbart gang, to former New Republic editor Peter Beinart—who regarded Bannon\nonly with scorn—and orthodox liberal-progressive stalwart Robert Kuttner, the editor of\nthe small, public policy magazine American Prospect. On Wednesday, August 16, the day\nafter the president’s news conference in Trump Tower, Bannon, out of the blue, called\nKuttner from his EOB office to talk China.\nBy this point, Bannon was all but convinced that he was on the way out of the White\nHouse. He had received no invitation to join the president in Bedminster, a withering sign.\nThat day, he had learned of the appointment of Hope Hicks as interim communications\ndirector—a Jarvanka victory. Meanwhile, the steady whisper from the Jarvanka side\ncontinued about his certain demise; it had become a constant background noise.\nHe was still not sure he would be fired, yet Bannon, in only the second on-the-record\ninterview he had given since the Trump victory, called Kuttner and in effect sealed his\nfate. He would later maintain that the conversation was not on the record. But this was the\nBannon method, in which he merely tempted fate.\nIf Trump was helplessly Trump in his most recent news conference, Bannon was\nhelplessly Bannon in his chat with Kuttner. He tried to prop up what he made sound like a\nweak Trump on China. He corrected, in mocking fashion, the president’s bluster on North\nKorea—“ten million people in Seoul” will die, he declared. And he insulted his internal\nenemies—“they’re wetting themselves.”\nIf Trump was incapable of sounding like a president, Bannon had matched him: he was\nincapable of sounding like a presidential aide.\n* * *\nThat evening, a group of Bannonites gathered near the White House for dinner. The dinner\nwas called for the bar at the Hay-Adams hotel, but Arthur Schwartz, a Bannonite PR man,\ngot into an altercation with the Hay-Adams bartender about switching the television from\nCNN to Fox, where his client, Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman of one of\nthe president’s business councils, was shortly to appear. The business council was\nhemorrhaging its CEO members after the president’s Charlottesville news conference, and\nTrump, in a tweet, had announced that he was disbanding it. (Schwarzman had advised the\npresident that the council was collapsing and that the president ought to at least make it\nlook as if shutting it down was his decision.)\nSchwartz, in high dudgeon, announced that he was checking out of the Hay-Adams and\nmoving to the Trump Hotel. He also insisted that the dinner be moved two blocks away to\nJoe’s, an outpost of Miami’s Joe’s Stone Crab. Matthew Boyle, the Washington political\neditor of Breitbart News, was swept into Schwartz’s furious departure, with Schwartz\nupbraiding the twenty-nine-year-old for lighting a cigarette. “I don’t know anyone who\nsmokes,” he sniffed. Although Schwartz was firmly in the Bannon camp, this seemed to\nbe a general dig at the Breitbart people for being low-class.\nBoth dedicated Bannonites debated the effect of Bannon’s interview, which had caught\neverybody in the Bannon universe off guard. Neither man could understand why he would\nhave given an interview.\nWas Bannon finished?\nNo, no, no, argued Schwartz. He might have been a few weeks ago when Murdoch had\nganged up with McMaster and gone to the president and pressed him to dump Bannon.\nBut then Sheldon had fixed it, Schwartz said.\n“Steve stayed home when Abbas came,” said Schwartz. “He wasn’t going to breathe\nthe air that a terrorist breathed.” This was the precise line Schwartz would hand out to\nreporters in the coming days in a further effort to establish Bannon’s right-wing virtue.\nAlexandra Preate, Bannon’s lieutenant, arrived at Joe’s out of breath. Seconds later,\nJason Miller, another PR man in the Bannon fold, arrived. During the transition, Miller\nhad been slated to be the communications director, but then it had come out that Miller\nhad had a relationship with another staff member who announced in a tweet she was\npregnant by Miller—as was also, at this point, Miller’s wife. Miller, who had lost his\npromised White House job but continued serving as an outside Trump and Bannon voice,\nwas now, with the recent birth of the child—with the recent birth of both of his children by\ndifferent women—facing another wave of difficult press. Still, even he was obsessively\nfocused on what Bannon’s interview might mean.\nBy now the table was buzzing with speculation.\nHow would the president react?\nHow would Kelly react?\nWas this curtains?\nFor a group of people in touch with Bannon on an almost moment-by-moment basis, it\nwas remarkable that nobody seemed to understand that, forcibly or otherwise, he would\nsurely be moving out of the White House. On the contrary, the damaging interview was,\nby consensus, converted into a brilliant strategic move. Bannon was not going anywhere\n—not least because there was no Trump without Bannon.\nIt was an excited dinner, a revved-up occasion involving a passionate group of people\nall attached to the man who they believed was the most compelling figure in Washington.\nThey saw him as some sort of irreducible element: Bannon was Bannon was Bannon.\nAs the evening went on, Matt Boyle got in a furious text-message fight with Jonathan\nSwan, a White House reporter who had written a story about Bannon being on the losing\nside in the Bannon-McMaster showdown. Soon almost every well-connected reporter in\nthe city was checking in with somebody at the table. When a text came in, the recipient\nwould hold up his or her phone if it showed a notable reporter’s name. At one point,\nBannon texted Schwartz some talking points. Could it be that this was just one more day\nin the endless Trump drama?\nSchwartz, who seemed to regard Trump’s stupidity as a political given, offered a\nvigorous analysis of why Trump could not do without Bannon. Then, seeking more proof\nof his theory, Schwartz said he was texting Sam Nunberg, generally regarded as the man\nwho understood Trump’s whims and impulses best, and who had sagely predicted\nBannon’s survival at each doubtful moment in the past months.\n“Nunberg always knows,” said Schwartz.\nSeconds later, Schwartz looked up. His eyes widened and for a moment he went silent.\nThen he said: “Nunberg says Bannon’s dead.”\nAnd, indeed, unbeknownst to the Bannonites, even those closest to him, Bannon was at\nthat moment finalizing his exit with Kelly. By the next day, he would be packing up his\nlittle office, and on Monday, when Trump would return to a refurbished West Wing—a\npaint job, new furniture, and new rugs, its look tilting toward the Trump Hotel—Steve\nBannon would be back on Capitol Hill at the Breitbart Embassy, still, he was confident,\nthe chief strategist for the Trump revolution.\nEPILOGUE:\nBANNON AND TRUMP\nO\nn a sweltering morning in October 2017, the man who had more or less singlehandedly\nbrought about the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, stood on\nthe steps of the Breitbart town house and said, with a hearty laugh, “I guess global\nwarming is real.”\nSteve Bannon had lost twenty pounds since his exit from the White House six weeks\nbefore—he was on a crash all-sushi diet. “That building,” said his friend David Bossie,\nspeaking about all White Houses but especially the Trump White House, “takes perfectly\nhealthy people and turns them into old, unhealthy people.” But Bannon, who Bossie had\ndeclared on virtual life support during his final days in the West Wing, was again, by his\nown description, “on fire.” He had moved out of the Arlington “safe house” and\nreestablished himself back at the Breitbart Embassy, turning it into a headquarters for the\nnext stage of the Trump movement, which might not include Trump at all.\nAsked about Trump’s leadership of the nationalist-populist movement, Bannon\nregistered a not inconsiderable change in the country’s political landscape: “I am the\nleader of the national-populist movement.”\nOne cause of Bannon’s boast and new resolve was that Trump, for no reason that\nBannon could quite divine, had embraced Mitch McConnell’s establishment candidate in\nthe recent Republican run-off in Alabama rather than support the nat-pop choice for the\nSenate seat vacated by now attorney general Jeff Sessions. After all, McConnell and the\npresident were barely on speaking terms. From his August “working holiday” in\nBedminster, the president’s staff had tried to organize a makeup meeting with McConnell,\nbut McConnell’s staff had sent back word that it wouldn’t be possible because the Senate\nleader would be getting a haircut.\nBut the president—ever hurt and confused by his inability to get along with the\ncongressional leadership, and then, conversely, enraged by their refusal to get along with\nhim—had gone all-in for the McConnell-backed Luther Strange, who had run against\nBannon’s candidate, the right-wing firebrand Roy Moore. (Even by Alabama standards,\nMoore was far right: he had been removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court\nfor defying a federal court order to take down a monument of the Ten Commandments in\nthe Alabama judicial building.)\nFor Bannon, the president’s political thinking had been obtuse at best. He was unlikely\nto get anything from McConnell—and indeed Trump had demanded nothing for his\nsupport for Luther Strange, which came via an unplanned tweet in August. Strange’s\nprospects were not only dim, but he was likely to lose in a humiliating fashion. Roy\nMoore was the clear candidate of the Trump base—and he was Bannon’s candidate.\nHence, that would be the contest: Trump against Bannon. In fact, the president really\ndidn’t have to support anyone—no one would have complained if he’d stayed neutral in a\nprimary race. Or, he could have tacitly supported Strange and not doubled down with\nmore and more insistent tweets.\nFor Bannon, this episode was not only about the president’s continuing and curious\nconfusion about what he represented, but about his mercurial, intemperate, and often\ncockamamie motivations. Against all political logic, Trump had supported Luther Strange,\nhe told Bannon, because “Luther’s my friend.”\n“He said it like a nine-year-old,” said Bannon, recoiling, and noting that there was no\nuniverse in which Trump and Strange were actually friends.\nFor every member of the White House senior staff this would be the lasting conundrum\nof dealing with President Trump: the “why” of his often baffling behavior.\n“The president fundamentally wants to be liked” was Katie Walsh’s analysis. “He just\nfundamentally needs to be liked so badly that it’s always … everything is a struggle for\nhim.”\nThis translated into a constant need to win something—anything. Equally important, it\nwas essential that he look like a winner. Of course, trying to win without consideration,\nplan, or clear goals had, in the course of the administration’s first nine months, resulted in\nalmost nothing but losses. At the same time, confounding all political logic, that lack of a\nplan, that impulsivity, that apparent joie de guerre, had helped create the disruptiveness\nthat seemed to so joyously shatter the status quo for so many.\nBut now, Bannon thought, that novelty was finally wearing off.\nFor Bannon, the Strange-Moore race had been a test of the Trump cult of personality.\nCertainly Trump continued to believe that people were following him, that he was the\nmovement—and that his support was worth 8 to 10 points in any race. Bannon had\ndecided to test this thesis and to do it as dramatically as possible. All told, the Senate\nRepublican leadership and others spent $32 million on Strange’s campaign, while Moore’s\ncampaign spent $2 million.\nTrump, though aware of Strange’s deep polling deficit, had agreed to extend his\nsupport in a personal trip. But his appearance in Huntsville, Alabama, on September 22,\nbefore a Trump-size crowd, was a political flatliner. It was a full-on Trump speech, ninety\nminutes of rambling and improvisation—the wall would be built (now it was a seethrough\nwall), Russian interference in the U.S. election was a hoax, he would fire anybody\non his cabinet who supported Moore. But, while his base turned out en masse, still drawn\nto Trump the novelty, his cheerleading for Luther Strange drew at best a muted response.\nAs the crowd became restless, the event threatened to become a hopeless embarrassment.\nReading his audience and desperate to find a way out, Trump suddenly threw out a line\nabout Colin Kaepernick taking to his knee while the national anthem played at a National\nFootball League game. The line got a standing ovation. The president thereupon promptly\nabandoned Luther Strange for the rest of the speech. Likewise, for the next week he\ncontinued to whip the NFL. Pay no attention to Strange’s resounding defeat five days after\nthe event in Huntsville. Ignore the size and scale of Trump’s rejection and the Moore-\nBannon triumph, with its hint of new disruptions to come. Now Trump had a new topic,\nand a winning one: the Knee.\n* * *\nThe fundamental premise of nearly everybody who joined the Trump White House was,\nThis can work. We can help make this work. Now, only three-quarters of the way through\njust the first year of Trump’s term, there was literally not one member of the senior staff\nwho could any longer be confident of that premise. Arguably—and on many days\nindubitably—most members of the senior staff believed that the sole upside of being part\nof the Trump White House was to help prevent worse from happening.\nIn early October, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s fate was sealed—if his obvious\nambivalence toward the president had not already sealed it—by the revelation that he had\ncalled the president “a fucking moron.”\nThis—insulting Donald Trump’s intelligence—was both the thing you could not do and\nthe thing—drawing there-but-for-the-grace-of-God guffaws across the senior staff—that\neverybody was guilty of. Everyone, in his or her own way, struggled to express the baldly\nobvious fact that the president did not know enough, did not know what he didn’t know,\ndid not particularly care, and, to boot, was confident if not serene in his unquestioned\ncertitudes. There was now a fair amount of back-of-the-classroom giggling about who had\ncalled Trump what. For Steve Mnuchin and Reince Priebus, he was an “idiot.” For Gary\nCohn, he was “dumb as shit.” For H. R. McMaster he was a “dope.” The list went on.\nTillerson would merely become yet another example of a subordinate who believed\nthat his own abilities could somehow compensate for Trump’s failings.\nAligned with Tillerson were the three generals, Mattis, McMasters, and Kelly, each\nseeing themselves as representing maturity, stability, and restraint. And each, of course,\nwas resented by Trump for it. The suggestion that any or all of these men might be more\nfocused and even tempered than Trump himself was cause for sulking and tantrums on the\npresident’s part.\nThe daily discussion among senior staffers, those still there and those now gone—all of\nwhom had written off Tillerson’s future in the Trump administration—was how long\nGeneral Kelly would last as chief of staff. There was something of a virtual office pool,\nand the joke was that Reince Priebus was likely to be Trump’s longest-serving chief of\nstaff. Kelly’s distaste for the president was open knowledge—in his every word and\ngesture he condescended to Trump—the president’s distaste for Kelly even more so. It was\nsport for the president to defy Kelly, who had become the one thing in his life he had\nnever been able to abide: a disapproving and censorious father figure.\n* * *\nThere really were no illusions at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Kelly’s long-suffering\nantipathy toward the president was rivaled only by his scorn for the president’s family\n—“Kushner,” he pronounced, was “insubordinate.” Cohn’s derisive contempt for Kushner\nas well as the president was even greater. In return, the president heaped more abuse on\nCohn—the former president of Goldman Sachs was now a “complete idiot, dumber than\ndumb.” In fact, the president had also stopped defending his own family, wondering when\nthey would “take the hint and go home.”\nBut, of course, this was still politics: those who could overcome shame or disbelief—\nand, despite all Trumpian coarseness and absurdity, suck up to him and humor him—\nmight achieve unique political advantage. As it happened, few could.\nBy October, however, many on the president’s staff took particular notice of one of the\nfew remaining Trump opportunists: Nikki Haley, the UN ambassador. Haley—“as\nambitious as Lucifer,” in the characterization of one member of the senior staff—had\nconcluded that Trump’s tenure would last, at best, a single term, and that she, with\nrequisite submission, could be his heir apparent. Haley had courted and befriended Ivanka,\nand Ivanka had brought her into the family circle, where she had become a particular\nfocus of Trump’s attention, and he of hers. Haley, as had become increasingly evident to\nthe wider foreign policy and national security team, was the family’s pick for secretary of\nstate after Rex Tillerson’s inevitable resignation. (Likewise, in this shuffle, Dina Powell\nwould replace Haley at the UN.)\nThe president had been spending a notable amount of private time with Haley on Air\nForce One and was seen to be grooming her for a national political future. Haley, who was\nmuch more of a traditional Republican, one with a pronounced moderate streak—a type\nincreasingly known as a Jarvanka Republican—was, evident to many, being mentored in\nTrumpian ways. The danger here, offered one senior Trumper, “is that she is so much\nsmarter than him.”\nWhat now existed, even before the end of the president’s first year, was an effective\npower vacuum. The president, in his failure to move beyond daily chaos, had hardly\nseized the day. But, as sure as politics, someone would.\nIn that sense, the Trumpian and Republican future was already moving beyond this\nWhite House. There was Bannon, working from the outside and trying to take over the\nTrump movement. There was the Republican leadership in Congress, trying to stymie\nTrumpism—if not slay it. There was John McCain, doing his best to embarrass it. There\nwas the special counsel’s office, pursuing the president and many of those around him.\nThe stakes were very clear to Bannon. Haley, quite an un-Trumpian figure, but by far\nthe closest of any of his cabinet members to him, might, with clever political wiles, entice\nTrump to hand her the Trumpian revolution. Indeed, fearing Haley’s hold on the president,\nBannon’s side had—the very morning that Bannon had stood on the steps of the Breitbart\ntown house in the unseasonable October weather—gone into overdrive to push the CIA’s\nMike Pompeo for State after Tillerson’s departure.\nThis was all part of the next stage of Trumpism—to protect it from Trump.\n* * *\nGeneral Kelly was conscientiously and grimly trying to purge the West Wing chaos. He\nhad begun by compartmentalizing the sources and nature of the chaos. The overriding\nsource, of course, was the president’s own eruptions, which Kelly could not control and\nhad resigned himself to accepting. As for the ancillary chaos, much of it had been calmed\nby the elimination of Bannon, Priebus, Scaramucci, and Spicer, with the effect of making\nit quite a Jarvanka-controlled West Wing.\nNow, nine months in, the administration faced the additional problem that it was very\nhard to hire anyone of stature to replace the senior people who had departed. And the\nstature of those who remained seemed to be more diminutive by the week.\nHope Hicks, at twenty-eight, and Stephen Miller, at thirty-two, both of whom had\nbegun as effective interns on the campaign, were now among the seniormost figures in the\nWhite House. Hicks had assumed command of the communications operation, and Miller\nhad effectively replaced Bannon as the senior political strategist.\nAfter the Scaramucci fiasco, and the realization that the position of communications\ndirector would be vastly harder to fill, Hicks was assigned the job as the “interim”\ndirector. She was given the interim title partly because it seemed implausible that she was\nqualified to run an already battered messaging operation, and partly because if she was\ngiven the permanent job everyone would assume that the president was effectively calling\nthe daily shots. But by the middle of September, interim was quietly converted to\npermanent.\nIn the larger media and political world, Miller—who Bannon referred to as “my\ntypist”—was a figure of ever increasing incredulity. He could hardly be taken out in public\nwithout engaging in some screwball, if not screeching, fit of denunciation and grievance.\nHe was the de facto crafter of policy and speeches, and yet up until now he had largely\nonly taken dictation.\nMost problematic of all, Hicks and Miller, along with everyone on the Jarvanka side,\nwere now directly connected to actions involved in the Russian investigation or efforts to\nspin it, deflect it, or, indeed, cover it up. Miller and Hicks had drafted—or at least typed—\nKushner’s version of the first letter written at Bedminster to fire Comey. Hicks had joined\nwith Kushner and his wife to draft on Air Force One the Trump-directed press release\nabout Don Jr. and Kushner’s meeting with the Russians in Trump Tower.\nIn its way, this had become the defining issue for the White House staff: who had been\nin what inopportune room. And even beyond the general chaos, the constant legal danger\nformed part of the high barrier to getting people to come work in the West Wing.\nKushner and his wife—now largely regarded as a time bomb inside the White House—\nwere spending considerable time on their own defense and battling a sense of mounting\nparanoia, not least about what members of the senior staff who had already exited the\nWest Wing might now say about them. Kushner, in the middle of October, would,\ncuriously, add to his legal team Charles Harder, the libel lawyer who had defended both\nHulk Hogan in his libel suit against Gawker, the Internet gossip site, and Melania Trump\nin her suit against the Daily Mail. The implied threat to media and to critics was clear.\nTalk about Jared Kushner at your peril. It also likely meant that Donald Trump was yet\nmanaging the White House’s legal defense, slotting in his favorite “tough guy” lawyers.\nBeyond Donald Trump’s own daily antics, here was the consuming issue of the White\nHouse: the ongoing investigation directed by Robert Mueller. The father, the daughter, the\nson-in-law, his father, the extended family exposure, the prosecutor, the retainers looking\nto save their own skins, the staffers who Trump had rewarded with the back of his hand—\nit all threatened, in Bannon’s view, to make Shakespeare look like Dr. Seuss.\nEveryone waited for the dominoes to fall, and to see how the president, in his fury,\nmight react and change the game again.\n* * *\nSteve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the\nMueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent\nchance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on\nthe Twenty-Fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event\nof his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term.\nIn any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one.\n“He’s not going to make it,” said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. “He’s lost his\nstuff.”\nLess volubly, Bannon was telling people something else: he, Steve Bannon, was going\nto run for president in 2020. The locution, “If I were president …” was turning into,\n“When I am president …”\nThe top Trump donors from 2016 were in his camp, Bannon claimed: Sheldon\nAdelson, the Mercers, Bernie Marcus, and Peter Thiel. In short order, and as though he\nhad been preparing for this move for some time, Bannon had left the White House and\nquickly thrown together a rump campaign organization. The heretofore behind-the-scenes\nBannon was methodically meeting with every conservative leader in the country—doing\nhis best, as he put it, to “kiss the ass and pay homage to all the gray-beards.” And he was\nkeynoting a list of must-attend conservative events.\n“Why is Steve speaking? I didn’t know he spoke,” the president remarked with\npuzzlement and rising worry to aides.\nTrump had been upstaged in other ways as well. He had been scheduled for a major 60\nMinutes interview in September, but this was abruptly canceled after Bannon’s 60 Minutes\ninterview with Charlie Rose on September 11. The president’s advisers felt he shouldn’t\nput himself in a position where he would be compared with Bannon. The worry among\nstaffers—all of them concerned that Trump’s rambling and his alarming repetitions (the\nsame sentences delivered with the same expressions minutes apart) had significantly\nincreased, and that his ability to stay focused, never great, had notably declined—was that\nhe was likely to suffer by such a comparison. Instead, the interview with Trump was\noffered to Sean Hannity—with a preview of the questions.\nBannon was also taking the Breitbart opposition research group—the same forensic\naccountant types who had put together the damning Clinton Cash revelations—and\nfocusing it on what he characterized as the “political elites.” This was a catchall list of\nenemies that included as many Republicans as Democrats.\nMost of all, Bannon was focused on fielding candidates for 2018. While the president\nhad repeatedly threatened to support primary challenges against his enemies, in the end,\nwith his aggressive head start, it was Bannon who would be leading these challenges. It\nwas Bannon spreading fear in the Republican Party, not Trump. Indeed, Bannon was\nwilling to pick outré if not whacky candidates—including former Staten Island\ncongressman Michael Grimm, who had done a stint in federal prison—to demonstrate, as\nhe had demonstrated with Trump, the scale, artfulness, and menace of Bannon-style\npolitics. Although the Republicans in the 2018 congressional races were looking,\naccording to Bannon’s numbers, at a 15-point deficit, it was Bannon’s belief that the more\nextreme the right-wing challenge appeared, the more likely the Democrats would field\nleft-wing nutters even less electable than right-wing nutters. The disruption had just\nbegun.\nTrump, in Bannon’s view, was a chapter, or even a detour, in the Trump revolution,\nwhich had always been about weaknesses in the two major parties. The Trump presidency\n—however long it lasted—had created the opening that would provide the true outsiders\ntheir opportunity. Trump was just the beginning.\nStanding on the Breitbart steps that October morning, Bannon smiled and said: “It’s\ngoing to be wild as shit.”\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI am grateful to Janice Min and Matthew Belloni at the Hollywood Reporter, who,\neighteen months ago, got me up one morning to jump on a plane in New York and that\nevening interview the unlikely candidate in Los Angeles.

Once again, almost a\npleasure.\nMany friends, colleagues, and generous people in the greater media and political world\nhave made this a smarter book, among them Mike Allen, Jonathan Swan, John Homans,\nFranklin Foer, Jack Shafer, Tammy Haddad, Leela de Kretser, Stevan Keane, Matt Stone,\nEdward Jay Epstein, Simon Dumenco, Tucker Carlson, Joe Scarborough, Piers Morgan,\nJuleanna Glover, Niki Christoff, Dylan Jones, Michael Ledeen, Mike Murphy, Tim Miller,\nLarry McCarthy, Benjamin Ginsberg, Al From, Kathy Ruemmler, Matthew Hiltzik, Lisa\nDallos, Mike Rogers, Joanna Coles, Steve Hilton, Michael Schrage, Matt Cooper, Jim\nImpoco, Michael Feldman, Scott McConnell, and Mehreen Maluk.\nMy appreciation to fact-checkers Danit Lidor, Christina Goulding, and Joanne Gerber.\nMy greatest thanks to Victoria Floethe, for her support, patience, and insights, and for\nher good grace in letting this book take such a demanding place in our lives.\nINDEX\nAbbas, Mahmoud, 231, 299\nAbe, Shinzō, 106\nAbraham Lincoln, USS, 182\nAbramovich, Roman, 80\nAdelson, Sheldon, 6, 141–43, 178, 289, 309\nAfghanistan, 42, 263–68, 275–76\nAgalarov, Aras, 254\nAgenda, The (Woodward), 116\nAiles, Beth, 1, 4, 223–24\nAiles, Roger, 1–8, 11, 24, 26, 57, 59–60, 147, 164, 178–79, 195–98, 210, 212, 222–23\nAlabama, 301–3\nAl Shayrat airfield strike, 193–94\nalt-right, 59, 116, 121, 128–29, 137–38, 174, 180, 296\nAmerican Prospect, 297\nAnbang Insurance Group, 211\nanti-Semitism, 140–44, 296\nAnton, Michael, 105–6, 185, 229\nApprentice, The (TV show), 30, 76, 92, 109, 200\nArif, Tevfik, 100\nArmey, Dick, 81\nArthur Andersen, 278\nArt of the Deal, The (Trump and Schwartz), 22\nAssad, Bashar al-, 183, 190\nAtlantic City, 30, 99, 210\nAtwater, Lee, 57\nAustralia, 78\nAyers, Nick, 240\nAzerbaijan, 254\nBahrain, 231\nBaier, Bret, 159–60\nBaker, James, 27, 34\nBaker, Peter, 277\nBannon, Steve, 185, 209, 247\nAfghanistan and, 263–68\nagenda of, in White House, 115–21, 275–77\nagenda of, post-firing, 301–10\nalt-right and, 137–38\nbackground of, 55–60\ncampaign and, 3, 12–13, 17–18, 55, 86, 112–13, 201\nCharlottesville and, 294–96\nChina and, 7–8, 297\nCohn and, 144, 146, 186\nComey firing and, 169–70, 211–15, 217–18, 232–33, 245–46, 261\nCPAC and, 126–34\neve of inauguration and, 4–10\nfirst weeks of presidency and, 52–55, 60–65, 67–70\nFlynn and, 95, 103, 106\nimmigration and, 61–65, 77, 113\ninauguration and, 42–43, 148\ninfluence of, 70, 85, 108–10, 188\nisolationism of, 227\nIsrael and, 140–43\nIvanka and, 146–48, 186–87, 211, 218–19, 221, 257\nJarvanka vs., 140, 174–82, 235–39, 243, 257, 261–62, 272, 274, 277, 280–81, 289–91\nKelly and, 287–91, 294–97\nKushner and, 69–70, 72, 77, 87, 110, 132, 134, 140–48\nKuttner call and firing of, 297–300, 307\nmedia and, 38, 90–91, 93, 195–97, 206–9, 222\nNSC and, 103, 176, 190–92\nObamacare and, 165–67, 170–72, 175\nParis Climate Accord and, 238–39\nPence and, 124\nPriebus and, 33–34, 110\nrole of, in early presidency, 31–35\nRussia investigation and, 7, 95, 97, 101, 154–55, 157, 170, 211, 233–46, 254–55, 257, 260–62, 278–81, 308\nRyan and, 161–63\nSaudi Arabia and, 229–30\nScaramucci and, 268, 271, 274, 277, 281–85\nSessions and, 155, 241–42, 277–78\nSyria and, 190–94\nTrump on, 122–23\nTrump pressured to fire, 173–82\nTrump’s personality and, 21, 23, 35, 45, 47–48, 148–49, 158\nTrump’s Times interview and, 277–78\nWhite House appointments and, 4, 36, 86–87, 89, 189, 285\nBarra, Mary, 88\nBarrack, Tom, 27–29, 33, 42, 85, 233, 240\nBartiromo, Maria, 205\nBass, Edward, 56\nBayrock Group, 100–102\nBedminster Golf Club, 165, 213–14, 216, 287–94, 297, 302, 307\nBeinart, Peter, 297\nBenghazi, 97\nBerkowitz, Avi, 143\nBerlusconi, Silvio, 100\nBerman, Mark, 78\nBest and the Brightest, The (Halberstam), 53–54\nBezos, Jeff, 35\nBiosphere 2, 56\nBlackstone Group, 35, 78, 87, 298\nBlackwater, 265\nBlair, Tony, 156–58, 228\nBlankfein, Lloyd, 144\nBloomberg, Michael, 117\nBoehner, John, 26, 161\nBoeing, 88\nBolton, John, 4–5, 189\nborder wall, 77–78, 228, 280, 303\nBossie, David, 58, 144, 177, 234, 237, 301\nBowles, Erskine, 27\nBoyle, Matthew, 298–300\nBoy Scouts of America, 284\nBrady, Tom, 50\nBrand, Rachel, 279\nBreitbart, Andrew, 58–59\nBreitbart News, 2, 32, 58–59, 62, 121, 126–29, 138, 160–62, 167, 179–80, 196, 207–8, 237, 266, 275, 297–98, 309\nBrennan, John, 6, 41\nBrexit, 5\nBritain, 70, 157\nBrooks, Mel, 15\nBryan, William Jennings, 45\nBrzezinski, Mika, 66–69, 121, 176, 247–49\nBrzezinski, Zbigniew, 66\nBuckley, William F., 127\nBush, Billy, 10, 13–14, 34, 86, 96, 161\nBush, George H.
