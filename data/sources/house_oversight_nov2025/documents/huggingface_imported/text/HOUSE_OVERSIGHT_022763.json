  "text": "prosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and various\nfriends, associates, and lovers, or offers what seems to be unprecedented\ndeal in which Epstein’s lawyers (not federal prosecutors, but Epstein’s\nlawyers, in some ultimate act of self incrimination) have to go to the Palm\nBeach authorities and convince them to up the charges to an offense that will\nsend him to jail and get him a sex offender status. Except that a solicitation\ncharge won’t produce that result. Therefore he has to agree to a procurement\nor pimping charge (even though he has paid money, not received it—the sine\nqua non of pimping). What’s more, in a unique, if not unprecedented\narrangement, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the girls who\nwant to sue him—and, not to defend himself from their suits—forcing him\nto settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-figure sums or\nmore.\n\nHe’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while\nEpstein is now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short his\nsentence, almost all Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their officially\nsentenced time).\n\nJail hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo\nRodriguez, steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with\nEpstein’s activities—but he tries to sell it to an undercover agent. Rodriguez\nis sentenced to 18 months in jail on a charge of theft and of withholding\nevidence (it is not so much a journal as a list of phone numbers, which were\napparently collected or saved by Rod Rodriguez; all of this material was\nsubsequently included in a court filing by Edwards). Scott Rothstein, a\nlawyer whose firm represented additional girls in their suits against Epstein,\nalso goes to jail for recruiting investors to pay for these suits on the\nfraudulent basis that settlements had already been reached. It’s the largest\nfraud in Florida history and Rothstein receives a 50-year sentence.\n\nThen, Brad Edwards, Rothstein’s former partner, sues the federal\ngovernment in 2008 for abridging the rights of two of the original\ncomplainants under the Crime Victim Rights Act (giving victims the right to\nbe consulted about the disposition of their cases) regarding the Justice\nDepartments agreement not to prosecute in favor of the state action. In 2014,\nEdwards tries to ad Virginia Roberts, another of the original complainants,\nwho has previously settled with Epstein, to the long-running suit. Roberts\nwho was paid a settlement under the original terms of Epstein’s agreement—\nthat he would pay attorney’s fees and not oppose any law suits against\nhim—is now trying to overturn the agreement under which she was paid,\nand, with Edwards, further suing Epstein for $50,000,000.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022763",
