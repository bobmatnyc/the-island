Yes, a social contract of sorts exists between\nthese citizens and their regimes: in return for impressive economic-\ngrowth rates the people agree to forego their desire to replace their\nleaders. (Truly, East Asian autocracies have not robbed people of\ntheir dignity the way Middle Eastern ones have.) But even as such\ngrowth rates continue unabated—to say nothing of if they collapse or\neven slow down—at higher income levels, this social contract may\npeter out. For as people become middle class, they gain access to\nglobal culture and trends, which prompts a desire for political\nfreedoms to go along with their personal ones. This is why\nauthoritarian capitalism may be just a phase, rather than a viable\nalternative to Western democracy.\n\nTo be sure, once the basic issues of food and security have been\naddressed, pace Mill and Berlin, democracy retains a better\npossibility of getting it right than autocracy. This is because virtuous\nautocracies are hard to come by and usually rely on the genius of\npersonality; whereas democracy, regardless of the personalities\ninvolved, is systemically better positioned to lead citizenries along\nthe path of development. Of course, we will have to wait until\nChina’s economic growth slows down, or, failing that, continues until\nenough Chinese have more access to global culture. Only then can we\nreally begin to draw conclusions about whether democracy represents\nthe final triumph of reason in politics.\n\nThe genius of both Rome and America lies ultimately in their\ninstitutions, which allowed in the first place for their freedoms.
