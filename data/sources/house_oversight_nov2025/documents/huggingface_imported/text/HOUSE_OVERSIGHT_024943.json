  "text": "growth? And at what percent?\n\nWe are confident that our national establishments’ abilities, combined with the economic measures undertaken\nby the government, will lead to economic growth this year. Yet, we expect that growth may not come at the\nsame rate of pervious growth records we sustained over the past few years. While speculating global economic\ncontraction of 0.5 percent, international financial bodies forecast a slight growth for the UAE economy. Other\nforecasts speculate a 3 percent growth for the UAE economy.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nMaybe every cloud has a silver lining. The financial crisis has restored balance to the\nmarkets following years of inflation which posed a threat to Dubai’s and the UAE’s\neconomies. Do you see this tough correction, for instance to the real estate market, a good\nsolution to a problem that could have escalated in the future?\n\nSometimes opportunities are born from the wombs of crises. The most important thing is to focus on the future\nand develop appropriate frameworks that guarantee highest levels of performance on heels of the crisis.\nMeasures undertaken by the government on both local and federal levels will ensure that we shall emerge from\nthe global financial crisis with least damage. The UAE has proven remarkable ability in facing and overcoming\nprevious crises. Specialized committees and task forces are closely monitoring the development of the global\ncrisis and analyzing its impacts on our economy and subsequently propose action plans to resiliently cope with\nthese ongoing changes.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nMany rumors are targeting Dubai claiming it has turned into a ghost city and that tens of\nthousands are being laid off every week. Don’t you feel upset about these rumors and the\nway the impact of the crisis has been perceived outside Dubai?\n\nActually, we don’t pay attention to rumors and our response always comes in actions rather than words. As a\nmatter of fact, Dubai visitors these days are surprised by these rumors and I’ve met with many of them recently\nand they expressed their amazement at Dubai’s traffic jams, overbooked hotels and crowded markets.\n\nDubai’s success -- which it has sustained over the past years -- is the true reason behind this type of mixed\nreports. Those who spread such rumors -- are they aware of the fact that global nature of Dubai makes it more\nsub ject to impacts of global changes than any other city? We totally endorse freedom of expression but we\nalways urge responsible freedom that promotes principles of integrity and objectivity.\n\nIt is truly sad to find international publications that have usually boasted about factual and precise reporting\nissuing articles based on mere rumors and baseless speculations. We are fully aware of the hidden fierce global\neconomic competition between different parties who are in the same line of business. When a city or a country\ndecides to integrate itself as an effective international player, it should not expect an easy journey full of roses\nand good wishes.\n\nDo you know how many major international airlines are closely monitoring Emirates’ performance? Do you\nthink that international port services companies are happy with the success accomplished by DP World in\nmanaging and operating dozens of ports around Europe, Asia and Africa? Do you expect international financial\nmarkets are pleased with Dubai Financial Market’s success in its accusation of some of the world’s most\nimportant financial markets in the world?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024943",
