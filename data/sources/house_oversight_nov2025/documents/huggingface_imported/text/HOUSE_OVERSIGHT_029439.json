Generally, wage earners from\nno-tax states... could see tax savings under the Act. For instance, a Florida taxpayer earning $1 million with\nmoderate itemized deductions may see a tax savings of about $30,000 under the Act. A similar taxpayer in New\nYork State may see a savings of about $3,500 according to our preliminary analysis..©\n\nConversely, very high-wage earners from high-tax states could see a higher tax bill. A taxpayer earning $3 million\nin New York City may see a significant tax increase: $44,000 under the Act, due in part to the loss of significant\ndeductions. A similar taxpayer in Florida would see a tax savings of about $91,000 under the Act (primarily due\nto the lower top rate, elongated 35% tax bracket and regaining itemized deductions that are no longer phased-\nout), according to our preliminary analysis.\n\nMarried couples could fare worse than two single taxpayers with a similar amount of income. The so-called\nmarriage penalty hits particularly hard under the new tax brackets. The penalty is also exacerbated by permitting\nmarried couples only a $10,000 state income/real estate tax deduction, but allowing each of two single filers a\ndeduction in the same amount ($20,000 combined).
