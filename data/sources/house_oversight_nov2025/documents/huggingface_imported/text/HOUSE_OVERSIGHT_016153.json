We note however, the Saudi Earnings\nRevision Ratio (ERR) has reached an inflection point, with a slowdown in the rate of\nearnings downgrades. (ERR is a ratio of number of companies enjoying earnings\nupgrades vs number of companies suffering downgrades. A ratio above one, therefore,\nindicates more upgrades than downgrades). Consequently, we believe the relatively un-\ntesting valuations of the Saudi market indicate that a high level of negativity is already\nbeing priced in.\n\nMSCI Saudi 12m Fwd EV-EBITDA\n16 7 —seeeqeeee Average\n\n06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n\nSource: DataStream, I/B/E/S, Bloomberg, BofA Merrill Lynch Global\nResearch\n\nOS Merrill Lynch\n\nGEMs Paper #26|30 June 2016 43\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016153",
