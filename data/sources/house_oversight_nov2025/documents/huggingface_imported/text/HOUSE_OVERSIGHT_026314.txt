Steve Bannon trying to get on disgraced
Jeffrey Epstein’s good side

By Emily Smith

Steve Bannon shared a secret meeting with reviled billionaire pedophile Jeffrey -Epstein

at the financier’s notorious Upper East Side mansion.

Former White House chief strategist Bannon was spotted stepping out of his SUV and
entering the registered sex offender’s sprawling 21,000-square-foot mansion at 9 E. 71st
St. shortly before 7 a.m. Wednesday.

Epstein’s -palatial pad is one of his homes where young girls were allegedly brought in to

perform massages and used as “‘sex slaves.”
We assume Bannon wasn’t there for a massage.

Sources speculate that the disgraced -Epstein wants to use his millions to work his way

close to political power again.
