(Epstein’s advantage here, over traditional investment firms, is\nthat he was proposing to do this without needing to own the algorithm itself,\nthe manner in which many firms operate to the disadvantage of the quants.) I\nknew paltry little about this and so rather found myself identifying with the\nyoung women to whom Epstein was explaining the basic math and\nmechanics. (Epstein demands a certain amount of pedagogical attention in\nreturn for a wealth of information.)\n\nHefnerian prurience becomes quite businesslike: poised young women\nin a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office responsibilities—\nreally not that different from any of the art galleries in the surrounding\nneighborhood.\n\nThe Epstein house/office is, not unlike many nearby galleries, an\nultimate club, a private reserve, a place of shared and valuable\ninformation—indeed, the kind of place, that, even for the most ardent\nconspiracists, might seem a little too movie-like.
