  "text": "—JULY 11,2007\n\nThe Choice-Minimal Lifestyle: 6 Formulas for More Output and\nLess Overwhelm\n\nI was stressed out... over dog cartoons.\n\nIt was 9:47 P.M. at Barnes and Noble on a recent Saturday night, and I had 13 minutes to find a\nsuitable exchange for The New Yorker Dog Cartoons, $22 of expensive paper. Bestsellers? Staff\nrecommends? New arrivals or classics? I'd already been there 30 minutes.\n\nBeginning to feel overwhelmed with a ridiculous errand I’d expected to take five minutes, I stumbled\nacross the psychology section. One tome jumped out at me as all too appropriate—The Paradox of\nChoice: Why More Is Less. It wasn’t the first time I’d seen or read Barry Schwartz’s 2004 classic, but it\nseemed like a good time to revisit the principles, among them, that:\n\ne+ The more options you consider, the more buyer’s regret you'll\nhave.\n\ne » The more options you encounter, the less fulfilling your ultimate\noutcome will be.\n\nThis raises a difficult question: Is it better to have the best outcome but be less satisfied, or have an\nacceptable outcome and be satisfied?\n\nFor example, would you rather deliberate for months and get the 1 of 20 houses that’s the best\ninvestment but second-guess yourself until you sell it five years later, or would you rather get a house\nthat is 80% of the investment potential of the former (still to be sold at a profit) but never second-guess\nit?\n\nTough call.\n\nSchwartz also recommends making nonreturnable purchases. I decided to keep the stupid pooch\ncartoons. Why? Because it’s not just about being satisfied, it’s about being practical.\n\nIncome is renewable, but some other resources—like attention—are not. [I’ve talked before about\nattention as a currency and how it determines the value of time.\n\nFor example: Is your weekend really free if you find a crisis in the inbox Saturday morning that you\ncan’t address until Monday morning?\n\nEven if the inbox scan lasts 30 seconds, the preoccupation and forward projection for the subsequent\n48 hours effectively deletes that experience from your life. You had time but you didn’t have attention,\nso the time had no practical value.\n\nThe choice-minimal lifestyle becomes an attractive tool when we consider two truths.\n\n1. Considering options costs attention that then can’t be spent on action or present-state\nawareness.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013999",
