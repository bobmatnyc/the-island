  "text": "reduction in the dynamical entropy of a system can occur is by reducing the number\nof its available states. As the repertoire of ways of personal responding, log Q, is\nreduced, so is the brain system’s entropy, S.\n\nReality constrained patterns of behavior, as in successfully adaptive\npersonalities, lie in some optimal in-between place between the maximal and\nminimum measures of entropy. The dynamical state that is postulated to yield in-\nbetween-valued entropies is called nonuniform hyperbolicity. This is best seen when\nthe values of the experimental observations are plotted in a two dimensional phase\nspace with each point represented by two values: along the x-axis is plotted the\nvalue observed, along the y-axis is graphed the change in the value from the last\nobservation. The signatory motions of these observations plotted in phase space\nare irregularly varying in rate of expansion (near by initial values are separating in\ntime) and contraction (greatly differing initial values are coming together in time).\nValues are not fixed, rhythmically varying nor in random motion. These\nnonuniformly hyperbolic motions are seen in speeded up, talking head videos\nshowing bursts of hand gestures and in normal neuronal activity. Silences have\nwidely varying lengths and bursts of hand movements and neuronal discharges are\nirregular in duration and character. The statistical pattern of neuronal inter-burst\nintervals is not the convergent Gaussian distribution of |.Q. or heights but the\nnonconvergent, long tailed, Levy distribution of flood incidences and, according to\nMandelbrot, stock market crashes.\n\nThe labored logic and inscrutably compact mathematical formalisms of the\nNobel Prize winning physicist, Ilya Prigogine, and his Belgian school, explain the\nthermodynamics of these long lasting niches of restricted variation in our personal\nstyle as energy requiring dissipative structures. Compulsive nail biting, driven\npromiscuity, readiness to be suspicious are seen as a persistence of deviations\nfrom the maximum entropy of formless, flexible, receptive end states. The system is\ntrapped in possibility reduced, energy requiring, samsaric niches of what Prigogine\ncalled minimal entropy generation. We unique and oddly shaped and entropy\n\nleaking balloons maintain our characteristic distortions through energy-requiring,\n\n31\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013531",
