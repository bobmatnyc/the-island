On a short-term basis, however, US exposure to China is limited with merchandise exports,\ncorporate profits and foreign claims at about 1% of GDP. As seen in Exhibit 7, the Chinese equity\nmarkets have also deteriorated much more significantly than US markets in 2018.\n\nOf course, specific stocks with greater exposure to China through higher sales have underperformed\nthe S&P 500 by about 6% since the latest tariffs were imposed on $200bn of Chinese products, as\nshown in Exhibit 8.\n\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026901",
