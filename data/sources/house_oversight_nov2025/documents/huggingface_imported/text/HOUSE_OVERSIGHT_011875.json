Olmert briefed the\ncabinet, and secured the ministers’ approval to destroy the reactor, with the\nunderstanding that the precise timing of the operation would now be left to the\nPrime Minister, the Defense Minister and the Foreign Minister: Olmert, me and\nTzipi Livni. The three of us met immediately after the cabinet discussion. Olmert\nargued that the risk of leaks justified attacking that night, and I agreed with him.\nTzipi was reluctant, but Olmert turned to her and said: “Are you sure you’re\ncomfortable with an attack being ordered by me and Barak, while you chose to\nabstain?” She thought it over, and added her approval.\n\nWe struck just after midnight, in an intricately coordinated air attack that\nevaded not only a Syrian response, but Syrian notice. The reactor was destroyed.\nAlthough even today the exact details remain subject to Israel’s military secrecy\nregulations, accounts published abroad in the weeks and months that followed\npainted a surprisingly accurate picture, including the pioneering use of electronic\nwarfare capabilities to deal with risk of radar detection. But in the immediate\naftermath of the attack, Israel deliberately made no public comment. We refused to\nsay whether we’d had anything to do with an attack.

But in the\nspring of 2008, it became known that the Israeli police were investigating Olmert’s\nrelationship with an American businessman named Moshe Talansky. The\nsuggestion, initially in a New York paper and then the Israeli press, was that\nOlmert was guilty of taking bribes. In his first public response, he didn’t deny\n\n404\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011875",
