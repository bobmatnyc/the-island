  "text": "Every businessman knows this; that is why the \"loss leader” or the giveaway is such a\npowerful marketing tool. Obama's America is one in which free stuff is given away: the adults\namong the 47,000,000 on food stamps clearly recognized for whom they should vote, and so\nthey did, by the tens of millions; those who - courtesy of Obama - receive two full years of\nunemployment benefits (which, of course, both disincentivizes looking for work and also\nmotivates people to work ot the books while collecting their windfall) surely know for whom\nto vote. The lure of free stuff is irresistik\n\nThe defining moment of the whole campaign was the revelation of the secretly-recorded video\nin which Romney acknowledged the difficulty of winning an election in which \"47% of the\npeople\" start off against him because they pay no taxes and just receive money - \"free stuff\" -\nfrom the government.\n\nhalf of the population has n¢ ie game - they\ndon't care about high t taxes, promoting b business, or creating\njobs, nor do they care that the money for their free stuff is\nbeing borrowed from their children and from the Chinese.\n\nThey just want the free stuff that comes their way at someone\nelse's expense. In the end, that 47% leaves very little margin\nfor error for any Republican, and does not bode well for the\nfuture.\n\nodds. - People do vote their pocketbooks.

Indeed, it does not pay to be an informed voter,\nbecause most other voters - the clear majority — are unintelligent and easily swayed by\nemotion and raw populism. That is the indelicate way of saying that too many people vote\nwith their hearts and not their heads. That is why Obama did not have to produce a second\nterm agenda, or even defend his first-term record. He needed only to portray Mitt Romney as\na rapacious capitalist who throws elderly women over a cliff, when he is not just snatching\naway their cancer medication, while starving the poor and cutting taxes for the rich.\n\nDuring his 1956 presidential campaign, a woman called out to Adlai Stevenson: \"Senator, you\nhave the vote of every thinking person!\" Stevenson called back: \"That's not enough, madam,\nwe need a majority!\"\n\nTruer words were never spoken.\n\nObama could get away with saying that \"Romney wants the rich to play by a different set of\nrules\" - without ever defining what those different rules were; with saying that the \"rich\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031701",
