  "text": "I wrote back:\n\nI think it's adorable that you told me the vow thing by text- & on a serious note, I rather\nadmire you for challenging yourself & social expectations of masculinity. I can't afford\nexegesis of my sexual history by text; we can talk about it when you visit- which I hope\nyou do, even if you insist on sleeping on the floor. I promise not to push you- though I\nconfess I'm curious about the vow's limits. But I also understand if you don't feel\ncomfortable coming down.\n\nHis relief, in our next few exchanges, was palpable. I think a man who wants to abstain\nhas a far trickier journey ahead of him than a woman: America's sexual assumptions may\nbe formed around stereotypical male sexuality -- which really sucks for women -- but it's\na very narrow stereotype that limits men too. Men are expected to be insatiable, and\npreferring not to have sex casts a man's entire masculinity into question. His abstinence\ncan cause anxiety for the female partner, too: after all, given an assumption that men are\nnigh-indiscriminate sex machines, a woman might feel that there's something terribly\nwrong with her if a man won't bang her.\n\nMr. Chastity has dealt with those problems a lot, so my careful reaction and evident lack\nof anxiety won me lots of points. Since then, I've met up with him publicly twice, and\nwe've even managed to make out! He's still going to visit. Maybe I can convince him to\nsleep in bed, as long as I promise not to put the moves on him.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, his vow allows him to practice BDSM... a girl can dream, right?\nBut seriously, if we can do BDSM together, then I just might be his dream partner. I'd be\nhappy to focus our sexual time on BDSM and foreplay, and to ignore \"actual\" sex\nindefinitely. Plus, some people argue that declining to sate ourselves sexually is the best\ntactic for prolonging romantic magic. So this could be the way for Mr. Chastity to\nbecome the love of my life.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nIn Africa, the mantra for HIV educators is ABC: the three things that protect against HIV/\nAIDS are Abstinence, Being faithful, and Condom usage. But my job is much more\ncomplicated than passing out condoms and wagging my finger. The problem isn't so\nmuch that people don't know how to avoid HIV, although myths and misconceptions do\nexist. The problem is that people don't seem willing to change their behavior in order to\nprotect themselves... or that they don't feel they have the power to change their behavior.\n\nPeople can't just know about condoms -- they must prioritize condom usage despite\ndrawbacks like loss of pleasure or pressure from their partners. People can't just know\nthat HIV is sexually transmitted -- they must be psychologically open to abstaining from\nsex despite drawbacks that are, well, obvious. HIV prevention in Africa is less about\nsharing knowledge, now, and more about marketing: giving people a new perspective on\nsex, their health, and their futures.\n\nOf course, I'm totally psyched about marketing some of these social aspects, like gender\nequality. (Gender equality is an HIV/AIDS issue for lots of reasons -- the most obvious\nbeing that the less power women have, the less they control their own sexual acts.) But\nothers give me pause. Abstinence? Seriously? It sticks in my craw. Obviously, I don't\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018583",
