  "text": "In civil cases, a company may similarly be required\nto retain an independent compliance consultant or moni-\ntor to provide an independent, third-party review of the\ncompany’s internal controls. The consultant recommends\nimprovements, to the extent necessary, which the company\nmust adopt. When both DOJ and SEC require a com-\npany to retain a monitor, the two agencies have been able\nto coordinate their requirements so that the company can\nretain one monitor to fulfill both sets of requirements.\n\nThe most successful monitoring relationships are\nthose in which the company embraces the monitor or con-\nsultant. If the company takes the recommendations and\nsuggestions seriously and uses the monitoring period as a\ntime to find and fix any outstanding compliance issues, the\ncompany can emerge from the monitorship with a stronger,\n\nlong-lasting compliance program.\n\nFCPA Penalties,\nSanctions, and\nRemedies\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022574",
