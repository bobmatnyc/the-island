Globally, we\nestimate that the legal cannabis market has the potential to reach $500 billion annually, approaching\none billion consumers.\n\nThe Global Legal Cannabis Market\n\nCannabis legalization is gaining momentum around the world. This momentum is driven primarily by\nthe increasing recognition that cannabis may have a range of legitimate medicinal benefits and thera-\npeutic applications. At least 20 countries now have medical laws that facilitate patient access to can-\nnabis or cannabis concentrates for treating specified medical conditions. Notable countries with such\nmedical laws include Australia, Canada, Colombia and Germany; countries without such laws include\nChina, Japan, Russia and the United States. (Contrary to U.S. federal law, 29 states, encompassing\n62% of the U.S. population, permit the production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use\nin treating a broad range of qualifying medical conditions.) While the merits of medical cannabis are\ncurrently driving legalization, we believe that—like Uruguay and numerous U.S. states—other coun-\ntries will ultimately enact legislation permitting the production, sale and use of recreational cannabis.\n(Canada is widely expected to do so in mid-2018.)\n\nThe following world map illustrates select countries that (i) have enacted medical laws that facilitate\npatient access to cannabis or concentrates for treating specified medical conditions, (ii) have enacted\nrecreational laws that permit the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational\nand other uses, or (iii) include a state or province that has a cannabis law or policy in conflict with\nfederal law.\n\nSelect Countries with Legalized Cannabis Access (January 2018)\n\n&\n\nGE Recreational Law* <\nES Medical Law\n\n( State/Province Conflict\nwith Federal Law\n\n*Canada currently has a medical law.
