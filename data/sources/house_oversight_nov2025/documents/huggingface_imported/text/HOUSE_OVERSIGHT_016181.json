  "text": "authorities have highlighted in several press releases that Aramco and SABIC are looking\nat potential oil-to-olefins projects. The Kingdom has a proprietary technology that\nenables it to maximise the yield of olefins per ton of oil used. According to SABIC's\nmanagement, this project has been carried out on a small scale at test sites and it is\nconducting feasibility studies at a larger-scale facility. Aramco has also highlighted plans\nin this area. While both companies declined to comment, Bloomberg highlighted that\nsources indicate they are assessing the possibility of embarking on a project together.\nSuch a step would be the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia, with Aramco and SABIC\n\nworking alongside each other on such a large scale.\n\nRefining capacity target: almost there\nThe NTP aims to increase the refining capacity to 3.3mn bpd per day by 2020 from\n2.9mn bpd today. Saudi has recently completed and launched two large refining projects\nwith 400kbpd installed refining capacity each: (1) SATORP in Jubail launched in June\n2014; and (2) YASREF in Yanbu — first shipment made in January 2015 and inaugurated\nin January 2016. In addition, it is building a new refinery, Jazan, which should process\n400kb/d of Arabian heavy and medium crude oil; launch is expected in 2019.\n\nTable 26: Saudi Arabia government refining assets\n\nName Location Completion Refining Saudi Aramco's Saudi Aramco's Partner\ncapacity, kb/d share in capacity, kb/d ownership (%)\n\nWholly-owned domestic refineries\nJeddah Jeddah 1967 90 90 100% nla\nYanbu Yanbu 1979 240 240 100% nla\nRiyadh Riyadh 1981 126 126 100% nla\nRas Tanura Ras Tanura 1986 550 550 100% nla\nTotal 1,006 1,006\nDomestic refining JVs:\nSAMREF Yanbu 1983 400 150 50.0% ExxonMobil\nSASREF Jubail 1986 305 114 50.0% Shell\nPetro Rabigh | Rabigh 1990 400 150 37.5% Sumitomo (37.5%, free float 25%)\nSATORP Jubail 2014 400 250 62.5% Total (37.5%)\nYASREF Yanbu 2015 400 250 62.5% Sinopec (37.5%)\nTotal 1905 914\nTotal in Saudi Arabia 2,911 1,920\nInternational refining JVs:\nS-Oil South Korea 1991 669 424 63.4% S-Oil\nMotiva USA 2002 1070 535 50.0% Shell\nShowa Shell Japan 2004 445 67 15.0% Shell\nFujian China 2007 280 70 25.0% Sinopec, ExxonMobil\nTotal 2464 1096\nTotal capacity globally 5,375 3,016\nSource: Saudi Aramco, Energy Policy, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nTable 27: Saudi Arabia petroleum product output in 2014 (mn bpd)\n\nSaudi Aramco LPG Naphtha Gasoline Jet Fuel _ Diesel Fuel oil Asphalt Total\n\nownership (%)\n\nWholly-owned domestic refineries\nJeddah 100% 0.9 2.9 4.0 0.0 24 9.2 6.4 25.8\nYanbu 100% 24 3:2 11.5 -0.4 29.3 30.9 0.0 77.0\nRiyadh 100% 1.8 0.0 10.9 27 19.2 0.0 6.5 41.2\nRas Tanura 100% 5.0 15.0 43.9 78 76.1 32.5 7.2 ~~ 187.4\nSubtotal 10.1 21.1 70.3 10.0 127.1 72.6 20.1 331.3\nSaudi Aramco share in domestic JVs\nSAMREF 50% 1.1 0.0 25.0 11.1 18.8 14.4 0.0 68.2\nSASREF 50% 13 11.7 2.2 9.4 14.2 13.3 0.0 52.2\nPetro Rabigh 38% 1.3 13 6.9 49 11.7 13.4 0.0 45.5\nSATORP 63% 13 3.9 WA 8.2 31.6 18 0.0 63.7\nSubtotal 2.9 22.9 45.2 33.7 76.3 48.6 0.0 229.5\nTotal 13.0 44.0 115.6 43.7 203.4 121.2 20.1 560.9\nSource: Saudi Aramco, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nOS erartll Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 71\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016181",
