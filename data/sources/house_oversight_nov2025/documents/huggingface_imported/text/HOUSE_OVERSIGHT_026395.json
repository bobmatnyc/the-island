  "text": "KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans inoculated ourselves very\nthoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider it.\n\nI rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series \"The Man in the High Castle\", which explores\nwhat would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as a\nbrutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not a\nflat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book \"Starship Troopers\" explores fascism, too,\nbut unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order.\n\nI find your \"political incorrectness\" very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly signaling,\nbut now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in your youth?\nDid you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person you want to\ntransform into.\n\nIt was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything\nremotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether \"democracy still\nworks\", and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others,\nhard in oneself. A speaker felt that the media \"stifle all criticism of Trump\", another wanted to remove \"men\nand Elon Musk from government\", and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere.\n\nI noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, insight-\nladen topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience with\nsymbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates with them. The non-\ncontroversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while rarely\noffending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance).\n\nHe also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for him.\nThis invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very few of\nhis ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from others.\n\nI am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. Joi is\nright. Public communication is about reaching one's goals.\n\nBests,\n\nJoscha\n\nOn Sun, Jul 10, 2016 at 12:42 AM, Joscha Bach <q wrote:\n\nDear Jeffrey,\n\nthank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail.\n\nSorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive when\nI get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam (who was as\nalways very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not feel like\nconceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that humans have\nvery specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other ideas), and his\nfrustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026395",
