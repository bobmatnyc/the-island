  "text": "90 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\n\nthat the mere filing of a complaint does not start a Sixth Amendment\nprosecution also make clear that a later court hearing would start such a\nprosecution. For instance, in the Fourth Circuit case cited by OLC, United\nStates v. Alvarado, the court reasons that “the main reason a law\nenforcement officer files [] a complaint is to establish probable cause for an\narrest warrant. The criminal process is still in the investigative stage, and\nthe adverse positions of government and defendant have yet to solidify.”!”\nRelying on that reasoning, the Fourth Circuit refused to find that the nght to\ncounsel had attached merely because a police officer had filed a complaint\nto get an arrest warrant. But the Fourth Circuit distinguished that situation\nfrom “the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings against the\ndefendant.”’”? An initial appearance would be such an adversary\nproceeding—1.e., it would be a “prosecution” under the Sixth Amendment.\nIn light of this, OLC’s position that the CVRA’s venue provision’s “no-\nprosecution-underway” reference covers proceedings, such as an initial\nappearance, does not work.\n\nThe only sensible way to construe the CVRA’s venue provision is to\nread it as conveniently dividing criminal cases into two phases: a\nprosecution phase and an earlier investigative phase when “no prosecution\nis under way.”'*° Senator Kyl, for instance, has noted that if there are any\ndoubts about how to construe the CVRA, this venue provision “sweeps\nthem away.”!8' Once again, the language that Congress used leads\ninexorably to the conclusion that the CVRA extends rights to victims before\nthe filing of criminal charges.\n\nTV. WHEN PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS ATTACH UNDER THE CVRA\n\nThe zeal with which OLC argues against applying CVRA rights before\ncharging raises the question of why it protests so much. Although OLC\nnever articulated this concern, perhaps OLC worried that pre-charging\nrights would be difficult to administer. Such concerns should evaporate\nwith a workable construction of when pre-charging rights attach. In this\nPart, we propose such a construction, suggesting that CVRA rights should\nattach when substantial evidence exists that a specific person has been\ndirectly and proximately harmed as the result of a federal crime. This\napproach appears to already be the method that the Department is taking, as\n\nthis document is used for multiple purposes.”); see also Felder v.
