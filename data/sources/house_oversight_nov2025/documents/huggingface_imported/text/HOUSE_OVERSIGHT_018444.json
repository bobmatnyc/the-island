  "text": "welcome-to-kink-research. html\n\nIn 2012, Bitch Magazine ran a series called \"Thinking Kink\" by Catherine Scott, which\nexamines S&M and culture from a feminist perspective:\nhttp://www.allthatchas.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/all-of-my-thinking-kink-posts-for-\n\nbitch. html\nIn Person\n\nIf you've decided that you want to start attending workshops, discussion groups, parties,\nor other BDSM events in person, please keep in mind that not everyone is going to mesh\nwell with their local BDSM groups. If you don't like your local BDSM group, then don't\nforce yourself to participate! That said, I generally encourage people to get into their\nlocal community, because it truly can be an amazing resource -- it's way more than just a\nplace to meet partners.\n\nIf you make an account on FetLife, you may be able to join groups for your area (for\nexample, if you live in Chicago, then you should look for Chicago groups), where local\nissues or events will be discussed and publicized.\n\nFor those aged 18-35, many major cities have branches of The Next Generation, a.k.a. the\nlocal \"kinky youth group.”\n\nOtherwise, just Google around. It's much easier these days than it was for our parents.\nok ook\n\nThis resource list can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/bdsm-resources/\n\nTable of Contents\n\nKK Ok\n\nHere's a link to go back to The Very Beginning.\nAnd here's a link to the Glossary.\n\nThroughout this book, footnotes will look like links in the text. Click the link to go to the\nfootnote. At the end of each footnote I've included a backlink to the context you came\nfrom.\n\nI write both personal narratives and cultural analysis. Almost all my writing mixes the\ntwo, but most of my pieces incline more towards one than the other. Accordingly, I've\ntagged all the articles in this book as either [storytime] or [theory].\n\nte ok ok\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018444",
