  "text": "Netanyahu originally planned to come to Washington with a\ngenerous peace proposal to entice the Palestinians back to the\nnegotiating table. But Obama painted him into a corner and made him\nchange his script by notifying him, as he was about to board his\nplane, that the President was going to call for Israel to return to its\n1949-1967 lines, without also calling for the Palestinians to give up\ntheir right of return. By thus preempting the prime minister, he forced\nhim to become more defensive of Israel's bargaining positions and\nless willing to offer specific, generous concessions. The result was a\npowerful speech in defense of Israel by Netanyahu, an\noverwhelmingly positive response from Congress and a movement\naway from peace negotiations.\n\nAll in all, the President's well-intentioned efforts to jump-start the\npeace process have backfired, not so much because he favors one side\nover the other, but because of the ham-handedness of his negotiation\nstrategy. A negotiator or mediator whose statements move the parties\nfurther away from the negotiating table than they were before he\nspoke deserves a failing grade in the science of negotiation.\n\nWhat the President should have done is to insist that both parties\nimmediately agree to sit down and negotiate without any\npreconditions.\n\nIt's not too late. But it will take yet another \"explanation\" of what\nPresident Obama really meant in his ill-advised speech.\n\nDershowitz's most recent novel is \"The Trials of Zion.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030274",
