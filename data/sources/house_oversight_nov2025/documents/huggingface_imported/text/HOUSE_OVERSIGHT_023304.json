I was not\nshown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called\"\nadvisors \" however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get\nto spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the\nlist I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your\noffice still remains virtually undone.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023304",
