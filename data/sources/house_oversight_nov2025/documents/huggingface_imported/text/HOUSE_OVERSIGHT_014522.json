It is our view that due to fiscal and political pressure to keep future budget deficits in check and the\nnarrow corridor which could result in the passage of a major tax bill (Reconciliation), we expect the tax bill to be\ncloser to the House Republicans’ Plan than the Trump Plan and perhaps narrower in scope. When more\ninformation is available, we expect to issue a more detailed Tax Alert.\n\n— National Wealth Planning Strategies\n\nIMPORTANT: This publication is designed to provide general information about ideas and strategies.
