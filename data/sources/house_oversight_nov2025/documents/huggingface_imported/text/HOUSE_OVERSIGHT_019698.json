  "text": "210 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nThe question was considered by the NSA’s National Threat Oper-\nations Center, the same unit from which Edward Snowden later\nstole a huge trove of secret documents. According to a report in 1996\ntitled “Out of Control” (later released by the NSA), the danger of\nan Ames-type penetration could not be excluded. Even though the\n“threat officer” who wrote this report was not identified by name,\nhis analysis proved incredibly prescient. He said that the NSA’s drive\nto enhance its performance by networking its computers would\nresult in the intelligence services’ putting “all their classified infor-\nmation ‘eggs’ into one very precarious basket.” The basket was the\ncomputer networks run by technicians called system administrators.\nHe pointed out that the NSA was becoming increasingly dependent\non such networked computer systems, and he predicted that the\nNSA’s “Aldrich Ames,” as he put it, would be a “system administra-\ntor,” which was the position that Edward Snowden held nearly two\ndecades later at Dell when he began stealing secrets.\n\nThe NSA‘s system administrators were, as the threat officer\npointed out, very different from the traditional military employees\n\n© at the NSA. They were usually civilians who effectively served as ©\nrepairmen for complex computer systems. Moreover, many of them\nhad not been directly hired by the NSA. Instead, their recruitment\nhad been privatized to outside contractors.\n\nThis outsourcing had deep roots tracing back to World War II. Ed\nBooz and Jim Allen, the founders of Booz Allen Hamilton, obtained\ncontracts to help manage ship construction from the U.S. Navy.\nAfter the war ended, they sought contracts for their firm in clas-\nsified work. These contracts grew in size as the NSA needed more\nand more system administrators and other information technolo-\ngists to manage the computer networks. These system administra-\ntors needed to be given special privileges to do their service job. One\nsuch privilege allowed them to bypass password protection. Another\nprivilege allowed then to temporarily transfer data to an external\nstorage device while they repaired computers. These two privileges\ngreatly increased the risk of a massive breach. Seeing them as the\nweak link in the chain, the threat officer wrote in the report that\n“system administrators are likely to be increasingly targeted by for-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 210 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019698",
