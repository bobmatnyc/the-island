  "text": "There was silence, a grave look from Peled and Bren, the hint of a smile on\nMotta’s face, and the meeting was over. Several days later, I was notified of his\nverdict. I would indeed be named the commander of the 401st Armored Brigade\nin the Sinai, and promoted to full colonel.\n\nOur base was a 15 miles from the canal. It was a huge expanse of sand\nringed by metal fencing. We spent three months at a time in this forward\ndeployment and three months in our rear base, 50 miles from the canal. During\none of our forward deployments, Motta came on an inspection visit. He wanted\nto discuss how we planned defend the area near the canal in the event of a\nrepeat of the 1973 war. I told him everything we were doing in the brigade was\naimed at ensuring flexibility. I had also been thinking about some of the broader\nissues relating to our defenses in the south. ““No matter how good our tactics or\nplans,” I said, “what worries me is that we’re szil/ not looking at our overall\napproach to defense against Egypt. It’s as if we’ve forgotten that in 1967, when\nwe captured Sinai, it was in order to have a buffer zone. We had /50 miles of\nsand between southern Israel and the canal. But when the Egyptians attacked in\n1973, we defended the desert as if it was the walls of Jerusalem!”\n\nSince the 401st was one of two regular brigades on the Egyptian front, it was\nnot easy to make the four-hour drive home to Ramat Hasharon. When I got\nword Nava was going into labor with our second child, I was leading a training\nexercise five or six miles from our base. As she was on her way to the hospital,\nI grabbed my car and headed north. Unlike Michal’s birth, this one was not\neasy. When the baby emerged, she was struggling to breathe. The immediate\ndanger passed, but she was placed in an incubator. When I got to the hospital,\nNava was asleep. I was taken to see our tiny daughter, Yael. When the nurse\nleft, I noticed the baby’s pinkie trapped in the plastic cover of the incubator. I\nstarted banging on the window of the room. The nurse rushed back. With a look\nof sympathy mixed with world-weary experience of other fathers in similar\npanic, she raised the cover, folded Yael’s tiny hands onto her stomach, and all\nwas well.\n\nIt was another health crisis which hastened the end of my period as brigade\ncommander. But this time, I was the one in the hospital. I nearly collapsed from\nhigh fever and exhaustion. The initial suspicion was some kind of\ncontamination linked to the rudimentary sanitation in the Sinai. When the\nsymptoms persisted, the doctors suggested I probably had hepatitis B. Years\nlater, better diagnostic tools ruled all that out. I’ve never discovered what the\n\n161\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011632",
