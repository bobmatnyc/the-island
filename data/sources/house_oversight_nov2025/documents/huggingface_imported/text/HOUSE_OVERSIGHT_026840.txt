The Fusion of Civilizations

The Case for Global Optimism

Foreign Affairs
May/June 2016 issue
By Kishore Mahbubani and Lawrence H. Summers

The mood of much of the world is grim these days. Turmoil in the Middle
East, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees;
random terrorist attacks across the globe; geopolitical tensions in eastern
Europe and Asia; the end of the commodity supercycle; slowing growth in
China; and economic stagnation in many countries-all have combined to
feed a deep pessimism about the present and, worse, the future.

Historians looking back on this age from the vantage point of later
generations, however, are likely to be puzzled by the widespread
contemporary feelings of gloom and doom. By most objective measures of
human well-being, the past three decades have been the best in history.
More and more people in more and more places are enjoying better lives
