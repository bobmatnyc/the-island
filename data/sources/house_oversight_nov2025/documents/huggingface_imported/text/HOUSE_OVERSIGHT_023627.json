  "text": "Date: Saturday, October 8 2016 08:05 PM\nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>\nTo: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com>;\n\nIt’s an absurdly vast house, among the largest in Manhattan, but the dining room is grand but peaceful,\ncreating a hermetic or stop-time sense, broken only by the household staff ferrying in time-of-day-appropriate\nexotic foods and beverages.\n\nThe real world seems terribly far away, but with paparazzi often posted near by, it’s dangerously close too.\nOnce I arrived for a visit and found several police cars blocking the street and thought the worst—they’d come\nfor him . But it was a massive security detail for a well known head of state who had come for tea.\n\nWe met several years before he became arguably the world’s most notorious sex offender. In 2002, his plane, a\nmeticulously appointed 727, ferried a group of people to the TED conference in Monterey. He was the\nmysterious and peculiarly gracious host arriving after everyone had boarded: tanned, relaxed, attentive,\nsoliciting every guest’s story and views, and accompanied by three young women not his daughters, witty,\npoised, helpful, and beautiful—out of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe life.\n\nOne more thing about this trip suggesting something of his unique view of the public world and what you got to\nsee when you are near him. Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, with their company rising into the\nstratosphere, came out to see his plane on the Monterey tarmac and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran\nwhooping from one end of the plane to the other. Then, sitting in the plane’s plush living room, they described,\nin what I could not be sure was a put-on or entrepreneurial brainstorm, the future of search ..\n\nSince that trip, and through his travails, I have often been invited to his house to participate in the conversations\nof the newest ideas that often take place there.\n\nIn sweatshirt, draw-string pants, palm beach slippers, and half glasses, Jeffrey Epstein—that Epstein, most\nrecently embroiled in charges involved under age women ,Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew—spends most\nof his day at his dining room table in the in front of a laptop and beside a row of reading glasses (there are a lot\nof them in case, apparently, he misplaces a pair, but being quite meticulous he never does) conducting what\nmust surely be the world’s most extraordinary colloquial. Pictures on the table have Jeffrey and prime minister,\nprinces, leading scientists.with fidel castro next to the photo with pope, I guess his attempt at levity.\n\nThese meetings, and this lifestyle, have somehow stayed private or secret—or apart—not out of any formal or\nstated restrictions, but because, in some sense, it would be very hard to explain just what you’re doing there\nwith a well known sex offender ina mouth dropping home flaunting all moderation.\n\nAnd yet, defying controversy , and tolerating his societal tone deafness—or shy attitude toward the\nzeitgeist—still so many come. Gladly. Willingly. Feeling that his invitation is frankly quite an extraordinary\nprivilege.\n\nAmong his frequent guests is Bill Gates, for whom Epstein has become a friend, proposing a way to leverage\nthe resources of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to accommodate many other fortunes, so that, Epstein\nexplains, “you might join 10 or 20 billionaires on one giving project.” They can leverage your unique\nexperience and expertise in the philanthropic world and learn from your early mistakes.\nAs part of a many friends encouraged effort to get “out in front” of the notice that might be expected when it\nwas revealed the number and wide diversity of the most rarified thinkers of our generation that come to visit .\nEpstein agreed to a limited on-the-record conversation with me.\n\nHis subject, on a morning in late fall, sitting at the dining room table—its humorous but baronial quality\ndisturbed by an ever-present white board—is “hyper wealth.” His subject is always wealth—how capital , in\nuber amounts should react to the given new global political, economic, and cultural moment.\n\nHis stock in trade is not the making of money, (his proletariat background not withstanding ) but the issues that\narise when wealth growing at a heretofore unimaginable rate, makes its entrance , altering many basic\neconomic, social, and personal calculations. Watching his presentation recounts a math class of the mighty.\n\nThe professor at the blackboard and the students ( the titans ), still hoping they are not called upon to answer a\ndifficult question.\n\nHe recounts a dinner he had two nights before. The scene is, like much of what he does, a conspiracy theorist’s\nfantasy—the six men at this dinner, all technology entrepreneurs, representing, together, over a hundred billion\ndollars and now trying to figure out how to use their resources in order to help shape the world.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023627",
