  "text": "MOSHE SAFDIE\n\nMoshe Safdie is an architect, urban planner, educator,\ntheorist, and author. Embracing a comprehensive and\nhumane design philosophy, Safdie is committed to\narchitecture that supports and enhances a project’s\nprogram; that is informed by the geographic, social, and\ncultural elements that define a place; and that responds to\nhuman needs and aspirations. Safdie has completed a wide\nrange of projects, such as cultural, educational, and civic\ninstitutions; neighborhoods and public parks; mixed-use\nurban centers and airports; and master plans for existing\ncommunities and entirely new cities around the world.\n\nMajor projects by Safdie Architects currently under\nconstruction or recently completed include Mamilla Alrov\nCenter, a dynamic urban center near the Old City in Jerusalem;\nMarina Bay Sands, a mixed-use integrated resort in Singapore;\nKhalsa Heritage Memorial Complex, the national museum\nof the Sikh people in the Punjab, India; the United States\nInstitute of Peace Headquarters on the Mall in Washington,\nD.C.; the National Campus for the Archeology of Israel in\n\nJerusalem; Golden Dream Bay, a high-density residential\nproject in Qinhuangdao, China; the Kauffman Center for the\nPerforming Arts in Kansas City, Missouri; and the Crystal\nBridges Museum of American Artin Bentonville, Arkansas.\n\nBorn in Haifa, Israel, in 1938, Safdie moved to\nCanada with his family at a young age. He graduated from\nMcGill University in 1961 with a degree in architecture.\nAfter apprenticing with Louis I. Kahn in Philadelphia, Safdie\nreturned to Montreal to oversee the master plan for the\n1967 World Exhibition. In 1964 he established his own firm\nto realize Habitat ’67, an adaptation of his thesis at McGill,\nwhich was the central feature of the World’s Fair and a\ngroundbreaking design in the history of architecture.\n\nIn 1970, Safdie established a Jerusalem branch office,\ncommencing an intense involvement with the rebuilding of\nJerusalem. He was responsible for major segments of the\nrestoration of the Old City and the reconstruction of the new\ncenter, linking the Old and New Cities. Over the years, his\ninvolvement expanded and included the new city of Modi’in,\n\nthe new Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, and the Rabin\nMemorial Center. During this period, Safdie also became\n\ninvolved in the developing world, working in Senegal, Iran,\nSingapore, and in the northern Canadian arctic. In 1978,\nafter teaching at Yale, McGill, and Ben Gurion Universities,\nSafdie relocated his residence and principal office to Boston.\nHe served as Director of the Urban Design Program at\nHarvard University Graduate School of Design from 1978 to\n1984, and Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban\nDesign from 1984 to 1989. In the following decade, he was\nresponsible for the design of six of Canada’s principal public\ninstitutions, including the Quebec Museum of Civilization, the\nNational Gallery of Canada, and Vancouver Library Square.\nSafdie has worked with a wide range of clients,\nincluding municipal entities and government agencies,\ncolleges and universities, private developers, and non-\nprofit organizations and civic institutions. Many of his\nfirm’s buildings have become beloved regional and\nnational landmarks, including Exploration Place Science\nCenter, Wichita, Kansas; Salt Lake City Public Library,\nSalt Lake City, Utah; Peabody Essex Museum, Salem,\nMassachusetts; Springfield Federal Courthouse, Springfield,\nMassachusetts; Skirball Cultural Center, Los Angeles,\nCalifornia; Lester B. Pearson International Airport,\nToronto, Canada; the National Gallery of Canada; and\nYad Vashem Holocaust Museum, Jerusalem, Israel.\nIn addition to numerous articles on the theory\nand practice of architecture, Safdie has written several\nbooks, most notably, Beyond Habitat (1970), For Everyone a\nGarden (1974), Form and Purpose (1982), and Jerusalem: The\nFuture of the Past (1989). The City After the Automobile (1997)\ndetails Safdie’s ideas about urbanism and city planning. A\ncomprehensive monograph of his work, Moshe Safdie I, was\npublished in 1996. Moshe Safdie II, a second monograph\nfeaturing work from 1996-2008, was published in 2009.\nSafdie has been featured in several films, including\nMoshe Safdie, The Power of Architecture, which is a portrait\nfilm (directed by Donald Winkler, 2004), My Architect: A\nSon’s Journey about Nathaniel Kahn and his father Louis\nI.
