  "text": "H (Distributed + Liquid Public) to Paid-in Capital: Calculated based on (1) called capital of a\nfund (based on individual called capital percentages and fund sizes across multiple funds)\nand (2) distributed capital of a fund (based on aggregating individual funds distributed\ncapital amounts, as calculated using DPI and called individual fund called amounts) plus the\nunrealized value of freely tradable publicly traded securities based on the closing market\nprice of the security. This is based on the assumption that NLV can trade out of 10% of daily\ntrading volume over next 30 days based on last 30 days ADTV.\n\nFor the purposes of this ratio for NLV-I and NLV-II, the “deemed contribution” of the general\npartner is included in the total amount of capital contributions made by the fund’s partners.\n\n' Realized Cost: Represents the cost of investment attributable to the realized portion of such\ninvestment.\n\nJ Total Cost: Represents the overall cost of investment.\n\nK Realized Value: Represents gross proceeds received from the sale of an underlying\ninvestment or group of investments.\n\n. Unrealized Value, Unrealized/(Public) or Unrealized/(Private): All private investments are\nfair value as determined in good faith by the General Partner.

The unrealized value of\npublicly traded securities held shown in parenthesis is valued at the closing market price.\nThe unrealized value of warrants for any publicly traded companies is valued based on the\nBlack-Sholes Method.\n\nM Total Value: Represents realized value plus Unrealized Value.\n\nN Multiple: Represents the ratio of Total Value, Realized Value or Unrealized Value to the\ncorresponding amount of capital invested, expressed as a multiple.\n\n99 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024110",
