July 16, 2003) (quoting Moss v.\nMorgan Stanley, Inc., 719 F.2d 5, 17 2d\nCir.1983)); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1962.\n“Civil RICO is an unusually potent weapon\n\n. ‘courts should strive to flush out frivo-\nlous RICO allegations at an early stage of\nthe litigation.’” Katzman v. Victoria’s Se-\ncret, 167 F.R.D. 649, 655 (S.D.N.Y.1996).\n\n[74] The Federal complaint asserts a\nRICO claim under § 1962(a), which states\nin part: “It shall be unlawful for any per-\nson who has received any income derived,\ndirectly or indirectly, from a pattern of\nracketeering activity or through collection\nof an unlawful debt in which such person\nhas participated a principal within the\nmeaning of 18 U.S.C. § 2, to use or invest,\ndirectly or indirectly, any part of such\nincome, or the proceeds of such income, in\nacquisition of any interest in, or the estab-\nlishment or operation of, any enterprise\nwhich is engaged in, or the activities of\nwhich affect, interstate or foreign com-\nmerce.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a). “Because\nthe conduct constituting a violation of\n§ 1962(a) is investment of racketeering in-\ncome, a plaintiff must allege injury from\nthe defendant’s investment of the racke-\nteering income to recover under\n§ 1962(a).” Ouaknine v. MacFarlane, 897\nF.2d 75, 83 (2d Cir.1990). The Federal\nPlaintiffs have not done that here and\nseem to abandon the § 1962(a) claim in\ntheir RICO statements. Accordingly, the\nFederal Plaintiffs have not stated a claim\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a).\n\nThe Federal Plaintiffs’ RICO statements\nagainst Arab Bank and the SAAR Net-\nwork assert claims under § 1962(c) and\n§ 1962(d). See 08 MDL 1570 Docket\n## 307, 309. Subsection (ce) states, in\npart: “It shall be unlawful for any person\nemployed by or associated with any enter-\nprise engaged in, or the activities of which\naffect, interstate or foreign commerce, to\n\nconduct or participate, directly or indirect-\nly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s af-\nfairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). “The four\nelements of Section 1962(¢) are ‘(1) conduct\n(2) of an enterprise (8) through a pattern\n(4) of racketeering activity”” U.S. Fire\nIns. Co. v. United Limousine Serv., Inc.,\n3038 F.Supp.2d 482, 451 (8.D.N.Y.2004).\n“The elements of section 1962(c) must be\nestablished as to each individual defen-\ndant.” Jd. Paragraph (d) states that it\n“shall be unlawful for any person to con-\nspire to violate any provision of’ § 1962(a)-\n(ce). 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). “The Second\nCircuit has held in the context of a motion\nto dismiss that to state a claim under [§ ]\n1962(d), the ‘complaint must allege some\nfactual basis for a finding of a conscious\nagreement among the defendants.’” Am.\nArbitration Ass’n, Inc. v. DeFonseca, No.\n98 Civ. 2424(CSH), 1996 WL 363128, at *7\n(S.D.N.Y. June 28, 1996) (quoting Hecht v.\nCommerce Clearing House, 897 F.2d 21,\n26 n. 4 (2d Cir.1990)); see also Schmidt v.\nFleet Bank, 16 F.Supp.2d 340, 354\n(S.D.N.Y.1998) (“Bare and conclusory alle-\ngations are insufficient to withstand a mo-\ntion to dismiss and a plaintiff must plead\nfacts sufficient to show that each defen-\ndant knowingly agreed to participate in\nthe [RICO] conspiracy.”).\n\n[75,76] Assuming for now that the\nPlaintiffs have pleaded an _ enterprise,\n“Tulnder Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S.\n170, 179, 118 S.Ct. 1168, 122 L.Ed.2d 525\n(1993), an alleged RICO defendant must\nhave had ‘some part in directing’ the ‘oper-\nation or management’ of the enterprise\nitself to be liable.” Dubai Islamic Bank v.\nCitibank, N.A., 256 F.Supp.2d 158, 164\n(8.D.N.Y.2003). The complaints allege the\nmoving Defendants may have assisted al\nQaeda, but they do not allege “anything\napproaching active ‘management or opera-\ntion”” Jd.
