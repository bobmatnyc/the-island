  "text": "higher-than-expected International investments. The biggest downside risk is lower\nrevenue if Tinder experiences a decline in popularity or public perception.\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NFLX)\n\nOur $154 price objective is based on a peak penetration sum-of-the-parts analysis\nwhich discounts back future EPS at peak penetration by 10%. At peak penetration, we\nassume domestic streams peak at 65mn subscribers in five years while the international\nsegment reaches 200mn seven years later. We assume APRU of $9.99 and 40%\ncontribution margins for the domestic business and a $8.50 APRU and 40% contribution\nmargin for the international business. We also assume a $1.50 price increase\ndomestically over six years and a $3.60 price increase internationally over twelve years\nwhich will be 75% incremental to operating income. We assume a US tax rate of 40%\nand an international tax rate of 25%. At peak penetration, we assume a 15x S&P\naverage multiple.\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing content costs, 2) potential new\ncompetitors in the company's streaming business, 3) execution challenges and\ncompetition potentially limiting growth in new markets, 4) U.S. saturation point\napproaching quicker than expected, and 5) net neutrality repeal causing ISPs to look to\nrecoup higher rents from Netflix's high bandwidth requirements for streaming.\n\nUpside risks to our price objective are: 1) content costs rising slower than expected, 2)\ntotal subscriber growth is faster than expected, and 3) international expansion into new\nlarge markets (e.g. China).\n\nOnDeck Capital (ONDK)\n\nOur $6 price objective is based on 10x our 2018E EBITDA. This is below the internet\necommerce comparable group (11x) which is justified in our view given OnDeck's double\ndigit revenue growth and potential to expand margins starting in 2018 as it gains scale\nand operating leverage, but tempered by a slower FY18.\n\nUpside risks to our PO are: 1) faster than expected originations growth, 2} signing of\nnew large strategic partners, and 3) lower than expected operating expenses.\n\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) higher than expected loss rates from worsening macro\nenvironment, 2) credit market freeze shutting down liquidity access, 3) lower effective\nyield from competition, and 4) increased marketing spend.\n\nPandora Media, Inc. (P)\n\nOur $9 price objective is based on 1x our 2018 revenue estimate, a significant discount\nto online media and subscription service peers, but justified in our view as the multiple\ntakes into account the company's difficult transition to a subscription on-demand\nservice and lack of near term profitability balanced by the value of its data and user\nbase.\n\nUpside risks to our PO are: 1) direct licensing agreements for lower royalty rates, 2)\ninternational expansion announcements, 3) ad-load increases in key demos, increasing\nmonetization rates, 4) faster than expected launch of on-demand service, and 5) the\ncompany is acquired.\n\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) emerging competition from both other Internet models\nlike Spotify and Apple Music, as well as large, established radio companies like\niHeartMedia embracing Internet streaming, 2) slow down in the company's ability to\ngrow monetization, 3) lack of historical or near-term GAAP profitability, and 4) delayed\non-demand service launch\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n56 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014942",
