  "text": "between 1985 and 2004 in the number of\nAmericans who reported no one with\nwhom to discuss important matters.'©\nWe are a meaning-making species, and\nrelationships that offer security, comfort,\ntrust, and pleasure, even if interactions\nare relatively infrequent, are much more\neffective at fostering a sense of\nconnectedness and belonging than are\nmore friends or more frequent\ninteractions that fail to meet these\nstandards. The challenge, especially for\nthose of us who live in Western society,\nis to recognize that the invisible force of\nsocial connectedness has benefits for\nhealth and well-being that we ignore at\nour peril.\nConclusion\n\nThe research on loneliness\nhighlights the need for and benefits of\nhuman connections, but it speaks even\nmore directly to the role of beliefs about\nour connections. Loneliness, after all, is\nnot about how many social relationships\na person has, but is about a belief that\nthe existing social relationships fail to\nsatisfy a desired sense of social\nconnectedness. All human relationships\nhave a tangible existence in physical\ninteractions and an invisible existence in\nmental representations and beliefs. This\nhuman capacity expands the range of\npossible relationships. For instance,\nhumans form meaningful connections\nwith pets, with television characters\nwhom they have never met, and with\ndeities who lack a material existence.\nWe have seen the health impact of the\ninvisible force of loneliness; do different\nkinds of invisible forces have different\neffects?\nReferences\n\n1.
