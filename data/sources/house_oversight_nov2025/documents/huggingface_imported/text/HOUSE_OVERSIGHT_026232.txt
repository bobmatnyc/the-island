while Trump is in PBI, TSA only allows arrival and departures between 8am and 5pm for General Aviation.
I made a resv for Nov 26th at 8am to St Thomas,,

Passengers: You and

I can make passenger changes up to 24 Hours before Departure, they also request if we are traveling with
an animal., FYI,

They also ask if Passengers are Male or Female, strange, they didn’t ask names.

Thx
