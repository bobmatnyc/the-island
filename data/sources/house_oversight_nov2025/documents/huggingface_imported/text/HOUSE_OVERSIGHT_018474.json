  "text": "and care from each participant. I would advise a person interested in such a relationship\nto only consider it with a partner they know very well; to establish pressure-free\nchannels of communication; and to ensure crystal-clear understanding of how, exactly,\nthe relationship can be ended if anyone involved truly wants it to end.\n\nte OK ok\n\nJournal-Keeping\n\nSome BDSMers play with really, really strong power dynamics. A good example of this\nis couples who choose a \"24/7 dynamic\": one partner is dominant and the other is\nsubmissive... all the time. I attended a workshop once with Sir Top and slave bonnie, two\nwise BDSM educators, where I learned that slave bonnie was only ever allowed to\ndisobey orders of two kinds:\n\n* Suicidal orders,\n* Orders that would cause financial ruin.\nThe rest of the time, bonnie obeyed Top -- all the rest of the time.\n\nObviously, relationships like this are totally cool with me as long as they are -- say it with\nme, everyone -- 100% consensual! Such relationships can also encourage the use of\ninteresting communication tactics, because many of the usual tactics don't feel right to the\nparticipants. For example, these relationships often take place between people who feel\nsuch a strong power dynamic that it would be almost impossible for the submissive to\nfeel comfortable safewording -- safewording can feel disconcertingly like a form of\nresistance.\n\nOne way of dealing with this problem is for both partners to keep journals that are open\nto the other partner. (With some couples, only the submissive keeps an open journal.)\nThey talk about their romantic feelings, they process their sexual encounters, they\narticulate anxieties, etc. Sometimes a partner will give the other one journal prompts to\nanswer. The idea is that it's easier to express these things when there's a designated space\nfor it outside the relationship; the journals mean that partners (especially submissives)\ncan talk about what they need without fearing that they're undermining the power\ndynamic.\n\nI find the concept of simultaneous journals intriguing for a number of reasons. One is that\nI've used similar tactics myself; I kept a private journal for many years, and once in a\nlong while I'd give entries to my partners when I needed to explain something\ncomplicated about my feelings. I only did this a few times, ever, but it was really\neffective when I did.\n\nLater, I took to writing love letters that I noticed were very similar to both my journal\nentries, and to the simultaneous relationship journals suggested for Master/slave couples.\nI realized that I was writing letters because, at the time, I felt more comfortable writing\nabout my desires than talking about them. I've gotten a million times better at talking\nabout my sexuality honestly and shamelessly since then; but back then, there were\ndefinitely things I wrote to my partners that I couldn't have said aloud. I also wrote\nbecause -- just like Master/slave couples -- I wanted to communicate my feelings outside\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018474",
