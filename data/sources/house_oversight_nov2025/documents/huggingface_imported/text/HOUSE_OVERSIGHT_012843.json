  "text": "Subjects in an experiment first listened to people reading trivia, such as “A giraffe can go without\nwater longer than a camel can,” and then judged whether the sentence was true or false. If the sentence\nwas read in a foreign accent, subjects were more likely to say that it was false than if it was read in the\nnative accent. Subjects voiced this opinion even though the experimenter told them that the reader was\nnot expressing an opinion, but merely reading the passage as instructed. In a second experiment, British\nsubjects listening to a non-guilty plea by a person on trial were more likely to judge the person as guilty if\nhe committed a blue collar crime and spoke with a non-standard British accent (e.g., Australian). In\ncontrast, they were more likely to judge a white collar criminal as guilty if he spoke with a standard\nBritish accent. Even within the class of British accents, biases emerged: subjects from the Worcester\nregion were more likely to judge supposed criminals as guilty if they spoke with a Birmingham accent\nthan with a Worcester accent. Together, these studies paint a bleak picture: accents from an out-group are\nperceived as less truthful than others, and in the context of a criminal case, more guilty as well.\n\nAccents are learned early in life, and once in place, are both clear markers of your origins and\ndifficult to undue. As such, they are honest indicators of at least one dimension of group membership.\nWhat about dimensions that can readily be acquired at any point in life, and just as easily dropped? How\ndo these influence not only our perception of those who share these dimensions in common, but how we\ntreat them? In the last chapter I discussed a study by Tania Singer in which both men and women showed\nmore pain empathy — as revealed by activation in the insula region of the brain — when they watched a\ncooperator experiencing pain. Further, men showed a reduction of activity in this area when a cheater\nexperienced pain, and increased activity in a reward area— the nucleus accumbens. This pattern fits well\nwith the research on human and nonhuman animals showing that winning, and watching winners win,\ntriggers a choreographed ballet of physiological responses associated with reward. Singer took this work\nfurther, asking whether an individual’s support for a sport’s team might similarly modulate both the\nfeeling of pain empathy as well as reward. Subjects, all soccer fanatics, sat in a scanner and watched as a\nplayer from their favorite team or a rival experienced pain. Next, Singer provided subjects with three\noptions for interacting with these players: help them by personally taking on some of the pain they would\nreceive, letting them take on all the pain but watch a video as distraction, or let them take on all the pain\nand watch as it happens. Option one is costly altruism, two is blissful ignorance, and three is\nschadenfreude.\n\nIn parallel with the earlier work on fairness, here too Singer observed greater pain empathy when\nthe favorite team player experienced pain than when the rival experienced pain. She also observed that\nsubjects were more likely to help favorite team players by taking on some of their pain, but more likely to\nwatch rivals receive pain. The higher the activation level in the insula, the more they took on their\n\nfavorite team player’s pain session — the more they helped. When they watched rivals experience pain,\n\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 97\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012843",
