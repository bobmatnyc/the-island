  "text": "Clinton's campaign.\n\nThe third episode detailed in the indictment began on June 7th,\nafter reports that Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe would confirm\nstatements made by James Comey about how the president had tried to\nintimidate him. In response, the President began a campaign of\nharassment, threats, and intimidation against McCabe. On March 16,\n2018, after McCabe testified before Congress, the President, in\nretaliation, caused his dismissal and the loss of his pension.\n\nThe Mueller team may have a high hurdle in convincing\nRosenstein to approve the indictment. In its preparation for a possible\nindictment, the Mueller team argues that nothing in the Constitution or\nin a statute suggests a status with regard to criminal prosecution for the\nPresident different from any other federal office. Nor is there any\nstatute or case law that finds that impeachment has to come before an\nindictment. But the Department of Justice's standing view precludes\ncharging a sitting president with a crime. This is based on an opinion\nwritten by the Office of Legal Counsel in the Watergate era and recently\nexpressed in hyperbolic terms by Giuliani: the President could kill James\nComey if he wanted to without fear of prosecution. But, according to\nseveral former DOJ lawyers, Rosenstein in this circumstance may have\nthe power to override the Office of Legal Counsel opinion. The Mueller\nteam appears to believe that Rosenstein's pledge before congress that,\nabsent malfeasance, he will support the Special Counsel's independence\nwith regard to the Russian investigation, means he will let the\nindictment go forward. In one view—and in the suspicion of some in the\nWhite House—he may have already authorized Mueller to proceed with\nthe indictment.\n\nThe White House has made the argument—supported in many\ntelevision appearances by Trump legal surrogate, Alan Dershowitz—\nthat a president cannot be prosecuted for exercising his constitutional\nprerogatives, even if those actions foster a crime, that the President, as\nthe ultimate federal office, and the nation's chief law enforcement\nofficer, enjoys nearly unfettered latitude in how he carries out his\nduties. \"I don't think you are going to find a court who will not see the\npresident's role as unique,\" said one White House advisor. \"The Mueller\ntheories are wishful thinking.\"\n\nAn indictment for obstruction of Justice is described in similar\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030261",
