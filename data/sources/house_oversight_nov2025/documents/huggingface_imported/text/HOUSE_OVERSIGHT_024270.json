He was\nallowed to leave cach day to go to\nwork.\n\nHoping to persuade U.S. District\nJudge Kenneth Marra to throw out\nthe lawsuit that accuses the govern-\nment of violating the federal Crime\nVictims Rights Act, Villafana said\nshe tried to keep Epstein’s victims\ninformed about the investigation\nand the eventual plea deal. But, she\nsaid, negotiations were sensitive\nand neither Epstein, his victims nor\ntheir attorneys made it casy.\n\nFor instance, she said, most of\nthe young women were extremely\n\nBRING YOUR\nHOMETO LIFE!\n\nHome Security Automation,\nPanic/Duress Hold Up Buttons,\nHands-Free Voice Control,\nTotal Connect WiFi Cameras,\nVideo Viewing, Recording & More!\n\nSecuarry Systems\nAuemca’s #1 Secunrry Company Swvce 1874\nKeep an eye on your home from any\nremote location, with any SmartPhone.\nCheck up on kids, babysitters, elderly\nrelatives, pets, housekeepers, contractors\nand more\n* Monitor vulnerable spots like\nentrances, patios, pool areas and more\n* View multiple locations from one\naccount—great for real estate\ninvestors and vacaton home owners\n* Free apps available for iPhone®,\niPad®, BlackBerry® and Android™\n\n47 C-1 Kronprindsens Gade\nSt. Thomas ¢ 774-3355\n\nPrincess Plaza, Christiansted\nSt. Croix * 718-8343\n\nContrary to claims by attomeys representing two of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims in a\nlawsuit against the federal goverment, Assistant U.S. Attomey Marie Villafana\nsaid she and her superiors were trying to help the traumatized young women\nwhen they agreed to let the now 64-year-old money manager plead guilty to state\n\nprostitution charges.\n\nreluctant or simply refused\n\nto testify against Epstein, who had\npaid them to give him sexually-\ncharged massages at his mansion.\n\nOne of the women who is now\nsuing the government insisted Ep-\nstein never abused her, Villafana\nwrote in a sworn affidavit.\n\n“L hope Jeffrey, nothing happens\nto Jeffrey because he's an awe-\nsome man and it would really be a\nshame,” the woman, identified only\nas Jane Doe 2, told FBI agents in\n2007.\n\nWhile Villafana said she didn’t\nbelieve her, she also understood\nthe young woman's suffering.\nFurther, she knew she couldn't\nforce her or Epstein’s more than\n\nCOURTYARD\nSELF STORAGE\n\nSpecial! 1 Month FREE\non all 5’ x 5’ units*\nClimate Controlled Units\nSizes from 5°x5* to 12°x20°\nKeypad Entry/Video Monitoring\nEast End - Smith Bay\n(across from Margarftavilie)\n\n340-776-6008\nwww.courtyardselfstorage.com\n\nSay Goodbye to\n\nUnwanted Hair Forever\n“Electrolysis”\n\nPermanent Hair Removal\nNo more Tweezing or Shaving\nElectrolysis is your permanent solution.\nFacial hair and body hair can be treated.\nLicensed Esthetician’\nCertified Blectrologiet\nCall Today (340) 643-3321\nHavensight, St. Thomas\n\ntwo dozen other victims to testify\nagainst him.\n\nJane Doe 1, who is also suing the\ngovernment, agreed to testify. But\nVillafana said one victim wouldn't\nhave been cnough\nEpstein.\n\nRather than let Epstein use his\nconsiderable influence to evade\nprosecution, she and top officials\nat the U.S. Justice Department\ncrafted the plea deal.\n\nIn exchange for pleading guilty\nto charges of solicitation of prosti-\ntution and soliciting minors to en-\ngage in prostitution in Palm Beach\nCounty Circuit Court, Epstein\nwas not charged with any federal\ncounts. As part of the agreement,\nEpstein had to register as a sex of-\nfender and agree to settle civil law-\nsuits that his roughly 30 victims\nfiled against him.\n\nGetting Epstein to agree to\npay restitution to his victims and\nregister as a sex offender were\nkey, Villafana wrote. Prosecutors\nwanted to assure his victims that\nthey would be compensated and\nthat “other minors throughout the\ncountry” would be protected she\nwrote.\n\nBut shortly after Epstein signed\nthe agreement on Sept. 24, 2007,\nhe began fighting it, she said. He\nand his legal team, including for-\nmer U.S. Solicitor General Ken-\nneth Starr, whose investigation\nled to President Bill Clinton's im-\npeachment, contacted high-level\n\nto convict\n\njustice department officials. They\nchallenged the terms of the non-\nprosecution agreement.\n\nFearing it was falling apart, Vil-\nlafana said her office and the FBI\nresumed the investigation and in-\nformed the victims of that by letter\nin January 2008.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the victims’ at-\ntorneys, Bradley Edwards and Paul\nCassell, say the letter is evidence\nof their claim that prosecutors lied\nto the victims. They also claim that\nprosecutors never told Epstein’s\nvictims about the plea deal.\n\nVillafana said she didn't tell the\nyoung women about the terms of\nthe agreement, fearing Epstein’s\nattorneys would use it to crush\nthem if federal charges were filed\nand the case went to trial. Savvy\nattorneys would argue that the\nwomen were testifying against Ep-\nstein because federal prosecutors\ntold them they would get paid res-\ntitution if they did, she said.\n\nWhen she learned Epstein\nplanned to plead guilty to the two\ncharges in circuit court on June 30,\n2008, Villafana said she immedi-\nately notified Edwards. She said\nshe told him to alert his clients\nso they could attend the hearing.\nNone did.\n\nCassell, a law professor at the\nUniversity of Utah, shrugged off\nthe government's new claims, call-\ning them “meritless.” A written\nresponse will be filed at the end\nof July, he said.\n\nT1am to 2pm\n\nBRUNCH\n\nLive Entertainment\n\n<\nhe Falné\n\nAT PELICAN\n\nCOVE\n\nPalmsPelicanCove.com * STX 340.718.8920\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024270",
