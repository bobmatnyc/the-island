Finally, some inspiration or\ninsight will pop into your head — this is the Eureka moment.\nNow you have a solution but intuitive thinking is far from\ninfallible. You will need to check the solution and may find\nyour answer wrong the first few times. Persevere; you will\nget there in the end.\n\nAs a warm-up exercise, let me give you a simple childhood riddle\nto solve.\n\nA man lives on the twentieth floor of a skyscraper with an\nold elevator.
