He revealed his dark side in a room backstage, where we smoked \na joint, and he told me how he used to read Nazi hate literature to get him in the mood to \nperform. And there was a certain sense of continuity on his deathbed. The night before he died, he said to a \nclose friend, James Drougas, \"Trump will be assassinated soon.\" \n\"Professor\" Corey also had a humanitarian streak. In 1996, in my magazine, The Realist, I published a photo of \nhim, from a video by his son Richard, presenting Fidel Castro a bag of California-grown pistachio nuts (Castro \nsaid, \"California, hmmmm, good climate there for nuts\"), a book on the Rosenberg controversy, and a credit-\ncard-size calculator (Castro said, \"I'll have to use my little pinky to push the buttons\"). Dave Channon reported \nthatCorey was on a diplomatic mission to lift the embargo on health supplies to Cuba, and he visited a hospital \nthat was providing sophisticated treatment for the survivors of Chernobyl. Cuban health care provided for more \nradiation victims than than did the U. .5.\" \nPaul Krassner \nDesert Hot Springs \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033225",
