  "text": "how | fee/about this,’ but they’ re also saying, ‘My feelings should be\neveryone’ s primary concern.’ Now the men are making this mistake,\nthey’ re saying, ‘Your feelings don’ t matter, your feelings are wrong\nand your feelings are stupid.’ If you’ ve ever lived with a woman, you\ncan’ t step in shit worse than that, than to tell a woman that her feelings\ndon’ t matter. So, to the men! say, ‘Listen to what the women are saying\nabout this.’ To the women | say, “Now that we heard you, shut the fuck\nup for a minute, and let’ s all get back together and kill the Jews.’\nThat’ s all | have to say about it.”\n\nThe audience laughed and applauded, as they did fifty years ago\nwhen Lenny Bruce ended a riff on prejudice: “Randy, it won’ t matter any\nmore even if you are colored and I’ m Jewish, and even if Fritz is Japanese,\nand Wong is Greek, because then we’ re all gonna stick together—and\nbeat up the Polacks.”\n\nMy notion of a rape-in of legislators’ wives in order to impregnate\nthem was no more meant to be taken literally than Louis C.K.’ s killing the\nJews or Lenny’ s beating up the Polacks. Rape-in was a misunderstood\nmetaphor; a pro-choice parable that unfortunately has become timely\nagain, but now my target has been clarified, though it's still those\n\nincreasingly incredible sexist legislators.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015418",
