  "text": "Options Risk Statement\n\nPotential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk\n\nUnlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition\ngoverned by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options\ntrading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can\noccur in a short period.\n\nInvestor suitability\n\nThe use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are\nconsidered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are\nencouraged to become familiar with the \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized\nOptions\" (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult\nwith a FINRA Registered Options Principal. For detailed information regarding the risks\ninvolved with investing in listed options:\nhttp:/Avww.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp\n\nPrice objective basis & risk\n\nDeutsche Telekom (DTEGF / DTEGY, B-2-7, EUR17.42/US$19.45)\nOur price objective for DT is EUR18.0/sh (US$19.62) and is derived from our Sum-of-\nthe-Parts analysis.\n\nEach business is valued via DCF (except MtM for TMUS and OTE }) using a 7.0% WACC\nand 1.00% terminal growth rate for Domestic and Western Europe assets (and 8.0%\nWACC/1% term growth for Eastern Europe assets) and cross-checked using implied\nvaluation multiple analysis.\n\nOur Domestic business valuation reflects DT's solid positioning in both fixed (FTTC\nrollout) and mobile (superior network quality, integrated business model).\n\nUpside risks to our PO are any asset sales (US, non-integrated assets in Austria or NL)\nand revenue upside from T-Home's TV push.\n\nDownside risks to our PO are higher than expected mobile impact coming from new\nDrillisch tariffs or failure to turnaround good US operational trends into more profitable\nrevenue streams.\n\nAnalyst Certification\n\nWe, Benjamin Bowler, Clovis Couasnon and Frederic Boulan, CFA, hereby certify that the\nviews each of us has expressed in this research report accurately reflect each of our\nrespective personal views about the subject securities and issuers.
