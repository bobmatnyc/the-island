  "text": "from the SEALs in getting ashore, only one required direct co-ordination with\nus. This was an attack on a DFLP building a mile or so away in southern Beirut,\nled by Amnon Lipkin, the friend whose unit had faced one of the toughest\nbattles at Karameh. Amnon’s paratroop force would land with us and also pile\ninto Mossad rental cars. Our attacks would begin at the same time, with the\nmaximum prospect of retaining the advantage of surprise. When and if we both\ncompleted the operations and got away safely, we would meet up again on the\nseafront.\n\nFrom our first meeting, the morning after Dado gave me the go-ahead, I\nrealized I would have to make at least one change to the plan to rely on the core\nSabena team. There was no way, after his exclusion from the hijack rescue\nmission, that I could refuse Yoni when he pressed to be included. I added him to\nMookie Betzer’s force. I put the other two attack teams under a pair of young\nofficers named Amitai Nachmani and Zvika Gilad. Both were self-confident,\nnatural leaders. Both had other qualities I also knew we’d need: focus, and\ncalm. I would take charge on the street outside the targeted apartments, along\nwith Amiram Levin. With us would be Dov Bar, a Shayetet 13 officer, and our\nmedic, Shmuel Katz.\n\nIn the hangar at the sayeret base, we made mock-ups of the layout of the\napartments, using bedsheets for the walls and adjusting the dimensions as\nfurther bits of intelligence came in from Mossad. But the real work involved\nsimulating the whole operation, from the moment of our landing on jet-black\nrubber dinghies piloted by the SEALs. We found a new building development\nin north Tel Aviv with a pair of apartment blocks under construction. For two\nnights, we ran through the whole thing: setting off in the dinghies from a missile\nboat off the Israeli coast before midnight, meeting up with our Mossad drivers\non shore, making our way through the center of Tel Aviv to the apartment\ncomplexes and simulating the attack. I wanted to ensure we could pull off the\nwhole thing without anyone raising an alarm. The one problem came during the\nsecond run-through. A policeman drove by as we were “attacking” the\napartments. Dado managed to convince him that reporting us to his superiors\nwould not be an especially good idea.\n\nIn our debriefing discussions after that exercise, Dado identified a major\nproblem I’d overlooked. We would be entering Beirut dressed as civilians. Once\nwe got to the top end of Rue Verdun, we planned to approach the apartments as\nif we were party-goers returning from a night on the town. “It doesn’t look\nright,” Dado said. “More than a dozen party people walking, all men?” Mookie\n\n137\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027985",
