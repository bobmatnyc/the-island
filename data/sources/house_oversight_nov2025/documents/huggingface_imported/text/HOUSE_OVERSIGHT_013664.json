  "text": "question (its differential equation) in the form of what is called its Jacobian matrix of\npartial derivatives (a matrix representation of the differential equation indicating\northogonal directional velocities of change of locations of the components of the\nmotion with respect to changing values of the control parameter), we know that\n\nwhen the p of the matrix’s set of two complex conjugate eigenvalues is less than\nzero, p <0, the orbit representing the system, spirals into a stable fixed point. This\n\nis analogous to going to the bottom of the parabolic attractor basin as described\nabove. Values of the invisible eigenvalues and their changes constitute the abstract\nmathematical mechanisms underlying the observable dynamics of the system\nobservable physically.\n\nThe mathematical mechanism underlying the Hopf bifurcation of fixed points\ninto limit cycles (associated with bi-directional splitting that accompanies the\namphetamine transformation into limit cycle stereotypy of rigid ideas and equally\nlikely mirror image motions in the directions of good versus evil) is the crossing of\nthe systems real valued parts, p’s, of its complex conjugate eigenvalues into\npositive territory, o > 0. The mirror image of clock arrows is transformed from 8:00\nand 10:00 o'clock to the clock locations of 4:00 and 2:00. At a Hopf bifurcation, a\npair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary (vertical) axis such\nthat is real parts have positive value. In the orbit representing the motions of the\nsystem itself, the fixed point disappears to be replaced by the action spiraling out to\nan invariant circle. This is analogous to our manifold image of the disappearance of\nthe central attractive point and the sudden appearance of a small hill at the bottom\nof a parabolic basic of attraction.. The new attractor is an invariant circular path\naround the hill, with the spiraling out to the invariant circle being a two dimensional\npicture of the disappearance of the bowl-bottom and appearance of a missing point,\nhill top fixed point and a spiral flow to the path circling the hill. Underlying the\ntransition from a fixed point to a limit cycling, invariant circle, are a pair of mirror\nimage complex conjugate eigenvalues that turn in mirror image, we could say, good\nversus evil, opposite directions. The Hopf bifurcating system inevitably has both.\n\nThe implications of this very abstract metaphor for the emergent limit cycle-\n\nsplitting style of spiritual transformation can be made deeper by considering the\n\n164\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013664",
