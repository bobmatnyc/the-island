In 1994, Trump took a 13-year-old girl to a party with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire
who was a notorious registered sex offender, and raped her that night in what was a
"savage sexual attack," according to a lawsuit filed in June 2016 by "Jane Doe." The
account was corroborated by a witness in the suit, who claimed to have watched as the
child performed various sexual acts on Trump and Epstein even after the two were
advised she was a minor.

"Immediately following this rape Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to
reveal any of the details of Defendant Trumpa€™s sexual and physical abuse of me, my
family and I would be physically harmed if not killed," Jane Doe wrote in the lawsuit,
filed in New York.

The lawsuit was dropped in November 2016, just four days before th lection, with Jane
Doe's attorneys citing "numerous threats" against her.
