  "text": "marijuana joint, huh? It’ s legal here in Alaska. Did you know that? But it\nhas to be only one ounce or less. And then you have to smoke it in your\nown house. |’ m gonna wait till I’ m thirteen before | try it. Bristol and\nLevi smoke it when Mommy’ s out making a speech. If she was here,\nshe’ d smell it right away, so then they have to go somewhere else.\nMommy says, “Pot may be part of God’ s plan, but not in this house.”\n\nShe’ s always saying that something is part of God’ s plan, but | don’ t\nunderstand what she means about that. Are hurricanes and train crashes\npart of God’ s plan too? Anyhow, you’ re not supposed to smoke\nanything when you’ re pregnant, right? Hey, Trig, you wanna hear what |\nthink would be a nice name for Bristol’ s baby? Diversion. | didn’ t think\nof that by myself. | heard my teacher tell another teacher that Mommy’ s\nbaby is a diversion. | think it could be for either a boy or a girl. Hey, my\ntongue is dry. | don’ t have any watchamacallit, any salvia left. Maybe if |\njust have a little sip of your moose’ n’ banana shake. /Drinks from bottle]\n\nIt’ s really yummy...\n\n[Track Is riding a stationery bike in his room while talking with\n\nWillow.]\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015157",
