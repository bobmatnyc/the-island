  "text": "254 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nvious meetings with Bamford. So I sent Kucherena, via Zamir, ten\nquestions that I wanted to ask Snowden.\n\nI next obtained a multi-entry Russian visa from the Russian con-\nsulate in New York and booked myself a room in the Hotel National.\n\nMy night flight from New York to Moscow took just less than\neight hours and landed at Terminal D of Sheremetyevo Interna-\ntional Airport at 7:40 a.m. on October 29, 2015. I did not immedi-\nately proceed through passport control, in part because I wanted to\nexplore the transit zone in which Snowden was supposedly trapped\nfor six weeks.\n\nSheremetyevo Two, where all international flights land, was built\nin the waning days of the Cold War for international passengers\narriving for the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics. It was modern-\nized in 2010, including opening a walkway that connects Terminals\nD, E, and F for transit passengers.\n\nSnowden had vanished, at least from public view, in this com-\nplex of terminals for nearly six weeks in the summer of 2013. His\nexplanation to journalists, as will be recalled, was two part. First, he\n\n© said he had planned to board the next fight to Cuba and from there ©\nproceed to Ecuador. He said that he was unable to board this flight\nbecause his passport had been invalidated by the U.S. government\nwhile he was flying to Russia. Second, after discovering his passport\nhad been revoked, he stayed in a capsule hotel in the transit zone for\nthe next thirty-nine days. To better understand the plausibility of\nhis version of those events, I proceeded through the transit passage\nto Terminal F, where Snowden’s plane from Hong Kong had landed\nat 5:15 p.m. Moscow time on June 23, 2013.\n\nSnowden did not go through passport control upon arrival.\nBefore any of the other passengers were allowed to disembark from\nthe plane, Russian plainclothes officers from the special services\nboarded the plane and asked both Snowden and Sarah Harrison, his\nWikiLeaks-supplied “ninja,” to accompany them to a waiting car\nthat whisked them away. According to the account in Izvestia, “A\nspecial operation was conducted for his reception and evacuation.” It\nfurther said, “Snowden’s flight to Moscow was coordinated with the\nRussian authorities and intelligence services.”\n\nIf not for the “special operation,” he could have easily gone by foot\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r.indd 254 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019742",
