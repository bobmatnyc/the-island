The debriefing sessions, which went on for fifteen\ndays, were from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. In them, Pelton managed to\nrecall Project A, a joint NSA-CIA-navy operation in which subma-\nrines surreptitiously tapped into Soviet undersea cables in the Sea\nof Okhotsk, which connected to the Soviet Pacific Fleet’s mainland\nheadquarters at Vladivostok. Pelton received another $30,000 from\nthe KGB.\n\n“Did the information in his head prove valuable?” I asked.\n\n“As long as the NSA didn’t know the tap was compromised by\nPelton, we could use the cable to send the NSA the information we\nwanted it to intercept.” He said that while actual NSA documents\nwould have proved more useful than someone’s memories, “Our job\nis to take advantage of whatever we can get.”\n\nTwo years later, Pelton was again flown to Vienna for another\ndebriefing to see if he could recall any further details. According to\nCherkashin, the KGB’s job was to leave no stone unturned when\nit came to the NSA’s sources. In 1985, the KGB’s task ended when\nPelton was arrested by the FBI. Like Ames and Hanssen, Pelton was\n\n© sentenced to life imprisonment. ©\n\nLooking at his watch, Cherkashin politely excused himself.\n\nI subsequently spoke to Colonel Oleg Nechiporenko, who had\nbeen a foreign intelligence officer in the KGB between 1958 and\n1985 and continued his intelligence work until recently as chief\ncounterterrorism expert of the Russian-led Collective Security\nTreaty Organization. Over a leisurely coffee in the bar of the Hotel\nNational, he told me that many “walk-ins” who contacted Soviet\nofficials in his time were emotionally disturbed, but all of them had\nto be assessed for possible intelligence value. “Our job was to find\nespionage sources,” he said with a twinkle in his eye. “The Internet\nhas changed the espionage business since secret documents can be\nmassively downloaded by an unhappy employee,” he said, “but they\nstill need to be assessed by a professional.”\n\nThrough the eyes of the KGB, a penetration of American intel-\nligence was clearly opportunistic. If these practices continued, they\nput Snowden’s situation in a new light for me. If Russian intelli-\ngence considered it worthwhile to send a former civilian worker at\nthe NSA, such as Ronald Pelton, two thousand miles from Washing-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 263 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019751",
