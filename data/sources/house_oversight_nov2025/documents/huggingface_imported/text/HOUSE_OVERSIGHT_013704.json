  "text": "back (“fold”) into the spiral unpredictably somewhere in a mixing mechanism that\nhas been called “displaced reinjection.” In the slow-fast oscillations of the forced van\nder Pol in the chaotic regime, points in the slow phase (“repolarization”) jitter around\nand step on each other’s heels, getting out of order while waiting on the ledge\nbefore jumping (“depolarization”) to the next slow phase (“repolarization”) at some\n\nunpredictable time, thus generating a variably irregular series of interspike intervals.\n\nStretching and folding are also responsible for getting points get out of order\nin the single maximum map of the unit interval (studied for universal qualitative and\nquantitative properties by May and Feigenbaum and others as described above).\nWith increases in parameter values, the parabolic hill function onto which the unit\nline has been stretched gets steeper, more stretched. Mapping points on the hill\nback onto the straight line of the unit interval results in what amounts to the line\nfolding back on itself. This stretching and folding eventually fills the line with points,\nbut their sequence, from end to end, gets shuffled like a deck of cards.\n\nAs described more generally above, points that start as neighbors may get\nseparated (“divergence along the attractor’) and those that start at a distance from\neach other may be thrown together (“compression back onto the attractor’). These\nexpanding and folding motions that characterize the chaotic behavior on strange\nattractors have been likened to the actions of a taffy puller (Réssler, 1976). It is in\nthis way that nearby points can separate without leaving the attractor. It is also the\ncase that once indistinguishably close but then separated points may be\ncompressed together again generating new, temporary (unstable) cycles of all\npossible period lengths. These unstable fixed points may be the most important\nfeature of chaotic systems from the standpoint of new ideas about brain\nmechanisms (Pei and Moss, 1996; So et al, 1997). This aggregation of unstable\nloops can occur from points fluctuating away and back to the attractor as well as\nduring the crowding of points at the turns after their stretching out on more linear\nparts of the flow. Under the mixing flow of a chaotic dynamics, it is also true that a\nsingle point eventually explores the entire attractor, no attractor location is\n\ninaccessible to it.\n\n204\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013704",
