  "text": "To be sure, some recent achievements in artificial intelligence have been\nremarkably impressive. Computers can now produce visual artworks and musical\ncompositions akin to those of recognized masters, creating just the sort of “information”\nthat Wiener most prized. But by far the largest impact on society to date has come from\nthe collection and manipulation of Shannon-like information, which has reshaped our\nshopping habits, political participation, personal relationships, expectations of privacy,\nand more.\n\nWhat might “deep learning” evolve into, if the fundamental currency becomes\n“information” as Wiener defined it? How might the field shift if re-animated by\nWiener’s deep moral convictions, informed as they were by his prescient concerns about\nrampant militarism, runaway corporate profit-seeking, the self-limiting features of\nsecrecy, and the reduction of human expression to interchangeable commodities?\nPerhaps “deep learning” might then become the cultivation of meaningful information\nrather than the relentless pursuit of potent, if meaningless, bits.\n\n113\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016333",
