  "text": "only way to become a great general and master the secrets of war.”!°° I sometimes\nfee] the same reading over stories of zero-day attacks, clever hacks like\n“rowhammer’” or the Tel Aviv heat hack. You can distill from each tale of a broken,\nonce-secure systems an essential principle: The hackers rush always, relentlessly at\nthe central core of a system. They aim to make it weird, to manipulate it madly from\nthe inside out. Network power doesn’t merely come from that 10 million device-per-\nday spread of global connectivity, after all, it also comes from incredible\nconcentration of power inside certain systems we all rely on: Chips, data bases,\ncentralized and gatekept platforms. Control of such hubs and roots of our world can\ninfluence everything; little wonder they are such an appealing target. “The\nconventional belief that all nuclear systems are ‘air gapped’ is a myth,” the Russian\nsecurity researcher Eugene Kaspersky has warned. The result: “There are three\ntypes of people: Scared to death. Opportunists. Don’t care.”151\n\nThis sense that the systems are so vulnerable if you can get to their hearts is what\nlures hackers ever deeper, into the code kernels where the most basic instructions\nare decided. That they can often make machines weird by using the device’s own\ncode against them, like some sort of autoimmune disease, is only a marker of the\nparticular perversity of the problem here. Security researchers call such holes\n“vulnerabilities” in a system, but of course they are much more than weak spots.\nThey are potentially fatal. In a way, the hot rush to touch and tickle and maliciously\nuse these already waiting cancers reveals to us the essential Seventh Sense secret of\nthe Warez Dudes: Connection makes an object vulnerable, yes; but it can also reveal\nthe possibility of total control, of the fundamental root mastery of a connected\nsystem. Such a hole, when it is exposed by connection and then corruption, can be\ncomplete in the scope of its damage, devastating. Lord Acton’s famous line that\n“Absolute power corrupts absolutely,” twists in this age to something like “Absolute\naccess corrupts absolutely.” Connection makes total exploitation, total control,\npossible.\n\nEvery new generation of connected technologies is breeding essential black boxes,\ncomplex (not merely complicated!) containers filled with algorithmic levers and\ncode tools for digital work that can be understood by only a few people, and\nexploited and used effectively — for good or ill - by a still smaller group. “The greater\nthe dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner\nworkings,” one group of radical digital activists has argued in The Critical\nEngineering Manifesto. 52 They mean that as we turn our safety, freedom, and health\nover to a world of devices and their makers, we must know what goes on inside the\nvery heart of such systems. It’s not merely that everything is connected now; it’s\n\n150 “Read over and over”: Napoleon, “Maxims” from Thomas Raphael Phillip, ed.,\nRoots of Strategy: The 5 Greatest Military Classics of All Time, (Stackpole Books 1985)\np 432\n\n151 “There are three types:” Eugene Kaspersky Talk at the Press Club in Canberra,\nAustralia (2013)\n\n152 “The greater the dependence”: “The Critical Engineering Manifesto,” The\nCritical Engineering Working Group, Berlin, October 2011-2014.
