But we talked at length about Israel’s immediate security\nconcerns, as well as the country’s longer-term challenges in finding its place in\nmore stable, peaceful Middle East. How, over time, we might manage to\nextricate ourselves from the escalating violence with Hizbollah; reach a land-\nfor-peace deal with the enigmatic President Hafez al-Assad in Syria; and find\nsome form of coexistence with the Palestinians.\n\nHe also spoke about international politics. I remember one afternoon in the\nsummer of 1992 when he mentioned the then US presidential candidate Bill\nClinton. He’d met Clinton for the first time in Washington, after two days of\ntalks with President Bush at his summer home in Maine. Rabin was naturally\nmore comfortable dealing with Republicans. Almost all his experience in public\nlife — as a military officer, ambassador to Washington, Defense Minister and\nPrime Minister — had coincided with Republican administrations. The irony was\nthat he would go on to forge a much closer relationship with President Clinton\nthan between any previous Israeli and US leader. But his first impression was\nmore skeptical. “Clearly, Clinton is very intelligent,” he said. “He is\nsurprisingly sharp politically for someone his age. But also, I fear, a little bit too\nslick.”\n\nWe did not have long to focus on the lessons and implications of Tze’elim.\nFor weeks before the training accident, a crisis had been building in south\nLebanon, with a sharp escalation of the now-familiar mix of clashes inside our\n“security zone” and cross-border rocket attacks. Hizbollah was now armed not\njust with Katyushas but Saggers, American-made TOW anti-tank missiles and\nan increasingly sophisticated array of roadside bombs. A combination of\nHizbollah attacks and “friendly fire” incidents or firearms accidents involving\nour troops meant that Israelis were still dying in Lebanon a decade after the\nformal end of the war. It was demoralizing for the Israeli public, for the soldiers\nwho we rotated into the security zone and for the government as well. The\ndifficulty was that it was also a situation that perfectly suited Hizbollah.\n\nIn late October, a Katyusha rocket had claimed the life of a 14-year-old boy\nin the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. Hizbollah escalated its rocket\nfire in the days that followed, forcing tens of thousands of residents into their\nshelters. Predictably, there was pressure from Likud politicians to hit back hard.\n\n250\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011721",
