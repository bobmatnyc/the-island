  "text": "/ BARAK / 62\n\nI was confident of finally answering that question at the summit. Camp David\nwas different from Shepherdstown. No reporters would be there. Mobile phones\nwere banned. Each delegation had one landline. We’d also be operating under a\ntime constraint. President Clinton was due to leave for a G8 summit in Japan on\nJuly 19. The gave us barely a week. I did wonder whether that would be enough,\neven if both sides were committed to reaching a peace agreement. Yet I hoped it\nwould at least provide the possibility, as it had for Begin and Sadat twenty-two\nyears earlier, to reach a framework agreement that open the door to a final peace\ntreaty.\n\nNot just the time, but the numbers were limited. We and the Palestinians could\nhave only a dozen members in our negotiating teams. Some of my choices were\nautomatic: Danny Yatom; Shlomo Ben-Ami, whom I’d made acting Foreign\nMinister in Levy’s absence; Amnon Lipkin and Attorney-General Elyakim\nRubinstein; Gilead Sher and his chief negotiating aide, Gidi Grinstein. I also took\nalong a strong security team, including Shlomo Yanai, head of strategic planning\nthe kirya, and Israel Hason, a former deputy-head of Shin Bet. There was another\nimportant, if less obvious, inclusion: Dan Meridor. A leading member of the Likud\nbefore he’d formed the Center Party at the last election, Dan was not just a friend.\nHe was a man of rock-solid integrity, with a strong moral and ethical compass,\nwho put principle over party. He was also a lawyer, and had been Minister of\nJustice under Bibi. Along with Attorney-General Rubinstein, I knew I’d have a\ngifted legal team if we got to the point of considering the specifics of a peace\nagreement. There was another consideration as well. Both Dan and Elyakim were\nright-of-center politically. I felt I needed their voices as a kind of litmus for the\ntough decisions, and concessions, I might have to consider if an agreement did\nprove possible.\n\nI was not nervous as we crossed the Atlantic, though even those who knew me\nbest assumed I would be. Nava had sent me off with a list of dietary instructions,\nalmost like a surgeon general’s warning that Camp David might prove hazardous\nto my health. But I felt prepared. I’d gone to every source I could find about the\nBegin-Sadat summit. I knew there would be periods of crisis and that at certain\npoints I’d have to allow leeway for my own team to explore possible compromises\nbeyond our set negotiating limits. Yet none of this altered my belief that holding\nthe summit was the right thing to do, nor my confidence in being able to play my\npart. I did feel a huge responsibility.
