I asked\nher to leave, and she wouldn’t. And I said, ‘I’m going to call the police if you don’t,’ and I\nwent to call the police and she left,” Cooke said. “And that’s the end of the story.”\n\nBannon grew up in Richmond, the newspaper noted.\n\nThe Richmond Police Department confirmed the call was made but the call was canceled\nbefore officers responded.\n\n“We are a bookshop. Bookshops are all about ideas and tolerating different opinions and not\nabout verbally assaulting somebody, which is what was happening,” Cooke said.\n\nTrump's Supreme Court shortlist\nBy The Hill\n\nRead More\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024300",
