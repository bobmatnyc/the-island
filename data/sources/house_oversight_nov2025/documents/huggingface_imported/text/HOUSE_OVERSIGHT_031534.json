  "text": "of Friday night lights. Baylor was making a statement — McLaneean Stadium is for all of us, not just for\nBaylor Nation on college game day.\n\nAs | mentioned in a previous chapter, “Field of Dreams” brought into popular culture an abiding idea — if\nyou build it, they will come. Unlike a Midwestern corn field turned into a ghostly baseball diamond\nsummoning forth spirits from bygone days, McLaneean Stadium — which at Coach Briles’ insistence was\nrenamed (prior to opening) to carry the McLean family name rather than the institutionalized, plain-\nvanilla “Baylor Stadium” — brought tens of thousands of fans and friends to the banks of the Brazos.\nSeason ticket sales skyrocketed. Games were now sold out. At the aging Floyd Casey Stadium, albeit\nhome to great memories over a half century, we worked hard to fill the seats. The occasional sell-out\nwould occur when, say, the Longhorns came to Waco and eagerly bought up the thousands of unwanted\ntickets. That was then. Now, ESPN regularly brought “Game Day” to campus, and the prevailing colors\nwere the beautiful gold of the Baylor Line, with shades of Baylor green sprinkled in. The optics were\neven better than at green-and-gold dominated Lambeau Field in Green Bay.\n\nAnd so Sam Ukwuachu came. He had traveled way north from Houston, where he had done well\nenough academically in high school but whose strength and speed attracted the attention of gridiron\nprograms across the country. He chose national powerhouse Boise State, but he was soon unhappy and\nhomesick. His head football coach looked after him, thought he should be closer to home, called Coach\nBriles, and soon Sam was a Baylor Bear, although he never played football at Baylor. When Sam was\ncharged with the unspeakably horrible act of rape, he protested his innocence and defended himself\nvigorously. Devastating testimony by a former girlfriend from Boise State — who contradicted Sam’s\ntestimony of non-violence — likely sealed his fate. The McLennan County jury found him guilty, but then\nfashioned an oddly lenient sentence — probation. As! write, Sam continues to protest his innocence, and\nto seek redress in the courts. But the jury verdict stands, and Sam is thus a convicted felon.\n\nExplosion II\n\nEven in the best of programs horrible deeds are done. We are a fallen race. Even young men from\n“good families” succumb to temptation and allow themselves to enter the darkest of dark domains. The\nnationally-debated case of the Stanford swimmer, convicted of rape but given a lenient sentence, once\nagain brought into sharp focus the problem of interpersonal violence on and around college campuses,\nand in particular, sexual assault. National statistics were frequently reported to the effect that 1 in 5\nyoung women are sexually assaulted (or are otherwise victims of interpersonal violence) during their\ncollege years. Sam’s case provided the jumping off point for Texas Monthly’s provocative thesis that\nwith all of its vaunted success, Coach Briles’ program was infected by a culture of violence against\nwomen.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031534",
