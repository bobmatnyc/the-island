  "text": "58 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nCryptoParty, Tor station, and other anti-NSA activities could go\nunremarked upon. After all, ten or so NSA workers attended the\nfirst party, and it is not unlikely that many of them recognized\nhim as their co-worker. If so, they knew (as did Sandvik and Mills)\nthat the Tor advocate “Cincinnatus” was Snowden. He had also not\nbeen shy in contacting notable enemies of the NSA via e-mail, such\nas Jacob Appelbaum, Parker Higgins, and Asher Wolf. If anyone,\nincluding the security staff of the NSA, had been on the lookout for\ndissident intelligence workers, this well-advertised gathering and its\norganizer might have been of interest.\n\nIn 2014, I asked a former top NSA executive whether such activi-\nties on behalf of Tor by an NSA employee would arouse the atten-\ntion of the NSA’s own “Q” counterespionage unit. He answered,\n“Snowden was not an NSA employee.” Because Snowden was a\ncontract employee of Dell’s residing in the United States, the NSA\ncould not legally monitor his private activities or intercept his com-\nmunication. To do so would require a court-approved FBI request. So\nSnowden/Cincinnatus was free to operate openly in recruiting NSA\n\n© workers, hacktivists, and computer buffs for his events. Ironically, ©\nadversary intelligence services searching for disgruntled intelligence\nworkers had no such constraints.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 58 ® 9/29/16 5:51PM |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019546",
