  "text": "be expressed in ways which do not take these appearances into account...and can\nbe specialized at will... DNA sequences are, as MIT molecular biologist, Eric\nLander observed, nothing more than an elementary “...list of parts...” In fact, since\nabout 1% of the nucleotides are relevant to functional genes, one might say that the\nimportant members of this list of parts are distributed very thinly among many more\napparently unimportant ones. The next frontier will certainly involve § an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the interactions among elemental parts and in\nmore abstract laws about molecular biological relations; a focus on the dynamics,\n\nnot the structural parts, that regulate and control their expression.\n\n* * *\n\n| made a pilgrimage to spend eighteen months within Rene’ Thom’s\npenumbra, living among mathematicians in his “ashram” in Bures sur Y’vette,\nFrance. Thom was one of the founders of the /nstitute des Hautes D’Etudes, IHES,\nInstitute for Advanced Scientific Studies, created to stanch the flow of high-level\nscientific talent away from France after the Second World War. It is in Bures sur\nY’vette, deep in a green forested valley, 50 or so miles South of Paris, in a building\npacked with small, thin walled, big windows-on-the-woods offices. Each office\ncontained a single hard chair, an old office desk, two walls of blackboards and a box\nof white only chalk. The use of colored chalk was felt to be without mathematical\nrigor because its use substitutes colors as dimensional descriptors for more\ndemanding abstract and formal representations. Color was cheating. Meditation in\nthis ashram was practiced by staring, pacing, scribbling, and humming, mumbling,\nbelching and farting through the Institute’s thin office walls. The building, though\nalmost completely occupied, was otherwise silent. The Institute was populated by\nsuch world-class mathematicians and theoretical physicists that once inside that\nbuilding, | felt so intimidated that | almost never spoke above a whisper. Listening to\nexcellent William Thurston’s casual use of a tiled bathroom floor to motivate a\nunique partition of a topological space, | was attacked by the awe of an early\nmorning visit to an almost empty Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris or standing in front\n\nof Michelangelo’s radiant marble statue of Mary and Jesus the Infant in the Vatican.\n\n52\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013552",
