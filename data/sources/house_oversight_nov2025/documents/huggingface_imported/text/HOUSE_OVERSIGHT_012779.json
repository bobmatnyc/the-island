  "text": "primates, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects. And of course, there are animals\npopulating every other continent and the seas that surround them. Among the social animals — those\nliving in groups — the common form of aggression is one-on-one, and the context is typically\ncompetition over food, a place to rest, or access to a mate. Sometimes the aggression is initiated as an\nattack and sometimes it is in self-defense. Sometimes it 1s highly ritualized and planned, and sometimes it\nis areactive free-for-all. Sometimes it occurs within the group and sometimes between. Severe injuries\narise, but deaths are rare. The aim is to resolve a competitive dispute by means of non-lethal aggression,\nand if possible, non-physical contact. If someone dies it is because an injury leaves them incapacitated or\nvulnerable to disease. It is not because their opponent aimed to kill. The ubiquity of non-lethal aggression\npoints to a suite of common biological ingredients, a core set of neurobiological, hormonal and\npsychological adaptations that constrain how animals fight.\n\nIt all starts with one individual perceiving a valuable resource that is within reaching distance of a\ncompetitor. What launches a first move and subsequently guides the process to its completion with a\nwinner and a loser? In some species there are rules of thumb that deflate any aggressive instincts before\nthey are launched, even though there are clear competitive interests. For example, in territorial lizards\nand birds, if an emigrating individual lands in an area and sees or hears another individual vigorously\ndisplaying — push-ups with colorfully flashing neck sacs in lizards, vocal arias in birds — they move on.\nThe rule: territory owners win, no questions asked. Another rule of thumb arises in species organized\naround either permanent or breeding-only harems: one male and many females. Two classic cases are the\nwell-studied hamadryas baboons of Ethiopia and the elephant seals of California. In both species, males\nare much larger than females, with elephant seals providing an extreme case — the harem master can be\nten times bigger than the females he mates with. In hamadryas, no one challenges the male over access to\nthe females in his harem. Competition arises in acquiring females into a harem, a process that starts early,\nwith individual males recruiting juvenile females. In elephant seals, either one or a few males completely\nmonopolize the mating among the often hundred or more females within the harem. These males rule. As\nevidenced by genetic fingerprinting, virtually all of the offspring are sired by 1-3 males. No mating\ncompetition. Competition arises when the young turks try to wear down the harem master through\nrepeated challenges over the season. Eventually, often over the course of several mating seasons, the\nharem master loses a fight and hangs up his gloves.\n\nDominance hierarchies provide another set of rules or norms that guide competition, and thus\naggression. In general, irrespective of the species, high ranking animals outcompete low ranking animals\nfor access to resources. If the spread between two individuals within the hierarchy is large, the\nsubordinate acts like a migrating lizard or bird landing in a resident’s territory: no contest, no competition,\n\nno fighting. If the spread is less, say two individuals who hold adjacent positions within the hierarchy,\n\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 33\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012779",
