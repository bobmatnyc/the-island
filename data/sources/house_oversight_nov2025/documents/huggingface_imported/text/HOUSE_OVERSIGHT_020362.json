So Snowden’s motive is a missing part of\nthe puzzle. It also cannot even be assumed that he had a single consistent motive during the nine-\nmonth course of his illicit copying of documents. Snowden has shown, if nothing else, that he is\nadaptable. He may have began taking documents for one reason and found other reasons as he\nproceeded in his quest. Many of the circumstances of his probes, contacts, theft and escape\nremain disputed by his supporters and shrouded by the secrecy of the NSA. What we do know is\nthat Snowden made four extraordinary choices during the nine month period in 2013 that speak to\nthe concerns that may have guided his actions. In the case of a classified intelligence breach, as\nin a chess game, the sequence of moves a player makes provides an important clue to his strategy.\n\nThe first move that Snowden made in preparation of the Level 3 breach was switching jobs on\nMarch 15th 2013. Snowden chose to leave his job as a system administrator at Dell SecureWorks\nto take job at Booz Allen as an analyst-in-training. His motive was not money, as it was a lower-\npaying position. At the time, he made this choice he had already set up an encrypted channel with\nLaura Poitras for the purpose of sending her secret material. But he did not have to change jobs\nto send her secrets. So what was his purpose in making this fateful choice?\n\nThe job change was not necessary to expose NSA domestic activities. If he had only wanted to\nbe a whistle-blower, there were ample documents about the NSA’s activities already available to\nhim on the NSANet. He also had access at Dell to the administrative file which contained the\nFISA court orders issued every three months to Verizon. In addition, as the NSA’s damage\nassessment established, before switching jobs Snowden had already taken most of the documents\npertaining to the NSA’s domestic operations that he could have supplied to Poitras and\nGreenwald for whistle-blowing purposes. Indeed, while still at Dell, it will be recalled, he had he\nhad told Poitras he had a copy of Presidential Policy Directive 20, a document in which President\nObama authorized the NSA to tap into fiber cables crossing the United States. Snowden\ndescribed it to her as “a kind of martial law for cyber operations, created by the White House.”\nTrue, he took a more recently-issued FISA warrant and PRISM presentation in April after\nswitching jobs, but he could have just as easily taken the January 2013 version of the FISA\nwarrant from the administrative file of Dell. It would have had the same explosive effect in the\nmedia.\n\nNor did he switch jobs to lessen the risk of getting caught. He actually put himself in far greater\njeopardy by switching jobs. At Dell he was relatively safe from apprehension since he could take\ndocuments, such as the above-mentioned Presidential Policy Directive 20, from access points at\nthe NSA shared by many of his peers. Since these shared access points provided the equivalent of\na common reading room at a library, it would be difficult to trace the theft of any documents\ntaken from them to a particular user. Indeed, if he just wanted to expose the NSA’s domestic\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020362",
