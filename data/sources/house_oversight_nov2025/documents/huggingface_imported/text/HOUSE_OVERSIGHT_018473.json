  "text": "away. They can just sit down, fill out their checklists and compare results without getting\ntoo worried about how to bring up certain desires. I mean, at some point of course they'll\nhopefully talk about it, but hopefully the checklist framework makes it easier and lower-\n\npressure.\n\n3) Concurrently, it provides an easy way to turn down acts -- it's much harder to reject a\nlover's proposition when ze says, \"Darling, can I flog you?\" than it is when you simply\nfill in one bubble on the \"Flogging -- Receiving\" section. In the past, I've certainly felt a\nlot of anxiety when I wanted to turn down partners, and it's nice to imagine a set-up that\nwould have made me feel less anxious.\n\nIn fact, I love the checklist concept so much that when the University of Illinois at\nChicago had me design my sexual communication workshop, I created a \"vanilla\" version\nof the checklist that had entries ranging from \"oral sex\" to \"sex in public” to \"tying up /\nbeing tied up.\" (Okay, maybe it wasn't entirely vanilla... I wanted to encourage people to\nvoice things they weren't sure about!) Then I later found out that the amazing sex\neducation site Scarleteen has created its own non-BDSM checklist, and theirs is way\nbetter than mine.\n\nI just love the principle of the thing -- the principle that a couple can have a lot of fun\njust by sitting down and talking about every conceivable sex act, being presented with\nsome options that they maybe haven't thought of before, and honestly describing how\ninto each idea they each are.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/06/14/sex-communication-tactic-derived-from-sm-1-\n\nchecklists/\n\nCOMMUNICATION:\n\n[theory] Sex Communication Tactic Derived From S&M: Journal-\nKeeping\n\nThis is part of the same 2010 series as the previous two articles. In this piece, I\nmentioned 24/7 Master/slave relationships, which I had just learned about. Since then,\nI've learned a lot more about those relationships. I have never been in one, although I\nhave occasionally had partners order me to do long-term submissive things. But I've read\nand heard a lot of tales about 24/7 M/s.\n\n24/7 Master/slave scenarios are rare... and I will say that there are some awful horror\nstories floating around about them. Some BDSMers say that 24/7 Master/slave\nrelationships are always a terrible idea and should never be done. I am unwilling to\ncondemn them so thoroughly, but those relationships obviously require a lot of respect\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018473",
