  "text": "Religion, including Hinduism and Islam, can help Indians define their\nindividual identity. But in a country of such size and diversity, one that is\nhome to a third of the world’s poor, only secular rule can ensure the unity\nneeded to fulfill people’s collective hopes.\n\n“India has won,” Modi tweeted after his victory. This apparent humility\nmay serve him well in preventing an overreach of his powers. India does\nnot need big-man style rule now that a historic election has shown Indians\nare ready to dream big.\n\nArticle 5.\n\nHiirriyet\nWill it be Cyprus’ year?\nYusuf Kanli\n\n19 May 2014 -- The highlight of the one-day trip to North Cyprus by\nForeign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu might best be his bold declaration that\ntime has come to end the 50-year-old Cyprus problem. Can there be\nrelevance between the age and the time for the resolution of a problem?\nObviously not, but a minister expressing conviction that time has come to\nend a problem carries incredible importance and naturally boosts\nexpectations to that end.\n\nIs it really the high time, best opportunity, right moment, last chance or\nwhatever for a Cyprus deal? All through the past many decades, somehow\nmany prominent and otherwise effective personalities, including not only\nDavutoglu and people of his caliber, but many premiers, presidents and at\nleast every American leader since George Bush Sr. have declared many of\nthe past years as the “Cyprus year” but that Cyprus year never came...\nWill it come this time? Sure... the Cyprus problem could easily be\nresolved if the two sides on the island ever develop sufficient political\nwill; prepare their respective societies to be receptive to a painful\ncompromise and international actors stop paying lip service to the idea of\na resolution, but instead genuinely support a resolution.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031580",
