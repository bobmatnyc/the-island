They are my passions,\nas they have been since I was old enough to appreciate these \"Iuxuries\"--inexpensive as they were\nto us--that my parents couldn't afford. I was never exposed to classical music or art, even in\nschool where the music teacher taught us \"exotic\" songs like “finicula, funicula,” American songs\nby Stephen Foster, and an assortment of religious and Zionist Hebrew songs. (Zum Gali, Gali,\nGali; Tsena, Tsena; Hayveynu Shalom Alechem.) Our art teachers tried to teach us to draw\n“useful” objects, like cars, trains and horses.\n\nMy friends’ homes were as barren of culture as mine with the exception of Artie Edelman and\nBernie Beck, whose parents were better educated and more cultured than mine. I must have\npicked up some appreciation of music and art from them. When I went to sleep away camp,\nespecially as a junior counselor, I also came in contact with music and art through the “rich”\nManhattan kids who had attended the expensive camp as paying campers and were now junior\ncounselors. Several of them, who became my friends, had been exposed to culture through their\nmore sophisticated Jewish parents.\n\nNone of these peripheral contacts with culture fully explains my transition from a home barren of\nbooks, records and posters, to my home as an adult that is filled with books, music, paintings,\nsculpture and historical objects.\"\n\nNor does it explain why none of my three children, who were brought up in my home, have any\nreal passion for the classical arts. They are by no means uncultured. They love popular music,\nfilms, current fiction, theater and gourmet food. But they don’t have the same passion for\nclassical music or fine art that I have. By mentioning this difference, I don’t mean to be a snob,\nbut for someone who strongly believes in the power of nurture, exposure and experience, this\ngenerational skip poses a dilemma. Reaction is, of course, one sort of experience, and my passion\nmay well have been a reaction to my parents, as my childrens’ lack of passion for what moves me\nso deeply may be a reaction to their parents. So be it.\n\nThe family values that shape my upbringing focused on modern Orthodox Judaism, religious\nZionism, political liberalism of the sort represented by FDR, Anti-Nazism, Anti-Communism,\nopposition to all kinds of discrimination, support for freedom of speech, a hatred of McCarthyism,\nopposition to the death penalty, a commitment to self defense and defense of family and\ncommunity, a strong sense of patriotism, and a desire to be as truly American as was consistent\nwith not assimilating and losing our traditions and heritage.\n\nMy father, who was a physically strong but rather meek man, wanted me to be “a tough Jew”\nwho always “fought back.” He urged me to never let “them” get away with “it.” By them he\nmeant anti-Semites, and by it, he meant pushing Jews around. He taught me to box and wrestle\nand insisted that I never “tattle” on my friends, regardless of the consequences to me.\n\nOne of my father’s brother’s was a man named Yitzchak, who we called Itchie. It had nothing to\ndo with any skin condition. One day my Uncle Itchie took me to a Brooklyn Dodger baseball\n\n\" Finding Jefferson\n\n20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017107",
