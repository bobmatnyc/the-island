Case # 08-2432, Beachfront Vista Property, Nightingale Beach Club Association\nViolation of Chapter 134, Section 134-1472 (3) of the Town of Palm Beach Code\nof Ordinances, no additional walls, fences, hedges or other structures or growth\nshall be erected or be grown eastwardly of Ocean Boulevard to a height greater\nthan four (4) feet above the surface of the Ocean Boulevard.\n\n(Ms. Duemler recused herself as part of a previously declared conflict and Mr.\nHoffman advised Mr. Vanneck would be a voting member in this case)\n\nLead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said Nightingale Beach Club had\npreviously been found in violation and were given time to obtain a permit. A\npermit had been obtained but there were some conditions attached to it. There\nhave been two (2) inspections with the Florida Wildlife Commission and an\nagreement was reached to not require the vegetation to be trimmed until after\nturtle season. Since they have already been found in non-compliance, the Town\nrecommends the time fro compliance be extended to November 7, 2008 and if\ncompliance is not achieved by that date, a fine of $250.00 a day be imposed.\n\nJack Maxey, 244 Nightingale Trail, presented some documents to the Board and\nadvised he was president of the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association. He said\none of the documents was his application under duress for the permit. Mr. Maxey\nadvised he had not been sworn in and was administered the oath of office by\nRecording Secretary Houston.\n\nMr. Maxey said he has had a long correspondence with the legal department of the\nDepartment of Environmental Protection and he believes on an emotional level,\nthey do not believe the trees should come down but they told him they could not\nfind any statutory way to force the Town not to enforce the permit. They told him\nit should be the jurisdiction of a court, not the DEP. Mr. Maxey said the Town\nwas cutting down its own sea grapes in violation of the permitting process. Mr.\nMaxey said he had all kinds of burdens in this permit that he needed to comply\nwith, one of which was replacement of the whole plant if anything over 6 feet\nwhich was larger than 3 inches in diameter was cut down. He said he was\nsupposed to provide a signature on the document putting himself at risk of a\n$10,000 a day fine if he did not comply with the requirements of the permit. Mr.\nMaxey said Jean Higgins, a biologist for the State Fish & Wildlife, recommended\nsea grapes should not be trimmed because they are the best source of protection\nagainst the lighting. Ms. Higgins made some suggestions such as changing light\nfixtures and extinguishing lights during turtle season and maintaining a substantial\nhealthy vegetation light blocking buffer.\n\n13\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016586",
