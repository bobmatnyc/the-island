  "text": "Epstein’s wealth, but gets no closer to an answer, beyond confirming her\nown sense of dubiousness.\n\nEpstein, sensing that he might be exposing himself, tried to stop the\nprocess (Ward, well known for offering an operatic view about her reporting\nexploits, says he threatened her), called Carter and said he was having\nsecond thoughts about being a public figure.\n\n“Then you should live in a two bedroom apartment in Queens,”\nresponded Carter.\n\nAnd then the troubles began.\n\nEpstein, in man-who-can-have-everything fashion, has, for many\nyears, ordered up a daily massage following his workout sessions.\n\n“Often these were massage massages,” says Epstein matter of factly,\n“but sometimes these were happy ending massages, especially in Palm\nBeach, where there are many massage parlors—‘Jack Shacks,’ they’re\ncalled—that do outcalls. There was no sex. An often there was no happy\nending. Often I would be on the phone for the entire massage. There were\nhowever a lot of massages and a lot of girls, with one girl recommending\nothers.”\n\nIt is after Epstein’s round of publicity and widely touted association\nwith Clinton, that the mother of one of the massage parlor girls who went to\nEpstein’s house (most of the girls return to Epstein’s house many times) calls\nthe police. The police interview the girl, Saige Gonzales, who then supplies\nnames of other girls. Some of whom are found to be younger than 18.\n\nIn the end, the police track down 18 girls—nine who are under 18; the\nothers in their 20s and 30s; one woman is in her 60s—a number of whom\ngive statements describing scenarios not terribly different from Epstein’s\ndescription above, except each is laid out in clinical, lurid, and near-identical\ndetail. A cold and forceful Epstein demands that unwitting juveniles (though\nthey have come here for this very purpose) perform repulsive (or at least\nrepulsively described) acts on him. (Although the nature of the allegations\nwill dramatically grow, nobody at this point alleges that he did anything to\nthem.)\n\nEpstein, tipped to the investigation, vastly raises the stakes, calling\nDershowitz, who flies into Palm Beach to put the local authorities in their\nplace—alienating Palm Beach officialdom—and, doubling down on the\nprofile of the case. Dershowitz brings in Roy Black the famous criminal\nattorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape trial in Palm\nBeach.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022721",
