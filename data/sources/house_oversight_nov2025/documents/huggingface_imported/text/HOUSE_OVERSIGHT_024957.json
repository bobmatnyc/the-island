Our policies and procedures are clear, transparent, and always\nin the end, truth will prevail and will defeat all rumors.\n\nAl Emarat Al Youm:\n\nThe UAE government has taken notable measures in combating corruption, referring\nsenior officials to court. Are there further steps the government intends to undertake in\nthe same regards? And does Your Highness believe that an independent watchdog body\nmight be needed to audit governmental and semi-governmental organizations?\n\nThe UAE has efficient independent watchdog bodies that include the federal State Audit Institution, as well as\nlocal auditing departments. I’ve visited the State Audit Institution lately where I was updated on its activities.\nI’ve given directives to revamp its systems and provide all necessary tools to enhance its performance. Sy\nstems and processes of the Dubai Financial Audit Department are also being reviewed and enhanced. Besides,\nthere are other auditing bodies that operate under the Rulers’ Courts across the seven Emirates.\n\nAl Emarat Al Youm:\n\nYour Highness received His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the\nPresident of the UAE, in Dubai last week, and escorted His Highness on a tour that\nincluded key landmark developments across the Emirate. What was the significance of\nthis visit?\n\nI meet with His Highness Sheikh Khalifa on regular basis. We are companions on our journey of development,\nand he is our Leader and our President. Dubai is his home and he is most welcome at anytime. The visit comes\nin line with His Highness’ ongoing follow up on development efforts across the seven Emirates. He is always\nkeen on meeting his people across the country to listen to their views and ensure their own welfare.\n\nAs a matter of fact, all His Highness visits to Dubai are important. His latest visit was significantly important as\nhe toured Dubai’s new landmarks, expressing his satisfaction at Dubai’s milestone achievements. He was also\nvery keen on visiting “Dar Al Ittihad” (the Union House) where establishment of the United Arab Emirates\nfederation was proclaimed. The visit was in honor of this remarkable achievement.\n\nQuestions by Al Shorouk Egyptian Daily\n\nArab funds, particularly GCC ones, have suffered big investment losses in international\nmarkets due to the global financial crisis. Sovereign Arab funds have also lost a lot of\ntheir money. How did the UAE benefit from this tough lesson, and does it intend to direct\nmore money into Arab markets? Are there any plans to direct part of this money into\n\nEgypt\n\n[Message clipped]\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024957",
