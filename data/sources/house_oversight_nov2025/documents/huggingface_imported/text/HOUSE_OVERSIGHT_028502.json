As per Peggy Siegal’s office, | have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards\nceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City.\n\nThis year’s ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn’t be more thrilled with this year’s impressive\ngroup of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The\nDirector Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the\nIndustry Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn’t be more\npleased to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year’s special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year\nranging from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Blige, this\nyear’s ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028502",
