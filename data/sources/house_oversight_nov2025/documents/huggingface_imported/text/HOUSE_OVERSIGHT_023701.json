The fear is that Xiis ana-\ntionalist, who has set China on an ag-\ngressive course of bullying its neigh-\nbors and confronting the United States.\n\nThe fear seems not unfounded. China\nhas intensified its territorial claims,\nfrom island disputes with Japan to vast\nareas of the South China Sea.\n\nXi frequently inspects People’s Liber-\nation Army forces, especially naval\nfleets, exhorting China’s military to\n“get ready to fight and to win wars”’\nand “to win regional warfare under\nLT.-oriented conditions.”\n\nXi holds China’s top three positions:\nhead of the ruling Communist Party of\nChina, head of state, and, as chairman\nof the Central Military Commission,\nhead of the military. He will likely lead\nChina for a decade.\n\nJust after becoming party chief in late\n2012, Xi announced what would become\nthe hallmark of his administration. ‘“‘The\nChinese Dream,’ he said, is “‘the great\nrejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”\n\nXi’s Chinese Dream is described as\nachieving the ‘““Two 100s”’: the material\ngoal of China becoming a ‘‘moderately\nwell-off society”’ by about 2020, the\n100th anniversary of the Chinese Com-\nmunist Party, and the modernization\ngoal of China becoming a fully de-\nveloped nation by about 2049, the 100th\nanniversary of the People’s Republic.\n\nThe Chinese Dream has four parts:\nStrong China (economically, politically,\ndiplomatically, scientifically, militar-\nily); Civilized China (equity and fair-\nness, rich culture, high morals); Har-\nmonious China (amity among social\nclasses); Beautiful China (healthy en-\nvironment, low pollution).\n\n“A moderately well-off society” is\nwhere all citizens, rural and urban, en-\njoy high standards of living. This in-\ncludes doubling the 2010 G.D.P. per cap-\nita (approaching $10,000 per person) by\nabout 2020 and completing urbanization\n(roughly one billion people, 70 percent\nof China’s population) by about 2030.\n\n“Modernization” means China re-\ngaining its position as a world leader in\nscience and technology as well as in eco-\nnomics and business; the resurgence of\nChinese civilization, culture and mili-\ntary might; and China participating ac-\ntively in all areas of human endeavor.\n\nIf Xi’s nationalism seems at odds\nwith these grand goals, it is not. Here\nare six reasons why:\n\nInternational Herald Cribune\n\nTHE GLOBAL EDITION OF THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\n« Need to consolidate power. Xi was not\nselected by Deng Xiaoping, the archi-\ntect of reform, as were his predecessors\n(Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao), and he\nwas not elected by the people. Conven-\ntional wisdom had it that Xi would be a\nweak leader. In order to realize his\nChinese Dream, Xi needs to assert\nstrength and assure control. So far, he\nhas exceeded expectations.\n\n« Need to enable reform. Xi and Premier\nLi Keqiang are determined to enact far-\nreaching economic reforms, the most\nextensive in 15 years, but there is stiff\nresistance from those whose domi-\nnance would be diminished and bene-\nfits cut (such as state-owned enter-\nprises with ties to party power).\n\nThis resistance can no longer be\ncouched credibly in terms of ideology,\nso it appeals to nationalistic aspirations\nby accusing reformers of ‘worshipping\nWestern ways,” “glorifying Western\nmodels” or ‘‘caving in to Western pres-\nsures,”’ Xi’s proactive nationalism is a\nstrategy of ‘‘offense is the best de-\nfense’’ — an inoculation, as it were,\nagainst the political virus of being\nlabeled ‘‘soft’’ or “pro-Western.”\n\nReformers in China are generally as-\nsociated with pro-American attitudes\nand thus subject to fierce public crit-\nicism. By establishing himself as a na-\ntionalist operating independently of the\nUnited States (his first foreign trip was\nto Russia), Xiis able to secure econom-\nicreforms by distinguishing them from\nserving Western/American interests.\n\n* Need to legitimze one-party rule. To\nperpetuate its rule (which China’s top\nleaders truly believe is essential for the\nwell-being of the country), the Chinese\nCommunist Party has constructed a\ngrand narrative that is founded on\nthree critical claims: Only the Commu-\nnist Party can continue to improve cit-\nizen’s standard of living (and amelior-\nate severe social and economic\ndisparities); only the party can main-\ntain a stable, unified country and con-\nstruct a happy, harmonious society;\nand only the party can effect the ‘“‘reju-\nvenation of the Chinese nation,” which\nstresses a firm command of ‘‘core in-\nterests’’ (i.e., sovereignty and territori-\nality) and increasing global respect.\n\n* Maintain stability through unity.\nChina faces numerous internal ten-\nsions, especially a class-divided popu-\nlace (rich-poor, urban-rural, coastal-in-\nland) that have erupted within one\ngeneration. Moreover, an increasingly\ncomplex society can fracture along mul-\ntiple fault lines. Pollution, corruption,\nhealthcare, housing, migrant workers,\nworkers’ wages, social cynicism, chan-\nging values, among other raging issues,\n\nEDITORIAL OPINION\n\nthreaten to tragment society — and all\nare exacerbated by an energetic social\nmedia. Only nationalism, which reson-\nates intrinsically and passionately\nacross Chinese society, can provide suf-\nficiently strong social glue.\n\n© Differentiate from predecessors. Top\nChinese leaders must combine historic-\nal continuity with their own distin-\nguishing theories and practices. How\nshall Xi fare?\n\nEconomic growth rates must decline,\nand a host of domestic tensions (or\ncrises) are coming his way, such as\npublic anger at corruption and resis-\ntance to pollution. Hence another ra-\ntionale for nationalism.\n\nIn the past, nationalistic surges were\ntriggered largely by external events\n(such as NATO's accidental bombing of\nthe Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in\n1999). Xiis putting nationalism at the\ncore of his leadership — his nationalism\nis proactive, riding the high road of pa-\ntriotism and pride.\n\n* Personal beliefs. Xi has deep-seated\npatriotic convictions, the product of\nfamily, life and career. His father, Xi\nZhongxun, was a founder of the new\nChina and a leading reformer under\nDeng Xiaoping. In 2006, when Xi Jin-\nping was party secretary of Zhejiang\nProvince, he told me about Chinese\npride and patriotism as motivating\nChina’s historic resurgence — words\nremarkably similar to his recent pro-\nnouncements.\n\nSo is Xiareformer? A nationalist?\nThe answer is that he is both, because\nonly by being a nationalist can he be a\nreformer. American policy makers must\nunderstand Xi’s nationalism so that\nwhen the reigning superpower meets\nthe rising superpower, both can benefit.\n\nROBERT LAWRENCE KUHN is an international\ninvestment banker and the author, most\nrecently, of ‘How China's Leaders Think:\nThe Inside Story of China's Reform and\nWhat This Means for the Future.”\n\nGLOBAL VIEWPOINT/TRIBUNE MEDIA SERVICES\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023701",
