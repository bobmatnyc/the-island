A detailed review by a team of BuzzFeed News reporters of \nmore than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and \nfederal court found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are \nexaggerated at best; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject — \nthemselves never suggest that Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that \nmany of the most lurid insinuations have been floated without any visible support from verifiable information. \nWhile it's still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving \nEpstein, the fact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should \nnot be encouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst. \nOne sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been \nmarkedly vague on details. \nWhen asked to present actual proof, Jack Scarola, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing \ndocuments that have come to light in recent weeks, warned darkly in an email of \"extortionate threats, power, wealth or political \npressure.\" \n\"The time will come when all your questions will be answered,\" said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in \nPalm Beach County Court. \"But that time is not now.\" \nUnwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the Atlantic have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish \nof Epstein's \"black book,\" which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every \nother powerful figure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier's private 727 aircraft that \nfrequently capture Bubba at 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein's \nsex slave as a teenager and whose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on \"Orgy Island\" in 2002 to participate in a \nsexual romp, possibly with women who were not yet of age. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022697 \nYORK & 'ORGY ISLAND,' SAYS TEEN SEX SLAVE \nView this image \nNational Enquirer \nTellingly, many of those articles — which have notably increased in tempo in recent weeks following Roberts' late December \naccusation that noted attorney Alan Dershowitz was one of the men she was forced to have sex with — contain language \nunderscoring the fact that none of this proves anything. \"It should at this stage be stressed that the Mail has no evidence to \ncorroborate this and other claims made by Virginia Roberts,\" the Daily Mailwrote in April. \"Though her LinkedIn page claims a \ncertificate in Swedish massage, there is no evidence that she ever actually treated Epstein to one,\" Gawker (in the \nstraightforward and clearest reporting on the documents to date) wrote last week. And the National Enquirer did not appear to \nrely on the court record for its conclusions, instead to the interpretation of an unnamed source who noted that \"Bill's name is all \nover the legal papers, which are chock-full of sordid claims.\" \nClinton's discretion on matters of sexual restraint has attained permanent notoriety, so maybe it's natural to assume that particular \nleopard doesn't change his spots. But at this point, there is simply nothing to back those sordid claims up. \nHere's what we do know: \nJeffrey Epstein is a secretive billionaire financier and Democratic donor who says he never attended college but whose \n\"background is in physics.\" He owns properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, London, and Paris and also owns an island in \nthe U.S. Virgin Islands. He has at least two private jets, including the 727. \nHe has known Bill Clinton since about 1995, and his relationship with him grew stronger after he left office. There is no question \nthey were friendly. Epstein's so-called \"black book,\" which is less like something out of the Heidi Fleiss affair and more what most \npeople would call a \"phone directory,\" contains 21 numbers for getting in touch with Clinton, as well as emails and addresses. \nBut that 92-page directory also contains exactly the range of eye-poppingly famous and powerful contacts one might expect of an \nincredibly rich, connected person who owns Manhattan's largest private residence, from Tony Blair to Elie Wiesel to Courtney \nLove. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022698 \nEpstein was long rumored to be a sexual libertine; \"It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do,\" real estate \npersonality Donald Trump once said of his old friend. \"And many of them are on the younger side.\" \n1 \nFlorida Dept of Law Enforcement \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022699 \n04; \nfoit \nP4C \nP44[ \n441 \nIMPORTANT MESSAGE \n70F4 \n-)ATE a TIME U PM \nPA e 6647 \nOF \nPHONE/ Cy( ,...74sx Iva, \u000bMOBILE \nTELEPHONED \t(r-- \tpLu$e CALL \nCAME TO SEE YOU \tVALL CALL AGAIN \nWANTS TO SEE YOU \tRUSH \nRETURNED YOUR COLL \tSPECIAL ATTENTION \t. \ntie ho. a leuche, \ntux lo leacili yti, \n1101- 417 -•.-c,LA V' Li-s(dia n. \nShe Is ;-,- \u000b_ (i\" (yr Q./ \nci-sle \n/ee ci yol., i \nawe hic/e.r., (ry au \nit. \nPalm Beach County Court \nEpstein, in his Florida sex offender photo; at right, a phone message to Epstein from a modeling agent offering Russian lessons \nfrom a \"2x8\" year old girl. \nIn 2006, that reputation caught up with him, when he was arrested by the Palm Beach Police on charges of sexually molesting \nnumerous underage girls. Police reports in the court record show that detectives found Epstein regularly paid very young women \nto give him massages that he turned into sexual encounters. He allegedly had a preference for very young women, whom he \ncarefully groomed into increasingly extreme situations, including what some, including Roberts, allege to be sexual slavery. \nIn total, 40 women were identified as possible victims of sexual abuse by Epstein, many of them teenagers at the time, including \nsome younger than 14 years old. Epstein was originally charged with a variety of crimes, including sexual assault, rape, and \nwitness tampering. \nHe avoided most of those charges as well as federal prosecution in late 2007 by agreeing to plead guilty in Florida court, a deal \nthat Dershowitz, who was one of Epstein's lawyers, helped negotiate along with an all-star legal lineup that interestingly also \nincluded famed Clinton-hunter Ken Starr. \nIn the end, Epstein got 18 months in prison for a single count of soliciting an underage prostitute, of which he served 13 months. \nHe is now a registered sex offender who lists his primary residence as the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nIn a pleading late last month in federal court, attorneys for Roberts allege that \"Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a \nprovision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution.\" Dershowitz has denied these charges vigorously, \ncalling them \"salacious and false\" and, possibly more importantly, \"completely irrelevant\" in a Jan. 12 filing. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022700 \nDespite what some called among the most exhaustive investigations in Palm Beach Police history — which dug up such evidence \nas an Amazon receipt for Epstein's purchase of titles including \"Training With Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Exotic Slaves and \nTheir Owners\" — there is nothing in the police record suggesting any other men were involved in Epstein's predatory behavior. \nR.4%...?..if. • VtP4' . 411011If \n' \nJefirti Epstein .1,1 \n354 El Elt41, W \nPat= 13ea. \nUSA - \n*Aka. \nXI-44a \nYour oilier of. \nC•ty Item \n-;••••45-. \n, . • \n-r7-• \nII \n11 \n• \ntbr453704/ -3.4mm/2436223 SORTEAtfastTrac \n- - - \nI:ter 4,2005 (Order ID 103-1727020-4509648) \n-Shippin; Address: \nhefty .F.paieet \n358 El Sao I.S'ay \nPaIrri Beach.

One firm bringing some of those cases employed a young lawyer named Bradley \nEdwards, who managed some of the cases. In 2009, a founding partner at the firm, Scott Rothstein, fled the country before \nultimately returning to plead guilty of running a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme built around recruiting investors to buy stakes in \nlitigation settlements that turned out to be phony. \nAs details of the fraud emerged, Epstein sued Rothstein and Edwards in Palm Beach County Court for racketeering, alleging, \namong other things, that they dangled Bill Clinton's association with Epstein as a lure to investors, implying that settlements would \nbe fast and sizable. Epstein ultimately dropped his suit in 2012, but by that time, Edwards had countersued for malicious \nprosecution and abuse of process. \n, along with a claim by Virginia Roberts against the federal government over the 2007 prosecution deal in district court \n(which she filed as a \"Jane Doe\" in 2008), are still pending and are the source of most of the scant information about Clinton that \nhas appeared. Scarola, who in the past sued Chiquit over payments to violent leftist Colombian rebels and won a $1.45 billion \nverdict over Morgan Stanley (that was later overturned), is the lawyer bringing the suit in county court in West Palm Beach, while \nPaul Cassell, a former federal judge known for his critical take on mandatory-minimum sentences, mans the federal case four \nblocks away. \nNeither Cassell nor Edwards responded to requests for comment. \nIt is primarily from pleadings in those cases that the press has been getting a glimpse inside the lifestyle of Epstein, and, by \nextension, Clinton. \"Edwards had sound legal basis for believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022701 \ninformation,\" part of one pleading reads. Roberts, in her case, alleges that Epstein forced her \"to be sexually exploited by \nDefendant's adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal \nacquaintances,\" which, Edwards elsewhere claims, are \"categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into.\" \nPolice reports entered into the record go into stomach-wrenching detail about Epstein's alleged exploits with the girls and women \nhe recruited and paid for massages that became sexual acts, and mention other women participating as well. Epstein's longtime \nfriend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, is accused of taking part, while his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, is described procuring \nyoung woman for him. \nBut neither of those women has ever said a word about Clinton being involved. Maxwell, for her part, has never been deposed. \nShe canceled a deposition in 2010, claiming she had to return to England indefinitely due to family illness, but was soon thereafter \nphotographed by Us Weekly at Chelsea Clinton's wedding in Rhinebeck, New York. \n..4 \nView this image \nUs Weekly \nThe father of \nthe bride \"was \nnodding Hs head \nat guests, but \nyou could tell he \nwas nervous,\" \nsays a source. \nFrom the bling to bi \npart was prepped \n. • \nThe Venue \nFive hundred guests convent \nWhite—designed, century-o' \nmansion in Rhinebeck for th \nAwaiting out-of -towners? 1z \nfull of goodies including Cher \nFor her part, Kellen, who won immunity from prosecution along with Epstein in 2007, did sit for a deposition, but repeatedly \npleaded the Fifth, refusing to even say if she'd ever even met the former president. \nEpstein's much-discussed flight logs show fairly conclusively that she has. \nA review of the handwritten documents shows Clinton taking 13 trips in Epstein's specially outfitted Boeing 727, including a much-\ndiscussed trip to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. In every single instance, the logs show, Kellen was also on the plane, \nas was Epstein. That may sound suspicious, except for the fact that Kellen has been described as Epstein's right hand, profoundly \ninvolved in his professional activities as well as personal ones. Indeed, Doug Band, Clinton's personal aide, was on all but one of \nthe flights the former president took on Epstein's jet. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022702 \n1,1 kiikri—\nel-cra \nKIT() VOW 1Y \n'‘) AN) I-) 2.6—S-2_ \n2G S2.

The logs also show him flying with former advisor Ira Magaziner, ex-Transportation \nSecretary Rodney Slater, and fashion model Naomi Campbell. \nThe pilots' documents also leave numerous and — understandably — intriguing questions unanswered: Clinton was on four flights \nwith women identified as only \"Janice\" and \"Jessica,\" who have not been identified; he once flew with a person identified only as \n\"one female\" and also, during part of the trip throughout Africa, a young woman named Chauntae Davies, who appears in \nEpstein's phone directly under the massage category and whose expertise in Swedish massage was described in Gawkey's story \nmentioning her last week. And because the entries are hand-written in a very cramped log form, it's impossible to know if \nimportant names ended up illegible or left out altogether, nor if there are other logs that have not been revealed. \nBut based on what's in the court files, there are no further clues about those flights, other than the testimony and public \nstatements of Roberts, who has described the airplane as a kind of high-altitude Gomorrah. What is on the record is a deposition \nof Larry Visoski, one of Epstein's former pilots, who recalls having Clinton on his plane as many as 20 times. When asked, \"Do you \nremember him being on the airplane with younger girls?\" Visoski replies, simply, \"No.\" \nClinton flew literally around the world with Epstein, traveling from New York to London, to Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, \nMorocco, Portugal, Russia, and throughout Africa. In almost every case, according to cross-referenced information on his speaking \nengagements, Clinton was apparently traveling for professional reasons, and, according to the logs, he never flew with his wealthy \nfriend anywhere near the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nThat does little to bolster statements by Roberts, who in a 2011 conversation with her lawyers (which both New York Posts Page \nSixand Radar Online described as an \"interview\") claimed Clinton traveled to Epstein's infamous retreat on Little St. James Island \nin 2002. \nEarlier this month, it was reported that Roberts is writing a \"tell-all\" memoir about her experiences. In a sworn affidavit filed in \ncourt last week, she claimed to have had sex with Epstein, Dershowitz, England's Prince Andrew, and several other men on \nnumerous occasions, and portrayed a three-year period ending in 2002 when Epstein passed her off to his friends continually. But, \nshe added, \"I have never had sexual relations with Clinton, nor have I claimed to have had such relations. \nhave sexual relations with anyone.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022703 \n!WU 1111C 41 LI til dtifitri CleVJytumg CIV4-7dUbC LEI( Win HUFF !nevem 1UIIff II1IJId.T dULLW. \n53. lia.ve seen reports saying or implying that I had sex with former President Bill \nClinton on Little Saint James Island.

In fact, the logs show \nall of Clinton's flights came in 2002 and 2003, with not a single appearance aloft recorded in 2004 or 2005. \nThe closest potential link to Clinton in the period closer to Epstein's fall, the public record suggests, comes from one of his \nlongtime confidants, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. \nThe flight logs indicate Summers flew on Epstein's jet as far back as 1998, but also on April 15, 2004, September 14, 2005, and \nDecember 21, 2005. The final trip came 10 days after Summers got married, and the log for the flight — from Bedford, \nMassachusetts, to the Virgin Islands — shows what appears to be his new bride on board, as well as Ghislaine Maxwell, but not \nEpstein. \nj1/4/410-1-11-.. \t_SCR \teco \twit \t- , ...... \u000bGm Lv \n2.1  \tt,  \tt 1 \t64.--D \tT ).ST \t*., \n& pAt L.:4fmk? .44.44Fr sv.kow.;e11..,V \nView this image \nPalm Beach County Court \nEpstein was a significant donor to Harvard University, of which Summers was president at the time. According to a spokesperson \nfor Summers, on a few occasions when Epstein was flying to where Summers was also traveling, he accepted rides on the \nbillionaire's jet. \nAttorneys in the two cases have attempted to get the court to permit discovery from Clinton himself, but have been stymied by \nmotions from Epstein's lawyers. Court records show they have also tried unsuccessfully to depose Donald Trump, former New \nMexico Gov. Bill Richardson, former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, and magician David Copperfield. Notably, a list of 73 \nproposed witnesses in Roberts' trial does not include Clinton. \nThe tale of Epstein and his sexual activities is undoubtedly a fascinating, and harrowing, one. But with the star witness in one case \nswearing under oath that she has no such evidence, and everyone else in a position to know keeping their mouths firmly shut, it is \nat this point extremely difficult to draw even a hazy, crooked, dotted line between Epstein's depredations, in the bedroom or aloft, \nand William Jefferson Clinton. \nBuzzFeed News reporters Alex Campbell, Kyle Blaine, and Megan Apper contributed to this report. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022704 \nKathryn H.
