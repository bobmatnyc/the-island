  "text": "to mind. \"I guess there's no reason you would know this,\" she'd said, \"but it's fairly\ncommon for people to have one person who's their lover, and a separate person for\ninflicting pain.”\n\nI thought about that, and about Richard saying, \"A lot of crap comes out when you do this\nstuff.\" I considered the maxims that tell us that the opposite of love isn't actually hate,\nand how much time I'd spent encouraging myself to hate him. Finally, I admitted that the\nonly term I had to cover this depth of emotion was \"love\"... but that couldn't make it feel\nlike the right word. Then again, it wasn't exactly \"hate\", either.\n\nHe was a demon, an idol. He hardly felt like a person to me.\n\nI didn't vocalize any of this. Coming back from the waterfront, we arrived at the\nintersection where Richard would go to his apartment and I'd return to mine. An awkward\npause ensued: I was leaving in a few days, and wouldn't be alone with him again.\nWatching him, I wondered if he was thinking about asking me over, or was looking for\nan excuse not to. I looked away.\n\n\"Goodnight,\" I said. Walking home, I wished I felt strong.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nIt was after I left Chicago that I really started piecing myself back together. My anger\ndrained away quickly, as if an infected wound had been lanced. Perhaps I found my\nstrength under the scab. I figured that maybe all this did identify something about my\npersonality, but it didn't tell the whole story. Even now, I could be independent, rational,\nand feminist, with self-esteem and integrity. Right? Right.\n\nIt was impossible to deny that the desires were real -- and when I allowed myself to focus\non them, I didn't try. Ruminating on my past, I recalled heart-twisting details that put\neverything in a certain compelling context. It wasn't just the man who'd gone after me in\n2003. Wincing, I remembered childhood fantasies: I'd compulsively written and drawn\nbrutal dreams until, at some confused middle-school point, their horror came home to me\nand I recoiled. In those long-repressed fictions of slavery and pain, I recognized my\nnewly-acknowledged desires.\n\nOne conversation I'd had with an early boyfriend rang in my head. \"There's a dark current\ninside me,\" I'd told him. Self-consciously, I'd averted my eyes at my own melodrama. \"I\ndon't know how to be with you, when I feel it.\" I hadn't exactly been trying to leave him,\nbut I'd needed something more.\n\nThe last dream I remember of Richard didn't involve any pain at all: he just kissed me.\nAwakening, I felt a melancholy pang. Richard invested a lot of self-conception in being a\nsadist, and he was so distant -- I couldn't imagine relating to him as a lover. And I knew\nour relationship (such as it was) would never have started without BDSM as a focus.\nPrevious to that night at the outdoor party, he'd hardly registered on my romantic radar,\nand we had little in common in terms of how we dealt with relationships.\n\nStill, for a moment I wished -- unreasonably, I knew -- that I could have fallen\nstraightforwardly in love.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018455",
