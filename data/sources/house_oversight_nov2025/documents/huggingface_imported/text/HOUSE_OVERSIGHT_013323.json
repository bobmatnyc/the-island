At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact\nbetieve that, more specifically, Epstein's attorneys knew of Epstein's scheme to recruit minors for\nSex and also knew that these minors had civil actions that they could bring against him. In fact,\nthere was much communication between Epstein's attorneys and the United States Prosecutors in\na jgint attempt to minimize Epstein's civil exposure.
