  "text": "July 1, now less than 36 hours away. Having moved the passengers off the plane\nto one of the terminal buildings, they were threatening to start killing them\nunless we freed a list of 53 Palestinians and PLO supporters, forty of them held\nin Israel and the rest in a number of European countries, and paid a ransom of\nfive million dollars.\n\nWell past midnight, we started looking at our options. One which seemed —\nbriefly — to hold promise drew on suggestions from Ido Ambar and Mookie.\nIdo’s almost rhapsodic description of the capabilities of our C-130 Hercules\ntransport planes convinced us we could parachute in a Sayeret Matkal team, as\nwell as vehicles for them to use on the ground. Mookie and I agreed that to\nensure surprise, we would disguise the commandos as Ugandan troops, in\n“Ugandan” Jeeps. The final twist came with the arrival of the reserve air force\nofficer who had been on training duty in Entebbe. He brought a reel of 8mm\nfilm from an official ceremony at the airport. At the start, a Ugandan army\ngeneral could be seen arriving in a black Mercedes. “That’s it!” Mookie said.\n“The Mercedes. Every top Ugandan military officer has one.” We decided to\nswap one of our Jeeps for a jet-black limousine.\n\nYet by daybreak on Wednesday, when I went up to brief Motto, we'd set\naside the option of a parachute drop. Any initial surprise would be outweighed\nby the risk of exposure from the very start of the assault. We’d also gone cold\non a second option, to infiltrate sayeret teams along the shore of Lake Victoria\nfrom across the nearby border in Kenya. I doubted we had enough time to\nnavigate all the operational and diplomatic obstacles before the deadline\nexpired. That left option three: having the SEALs, along with a core team from\nthe sayeret, parachute onto Lake Victoria with rubber dinghies and attack the\nairport from on foot. We arranged to do a test parachute assault off the Israeli\ncoast in Haifa later in the day, but if that went well, it seemed the only practical\nalternative.\n\nMotta and I went met Peres around 8:30am. Shimon had no first-hand\nmilitary experience, having played a political role alongside Ben-Gurion from\nIsrael’s early years. So he was not really interested in the details. But he was\nkeen to hear our assurances that a military option did exist. He was even more\nintrigued when we were joined by the head of the air force, Benny Peled.\nUnaware of the airborne parachute drop we had been discussing overnight,\nPeled suggested something far more ambitious. Rather than using a single\nHercules, he proposed using four of the giant transport planes to ferry in a larger\nforce, some 200 men in all, land them on one of the runways and take over the\n\n168\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028016",
