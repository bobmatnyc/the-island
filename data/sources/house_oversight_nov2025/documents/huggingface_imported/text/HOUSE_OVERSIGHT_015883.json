You could go on\nforever, generating rules to cover every\neventuality.\n\nClearly, in the fuzzy world of\nhuman endeavor, truth and rules often\npart company. Yet, we all assume math-\nematics is free of such uncertainty. Let\nme tell you this is not so.

My introduction to it came about from a chance\naccident. I became ill in my first year at University (mononucleosis,\notherwise know as glandular fever, if youre curious) and was eventu-\nally sent home to recover. Lying in bed for two months is boring. So\nto pass the time my mother suggested I read Bertrand Russell's, The\nHistory of Western Philosophy. | think she figured I had plenty of time, so\npicked a thick book. This nearly 800-page tome charts the entire history\nof philosophy from the time of the ancient Greeks. I presumed Russell\nwas a philosophy professor, but he was originally a mathematician. He\nwas a mathematician. And because he lived and worked productively for\nalmost all of his 97 years, spanning much of the 19\" and 20\" centuries,\nhe crops up repeatedly as a central figure in many areas of intellectual life.\nRussell the politician, Russell the philosopher, Russell the mathematician\nand Russell the peace campaigner are all the same man — not, as I had\nincorrectly first guessed, a prolific family. In his early career, Bertrand\nRussell was a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, working on a broad\nrange of mathematical problems. Meanwhile, in Germany, his contem-\nporary David Hilbert, also a polymath, held the chair of mathematics at\nGottingen University. Both men shared a common objective: to tidy up\nthe loose ends in mathematics and set down the rules once and for all.\nThis movement was called Formalism.\n\nKurt Gédel\n\nFormalism\n\nDavid Hilbert and Bertrand Russell believed you should be able to set\nout all the rules of mathematics even though it might be a complicated\naffair. Without contradiction or inconsistency you should be able to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015883",
