  "text": "Millions of Americans have come to rely on Medicare and Medicaid — and spending has\nskyrocketed, to 21% of USA Inc.’s total expenses (or $724B) in F2010, up from 5% forty\nyears ago.\n\nTogether, Medicaid and Medicare — the programs providing health insurance to low-income\nhouseholds and the elderly, respectively — now account for 35% of total healthcare spending in\nthe USA. Since their creation in 1965, both programs have expanded markedly. Medicaid now\nserves 16% of all Americans, compared with 2% at its inception; Medicare now serves 15% of\nthe population, up from 10% in 1966. As more Americans receive benefits and as healthcare\ncosts continue to outstrip GDP growth, total spending for the two entitlement programs is\naccelerating. Over the last decade alone, Medicaid spending has doubled in real terms, with\ntotal program costs running at $273 billion in F2010. Over the last 43 years, real Medicare\nspending per beneficiary has risen 25 times, driving program costs well (10x) above original\nprojections. In fact, Medicare spending exceeded related revenues by $272 billion last year.\n\nAmid the rancor about government’s role in healthcare spending, one fact is undeniable:\ngovernment spending on healthcare now consumes 8.2% of GDP, compared with just\n1.3% fifty years ago.\n\nTotal Government* Healthcare Spending Increases are Staggering —\n\nUp 7x as % of GDP Over Five Decades vs. Education Spending Only Up 0.6x\n\nUSA Total Government Healthcare vs. Education Spending as % of GDP, 1960 — 2009\n\nerms\n\n8%\n\n65 enema neeinnumuoninenienison ng Al gece\n\n6 gpa Ermer\n\nSpending as % of GDP\n\n——Total Government (Federal + State + Local} Spending on Healthcare\n\n\\ ’ ——Total Government (Federal + State + Local} Spending on Education\n\nYo oot\n1960 1964 1968 1972 1976 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008\n\nNote: “Total government spending on heaithcare includes Medicare, Medicaid and other programs such as federa/\n\nemployee and veteran health benefits, total government spending on education includes spending on pre-primary through\n\nKP tertiary education programs.
