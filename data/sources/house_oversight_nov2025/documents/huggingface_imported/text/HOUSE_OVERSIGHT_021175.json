What was really cool about it though, was you could see through\nthe mesh and watch fish swimming underneath.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon we spent by the pool reading magazines and\neating fruit plates. Eventually he went to his cabana to have a nap later\non. That night after dinner and my mixed cocktail of Xanax and red wine,\nI asked if he’d like another massage before I went to bed. He just wanted\nto stay up watching movies in Jeffrey’s theatre room. As peculiar as that\nrequest was to me I didn’t argue it, I just hoped I hadn’t disappointed him\nin any way that could make it back to Jeffrey. | showed him how to use\nthe remote and turn off the T.V when he was finished before going to\nbed. The next morning we were both catching a flight from St. Thomas\nand we had no time for anything other than breakfast and packing, which\nsaved me from having to be too polite as we said our good-bye’s from the\nterminal in the airport, both hurriedly off in separate directions,\nthankfully. I arrived back in Palm Beach, only to be told to catch another\nflight the next day to N.Y.C, where Jeffrey would fix me up the money he\nowed me for treating his colleague out to an entertaining weekend.\n\nChapter 10\n\nI was fixed up more than what | had usually made for two days, which\nwas great because that car I had been saving for was finally within my\nreach. I had been waiting for the freedom a car gives every teenager for a\nlong time, and now that I had over fifteen thousand dollars saved up I\ncould pretty much afford to go buy myself a nice car outright. Looking\nmuch better than the last time I saw him Jeffrey acknowledged it. I went\nto his office where he was waiting for me and he had a guest with him.\nShe was unusual looking to the common stereotype drop dead gorgeous\ngirls Jeffrey had normally introduced me to. Of Asian decent, her name\nwas Rena. Jeffrey had met her at an art gallery where some of her own\nartwork was on display. She had a bubbly persona about her and I could\nthen understand why Jeffrey liked her so much, she fit into the\nsubservient category that he liked his girls to fall under. It was apparent\nto me that they had already slept together in the short time span they had\nmet, as there closeness was oddly noticeable and | wondered what it was\nhe was offering to her in exchange for her body. I found out later from\nJeffrey that he was buying her artwork, promising her the world as an\nartist, telling her he’d have her work in the all the museums in N.Y.C and\nthe best art exhibits. Everyone was promised something, and seemed to\nbe bought off in someway or another to be in his company. It was only a\nmatter of time that the truth would come out.\n\n61\n\n£1 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFREO04 194\n\nTo my own amazement Rena was to be assisting me in Jeffrey’s\nmassage this day, not being a total knockout or anything spectacular,\nlooks wise that is, but for some reason he seemed intrigued enough. As\nwe made our way through his spectacular mansion she was in total awe at\nevery corner. Commenting on the present artwork and décor that we\npassed in every hall, it no longer seemed so grandeur to me anymore but\nhearing someone else speak about it in such excitement reminded me of\nthe days when all of this seemed so unforeseen.\n\nWhen we got to the massage room, or “The Dungeon” as | used to put\nit for it’s medieval looking appearance, we firstly out of custom all hada\nsteam shower, where Jeffrey expected me to walk her through a servants\nduties, telling her to take his other foot and start rubbing in small circles\nand stroking the arches of his foot rhythmically. Rena took the\ninstructions well and began to massage him too. When we all went to the\nshower next and she followed in my exact lead washing his body as well.\nJeffrey absolutely loved the fact that two teenage girls were dually\npampering him. Jeffrey wanted to move to the massage bed and I had to\nfurther begin to show her about the body, upon his accord. She mimicked\nmy every move up his legs and buttocks, keeping up with every stroke\nuntil he could not contain his arousal any longer and was already\nrequesting us to start kissing each other, the start of the very reason we\nhad even met in the first place.\n\nHe blatantly stopped the massage nowhere near being complete and\nturned over to announce his increased arousal in a physical abundance of\ngrotesqueness. Moving over to the small couch in the corner of the room\nhe made a space for her to lye me down on the massage table as she had\ncommanded him to do in such a domineering tone that he wasn’t used to\nbeing. spoken down to with. From that very moment onwards and from\nthe look on his face he was yearning for her to orchestrate an hour of\ndeliverance upon my meek nature. He started to stroke his erect manhood\nas he was being tantalized watching her take over every inch of my body\nin a dominating act of seduction. I was left breathless and soar after my\nfirst introduction into the world of S&M.\n\nRena considered herself a dominatrix, she loved bondage, whipping\nhitting, and eventually cutting her sex partner with little sharp knives\nuntil they subdued to her punishment in agonizing pain. She was\nabsolutely crazy if you were to ask me, and I couldn’t help but wonder\nwhat got her into this in the first place. All | knew was that Jeffrey was\nabsurdly taking into the appeal of watching us two interact, often with her\nacting as my mistress who would fondle me with an insurmountable\namount of whips and toys. Then she would love to finish off every\nsession by hitting me across my face with a hard blow from the back of\nher hand and sneering over my curled up body showing Jeffrey her ability\n\n62\n\nD Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFRE004 195,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021175",
