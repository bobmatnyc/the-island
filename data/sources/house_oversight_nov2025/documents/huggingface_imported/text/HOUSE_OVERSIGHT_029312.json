The benefits are\nsubject to an annual maximum and an an-\nnual “use-or-lose” rule.

The Supreme Courts decision\nto strike down DOMA presumably opens\nthe door to same-sex married couples be-\ning able to use FSA dollars for qualified\nmedical expenses of both spouses. The IRS\n\nis expected to issue guidance.\n\nCOMMENT. A cafeteria plan may not\nallow an employee to request salary re-\nduction contributions for a health FSA in\nexcess of $2,500 for plan years beginning\nafter December 31, 2012.\n\nHealth Savings Accounts. A health savings\naccount (HSA) is a vehicle that eligible tax-\npayers can use to pay for or reimburse quali-\nfied medical expenses. Contributions to\nan HSA are tax-deductible (employer con-\ntributions are excluded from gross income)\nand distributions are tax-free if used to pay\nfor qualified medical expenses. To be an eli-\ngible taxpayer, the individual, among other\nrequirements, must be covered by a high-de-\nductible health plan (HDHP), not enrolled\nin Medicare, not claimed as a dependent on\nanother taxpayer's return. Qualified medi-\ncal expenses are those incurred by, among\nothers, the taxpayer and his or her spouse.\nBecause of DOMA, only opposite-sex mar-\nried couples could HSA dollars for a spouse’s\nqualified medical expenses.\n\nIMPACT. With DOMA being struck\ndown by the Supreme Court, same-sex\nmarried couples will presumably be able\nto use HSA dollars for qualified medical\nexpenses of both spouses.\n\nCOBRA/FMLA. Federal law requires that\ncertain employers offer continuation of health\ncare coverage to employees, their spouses,\n\nCCH Tax Briefing\n\nand families (“COBRA coverage’). Current\nfederal laws related to COBRA coverage do\nnot apply to same-sex married couples. The\nDOMA definition of spouse precludes the\nextension of Family and Medical Leave Act\n(FMLA) leave benefits to opposite-sex part-\nners. After the Supreme Court’s decision in\nWindsor, these rights presumably would now\nbe available to same-sex spouses.\n\n“The IRS is expected\n\nto provide guidance on\nthe timing of employee\nbenefit plan amendments,\n\nincluding the issue of\nwhether benefits need to\nbe made retroactive or\nonly prospective.”\n\nRetirement Plans. The Internal Rev-\nenue Code provides extensive protections\nfor the spouse of an employee to share in\nthe employee’s retirement benefits payable\nthrough Code Sec. 401(k) plans and other\nqualified plans. These protections would\npresumably now apply to the same-sex\nspouse of an employee.\n\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct, signed into law by President Obama\nin 2010, set in motion a host of changes to\nthe delivery of health care and health insur-\nance coverage. Some of the changes already\nin place affect health savings accounts (dis-\ncussed above in this Briefing). Other chang-\nes are scheduled to take effect after 2013.\n\nIndividual Mandate And Penalty. Be-\nginning in 2014, the Affordable Care Act\nimposes a penalty on individuals who do\nnot carry minimum essential health cov-\nerage for one or more months, subject\nto certain exceptions. Married taxpayers\nwho file a joint return are jointly liable\n\nfor any penalty that may be imposed\nupon either spouse. The penalty does not\napply in certain cases, such as in the case\nof individuals whose household incomes\nare below their filing thresholds. Now\nthat DOMA has been struck down, same-\nsex married couples presumably will be\ntreated in the same manner as opposite-\nsex married couples for purposes of the\nindividual mandate and its penalty.\n\nCOMMENT. The Affordable Care Act pro-\nhibits the IRS from using liens or levies to\ncollect any unpaid penalty. The IRS cannot\nlevy on the property of one spouse to satisfy\nan unpaid penalty of the other spouse.\n\nPremium Assistance Tax Credit. Beginning\nin 2014, the Code Sec. 36B premium assis-\ntance tax credit is scheduled to be available\nto those qualified individuals and families\nwho are not offered minimum essential cov-\nerage and as a result obtain coverage through\na health benefit exchange. The Affordable\nCare Act provides for advance payment of\nthe credit. Taxpayers who are married at the\nend of the tax year must file a joint return\nBecause DOMA has\n\nbeen struck down, same-sex married couples\n\nto claim the credit.\n\nwill presumably need to file a joint return to\nclaim the credit.\n\nCode Sec. 45R Credit. For tax years 2010\nthrough 2013, eligible employers may claim\na credit of 35 percent of health insurance\npremiums paid (25 percent for small tax-\nexempt employers). In tax years beginning\nafter 2013, an employer must participate in\nan insurance exchange in order to claim the\ncredit. The credit is scheduled to increase\nto 50 percent for small business employers\n(35 percent for small tax-exempt employers)\nafter 2013 (but will terminate after 2015).\nCertain family members are not treated as\nemployees for purposes of the credit. Un-\nder DOMA, these restrictions did not apply\nto same-sex married couples because their\nmarriages were not recognized for federal\npurposes. With DOMA’s demise, a same-\nsex spouse who satisfies any of these criteria\nwould presumably not be treated as an em-\nployee for purposes of the credit.\n\n©2013 CCH Incorporated.
