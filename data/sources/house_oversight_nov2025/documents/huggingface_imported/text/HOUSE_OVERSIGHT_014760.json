  "text": "Own FX vs rates vol: cheapen USD call with rates strangle\n\nWe like owning USD calls against selling US rates vol. In particular, we recommend\nbuying a EURUSD 3m 1.05 put for US$100 pips (off 1.0730 spot), partially\nfinanced with the sale of US$100mn 150bp-wide 3m30y strangle (sold at\nUSS$600k).\n\nWhile potential fiscal stimulus has already been priced into rates term premia and rates\nvolatility to some extent, it is not sufficiently priced into the FX market, in our view:\n\n« Rates skew in gamma on long-tails has moved decisively for payers, while EURUSD\nskew is just beginning to price in higher US rates (Chart 59}. This suggests to us\nthat the market may already be partially protected against higher rates in the long-\nend, such that a further selloff may not see as strong a rally in gamma on long-tails.\n\ne On the other hand, a further rally in the USD may catch investors under positioned\nand result in greater volatility in the currency markets.\n\n¢ Aprincipal component analysis of rates (US, EUR and JPY) and FX vols highlight that\nUS rates vols and USDJPY vol are expensive, while 3m10Oy vol in EUR and JPY are\ncheap, along with EURUSD vol (Chart 60). While the cheapness of 3m10y vol in EUR\nand JPY can be explained by expectations of QE expansion in the two regions, we\nthink that there is value in owning EURUSD vol.\n\nFrom a terminal rates perspective, we are comfortable selling a 150bp-wide strangle for\nthe following reasons:\n\n« We believe the result of the elections are a game-changer for the outlook on the US\neconomy. As such we have probably entered a new regime for US rates whereby we\nare unlikely to retest the historical lows in 30y rates recorded in Aug-16 (1.67%).\nThis suggests little downside in selling an ATM-75bp receiver (1.66% strike).\n\n« Inascenario where US rates sell-off, USD is also likely to strengthen. The positive\ncorrelation between US yields and the USD has returned due to expectations for\nfiscal stimulus boosting economic growth. Furthermore, we would also argue that a\nsubstantial selloff in US rates, accompanied with USD strength may be self-\ndefeating as it would put pressure on emerging markets and risky assets, thereby\nresulting in a flight to quality bid for USTs. The risk is that of large foreign reserve\nselling by EM central banks, putting upward pressure on US rates and downward\npressure on the USD.\n\nChart 54: FX vol just beginning to price impact of higher rates Chart 55: Residual of FX and rates volatilities based on a ly PCA (*)\nFx Option BofA-Implied Volatility and USD Swaption-Normal Implied 8\n4\n6\n244 4\n2.04 2\n144\nee 2 0\n12 a 2\n4\n045\n6\ngs F FS SF FS SF GF HS\ncoil!
