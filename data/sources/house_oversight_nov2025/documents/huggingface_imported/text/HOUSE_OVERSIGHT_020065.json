  "text": "outcome that a special prosecutor delegated to find a crime would find one—likely many.\nEverybody became a potential agent of implicating others. Dominos would fall. Targets\nwould flip.\n\nPaul Manafort, making a good living in international financial gray areas, his risk\ncalculation based on the long-shot odds that an under-the-radar privateer would ever\nreceive close scrutiny, would now be subjected to microscopic review. His nemesis, Oleg\nDeripaska—still pursuing his $17 million claim against Manafort and himself looking for\nfavorable treatment from federal authorities who had restricted his travel to the United\nStates—was continuing his own deep investigation into Manafort’s Russian and Ukrainian\nbusiness affairs.\n\nTom Barrack, privy to the president’s stream of consciousness as well as his financial\nhistory, was suddenly taking stock of his own exposure. Indeed, all the billionaire friends\nwith whom Trump got on the phone and gossiped and rambled were potential witnesses.\n\nIn the past, administrations forced to deal with a special prosecutor appointed to\ninvestigate and prosecute matters with which the president might have been involved\nusually became consumed by the effort to cope. Their tenure broke into “before” and\n“after” periods—with the “after” period hopelessly bogged down in the soap opera of G-\nman pursuit. Now it looked like the “after” period would be almost the entirety of the\nTrump administration.\n\nThe idea of formal collusion and artful conspiracy—as media and Democrats more or\nless breathlessly believed or hoped had happened between Trump and the Russians—\nseemed unlikely to everybody in the White House. (Bannon’s comment that the Trump\ncampaign was not organized enough to collude with its own state organizations became\neverybody’s favorite talking point—not least because it was true.) But nobody was\nvouching for the side deals and freelance operations and otherwise nothing-burger stuff\nthat was a prosecutor’s daily bread and the likely detritus of the Trump hangers-on. And\neverybody believed that if the investigation moved into the long chain of Trump financial\ntransactions, it would almost certainly reach the Trump family and the Trump White\nHouse.\n\nAnd then there was the president’s insistent claim that he could do something. J can\nfire him, he would say. Indeed, it was another of his repetitive loops: I can fire him. I can\nfire him. Mueller. The idea of a showdown in which the stronger, more determined, more\nintransigent, more damn-the-consequences man prevails was central to Trump’s own\npersonal mythology. He lived in a mano a mano world, one in which if your own\nrespectability and sense of personal dignity were not a paramount issue—if you weren’t\nweak in the sense of needing to seem like a reasonable and respectable person—you had a\nterrific advantage. And if you made it personal, if you believed that when the fight really\nmattered that it was kill or be killed, you were unlikely to meet someone willing to make it\nas personal as you were.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020065",
