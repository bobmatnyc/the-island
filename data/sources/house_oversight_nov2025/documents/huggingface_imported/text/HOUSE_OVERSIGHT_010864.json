Ididn't say must have. I said that that's\ngoing to be evidence of the common scheme and plan, and\nthen, in the absence of, you know, some falling out\nbetween people or somebody becoming, you know, more\nassociated or less associated with a criminal\norganization.

Right.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, counsel. That's the\nreason why I asked you to clarify whether you\nwant to limit this to direct evidence or whether\nyou want all of the evidence including\ncircumstantial evidence, because as we both know,\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n245\n\ncircumstantial evidence is good evidence.

SCAROLA: It doesn't. It doesn’t.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Mr. Cassell, is it your testimony that, from\nMr. Rodriguez's testimony about how often he says\nProfessor Dershowitz visited in a 2004/2005 time frame,\nit's fair to draw an inference about how often he\nvisited in an earlier -- three-year earlier time frame?\n\nA. In the circumstances of this case,\nabsolutely.\n\nQ. And would it be fair to infer from the number\nof times that Donald Trump visited three years later,\nhow often he visited at an earlier period?\n\nA. I did not investigate the circumstances\ninvolving Trump. He wasn't somebody that was coming up.\n\nQ. Were you aware on December 30th of 2014 that\nDonald Trump was quoted in Vanity Fair as saying: \"I've\nknown Jeff\" -- referring to Epstein -- oh, I'm sorry.\n\nIt was a New Yorker Magazine, not Vanity Fair, That he\nwas quoted as saying: \"I've known Jeff\" -~ referring to\nEpstein -- \"for 15 years. Terrific quy. And he's a fot\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n\n(954) 331-4400\n247\n\nof fun to be with.” It even said that: \"He likes\nbeautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on\nthe younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys the\nsocial ~~ social life\"? Were you aware of that on\nDecember 30th, 2014?\n\nA. Possibly. I mean that sounds vaguely\nfamiliar. Trump has just not been somebody that -- that\nI’ve paid much attention to in this case.\n\nQ. Based on that statement, and the facts we\ndiscussed earlier about Mr. Trump visiting and being a\nfriend, and the other circumstances we discussed, are\nyou suspicious about whether he engaged in sexual\nmisconduct with minors?\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to the\nextent that you can't reveal anything that my\nclient has informed you of,\n\nTHE WITNESS: Right. If we set aside that\ninformation, I'm not -- I'm not suspicious, no,\nnot given the information I have.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Okay. So notwithstanding that his name is\ncircled in the address book, he was a good friend, he\nvisited often, and he was quoted as saying that Jeff was\na terrific guy who liked young women almost as much as\nTrump did, you're not even suspicious?\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\nPage 244 to 247 of 335\n\n24 of 46 sheets\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010864",
