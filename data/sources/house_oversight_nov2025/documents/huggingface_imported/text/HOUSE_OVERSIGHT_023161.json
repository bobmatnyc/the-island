It runs a crooked\ncourse. This work provides a paper trail of the meandering and rocky path of the peace\nprocess. Relevant documents related to the Arab-Israeli conflict over the past century\n(since the Sykes—Picot Agreement of 1916) are compiled in this book. It provides an\nannotated and chronological overview of attempts to make peace in one of the most\ndifficult and protracted conflicts in the world, and it includes a full set of accompanying\nmaps specially made for this edition.\n\nThe sheer volume of such a work raises the critical problem of how to present the\ndocuments in a way that facilitates their accessibility and understanding. A simple\nchronological ordering would miss important connections between the documents,\nwhich are thus better grouped by common theme. To this end, we have divided the\nvolume into five thematic Parts. Part I compiles documents related to the formal peace\nagreements between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as those related to Israel’s\nunilateral disengagement from Gaza. The documents in Part I] relate to the many\ninformal peace proposals and ideas offered over the years that have served to contribute\nto more official processes at a later date. Part III compiles the many important United\nNations documents specifically related to the question of Palestine. Part IV sets the\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue in a broader context, providing regional papers going back a\ncentury, up to the latest documents. Finally, Part V compiles Israeli and Palestinian\ndomestic documents relevant to the quest for peace in the Middle East.\n\nGrouping the documents by theme highlights the evolution of particular aspects of\nthe conflict and the peace process over time. When examined as a group, these\ndocuments provide valuable insights on the events, conditions, and actions that have\nbeen most important in influencing the different phases of the peace process.\n\nFor guidance, the reader will find a chronological overview of all the documents and\nkey events.\n\nON PART I: PEACE AGREEMENTS AND THE\nDISENGAGEMENT FROM GAZA\nNothing about the quest for peace in the Middle East has been simple or easily attained.\nMerely bringing Palestinians and Israelis together was a feat that took decades to\n\nachieve. Despite all the efforts exerted by not only the principal parties, but also local\nactors, regional neighbors, and international players, agreements between the two sides\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023161",
