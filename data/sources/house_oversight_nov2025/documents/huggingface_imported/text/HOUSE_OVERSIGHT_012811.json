The American neuroscientist Michael Platt carried out a clever series of experiments\nto understand how much male rhesus monkeys value different kinds of social information and how much\nthey will pay to obtain it. As in our discussion of wanting and liking, Platt nghtly assumed that rhesus\nmonkeys would value most what they like most, and that they would pay the highest price for what they\nare most motivated to acquire.\n\nEach monkey watched a slide show with viewing options akin to pay-per-view television. Ona\ngiven trial, they could watch one of two images for as long as they liked, each viewing option associated\nwith a particular amount of juice. For each pair of images, one delivered more juice than the other. Given\nthat these were thirsty monkeys , they should prefer more juice over less juice. If monkeys have no\ninterest in the images per se — because they have no value — then their viewing preferences should be\nstrictly determined by where they can get the most juice. If, on the other hand, the images have value,\nand some images are more valuable than others, then they may be willing to look at an image that delivers\nless juice over an image that delivers more. This is costly viewing. This is paying for watching.\nEvidence for such preferences would reveal that rhesus monkeys value the social information that comes\nfrom the image over the juice itself, a surprising result given that juice is a primary reward whereas the\nimage is only a secondary reward, indicative of things to come.\n\nConsistently, these male monkeys had two favorite channels, preferring those showing pictures of\nhigh ranking individuals and close-ups of female hindquarters. They preferred these over images of low\nranking individuals, despite the fact that this choice often cost them the opportunity to drink more juice.\n\nPlatt's findings show that monkeys are motivated to acquire information about socially relevant\nsituations, including information about dominance and sex. Their motivation or desire to obtain this\ninformation is high, as evidenced by the fact that they are willing to pay acost. Keeping an eye ona\ndominant is of value as dominants pose a threat, especially one staring at you. Keeping an eye on a\nfemale’s hindquarters is also of value as it can signal sexual receptivity: in rhesus monkeys, as in many\nother monkeys and apes, the area around the vagina either swells, turns red, or both when females are\novulating. This is important information for males in their attempts to court and mate females. I will\nquickly pass over the potential implication of these results for thinking about the origins of pornography.\n\nHumans also value social information, with many hours in a day devoted to obtaining such\ninformation through gossip. Many of us live in a world where dominance matters, whether it is climbing\nto the top of a corporate chain or attaining the title of heavyweight champion of the world. Individuals\nseek high status because of the physical and health benefits that accrue. In such societies, our sense of\nself is based on our comparison with others. It is also based on a strong sense of independence,\n\nautonomy, assertiveness, and uniqueness. In other societies, the self dissolves into the other, with an\n\nHauser Chapter 2.
