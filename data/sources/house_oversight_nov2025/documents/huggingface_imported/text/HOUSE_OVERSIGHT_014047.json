United States, a federal case in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida, usefully illustrates the issue.*° In that case, the\nU.S. Attomey’s Office for the Southern District of Florida developed\nconsiderable evidence that Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire with extensive\npolitical and social connections,*! had sexually molested more than thirty\nyoung girls between 2001 and 2007 at his West Palm Beach mansion.“\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office entered into contentious plea negotiations with\nEpstein over how the case should be resolved. The prosecutors initially\nsought a resolution that would have required Epstein to plead guilty to at\nleast a felony sex offense. After pressure from Epstein, for reasons that\nhave never been clearly explained,** the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed to\nenter into a nonprosecution agreement. Under the agreement, the U.S.\nAttorney’s Office agreed not to prosecute him and, in exchange, Epstein\nagreed to plead guilty to two state felonies for soliciting prostitution with a\nminor. After entering those guilty pleas, Epstein was sentenced to only\neighteen months in state jail.+ No federal charges were ever filed and\n\n4° Does v. United States, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337 (S.D. Fla. 2011). In the interest of full\ndisclosure, two of the authors of this Article (Cassell and Edwards) are co-counsel for the\nvictims in this case. The statement of the facts in this Article draws heavily on the victims’\nallegations as they have detailed in their pending motion for summary judgment in the case.\nSee Jane Doe #1 & Jane Doe #2’s Motion for Finding of Violations of the Crime Victims’\nRights Act and Request for a Hearing on Appropriate Remedies at 3-23, Does, 817 F. Supp.\n2d 1337 (No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM) [hereinafter Jane Doe Motion] (providing fifty-three\nproposed facts in the case). The U.S. Attorney’s Office has generally disputed some of these\nallegations without offering specifics as to what happened. See, e.g., United States’\nResponse to Jane Doe #1 & Jane Doe #2’s Motion for Finding of Violations of the Crime\nVictim Rights Act and Request for a Hearing on Appropriate Remedies at 34-43, Does, 817\nF. Supp. 2d 1337 (No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM) [hereinafter United States’ Response]. As of\nthis writing, Epstein has declined to intervene in the case to dispute the allegations.\n\n4l See, e.g., Paul Harris, Prince Andrew’s Link to Sex Offender Jeffrey Epstein Taints\nRoyalty in US, GUARDIAN (Mar. 12, 2011), http://goo.gl/Ol4vAE; Landon Thomas Jr., Jeffrey\nEpstein: International Moneyman of Mystery, N.Y.
