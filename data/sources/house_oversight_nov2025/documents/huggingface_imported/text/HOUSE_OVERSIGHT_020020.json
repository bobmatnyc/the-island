Joseph\nDunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to the White House press office,\nKushner was “traveling on behalf of the president to express the president’s support and\ncommitment to the government of Iraq and U.S. personnel currently engaged in the\ncampaign.” Kushner, otherwise a remote and clammed-up media presence, was copiously\nphotographed throughout the trip.\n\nBannon, watching one of the many television screens that provided a constant\nbackground in the West Wing, glimpsed Kushner wearing a headset while flying in a\nhelicopter over Baghdad. To no one in particular, recalling a foolish and callow George W.\nBush in flight gear on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln proclaiming the end of the\nIraq War, he intoned, “Mission accomplished.”\n\nGritting his teeth, Bannon saw the structure of the White House moving in the exact\nopposite direction from Trumpism-Bannonism. But even now, he was certain he perceived\nthe real impulses of the administration coming his way. It was Bannon, stoic and resolute,\nthe great if unheralded warrior, who, at least in his own mind, was destined to save the\nnation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020020",
