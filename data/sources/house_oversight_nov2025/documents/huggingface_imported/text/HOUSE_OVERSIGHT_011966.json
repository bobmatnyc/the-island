And that is something that I will\nnot answer. And I said never because even when\npeoples come and ask me I will always say the truth\nregarding that.\n\nI know Mr. Brunel for the longest --\nmaybe eight years. And I always said what I know.\nI never saw and I never knew that he did anything.\n\nSo I know that. And that's the truth.\n\nNever. I never heard anybody accusing Mr. Brunel\nor complaining about Mr. Brunel. Nething.\nQ That means -- that means at any time no\n\nmodel, no minor model came to you and said, you\nknow, “Maritza, look what just happened to me\", that,\n\"something bad happened to me\".\n\nA Maybe a model came and told me, \"Maritza,\nlook what happen to me. I don't have any money,” or\n\"T doen't have a place to live\"™. Or, \"Look, I didn't\nget my ticket\", or whatever.\n\nEXHIBIT H-1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011966",
