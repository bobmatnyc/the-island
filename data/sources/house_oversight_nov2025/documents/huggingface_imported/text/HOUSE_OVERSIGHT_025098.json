They know that\nsocialism leads to disaster, but they believe that capitalism is an activity of hungry\nwolves.\n\nThreats\n\n1. A substantial part of the policy of reconciliation between Obama and Raul Castro\ndepends on the lifting of the embargo. Although there is great pressure from the White\nHouse, and surveys showing that the majority of Americans want the sanctions to end,\nthere are no guarantees that this will be achieved during this presidency. Neither can\none predict what will happen with the relations between the two countries if the next\nelections are won by a Republican candidate. Two of the most prominent ones, Jeb\nBush and Marco Rubio, have criticized President Obama for his new Cuban policy.\n\n2. The repeal of the 1996 Helms-Burton is one of the key requirements for Cuba to be able\nto approach the IDB, the IMF, or the World Bank. Without that credit, which requires\nCuba’s affiliation with these organizations, the Island will have no access to loans to\nrebuild the costly infrastructure that the country needs. It’s a very slow process that will\ntake a great deal of time.\n\n3. Cuba depends in large measures on subsidies from Venezuela, and Chavism is going\nthrough a very bad time, which could end up in its destruction and substitution with a\ngovernment unfavorable to “the Cubans.” The disappearance of Chavism in Venezuela\nwould be an economic and political catastrophe for Cuba. Today the popularity of\nNicolas Maduro is less than 20%.\n\n4. The political stability of the Cuban regime until now has depended on control by Fidel\nand Raul Castro. Fidel just turned 89, and Raul will be 84 in June. With them the\ngeneration of the revolution will come to an end, giving way to younger people, led by\nRaul Castro’s chosen heir, Engineer Miguel Diaz-Canel, who is 55. What’s going to\nhappen then? Could the regime transmit the authority within the Community single-\nparty model without the old leaders who until now have lent shape and sense to the\ngovernment. Will there arise other candidates with uncontrollable ambitions,\npresumably young military men, with the intention of taking command? Nobody knows.\nNevertheless, Cuban history has been bloody when regimes reach their end. They are\nreplaced by violence.\n\n5: It will be very risky to invest in properties confiscated from their legitimate owners\nduring the first years of the revolution. In both the United States and Spain there are\norganizations of those injured who are willing to go to court in defense of their rights,\nand who have hired lawyers to do just that. Originally the victims of the confiscations\nwere North Americans or Spaniards, but over time Cuban-Americans and Hispano-\nCubans have been added. Both the United States Congress and Senate and the Spanish\nParliament have legislators with these origins.\n\n6. What will probably happen will be something similar to the case of Nicaragua.\nNicaraguan exiles, infinitely fewer in number and power than the Cuban-Americans,\nwithout congressmen in Washington with their origins, managed to condition American\naid to the solution of the confiscations they had suffered during the first decade of the\nSandinista government. What’s predictable is that the injured Americans, together with\nthe Cuban-Americans, will manage to halt any American aid or benefit destined for Cuba\nuntil their property is returned to them or they are compensated for them.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025098",
