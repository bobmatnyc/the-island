Europe was believed to be at less risk, although as the flow of refugees from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan \nincreased, that risk has risen. \nThe US and everywhere else were thought to be tertiary targets, subject to opportunistic attacks but \nalmost a distraction to ISIS (cf. Al Qaeda), given its preoccupation with exploitation of Sunni/Shia \ndivisions and goal of regional territorial gains. Remember, ISIS' military leadership largely is drawn from \nSunnis who were a part of Saddam's military; they are motivated by revenge for how they have been treated by the \nShia-dominated post- Saddam Iraqi government.) \nLast week's Metrojet bombing in Egypt, the suicide attacks Thursday in a Shiite neighborhood of \nBeirut, and yesterday atrocities in Paris all demonstrate an unexpected level of sophistication and \neffort. As a result, European countries and the US are likely to see an increase in incidents and threats that harken \nback to Al Qaeda's early agenda or are comparable to the Black September and early Hezbollah attacks of the '70s. \nWhat are the consequences? \n• ISIS can be expected to undertake further spectacular attacks. It has eclipsed AQ in operational capability, \nfinancing, and recruitment. It is not only the wealthiest terror group in history, but one with global reach \nand ambitions. (The Obama Administration's claims that ISIS is contained now look naive, and that \ncharacterization will haunt President Obama and Democrats next year.) \n• Expect a significant uptick in ELI, US, and Russian engagement against ISIS in the Iraq/Syria theater, but \nalso in Europe. The failure to detect this elaborate scheme (no less complex because it was \"low tech\" -- so \nwas 9/11) will prompt European security and intelligence agencies to take a much more intrusive and \nperhaps even confrontational approach both to indigenous Muslim groups and to arriving refugees. While \nthat risks a feed-back loop, the instinct will be to err on the side of immediate results, not impact on \nradicalization as a social challenge. \n• Germany and other ELI nations will have to re-examine their commitments to welcome more refugees from \nthe Middle East, and British opposition to allowing refugees, already strong, will harden. The scale of the \nParis attacks will energize right-wing politics and pressure center-left governments to make threat reduction \na higher priority than humanitarian concerns. \nCD The Scowcroft Group \nWARNING: This document and the information contained herein are intended only for the personal and confidential \nuse of clients of The Scowcroft Group.

There are no indications yet that ISIS has changed its \napproach here. It encourages radicalization and lone wolf attacks but has not mounted direct attacks. But the \nMetrojet bombing has resulted in a stepped up global effort to secure American airlines. So too, targeting of \nAmerican institutions/events — it is unlikely a coincidence that an American band was playing at the site of the largest \ncausalities in Paris -- seems highly probable. This applies equally to American bases and facilities overseas, including \nembassies. \nCD The Scowcroft Group \nWARNING: This document and the information contained herein are intended only for the personal and confidential \nuse of clients of The Scowcroft Group.
