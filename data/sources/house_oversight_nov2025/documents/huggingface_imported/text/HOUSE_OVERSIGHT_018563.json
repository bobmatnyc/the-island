  "text": "small town, you're part of that community. If you go to particular clubs, you're in those\ncommunities. There may be aspects of your identity that could align with a community as\nwell: for example, if you read science fiction there are conventions for that (although of\ncourse, identity communities don't always work for everyone with that identity). These\nare places where your knowledge already makes you powerful... so keep an eye out for\nneeds. (It's also worth considering getting involved in an intentional community. I'm kind\nof psycho about housing co-ops, for example, because they are awesome. I personally am\na member of North American Students of Cooperation, but there are other groups, and\nthere are also independent co-ops that aren't part of larger networks.)\n\nWe live in an unstable and fast-paced age. I don't know how people in most other\ncountries feel, but I know that here in the USA, there is a quite pervasive and quite\njustified anxiety among everyone I know in the middle class. Many of our safety nets are\nevaporating, and it's not at all clear that they will be replaced. But no matter how much\nthe people in power fuck us over, we'll never be totally screwed as long as we're not\nisolated and we talk to each other.\n\nOne of the former members of Jane, a white-haired feminist with such powerful energy\nthat she practically glows through the screen, says in the documentary: \"Don't stay with\npeople who tell you you're crazy and useless. Don't stay where you're weak.\" That's what\nI call an activist click moment: find the other people like you, and organize with them.\nThat applies to feminism, it applies to sexuality, it applies to public health. Go where\nyou're strong and make your people stronger.\n\nTK OK ok\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/03/29/grassroots-organizing-for-feminism-sm-hiv-\nand-everything-else/\n\nThe film Jane: An Abortion Service is available from the distributor Women Make\nMovies:\n\nhttp://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c410.shtml\n\nACTIVISM:\n\n[storytime] Interview with Richard Berkowitz, Star of Sex Positive and\nIcon of Safer Sex Activism\n\nRichard Berkowitz is an interesting guy. He was active in the gay community in the\n1970s and 80s as an S&M sex worker, so he's got plenty of experience with all kinds of\nsexual history. Not only that, but he also wrote the very first safer sex pamphlet ever,\nwhen HIV began storming through the gay community. The pamphlet was called \"How to\nHave Sex in an Epidemic\"; Berkowitz literally wrote it at home on his typewriter and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018563",
