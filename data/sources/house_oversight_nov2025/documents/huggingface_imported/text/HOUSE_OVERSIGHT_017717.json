Rev. 835, #839\n\ninformation is subpoenaed from third parties - such as schools or medical providers - even though victims have compelling\nprivacy interests to protect. ® And the rules do not protect the victim's right to attend trials, despite [*840] victims' long\nhistory of having at least some protected interest in observing trials and other proceedings. ?\n\nOne provision conveniently encapsulates the surprising absence of victims from the rules: Rule 32(d)(2)(B). The drafters of this\nrule '° appear to have been so afraid to utter the word \"victim\" that they did not use the term even when describing the person\nharmed by a crime. Rule 32(d)(2)(B) directs that a presentence report contain \"verified information, stated in a\nnonargumentative style, that assesses the financial, social, psychological, and medical impact on any individual against whom\nthe offense has been committed\". !! The phrasing of this provision is striking for several reasons. It eschews the\nstraightforward term \"victim,\" preferring instead the obscuring phrase “individual against whom the offense has been\ncommitted.\" The provision also uses the responsibility-obscuring passive voice in describing the individual \"against whom\" the\noffense has been committed, leaving the reader to wonder who might have committed that offense (the defendant, perhaps?).\nInterestingly, the provision requires that information about the victim be \"verified.\" Fair enough - until one realizes that the\ndirectly adjacent provision regarding information about the defendant lacks a similar verification requirement. !* Why would\ninformation about the victim need to be verified while information about the defendant would not? Finally, the provision\nrequires that victim information be stated in a \"nonargumentative\" style. Again, the adjacent defendant's provision contains no\nsuch direction. !3 In short, even a rule that seemingly must mention victims - the rule dictating preparation of a presentence\nreport describing the crime - manages to avoid mentioning the word.\n\nB. The Victims' Rights Movement\n\nThat victims are missing from the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure exemplifies their treatment in the modern American\n[*841] criminal justice system. As one commentator has described the situation, the victim is \"seen at best as \"the forgotten\nman! of the system and, at worst, as being twice victimized, the second time by the very system to which he has turned for\njustice.\" '4 The absence of victims conflicts with \"a public sense of justice keen enough that it has found voice in a nationwide\nvictims’ rights movement.\" !°\nThe crime victims’ rights movement developed in the 1970s because of a perceived imbalance in the criminal justice system.\nLed by feminist and civil rights activists, victims’ advocates argued that the criminal justice system had become preoccupied\n\n8 See Fed.

P. 43; discussion infra notes 269-300 and accompanying text.\n\n® To be clear, Congress, not the Advisory Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure, drafted the language of this rule.
