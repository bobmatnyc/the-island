With President Clinton looking on, I steered\nArafat toward the window of the ambassador’s fifth-floor apartment. “Look\ndown,” I said. “Imagine that we each have parachutes, and we’re going to jump\ntogether. But I have my hand on your ripcord, and you are holding mine. To land\nsafely we have to help each other... And if we don’t jump, many, many innocent\npeople who are now walking the streets of Gaza and Ramallah and Hebron, Tel\nAviv and Jerusalem, will die.” Arafat again just nodded, leaving me, and the\nPresident, unsure whether anything I’d said had struck home.\n\nThe true test of that would come only when we got to the stage of negotiations\nwhen the “difficult decisions” could not be evaded. Yet only weeks after I returned\nfrom Oslo, the focus did finally shift to the Syrians. President Assad suddenly\nsignalled his willingness to resume talks without any preconditions — a message he\ndelivered first to my British Labor Party friend Michael Levy, who was visiting\nDamascus as Tony Blair’s roving Mideast envoy, and then to Secretary of State\nMadeleine Albright. Assad said he would send Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-\nSharaa to meet me for initial talks in Washington in December, ahead of a full-\nscale, US-mediated attempt to negotiate peace at the start of the new year.\n\nThe broad terms of a potential deal had long been clear, both to us and the\nSyrians. The danger was always that the process would get derailed, or never really\nget started, due to domestic political opposition. Syria had a tightly state-controlled\nmedia and an intelligence service concerned mainly with crushing any signs of\ndissidence. That meant Assad’s main concern was to ensure broad support, or at\nleast acquiescence, from top military and party figures. In Israel, however, every\nsign of a concession would risk igniting charges that we were “selling out” to\nSyria. The Likud and the political right would obviously denounce the idea of\ngiving up the Golan Heights, even though Bibi had been ready to do just that when\nhe was Prime Minister. But even on the left, there was little enthusiasm for\nreturning the Golan. There were far fewer Israeli settlers there than on the West\nBank, not even 20,000. But most of them, far from being religiously motivated\nideologues, were Labor supporters. And almost no Israel, of any political stripe,\n\n331\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028179",
