  "text": "Depending on the particular behavior\nand interaction in question, behavioral\ncycles of interpersonal entrainment can\nrange from milliseconds to hours.\nIndeed, this kind of interpersonal\nentrainment is a pervasive phenomenon\nnot specific to human social behavior\nalone’,\n\nWhen does synchronized\nclapping occur? The distinctive feature\nof such an event is a convergence\nbetween the neural mechanisms\nunderlying the monitoring of the\nmovement of others and the execution of\none’s own movements. The specific\nfactors responsible for the tipping point\nfrom asynchronous to synchronous\nclapping are not yet known, but\ndescriptively each individual shifts the\ntiming of his or her subsequent clap to\nthe perceived timing of claps by the\nwhole collective. Thus, a continuous\nadjustment process emerges in the form\nof a collective behavior (synchronized\nclapping) to which each individual\ncontributes and no single individual\ncontrols. Such continuous monitoring of\nthe collective rather than individuals\nwithin the collective and the adjustment\nof one’s own movements to synchronize\none’s behavior with that of the collective\nresult in a continuous loop of performing\nthe very same action leading to\ndissolution between self and other and\nthe emergence of an entrained unit. The\nresulting effect is the materialization of a\nsupra-individual behavioral\nphenomenon, namely extended\nbehavioral cycles that are locked\ntogether in time. Although the\nemergence of clapping in unison can be\nregarded as a phenomenon worthy of\nmore detailed understanding, it does not\ninduce in its performers the necessity of\nsearching for an explanation since the\nreadily available account is that the\n\nPage |62\n\nperformance somehow produces\nsynchronous clapping.\n\nThere is preliminary evidence\nthat even with no externally imposed\ndemands prolonged synchronization\nemerges within pairs of people\ninteracting or dyads’. What one finds is\nthat despite individual differences in\nmovements, participants entrain (tap\ntogether in time) rapidly when\nparticipants can perceive the behavior of\nothers’. Extensive research in\ncoordination dynamics has demonstrated\nthat such entrainment does not depend\non the intention to coordinate behavior\n'. 1 Studies have repeatedly shown that\nthere is a spontaneous propensity to\nmimic other people (generally observed\nin dyads). One implication this kind of\nbehavioral synchrony is the emergence\nof affective bonding — such as a feeling\nof rapport — both in the case of mimicry\"\nand between the synchronized partners'”.\nOne might conjecture that positive\nfeelings are even stronger when more\npeople are synchronized.\n\nThe conditions that lead to\nbehavioral synchrony can vary. It is\ninteresting that people may be more\nlikely to experience the dissolution of\nself-other boundaries when\nsynchronization is produced without any\nobvious external director and is\ncontinuous. Prolonged spontaneous and\nunintended entrainment among three or\nmore people may introduce this feeling,\nbecause the emergence of synchrony\ncannot be attributed to a single external\ncause.\n\nConclusions\n\nSocial interaction involving\nextended periods of synchronized\nbehavior are not part of our daily\nexperience, particularly when they\ninvolve more than two people.
