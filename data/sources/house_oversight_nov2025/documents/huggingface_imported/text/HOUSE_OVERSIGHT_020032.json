  "text": "liberal media. That was the program. The more your supporters loved you, the more your\nantagonists hated you. That’s how it was supposed to work. And that’s how it was\nworking.\n\nBut Trump himself was desperately wounded by his treatment in the mainstream\nmedia. He obsessed on every slight until it was overtaken by the next slight. Slights were\nsingled out and replayed again and again, his mood worsening with each replay (he was\nalways rerunning the DVR). Much of the president’s daily conversation was a repetitive\nrundown of what various anchors and hosts had said about him. And he was upset not only\nwhen he was attacked, but when the people around him were attacked. But he did not\ncredit their loyalty, or blame himself or the nature of liberal media for the indignities\nheaped on his staffers; he blamed them and their inability to get good press.\n\nMainstream media’s self-righteousness and contempt for Trump helped provide a\ntsunami of clicks for right-wing media. But an often raging, self-pitying, tormented\npresident had not gotten this memo, or had failed to comprehend it. He was looking for\nmedia love everywhere. In this, Trump quite profoundly seemed unable to distinguish\nbetween his political advantage and his personal needs—he thought emotionally, not\nstrategically.\n\nThe great value of being president, in his view, was that you’re the most famous man in\nthe world, and fame is always venerated and adored by the media. Isn’t it? But,\nconfusingly, Trump was president in large part because of his particular talent, conscious\nor reflexive, to alienate the media, which then turned him into a figure reviled by the\nmedia. This was not a dialectical space that was comfortable for an insecure man.\n\n“For Trump,” noted Ailes, “the media represented power, much more so than politics,\nand he wanted the attention and respect of its most powerful men. Donald and I were\nreally quite good friends for more than 25 years, but he would have preferred to be friends\nwith Murdoch, who thought he was a moron—at least until he became president.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Dinner was set for April 29, the one hundredth day of\nthe Trump administration. The annual dinner, once an insiders’ event, had become an\nopportunity for media organizations to promote themselves by recruiting celebrities—\nmost of whom had nothing to do with journalism or politics—to sit at their tables. This\nhad resulted in a notable Trump humiliation when, in 2011, Barack Obama singled out\nTrump for particular mockery. In Trump lore, this was the insult that pushed him to make\nthe 2016 run.\n\nNot long after the Trump team’s arrival in the White House, the Correspondents’\nDinner became a cause for worry. On a winter afternoon in Kellyanne Conway’s upstairs\nWest Wing office, Conway and Hope Hicks engaged in a pained discussion about what to\ndo.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020032",
