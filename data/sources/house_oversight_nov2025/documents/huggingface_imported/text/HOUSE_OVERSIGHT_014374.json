Our panelists included Lee\nOlesky (co-founder and CEO of Tradeweb), Adam Brown (Head of US Rates\nElectronic Trading at BofAML) and Brian Callahan (Head of US Par Loan Trading\nand the head of Electronic Initiatives for Global Credit and Special Situations at\nBofAML).\n\n= Electronification of fixed Income markets steadily growing; however, lag\nEuropean market. Electronic trading came to fixed income trading in the late\n1990’s as a way of automating transactions (i.e. create a more efficient process\nbetween parties}. Today in the US, the investment grade market is 16-20%\nelectronic, the high yield market is 8% (has doubled over the last few of years), the\ntreasury market (which has been growing steadily over last 10-15yrs) is 80-90% of\nthe actual trade count is electronic. While the electronification of the derivative\nmarket was slower to evolve, recent regulatory reform has accelerated the\nelectronification process (50% today}. That said, while the evolution towards\nelectronification in the US continues to grow, the European bond market is actually\nmore advanced with nearly 50% of the bond market automated (vs. 20% for the\nUS).\n\n= Regardless of possible regulatory relief, electronification may slow but won’t\nend entirely. While a partial repeal or lightening of Dodd-Frank would be a net\npositive for the financial markets, and possibly lower the costs to banks and end-\nusers, Mr. Brown doesn’t see a dramatic effect on the market structure. In other\nwords, regulatory relief may only slow down the electronification progress.\n\n= Electronification within the fixed income market is a modest priority among\nasset managers. Fifty-two percent (52%) of the audience polled believe it to be a\nmodest priority in their own corporate strategy to embrace new\ntechnologies/electronification in fixed income. Mr. Brown was not surprised by the\nresults as many of the asset managers have their own constraints from technology\nfunding to regulatory issues to running the day-to-day business.
