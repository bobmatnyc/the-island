But, Piaget’s stages are\nprobably best viewed as a general interpretive framework rather than a precise scientific theory.\nOur suspicion is that once the empirical science of developmental psychology has progressed\nfurther, it will become clearer how to fit the various data into a broad Piaget-like framework,\nperhaps differing in many details from what Piaget described in his works.\n\nPiaget conceived of child development in four stages, each roughly identified with an age\ngroup, and corresponding closely to the system-theoretic stages mentioned above:\n\ne infantile, corresponding to the automatic stage mentioned above\n\n— Example: Grasping blocks, piling blocks on top of each other, copying words that are\n\nheard\n\n® preoperational and concrete operational, corresponding to the adaptive stage men-\n\ntioned above\n\n— Example: Building complex blocks structures, from imagination and from imitating\nobjects and pictures and based on verbal instructions; verbally describing what has\nbeen constructed\n\ne formal, corresponding to the symbolic stage mentioned above\n\n— Example: Writing detailed instructions in words and diagrams, explaining how to con-\nstruct particular structures out of blocks; figuring out general rules describing which\nsorts of blocks structures are likely to be most stable\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013105",
