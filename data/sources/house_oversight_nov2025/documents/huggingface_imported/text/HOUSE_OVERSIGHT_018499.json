  "text": "positive and feminist messages about sex, my own sexuality remained invisible,\nbewildering and hard to talk about.\n\nWhen I started having sex around my mid-teens, I liked it -- I liked it a lot -- but it\nseemed weirdly lacking. I'd never figured out how to masturbate, so I couldn't show my\npartners how to pleasure me. And although I occasionally suspected that I wanted\nsomething like S&M, I didn't understand how far I wanted to go.\n\nA couple of teenage boyfriends tied me up... but then they acted solicitous and went\ndown on me, which didn't send me over the moon (though it was fun). From this, I\nconcluded that S&M was boring, but the truth is, I hadn't come close to the extremes that\nform my preferences. It was years later that I released my need for agony, tears, bruises\nand blood.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nIll. Frigid\n\nAs I got older and had more sex, my apparent inability to orgasm became the most toxic\nsecret I had. Most of my closest friends didn't know. For a while I thought I must be\n\"frigid,\" and ripped myself apart over the idea that I was a \"frigid bitch,” even though that\nmade no sense. It was ridiculous to conceptualize myself that way -- my sexual desire\nwas undeniable, unavoidable. But I had no other words, no other images or stereotypes,\nthat described a pre-orgasmic woman.\n\nWhen I did tell my friends, it almost never went well. The best-case scenario was a\nconversation with anecdotal fragments: \"I knew a girl,” one friend advised, \"who couldn't\nhave orgasms. Then one day she was tripping, and having sex, and she fell asleep, and\nwhen she woke up she was having an orgasm.”\n\nI also found a book on my father's top shelf, written by a guy who said he could give\n\"any\" girl a squirting orgasm. The author claimed that the key was for the woman to be\ncomfortable. He also claimed that the woman had to not know what he was trying to do.\nIn fact, the book explicitly recommended that men prevent their girlfriends from reading\nit.\n\nNeedless to say, it was hard to extrapolate a Unified Orgasm Theory from these tales.\nThe only things that seemed clear were that I somehow needed to both \"let go\" and to\n\"keep trying.” But how?\n\nEvery once in a while I made the mistake of telling someone who was convinced they\nknew the answer -- which was: sleep with them. When I got drunk with one sexually\nexperienced male friend and asked for advice, he insisted that if I'd just fuck him I'd be\nsure to come. \"Anytime you want,” he slurred, \"I'll give you an orgasm. Guaranteed!\"\nThe fact that I was not attracted to him was, in his view, unimportant.\n\nWorse was my lesbian female friend who declared that I had \"issues.\" She said that I\nought to sleep with a woman. Ultimately, she turned out to be right that the problem was\none of sexual identity, but she was wrong that I was a repressed bisexual. Her campaign\nto get me to sleep with her ended in a threesome with a guy I had a crush on. I liked bits\nof that evening, but most of it was boring -- if not distasteful.
