  "text": "idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in\nthe office. a little man , using your power, to appear larger . Eileen was self aware enough to know she\nwas over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- 3\nmillion in deductions Im told were taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out they cannot\nbe used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they said\nthat is the only real question you were focused on ! \" were they deducted \" not -\" is there a benefit \" !!\n\nI asked for the balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your\nfinancials. \"sorry we never got one?\" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing!, a construction\nproject run amok , no budget, the coo fired after only 3 months. , no clue . fyi artspace financials are\nalso a total mess. ( no receivables ??). when i asked for a list of what got done and did not, i received the\nemail from Brad basicailly mind you own business. so much was promised. !!!\n\nAs in your words probably your closest friend and in order to turn the page. I hope the following to be\n\nconstructive\n\nHere is alist of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me .\n\nisuggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain\na paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their importance. THe Phaidon transaction\npapered and structured as contemplated DOES NOT WORK , its as simple as that. DOES NOT !! I\nsuggest again that you re-do bank loans. no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as\nRichard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up.\npay | million a year for executor role. get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, .\nreview amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some\nmoney to kids let them make decisions. , decide art division with children in attendance . have fire drill\ndone on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said\nthe only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., A\nstrategy of the use of art should be implemented. . you have tax consultants it consultants. plane\noperation consultant. . boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation , deal with TRA ,\nBRH, rationalize investments. cash flow. reporting, gaming disclosures. foreign, gift. . prepare tax\nprojections for 15 and 16, . deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed. art partnership, pledges. sell\nstock , art, deal with phaidon debt. athene,? income , capital , foreign , exit, corporate, insurance regs, out\nand inbound issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends.\ncorporate tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, I still think you\nmight consider a Rothshcild bank transaction they have 150b and a distribution network with no\nproducts , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service. deal with UK visa issue sooner rather\nthan later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , complex 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?!\n\nthe facts as i see them\n\nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only after weeks, when\nyou delayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I\nfully understand ) . you unilaterally changed changed our agreement... 5m would be reserved for the\nfuture ? . and out of the remaining 15m ,? i would receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident that both\nthe debt , and the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining\nroom ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that\nI am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when strategies are implemented . you may\nrecall that you appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that 1 would go back on my word\" I\nsaid no , of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large,\npeople tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay\n\nI included in this letter the email i sent to you on April 15, the day 1 was examining your returns It laid\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023227",
