But opponents attracted enough votes to make the\noutcome seem less like the predictable landslides of the authoritarian\norder. Those who objected to the content of the amendments and,\nmore forcefully, to the process by which they were written and the\npolitical sequence they implied marshaled forceful arguments,\ncampaigned hard, and then lost.\n\nAs a consequence, Egypt’s transition process will likely rush forward.\nWhat are the next steps? The basic sequence of events is clear, but\nthe ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) has not\nrevealed many of the details. Nor has it shared decision-making\npower over the sequence and rules in any serious way.\n\nThe amended articles — most of them governing presidential and\nparliamentary elections — are now clearly in effect. But the rest of\nEgypt’s Constitution remains suspended. Egypt’s military rulers have\nsuggested that they will very shortly issue a declaration indicating\nhow authority will be exercised while Egypt’s Parliament and\npresident are elected, which parts of the 1971 Constitution will be\nbrought back into effect, and what their own role will be.\n\nThe committee that drafted the amendments also prepared\namendments to various laws in order to bring them into conformance\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030046",
