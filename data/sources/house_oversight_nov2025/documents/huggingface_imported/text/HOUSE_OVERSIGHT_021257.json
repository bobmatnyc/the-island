All of the\nperspectives discussed in this\nbook have been transformed\nthrough this process.\n\nBackground\n\nIn pursuing the tandem lines of\ninquiry of science and the humanities,\nthe Network itself serves as an example\nof the human capacities and emergent\nprocesses that can derive from collective\nsocial structures and actions. In the\nchapters to follow, the Network\nexamines the nature and power of\nunseen forces ranging from human co-\nregulation to physiological effects of\nspiritual beliefs. The exchanges across\ndisciplinary perspectives suggest that the\n“dominion of the solitary individual” is\ninsufficient to understand the human\nmind or to optimize human health and\nwell being. To understand human nature\nand the human mind, one may need to\nappreciate human needs and capabilities\nthat have not been given due attention.\n\nHomo sapiens are a social\nspecies, which means there are emergent\norganizations beyond individuals that\ncontribute to the ability of our species to\nsurvive, reproduce, and care for our\noffspring sufficiently long that they too\nsurvive to reproduce. As a consequence,\nevolutionary forces have sculpted neural,\nhormonal, and genetic mechanisms that\nsupport these social structures. Among\nthe possible consequences explored in\nthis book are that: 1) people are not the\nentirely self-interested, short-term\nthinking, rational decision makers\nassumed by the mythical creature, Homo\neconomicus, and 2) some of the\namorphous dissatisfaction and chronic\ndiseases that characterize contemporary\nsociety may be, in part, the consequence\nof the denial of the differences between\n\nPage |1l\n\nthe nature of these two beings. Existing\nscientific studies of religion have\nestablished the pervasiveness of\nreligious beliefs and practices and an\nassociation between these beliefs or\npractices and physical as well as mental\nhealth. Religious beliefs and practices\nhave also contributed to failures to heed\nlife-saving medical advice and to the\nhorrendous treatment of others. It will\nbe through the serious investigation of\nsuch beliefs and practices, not through\ntheir denial, that we may ultimately be\nable to identify which aspects of these\nbeliefs and practices are beneficial, for\nwhat individuals and in what contexts,\nand through what specific mechanisms.\n\nRecent research has made it\npatently clear that William James (1890,\np. 442, 2) underestimated the faculties of\nhuman infants when he suggested that\ntheir first sensory experiences were a\n“blooming, buzzing confusion.” But\nwhat James’ sentiment did capture is the\noverwhelming complexity and\nuncertainty that exists in the child’s\nenvironment, and the inherent difficulty\nin making sense of that complexity from\nscratch. Our drive to make meaning is\nirrepressible---and when we do not\nunderstand the forces that drive our\nactions, we invent narratives that make\nthese invisible forces feel more\npredictable and understandable even if\nonly in hindsight. But we do not do it\nalone.\n\nAdults as well as children must\nexplain the uncertainty and ambiguity of\nnatural phenomena (calamities of\nweather, death and reproduction) as well\nas social phenomena (human agents) in\norder to operate effectively. But not all\nactions are perceived as being\nequivalent. Forces operating on objects\nto compel action, as when gravity causes\nrocks to slide down a mountain, are\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021257",
