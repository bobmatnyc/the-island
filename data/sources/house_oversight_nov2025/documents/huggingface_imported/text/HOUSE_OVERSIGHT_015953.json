  "text": "Software 263\n\nit. Find another, create a work-around, and so on. By doing this, we are\neffectively mechanically generalizing our solution. This is forbidden as\nit breaks the Turing limit, so we can’t mechanically solve a general logic\nproblem above the logic limit. We need instead to use intuitive or creative\nthought. In our panic we did not stop, take a step back and engage our\nbrain. Instead, we attempted, unsuccessfully, to blindly hack our way\nthrough the problem.\n\nIf we eventually succeeded in perfecting the code this way, we\nwould have broken a fundamental law of the Universe. Something nasty\nwould have to happen to prevent it, such as rupturing the space-time\ncontinuum or an event equally horrible! Luckily something prevents this\nand keeps our Universe intact - BUGS! Bugs stop us breaking Turing’s\nlimit.\n\nThe next time you curse a bug, remember if they didn’t exist youd be\nin danger of causing a logical paradox. There is no problem in redefining\nthe domain and then creatively producing an all-encompassing design,\nbut, you can’t patch and hack your way there. This theory of bugs leads to\nan explanation for some modern programming rules of thumb.\n\nWritten specifications are valuable because they force you to lay out\nthe whole problem. You don't need to be detailed regarding the depth,\nbut should be expansive about the breadth, covering all the logical\ncomplexity. This might result in many details as a by-product, but a\nspecification needs to delineate the edges of the problem space and not\nsimply focus on a few key points.\n\nWriting the tests for the software in advance is helpful as it is likely\nto tell you early whether your design encompasses the whole problem\nspace.\n\nAlso, building a prototype, throwing it away, and then building the\nreal thing can help greatly. It may be the only way to examine the edges\nof the problem space in detail. Armed with a full understanding, you\ncan then imagine solutions to the complete problem in a single creative\nsitting. Whatever techniques you use to improve the quality of your\nsoftware, remember you are engaged in a creative process that is not,\nitself, open to automation.\n\nThe Art of Programming\n\nProgramming is an art: a creative endeavor. It is also, of course, highly\nscientific. When you work with a good programmer — and I have been\nfortunate to work with some of the best in the world — they all follow\na similar process. First they talk with you at length about your needs\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015953",
