However, it is\nthe inherent speculative and unstable nature of domestic capital flight that we\ncharacterize as ugly flows that poses the greatest risk to the central bank.\n\nRegressions and scenario implications for EM FX\n\nWe used a simple regression to quantify the impact of the RMB depreciation on key EM\nFX: BRL, RUB, INR, TRY, and ZAR'. We analyzed two cases: 1) Base case —- USD/CNY rises\nto 7.25 and market volatility, which we use the VIX as a proxy, is unchanged from its\ncurrent level; 2) Risk case - USD/CNY rises to 8.00 and intense RMB depreciation\nexpectations cause market volatility to rise by three standard deviations. We find:\n\ne The most vulnerable currencies to RMB depreciation are ZAR, RUB and TRY (Chart\n58). The impact of RMB depreciation on BRL and INR is small. This is probably due\nto stronger idiosyncratic factors for BRL and INR in recent years.\n\n¢ Anincrease in market volatility associated with USD/CNY rising to 8.00 would raise\nthe depreciation of EM FX by 1ppt (BRL)-11ppt(ZAR) relative to our 7.25 baseline.\n\n« In our base case of USD/CNY rising to 7.25 by end-2017, the market is overpricing\ndepreciation pressures from the RMB on EM currencies. This partly reflects other\nfactors have more sway over market expectations at the time of writing, such as\nimplications of the US elections outcome.\n\ne Inour risk case of USD/CNY rising to 8.00 and high volatility, there is room for\nadditional depreciation in the ZAR and RUB (Chart 58).\n\nChart 58: EM FX sensitivity to RMB and market volatility Chart 59: Scenario analysis of EM FX against market pricing\n5\n0\n5\n-10 a a a Oo\n-10 45\n15 20 a\n20 ZAR RUB TRY BRL INR\nZAR RUB TRY BRL INR WForecast change vs SDR, % (Volatile markets and USD/CNY at 8.00)\nm Forecast change vs SDR, % (Volatile markets and USD/CNY at 8.00) (Forecast change vs SDR, % (Same volatility and USD/CNY at 7.25)\n= Forecast change vs SDR, % (Same volatility and USD/CNY at 7.25) Forward implied change by end-2017, %\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nCan bond and equity inflows save the day? Not in the near term\n\nGiven the problematic issue of capital outflows and limited efficacy of moderate capital\nflows, another solution could be to attract more foreign portfolio inflows into China’s\nsizable bond and equity markets. More favorable investment policies geared to overseas\ninvestors investing in China’s interbank bond market reveal a clear policy intention to\nopen up China’s financial market. As a result, expectations are rising for China to be\nincluded in global bond indices. However, the following key obstacles for index inclusion\nremain, although reasons vary depending on the index: 1) lack of full accessibility:\ncurrently qualified investors only include medium and long-term investors while hedge\nfunds are excluded; 2) insufficient clarification on requirements of fund remittance; 3)\nlack of clarification on tax issues; 4) lack of accessibility to onshore FX/rates hedging\ntools. Back from our 2016 China Conference, we believe allowing foreign private\ninvestors to access onshore repo, onshore FX swap and forwards would be the next\nsteps to follow.\n\n\" Our dependent variable is the weekly changes of SDR/EM; our independent variables are the weekly changes in the\nSDR/EUR, SDR/CNY, SDR/USD and the VIX index, and a constant. Natural logarithms were taken for all variables and our\nsample period is Jan’14-Nov’16, when the start of the RMB depreciation trend. We base our currencies against the SDR\nto define their value (See Assessing China’s Exchange Rate Regime, Frankel and Wei (2007) for a detailed explanation.).\nTo compute the forecast change in each currency, we use our global FX forecasts to obtain our independent variables.\n\n34 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 Bankof America\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014764",
