  "text": "For real neurobiological data, a time series and its n time delays are first\nreconstructed as a trajectory in an n+1 dimensional geometric embedding space\nand, following partition of that geometric space into n+1 dimensional lettered boxes\n(the choice of partition being a sensitive step), what was once an orbit has become\na sequence of symbols. Dynamical systems in geometric space become symbolic\ndynamics in sequence space. It was Kolmogoroff (1958) who first applied\nShannon’s ideas of entropy and information (Shannon and Weaver, 1949; Khinchin,\n1957) to the quantification of these dynamical system’s telegraphic messages as\n\ndiscrete, “stochastic” (random, probabilistic) output. Kolmogoroff turned to Shannon\n\nentropy, -S'p, log p, (where p = 1/n and n = number of possibilities) to decide the\n\nquestion whether a dynamical system that naturally partitioned into a two or three\nbox system per unit time had the same entropy. His answer was no, that —3(1/3 In\n(1/3)) = 1.098 > -2(1/2 In (1/2) = 0.6931 loge and in computer relevant logz, 1.5850 >\n1.0 (Kolmogorov, 1959). Entropy increases with possibility.\n\nNonlinear differential equations representing brain-relevant expanding\ndynamical systems replace Shannon’s linguistically weighted and serially ordered,\nMarkoff-dependent random number generator of probabilistic language. As noted\nabove, in the case of the Sharkovskii sequences (Sharkovskii, 1964; Metropolis et\nal, 1973; Misiurewicz, 1995), a small change in the single parameter of an entire\nclass of single maximum maps generating motions that are coded from their\nposition at the left or right of center of the unit interval, alters and determines\nprecisely the periodic output such as {1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1...) of its binary\n\nmessage. In higher dimensional examples such as the Rossler and Lorenz\nsystems, one can visualize the joint actions of 24(+) and A(-) moving the trajectory\nso as to both enter, “create,” new boxes and generate new letters as well as visit old\nones, unstable fixed points, thus forming unstable periodic orbits. The latter, one of\nthree diagnostic features of chaotic attractors (see above), can also be seen as\nresulting from the “coarse-grained” imprecision of real world neurobiological\nmeasurement such that two points that are brought close to attractive-repelling\n\npoints are, within measurement error, recorded as having the same value.\n\n240\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013740",
