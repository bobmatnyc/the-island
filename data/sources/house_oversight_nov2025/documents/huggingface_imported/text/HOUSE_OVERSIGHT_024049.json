  "text": "The Fund Managers expect this combination of positive market conditions to remain favorable\nfor generating attractive returns in the biopharmaceutical sector for the foreseeable future.\nAlthough industry returns have been characterized by inconsistency and generally associated\nwith long timelines, a small number of top investors have been able to consistently build\nportfolios that outperform the venture capital industry and relevant public market indices.\nThere is no substitute for experience in this sector, and the New Leaf team brings one of the\nmost powerful and proven combinations of team, strategy, and track record to investing in this\ndynamic sector, and is positioned well for continued success in NLV-III.\n\nINFORMATION CONVERGENCE INVESTMENT STRATEGY\n\nThe Fund Managers believe that U.S. is rapidly approaching a fiscal crisis that will be driven\nlargely by rising healthcare expenditures and the exponential increase in future healthcare\nliabilities. This looming threat is a major driver behind Information Convergence (“I.C.”), the\nsecond of the two primary focus areas in NLV-III. Governments and the private sector alike are\nbeing forced to significantly increase the efficiency of the healthcare system, and consequently\nare beginning to invest heavily in technologies that reduce cost and improve the quality of care.\nNew technology solutions are emerging from the intersection of a diverse, yet interconnected\nset of technologies that define Information Convergence, including cloud storage, mobile\ncomputing, wireless communications, web-delivered software, big data analytics, diagnostics\nand sensors.\n\n1.C. companies are integrating these technologies in ways that more cost effectively prevent,\ndiagnose, and treat disease. These applications and products can be highly valued by\naddressing costly inefficiencies within the healthcare system. The Fund Managers believe I.C.\nwill play an enabling role in many of the initiatives that will form the core of healthcare reform,\nincluding the transformation of healthcare reimbursement models from volume to value-based,\nand that this will be a major area of opportunity for investors for the foreseeable future.\n\nWithin LC. the Fund will seek opportunities that target some of the largest inefficiencies in the\nhealthcare system. These include: (1) inefficiency in delivery of care and excess administrative\ncosts; (2) unnecessary services and missed opportunities for prevention; and (3) inflated pricing\nand fraud. Coming out of these large, identified problem areas are a number of discrete\ninvestable themes. These are the primary target of New Leaf’s investment strategy in I.C. and\nthey include the following:\n\nProblem Area: Inefficient Delivery and Excess Administrative Costs\n\ne Investment Theme - Operational & Care Delivery Efficiency: Process improvement and\noptimization can only occur when data is available to identify the problems and\nmeasure the impact of solutions. With shrinking margins and shifting value objectives,\nhealthcare providers are under pressure to understand and improve their businesses\nand operations. Technologies that allow the collection and analysis of relevant data on\nthe efficiency of care-delivery will be foundational to this evolution. AwarePoint (NLV-\nII) delivers enterprise awareness solutions for the hospital and other healthcare facilities,\nis an example of a company fitting this theme.\n\n38 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024049",
