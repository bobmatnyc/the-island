  "text": "KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\n\nThere is insufficient evidence that Mr. Epstein targeted minors, as required. The\nevidentiary pattern does not even establish willful blindness since Mr. Epstein took steps to\nensure his visitors were over 18—and certainly took none to avoid knowing. But, even if the\ngovernment contends that it possesses evidence that could demonstrate that Mr. Epstein knew or\nshould have known or suspected that a small number of the masseuses were underage, that would\nstill not make this an appropriate case for federal, rather than state prosecution. The federal\nstatutes were not intended to supersede state prosecutions involving isolated instances of\nunderage sex. Instead, the federal statutes were intended for large-scale rings or for an\nindividual who was engaged, while using interstate facilities such as the Internet, with the willful\ntargeting of minors.\n\nThe government’s evidence, even when stretched to the limit, will not show a pattern of\ntargeting underage persons for illegal sexual activity. A federal prosecution should not become a\ncontest between the prosecution and defense over whether the defendant knew, suspected or\nshould have known whether a particular person was or was not over age. The history of cases\nbrought under this statute make crystal clear that knowledge of the defendant regarding the age\nof the women is required—either by admission or by incontrovertible transcripts of\nconversations (i.e. stings operations which require repeated acknowledgment of the defendant’s\nawareness of the victims’ age). Even states with absolute liability about mistake regarding age\nrarely prosecute cases where definitive proof is lacking (Palm Beach County rarely does and\nwhen it does, it imposes house arrest sentences). This is a matter for the exercise of state\nprosecutorial discretion and not federal mandatory minimum statutes that were not intended to\ncover such conduct.\n\nA third essential element of § 2422(b) is the requirement that the government prove that\nthe defendant actually believed that the person being persuaded (coerced, etc.) was a minor at the\ntime of the communication. See e.g., Offense Instruction 80, Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury\nInstructions-Criminal (2003) (“The defendant can be found guilty of that offense only if...the\ndefendant believed that such individual was less than (18) years of age...”); United States v.\nMurrell, 368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11™ Cir. 2004) (§ 2422(b) requires that the defendant knowingly\ntarget a minor). Importantly, then, all the elements must be proven with respect to a specific\nperson. However, we are told that the majority of proof is no more than toll records, not\nrecorded conversations or Internet chat transcripts, but toll records and perhaps a memory of.\nwhat was said years ago on a particular call for a particular request from a particular person\nacting at Mr. Epstein’s direction.\n\nTwo final points bear special emphasis here. The statute, which according to Santos and\nCuellar must be narrowly construed, also requires that the inducement be to engage in\nprostitution or sexual activity “for which [the defendant] can be charged.” 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b).\nHowever, simple prostitution is not defined (or made punishable) in the U.S. Code, and state law\nthus supplies the appropriate reference point. Under Florida law, “prostitution” entails the\n“giving or receiving of the body for sexual activity for hire,” Fla. Stat. § 796.07(1)(a), and the\nterm “sexual activity” is limited to “oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012150",
