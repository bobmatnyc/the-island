  "text": "Inference: International Review of Science\n\nFeedback & Comments\n\nSwede White\nWolfram Research.\n\n“The journal's content is quite interesting, and this sounds like a wonderful opportunity.”\n\nWilliam A. Wilson\nEntrepreneur and artificial intelligence researcher.\n\n“T hadn't previously heard of your magazine, but when I clicked over to your website my eye was\nimmediately caught by Gregory Chaitin's article, as he is one of my favorite mathematicians. I\nalso read with great pleasure \"Categories: From Zero to Infinity\" by Pierre Schapira, which did\nan excellent job of communicating a highly technical subject. I'm now looking forward to\nperusing the rest of the site when I have time!”\n\nNatalie Wolchover\n\nAward-winning science writer, she has covered the physics beat on staff at Quanta Magazine\nsince the magazine's launch in 2013.\n\n“Thank you very much for the invitation to write for your excellent journal. I have read many\nwonderful essays in Inference, and would be honored to contribute, if only I had the time and\nenergy to do so.\n\nI hope we can stay in touch and perhaps revisit the possibility of my writing for you at a future\ntime. I especially appreciate how long and technical, but still crystal clear, your articles tend to\nbe, permitting great depth and thoroughness. Congratulations to you and your team.”\n\n16\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022460",
