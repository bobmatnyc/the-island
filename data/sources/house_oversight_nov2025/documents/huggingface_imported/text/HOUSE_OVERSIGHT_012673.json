Our understanding is -\nthat the state case is stil] pending. As such, the procedural posture of the state case does not\nimplicate the petite policy.\n\nthe policy “does not apply ... where the [state] prosecution, involved only 4 minor part of the\ncontemplated federal charges.” USAM 9-2.03 1(B). Based on our understanding of the possible\nfederal charges and existing state charges, we do not think the petite policy would be an issue\nshould federal proceedings take place,\n\nFederalism and Prosecutorial Discretion. All of the above issues essentially ask whether\na federal prosecution can proceed. We understand, however, that you also ask whether a federal\nprosecution skoudd proceed, even in the event that all of the elements of a federal offense could\nbe proven. On this issue, you raised two arguments: thal the conduct at issue here is traditional ly\na4 state concern because the activity is entirely local, and that the typical prosecution under federal\n\npolicy that a United States Attomey’s Office should not pursue a prosecution. We do not think\n\nSimply, the commercial sexual exploitation of children is a federal concern, even when\nthe conduct is local, and tegardless of whether the defendant provided the child (the “pimp”) or\n\nfraud, or coercion was used. Indeed, the point being made in that letter is that the Department’s\nefforts are Properly focused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the\nexploitation of adults through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, As such, there is no\ninconsistency between the position taken in that letter and the federal prosecution of wholly local\ninstances of the commercial Sexual exploitation of children,\n\nIf Congress wanted to limit the reach of federal statutes only to those who profit from the\ncommercial sexual exploitation of children, or only to those who actually traffic children across\nstate lines, it could have done so. It did not. Finally, that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not\nlook precisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive, We can say with confidence\nthat this case is consistent in principle with other federal prosecutions nationwide. As such, Mr,\nAcosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursve 4 prosecution even though it might\ninvolve a novel application of a federal statute,\n\nConclusion. After carefully considering all the factual and legal issues taised, as well as\nthe arguments concerning the general propriety of a federal case against Mr. Epstein on these\n\n4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012673",
