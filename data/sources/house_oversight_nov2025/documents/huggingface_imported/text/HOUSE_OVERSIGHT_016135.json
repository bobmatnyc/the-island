Based on stock prices as of 28 June 2016.\n\nMaterial fiscal consolidation would be necessary to narrow macro imbalances\nThere is no substitute for fiscal consolidation to maintain Fx policy unchanged. We map\nout below paths for several macro variables depending on fiscal policy and oil prices,\nwith higher oil prices easing the adjustment requirement.\n\nIn a worst case scenario where US$25/bbl oil prices would persist for the next five\nyears, sustainability of the Saudi Fx policy rests on material fiscal consolidation, which\nwe believe is achievable based on the mix of revenue-raising and spending restraint\nplans likely or announced to date. This would require a total 5-year cumulative\nadjustment of SARSOObn (US$133bn; 20% of 2015 GDP or 4ppt of GDP annually) from\n2016 onwards, which is close to what the NTP appears to be targeting in non-oil\nrevenue measures (US$100bn, excluding NTP costs). We think 75% of the adjustment\ncan take place through revenue-raising measures. The remainder of the adjustment\nwould need to take place through capex cuts and is similar in size to the capex\nretrenchment of the 1980-90s. However, note that if one assumes that the 2015 budget\ndeficit will be revised higher to 18.9% of GDP, this adds a need for a further 4ppt of\nGDP cumulative fiscal adjustment to maintain the same trajectory of Fx reserves.\n\nAn overhaul of fiscal policy will likely be required\n\nIn line with the 2016 budget announcement, we would expect tight budgets to be\npassed. We expect a VAT with 5% yield to be implemented in 2018, alongside further\nadministered price adjustments for energy, water and electricity. Implementation of the\nland tax is likely, but it is unclear whether the proceeds will be ring-fenced to be used\nsolely for housing projects. Using solely the recurring existing proceeds of the\nDecember administered price adjustments and a VAT introduction, we still see a need\nfor further fiscal restraint in the order of 1ppt of non-oil GDP annually. The latter would\n\nOS Merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 25\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016135",
