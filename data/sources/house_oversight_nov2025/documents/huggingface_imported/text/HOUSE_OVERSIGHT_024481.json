  "text": "Such interests may involve risks in connection with such third-party involvement, including the possibility\nthat a third-party may be in a position to take (or block) action in a manner contrary to the Company’s\nobjectives or may have financial difficulties resulting in a negative impact on such interest. Acquisitions\nmade with third parties in joint ventures or other entities also may involve carried interests and/or other\nfees payable to such third party partners or co-venturers. There can be no assurance that desirable\nminority shareholder rights will be available or that such rights will provide sufficient protection of the\nCompany’s interests.\n\n6.1.9 Certain of the Company's businesses may require additional capital\n\nCertain of the Company’s businesses, especially those in development phases, may require additional\nfinancing to satisfy their working capital requirements. The amount of the additional financing needed will\ndepend upon the maturity and objectives of the particular business. The Company may seek to raise any\nrequired capital from different sources, and subsidiaries in foreign countries may raise capital locally. The\navailability of capital is generally a function of capital market conditions that are beyond the control of the\nCompany. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to predict accurately the future\ncapital requirements necessary for success or that additional funds will be available from any source as\nneeded. An inability to timely raise capital may materially and adversely affect the Company and/or its\nbusiness.\n\n6.1.10 KUE’s subsidiaries operate in regulated industries; failure to comply with\ngovernmental regulation and licensing requirements could have a material\nadverse effect on operations\n\nThe pre-K-12 education business is highly regulated and is often subsidized with government funding or\nreimbursement programs. In addition, KUE and its subsidiaries may require the consent or approval of\napplicable regulatory authorities in order to acquire or operate particular businesses, including in foreign\njurisdictions where the Company has limited or no experience with the regulatory framework. Failure to\ncomply with applicable laws or regulations, or failure or inability to obtain applicable approvals, could have\na material adverse effect on the operations of KUE and/or its subsidiaries.\n\nFor example, KLC's centers and school programs are subject to numerous state and local regulations and\nlicensing requirements. KLC has policies and procedures in place to assist in complying with such\nregulations and requirements. Although these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, government\nagencies generally review, among ciher things, the fitness and adequacy of buildings and equipment, the\nratio of staff personnel to enrolled children, staff training, record keeping, children's dietary program, the\ndaily curriculum, and compliance with health and safety standards and transportation safety. In most\njurisdictions, these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of the centers and licenses\nmust be renewed periodically. Most jurisdictions establish requirements for background checks or other\nclearance procedures for new employees of child care centers and school programs. Repeated failures\nby any of KLC's centers to comply with applicable regulations may result in sanctions against that center\nor program and other centers or programs in the same jurisdiction, including probation or, in more serious\ncases, suspension or revocation of a center's or program's license to operate. In addition, this type of\naction could attract negative publicity extending beyond that jurisdiction.\n\nA licensing authority may determine that a particular center or program is in violation of applicable\nregulations and may take action against that center or program and possibly other centers or programs in\nthe same jurisdiction, For more information, see \"The Operating Company (KLC OpCo)} — Licensing and\nGovernment Regulation.\"\n\n6.1.11 Future legislation or new regulations may place additional burdens on the\nCompany and have a material adverse effect on operations\n\nAdditional, different and/or more stringent regulations and licensing requirements may become applicable\nin the future due to changes in laws and regulations, judicial or administrative interpretations of existing\nlaws and regulations, changes in the Company's business strategy or for other reasons.
