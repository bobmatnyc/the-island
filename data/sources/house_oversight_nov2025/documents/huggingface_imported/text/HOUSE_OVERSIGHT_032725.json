It would be great if I could get this back\ntomorrow. Nothing is due until the recap is complete, hopefully in about 4 weeks. I am planning to start those\ndiscussions the end of next week.\n\nThings are going well. The more I learn the more excited I get. I will be at Tarana tomorrow\ndiscussing a window mount version to try to get to self-install. 1gbps in a self-install package would be the last\nstep.\n\nWe will only need a tower ever 4-5km in the city, which is basically 2 or 3 rooftops for all of Boston.\nI met with American Tower today (I know their CEO and CTO) and they have plenty of room on the John\nHancock.\n\nFun Stuff and great to be doing something together!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032725",
