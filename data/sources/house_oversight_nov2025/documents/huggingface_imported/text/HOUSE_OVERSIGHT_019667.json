These interviews were all with three jour-\nnalists who had opposed NSA surveillance: James Bamford, writing\nfor Wired magazine; Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian;\nand Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor of The Nation. He also gave\na televised interview to Brian Williams of NBC News in which he\nexplained that because he had no access to the NSA documents in\nRussia, he could not provide access to the Russians even if they\n“break my fingers.”\n\nSnowden did not specify where, when, or how the putative\ndestruction of the files occurred and offered neither witnesses nor\nevidence, other than the meaningless blank laptop screen, to cor-\nroborate it. Still his new self-serving narrative was widely accepted\nby the media. The fact remains, though, that Snowden went to con-\nsiderable risk to select, copy, and steal Level 3 documents before\nleaving Hawaii for Hong Kong. These secrets were his last potential\nbargaining chips. Why would he have destroyed them in June in\nHong Kong?\n\n© It is also difficult for me to accept that Snowden would destroy ®\nthese documents because he feared the Russians might get them.\nIf he was so concerned about the possibility, he could have stayed\nin Hong Kong and fought extradition instead of flying to Russia.\nSurely he must have realized that even without the files on his com-\nputer, the Russian intelligence service could still obtain the NSA\nsecrets he held in his head.

Even if one were will-\ning to accept his new claim, it still would not mean that the NSA\ndocuments had not fallen into the hands of adversaries. If he had\ndestroyed all of the electronic copies of the NSA’s data before board-\ning his flight to Moscow, he still couldn’t be “100 percent” certain, as\nhe claimed, that the data had not been accessed by others prior to his\ndeparture from Hong Kong.
