The Mets owners\nhave agreed to pay up to $162 million\n— and likely much less — in a deal\nwith the trustee for Bernard Madoff’s\nfraud victims.\n\nSo on Wednesday at the general\nmanagers’ meeting, Boras said his view\nof the Dodgers had changed. -\n\n“| think they bought the store,” he\nsaid.\n\nAnd as for the Mets?\n\n“The best you can say is that they\nmight be in the freezer section,” he\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nCONTINUED FROMTHE BACK PAGE\n\nagainst Charlotte Amalie High\nSchool in mid-October, but rebound-\ned with a 46-0 win over Central High\non St. Croix before last week’s bye.\n\n“We havea lot of senior leadership,”\nNeely said, “so really these guys gov-\nem themselves — guys like Nathan\nBraithwaite, our quarterback.”\n\nBraithwaite, a senior, has found\nCilliers and senior receivers Omar\nHenderson and Lucas Berry on\ntouchdown passes.\n\nKean High sophomore quarterback\n\nexplained. “But there’s a lot of good,\nlongstanding products that they can\nacquire there.”\n\nSlugger Josh Hamilton and pitcher\nZack Greinke are among the top play-\ners in a relatively weak free-agent class\nthat also includes outfielders B.J.\nUpton, Michael Bourn, Torii Hunter\nand Nick Swisher; first baseman Adam\nLaRoche; and pitchers Kyle Lohse and\nRafael Sonano. :\n\nBaseball estimates revenue this year\nat $2.5 billion — an increase of about\n$500 million. National television con-\ntracts with Fox and Turner that run\nfrom 2014-21 will double the average\nyearly money baseball receives to\nabout $800 million.\n\nAnd perhaps the biggest evidence of\nbasebail’s wealth is franchise values -~\nthe Dodgers sold for $2 billion this\n\nShunnel Greenaway must exhibit\nmore poise to give his team a\nchance.\n\nGreenaway looked sharp in the\nfirst half of last week’s 36-10 loss to\nCAHS, but the offense sputtered\ndown the stretch.\n\n“I’m trying to keep him to main-\ntain focus and be patient,” Donovan\nsaid. “When he was patient in the\nfirst half ofthe game, we were mov-\ning the bail. Everything doesn’t have\nto be deep. Every pass doesn’t have\nto be a touchdown right away. He’s\nonly 16 years old, so sometimes he\ngets too excited and gets away from\n\nLocal Briefs\n\nyear in a bankruptcy court auction and\nthe lowly San Diego Padres were\nbought for $800 million.\n\nSince the Dodgers were bought last\nspring by a group headed by Mark\nWalter, Stan Kasten and Magic\nJohnson, they increased their payroll\nby about $35 million, adding infielder\nHanley Ramirez, first baseman Adrian\nGonzalez, closer Brandon League,\npitcher Josh Beckett and outfielder Carl\nCrawford.\n\nThe Dodgers’ payroll next year\nmight approach or surpass that of the\nNew York Yankees, who have topped\nspending every year since Los Angeles\nedged them by $1 million in 200).\n\nNew York is vowing to cut its payroll\nby 2014 because of changes in the col-\nlective bargaining agreement that will\ncut the team’s revenue-sharing bill if it\ndoesn’t wind up paying a luxury tax.\n\nInfielder Maicer lztuns became the\nfirst major league free agent to switch\nteams this offseason, agreeing to a $10\nmillion, three-year contract with the\nToronto Blue Jays.
