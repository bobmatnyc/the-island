  "text": "6. Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses.\n\nMost people are good at a handful of things and utterly miserable at most. I am great at product creation\nand marketing but terrible at most of the things that follow.\n\nMy body is designed to lift heavy objects and throw them, and that’s it. I ignored this for a long time.\nI tried swimming and looked like a drowning monkey. I tried basketball and looked like a caveman.\nThen I became a fighter and took off.\n\nIt is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in\nyour armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement\nfixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead\nof constant repair.\n\n7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.\n\nIt is possible to have too much of a good thing. In excess, most endeavors and possessions take on the\ncharacteristics of their opposite. Thus:\n\nPacifists become militants.\nFreedom fighters become tyrants.\nBlessings become curses.\n\nHelp becomes hindrance. More becomes less +\n\nToo much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don’t want. This is true of\npossessions and even time. Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time,\nwhich is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed\nto what you feel obligated to do.\n\n8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.\n\nThere is much to be said for the power of money as currency (I’m a fan myself), but adding more of it\njust isn’t the answer as often as we’d like to think. In part, it’s laziness. “If only I had more money” is\nthe easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life\nof enjoyment—now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming\nroutine, we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise: “John, I'd love to talk\nabout the gaping void I feel in my life, the hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I\nstart my computer in the moming, but I have so much work to do! I’ve got at least three hours of\nunimportant e-mail to reply to before calling the prospects who said ‘no’ yesterday. Gotta run!”\n\nBusy yourself with the routine of the money wheel, pretend it’s the fix-all, and you artfully create a\nconstant distraction that prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is. Deep down, you know it’s all\nan illusion, but with everyone participating in the same game of make-believe, it’s easy to forget.\n\nThe problem is more than money.\n\n9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.\n\nAmong dietitians and nutritionists, there is some debate over the value of a calorie. Is a calorie a calorie,\nmuch like a rose is a rose? Is fat loss as simple as expending more calories than you consume, or is the\nsource of those calories important? Based on work with top athletes, I know the answer to be the latter.\n\nWhat about income? Is a dollar is a dollar is a dollar? The New Rich don’t think so.\nLet’s look at this like a fifth-grade math problem. Two hardworking chaps are headed toward each\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013821",
