  "text": "15.3 Dual Network Structure 281\n\npreferential attachment, because Atoms with more links will tend to get more STI, and thus\nwill tend to get selected by more cognitive processes, which will cause them to grow more\nlinks. For this reason, in most circumstances, a CogPrime system in which most link-building\ncognitive processes rely heavily on ECAN to guide their activities will tend to contain a small-\nworld-network Atomspace. This is not rigorously guaranteed to be the case for any possible\ncombination of environment and goals, but it is commonsensically likely to nearly always be\nthe case.\n\nOne consequence of the small worlds structure of the Atomspace is that, in exploring other\nproperties of the Atom network, it is particularly important to look at the hub nodes. For\ninstance, if one is studying whether hierarchical and heterarchical subnetworks of the Atomspace\nexist, and whether they are well-aligned with each other, it is important to look at hierarchical\nand heterarchical connections between hub nodes in particular (and secondary hubs, etc.). A\npattern of hierarchical or dual network connection that only held up among the more sparsely\nconnected nodes in a small-world network would be a strange thing, and perhaps not that\ncognitively useful.\n\n15.3 Dual Network Structure\n\nOne of the key theoretical notions in patternist philosophy is that complex cognitive systems\nevolve internal dual network structures, comprising superposed, harmonized hierarchical and\nheterarchical networks. Now we explore some of the specific CogPrime structures and dynamics\nmilitating in favor of the emergence of dual networks.\n\n15.3.1 Hierarchical Networks\n\nThe hierarchical nature of human linguistic concepts is well known, and is illustrated in Figure\n15.2 for the commonsense knowledge domain (using a graph drawn from WordNet, a huge con-\ncept hierarchy covering 50K+ English-language concepts), and in Figure 15.4 for a specialized\nknowledge subdomain, genetics. Due to this fact, a certain amount of hierarchy can be expected\nto emerge in the Atomspace of any linguistically savvy CogPrime, simply due to its modeling\nof the linguistic concepts that it hears and reads.\n\nHierarchy also exists in the natural world apart from language, which is the reason that many\nsensorimotor-knowledge-focused AGI systems (e.g. DeSTIN and HTM, mentioned in Chapter\n4 above) feature hierarchical structures. In these cases the hierarchies are normally spatiotem-\nporal in nature - with lower layers containing elements responding to more localized aspects\nof the perceptual field, and smaller, more localized groups of actuators. This kind of hierarchy\ncertainly could emerge in an AGI system, but in CogPrime we have opted for a different route.\nIf a CogPrime system is hybridized with a hierarchical sensorimotor network like one of those\nmentioned above, then the Atoms linked to the nodes in the hierarchical sensorimotor network\nwill naturally possess hierarchical conceptual relationships, and will thus naturally grow hier-\narchical links between them (e.g. InheritanceLinks and IntensionalInheritanceLinks via PLN,\nAsymmetricHebbianLinks via ECAN).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013197",
