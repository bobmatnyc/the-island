The PLO had regained its uncontested leadership,\nand the Palestinian Authority received a massive financial boost with the influx of\ndonor money from across the world. Israel received a moral boost as a large number of\ncountries formally recognized its existence and established diplomatic relations.\n\nA hallmark of the Declaration of Principles was the establishment of a gradual\napproach to resolving the conflict. Gradualism now became the keyword for describing\nthe peace process. By breaking the overall goal of peace into manageable sections that\ncould be addressed in sequence, the Oslo process allowed for progress to be made and\ntrust to develop on less contentious issues before tackling more controversial topics like\nJerusalem, borders, security arrangements, and refugees, which could threaten to derail\nany talks.\n\nOne of the principal advantages of the step-by-step or gradualist approach was that\nit enabled the parties to reach compromises through ongoing dialogue and interaction\nwith each other by starting with the easiest issues and leaving the hardest for last. It\nallowed for an incremental change in perceptions and political positions. Although\ngradualism allowed success to be achieved in a variety of areas, moving the process\nforward, at each stage, depended on the parties taking the bold steps necessary to fulfill\ntheir respective commitments. The main weakness was slow movement in implemen-\ntation, with progress falling behind agreed upon timelines. This led to periodic\ndisillusionment and back-sliding.\n\nA recurrent problem was that the parties had failed to agree on a mechanism to\npenalize non-compliance. This critical deficiency undermined progress. As leaders and\nthe political climate changed, so too did the resolve to implement.\n\nSuccessful gradualism required the use of ambiguous language on the most conten-\ntious issues: Jerusalem, borders, security, and refugees. The successive Israeli govern-\nments and the Palestinian leadership had substantially different views on the final\nstatus of all four of these issues. The language contained within the Oslo documents, as\nwell as subsequent agreements, provides room for interpretation. Either side could\nclaim that the text represents their interests. This allowed leaders to go home to their\nrespective constituents and retain popular support.\n\nAnother practice that proved effective was the use of the annexes attached to agree-\nments to flesh out disruptive details, or to substantially water down the impact of\ncertain commitments made within the body of the text. In many cases the annexes are\nexhaustively long and detailed but are rarely read by the public, affording the leaders\npolitical space to make agreements that might otherwise face public criticism.\n\nThe three Israeli Prime Ministers who were in office from 1993 to 1999—Rabin,\nPeres, and Netanyahu—approached the challenges of peace through a concept of\ngradualism, postponing the tricky final status issues. Barak, who took office in 1999,\nwas the first Israeli Prime Minister to address the final status head-on with a “totalist”\napproach (read below).\n\nWhile the Oslo process was based on the concept of gradualism, characterized by\nbilateral negotiations—facilitated by a third party—and cumulative small steps dem-\nonstrating good faith, Ariel Sharon eventually took a contrary approach through\n“uncompromising unilateralism”.
