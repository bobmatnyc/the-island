ZUCKERMAN I November 4, 2015 \nEditor's note: This editorial originally appeared in the November 20, 1995 issue of U.S. News & World \nReport. \nThe poet was once asked, \"If your house was burning and you could save only one thing, what would you \nsave?\" The poet answered, \"I would save the fire, for without the fire we are nothing.\" \nIt was Yitzhak Rabin's destiny not to be saved from the frenzy of a madman. But bullets cannot so easily \nextinguish what Rabin's bravery and vision ignited, the fire of Israel's commitment to peace. He might so \neasily have died in the din of battle, this man who made war when he had to. But he died instead amid the \nclamor of peace, with the acclaim of a mass peace rally of Israelis still in the air and still in his mind. It would \nbe his last wish that the flame of peace, for which he gave his life, should not be dimmed by anger and \ndespair. His state funeral, for all its sadness, was inspiring as an occasion for the vindication of his hopes, \nfor a new dedication to Israel's security from America and for a demonstration of goodwill by some former \nArab enemies. \n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Middle East] \nPresident Clinton led a bipartisan delegation that included the congressional Republican leadership, former \nPresident Bush and former Secretary of State George Shultz. It was more than a respectful gesture of \nprotocol. This was a statement of emotional and psychological support from the most powerful nation in the \nworld to a small, isolated country, living in a perilous neighborhood and in a time of great national trauma: \nWe do more than share your grief, we understand your fears; we will not desert you as you have so many \nhttp://www.usnews.cominews/the-report/articles/2015/11/04/yitzhak-rabins-moral-answer-to-the-israeli-dilemma-of-peace-and-survival \n1/4 \n\f11/5/2015 Yitzhak Rabin's Moral Answer to the Israeli Dilemma of Peace and Survival - US News \ntimes in your history been deserted. All Americans could take pride in President Clinton's splendid eulogy; \nin the uniqueness of America's compassion and friendship that extended beyond a calculation of narrow \nnational interest; in the honor of the hand outstretched at a time of need to an ally and friend. The president \nrose to the moment. The hundreds of thousands of people who lined the roadside and saw the American \ndelegation were clearly moved. \nOf equal significance was the roll call of certain \nArab countries (excluding Saudi Arabia) and \nespecially the emotional speech of King Hussein \nof Jordan. His words referring to Yitzhak and \nLeah Rabin as \"my brother\" and \"my sister,\" \nwhich Muslims usually reserve for one another, \nand the tears shed by both the king and his \nqueen, made a deep impression on the Israelis \nfor their humanity and ability to overcome the \npast. Here, clearly, were keepers of Rabin's flame \nof peace, continuing a line that began with Egypt's \nlate president Anwar Sadat. \nIt is hard for outsiders to appreciate the effect on \nIsraelis of the worldwide outpouring of sympathy \nand condolence, with some 80 nations \nrepresented at the funeral. The Israelis are a traumatized people. They have for so long been alone, so \nlong believed they could not rely on anyone but themselves, so long expected the world to stay silent in \ntheir times of trouble. The extensive response resonates for a people who remember how the world closed \nits doors to millions of Jews in the 1930s. Their deaths in the Holocaust were but an obscene multiple of the \ndeaths endured in the crusades and pogroms of earlier centuries when the Jews were betrayed by those \nwho had the power to save them. \nHe alone, at the time, \nhad the capacity to \npersuade the divided \nand wary Israelis to \naccept a compromise. \nIsrael was to be the end of that vulnerable status of perpetual minority, an end to exile and alienation, and a \nbeginning of a normal and natural form of national existence. Israel was home, the new home in the old \ncountry, proclaiming that the Jews had formed a self-reliant community and did not need others to fight \ntheir battles for them. Now they had their future defined by their own family; the farmer, the kibbutznik, the \njet pilot, the shopkeeper, the schoolteacher could coalesce with a traditional language, with their own bible, \ntheir own culture. This self-reliance is a matter of great pride. Jews could look after their own family. When \nthe Jews were kidnapped in Entebbe, Uganda, it was the Israelis who took care of it. A Jewish majority \ncould eliminate Jewish vulnerability, and with their own state, the Israelis could, they thought, be like all \nother nations and like everyone else. The passion for wanting to be normal extended to the notion that to \nbe accepted, Jews did not have to justify themselves by winning the Moral Man of the Year Award every \nyear — at the cost of their own survival. To be 10 percent more moral than other nations would make them \na light unto the world; if they were expected to be 50 percent more moral, they would be dead. \n[READ: One State Over the Status Quo] \nAnd yet Israel cannot be just another secular country. This very land forces the Jews into a dialogue with \ntheir religious past. The land was defined through religion, through the divine promise to Abraham, the \ncovenant with the Father and the covenant with the people of Israel. For many religious Zionists, the victory \nof the Six-Day War, and the subsequent opening to resettlement of the greater land of Israel, were clear \nsigns that God was guiding the secular Zionist revolution toward the ultimate realization of the prophetic \nvision of history. That is why, for some religious Jews, admitting the existence of a Palestinian nation whose \nhomeland is the Holy Land is tantamount to violating the integrity of the Jewish people's covenantal identity. \nBut the Jews faced a dilemma. They had come home to find peace and safety, only to find that their \nneighbors also claimed this tiny piece of land as their home. Even worse, how do you share a home with \nsomeone who says: \"You have no right to be here\"? \nIt is the great contribution of Yitzhak Rabin that has brought a moral answer to this dilemma. There are \nthose Israelis who emphasize self-reliance and remember Rabbi Hillel's saying, \"If I am not for myself, who \nis for me?\" Rabin understood Rabbi Hillel had a second part: \"When I am for myself, what am l'?\" He saw \nthat the Jews could not control 2 million Arabs without frequent resort to a violence that would erode the \nmoral and Jewish character of the state and, with that, its support in the world. He sought a new definition \nof Israeli strength and normalcy that incorporated not just military power but also moral and economic \nfortitude. He decided to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and any pretense that Israel could become a \nhttp://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015/11/04/yitzhak-rabins-moral-answer-to-the-israeli-dilemma-of-peace-and-survival \n2/4 \n\f11/5/2015 Yitzhak Rabin's Moral Answer to the Israeli Dilemma of Peace and Survival - US News \nbinational state in which one people ruled another. \nHe was uniquely qualified for this adventure. Those to his political right had the strength but not the will to \ntake a calculated risk for peace. Those to his political left had the will but not the strength. He alone, at the \ntime, had the capacity to persuade the divided and wary Israelis to accept a compromise arrangement with \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization that held great promise for peace but also great risk. But the risk was \nseen as a risk from the Arabs, not the risk of Jew killing Jew. What the right-wing fanatics were blind to is \nthat their murderous intransigence threatened the state that gave them succor and its necessary \nacceptance by the world. Without the flame of peace, they would have nothing but bloodshed threatening \nevery Israeli's personal security. \n[ZUCKERMAN: The Palestinians' Lies Are Fueling the Violence] \nThe debate over security in Israel is different from the quarrel with the extremists. Many moderate people \nall across Israel are concerned about giving up land, because for years their leaders told them this land \nwas essential to their national security. In Israel, security decisions are made in the context of the terrible \nreality that a single Israeli strategic blunder may mean not only military defeat but a genocidal threat to the \nvery existence of the state — one that the world could not forestall, even if it were willing to. Many Israelis \nask: Will the peace process be the beginning of a new future or the beginning of the end? \nThe Israelis are determined to avoid another genocide, this time in Israel. The decision to exchange lawfully \ncaptured territory for the promise of peace from those who have constantly threatened violence is fraught \nwith unprecedented risk. Israel will not survive in this neighborhood by superior morality in the absence of \nsuperior real strength. Arab moderation is in direct proportion to Israeli strength. If the Arabs could defeat \nIsrael, who could doubt that sooner or later they would try? \nCan Shimon Peres, a durable politician less trusted by Israelis, lead the people in pursuit of Rabin's twin \ngoals of peace and security? He is a consummate international diplomat and served with great distinction \nas prime minister a decade ago. His ardent desire for peace may be part of his problem, for many people \nbelieve he is too eager to cut a deal, too dovish and not skeptical enough about security issues, too \nwrapped up in his own ambitions. So his challenge is to relieve the worries of Israelis as well as meet the \nneeds of the Palestinians. \nIn this effort, American support is crucial. Rabin said he was elected to take risks for peace. President \nClinton said, \"If that is your goal, I will do my best to minimize the risks you must take.\" That is the fire of \nfriendship and support that will enable Israel to fulfill what Rabin so bravely began. \n'Rabin, The Last Day': Venice Review \nInform \nTAGS: Israel, Palestine, Middle East, Judaism \n+ More \nNews Rankings & Consumer Advice \ninform \nhttp://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015/11/04/yitzhak-rabi ns-m oral-answer-to-the-israeli-di lem ma-of- peace-and-survival 3/4",
