  "text": "Indeed, Roberts, with the Daily Mail being her prime outlet, emerges\nas the most vocal accuser—and, in fact, the some total of the current story\nand attention.\n\nThat is, there is no story without her and what is being billed as her\nmemoir of her “sex slavery” with Epstein, written ten years after the fact.\nAlong with the Dershowitz and Prince Andrew charges, Roberts puts, with\nrather some narrative detail, both Clinton and Al and Tipper Gore on the\nisland—and in fact Clinton, apparently with the acquiescence of the Secret\nService, flying in a helicopter piloted by Epstein’s girlfriend, an amateur\npilot. Epstein’s lawyers say that not only have Clinton and the Gores never\nbeen to the Epstein Island, but that there is easy proof of this in secret\nservice records, which would seem to make the memoir opportunistic or\nhallucinatory fiction.\n\nThe FBI, in a recent filing, has argued that Roberts should not be\nparty to the suit against the government because she refused to cooperate\nwith the government in its investigation in 2007, hence has no standing as a\nvictim. (At the same time, the FBI included her on the list of 40 victims with\nwhom it mandated Epstein reach a settlement.)\n\nIt is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers\nthen in Epstein’s case.\n\nEdwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton,\nDonald Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly\nfrom the original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about\nEpstein.\n\nIn addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to\nEpstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton\ntakes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or\nimagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.\n\nAlmost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is approached\nby other media seeking to write about Epstein, often with financial\nincentives.\n\nNo new stories or even new details emerge. Every aspect of the\ncurrent story is based on court filings describing events that may or may not\nhave taken place prior to 2007. It’s as though a kind of ground-hog day of\nmoral opprobrium, a desire to repeat and to savor a new the old details.\n\nA recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not given\nmoney to in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would give it back.\n\nThe world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure\nwalls and the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms ever more\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022764",
