We believe that\nthis comparison is useful because cannabis is used recreationally in much the same way alcohol, coffee\n\nand tobacco are used, and because cannabis may be an alternative to pharmaceuticals currently used\nto treat a range of medical conditions. The following table compares the estimated penetration rate,\n\naverage monthly consumer spending and U.S. retail market size for a number of common stimulants\n\nand pharmaceutical categories.\n\nComparison between Cannabis and Common Stimulants and Substances\n\nwa; Anti- Cannabis\nAlcohol Coffee Tobacco Painkillers the pSSar (Future)\nPrimary Usage Recreational Recreational Recreational Medicinal Medicinal remo\nAdult 9 9 r 4 ; ;\nPenetration % 50% 50% 17% 40% 25% 20%\nMonthly\n\nConsumer $45 to $200 $80 to $100 $40 to $80 $50 to $200 $50 to $100 $50 to $500\n\nSpending\n\nU.S. Retail\n\nMarket Size $2008 $358 $100B $300B $60B $100B\n\nSource: Ackrell Capital\n\nThis comparison demonstrates that our U.S. legalized cannabis market estimates are in line with\n\nU.S. retail markets for alcohol, coffee, tobacco, and pharmaceutical painkillers and antidepressants.\n\n112\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024748",
