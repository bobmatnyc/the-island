  "text": "Fourth, the request must be signed. For corporate\nrequestors, the signatory should be an appropriate senior\nofficer with operational responsibility for the conduct that is\nthe subject of the request and who has been designated by the\ncorporation's chief executive officer. In appropriate cases, DOJ\nalso may require the chief executive officer to sign the request.\nThose signing the request must certify that it contains a true,\ncorrect, and complete disclosure with respect to the proposed\nconduct and the circumstances of the conduct.\n\nFifth, an original and five copies of the request should\nbe addressed to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of\nthe Criminal Division, Attention: FCPA Opinion Group.”\nThe mailing address is P.O. Box 28188 Central Station,\nWashington, D.C. 20038. DOJ also asks that you send an\nelectronic courtesy copy to FCPA.Fraud@usdoj.gov.\n\nDOJ will evaluate the request for an FCPA opinion.“\nA party may withdraw a request for an opinion at any time\nprior to the release of an opinion.“ If the request is complete\nand all the relevant information has been submitted, DOJ will\nrespond to the request by issuing an opinion within 30 days.\nIf the request is incomplete, DOJ will identify for the requestor\nwhat additional information or documents are required for\nDOJ to review the request. Such information must be pro-\nvided to DOJ promptly. Once the additional information has\nbeen received, DOJ will issue an opinion within 30 days of\nreceipt of that additional information.“ DOJ’s FCPA opin-\nions state whether, for purposes of DOJ’s present enforcement\npolicy, the prospective conduct would violate either the issuer\nor domestic concern anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.**\nDOJ also may take other positions in the opinion as it con-\nsiders appropriate.“ To the extent that the opinion concludes\nthat the proposed conduct would not violate the FCPA, a\nrebuttable presumption is created that the requestor’s con-\nduct that was the basis of the opinion is in compliance with\nthe FCPA.“\"* In order to provide non-binding guidance to the\nbusiness community, DOJ makes versions of its opinions pub-\nlicly available on its website.*””\n\nIf, after receiving an opinion, a party is concerned about\nprospective conduct that is beyond the scope of conduct speci-\nfied in a previous request, the party may submit an additional\n\nrequest for an opinion using the procedures outlined above.“®\n\n87\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022589",
