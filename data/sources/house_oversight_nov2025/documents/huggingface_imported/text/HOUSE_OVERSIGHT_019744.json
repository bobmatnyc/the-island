  "text": "256 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nBecause the Aeroflot flight to Cuba was the only means of get-\nting directly from Moscow to Latin America, Russian reporters,\nencouraged by WikiLeaks posts, continued taking the daily eleven-\nhour flight to Cuba until August 1. The charade only ended when\nKucherena said in a press conference at the airport that Snowden\nwould be taking up residency at an undisclosed location in Moscow\nand walked out of the airport with Snowden.\n\nSarah Harrison, Snowden’s companion on the plane to Moscow,\ntold Vogue that she and Snowden for thirty-nine days had shared\na windowless room in the transit zone of the airport where they\nwatched TV, washed their clothes in a sink basin, and ate meals from\nthe nearby Burger King. The only hotel with windowless rooms\nin the transit zone in 2013 was the Vozdushny V-Express Capsule\nHotel, located next to a newly opened Burger King.\n\nThe polite V-Express desk clerk, who spoke English, showed me\nthe standard windowless double room.

The maximum stay allowed by the hotel was twenty-\nfour hours. So either the rule was waived for Snowden, or Harrison\ndid not tell the full truth.\n\nI learned from a former KGB officer that there are VIP quarters\nbeyond the confines of the airport, including suites at the four-\nhundred-room Novotel hotel, which is located about seven miles\naway, that are used for debriefing and other purposes by the security\nservices. According to him, the security services are not restricted\nfrom entering and leaving the transit zone.\n\nThe possibility that Snowden was staying elsewhere would help\nexplain the futile search for him by a large number of reporters\nover those thirty-nine days.
