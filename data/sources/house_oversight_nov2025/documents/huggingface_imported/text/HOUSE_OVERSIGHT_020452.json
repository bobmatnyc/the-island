  "text": "Acknowledgments\n\nThis Working Group was jointly convened by the Hoover Institution at Stanford University\nand the Center on US-China Relations at Asia Society in New York. These co-conveners\nhave also been assisted, financially and logistically, by The Annenberg Foundation Trust\n\nat Sunnylands. We are grateful to each of these institutions for their support of our work,\nand to Thomas Gilligan, Director of the Hoover Institution, and Ambassador David Lane,\nPresident of The Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands, for their personal support\n\nof this project. We also thank the latter two institutions, as well as the China Policy\nProgram of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University, for\nsupporting and hosting meetings of the Working Group.\n\nThis report has been a collaborative effort among a group of American scholars and policy\npractitioners who have spent long careers studying and engaging China, Asia more broadly,\nand a wide variety of political systems around the world. Each participant also has an\nabiding interest in protecting and strengthening democratic institutions in the United\nStates and elsewhere in the world. While different participants took the lead in drafting\nparticular sections of the report, each section was reviewed and contributed to by a number\nof participants in what became a truly collective and collaborative research effort. Our\ngeneral findings and policy principles represent a broad—though not necessarily complete—\nconsensus of the Working Group Participants.\n\nThis Working Group grew out of the Task Force on US-China Relations (chaired by Susan\nShirk and Orville Schell}, and we thank the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the\nHenry Luce Foundation for their support of the Task Force. Although the two efforts share\nmany members in common, they are separate and distinct endeavors.\n\nWe present this report as the collective product of discussions and research among a group\nof distinguished American specialists on China and US foreign affairs. It analyzes the\ngrowing challenge posed by China’s influence-seeking activities in the United States across\na number of important sectors of American public life. However, as we note throughout the\nreport, these influence activities are not confined to the US. Indeed, they appear in different\nforms and to different degrees in a large number of other democratic societies around the\nworld (in some cases more deeply than in the US). We therefore have opted to include in an\nAppendix short summary reports on China’s influence activities (and the resulting national\nresponses) in eight other countries,\n\nWe owe a particular debt of thanks to Kyle Hutzler, an MBA student at Stanford University\nwith significant experience in China. His superior organizational skills and uncomplaining\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020452",
