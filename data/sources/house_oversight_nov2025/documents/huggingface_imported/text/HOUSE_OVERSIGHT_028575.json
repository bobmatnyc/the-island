  "text": "Cite as: 586 U.S. (2019) 17\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntion as one way both to diminish the risk of conflict and to\npromote economic development and commercial prosper-\nity. Congress at that time and at the request of many of\nthose organizations enacted the Immunities Act. Given\nthe differences between international organizations and\nnation states, along with the Act’s purposes and the risk of\nuntoward consequences, I would leave the Immunities Act\nwhere we found it—as providing for immunity in both\ncommercial and noncommercial suits.\n\nMy decision rests primarily not upon linguistic analysis,\nbut upon basic statutory purposes. Linguistic methods\nalone, however artfully employed, too often can be used to\njustify opposite conclusions. Purposes, derived from con-\ntext, informed by history, and tested by recognition of\nrelated consequences, will more often lead us to legally\nsound, workable interpretations—as they have consistently\ndone in the past. These methods of interpretation can\nhelp voters hold officials accountable for their decisions\nand permit citizens of our diverse democracy to live to-\ngether productively and in peace—basic objectives in\nAmerica of the rule of law itself.\n\nWith respect, I dissent.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028575",
