But of course I'd like to use the footage. I decided when--way back-- we got \nthis very negative answer back from his lawyers that I should just take my time about asking --since it \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 023202 \nwould take us 2 years to be ready to edit the footage anyway (The online course is chronological. When I \ntaped Woody we were still back in 1730. Now we've gotten to the 1920s) \nWell, we've now arrived at the season when we'll be editing materials on William Carlos Williams for our \ncourse on Modernism and, as we discussed on Saturday, on poetry and other arts, The Poetry of Art, Sport, \nand Play \nI would also, of course, love to make a tv episode out of the conversation, but the threshold question is \nwhether he'll let us use it for anything at all. In case it would matter, \nOther performers who have already taped with me include \nJohn Lithgow, \nDiane Paulus \nJulie Taymor \nNas \nEve Ensler \nDamian Woetzel \nKate Burton \nLil Buck Riley \nAlfre Woodard \nHerbie Hancock \nTony Kushner \nNatalia Zukerman \nand those who have agreed to tape with me include \nSally Field \nLena Dunham \nYo Yo Ma \nAnna Deveare Smith \nand more. \nThose in other fields include journalists, senators, president clinton etc etc. You've read my pitch before \n(many times) \nHis is one of only two releases that we haven't gotten. What do you think of my chances? \nLisa \nElisa New \nPowell M.
