CASCADING GRAT & INSTALLMENT SALE ANALYSIS\nCONFIDENTIAL\nInvestment products: Not FDIC insured • No bank guarantee • May lose value\nPlease see important information at the end of this presentation.\n\nA sale to an IDGT is a tax-efficient way to transfer future appreciation of an asset\nIntentionally Defective Grantor Trust (“IDGT”)\n• Grantor makes arm’s length sale of assets to an irrevocable trust\n• Grantor receives a note for the fair market value of the asset plus interest at current AFR\n• Grantor pays income taxes generated by trust assets\n• After the note is paid, remaining trust assets pass to heirs gift tax free\n• Additional considerations\n– trust should be “pre-funded” by grantor to provide sufficient coverage for the note\n– having the loan guaranteed by trust beneficiaries may be beneficial\n– advisable to allocate GST exemption to trust in order to maximize benefit to heirs\nCONFIDENTIAL\n1\nHow a sale to an IDGT works\n1\n2\n3\n4\nSell asset at fair market value to the trust in\nreturn for a promissory note bearing interest\nat proper AFR* based upon term of loan\nReceive payments satisfying\nterms of note\nPay income tax on trust income and realized\ngain\nAfter note is paid off, remaining assets in trust\nare available, free of gift tax, for\nbeneficiaries**\nGrantor\n3\nPay income\ntax on trust\nincome and\nrealized\ngain\n1\n2\nReceive\npayments\nSell asset to trust for a note\nIDGT\nBeneficiaries\n4\nRemaining assets\npass to beneficiaries*\nTo enhance the potential benefits consider funding a series of cascading GRATs – the\nremainders can be added to the IDGT\nIf the cascading GRATs are successful, at the end of the cascading GRAT terms\nadditional assets can be sold to the IDGT\nCONFIDENTIAL\n* AFRs are defined as: 1) short-term - not over three years; 2) mid-term - over three, but not over nine years; 3) long-term - over nine years.\n** If Grantor dies before note is satisfied, the fair market value of the note is includible in grantor’s estate.\n2\nA “Cascading GRAT” strategy enhances the benefits of a GRAT\n• The “Cascading GRAT” strategy uses a GRAT’s annuity stream to fund subsequent\nshort-term GRATs\n– annual reinvestment of annuity stream enhances potential value for beneficiaries\n• Multiple short-term GRATs allow you to take advantage of\nmarket volatility\n– shorter terms permit market “spikes” to be captured immediately\n• Short-term GRATs enable you to better manage mortality risks\n– if grantor dies during term of trust, the assets in the GRAT are included in the estate\n– grantor has greater probability of surviving a shorter term\nCONFIDENTIAL\n3\nHow a “Cascading GRAT” strategy works\n1\nGrantor transfers asset(s) to an irrevocable\ntrust. Grantor may manage GRAT assets as\ntrustee.\n2\nIf necessary, grantor pays gift tax or\nuses gift tax exemption on transfer\n2\n3\nGrantor pays little or no gift tax, or uses\ngift tax exemption*, on present value of\ntrust remainder**\nAnnuity payments from existing GRATs\nfund a new GRAT\nGrantor\ntransfers\nasset(s)\nYear 0\n1\nGrantor\nGRAT 1\n4\n3\nGrantor pays tax on ordinary income\nand realized gain earned by the trust\nAnnuity payments funds new GRAT\n4\nGrantor pays tax on ordinary income and\nrealized gain earned by the trust (but not\non annuity amount transferred from trust\nto grantor)\nYear 1\nAnnuity 1a\nGRAT 2\n5\nWhen trust term ends, remaining trust\nassets pass to beneficiaries free of gift tax\n– if grantor does not survive the term,\ntrust assets are included\nin the estate and subject to\nestate tax\nBeneficiaries’\nTrust\nRemaining\nassets\n5\nTrust ends\nAnnuity 1b\n3\nAnnuity\nGRAT 3\nAnnuity 2a\nAnnuity payment funds new GRAT\nCONFIDENTIAL\n*Gift tax exemption in 2012 shelters up to $5,120,000 per individual of value transferred from gift tax.\n**Calculation based on Treasury discount rate in effect at time of funding GRAT. A recent Tax Court decision (Walton v. Commissioner, 115 T.C.
