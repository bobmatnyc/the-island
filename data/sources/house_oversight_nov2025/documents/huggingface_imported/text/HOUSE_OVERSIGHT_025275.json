We think valuations\nof EM corporate bonds are more attractive than valuations of EM sovereign bonds. Additionally, the\ngradual recovery in EM we expect over coming quarters should support the performance of EM corporate\nbonds relative to EM sovereign bonds. Corporate bonds tend to outperform sovereign bonds during\nperiods of accelerating growth.\n¢ However, absolute returns of EM bonds will be lower than in the past, we think, as the room for spreads\nto tighten further has become more limited. We expect total returns of less than 2% for EM sovereigns\nand close to 4% for EM corporate bonds over the next six months.\n¢ Negative headlines from the Eurozone or global growth fears might put renewed short-term pressure on\nEM bond prices. We think that periods of price weakness offer attractive entry points.\n\n4 Positive scenario EMBI Global/CEMBI spread target (6-month): 235bps/230bps\n\n¢ Yield stability in Europe's core markets and higher-than-expected growth in the US would provide a\nfavorable backdrop for EM fixed-income spreads. In such an environment, issuers of lower credit quality\nwould likely fare better. Average spreads could tighten to below 240bps in such an environment.\n\n& Negative scenario EMBI Global/CEMBI spread target (6-month): 555bps/750bps\n\ne An environment of renewed escalating risk aversion in Europe, deteriorating EM funding markets,\nweakening global growth prospects, and lower commodity prices could impact EM credit negatively.\nLiquidity in emerging market bonds could dry up and spreads could spike.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nCore market yields The direction of US Treasury and German Bund yields are important for EM fixed\nincome spreads, especially for USD- and EUR-denominated bonds.\nKey date: Dec 6, European Central Bank meeting\n\nCapital flows The European debt crisis may lead to further periods of outflows and weaker\n\nprices, which could offer attractive entry levels for investors.\n\nMonetary policy cycles | Monetary policy easing remains a key topic for local currency bonds. We look for\ncentral bank policy announcements in key markets.

We advise\nclients to focus on investment grade\nbonds in the current environment. We\nrecommend taking profit on selected EM\nsovereign bonds. Please refer to our EM\nbond list for issuer- and bond-specific\nguidance.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne EM bonds are attractive for longer-term\ninvestors looking for higher yields.\n\ne Local markets in Asia offer interesting\nopportunities for longer-term investors\nbecause of a supportive currency outlook.\n\nEM sovereigns relatively expensive\ncompared to EM corporates\n\nSpreads of EM bonds over US Treasuries, in bps\n600\n\n500\n\nOkt-09 Aor-10 Apr-11 Okt-11\n— Emerging market sovereign bonds (EMBI Global}\n\nEmerging market corporate bonds (CEMBI Broad)\n\nOkt-10\n\nApr-12\n\nSource: JP Morgan, UBS, as of 15 October 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO's asset class specialist Michael Bolliger, michael.bolliger@ubs.com and Kilian Reber, kilian.reber@ubs.com 28\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025275",
