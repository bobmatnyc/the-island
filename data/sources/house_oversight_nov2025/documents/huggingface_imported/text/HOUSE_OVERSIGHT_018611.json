  "text": "Other men seem to be having issues with their age. One mentioned that he's just turned\n40, and that's really bugging him. Then he flaked out on me a couple times -- I don't think\nhe was completely okay with his own decision to be seeing me. But anyway, often,\nanother thing these men seem to get out of it is access to someone who has a bunch of\nyouthful energy and optimism and just plain new ideas. A lot of them have mentioned\nfeeling stuck, or bored, or cynical, or intellectually constrained. So in this sense sex is\nonly one thing I'm offering them -- I'm also offering them optimism, hope, energy, and so\non. Firstly, the sex is good in and of itself, as most of them aren't getting laid otherwise.\nBut the sex is also a symbol of them getting access to my youthful energy or whatever.\n\nI think the archetypal image of a mistress involves a woman being \"kept\" so that she\ndoesn't have to work, so that she can be available for sex basically whenever. But I don't\nthink this is what the men I see want. I am more valuable to them because I have other\nwork that I am seriously invested in, and am having sex with them anyway. Again, these\nmen are interested in a woman who they see as more \"equal\" to them -- in this case,\ndefined by earnings potential -- and they seem gratified by the idea that they could help\nme enter their income bracket someday. This is, of course, still kind of patronizing; like I\nsaid, they keep using words like \"mentor.\" It's also presumptuous. But I think a lot of\nthem being patronizing and presumptuous can probably be attributed to age and wealth,\nand only some of it to gender.\n\nI think I've learned more about class and money than I have about gender. It turns out\nthere are people to whom $1,000 versus $3,000 doesn't matter that much, and I finally\nunderstand that on a visceral level. $1,000 doesn't mean the same thing to me as it does to\nmost of them. I knew this, but now I really know it.\n\nAnother thing I've been struck by is exactly how much romantic relationships are worth.\nI've had several clients tell me they don't feel wealthy, and they feel like they worry about\nmoney a lot. I think they were sincere. Of course, my first thought was: don't you think\nthat your $2,000-per-month prostitute is part of the budget that could be trimmed? But I\nthink that maybe it's not, actually. I think they think that investing a lot of money in me is\na good investment for them if it gives them a release valve so they can deal with the rest\nof their lives. They're probably right.\n\nClarisse Thorn: You mentioned that you feel powerful in your relationships with\nthese men. But there are issues of your safety, right?\n\nOlivia: I think there are issues of safety anytime a person meets someone they don't really\nknow, especially if they plan to spend time in private. And especially if you're dealing\nwith topics as sensitive as sex or money. There may be more issues of safety with this\nbecause some people really do believe that money can buy them anything. But for the\nmost part, when I meet people they seem very respectful.\n\nThings I do to increase my safety are that I tell my husband and my friends where I'm\ngoing to be, I tell them exactly where I am. I'll do things like take down a client's license\nplate number and text it to my husband. I've been thinking maybe I should look at each\nclient's driver's license too, and text the client's name and driver's license number to my\nhusband. I think some clients might feel threatened by that, though.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018611",
