  "text": "In the linked article, Cisco acknowledges that remote work arrangements are “here to stay” yet lists a\nset of security issues. It makes sense to preemptively research solutions so that you are armed and ready\n\nif your employer raises these concerns. http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2008/prod_020508 html.\n—Contributed by RAINA\n\n58. If you’re an entrepreneur, don’t skip this chapter. This introduction to remote working tools and\ntactics is integral to the international pieces of the puzzle that follow.\n\n59. This verb is used by Japanese women as well, even though female workers are referred to as\n“OL” — office ladies.\n\n60. Any reason to be home will do (cable or phone installation, home repairs, etc.) or, if you prefer\nnot to use a ruse, work a weekend or take two vacation days.\n\n61. Review the Puppy Dog Close from “Income Autopilot II: Testing the Muse.”\n\n62. Do not digress from your goal. Once you’ve addressed an objection or concern, go for the close.\n63. Friday is the best day to be in the office. People are relaxed and tend to leave early.\n\n64. Do not accept a vague refusal. Pinpointing the main concern in detail enables you to overcome it.\n\n65. Don’t jump to the defensive after an objection. Acknowledge the validity of a boss’s concerns to\nprevent an ego-driven battle of wills.\n\n66. Note this indirect threat dressed as a confession. It will make the boss think twice about refusing\nbut prevents the win-lose outcome of an ultimatum.\n\n67. This removes the boss’s ability to call you to the office. This is critical for making the first jump\noverseas.\n\n®\n\nBeyond Repair\n\n» KILLING YOUR JOB\n\nAll courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it’s impossible), but\ncalculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth.\nDevelop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.\n\n—NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI, The Prince\n\nExistential Pleas and Resignations Mad Libs\nBY ED MURRAY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013947",
