  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n801\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nstam or New York law. Similarly, Plain-\ntiffs have not pleaded facts to suggest the\nPrinces knew they were making contribu-\ntions to terrorist fronts and provided sub-\nstantial assistance or encouragement to\nthe terrorists to satisfy Boum or New York\nlaw. The Court has reviewed the com-\nplaints in their entirety and finds no alle-\ngations from which it can infer that the\nPrinces knew the charities to which they\ndonated were fronts for al Qaeda. The\nCourt is not ruling as a matter of law that\na defendant cannot be liable for contribu-\ntions to organizations that are not them-\nselves designated terrorists. But in such a\ncase, there must be some facts presented\nto support the allegation that the defen-\ndant knew the receiving organization to be\na solicitor, collector, supporter, front or\nlaunderer for such an entity. There must\nbe some facts to support an inference that\nthe defendant knowingly provided assis-\ntance or encouragement to the wrongdoer.\nHere, there are no such factual bases pre-\nsented, there are only conclusions. See\nRobinson, 269 F.3d at 146 “(We note that\nthe conclusory nature of [plaintiffs] alleza-\ntions alone would give us pause before we\nwould allow them to sustain jurisdiction.”)\n(citing Zappa Middle Kast Const. Co. v.\nEmirate of Abu Dhabi, 215 F.3d 247, 253\n(2d Cir.2000) (finding, in context of FSIA\n12(b)(1) motion, conclusory allegations in\nplaintiffs affidavit insufficient to sustain\njurisdiction)). The law does not permit\nPlaintiffs\nto circumvent the jurisdictional hurdle of\nthe FSIA by inserting vague and conclu-\nsory allegations of tortious conduct in\ntheir complaints—and then ... rely on\nthe federal courts to conclude that some\nconceivable non-discretionary tortious\nact falls within the purview of these\ngeneric allegations under the applicable\nsubstantive law. This is at odds with\nthe goal of the FSIA to enable a foreign\ngovernment to obtain an early dismissal\n\nwhen the substance of the claim against\nit does not support jurisdiction.\n\nRobinson, 269 F.3d at 146.\n\nii. Discretionary Function\n\nPlaintiffs argue that there is no discre-\ntion to conduct illegal activities and the\nso-called discretionary function exception\nto the tortious act exception should not\napply to Prince Sultan or Prince Turki.\nSee, eg, Liu v. Republic of China, 892\nF.2d 1419, 1421, 1431 (th Cir.1989) (find-\ning no discretion to violate Chinese law\nprohibiting murder where gunmen acting\non direction of China’s Director of De-\nfense Intelligence Bureau killed plaintiffs\nhusband); Birnbaum v. United States,\n588 F.2d 319, 329-80 (2d Cir.1978) (find-\ning in FTCA case that the CIA had no\nauthority and therefore no discretion to\nopen U.S. first class mail departing for\nand arriving from the Soviet Union);\nGlickman v. United States, 626 F.Supp.\n171, 175 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (finding in FTCA\nease that CIA agent’s secret administra-\ntion of LSD to plaintiff was not discretion-\nary function); Letelier v. Republic of Chi-\nle, 488 F.Supp. 665, 673 (D.D.C.1980)\n(holding no discretion to order or aid as-\nsassination of former Chilean ambassador\nand foreign minister). Prince Sultan in-\nsists that any recommendation of govern-\nment grants to Islamic charities was a\ndiscretionary function. Prince Turki\nmakes a similar argument regarding his\nactions as the head of DGI and urges the\nCourt to find that all of his alleged actions\nshould be subsumed by the discretionary\nfunction exception.\n\n[28] The Court finds the discretionary\nfunction exception independently bars\nPlaintiffs’ claims against Prince Sultan and\nPrince Turki. Both Princes are accused of\ndonating money or recommending govern-\nment grants to charities that allegedly sup-\nported al Qaeda. As the head of DGI,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017866",
