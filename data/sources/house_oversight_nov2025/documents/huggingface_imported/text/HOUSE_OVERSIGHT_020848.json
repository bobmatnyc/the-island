  "text": "Summary\n\nKP\ni USA Inc. | Introduction 13\n\nHighlights from F2010 USA Inc. Financials\n\ne Summary — USA Inc. has challenges.\n\ne Cash Flow — While recession depressed F2008-F2010 results, cash flow has been negative\nfor 9 consecutive years ($4.8 trillion, cumulative), with no end to losses in sight. Negative\ncash flow implies that USA Inc. can't afford the services it is providing to 'customers,’ many\nof whom are people with few alternatives.\n\ne Balance Sheet — Net worth is negative and deteriorating.\n\ne Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities — Off-balance sheet liabilities of at least $31 trillion (primarily\nunfunded Medicare and Social Security obligations) amount to nearly $3 for every $1 of debt\non the books. Just as unfunded corporate pensions and other post-employment benefits\n(OPEB) weigh on public corporations, unfunded entitlements, over time, may increase USA\nInc.’s cost of capital. And today’s off-balance sheet liabilities will be tomorrow’s on-balance\nsheet debt.\n\ne Conclusion — Publicly traded companies with similar financial trends would be pressed by\nshareholders to pursue a turnaround. The good news: USA Inc.’s underlying asset base and\nentrepreneurial culture are strong. The financial trends can shift toward a positive direction,\nbut both ‘management’ and ‘shareholders’ will need collective focus, willpower, commitment,\nand sacrifice.\n\nNote: USA federal fiscal year ends in September, Cash flow = total revenue — total spending on a cash basis; net worth includes\n\nunfunded future liabilities from Social Security and Medicare on an accrual basis over the next 75 years. Source: cash flow per\n\nWhite House Office of Management and Budget; net worth per Dept. of Treasury, “2010 Financial Report of the U.S.\n\nKP Government,” adjusted to include unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare.\n(@E) www.kpcb.com USA inc. | Introduction 14\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020848",
