  "text": "810\n\nCourt declines to adopt this standard.\nThere was no question that, at a minimum,\nthe defendants in these products liability\nactions had substantial contacts with the\nforum, in these cases being New York, and\nwere involved in the sale or production of\nthe products at issue. In re DES Cases,\n789 F.Supp. at 559; Simon, 86 F.Supp.2d\nat 99-100. Here, however, there are ques-\ntions as to the Defendants’ contacts with\nthe forum, whether it be the United States\ngenerally or New York specifically, and\nthe Defendants’ alleged involvement with\nal Qaeda is much more attenuated.\n\nB. Due Process Requirements\n\n[46-49] Any exercise of personal juris-\ndiction must comport with the require-\nments of due process. “The due process\ntest for personal jurisdiction has two relat-\ned components: the ‘minimum contacts’\ninquiry and the ‘reasonableness’ inquiry.”\nMetro. Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson—Ceco\nCorp., 84 F.3d 560, 567 (2d Cir.1996). De-\npending on the basis for personal jurisdic-\ntion, due process under either the Fifth or\nFourteenth Amendment applies. “[TJhe\ndue process analysis is basically the same\nunder both the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments. The principal difference is\nthat under the Fifth Amendment the court\ncan consider the defendant’s contacts\nthroughout the United States, while under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment only the con-\ntacts with the forum state may be consid-\nered.” Chew v. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28\nn. 4 (2d Cir.1998). Here, personal jurisdic-\ntion under the New York long-arm statute\nrequires minimum contacts with New York\npursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe exercise of personal jurisdiction under\nRule 4(k) requires contacts with the Unit-\ned States as a whole pursuant to the Fifth\nAmendment.\n\n1. Minimum Contacts\n\n[50,51] Minimum contacts are re-\nquired so “that the maintenance of the suit\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\ndoes not offend traditional notions of fair\nplay and substantial justice.” Intl Shoe\nCo. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66\nS.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945); see also\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Wood-\nson, 444 U.S. 286, 292, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62\nL.Ed.2d 490 (1980). The minimum con-\ntacts requirement is also known as “fair\nwarning,” such that the defendant’s con-\ntacts with the forum should be sufficient\nto make it reasonable to be haled into\ncourt there. Burger King, 471 U.S. at\n474, 105 S.Ct. 2174. The “ ‘fair warning’\nrequirement is satisfied if the defendant\nhas ‘purposefully directed’ his activities at\nthe residents of the forum ... and the\nlitigation results from alleged injuries that\n‘arise out of or relate to’ those activities.”\nId. (internal citations omitted); see also\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297-\n98, 100 S.Ct. 559 (finding purposefully di-\nrected activities where defendant delivered\nproducts into stream of commerce with ex-\npectation they would be purchased by resi-\ndents of forum); Calder, 465 U.S. at 789-\n90, 104 S.Ct. 1482 (finding publishing ac-\ntivities outside of forum were calculated to\ncause injury to plaintiff in forum where\nshe lived and which also had the highest\nsubscription rate). “Although it has been\nargued that foreseeability of causing wu-\nry in another State should be sufficient to\nestablish such contacts there when policy\nconsiderations so require, the Court has\nconsistently held that this kind of foresee-\nability is not a ‘sufficient benchmark’ for\nexercising personal jurisdiction.” Burger\nKing, 471 US. at 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174\n(quoting World-Wide Volkswagen, 444\nU.S. at 295, 100 S.Ct. 559). In every case,\nthere must be “some act by which the\ndefendant purposefully avails itself of the\nprivilege of conducting activities within the\nforum State, thus invoking the benefits\nand protections of its laws.” Jd.
