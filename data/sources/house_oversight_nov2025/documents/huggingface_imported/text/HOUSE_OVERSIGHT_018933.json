A judge decided\nEpstein owed him nothing.\n\n“Its a bad memory. I would\nrather not have ever met J effrey\nEpstein,” said Michael Stroll, the\nretired former president of Williams\nElectronics and Sega Corp. “Suffice\nit to say I have nothing good to say\nabout him.”\n\nAmong the characteristics most\nattributed to Epstein is a penchant\nfor women.\n\nHe has been linked to Maxwell,\na fixture on the high-society party\ncircuits in both New York and Lon-\ndon. Previous girlfriends are said to\ninclude a former Ms. Sweden and a\nRaia model.\n\n“He’s a lot of fun to be with,”\nDonald Trump told New York maga-\nzine in 2002. “It is even said that he\nlikes beautiful women as much as I\ndo, and many of them are on the\nyounger side. No doubt about it,\nJeffrey enjoys his social life.”\n\nInvestigation leads to Epstein\n\nAlthough he was not a fre\nquenter of the Palm Beach social\nscene, he made his presence felt.\nAmong his charitable donations, he\nee ee to the fam Beach\n\nolice Department and $100,000 t\nBallet Florida, °\n\nIn Palm Beach, he lived in luxu-\n\nry. Three black Mercedes sat in his\n\ngarage, alongside a green Harley-\n\nDavidson. His jet waited at a hangar\nat Palm Beach International Airport.\nAt home, a private chef and a small\nstaff stood at the ready. From a\nwindow in his mansion, he could\nlook out on the Intracoastal Water-\nway and the West Palm Beach sky-\nline. He seemed to be a man who -\nhad everything.\n« But extraordinary wealth can '\n\nweenentente tT Tenn et TET\n\n\\ - fuel extraordinary desires.\n\ni\n\nIn March 2005, a worried mother :\n\nven ' WOntacted Palm Beach police. She\n\nsaid another parent had overheard a\nconversation between their chil-\ndren.\n__ Now the mother was afraid her\n14-year-old daughter had been\n‘ molested by a man on the island.\nThe phone call triggered an\nextensive investigation, one that\n‘ would lead detectives to Epstein but\nleave them frustrated.\n\nPalm Beach police and the state\nattorney's office have declined to\ndiscuss the case. But a Palm Beach\npolice report detailing the criminal\nprobe offers a window into what\ndetectives faced as they sought to\nclose in on Epstein.\n\nDetectives interviewed the girl,\nwho told them a friend had invited\nher to arich man’s house to perform\na massage. She said the friend told\nher to say she was 18 if asked. At the\nhouse, she said she was paid $300\nafter stripping to her panties and\nmassaging the man while he mas-\nturbated. ;\n\nPolice interview 5 alleged victims\n\nThe investigation began in full\nafter the girl identified Epstein in a\nphoto as the man who had paid her.\nPolice arranged for garbage trucks\n\nto set aside Epstein’s trash so police -\n\ncould sift through it. They set up a\nvideo camera to record the comings\nand goings at his home. They mon-\nitored an airport hangar for signs of\nhis private jet’s arrivals and depar-\ntures.\n\nThey quickly learned that the\nwoman who took the 14-year-old girl\nto Epstein’s house was Haley Rob-\nson, a Palm Beach Community Col-\nlege student from Loxahatchee. Ina\nsworn statement at police head-\nquarters, Robson, then 18, admitted\nshe had taken atleast six girls to visit\nEpstein, all between the ages of 14\nand 16. Epstein paid her for each\nvisit, she said.\n\nDuring the drive back to her\n\nhouse, Robson told detectives, “I’m\nlike a Heidi Fleiss.”\n\nPolice interviewed five alleged\n\nvictims and 17 witnesses. Their\nreport shows some of the girls said\nthey had been instructed to have sex\nwith another woman. in front of\nEpstein, and one said she had direct\nintercourse with him.\n\nIn October, police searched the |\n\nPalm Beach mansion. They discov-\nered photos of naked, young-looking\nfemales, just as several of the girls\nhad described in interviews. Hidden\n\ncameras were found in the garage |\n\narea and inside a clock on Epstein’s\n\ndesk, alongside a girl’s high school |\n\ntranscript.\n\nTwo of Epstein’s former\nemployees told investigators that\nyoung-looking girls showed up to\nperform massages two or three\ntimes a day when Epstein was in |\ntown.\n\nThey said the girls were permit-\nted many indulgences. A chef\ncooked for them. Workers gave\nthem rides and handed out hun-\ndreds of dollars at a time.\n\nOne employee told detectives he\nwas told to send a dozen.roses to one\nteenage girl after a high school :\ndrama performance. Others were\ngiven rental cars. One, according to -\npolice, received a $200 Christmas\nbonus.\n\nThe cops moved to cement their\ncase. But as they tried to tighten the\nnoose, they encountered other\nforces at work.\n\nIn Orlando they interviewed a\npossible victim who told them noth-\ning inappropriate had happened\nbetween her and Epstein. They\nasked her whether she had spoken\n\nto anyone else. She said yes, a pri-\n\nvate investigator had asked her the\nsame questions.\n\nWhen they subpoenaed one of\nEpstein’s former employees, he told\nthem the same thing. He and a pri- |\nvate eye had met ata restaurant days\nearlier to go over what the man\nwould tell investigators.\n\nDetectives received complaints\nthat private eyes were posing as\npolice officers. When they told\nEpstein’s local attorney, Guy Frons-\ntin, he said the investigators worked |\nfor Roy Black, the high-powered |\nMiami lawyer who has defended the |\nlikes of Rush Limbaugh and William\nKennedy Smith.\n\nWhile the private eyes were\nconducting a parallel investigation,\nDershowitz, the Harvard law pro- |\nfessor, traveled to West Palm Beach\nwith information about the girls.\nFrom their own profiles on the pop- .\nular Web site MySpace.com, he\nobtained copies of their discussions\nabout their use of alcohol and mari-\njuana.\n\nHe took his research to a meet-\ning with prosecutors. in early 2006,\nwhere he sought to cast doubt on the\nteens’ reliability.\n~~ The private eyes had dug up\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018933",
