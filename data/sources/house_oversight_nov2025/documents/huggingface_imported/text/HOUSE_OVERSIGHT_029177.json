  "text": "RLK: So there’s a significant impact [on the\nUS]. The US hope is that China will be\npressured to make changes in its policy. Now\nthe [tariff] policy is not just [targeting] the\ntrade deficit. The policies are, what are called,\nChina’s closed market, intellectual property\nprotection, industrial espionage, tech transfers\nand JVs (to get the Chinese market) and\ngovernment support for tech. And for each of\nthese, China has responses. China says it was\ndoing what was appropriate under the WTO\nbecause it was a developing country. Now that\nit’s advanced, it’s opening markets.\n\nChina has a “negative list” telling people\n[companies] what it cannot do, making it much\neasier; China is also opening further in autos\nand financial services. But they need to be\npushed more. Even economists in China\nrecognize that, that coming out of this, if we\nhave cool heads and smart brains, both sides\ncan be better off.\n\nHOST: So are there other ways to do this? You\nlisted that Trump wants to close a trade deficit.\nHe’s hitting back at these closed markets. He\nwants to prevent the stealing of intellectual\nproperty.
