  "text": "Two days later, to the dismay of Obama--who told a town hall\nmeeting that he was restricted because the “Don’ t ask, don’ t tell”\npolicy was written into law, adding, “This is not a situation where | can, by\nthe stroke of a pen, end this policy” --he wanted Congress to repeal it\nafter the November midterm election, but Federal Judge Virginia Phillips\nupset that timetable by issuing an immediate and permanent ban on what\nshe considered to be unconstitutional. This ruling was not a spoof, though\nit was treated as one by an appeals court that set aside her injunction. In\nDecember 2010, Congress repealed the 17-year-old law.\n\nNor was it a spoof when Attorney General Holder—having been\npressured by nine former DEA chiefs, plus the president of Mexico--\nwarned that if Prop. 19 was passed, making California the first state to\nlegalize pot, the federal government would not look the other way, as it\nhas done with medical marijuana. Holder (who wouldn’ t prosecute the\nBush administration for promulgating torture) explained:\n\n“Let me state clearly that the Department of Justice strongly\nopposes Proposition 19. If passed, this legislation will greatly complicate\nfederal drug enforcement efforts to the detriment of our citizens. We will\n\nvigorously enforce the [law] against those individuals and organizations\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015329",
