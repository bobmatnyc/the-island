  "text": "Escape from zero\n\nThe Q3 CY16 GDP print confirms our view that Japan has at last emerged from the de\nfacto zero-growth trap of the past few years. Growth accelerated to an above-\nconsensus 2.2% q-o-q Saar, after a 0.7% rise in Q2 CY16 and 2.1% rise in Q1 CY16. We\nexpect a moderation in Q4 CY16, but underlying growth will remain firmly in the 1.0-\n1.5% range. We are currently tracking CY2016 growth of 0.7%, a modest improvement\nfrom 0.6% in CY2015, though the switch to a new GDP standard’ next month raises\nuncertainty around our forecasts.\n\nUpturn in exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17\n\nThe recent recovery has been driven by a fading consumption tax shock and stronger\nexports. The downturn in the global industrial cycle in 2014-16 hurt Japan, but\nmanufacturing activity bottomed out early this year and is now modestly expanding\n(Chart 2). The OECD leading indicator continues to signal a synchronized pick-up in\nglobal growth (Chart 3). The domestic inventory cycle also points to production gains\nahead (Chart 4). For Japanese exporters, the improvement in demand has been most\nvisible for Europe (Chart 5). US and Chinese demand will likely follow, though the\nmainland’s structural shift to services implies only a modest acceleration. We expect the\ncurrent up-cycle in global exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17 — possibly longer\ndepending on developments in the US (more on this later). The combination of stronger\nexternal demand and a weaker currency should shore up business confidence, especially\namong manufacturers, and lay the foundations of Japan’s recovery.\n\nChart 2: Industrial activity has bottomed out Chart 3: OECD leading indicator points to modest global expansion\nIndex 2010=100 3mma sa a\n110 6\n105 “\n2\n100 0\n95 By,\n90 4\n85 6\n\n2010 2011 «2012-S«2013-S«« 2014-2015 = 2016 «2047 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\n\n== OECD global leading indicator, %YoY (LHS)\n== Japan real exports, %YoY (RHS)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, OECD, Bo}\n\n——|P -———Real exports\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, METI, Bo}\n\nChart 4: The shipment-inventory cycle points to production gains ahead Chart 5: Japan's real exports by destination, 3mma %YoY\n10 50\n40\n5\n> 30\noO\n> 20\n<0\n# 10\n®\n5\nBee Mar 2013\n419 220 -20\n-10 5 0 5 10 2010 2011 2012-2013, 2014. 2015 = 2016\nInventories %YoY aN.
