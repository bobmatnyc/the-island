  "text": "Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price\nof oil and to the politics of the Middle East, entertained\nthat evening a delegation from Qatar, including Sheikh\nHamad Bin Jassim, the foreign minister. Hamad ,\nindeed, lives across the street in a similarly furnished\nhouse—he and Epstein have the same decorator.\nEpstein, in his relaxed and amused manner, kept\nprodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What\ndo you get out of that?” The Qatarians, in some mild\ndiplomatic discomfort, seemed most worried that their\nbid for the World Cup might be compromised by\nbribery allegations.\n\nAt 9 the next morning, Epstein was joined for\nbreakfast in the dining room by Reid Weingarten, who’s\nrepresented, among other fat cats in trouble,\nWorldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd\nBlankfein, and is one of attorney general Eric Holder’s\nclosest friends. Weingarten, hoarse, with a cold, and\ndejected, is just back from a failed defense of former\nConnecticut Governor John Rowland.\n\nAfter a blow by blow of the trial, there’s a\ndiscussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving\nchocolate made from pistachios grown on the Sheikh’s\nfarm—and speculation about who actually controls\nISIS, with Weingarten arguing that the Turks are not\ngetting enough scrutiny (he posits that ISIS is part of\ntheir proxy war against the Kurds). There is, in\nEpstein’s dining room, always an alternative version of\nworld events—” “perception versus reality,” says\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022871",
