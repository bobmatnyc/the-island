  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n835\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs claim that mem-\nbers of the Spanish al Qaeda cell used\nArab Bank to make wire transfers. Bur-\nnett Complaint 1138 (alleging Arab Bank\nis “used regularly by al Qaeda’s Spanish\ncell for transfers of cash to members of al\nQaeda operating in Germany, Pakistan, Af-\nghanistan, Lebanon, Yemen, Bosnia, and\nelsewhere”); id. 99139, 528 (alleging\n$6,400 wire transfer through Arab Bank\nfrom member of Spanish al Qaeda cell to\nan extremist associated with Chej Salah in\nSpain). These Plaintiffs conclude that\n“Arab Bank PLC has materially sup-\nported, aided, and abetted and financed al\nQaeda.” Id. 1138.\n\nThe Federal and Burnett complaints do\nnot include any facts to support the infer-\nence that Arab Bank knew or had to know\nthat it was providing material support to\nterrorists by providing financial services to\nthe charity Defendants or by processing\nwire transfers in Spain. The paragraphs\ndo not allege any involvement by, knowl-\nedge of, or participation in any wrongful\nconduct by Arab Bank. These Plaintiffs do\nnot claim that Arab Bank ignored any\nregulations regarding their customer ac-\ncounts. Providing routine banking ser-\nvices, without having knowledge of the ter-\nrorist activities, cannot subject Arab Bank\nto liability. While claiming Arab Bank has\nties with known Hamas fronts, the Federal\ncomplaint does not contain any allegation\nof a connection between Hamas and Osa-\nma bin Laden, al Qaeda, or the September\n11 attacks. A complaint alleging conclu-\nsions without supporting facts will not sur-\nvive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. In re Cross\nMedia Mktg. Corp. Sec. Intig, 314\nF.Supp.2d 256, 261 (S.D.N.Y.2004). The\nFederal Plaintiffs asked for leave to amend\ntheir complaint with respect to Arab Bank,\nbut they have not offered any facts to\nsupport an amendment. Therefore, Arab\nBank’s motions to dismiss the Federal and\n\nBurnett complaints are granted in their\nentirety.\n\n4.
