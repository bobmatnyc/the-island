  "text": "Epstein can find himself echoing aspects of\nThomas Piketty on the inequities of the accumulation of\nwealth (“the divide is between people with assets, which\nappreciate, and people without assets, who fail to\nadvance—that is, of course, the miracle of compounded\ninterest’), except for the fact that Epstein, knowing the\nrich, understands a point that Piketty doesn’t: “Nobody,\nnobody, wants to give it all to their children.

Not long ago, when I met him for lunch in New\nYork, he noted that he hadn’t been out to lunch in a\nrestaurant in ten years. It was a not particularly pleasant\nexperience for him and we were done in 30 minutes.\n\nOn the other hand, Epstein’s life sometimes seems\npart of a purposeful challenge: not just look at me, but\ndo you even believe what you see?
