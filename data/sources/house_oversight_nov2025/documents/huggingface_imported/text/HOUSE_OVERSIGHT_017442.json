  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nWhat changed? In Waterstones one day I found myself in the Israel and Palestine section.\nTo this day I don't know why I actually pulled it off the shelf, but I picked up a copy of\nAlan Dershowitz's The Case for Israel.\n\nIn my world view the Jews and the Americans controlled the media, so after a brief look at\nthe back, I scoffed thinking \"vile Zionist propaganda\".\n\nBut I decided to buy it, eagerly awaiting the chance to deconstruct it so I could show why\nIsrael had no case and claim my findings as a personal victory for the Palestinian cause.\nAs I read Dershowitz's systematic deconstruction of the lies I had been told, I felt a real\ncrisis of conscience. I couldn't disprove his arguments or find facts to respond to them\nwith. I didn't know what to believe. I'd blindly followed for so long, yet here I was\nquestioning whether I had been wrong?\n\nI decided to visit Israel to find the truth. I was confronted by synagogues, mosques and\nchurches, by Jews and Arabs living together, by minorities playing huge parts in all areas\nof Israeli life, from the military to the judiciary. It was shocking and eye-opening. This\nwasn't the evil Zionist Israel that I had been told about.\n\nAfter much soul searching, I knew what I had once believed was wrong. I had to stand\nwith Israel, with this tiny nation, free, democratic, making huge strides in medicine,\nresearch and development, yet the victim of the same lies and hatred that nearly consumed\nme.\n\nNot all people were so positively influenced, a woman in England asked the manager of a large\nbook store for a copy of Zhe Case For Israel. He responded, “there is no case for Israel.”\n\nI have devoted much of my 7\" decade to the defense of Israel (while continuing to criticize many\nof its policies, especially regarding settlements.) This has earned me the title of “the Jewish\nState’s lead attorney in the court of public opinion” and “America’s most public Jewish defender.”\nIt has also earned me the title of “Ziofascist,” “Jewish Nazi,” “tool of the Likud,” and “Israel\nFirster.”\n\nIt is these latter titles that have brought about the most recent change in my life during my 8\"\ndecade. Until recently, I was always known as a liberal Democrat aligned politically with the likes\nof Senator Ted Kennedy, President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senator\nHubert Humphrey, Justices Arthur Goldberg and William Brennan, the Reverend Martin Luther\nKing, and Judge David Bazelon. The organization with which I have been most closely\nassociated has been the American Civil Liberties Union, on whose national and local boards I\nhave served. The causes with which I have been most often associated were freedom of speech;\nopposition to the death penalty; due process for criminal suspects and defendants; the separation\nof church and state; racial, gender, religious, wealth and sexual orientation equality; and political\naccountability . Indeed, when I have been considered for judgeships and other government\npositions requiring Senate confirmation, I was generally regarded as “too liberal” to be confirmed.\n\n355\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017442",
