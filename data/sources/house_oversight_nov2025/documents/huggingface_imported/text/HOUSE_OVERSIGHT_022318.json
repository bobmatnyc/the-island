  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54047\n\nemployees concerning personnel rules\nor policies are customarily posted.\nWhere 20 percent or more of an\nemployer’s workforce is not proficient\nin English and speaks a language other\nthan English, the employer must post\nthe notice in the language employees\nspeak. If an employer’s workforce\nincludes two or more groups\nconstituting at least 20 percent of the\nworkforce who speak different\nlanguages, the employer must either\nphysically post the notice in each of\nthose languages or, at the employer’s\noption, post the notice in the language\nspoken by the largest group of\nemployees and provide each employee\nin each of the other language groups a\ncopy of the notice in the appropriate\nlanguage. If an employer requests from\nthe Board a notice in a language in\nwhich it is not available, the requesting\nemployer will not be liable for non-\ncompliance with the rule until the\nnotice becomes available in that\nlanguage. An employer must take\nreasonable steps to ensure that the\nnotice is not altered, defaced, covered\nby any other material, or otherwise\nrendered unreadable.\n\n(e) Obtaining a poster with the\nemployee notice. A poster with the\nrequired employee notice, including a\nposter with the employee notice\ntranslated into languages other than\nEnglish, will be printed by the Board,\nand may be obtained from the Board’s\noffice, 1099 14th Street, NW.,\nWashington, DC 20570, or from any of\nthe Board’s regional, subregional, or\nresident offices. Addresses and\ntelephone numbers of those offices may\nbe found on the Board’s Web site at\nhttp://www.nirb.gov. A copy of the\nposter in English and in languages other\nthan English may also be downloaded\nfrom the Board’s Web site at http://\nwww.nirb.gov. Employers also may\nreproduce and use copies of the Board’s\nofficial poster, provided that the copies\nduplicate the official poster in size,\ncontent, format, and size and style of\ntype. In addition, employers may use\ncommercial services to provide the\nemployee notice poster consolidated\nonto one poster with other Federally\nmandated labor and employment\nnotices, so long as the consolidation\ndoes not alter the size, content, format,\nor size and style of type of the poster\nprovided by the Board.\n\n(f) Electronic posting of employee\nnotice. (1) In addition to posting the\nrequired notice physically, an employer\nmust also post the required notice on an\nintranet or internet site if the employer\ncustomarily communicates with its\nemployees about personnel rules or\npolicies by such means. An employer\nthat customarily posts notices to\nemployees about personnel rules or\npolicies on an intranet or internet site\nwill satisfy the electronic posting\nrequirement by displaying\nprominently—i.e., no less prominently\nthan other notices to employees—on\nsuch a site either an exact copy of the\nposter, downloaded from the Board’s\nWeb site, or a link to the Board’s Web\nsite that contains the poster. The link to\nthe Board’s Web site must read,\n“Employee Rights under the National\nLabor Relations Act.”\n\n(2) Where 20 percent or more of an\nemployer’s workforce is not proficient\nin English and speaks a language other\nthan English, the employer must\nprovide notice as required in paragraph\n(f)(1) of this section in the language the\nemployees speak. If an employer's\nworkforce includes two or more groups\nconstituting at least 20 percent of the\nworkforce who speak different\nlanguages, the employer must provide\nthe notice in each such language. The\nBoard will provide translations of the\nlink to the Board’s Web site for any\nemployer that must or wishes to display\nthe link on its Web site. If an employer\nrequests from the Board a notice in a\nlanguage in which it is not available, the\nrequesting employer will not be liable\nfor non-compliance with the rule until\nthe notice becomes available in that\nlanguage.\n\n§ 104.203 Are Federal contractors covered\nunder this part?\n\nYes, Federal contractors are covered.\nHowever, contractors may comply with\nthe provisions of this part by posting the\nnotices to employees required under the\nDepartment of Labor’s notice-posting\nrule, 29 CFR part 471.\n\n§ 104.204 What entities are not subject to\nthis part?\n\n(a) The following entities are\nexcluded from the definition of\n“employer” under the National Labor\nRelations Act and are not subject to the\nrequirements of this part:\n\nTABLE TO § 104.204\n\n(1) The United States or any wholly\nowned Government corporation;\n\n(2) Any Federal Reserve Bank;\n\n(3) Any State or political subdivision\nthereof;\n\n(4) Any person subject to the Railway\nLabor Act;\n\n(5) Any labor organization (other than\nwhen acting as an employer); or\n\n(6) Anyone acting in the capacity of\nofficer or agent of such labor\norganization.\n\n(b) In addition, employers employing\nexclusively workers who are excluded\nfrom the definition of ‘“‘employee”’\nunder § 104.201 are not covered by the\nrequirements of this part.\n\n(c) This part does not apply to entities\nover which the Board has been found\nnot to have jurisdiction, or over which\nthe Board has chosen through regulation\nor adjudication not to assert\njurisdiction.\n\n(d)(1) This part does not apply to\nentities whose impact on interstate\ncommerce, although more than de\nminimis, is so slight that they do not\nmeet the Board’s discretionary\njurisdiction standards. The most\ncommonly applicable standards are:\n\n(i) The retail standard, which applies\nto employers in retail businesses,\nincluding home construction. The Board\nwill take jurisdiction over any such\nemployer that has a gross annual\nvolume of business of $500,000 or more.\n\n(ii) The nonretail standard, which\napplies to most other employers. It is\nbased either on the amount of goods\nsold or services provided by the\nemployer out of state (called ‘“‘outflow’’)\nor goods or services purchased by the\nemployer from out of state (called\n“inflow’’). The Board will take\njurisdiction over any employer with an\nannual inflow or outflow of at least\n$50,000. Outflow can be either direct—\nto out-of-state purchasers—or indirect—\nto purchasers that meet other\njurisdictional standards. Inflow can also\nbe direct—purchased directly from out\nof state—or indirect—purchased from\nsellers within the state that purchased\nthem from out-of-state sellers.\n\n(2) There are other standards for\nmiscellaneous categories of employers.\nThese standards are based on the\nemployer’s gross annual volume of\nbusiness unless stated otherwise. These\nstandards are listed in the Table to this\nsection.\n\nEmployer category\n\nJurisdictional standard\n\nAmusement industry\nApartment houses, condominiums, cooperatives\nArchitects\n\n$500,000.\n$500,000.\nNonretail standard.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022318",
