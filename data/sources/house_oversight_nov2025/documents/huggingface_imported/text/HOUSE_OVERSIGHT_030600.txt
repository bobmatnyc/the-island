Dear Ghislaine

Below is a link to today's Mail.

The allegations are getting worse - this is not astorm you can ride by not making any statement out and get
your life back. You have friends saying they don't believe you would act in this way and you need to say that you
did not.

The Mail website is read by 193 million | don't see how a statement denying the allegations will make matters
worse which is the acid test. It will make your position better as you will astrong open denial on record. These
allegations must not gain traction.

| wont say anymore as | have given my advice - call me.

Best

Philip
