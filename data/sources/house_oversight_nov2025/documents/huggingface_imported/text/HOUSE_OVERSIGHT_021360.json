  "text": "God spoke also through circumstances.\nWhat a skeptic might interpret as\ncoincidence is understood as God’s\nintentional decision to direct the\ncongregant’s attention. For example:\n\n“Everything in my life right now is\nfocused on trying to get to England, and\nI needed to get some ID pictures. So I\nwas really anxious—the money hasn’t\nreally come together—and one afternoon\nI just felt like God said, you need to get\nup and go get those. Go get those ID\npictures that you need. I was like, that’s\ntotally inefficient. I don’t have a car, so\nit’s like walking half an hour to\nWalgreens and another half an hour\nback. Like, I could do this later and\ncombine it with several things I need to\nget done. But I felt it was a step of faith\nto do this thing. So I did it—grumbling.\nThen on the way there and back I ran\ninto three people I knew, and I felt that\nthere was a kind of pattern, and that I\nwas in the right place at the right time.”\n\nThese ways of recognizing God are\nwidely shared in many forms of\nChristianity. More specific to\nexperiential evangelical Christianity is\nthe expectation that God will speak\ndirectly into the mind, by placing a\nmental image or thought or sensation\nthere. For example:\n\n“T’m praying for someone and, you\nknow, they say their situation, what they\nwant me to pray for. I start praying and\nstart trying to, you know, really\nexperience God, and, you know, I see\nthese vivid images, and I’m explaining\nthese vivid images and what I think they\nmean and, you know, sort of checking in\nwith the person, you know, does this\n\n114\n\nPage\n\nresonate with you? They’re like “oh, my\ngosh, yes! How did you know that?”\n\nMost congregants find this process of\npulling out specific thoughts and\nascribing them to God baffling at first:\nagain, the process violates the basic\nhuman experience that the mind is\nprivate. A congregant commented: “now\nI know that the ‘something’ is God,\nGod’s voice. But I didn’t at all have\nwords to describe it at that time I didn’t\nunderstand. It was very confusing.”\n\nThe social world of the church\ntaught specific ways to differentiate\nbetween mental events that are God and\nthat are not. This technique has been\ntaught in the church since the earliest\ntime as “discernment,” although the\ncontent of the word and its rules has\nvaried with the era. In the modern\nexperiential evangelical church, the rules\nof discernment are more often taught by\nexample and gossip than explicitly.\nNevertheless, there appeared to be four\nprinciples. A thought might be said to\ncome from God if: the thought was\nunexpected; the thought was consonant\nwith God’s nature; the congregant had\nadditional confirmation (one “tested” the\nthought); and one felt peace during the\nexperience. The process was understood\nto be ambiguous, and left room not only\nfor the congregant to be wrong, but for\ndifferent congregants to disagree about\nwhether God had, in fact, spoken in a\nparticular manner. One afternoon, a\nwoman spoke in front of the church\nexplaining that God had spoken to her\nand told her that she should carry out\nsome mission work in a lovely part of\nMexico. The man sitting next to me said\ndrily, “God sure wants a lot of\nevangelizing in Puerto Vallarta.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021360",
