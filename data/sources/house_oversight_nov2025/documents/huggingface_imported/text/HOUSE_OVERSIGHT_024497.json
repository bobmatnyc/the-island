Early Childhood Education’s Role in the Economy\n\nECE enables people to pursue income-generating activities by allowing parents to participate in the\nworkforce and contribute to the economy. A recent study found that every dollar spent on the formal ECE\nsector generates approximately 15 dollars worth of additional earnings by parents. Furthermore,\nevidence suggests that regardless of family income, children who have participated in ECE programs do\nbetter in school than their peers who did not. ECE also reduces social and economic costs by lowering\nschool dropout rates, and leads to decreased levels of criminal activity. These social and demographic\nforces have established ECE as a fundamental component of today’s economic ‘infrastructure’ and a\nsource of economic growth.\n\nGiven these and other supporting facts, education is an industry that is of growing importance to the\neconomy. This growth is driven by the following factors:\n\n™ Growing public_awareness of the importance of early childhood education. ECE has received\nincreased media and government attention as scientific research highlights the importance of\neducation during a child’s early developmental years. Children who attend high quality ECE centers\ndemonstrate greater mathematical ability, thinking and attention skills, and fewer behavioral problems\nthroughout their educational lives, when compared with children receiving no or lower quality care.\nThese differences hold true for children from a range of family backgrounds.”\n\n™ Favorable demographic trends. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the annual\nnumber of live births in the U.S. was approximately 4.1 million in 2003, compared to approximately 3.6\nmillion in 1980, and the U.S. Census Bureau projects the annual number of live births to increase to\napproximately 4.5 million in 2015.” The number of children aged five years or under grew from\napproximately 22.5 million in 1990 to approximately 23.4 million in 2002, according to the U.S. Census\nBureau, and is projected to reach 26.8 million in 2015,”\n\nNumber of Live Births in the U.S.\n\n4,500\n3 4,250\ni=\n&\n\n3 4,000\n\no\n\n=\n\n= 3,750\n3,500\n\n1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007E 2009E 2011E 2013E 2015E\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nB Changing workforce composition. A rising percentage of women participate in the workforce due to an\nincreasingly higher cost of living, a desire for financial independence and an elevated standard of\nliving preference, which necessitates two full-time wage earners for most families. Of the nearly 65\nmillion jobs created nationally between 1964 and 1997, 40 million were occupied by women. Today,\nmore than 62% of mothers with children under the age of six work full-time compared to 19% in 1960.\n\n22 Source; Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005.\n\n23 Source: The National Economic Impacts of the Child Care Sector, 2002.\n\n* Source: The Children of the Cost, Quality, and Outcomes Study Go To School, 1999.\n\n2° Source: Population Projections Branch, U.S. Census Bureau, “U.S. Interim Projections by Age, Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin,” May 2004.\n\n64\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024497",
