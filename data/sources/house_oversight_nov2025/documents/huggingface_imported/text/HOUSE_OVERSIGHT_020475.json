Earlier legislation had established the Congressional-Executive Commission\n\non China, focused on human rights conditions in China (a perennial negative aspect\n\nin US-China relations), and the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission,\nwhich was known for its annual report listing a variety of developments in China seen\n\nas adverse to US interests and values. While the latter two commissions continue to be\nactive, are robust, and have growing impact, many of the other exchange mechanisms\nhave proven less than durable. Once the leading members who founded such groups leave\nCongress, interest usually wanes. The National People’s Congress became even more active\nin supporting the growing number of congressional staff delegations to China during\n\nthis period. In 2018, the House China Working Group remained active, but the House\nCongressional China Caucus and the Senate China Working Group were inactive.\n\nMost recently, the 115th Congress has actively embraced the Trump administration’s view\nthat China has benefited more from the bilateral relationship than has the United States.\nIn fact, amidst all the partisan warfare currently dividing Republicans and Democrats in\nWashington, a skepticism about China’s intentions and reliability and a willingness to\npush back in a bipartisan manner against its un-reciprocal, and sometimes even predatory,\npolicies, is one of the most surprising phenomena. In 2018, for example, the Congress\nunanimously passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages the Trump administration to\nhost more high-ranking officials from Taiwan, a move that angered Beijing. Still, Congress is\nhardly united, even on trade. Some members have objected to the adverse impacts punitive\ntariffs are having on their constituencies, or they have opposed imposing tariffs on allies\nat the same time tariffs are imposed on China. And some members criticized President\nTrump’s decision in May 2018 to ease harsh sanctions against the prominent Chinese\nhigh-technology firm ZTE, in response to a personal plea from the Chinese president.\nNevertheless, President Trump’s dominance in the Republican Party means that few in the\nRepublican ranks controlling Congress are inclined to oppose him, especially on China.\nIndeed, Congress is generally endorsing the most significant reevaluation of American-\nChina policy since the start of normalization fifty years ago. As such, it can be said that\nChinese influence on Capitol Hill has reached a low point.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nCongress is in the midst of a major reevaluation of the very assumptions underlying\n\nthe decades-old American policy of “engagement” with China. Because of this increasingly\ncompetitive, even adversarial, new climate, Chinese influence and information operations\nare widely coming to be seen as expressions of a political system whose values are\nantithetical to those of the United States and as a threat to the integrity of Congress and\nour democracy.
