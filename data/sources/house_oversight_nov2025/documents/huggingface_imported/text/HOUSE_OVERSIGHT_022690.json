One firm bringing some of those cases employed a young lawyer named Bradley\nEdwards, who managed some of the cases. In 2009, a founding partner at the firm, Scott Rothstein, fled the country before\nultimately returning to plead guilty of running a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme built around recruiting investors to buy stakes in litigation\n\nsettlements that turned out to be phony.\n\nAs details of the fraud emerged, Epstein sued Rothstein and Edwards in Palm Beach County Court for racketeering, alleging, among\nother things, that they dangled Bill Clinton’s association with Epstein as a lure to investors, implying that settlements would be fast\nand sizable. Epstein ultimately dropped his suit in 2012, but by that time, Edwards had countersued for malicious prosecution and\n\nabuse of process.\n\nThat case, along with a claim by Virginia Roberts against the federal government over the 2007 prosecution deal in district court\n(which she filed as a “Jane Doe” in 2008), are still pending and are the source of most of the scant information about Clinton that\nhas appeared. Scarola, who in the past sued Chiquita over payments to violent leftist Colombian rebels and won a $1.45 billion\nverdict over Morgan Stanley (that was later overturned), is the lawyer bringing the suit in county court in West Palm Beach, while\nPaul Cassell, a former federal judge known for his critical take on mandatory-minimum sentences, mans the federal case four blocks\n\naway.\nNeither Cassell nor Edwards responded to requests for comment.\n\nIt is primarily from pleadings in those cases that the press has been getting a glimpse inside the lifestyle of Epstein, and, by\n\nextension, Clinton. “Edwards had sound legal basis for believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable information,”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022690",
