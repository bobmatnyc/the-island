But none\nof those will ever make it into the sacred group of math, science, Eng-\nlish, economics, and history because everyone seems to think that the\nbig five were handed down on tablets to Moses.\n\nAnd everyone is sure that their favorite subject is the most impor-\ntant one, be it history, literature, math, or science. Math and science\nare having a big moment as I write this. We hear that the nation does\nnot produce enough students interested in math and science. Some-\nthing must be done.\n\nI was a math major in college. I got 98 on every math Regents test\noffered. (I lived in New York where testing ruled in the world in the\n1950s too.) My mother always asked where the other two points went.\nI grew up to be a computer science professor. Iam not a math phobe.\nBut neither am I a math proponent. I have never used math in my\nprofessional life.\n\nI always start any discussion on education by asking if the person\nIam talking with knows the quadratic formula. One out of one hun-\ndred knows it. (The last few times I asked, the people included the\nhead of a major testing service, the governor of a U.S. state, various\nstate legislators, and 200 high school principals.) Then why do we\nteach this obviously useless piece of information to every student in\nthe world? Because math is important, of course.\n\nWhy?\n\nAs a person who was involved with graduate admissions for 30\nyears at three of the top ten universities in the country, I know what\nthis hysteria is actually about. Nearly all applicants to graduate com-\nputer science programs (which is what I know—but it is true in most\nfields of engineering and science) are foreign nationals. We wonder\nwhy American kids aren’t interested in these fields—which is a reason-\nable enough question. But then we have come up with an extraordi-\nnary answer.\n\nWhat we say is that we must teach math and science better in high\nschool when what we mean is that it would be nice to have some more\nAmerican-born scientists.\n\nDo we really believe that the reason that there are so many foreign\napplicants to U.S. graduate programs is that they teach math and sci-\nence better in other countries? China and India provide most of the\napplicants. They also have most of the world’s people. And many of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023828",
