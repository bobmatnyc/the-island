I realize that being better than those two is no real accomplishment, but “W” at\nleast made the list of good presidents, may be not excellent, and definitely not great, a whole lot more than\nacceptible.\n\n————— oe\n\n60.\nBob Bitchin'\n\nMarch 28, 2014 at 6:46 am — Log in to Reply\n\nCall it paranoid, call it conspiracy theory, call it what you watch. I wouldn’t be one bit surprised to find out that\nthere is/are a puppet master/group of puppet masters in the shadows pushing these douche bag politicians at us\nand giving us the illusion that there is a difference in their politics and philosophies when in reality they are all\nthe same just doing their master’s biding. They will push this liberal agenda just far enough to the edge of the\ncliff then pull back and give us back the conservative government so we can take retributions on the liberals for\ntheir treasonous behavior. Heads will roll, asses will get kicked, gays & blacks will once again be of no\nconsequence and the illegals will be run out of the country. Once things have calmed down, they will change\nthe politics again and the beat goes on.\n\nSSS wee\n\n61.\nwillyrho\nMarch 28, 2014 at 7:06 am — Log in to Reply\n\nWe knew this when Monica Lewinski “with the Blue Dress with the Semen on it” exposed Billy Clinton, in the\nWhite Hoer House in DC, he had a B.J. with Monica Under the Desk in the Oval Office when he was\nimpeached, but the Nat See Senate would not convict the Pedophile mur-derer of Vince Foster.\n\nBut we see with the new charges coming against the Felon, Hairy Reid, who takes Bribes and Steals as the\nDemoNatSee Leader of the Nat See Controlled Senate.\n\nAll DemoFascistCrats are Lawless and EVIL.\n\nTo think that Ronald Reagan would not remove his Suite Jacket in the Oval Office because he had such respect\nand Admiration of the Oval Office. And the DemoNatSees/Fascists/Marxist/Muslims now in the White House\nSuck...\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022645",
