  "text": "irreversibly impoverish our biosphere. Extinction rates are rising — we’re destroying\nthe book of life before we’ve read it.\n\nBiodiversity is a crucial component of long-term human wellbeing. We're clearly\nharmed if fish stocks dwindle to extinction; there are plants in the rain forest whose\ngene pool might be useful to us. But for many environmentalists , preserving the\nrichness of our biosphere has value in its own right, over and above what it means to\nus humans To quote the great ecologist EO Wilson ‘mass extinction is the sin that\nfuture generations will least forgive us for’.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nSo the world’s getting more crowded. And there’s a second firm prediction: it will\ngradually get warmer. In contract to population issues, climate change is certainly\nnot under-discussed — though it is under-acted-upon\n\nThe famous Keeling curve shows how the concentration of CO2 in the air is rising,\nmainly due to the burning of fossil fuels .\n\nThe fifth IPCC report presented temperature- projections, for different assumptions\nabout future rates of fossil fuel use. For each such assumption there’s a spread\nbevause it remains unclear how much the climatic effects of CO2 are amplified by\nassociated changes in water vapour and clouds — the so-called sensitivity factor.\n\nIPCC PROJECTIONS\n\nBut despite these uncertainties the science tells is that under ‘business as usual’\nscenarios we can’t rule out, by 2100, really catastrophic warming, and tipping points\ntriggering long-term trends like the melting of Greenland’s icecap.\n\nSadly, many deny this. But even among those who accept that this threat is real,\nthere is a range of views. These stem from differences in economics and ethics -- in\nparticular, in how much obligation we should feel towards future generations.\n\nBjorn Lomberg’s Copenhagen Consensus, for instance applies commercial-style\ndiscounting -- and in effect writes off what happens beyond 2050. So, unsurprisingly\nhe downplays the priority of addressing climate change in comparison with shorter-\nterm efforts to help the world’s poor.\n\nBut if you care about those who'll live into the 22* century and beyond, then, as\neconomists like Stern and Weizman argue, you deem it worth paying an insurance\n\npremium now, to protect those generations against the worst-case scenarios.\n\nAbove all, it depends on an ethical issue — in optimizing people’s life-chances, should\nwe discriminate on grounds of date of birth?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026734",
