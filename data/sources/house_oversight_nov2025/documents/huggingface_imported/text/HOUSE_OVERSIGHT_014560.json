Roosevelt\nMemorial.

The first two triggers are\nunlikely to occur in 2017, and the third, a shock,\nis not something that we can typically anticipate.\nHowever, we do think that China will be a\n\nsource of downside risk sometime over the next\nthree years.\n\nFirst, as we mentioned in last year’s Outlook,\nthere have been five tightening cycles in the post-\nWWII period that have not triggered a recession.\nFour of those cycles occurred during the three\nlongest recoveries, as shown in Exhibit 24. Those\ncycles have been characterized by an early start\nto the tightening cycle, a slow pace relative to\nhistorical averages (220 basis points per year for\nnonrecessionary tightening and 330 basis points per\nyear in recessionary cycles), low core inflation and\nslack in the labor market. This cycle shares those\ncharacteristics: the tightening cycle started in 2015,\nthe pace has been 25 basis points per year, the core\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) index—\nthe Federal Reserve’s preferred benchmark for\ninflation—is at 1.6% year over year as of November\n2016, and our colleagues in GIR estimate that the\nlabor market still has about 0.3% slack.\n\nSecond, the US economy does not\nsuffer from any imbalances in which one\nsector of the economy has become the\nsole driver of growth or equity market\nreturns. Before the global financial crisis,\nresidential investment as a percentage\nof GDP had peaked at 6.7% in 2005,\ncompared to a long-term average of\n4.7%, and the credit-to-GDP gap as a\nmeasure of nonfinancial sector leverage\nhad peaked at 12.4% in 2007 compared\nto a long-term average of -1%, leading\nto meaningful imbalances. Similarly, in\n2000, technology and telecommunication\nsector valuations were more than three\nstandard deviations higher than the\naverage of other sectors. Such imbalances\ndo not exist in the US at this time.\n\nThird, while we cannot anticipate an\nexternal shock—otherwise it would not\nbe a shock—we do not see imbalances in\nother large economies except in China.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014560",
