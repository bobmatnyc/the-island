Our consciousness is electrically (cybernetically)\nenmeshed, yet we don’t respond as if this human-generated set of elegant simulations had\nits own intelligence.\n\nThe artistic use of cybernetic beings also reminds us that consciousness itself is\nnot just “in here.” It is streaming in and out, harmonizing those sensory, scintillating\nsignals. Mind happens well outside the limits of the cranium (and its simulacrum, the\n“motherboard”). In Mary Catherine Bateson’s paraphrase of her father Gregory’s\nsecond-order cybernetics, mind is material “not necessarily defined by a boundary such\nas an envelope of skin.”°! Parreno pairs the simulations of art with the simulations of\nmathematics to force the Wiener-like point that any such model is not, by itself, just like\nlife. Models are just that—parts of signaling systems constituting “intelligence” only\nwhen their creaturely counterparts engage them in lively meaning making.\nContemporary AI has talked itself into a corner by instrumentalizing and particularizing\ntasks and subroutines, confusing these drills with actual wisdom. The brief cultural\nhistory offered here reminds us that views of data as intelligence, digital nets as “neural,”\nor isolated individuals as units of life, were alien even to Conway’s brute simulation.\n\nWe can stigmatize the stubborn arrogance of current AI as “right cybernetics,” the\npath that led to current automated weapons systems, Uber’s ill-disguised hostility to\nhuman workers, and the capitalist dreams of Google. Now we must turn back to left\ncybernetics—theoretical biologists and anthropologists engaged with a trans-species\nunderstanding of intelligent systems. Gregory Bateson’s observation that corporations\nmerely simulate “aggregates of parts of persons,” with profit-maximizing decisions cut\noff from “wider and wiser parts of the mind,” has never been more timely.*”\n\nThe cybernetic epistemology offered here suggests a new approach. The\nindividual mind is immanent, not only in the body but also in pathways outside the body,\nand there is a larger Mind, of which the individual mind is only a subsystem. This larger\nMind, Bateson holds, is comparable to God, and is perhaps what some people mean by\n“God,” but it is still immanent in the total interconnected social system and planetary\necology. This is not the collective delusion of an exterior “God” who speaks from\noutside human consciousness (this long-seated monotheistic conceit, Bateson suggests,\nleads to views of nature and environment as also outside the “individual” human,\nrendering them as “gifts to exploit”). Rather, Bateson’s “God” is a placeholder for our\nevanescent experience of interacting consciousness-in-the-world: larger Mind as a result\nof inputs and actions that then become inputs for other actions in concert with other\nentities—webs of symbiotic relationships that form patterns we need urgently to sense\nand harmonize with.°?\n\nFrom Tsai in the 1970s to Hershman Leeson in the 1990s to Parreno in 2014,\nartists have been critiquing right cybernetics and plying alternative, embodied,\nenvironmental experiences of “artificial” intelligence. Their artistic use of cybernetic\nbeings offers the wisdom of symbionts experienced in the kinds of poeisis that can be\nachieved in this world: rhythms of signals and intuitive actions that produce the\n\n5!
