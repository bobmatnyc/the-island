Edkor \nThe week in cartoons \nGovernment turns its back \non Jeffrey Epstein's sex victims \nFrom the Sun Sett fine, FL Lauderdale. Fla \nPrivate Imvyers allowed sexual predator Jef-\nfrey Epstein to escape justice. Epstein's new \ndefense team works for the federal gmerninent. \nThe U.S. attorney for the northern district \nof Georgia claimed last week that even though \nprosecutors in South Florida broke the law \n%then they approml an outrageously light se, \ntence for Epstein, the deal must stand. B,ing \nPak may not actually be on Epstein, legal team, \nbut he has placed the Department of Justice on \nEpstein, side. \nan'agrerevIZI; EPstefillietlids a it'll:di; l'Pr=nYt \ninunp, former President Bill ulinton and \nPrince Andrew. Between 1998 and 2., E, \nstein recruited roughly three dozen underage \ngirls — generally from poor and troubled fami-\nlies—to his house in Palm Beach and sexually \nabused them. \nEpstein could have faced fethral sex traffick-\ning charges. He could have faced life in prison. \nInstead, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern Dis-\ntrict of Rorida —Alex Acosta, now Trump, la-\nbor secretary — gave Epstein immunity on fed-\neral charges and allowed him to plead guilty to \nminor state charges. Then-Palm Beach County \nState Attorney Barry K.rischer went along. E, \nstein served 13 months in jail — he was allmked \nout about haff the time — and had to register \nwith die state as a sex offender \nProsecutors never told the victims about the \nagreement Until the signing of that othous \nagreement in 2007, the girls believed the FBI \nwas still investigating \nThe victims challenged the deal, which a, \nplied not j. to Epstein, but also to those who \nrecruited the girls and joined in the abuse. Last \nFebruary, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Matra \nruled that prosecutors Ind violated the Crime \nVictims RigNs Act In criticizing the govern-\nment, Marra noted, \"Epstein worked in concert \nwith others to obtain minors not only f his \nown sexual gratification, but al. for the sental \ngratification of others.\" \nMona then as. attomeys for both sides \nhow he should correct this violation. Pak got \nthe case because Acosta, old office had to 'r-\neuse itself \nPak, idea?The victims could \"confer in pri-\nvote\" with prosecutors about the deal. Prosec, \ntots co. get more trsining in how to consuk \nwith victims. But the deal stands. The victims \ndon't deserve even an apology. \nPak argues that the Crime Victims Rights \nAct contains no provision for undoing the no, \nprosecution agreement which is what the \ntims want. Doing so, Pak claims, could violate \nseparstion of powers. \nThat sounds lilce a waming to Marra — \none he should ignore. Prosecutorial discretion \ndoesn't maner when the action in question \nbreaks the law. Even Pak acknowledges repeat-\nethy that it hopper.. \nThe government, he writ., \"should have \ncommunicated with the victims in a straight-\nfonvard and transparent way,' Pak \"regrets that \nthe manner in which (the government) corn-\nmunicated the resolution of the Epstein case to \nthe victims .11 short.- Prosecutors could have \ncommunicated \"more clearly and direcdy-\nwith die victims.-\nNone of that happened because Acosta, \nKrischer and Epstein's laAryers didn't want the \ndeal to become p.c. The victims might have \ngone public with their complaints. Metha cov-\nerage could have ki. the deal. \nIndeed, the record reflects the lengths to \nwhich Acosta and I.scher sought secrecy. \nAcosta thove from Miami to West Palm Beach \nto meet with Epstein attorney Jay Lefkowitz. \nKrischer wrote to a federal prosecutor, \"Glad \nwe could get this worked out for reasons I won't \nput in writing.\" \nWe acknowledge that Pak di.1 create this \nmess. But his argument insults the public and \nreflects badly on die Department of Justice. \n\"The resolution in this case,- Pak writes, \n\"has led some to conclude that die government \nchose for impropernmasatons not to prosecute \n:IZ'1%iaa=1 ththe Iptrint:liPisaltsitvubestgreenn \nable to avoid talking about it for more than a \ndecade. \nAcosta duc. the issue during his confir-\nmation hearings in Apri12017. Last November, \nThe Miami Herald tan a series on the case that \nfeatured interviews with victims who agreed to \nbe identi.. Acosta refus. to comment. So \ndid I.scher. \nSome might argue that the victims have re-\nceived money from civil lawsuits and should \nmove on. But can there be a price for what E, \nstein and his accomplices did to these women? \nHow ma, other victims are there? Why should \na man who once faced a 52-page indictment be \nable to resume a life of privilege? \n\"While the court cannot (mind the post.\" \nPak argues, \"the ten.. proposed \nby the goverment would \ngive the victims a mean-\nhmagvea theiPrc=tYes t \nheard and to un-\nderstand, if not \n: icoctei ath ed ed xi; \nthis matter-\nUnaccept-\nable is right. \nThe victin, \nlawyers will \nfile their re.-\nt3iers o u Icc \"I a \nMarra to void \nthe agreement \n— This edito-\nria is the opin-\nion of the Stet \nSentinel Editorial \nBoard \nThe Da i y News' opinions are expressed only in its editorials. \nThe opinions expressed in columns, letters, cartoons and guest editorials are those of the particular author or artist \n- \nSome might \nargue that the \nvictims have \nreceived money \nfrom civil \nlawsuits and \nsh OU Id move \non.
