They would rather stick with the distorted images of\nArab stereotypes in their minds.\n\nI need to stress here a very important perception. We are not growing in order to be a model for its highest\nbuilding in the world, best airport, and most luxurious hotel, and the largest seaport and man-made islands.\nThese landmarks and features are unique and famous all over the world. But the Dubai model is beyond that.\nDubai is an Arab city with scarce natural resources but with a clear vision of comprehensive development and\nsocial needs. It is a city that succeeded through its investments in human resources, its unique geographical\nlocation, and its trade expertise. This has enabled us to achieve unmatched growth and to become the focal\nconnection between the East and West. Dubai has proved as well the possibility of coexistence of different\ncultures in an open and tolerant Arab Islamic environment.\n\nDubai’s model, which is part of the UAE model, lies in the success of the economy’s diversification, and in\nsparking the interest of the Arab region and neighboring countries in the information and communication\ntechnology, the e-government and the knowledge economy, and in facilitating access to the people in our region\nto global best practices. Our international experiences in various areas are often on display through exhibitions,\nconferences and other activities.\n\nDubai’s model also lies in proving the viability of investing in the region, of investing specifically in the\nknowledge economy and in human welfare. It has also raised the citizens’ expectations in the region concerning\nlevels of good governance and transparency, and the quality of public services and state-of-the-art\ninfrastructure.\n\nDubai is about providing the highest international standards in education and health systems. It is a city with\nentrepreneurial spirit that entered into international investment areas and bought assets in global ports, airports\nand financial markets. Dubai succeeded in building a global financial center and entering into partnerships with\nreputed financial institutions, and was able to compete globally in the areas of air and sea transport, and\ncharitable initiatives that were created to help developing the less fortunate countries.\n\nThese are some of Dubai’s model features, which has attracted the attention of the world, and enticed the\ninterest of the Arab region and its people, and inspired many people and motivated them. Is this the model that\nour critics are targeting?\n\nI asked my brothers and myself this question and I did not expect a reply, because we are accustomed in the\nUAE to respond by work, not words. We believe in God and we have full faith and confidence in Him and in\nour people and businessmen and the many other believers in Dubai.\n\nAbu Dhabi is also witnessing an attack since it succeeded in leading a successful Arab union and launched\ninitiatives of a strategic and impo rtant nature such as “Masdar City.”. I know that the international media have\ncovered art initiatives in Abu Dhabi, including building an outpost of the Louvre. But one gets the impression\nthat even in such coverage of important initiatives, there’s invariably some reference or the other to discredited\nstereotypes of the Arab Gulf. Now the focus is on Dubai, and again the stereotypes are being brought up. It\nseems that any successful Arab model in economic development invites such negative treatment in the\ninternational media\n\nTo be fair, we read recently a few balanced articles reporting on what is the UAE doing regarding the effect of\n\nthe global financial crisis on our region.\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, the media campaign has focused on pointing that Dubai is facing an\neconomic crisis threatening the foundations of its economic development.
