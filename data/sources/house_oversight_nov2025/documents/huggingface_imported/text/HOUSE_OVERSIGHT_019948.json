  "text": "piecemeal renovations—as well as a famous roach and rodent problem—to be vexing and\neven a little scary. Friends who admired his skills as a hotelier wondered why he just\ndidn’t remake the place, but he seemed cowed by the weight of the watchful eyes on him.\n\nKellyanne Conway, whose family had remained in New Jersey, and who had\nanticipated that she could commute home when the president went back to New York, was\nsurprised that New York and Trump Tower were suddenly stricken from his schedule.\nConway thought that the president, in addition to being aware of the hostility in New\nYork, was making a conscious effort to be “part of this great house.” (But, acknowledging\nthe difficulties inherent in his change of circumstances and of adapting to presidential\nlifestyle, she added, “How often will he go to Camp David?’—the Spartan, woodsy\npresidential retreat in Catoctin Mountain Park in Maryland—“How ’bout never.”’)\n\nAt the White House, he retreated to his own bedroom—the first time since the\nKennedy White House that a presidential couple had maintained separate rooms (although\nMelania was spending scant time so far in the White House). In the first days he ordered\ntwo television screens in addition to the one already there, and a lock on the door,\nprecipitating a brief standoff with the Secret Service, who insisted they have access to the\nroom. He reprimanded the housekeeping staff for picking up his shirt from the floor: “If\nmy shirt is on the floor, it’s because I want it on the floor.” Then he imposed a set of new\nrules: nobody touch anything, especially not his toothbrush. (He had a longtime fear of\nbeing poisoned, one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald’s—nobody knew he was\ncoming and the food was safely premade.) Also, he would let housekeeping know when\nhe wanted his sheets done, and he would strip his own bed.\n\nIf he was not having his six-thirty dinner with Steve Bannon, then, more to his liking,\nhe was in bed by that time with a cheeseburger, watching his three screens and making\nphone calls—the phone was his true contact point with the world—to a small group of\nfriends, among them most frequently Tom Barrack, who charted his rising and falling\nlevels of agitation through the evening and then compared notes with one another.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nBut after the rocky start, things started to look better—even, some argued, presidential.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 31, in an efficiently choreographed prime-time ceremony, an\nupbeat and confident President Trump announced the nomination of federal appellate\njudge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a perfect combination of\nimpeccable conservative standing, admirable probity, and gold-standard legal and judicial\ncredentials. The nomination not only delivered on Trump’s promise to the base and to the\nconservative establishment, but it was a choice that seemed perfectly presidential.\n\nGorsuch’s nomination was also a victory for a staff that had seen Trump, with this\nplum job and rich reward in his hand, waver again and again. Pleased by how the\nnomination was received, especially by how little fault the media could find with it,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019948",
