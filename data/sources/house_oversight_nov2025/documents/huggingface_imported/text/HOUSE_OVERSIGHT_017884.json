  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n819\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nhas been a party to lawsuits in the South-\nern District of New York, both as a plain-\ntiff and defendant. Fawcett Aff. 17. The\nMuslim World League Journal, a monthly\npublication distributed in American mos-\nques, ran solicitations from 1998 to 2001\nfor the Islamic Solidarity Fund & Waaf for\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference\nand the Khair Funds of the Muslim World\nLeague that provided NCB account num-\nbers to which donors could contribute di-\nrectly. Jd. 18, Ex. 5. Plaintiffs request\njurisdictional discovery to explore further\ncontacts.\n\nNCB argues that none of Plaintiffs’ sub-\nmissions satisfy the constitutionally re-\nquired showing of minimum contacts.\nNCB closed its New York City branch\noffice in 1992. Decl. of Jorge Juco (“Juco\nDecl.”) 15, at Berger Aff. in Support of\nNCB’s Motion to Dismiss Ashton and Bur-\nnett, Ex. 5. NCB’s second-tier subsidiary,\nSNCB Securities Inc., dissolved in Febru-\nary 2001. Jd. (citing Ex. A of Juco Decl.\nthe certified copy of the Certificate of Dis-\nsolution); see also Schenker v. Assicura-\nziont Generali, S.P.A, No. 98 Civ.\n9186(MBM), 2002 WL 1560788, at * 4\n(S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2002) (finding no per-\nsonal jurisdiction over parent corporation\nwhere New York subsidiary was sold two\nmonths prior to commencement of action).\nNCB submits its involvement in lawsuits is\nequally unavailing because both were ter-\nminated prior to the filing of this action.\nSee docket Logan Feed v. Nat'l Commer-\ncial Bank, No. 92 Civ. (S.D.N.Y.) (NCB\nterminated July 24, 1995); docket Nat’?\nCommercial Bank v. Morgan Stanley As-\nset Mgmt, Inc, No. 94 Civ. 3167\n(S.D.N.Y.) (closed Feb. 17, 1998). It con-\ntends that its consent to personal jurisdic-\ntion in one case does not open the door to\npersonal jurisdiction in future cases. See\nKlinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lawro, 937\nF.2d 44, 50 n. 5 @d Cir.1991); Andros\nCompania Manitima, S.A. v. Intertanker\n\nLtd., 714 F.Supp. 669, 675 (S.D.N.Y.1989)\n(holding lawsuits in the forum do not es-\ntablish general personal jurisdiction).\nNCB argues that there is no indication it\nplaced the advertisements in The Muslim\nWorld League Journal, or that any dona-\ntions were deposited into NCB accounts.\n\nIn arguing its absence of contacts with\nthe United States, NCB reiterates that it\nis not domiciled, organized, or maintaining\nan office in New York. Juco Decl. 13. It is\nnot registered or licensed to do business in\nthe United States and has no property in\nthe United States. Jd. 18. Shares of NCB\nstock are not sold in the United States,\nthere are no NCB employees or telephone\nnumbers in the United States, and the\ncompany does not advertise or solicit busi-\nness in the United States. 7d. 111. Its\nwebsite is accessible from United States,\nbut only NCB account holders may access\nthe inter-active services. /d. The Saudi\nArabian Monetary Agency requires that\nNCB’s account holders be Saudi citizens or\nresidents, Saudi government entities, or\nbusiness or charity entities with lawful sta-\ntus in Saudi Arabia. Juco Decl. 110.\n\nNCB claims the rare contacts it does\nhave with the United States do not satisfy\nthe requirements of due process. Al-\nthough it maintains correspondent banking\nrelationships with U.S. commercial banks,\nJuco Decl. 112, NCB argues such relation-\nships are insufficient to establish personal\njurisdiction over NCB. Semi Conductor\nMaterials, Inc. v. Citibank Intl PLC, 969\nF.Supp. 248, 244 (S.D.N-Y.1997) (holding\nforeign bank’s correspondent banking rela-\ntionship with New York bank is not suffi-\ncient for personal jurisdiction); Casio\nComputer Co. v. Sayo, No. 98 Civ.\n3772(WK), 2000 WL 1877516, at *26\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2000) (holding: defendant\nbank’s wire transfers to U.S. bank ac-\ncounts does not create minimum contacts);\nLeema Enters.
