Consequently, he had not yet been\nprovided with the passwords he needed to get the documents. Even\nif he had remained at the NSA long enough to finish his training,\nhe would only have been provided with the password to the particu-\nlar compartment relevant to his work, not to all compartments. The\ntight control over these passwords was, according to a former top\nNSA official, a critical part of the NSA’s security framework. He told\nme that Snowden, at least during the period of the thefts in April\nand May 2013, had no more legitimate access to the compartments\n\n© than the cleaning personnel.
