  "text": "13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights 255\n\nFor instance, there are Atom types referring to general natural language data types, such as\n\nWordNode\nSentenceNode\nWordInstanceNode\nDocumentNode\n\nplus more specific ones referring to relationships that are part of link-grammar parses of sen-\ntences\n\nFeatureNode\n\nFeatureLink\nLinkGrammarRelationshipNode\nLinkGrammarDisjunctNode\n\nor RelEx semantic interpretations of sentences\n\ne DefinedLinguisticConceptNode\ne DefinedLinguisticRelationshipNode\ne PrepositionalRelationshipNode\n\nThere are also Atom types corresponding to entities important for embodying OpenCog in\na virtual world, e.g.\n\nObjectNode\nAvatarNode\nHumanoidNode\nUnknownObjectNode\nAccessoryNode\n\n13.3.8 Truth Values and Attention Values\n\nCogPrime Atoms (Nodes and Links) are quantified with truth values that, in their simplest\nform, have two components, one representing probability (strength) and the other representing\nweight of evidence; and also with attention values that have two components, short-term and\nlong-term importance, representing the estimated value of the Atom on immediate and long-\nterm time-scales.\n\nIn practice many Atoms are labeled with CompositeTruthValues rather than elementary ones.\nA composite truth value contains many component truth values, representing truth values of\nthe Atom in different contexts and according to different estimators.\n\nIt is important to note that the CogPrime declarative knowledge representation is neither\na neural net nor a semantic net, though it does have some commonalities with each of these\ntraditional representations. It is not a neural net because it has no activation values, and involves\nno attempts at low-level brain modeling. However, attention values are very loosely analogous\nto time-averages of neural net activations. On the other hand, it is not a semantic net because\nof the broad scope of the Atoms in the network: for example, Atoms may represent percepts,\nprocedures, or parts of concepts. Most CogPrime Atoms have no corresponding English label.\nHowever, most CogPrime\n\nAtoms do have probabilistic truth values, allowing logical semantics.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013171",
