Any major\nslowdown or volatility across bond,\ncurrency and equity markets in China,\nincluding Hong Kong, would have major\nramifications for the rest of the world.\nWhile the US has limited direct\neconomic exposure to China—only 0.6%\nof exports as a share of GDP, 0.6%\nof bank assets and 0.7% of corporate\nprofits—any shocks in China will\nreverberate through US financial markets.\nAs shown earlier in Exhibit 18 on page\n19, US financial conditions tightened by\n118 basis points in the summer of 2015\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014564",
