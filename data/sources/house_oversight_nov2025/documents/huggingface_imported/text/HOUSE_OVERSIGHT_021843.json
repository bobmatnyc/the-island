The -- a school\nlike the University of Utah has, gosh, several hundred\nfaculty members, if not more, and so any time a member\nof the University of Utah speaks, they are giving their\nviews on the subject. There may be a range of views.\n\nSome Professors at the university of Utah may\nbe in favor of crime victim rights. Other Professors\nmay be opposed to crime victim rights. Young people\ngenerally jump to the conclusion that just because they\nare hearing a Professor from a particular school speak,\nthat that necessarily means that they are saying\nsomething that the university endorses.\n\nQ. If that's true, why do you include the\nfootnote on some pleadings?\n\nA. Well, I included the footnote in this\nparticular case, the dean at the law school said, hey,\nyou know, it might be useful just to drop a footnote in\njust to make sure that there's no misunderstanding and I\nsaid, sure, I would be glad to do that. And so I think\npleadings, in this case leading up to this, had the star\nfootnote. Apparently on the signature block had got\ndropped out. And then we were able to fix that ina\n\ncouple of days on this one.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021843",
