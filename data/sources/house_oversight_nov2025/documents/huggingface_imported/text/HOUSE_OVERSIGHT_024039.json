  "text": "these diseases further from what has historically been a death sentence into a chronic, treatable\ncondition. As this happens, huge markets will be created for entirely new biopharmaceutical\nproducts. While cancer is the leading disease area, this pace of dramatic scientific and\ntechnological progress is extending into several other areas of medicine and will likely\naccelerate. Many of the initial examples of targeted or personalized therapies in non-cancer\nindications have been in rare or so called \"orphan\" diseases following discovery of the\nunderlying genetic abnormalities. This period of rapid technology advancement establishes a\ncycle of innovation in the market that creates great opportunity for highly focused, small,\ncompanies.\n\nInformation Convergence:\n\nThe rate of innovation in information convergence has already accelerated relative to the\nhistorical rate of innovation in healthcare information technology (“HCIT”) due to several\nunderlying factors. First, as mentioned, the HITECH Act provided billions in direct incentives\nto encourage healthcare providers to adopt information technology, beginning with electronic\nmedical record (“EMR”) systems. This led to a significant increase in spending on EMRs which\nbenefitted large established EMR vendors, but it also benefitted new smaller players in the EMR\nmarket. Importantly, the broad upgrade of information technology and deployment of EMRs\nacross the healthcare provider market has established a technology infrastructure in the market\nthat benefits an entirely new generation of companies that are developing technologies that\nlayer onto existing EMRs and address the next levels of IT adoption. This next level of\ninformation technology adoption is dictated by the HITECH Act through a series of\n“meaningful use” incentive initiatives.\n\nAnother key factor that has led to an acceleration in innovation in information convergence is\nthat most of the highest value innovation in this sector is arising from integrating technologies\nthat have been discovered, developed, validated, and implemented in completely different\nsectors (e.g., cloud storage, mobile computing, wireless communications, web-delivered\nsoftware, diagnostics and sensors). These product development efforts draw heavily from\nexisting technologies and allow small companies focused on addressing discrete problems and\nopportunities within the healthcare market to develop and launch products with minimal\ntechnology discovery. The bulk of the effort in these activities is in rapidly creating high value\nproducts by combining well-understood and available technologies, and getting them into the\nhands of customers to evaluate their performance in real world use conditions. This early\ncustomer experience allows companies to generate revenues early in their life, but also provides\nvaluable user feedback which can be used to continuously improve product design elements.\nThe benefit of this type of product development effort in the information convergence sector is\nthat it reduces risk, lowers capital requirements, and results in more predictable timelines.\n\nConsidering the size of the opportunity and the large number of discrete problems and\ninefficiencies that must be addressed, the Fund Managers expect the next decade will be a\n\nperiod of robust innovation and company creation. Smaller companies are likely to thrive\nduring this period as they are better able to quickly move from opportunity to product launch.\n\n28 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024039",
