  "text": "304 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\npopular movement has emerged questioning its purpose and meth-\nods. As a result, a legitimate debate on what should constitute our\ndomestic liberties—and potential limits to those when facing sig-\nnificant security concerns—has largely obfuscated in this mind-set\nthe reality of Snowden’s weakening, durably and structurally, the\ncritical ability of the United States and its allies to address their\nmounting external security challenges. In this culture of distrust,\nwhatever contradicts the innocent whistle-blower narrative can be\npreemptively dismissed because Snowden, even though he remains\nensconced in Moscow at an unknown location, remains the ultimate\ntruth teller.\n\nI do not accept either this formulation of Snowden or his version\nof the events in which he was the hero. Opening a Pandora’s box of\ngovernment secrets is a dangerous undertaking. Whether Snowden’s\ntheft of state secrets proceeded from an idealistic attempt to right a\nwrong, a narcissistic drive to obtain personal recognition, an intent to\nweaken the foundations of the surveillance infrastructure in which\nhe worked, or a combination of such factors, by the time he arrived\n\n© in Moscow, it had evolved, deliberately or not, but necessarily, into ©\na mission of disclosing key national secrets to a foreign power. In\nthe end, such conjectures about Snowden’s motives matter less than\nthat he was helped, consciously or not, by others with interests that\ndiffered from those of the United States. The effects on America of\nsuch a massive breach of confidence might not easily be reversible.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 304 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019792",
