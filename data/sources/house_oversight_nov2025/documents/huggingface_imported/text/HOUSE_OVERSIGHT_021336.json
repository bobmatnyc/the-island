  "text": "both the self-perspective and the other-\nperspective were associated with\nactivation in the neural network involved\nin pain processing. These results reveal\nthe similarities in neural networks\nrepresenting first- and third-person\ninformation. In addition, however, the\nself-perspective yielded higher pain\nratings and involved more extensive\nactivation of some circuits in the pain\nmatrix than did the other-perspective,\nthus highlighting important differences\nbetween self- and other-perspectives.\n\nNeuroanatomical regions and\ncircuits form the foundation for the\nexperience of pain in others, but they are\nnot sufficient to explain variability in\ninterpersonal sensitivity. Although\nempathetic brain circuits are activated by\nthe mere perception of pain in others,\nactivity in these circuits can be\nmodulated by social, motivational, and\ncognitive factors. For example,\nobserving pain in likable others (1.e.,\nthose who played a game fairly) resulted\nin an enhancement of empathic brain\nresponses, whereas pain in dislikable\nothers who played unfairly did not.\nAnother functional MRI study (10)\nfound that participants showed\nsignificantly greater responses in neural\nregions that are involved in pain\nperception when observing the pain of\npeople who were not responsible for\ntheir stigmatized condition (i.e.,\nindividuals who contracted AIDS as the\nresult of a blood transfusion) than either\ncontrols (healthy individuals) or people\nwho were held responsible for their\ncondition (i.e., those who contracted\nAIDS through illegal drug use). In\naddition, participants expressed more\nempathy and personal distress in\nresponse to the pain of people who were\nnot responsible for their stigmatized\ncondition as compared to controls. The\n\nPage |90\n\nlevel of empathic response, therefore,\nseems to be influenced by motivational\nfactors as well as the interpersonal\nrelationship between the target and the\nobserver.\n\nAltogether, these findings\ndemonstrate that the similarities between\naffective representations of the self and\nthe other stem from shared neural\ncircuits that can be emulated either\nautomatically or intentionally by the act\nof perspective-taking. Importantly, these\nfindings also point to some distinctions\nbetween these two representations,\ndistinctions that contribute to our\ncapacity to detach ourselves from others\nsufficiently to make considered\nresponses to their pain.\n\nConclusion\n\nEmpathy, the natural capacity to\nshare, appreciate, and respond to the\naffective states of others, plays a crucial\nrole in much of human social interaction\nfrom birth to the end of life. As would be\nexpected if empathy functions to\nenhance social cohesion, social non-\nhuman primate species also exhibit\nrudimentary versions of empathy. What\nhumans have in abundance are higher-\nlevel cognitive and social abilities\n(language, theory of mind, executive\nfunctions) that can be deployed to\nmodulate empathic responses, and that\nare amenable to modulation by lower-\nlevel processes such as emotional\ncontagion and mimicry. These levels of\nprocessing enable empathy to have an\nimpact on a wide variety of human\nbehaviors. From motivating prosocial\nbehavior to providing the affective and\nmotivational bases for moral\ndevelopment, empathy is an invisible\nforce to reckon with when considering\nhow humans behave toward each other.\n\nReferences\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021336",
