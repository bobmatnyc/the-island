  "text": "DANNY HILLIS\n\nWilliam Daniel “Danny” Hillis (born September 25, 1956,\n\nin Baltimore, Maryland) is an American inventor, scientist,\nengineer, entrepreneur, and author. He co-founded Thinking\nMachines Corporation, a company that developed the\nConnection Machine, a parallel supercomputer designed\n\nby Hillis at MIT. He is also co-founder of the Long Now\nFoundation, Applied Minds, Metaweb Technologies,\n\nApplied Proteomics, and author of The Pattern on the\n\nStone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work.\n\nDanny Hillis was born in Baltimore, Maryland\nin 1956. His father, William Hillis, was a US Air Force\nepidemiologist studying hepatitis in Africa and relocated with\nhis family through Rwanda, Burundi, Republic of the Congo,\nand Kenya. He spent a brief part of his childhood in Calcutta,\nIndia when his father was a visiting faculty at ISI, Calcutta.\nDuring these years the young Hillis was home schooled by his\nmother Aryge Briggs Hillis, a biostatistician, and developed an\nearly appreciation for mathematics and biology. His younger\nbrother is David Hillis, a professor of evolutionary biology\nat the University of Texas at Austin, and his sister is Argye E.\nHillis, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn 1978 Hillis graduated from MIT with a BS degree\nin mathematics, followed in 1981 with an MS\ndegree in Electrical Engineering and Computer\nScience (EECS), specializing in robotics.\n\nDuring this time Hillis worked at the MIT Logo\nLaboratory developing computer hardware and software for\nchildren. He designed computer-oriented toys and games\nfor the Milton Bradley Company, and co-founded Terrapin\nSoftware—a producer of computer software for elementary\nschools. He also built a digital computer composed of\n\nTinkertoys that is on display at the Museum of Science, Boston.\n\nHillis’ major research, however, was into parallel\ncomputing. Hillis designed the Connection Machine, a\nparallel supercomputer; in 1983 Hillis co-founded Thinking\nMachines Corporation to produce and market supercomputers\nbased on this design. In 1988, continuing this research, Hillis\nreceived a PhD in EECS from MIT under doctoral advisers\nGerald Jay Sussman, Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon.\n\nHillis co-founded Thinking Machines Corporation in\n1983 while doing his doctoral work at MIT. The company was\nto develop Hillis’ Connection Machine design into commercial\nparallel supercomputers, and to explore computational\npathways to building artificial intelligence. Hillis’ ambitions\nare represented by the company’s motto: “We’re building\na machine that will be proud of us,” and Hillis’ parallel\narchitecture was to be the main component for this task:\n\nClearly, the organizing principle of the brain is\nparallelism. It’s using massive parallelism. The information\nis in the connection between a lot of very simple parallel\nunits working together. So if we built a computer that was\nmore along that system of organization, it would likely\nbe able to do the same kinds of things the brain does.\n\nAt Thinking Machines Corporation, Hillis\n\nbuilt a technical team with many people that would\n\nlater become leaders in science and industry including\nBrewster Kahle, Guy Steele, Sydney Brenner, David\nWaltz, Jack Schwartz, and Eric Lander. He even recruited\nRichard Feynman to spend his summers there. For many\nyears, Thinking Machines Corporation connection\nmachines were the fastest computers in the world.\n\nDuring 1994, however, Thinking Machines filed for\nbankruptcy. In 1996, after a short stint as a professor at the MIT\nMedia Lab, Hillis joined The Walt Disney Company full time\nin the newly created role of Disney Fellow and Vice President,\nResearch and Development, Walt Disney Imagineering,\nwhich Hillis claimed was an early ambition of his:\n\nI’ve wanted to work at Disney ever since I was a\nchild... remember listening to Walt Disney on television\ndescribing the ‘Imagineers’ who designed Disneyland.\n\nI decided then that someday I would be an Imagineer.\nLater, I became interested in a different kind of magic—\nthe magic of computers. Now I finally have the perfect\njob—bringing computer magic into Disney.\n\nAt Disney, Hillis developed new technologies as well\nas business strategies for Disney’s theme parks, television,\nmotion pictures, Internet and consumer products businesses.\nHe also designed new theme park rides, a full sized walking\nrobot dinosaur and various micro mechanical devices.\n\nHillis left Disney in 2000, taking with him Bran\nFerren, President of the Walt Disney Imagineering, R&D\nCreative Technologies division. Together, Ferren and Hillis\nfounded Applied Minds, a company aimed at providing\ntechnology and consulting services to firms in an array of\nindustries, including aerospace, electronics, and toys. In\nJuly 2005, Hillis and others from Applied Minds initiated\nMetaweb Technologies, Inc. to develop a semantic data storage\ninfrastructure for the Internet, and Freebase, an “open,\nshared database of the world’s knowledge”. When Metaweb\nwas acquired by Google, the technology became the basis\nof Google’s Knowledge Graph. Hillis, together with\nDr. David B. Agus, cofounded a spinoff of Applied Minds\ncalled Applied Proteomics Inc which designed and\nprototyped a machine that measures the level of proteins\nin the blood for medical diagnosis.\n\nHillis’ work with Agus on cancer led to the\nfounding of the University of Southern California\nPhysical Sciences-Oncology Center (USC PS-OC),\nfunded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Hillis\nis the principle investigator of this program.\n\nIn 1993, with Thinking Machines facing its demise,\nHillis wrote about long-term thinking and suggested a\nproject to build a clock designed to function for millennia:\n\nWhen I was a child, people used to talk about\nwhat would happen by the year 2000. Now, thirty years\nlater, they still talk about what will happen by the year\n\n2000. The future has been shrinking by one year per year\n\nfor my entire life. I think it is time for us to start a long-\nterm project that gets people thinking past the mental\nbarrier of the Millennium. I would like to propose a large\n(think Stonehenge) mechanical clock, powered by seasonal\ntemperature changes. It ticks once a year, bongs once a\ncentury, and the cuckoo comes out every millennium.\n\nThis clock became the Clock of the Long\nNow, a name invented by the songwriter and composer,\nBrian Eno. Hillis wrote an article for Wired magazine\nsuggesting a clock that would last over 10,000 years.\n\nThe project led directly to the founding of the Long Now\nFoundation in 1996 by Hillis and others, including Stewart\nBrand, Brian Eno, Esther Dyson, and Mitch Kapor.\n\nHillis asserts that parallelism itself is approximately\nthe main ingredient of intelligence; that there is not\nanything else required to make a mind result from a\ndistributed network of processors. Hillis believes that\n\n.. ntelligence is just a whole lot of little\nthings, thousands of them. And what will happen is\nwe Il learn about each one at a time, and as we doit,\nmachines will be more and more like people. It will\nbe a gradual process, and that’s been happening.\n\nThis is not so different from Marvin Minsky’s Society\nof Mind theory, which holds that mind is a collection of agents,\neach one taking care of a particular aspect of intelligence,\nand communicating with one another, exchanging\ninformation as required.\n\nSome artificial intelligence theorists have other\nopinions—that it’s not the underlying computational\nmode that’s crucial, but rather particular algorithms\n(of reasoning, memory, perception, etc.). Others\nargue that the right combination of “little things” is\nneeded to give rise to the overall emergent patterns of\ncoordinated activity that constitute real intelligence.\n\nHillis is one of a small number of people\nwho have made a serious attempt to create such a\n“thinking machine” and his ambitions are clear:\n\n“T’d like to find a way for consciousness to\ntranscend human flesh. Building a thinking machine is\nreally a search for a kind of Earthly immortality. Something\nmuch more intelligent than we can exist. Making a\nthinking machine is my way to reach out to that.”\n\nHillis’ 1998 popular science book The Pattern on the\nStone attempts to explain concepts from computer science for\nlaymen using simple language, metaphor and analogy. It moves\nfrom Boolean algebra through topics such as information\ntheory, parallel computing, cryptography, algorithms,\nheuristics, Turing machines, and promising technologies\nsuch as quantum computing and emergent systems.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017542",
