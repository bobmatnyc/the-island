Moreover, valuations now stand in their\n10th decile, indicating they have been cheaper\n\nat least 90% of the time historically. In the past,\nstarting from such a high base has led to muted\nequity returns over the subsequent five years, with\nonly a third of those episodes generating a profit\n(see Exhibit 47).\n\nEven so, high valuations should not be\nconfused with certainty of loss, especially over\nshort periods. As seen in Exhibit 48, today’s\nequity multiples tell us very little about potential\ngains over the next year, explaining only 5% of\ntheir variation historically. Moreover, history\nteaches us that a strategy of selling equities based\nsolely on expensive valuations has been a losing\napproach over time. As we noted in our 2014\nOutlook, research conducted by three professors\nat the London Business School concluded that\n\nInvestors have ridden this bull market\n\nfor eight years, and while we don’t\nexpect the ride to end in 2017, we\n\nmust stay vigilant to avoid the horns.\n\nunderweighting equities based exclusively on high\nvaluations underperformed a strategy of remaining\ninvested across every one of the 20 countries and\nthree country aggregates they examined.' In\nshort, valuations alone are a poor tactical timing\nsignal. Indeed, the S&P 500 has returned more\nthan 36% since first entering its 9th valuation\ndecile in November 2013, a time when many\n\nwere already suggesting that US equities were\n\nin a bubble.\n\nValuations must also be considered in\nthe context of the prevailing macroeconomic\nenvironment. Consider that periods of low and\nstable inflation, such as we expect for the year\nahead, have supported higher valuations in the past\n(see Exhibit 49). The same could be said for lower\ntaxes and deregulation—were they to materialize\nlater this year—as both would boost real returns\non invested capital and justify higher equity values.\nSimilarly, today’s structurally lower interest rates—\nreflecting slower population and productivity\ngrowth—reduce the rate at which\nall future cash flows are discounted,\nincreasing their present value.\n\nHere, it’s helpful to remember that the\nS&P 500’s long-term average P/E ratio—\nwhich many investors use to gauge\nfair value—was forged over a period\nwhen risk-free rates averaged 4.5%. In\ncontrast, the risk-free rate now is just\n0.5-0.75% and the Federal Reserve\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 51\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014584",
