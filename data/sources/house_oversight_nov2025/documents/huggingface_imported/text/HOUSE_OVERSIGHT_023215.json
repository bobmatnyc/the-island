Our\narrangement was for me to architect sophisticated structures that would be beneficial to you. that is what\nI have done and will continue do in order to fulfill my obligations under our agreement. The\ndiscovered fact that you in reality need an entire family office built from scratch has been trying I have\naleady agreed de- facto to try to help. I would suggest that Phaidons payroll and attention pales in\nimportance to your personal structure,which has taken a back seat, Some of = my suggestions regarding\nthe Eystum office are as follows you will need a budget of 3- 5 million per year. CEO 1 million, new\ntax person to work with rich, 250. new bookkeeper ,200 new paralegal to work with ADA ALan etc ,\ncoordinating with Apollo, Akin , paul weiss , new acct openings , sec filings , sales tax review, etc.\n$150. art point person. loan , inventory, purchasing support, $?? software servers. video conferencing,\ntax oversight.\n\nI believe You should rapidly address trustees , gift trust, succesion, wills of debra and children, ,\nmonetization events , cash flow. etc I can ofcourse share my experiences with you on each issue.\n\nWIth regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very\nstrong inclination is not to be involved at all . It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many\npitfall many that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the\nquality of the people involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the\nbegining of my involvement ) Iam also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -\ngiven all the complexities who else can do it? problem.\n\nYour family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking\nwith little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge\nEveryone would report to him. eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long\nshot my first choice as I prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work (ie\nthe word DONE will no longer be transmitted to reflect status stated by others )\n\nWith no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to\nthink through the problem creatively . My organizations handling of the more complex isssues I believe\nyou might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps\n,etc ) but would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat\nadministrator. not sure what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments.\nwhether Rich your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person.- is.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023215",
