  "text": "companion. They may be more capable\nof responding to God emotionally.\n\nAll theologies have trade-offs.\nThis one offers an intensely personal and\nperson-like God. He can comfort, like a\nfriend, and respond directly, like a\nfriend. He can be like a real social\nrelationship for those who make the\neffort to experience him in this way. But\nbecause that social relationship lacks so\nmany features of actual human\nsociality—no visible body, no\nresponsive face, no spoken voice—such\na theology demands a great deal of effort\nfrom those who follow it. They must\nconstantly work with their attention,\nreinterpreting the ordinary and natural\ninto the presence of the extra-ordinary\nand super-natural. Faiths which manage\nGod differently—less personal, more\npresent in the everyday natural world—\nmake fewer demands on their followers’\nattentional habits. But it may be,\nperhaps, that such a God may be easier\nto take for granted. Paradoxically, it may\nbe that this high-maintenance, effortful\nGod appeals to so many modern people\n(as many as a quarter of all Americans,\naccording to a recent Pew study)\nprecisely because the work demanded\nmakes the God feel more real in a world\nin which disbelief is such a real social\noption.\n\nReferences\n\n' Scholars who contribute to this\nperspective include Scott Atran, Justin\nBarrett, Pascal Boyer, Stewart Guthrie,\nand Harvey Whitehouse.\n\n* These churches have been described by\nMiller, D. 1997.
