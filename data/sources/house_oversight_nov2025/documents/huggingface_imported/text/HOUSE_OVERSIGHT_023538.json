They represent a violation\nof the organizational traditions followed by Hamas, and are not\nworthy of being issued against the leader or leadership of the Hamas\nmovement.\" He added that \"Dr. Zahar is not authorized to comment\non the statements made by the leader of the Hamas movement...the\npolitical bureau is the only institution that is authorized to issue any\nclarification or explanation on the statements issued by the\nleadership.\"\n\nDespite his strong statements, Izzat al-Rashaq denied that Zahar's\nstatements reflect a state of disagreement or division within Hamas,\nstressing that \"there is no disagreement within Hamas, the movement\nis highly united, and its decisions are one.\"\n\nSenior Hamas official Dr. Salah al-Bardawil confirmed to Asharq Al-\nAwsat that the Hamas movement is united, saying that some media\noutlets are trying to convince the public that there is division within\nthe ranks of Hamas. Al-Bardawil also stressed that Hamas figures\nhave the right to issue their statements using whatever language they\nwish so long as they are expressing their own views and ideas, and\nthis does not mean that there is a split in the Hamas movement's\ndecision.\n\nDr. Bardawil also stressed to Asharg Al-Awsat that Hamas is under\nthe leadership of Khalid Meshal, adding that Hamas is a resistance\nmovement that believes that resistance is the means of liberating\nPalestine, especially after it has became clear to everybody that \"it\nwould be a terrible gamble to bet on these futile negotiations.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023538",
