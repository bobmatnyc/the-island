  "text": "Since her firing on January 30, Yates had remained suspiciously quiet. When\njournalists approached her, she, or her intermediaries, explained that per her lawyers she\nwas shut down on all media. The president believed she was merely lying in wait. In\nphone calls to friends, he worried about her “plan” and “strategy,” and he continued to\npress his after-dinner sources for what they thought she and Ben Rhodes, Trump’s favorite\nObama plotter, had “up their sleeves.”\n\nFor each of his enemies—and, actually, for each of his friends—the issue for him came\ndown, in many ways, to their personal press plan. The media was the battlefield. Trump\nassumed everybody wanted his or her fifteen minutes and that everybody had a press\nstrategy for when they got them. If you couldn’t get press directly for yourself, you\nbecame a leaker. There was no happenstance news, in Trump’s view. All news was\nmanipulated and designed, planned and planted. All news was to some extent fake—he\nunderstood that very well, because he himself had faked it so many times in his career.\nThis was why he had so naturally cottoned to the “fake news” label. “ve made stuff up\nforever, and they always print it,” he bragged.\n\nThe return of Sally Yates, with her appointment before the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee, marked the beginning, Trump believed, of a sustained and well-organized\nmedia rollout for her. (His press view was confirmed later in May by a lavish,\nhagiographic profile of Yates in the New Yorker. “How long do you think she was\nplanning this?” he asked, rhetorically. “You know she was. It’s her payday.”) “Yates is\nonly famous because of me,” the president complained bitterly. “Otherwise, who is she?\nNobody.”\n\nIn front of Congress that Monday morning, Yates delivered a cinematic performance—\ncool, temperate, detailed, selfless—compounding Trump’s fury and agitation.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nOn the morning of Tuesday, May 9, with the president still fixated on Comey, and with\nKushner and his daughter behind him, Priebus again moved to delay: “There’s a right way\nto do this and a wrong way to do this,” he told the president. “We don’t want him learning\nabout this on television. I’m going to say this one last time: this is not the right way to do\nthis. If you want to do this, the right way is to have him in and have a conversation. This is\nthe decent way and the professional way.” Once more, the president seemed to calm down\nand become more focused on the necessary process.\n\nBut that was a false flag. In fact, the president, in order to avoid embracing\nconventional process—or, for that matter, any real sense of cause and effect—merely\neliminated everybody else from his process. For most of the day, almost no one would\nknow that he had decided to take matters into his own hands. In presidential annals, the\nfiring of FBI director James Comey may be the most consequential move ever made by a\nmodern president acting entirely on his own.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020046",
