  "text": "822\n\nthe Global Diamond Resource’s Chairman\nby an executive of SBG. Ashton Complaint\n1459; Burnett Complaint { 328.\n\nPlaintiffs claim that SBG had an address\nin Rockville, Maryland until very recently.\nAshton Complaint 1545; Burnett Com-\nplaint 1318. SBG claims the Rockville\naddress was the headquarters of a sepa-\nrately incorporated company, SBG USA,\nwhich was formally dissolved in December\n1999. See SBG Memorandum in Support\nof Motion to Dismiss Ashton Complaint at\n7 & Ex. 2 (articles of dissolution); see also\nKlinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lawro, 937\nF.2d 44, 52 (2d Cir.1991) (personal juris-\ndiction contacts determined at time com-\nplaint is filed); but see Metro. Life, 84\nF.3d at 569 (holding courts should examine\na defendant’s contacts with the forum for a\nreasonable period prior to year of lawsuit\nand finding six years was reasonable).\n\n[67] The Burnett complaint does not\ncontain any factual allegations against Tar-\niq, Omar, or Bakr Binladin from which the\nCourt could infer that they purposefully\ndirected their activities at the United\nStates, that they were members of a con-\nspiracy pursuant to the New York long-\narm statute, or that they have any general\nbusiness contacts with the United States.\nAccordingly, the Burnett complaint against\nthese three individuals is dismissed.\n\n[68] Rather than permitting a 12(e)\nstatement, the Court finds jurisdictional\ndiscovery is warranted to determine if\nSBG purposefully directed its activities at\nthe United States. See Asp v. Nrelsen\nMedia Research, No. 03 Civ. 5866(SAS),\n2004 WL 315269, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18,\n2004) (noting the purpose of Rule 12(e) is\nto “strike at unintelligibility rather than\nwant of detail and ... allegations that are\nunclear due to lack of specificity are more\nappropriately clarified by discovery”).\nSpecifically, although the complaints are\nnot specific about when, at the very least,\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nSBG provided construction support to Osa-\nma bin Laden. Ashton Complaint 19 550,\n552-53; Burnett Complaint 11319-22. A\nbranch of SBG allegedly look in an al\nQaeda operative who listed the SBG\nbranch address on his visa application.\nAshton Complaint 1555; Burnett Com-\nplaint 1324. It is alleged to have ties to\nU.S.-designated terrorist Yassin Abdullah\nAl-Kadi. Ashton Complaint 1459; Bur-\nnett Complaint 1328. At this stage, the\nCourt must accept as true Plaintiffs’ con-\ntentions that SBG still contains Osama bin\nLaden’s name in its corporate documents.\nAshton Complaint 1558; Burnett Com-\nplaint 1329. Additionally, although it\nwould not satisfy the due process requi-\nsites on its own, SBG’s presence in Mary-\nland three years before the complaints\nwere filed, also warrants some discovery.\nAccordingly, SBG’s motion to dismiss the\nAshton and Burnett complaints are denied\nwithout prejudice.\n\n9. SAAR Network\n\nThe Federal Plaintiffs claim the SAAR\nNetwork is a network of “interrelated os-\ntensible charities” that was established in\nthe 1980s “to generate and surreptitiously\ntransfer funds to terrorist organizations,\nincluding al-Qaeda.” Federal Complaint\n1222. Several organizations within the\nSAAR Network, including SAAR Founda-\ntion, SAAR International, Safa Group,\nMar—Jac Poultry, Mar—Jac Holdings, Inc.,\nSafa Trust, Inc. and Aradi, Inc., were es-\ntablished, funded or closely affiliated with\nDefendant Suleiman Abdul Aziz al Rajhi.\nId. at. 1223. By September 11, 2001, there\nwere allegedly over one hundred entities in\nthis network, “including the U.S. branches\nof MWL, IIRO and WAMY, [and the\nSAAR Network Defendants moving to dis-\nmiss here,] African Muslim Agency, Grove\nCorporate, Inc., Heritage Education Trust,\nInternational Institute of Islamic Thought,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017887",
