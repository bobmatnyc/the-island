  "text": "100\n\nSnowden also performed his security procedures on camera, including stuffing bed pillows\nunder the door to block any eaves-droppers, throwing a red blanket over his head, which he called\njokingly his “magical cloak of power.” He explained to Greenwald that his donned his “cloak”\nwhen he turned on his laptop to prevent any hidden cameras in the room from spotting his\npassword. He also checked the hotel phone for bugs. It was not without irony that he went\nthrough these security rituals to protect his data as he allowed Poitras to film NSA data on his\ncomputer screen. Since he planned to use these journalists as his outlets to go public in a few\ndays, the security measures he did while on camera would only serve a temporary purpose.\n\nThe centerpiece of the planned video would take the form of an interview with Greenwald.\nSnowden himself provided the talking points. The filming would eventually provide Poitras with\na feature-length movie, CitizenFour, which would be commercially released in October 2014 and\nwin an Academy Award for her.\n\nThe next day, Wednesday June 4\", Ewen MacAskill, the Guardian editor, joined Poitras\nand Greenwald in Snowden’s room. Snowden insisted that he also go through the ritual of\nstowing his cell phone in the mini-bar refrigerator. Not without irony, Snowden’s own phone can\nbe seen on his bed recharging. Although MacAskill was sent by Gibson to the event to verify the\nsource’s bona fides, he apparently had not been well briefed. The questioning went as follows:\n\nMacAskill: Sorry, I don’t know anything about you.\nSnowden: OK, I work for—\n\nMacAskill: Sorry, I don’t know even your name.\n\nSnowden: Oh, sorry, my name is Edward Snowden. I go by Ed\n\nMacAskill went on to ask him to enumerate the various positions he held during his career in\nintelligence. Snowden was not entirely truthful in describing himself. He said that he had been a\nsenior adviser to the CIA, when he had been just a telecommunications support officer in the CIA.\nHe also said he had been a senior adviser at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) even though,\naccording to that intelligence service, he was not actually ever employed there. (He merely spoke\nat an interagency counterintelligence course the DIA had sponsored.) He said he had a $200,000\na year salary from Booz Allen when, according to Booz Allen, it was $133,000. It is\nunderstandable that he wanted to impress these Guardian journalists in light of his young age and\nboyish appearance, even to the extent of meretriciously claiming in the video that he personally\nhad been given the “authority” at the NSA to intercept President Obama’s private\ncommunications, which, according to a NSA spokeswoman, was not true. No NSA employee,\nand certainly not a civilian contract worker, was given the authority to soy on the President of the\nUnited States, she insisted. Such career enhancements suggest that Snowden altered factual\nreality when it suits his purpose with journalists.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020252",
