I tell you \nthis so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire. \nA story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly, and when to fly, he couldnt \nhelp himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates. Donald and I \ntried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting at little \nnells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on board,- Trump \nlooked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to us.- a metaphor for \nyour office. . . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month window and tens of \nunasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have saved way more than \nyou often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but i reallize you are stressed. \nBarry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's , structures. cash flow, financial statments \netc. I will present barry my thoughts on the overall redo , it will be the exact same email that i presented to \nyou and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming report stil \nfunky). IT etc I pointed out some of the more glaring errors to barry to give him a flavor of what is to come. \nTuesday if you like we should discuss Giacometti , and pesner . difficult to finesse him if they are \nfiling documents that you won't. these ridiculous conversations with tons of people on the phone , removes \nany claim you might have to not be considered a WILLFUL NON-FILER. ( after youve been told by attnys \nand pwc that you should file in writing , you have NO choice ) .. worst possible result - including \nserious penalties up the kazoo. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
