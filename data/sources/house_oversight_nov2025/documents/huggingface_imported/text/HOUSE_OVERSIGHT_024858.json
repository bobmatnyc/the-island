We\nwould highlight that on a price per mg basis, beverages skew higher across the board,\n\nrelative to tinctures, capsules and gummies.\n\nFigure 70 Beverage Price Points Are Premium Relative To Tinctures, Capsules, Gummies, And Topicals\n\nOOCOREF\nONUNON\nOududM\n\n$110 e109 §1.00\n\nCBD Living\nRoot Origins\n\nSuper Premium\n\n(> $0.83)\n\nCBD Beverages by Price Segment\n\n$0.80\n\n90.63 6953 §053 $0.50 $0.50 $046 $0.42 ¢0.40 $0.35 $034\n\nAurora Elixers\nEndo Brands\nMountjoy\nDiamond CBD\nKickback\nCanmnabinoid\nCreations\n\nMain\n($0.29-50.56)\n\nEVERx Nutrition\n\n$025 $021 $020 $0.16 0,12\n\nHemp Bombs\nRocky Mountain\n\nSource: Company Websites and Cowen and Company\nNote: Reflects price per mg of CBD; For companies with multiple SKUs, we used a straight line average\n\nBased on our survey, of respondents that use CBD, 19.2% use beverages as a form\nfactor, which is admittedly higher than we would’ve expected given the nascent stage of\nthe category. Similar to both capsules and topicals, beverage use is a more popular\nchoice among younger, lower income consumers (by a wider margin relative to other\nage cohorts compared to the other categories). This leaves us optimistic on the future\nprospects of the category as a waterfall effect can result in an increase in category mix.\n\nFigure 71 Popularity Among Younger Consumers Can Result In A Waterfall Effect Over Time\n\n35.0%\n30.0%\n25.0%\n20.0%\n15.0%\n10.0%\n\n5.0%\n\n0.0%\n\nCBD Beverage Use\n28.8%\n\nMale Female <S50K\n\nGender\n\n$50K-$100K >$100K\n\nIncome\n\nSource: Cowen Survey, n=~2500, January 2019\n\n42\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024858",
