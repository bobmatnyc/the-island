  "text": "given Egypt’s much-savored relationship with other Gulf countries (not to mention the United States). It does\nrepresent a re-balancing of relationships in a changing Middle East nonetheless.\n\nA new round of talks between Iran and the P5+1 (five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany)\nhas now been scheduled to take place on February 26\" following weeks of conflicting reports and what seemed\nto be a diplomatic stalemate. This represents the first effort at talks at the political directors’ level since the\nMoscow meeting in June of 2012. While the talks are restarting just over a month after the start of US President\nObama’s second term, Iran appears to have moved into its political season: tensions between President\nAhmadinejad and the speaker of the Majlis, Larjani, have gone public with mutual recriminations about corrupt\nfamily members and associates.\n\nSaudi Arabia: Former intelligence chief Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz was appointed second deputy prime minister of Saudi\nArabia on February 2\", a role traditionally associated with the incumbent being second in line to become king. Prince\nMuarin is the youngest son of the kingdom’s founder.\n\nYemen: A UN Security Council delegation visited Yemen on January 27\" in a show of support to President Hadi\nand Yemen’s political transition. The visit reflects the Security Council’s interest in seeing Yemen move forward\nwith the National Dialogue Conference. During the visit there were large demonstrations, as thousands demanded\na fair and just approach in dealing with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has received immunity under\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council initiative.\n\nDe ee ee ee ee ee ee ee i ee a\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
