  "text": "an artistic way if he wants to communicate his research. He obviously wants to\ncommunicate and talk to others. A scientist invents new objects, and the\nquestion is how to describe them. In all of these aspects, science is not very\ndifferent from art.\n\nWhen I asked him how he defined cybernetics, von Foerster answered:\n\nThe substance of what we have learned from cybemetics is to think in circles: A\nleads B, B to C, but C can return to A. Such kinds of arguments are not linear but\ncircular. The significant contribution of cybernetics to our thinking is to accept\ncircular arguments. This means that we have to look at circular processes and\nunderstand under which circumstances an equilibrium, and thus a stable\nstructure, emerges.\n\nToday, where AI algorithms are applied in daily tasks, one can ask how the\nhuman factor is included in these kinds of processes and what role creativity and art\ncould play in relation to them. There are thus different levels to think about when\nexploring the relation between AI and art.\n\nSo, what do contemporary artists have to say about artificial intelligence?\n\nArtificial Stupidity\n\nHito Steyerl, an artist who works with documentary and experimental film, considers two\nkey aspects that we should keep in mind when reflecting on the implications of AI for\nsociety. First, the expectations for so-called artificial intelligence, she says, are often\noverrated, and the noun “intelligence” is misleading; to counter that, she uses the term\n“artificial stupidity.” Second, she points out that programmers are now making invisible\nsoftware algorithms visible through images, but to understand and interpret these images\nbetter, we should apply the expertise of artists.\n\nSteyerl has worked with computer technology for many years, and her recent\nartworks have explored surveillance techniques, robots, and such computer games as in\nHow Not to Be Seen (2013), on digital-image technologies, or HellYeahWeFuckDie\n(2017), about the training of robots in the still-difficult task of keeping balance. But to\nexplain her notion of artificial stupidity, Steyerl refers to a more general phenomenon,\nlike the now widespread use of Twitter bots, noting in our conversation:\n\nIt was and still is a very popular tool in elections to deploy Twitter armies to\nsway public opinion and deflect popular hashtags and so on. This is an artificial\nintelligence of a very, very low grade. It’s two or maybe three lines of script.\nIt’s nothing very sophisticated at all. Yet the social implications of this kind of\nartificial stupidity, as I call it, are already monumental in global politics.\n\nAs has been widely noted, this kind of technology was seen in the many\nautomated Twitter posts before the 2016 U.S. presidential election and also shortly before\nthe Brexit vote. If even low-grade AI technology like these bots are already influencing\nour politics, this raises another urgent question: “How powerful will far more advanced\ntechniques be in the future?”\n\n145\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016948",
