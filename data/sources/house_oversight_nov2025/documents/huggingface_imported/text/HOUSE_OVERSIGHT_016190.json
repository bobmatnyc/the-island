  "text": "assume a terminal growth rate of 2% across all of the markets, starting from 2023. For\nSTC's associates, we value its holdings in Oger Telecom and Binariang using a\ncombination of our Research team's valuation (for Oger's stake in Turk Telecom) and\nbook value. We then add STC's net cash position at YE 2015 in deriving our PO.\n\nRisks to our PO come from potential market share loss as both Mobily and Zain KSA,\nplus several MVNO's are aiming to take market share from STC domestically, following\nrecent cut in MTR's. Additionally, we see ongoing risk from FX exposure at their\nsubsidiary investments, especially their indirect stake in Turk Telekom.\n\nSavola (XSAVF)\nGiven the diversified nature of the Savola group, we use a sum of the parts valuation in\nderiving our SAR46/share price objective for Savola. Specifically, we:\n\nValue the food business on 12x 2016 earnings, a 30% discount to global peers on\naccount have having slightly slower growth and risks presented by having a significant\nposition in Iran (which accounts for 13% of revenues).\n\nValue retail(Panda) at 15x 2016 earnings, a c.10% discount to global peers on account of\nhaving slower near term growth. we believe near term growth will be impacted by\ncontinued aggressive expansion and slowing demand trends in the Saudi market\n(following the introduction of the 2016 budget).\n\nThe investments business is valued using a variety of methods. For its stake in Almarai,\nwe value it in line with our price objective for the shares. Savola's interests in other\nlisted entities (Herfy, KEC and EEC) are valued at current market valuation given we do\nnot have research coverage on the names. The stakes in none listed entities including\nthe real estate book and private equity holdings are valued at 2x book value (YE2015).\n\nDownside risks to our PO include higher cost escalation than we forecast, further\nadverse moves in commodity prices , adverse FX movements in countries outside of\nSaudi Arabia where Savola does business and any disruptions to its material Iranian\nbusiness.\n\nTHALES (THLEF)\n\nTo derive our Thales price objective of €87, we use a 2017E sum of the parts valuation,\nusing Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Ultra, and the EU Civil Aerospace\npeer group as peers for the Aerospace/defence segments, and Ansaldo STAS as a peer\n\nfor the transport business.\n\nAt €87 Thales would trade on 18.1x 2017E P/E and 12.3x EV/EBITA which we think is\nappropriate given balance sheet/ portfolio optionality and building order momentum.\n\nUpside/Downside risks to our price objective are: 1) changes in the company's free float,\n2) assets swap and portfolio changes could add more value than we currently estimate\n3) lower/more French defence cuts than we currently estimate.\n\nYANSAB (XUYNF)\nWe apply a justified P/E multiple to derive YANSAB's PO of SAR48. The P/E is based on\na normalized RoE of 14.5%, Cost of Equity of 11% and payout of 70%\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1. Lower-than-expected demand for polyester\nwould adversely impact MEG prices and effectively earnings 2. Unexpected change in\nfeedstock prices could negatively impact earnings 3. Unexpected shutdowns that would\nresult in lower production.\n\n80 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016190",
