We have\nseen a sharp increase in the last couple\nof years in what are deemed to be\nmajor economically significant rules.\nThat is defined as regulations that impose\na cost on the economy of $100 million\nor more.\nAccording to the administration's Office\nof Management and Budget, the\ncurrent administration has been regu-\nIating at a pace of 84 major rules per\nyear. By way of comparison, that is\nabout a 50-percent increase over the\nregulatory output during the Clinton\nadministration, which had about 56\nrules per year, and an increase from\nthe Bush administration as well. So we\nhave seen more regulations and more\nsignificant regulations.\nI was encouraged to hear President\nObama's words when he talked about\nthe Executive order in January, which\nis entitled \"Improving Regulation and\nRegulatory Review.\" But now we need\nto see action. We need to see it from\nthe administration, from individual\nagencies to provide real regulatory relief\nfor job creators to be able to reduce\nthis drag on the economy.\nOne commonsense step we can take is\nto strengthen what is called the Unfunded\nMandates Relief Act. It was\npassed in 1995. It was bipartisan. I was\na cosponsor in the House of Representatives.\nIt is an effort to require Federal\nregulators to evaluate the cost of rules,\nto look at the benefits and the costs,\nand to look at less costly alternatives\non rules.\nThe two amendments I would like to\noffer over the next few days as we consider\nthe legislation before us would\nimprove this Unfunded Mandates Reform\nAct, and it would reform it in\nways that are entirely consistent with\nthe principle President Obama has laid\nout and committed to in his Executive\norder on regulatory review.\nThe first amendment would require\nagencies specifically to assess potential\neffects of new regulations on job\ncreation-so focusing in on jobs-and\nto consider market-based and nongovernmental\nalternatives to regulation.\nThis would broaden the scope of\nthe Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to\nrequire cost-benefit analysis of rules\nthat impose direct or indirect costs of\n$100 miilion a year or more. So, again,\nthis is for major rules of $100 million or\nmore. It would also require agencies to\nadopt the least costly or least burdensome\noption that achieves whatever\npolicy goals have been set out by Congress.\nIt seems to me it is a commonsense\namendment. I hope we will get\nbipartisan support for it.\nThe second amendment would extend\nthe Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to\nso-called independent agencies which\ntoday are actually exempt from the\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD\n- SENATE\ncost-benefit rules that govern aII other\nagencies. In 1995, we had this debate\nand determined at that time we would\nnot extend the legislation to independent\nagencies. In the interim, independent\nagencies have been providing\nmore and more rules, have put out\nmore and more regulations, and are\nhaving a bigger and bigger impact. An\nexample of an independent agency\nwould be the SEC, the Securities and\nExchange Commission, or the CFTC,\nwhich is the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission. These are agencies\nthat, although independent in the executive\nbranch, are very much involved\nin putting out major rules and regulations.\nIt is sometimes called the \"headless\nfourth branch\" of government because\ntheir rules are not reviewed for\ncost-benefit analysis, even by the OMB,\nthe Office of Management and Budget,\nin its Office of Information and Regulatory\nAffairs, so-called OIRA.\nWe have looked at some GAO data\nand put together various studies, and it\nappears to us that there are about 200\nregulations that were issued between\n1996 until today that would be deemed\nto have an impact of $100 million or\nmore on the economy but were automatically\nexcluded from the Unfunded\nMandates Relief Act because they were\ndeemed to be from independent agencies.\nSo it is basically closing a loophole\nand closing this independent agency\nloophole, which I believe is a sensible\nreform. It has been endorsed by many\npeople, including, interestingly, the\ncument OIRA Administrator and the\nPresident's regulatory czat, Cass\nSunstein, who, in a2002 Law Review article,\ntalked about the fact that this is\nan area where UMRA ought to be extended\nbecause, again, there were so\nmany independent agencies that were\nputting out regulations impacting job\ncreation in this country.\nNo regulation, whatever its source,\nshould be imposed on American employers\nor on State and local governments\nwithout serious consideration of\nthe costs, the benefits, and the availability\nof a least-burdensome alternative.\nBoth these amendments would\nmove us further toward that sensible\ngoal, and I hope the leadership will\nallow these amendments to be offered.\nI think they fit well with the underlying\nlegislation. If they are offered, I\ncertainly urge my colleagues on both\nsides of the aisle to support them.\nI yield the floor. I suggest the absence\nof a quorum.\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The\nclerk will call.\nThe bill clerk proceeded to caII the\nroII.\nMr. DURBIN. Mr. President. I ask\nunanimous consent that the order for\nthe quorum call be rescinded.\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without\nobjection, it is so ordered.\nMORNING BUSINESS\nMr. DURBIN. Mr. president. I ask\nunanimous consent that Senators be\ns3607\nallowed to speak as i.n morning business\nfor up to 10 minutes each.\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without\nobjection, it is so ordered.\nTRIBUTE TO LOUIS E. GIVAN\nMr. MoCONNELL. Mr. President, I\nrise today to recognize a distinguished\nKentuckian who has worked tirelessly\non behalf of our Nation's soldiers, sailors\nand marines for more than 40 years.\nLouis E. Givan, a lifelong resident of\nmy hometown of Louisville, has played\na vital role in protecting the men and\nwomen of our Armed Forces and our\ncountry's defense.\nFormerly a sailor himself in the U.S.\nNavy, he has served for the last 11\nyears as the general manager of\nRaytheon Missile Systems operations\nin Louisville. I was saddened to hear of\nhis retirement from that position this\ncoming July 5. He will certainly be\nmissed.\nMr. Givan-or, to those who know\nhim, Ed-was a 1966 graduate of St. Xavier\nHigh Schooi in Louisville and in\n1970 earned his bachelor of science degree\nin mechanical engineering from\nthe J.B. Speed School of Engineering\nat the University of Louisville. In 1968,\nhe began working at the Naval Ordnance\nStation in Louisville, and he\nstayed at that post until 1996, in various\nengineering and supervisory positions.\nIn 1996 the Naval Ordnance Station\ntransitioned to private ownership, and\nEd's leadership was crucial in making\nthat transition a successful one. The\nfacility eventually became part of\nRaytheon Missile Systems, and Ed was\nappointed general manager in 2000. As\ngeneral manager, Ed has led Raytheon\nMissile Systems in Louisville to great\nsuccess, success for both the company\nand for the local community. They design,\ndevelop, and produce vital weapons\nsystems for our armed forces, enabling\nAmerica to have the most formidable\nmilitary force in the world.\nWeapons produced at the Louisville facility\nare used by our forces in all parts\nof the globe, including in Iraq.\nKentucky is lucky to have benefitted\nfrom Ed's dedication, commitment to\nexcellence, and leadership for so many\nyears. I am sure his wife Velma; his\nsons Eddie, Tony, and Chris; and his\ngrandchildren Benjamin, Nathan,\nIsaac, Macy and Natalie are all very\nproud of what Ed has accomplished. I\nwish him the very best in retirement,\nand I am sure my colleagues join me in\nsaying that this U.S. Senate thanks\nMr. Louis E. \"Ed\" Givan for his faithful\nservice.\nCRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT\nMr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous\nconsent that the following letter\nbe printed in the Rncono.\nThere being no objection, the material\nwas ordered to be printed in the\nRncono. as follows:\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 85-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2011 Page 3 of 4\ns3608\nU.S. Ssllero,\nWashington, DC, June 6, 2011.\nHon. ERIC H. HOLDER. Jr..\nAttmneA General\\ U.S. Department of Justice,\nWashington, DC.\nDEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL HoLDER: I am\nwriting about the Justice Department's implementation\nof the Crime Victims' Rishts\nAcb-an act that I co-sponsored in 2004.\nThese questions relate to an Office of Legal\nCounsel (\"OLC'1) Opinion made public on\nMay 20, 2011 and more broadly to concerns I\nhave heard from crime victims' advocates\nthat the Department has been thwarting effective\nimplementation of the Act by failing\nto extend the Act to the investigative phases\nof criminal cases and by preventing effective\nappellate enforcement of victims' rights. I\nam writing to ask you to answer these questions\nand explain the Department's actions\nin these areas.\nGOVERNMENT PROTECTION OF VICTIMS' RIGIITS\nDURING INVESTIGATION OF A CRIME\nWhen Congress enacted the CVRA, it intended\nto protect crime victims throughout\nthe criminal justice process-from the investigative\nphases to the final conclusion of a\ncase. Congress could not have been clearer in\nits direction that using \"best efforts\" to enforce\nthe CVRA was an obligation of\n\"[o]fficers and employees of the Department\nof Justice and other departments and agencies\nof the United States engaged in the detection,\ninaestigd,tion, or prosecution of crime\n. . . .\" 18 U.S.C. 93771(c)(1) (emphasis added).\nCongress also permitted crime victims to assert\ntheir rights either in the court in which\nformal charges had already been filed ,,or, if\nno prosecution is underwag, in the district\ncourt in the district in which the crime occurred.\"\n18 U.S.C. gBZTI(dXB) (emphasis\nadded).\nDespite Congress'clear intention to extend.\nrights to crime victims throughout the process,\nthe Justice Department is read.ing the\nCVRA much more narrowly. In the recent\nOLC opinion, for example, the Department\ntakes the position that ,,the CVRA is best\nread as providing that the rights identified\nin section 3771(a) are guaranteed. from the\ntime that criminal proceed.ings are initiated\n(by complaint, information, or indictmenr)\nand cease to be available if all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits\n(or if the Government declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).',\nThe Availability of Crime Victims, Rights\nUnder the Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004,\nMemorandum from John E. Bies (Dec. 12,\n2010, publicly released May 20,2011) (hereinafter\n\"OLC Opinion\"). Indeed, in that same\nopinion, I am surprised to see the Depart_\nment citing a snippet from my floor remarks\nduring the passage of the CVRA for the prop_\nosition that crime victims can confer with\nprosecutors only after the formal filing of\ncharges. See id. at 9 (citing 1b0 Cong. Rec.\n54260, 54268 (Apr. 22,2004) (statement of Sen.\nKyl).\nI did want to express my surprise that your\nprosecutors are so clearly quoting my re_\nmarks out of context. Here is the full pas_\nsage of my remarks, which were part of a\ncolloquy with my co-sponsor on the CVRA.\nSenator Feinstein:\nSenator Feinstein: Section . . . (a)(b) pro_\nvides a right to confer with the attorney for\nthe Government in the case. This right is in_\ntended to be erpansiue. For example, the vic_\ntim has the right to confer with the Govern_\nment concerning any critical stage or dis_\nposition of the case. The right, howeuer. is not\nlimited to these eramples. I ask the Senator if\nhe concurs in this intent.\nSenator Kyl: Yes. The intent of this sec_\ntion is just as the Senator says. This risht to\nconfer does not give the crime victim any\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE June 8,2011\nright to\n-\ndirect the prosecution. Prosecutors right to fair treatment and their right to\nshould consider it part of their profession to confer with prosecutors when the Justice Debe\navailable to consult with crime victims partment is negotiating pre-indictment plea\nabout concerns the victims may have which agreements and non-prosecution agreements\nare pertinent to the case, case proceedings or with defense attorneys, including negotiadispositions.\nUnder this provision, uictims are tions within the Fifth Circuit?\nable to confer with the Gouernment's attorneA\nabout proceedings after charging.\n150 Cong. Rec. 54260, 54268 (Apr. 22, 2004)\n(statements of Sens. Feinstein & Kyl) (emphases\nadded). Read in context, it is obvious\nthat the main point of my remarks was that\na victim's right to confer was \"intended to\nbe expansive.\" Senator Feinstein and I then\ngave various examples of situations in which\nvictims could confer with prosecutors, with\nthe note that the right to confer was \"not\nlimited to these examples.\" It is therefore\ntroubling to me that in this opinion the Justice\nDepartment is quoting only a limited\nportion of my remarks and wrenching them\nout of context to suggest that I think that\ncrime victims do not have any right to confer\n(or to be treated with fairness) until after\ncharging.\nIn giving an example that the victims\nwould have such rights after charging, I was\nnot suggesting that they had no such right\nearlier in the process. Elsewhere in my remarks\nI made clear that crime victims had\nrights under the CVRA even before an ind.ictment\nis filed. F or example, in the passage\nquoted above, I made clear that crime victims\nhad a right to consult about both ,,the\ncase\" and \"case proceedingg',-i.g., both\nabout how the case was being handled before\nbeing filed in court and. then later how the\ncase was being handled in court ,,proceedings.\"\nAs another example, Senator\nFeinstein and I explained that we had drafted\nthe CVRA to extend a right to victims to\nattend only \"public\" proceedings, because\notherwise the rights would extend. to grand\njury proceedings. See, e.g., lbO Cong. Rec.\n54260, 54268 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statements of\nSens. Feinstein & Kyt). Of course. no such\nlimitation would have been necessary under\nthe CVRA if CVRA rights attach (as the Department\nseems to think) only after the filing\nof a grand jury indictment.\nCourts have already rejected the Justice\nDepartment's position that the CVRA applies\nonly after an indictment is filed.. For\nexample, in In re Dean, b2T F.gd 891 (bth Cir.\n2008), the Department took the position that\ncrime victims had no right to confer with\nprosecutors until after the Department had\nreached and signed a plea agreement with a\ncorporation (BP Products North America)\nwhose illegal actions had resulted in the\ndeaths of fifteen workers in an oil refinery\nexplosion. Of course, this position meant\nthat the victims could. have no role in shaping\nany plea deal that the Department\nreached. In rejecting the Department's position,\nthe Fifth Circuit held that ,,the govern_\nment should have fashioned a reasonable\nway to inform the victims of the likelihood\nof criminal charges and to ascertain the victims'\nviews on the possible details of a plea\nbargain.\" Id. at 394.\nIn spite of this binding d.ecision from the\nFifth Circuit, crime victims' ad.vocates have\nreported to me that the Justice Department\nis still proceeding in the Fifth Ciicuit and\nelsewhere on the assumption that it has no\nobligations to treat victims fairly or to con_\nfer with them until after charges are for_\nmally filed. Given the Fifth Circuit,s Dean\ndecision, this position appears to place the\nDepartment in violation of a binding court\nruling that extend.s rights to thousand.s of\ncrime victims in Louisiana, Mississippi, and\nTexas. And more generally, the bepart_\nment's position simply has no grounding in\nthe clear language of the CVRA.\nMy first question: What is the Justice De_\npartment doing to extend to victims their\nSRIME VI6TIMS, RIGIIT To AppETTLATE\npRorEcrroN\nProtection of crime victims' rights in appellate\ncourts is an important part of the\nCVRA. As you know, when Congress passed\nthe CVRA, the federal courts of appeals had\nrecognized that crime victims could take ordinary\nappeals to protect their rights. See,\ne.g., Doe u. United States, 666 F.2d 43, 46 (4th\nCir. 1981) (rape victim allowed to appeal district\ncourt's adverse \"rape shield statute\"\nruling); United States v. Kones,77 F.3d 66 (3rd\nCir. 1996) (victim allowed to appeal adverse\nrestitution decision). Congress sought to\nleave these protections in place, while expanding\nthem to ensure that crime victims\ncould obtain quick vindication of their\nrights in appellate courts by providing-in\n$3771(d)(3)-that \"[i]f the district court denies\nthe relief sought, the [victim] may petition\nthe court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.\"\n18 U.S.C. S3771(d)(3). Ordinarily,\nwhether mandamus relief should issue is d.iscretionary.\nThe plain language of the CVRA,\nhowever, specifically and clearly overruled.\nsuch discretionary mandamus standard.s by\ndirecting that \"[t]he court of appeals shall\ntake up and decide such application forthwith\n. . . .\" 18 U.S.C. S3771(d)(3) (emphasis added).\nAs I explained when the Senate considered\nthe CVRA:\n[W]hile mandamus is generally discretionary,\nthis provision [18 U.S.C. gB??1(d)(g)]\nmeans that courts must review these cases.\nAppeilate review of denials of victims' rights\nis just as important as the initial assertion\nof a victim's right. This provision ensures review\nand encourages courts to broadlg d.efend.\nthe victims' rights.\n150 CoNG. REc. 54270 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement\nof Sen. Kyl) (emphases added). Simi-\nIarly, the CVRA's co-sponsor with me, Senator\nFeinstein, stated that the Act would\ncreate \"a new use of a very old procedure,\nthe writ of mandamus. This provision will\nestablish a procedure where a crime victim\ncan, in essence, immediately appeal a d.enial\nof their rights by a trial court to the court\nof appeals.\" 150 CoNG. REc. 54262 (statement\nof Sen. Feinstein) (emphases added); see also\nid. (statement of Sen. Kyl) (crime victims\nmust \"be able to have the appellate\ncourts take the appeal and order relief). In\nshort, the legislative history shows that\n$ 3771(d)(3) was intended to allow crime victims\nto take accelerated appeats from dis_\ntrict court decisions denying their rights and\nhave their appeals reviewed. under ord.inary\nstandards of appellate review.\nIn spite of that unequivocal legislative history,\nthe Justice Department has in past\ncases asserted a contrary position. In In re\nAntrobus, 519 F.3d 1123 (10th Cir. 200g). Ken\nand Sue Antrobus sought to obtain appellate\nreview of a ruling by a trial court that they\ncould not deliver a victim impact statement\nat the sentencing of the man who sold the\nmurder weapon used to kill their daug:hter.\nThe Tenth Circuit ruled against them on the\nbasis that the Antrobuses were not entiiled\nto regular appellate review, but only discre_\ntionary mandamus review. See id. at Il24_25.\nThe Tenth Circuit did not consider the legis_\nlative history in reaching this conclusion,\nleading the Antrobuses to file petitions for\nrehearing and rehearing en banc-petitions\nthat recounted this legislative history. In re_\nsponse, the Justice Department asked the\nTenth Circuit to deny the victims' petitions.\nRemarkably, the Justice Department told\nthe Tenth Circuit that it could ignore the\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 85-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2011 Page 4 of 4\nJune 8, 2011\nIegislative history because the CVRA \"is unambiguous.\"\nResponse of the United States,\nIn re Antrobzs, No. 08-4002, at 72 n.7 (10th Cir.\nFeb. 12, 2008).\nAt the time that the Justice Department\nfiled this brief, no Court of Appeals agreed\nwith the Tenth Circuit. At the time, three\nother Circuits had all issued unanimous rulings\nthat crime victims were entitled to regular\nappellate review. See /n re W.R,. Hufl\nAsset Mgmt. Co.,409 F.3d 555, 562 (2d Cir. 2005);\nKenna, u. US. Dist. Ct. for the Cent. Dist. of Ca.,\n435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2006): In re Walsh,\n229 Fed.Appx. 58, at 60 (3rd Cir. 2007).\nMy next question for you is, given that the\nJustice Department has an obligation to use\nits \"best efforts,\" 18 U.S.C. $377f(c)(1), to afford\ncrime victims their rights, how coutd\nthe Department argue in Antrobus (and later\ncases) that the CVRA \"unambiguously\" denied\ncrime victims regular appellate protections\nof their rights when three circuits had\nreached the opposite conclusion?\nGOVERNME}TT'S RIGIIT TO ASSERT ERROR\nDENIAL OF VICTIMS' RIGI{TS\nTo further bolster protection of crime victims'\nrights, Congress also included an ad.ditional\nprovision in the CVRA---SBZT1(dX4)-\nallowing the Justice Department to obtain\nreview of crime victims' rights issues in appeals\nfiled by defendants: ,,In any appeal in\na criminal case, the Government may assert\nas error the district court's denial of any\ncrime victim's right in the proceeding to\nwhich the appeal relates.\" 18 U.S.C.\n$3771(d)(4). The intent underlying this provision\nwas to supplement the crime victims'\nappeal provision found in gBTZI(d)(B) by permitting\nthe Department to also help develop\na body of case law expanding crime victims,\nrights in the many defense appeals that are\nfiled. It was not intended to in any way narrow\ncrime victims' rights to seek relief\nunder S3771(dX3). Nor was it intended to bar\ncrime victims from asserting other remedies.\nFor instance, it was not intend.ed. to block\ncrime victims from taking an ordinary appeal\nfrom an adverse decision affecting their\nrights (such as a decision denying restitution)\nunder 28 U.S.C. 51291. Crime victims\nhad been allowed to take such appeals in various\ncircuits even before the passage of the\nCVRA. See, e.9., United States u. Kones. 77\nF.3d 66 (3rd Cir. 1996) (crime victim allowed.\nto appeal restitution ruling); United, States u.\nPerry,360 F.3d 519 (6th Cir. 2004) (crime victims\nallowed to appeal restitution lien\nissue); Doe u. United States,666 F.2d 48.46 (4th\nCir. 1981) (crime victim allowed. to appeal\nrape shield ruling).\nAs I explained at the time the CVRA was\nunder consideration, this provision supplemented\nthose pre-existing d.ecisions by\n\"allow[ing] the Government to assert a victim's\nright on appeal even when it is the de_\nfendant who seeks appeal of his or her con_\nviction. This ensures that victims' rights are\nprotected throughout the criminal justice\nprocess and that they do not fall by the way_\nside during what can often be an extend.ed.\nappeal that the victim is not a party to.\" 1b0\nCoNG. REc. 54270 (Apr.22,2004) (statement of\nSen. Kyl).\nI have heard from crime victims' advocates\nthat the Department has not been actively\nenforcing this provision. Indeed, these ad.vocates\ntell me that they are unaware of even\na single case where the Department has used.\nthis supplemental remedy. My final question:\nIs it true that the Department has\nnever used this provision in even a single\ncase in the more than six years since the\nCVRA was enacted?\nSincerely,\nJoN KyL,\nU.S. Senator.\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD\n-\nSENATE\nHONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\nSERGEANT VORASACK T. XAYSANA\nMr. BENNET. Mr. President. it is\nwith a heavy heart that I rise today to\nhonor the life and heroic service of\nSGT Vorasack T. Xaysana. Sergeant\nXaysana, assigned to the Headquarters\nand Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion,\nbased in Fort Hood, TX, died on\nApril 10, 2011. Sergeant Xaysana was\nserving in support of Operation New\nDawn in Kirkuk, Iraq. He was 30 years\nold.\nA native of Westminster, CO, Sergeant\nXaysana enlisted in the Army in\n2005. During over 6 years of service, he\ndistinguished himself through his courage\nand dedication to duty. Sergeant\nXaysana's exemplary service quickly\nwon the recognition of his commanding\nofficers. He earned, among other decorations,\nthe Iraq Campaign Medal, the\nGlobal War on Temorism Service\nMedal, and the Army Good Conduct\nMedal.\nSergeant Xaysana worked on the\nfront lines of battle, serving in the\nmost dangerous areas of Iraq. Mark\nTwain once said, \"The fear of death fol-\nIows from the fear of life. A man who\nlives fully is prepared to die at any\ntime.\" Sergeant Xaysana's service was\nin keeping with this sentiment-by\nselflessly putting country first, he\nlived life to the fullest. He lived with a\nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\nAt substantial personal risk, he\nbraved the chaos of combat zones\nthroughout Iraq. Though his fate on\nthe battlefield was uncertain. he\npushed forward, protecting America's\ncitizens, her safety, and the freedoms\nwe hold dear. For his service and the\nlives he touched, Sergeant Xaysana\nwill forever be remembered as one of\nour country's bravest.\nTo Sergeant Xaysana's parents,\nThong Chanh and Manithip, and to his\nentire family, I cannot imagine the\nsorrow you must be feeling. I hope\nthat, in time, the pain of your loss will\nbe eased by your pride in Vorasack's\nservice and by your knowledge that his\ncountry will never forget him. We are\nhumbled by his service and his sacrifice.\nGRAZING IMPR,OVEMENT ACT\nMr. BARRASSO. Mr. president, I rise\ntoday to submit for the REcoRD an article\nwritten by Karen Budd-Falen and\npublished May 28, 2011, in the Wyoming\nLivestock Journal. The article's tiile is\n\"Leveling the Playing Field: Support\nfor the Grazing Improvement Act of\n2071.\"\nThe title of the article is instructive.\nAnyone living and working in rural\ncommunities knows the playing field is\nnot level. The National Environmental\nPolicy Act has become the preferred\ntool to delay and iitigate grazing permit\nrenewals for American ranchers.\nLivestock grazing on public lands has\na strong tradition in Wyoming and all\nWestern States. Ranchers aie proud\ns3609\nstewards of the land, yet the permitting\nprocess to renew their permits is\nseverely backlogged due to litigation\naimed at eliminating livestock from\npublic land.\nDuring times of high unemployment\nand increasing food prices, we need to\nbe encouraging jobs in rural economies.\nWe need to be fostering an environment\nto raise more high quality, safe,\nAmerican beef and lamb; not litigating\nless.\nThat is why I introduced the Grazing\nImprovement Act of 2011. This legisiation\nwill provide the certainty and stability\npublic grazing permit holders\ndesperately need in order to continue\nsupporting rural jobs, providing\nhealthy food, and maintaining open\nspaces for recreation and wildlife.\nIt is time to help level the playing\nfield for hard working ranching families\nacross the West. Their livelihood\nshould not be held hostage by litigation\nand anti-grazing special interest\ngroups. I thank my colleagues, Senators\nENzr, CRApo, HATOH, HELLER,\nRrscH, and TnuwE, in supporting ranching\nfamilies and this legislation.\nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent\nto have printed in the RpconD the\narticle to which I referred.\nThere being no objection, the material\nwas ordered to be printed in the\nRncoRo. as follows:\n[From the Wyoming Livestock Roundup,\nMay 28, 20111\nLEVELTNG rnp Pr,eyruc Frulo: SuppoRT FoR\nTHE GRAZING IMPRoVEMENT AcT oF 2Ou\n(By Karen Budd-Falen)\nIf jobs and the economy are the number\none concern for America, why are rural communities\nand ranchers under attack by radical\nenvironmental groups and overzealous\nfederal regulators?\nAmerica depends upon the hundreds of\nproducts that livestock provide, yet radical\ngroups and oppressive regulations make it\nalmost impossible for ranchers to stay in\nbusiness. Opposition to these jobs comes in\nthe form of litigation by radical environmental\ngroups to eliminate grazing on public\nlands, radical environmental group pressure\nto force \"voluntary\" gtazing permit buyouts\nfrom \"willing sellers,\" and holding permittees\nhostage to the court deference given\nto regulatory \"experts.\" The playing field is\nnot level and the rancher is on the losing\nside. The Grazing Improvement Act of 2011\nwill level the playing field. I urge your sup_\nport.\nThe Grazing Improvement Act of 2011 does\nthe following:\n1. Term of Grazing Leases and permits.\nBoth BLM and Forest Service term grazing\npermits are for a 10-year term. This bill ex_\ntends that term to 20 years.
