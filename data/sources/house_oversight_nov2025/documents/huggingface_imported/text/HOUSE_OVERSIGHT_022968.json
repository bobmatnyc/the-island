  "text": "and lovers, or offers an ass-backwards sort of deal in which Epstein has to\ngo to the Palm Beach authorities and convince them to charge him with an\noffense that will send him to jail and get him a sex offender status. Except\nthat a solicitation charge won’t produce that result. Therefore he has to agree\nalso to a procurement or pimping charge (even though he has paid money,\nnot received it—the sine qua non of pimping). What’s more, he has to agree\nto pay the legal fees of any of the girls who want to sue him—and, not to\ndefend himself in their suits—forcing him to settle with each of the girls for\nwhat are reportedly high 6-figure sums or more.\n\nHe’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13.\n\nThis hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo\nRodriguez, steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with\nEpstein’s activities—but he tries to sell it to an undercover agent. Rodriguez\nis sentenced to 18 months in jail on a charge of theft and of withholding\nevidence. Scott Rothstein, a lawyer whose firm represented additional girls\nin their suits against Epstein, also goes to jail for recruiting investors to pay\nfor these suits on the fraudulent basis that settlements had already been\nreached.\n\nThen, Brad Edwards, Rothstein’s former partner, sues the government\nin 2008 for abridging their rights under the Victim Rights Act (under which\nvictims have the right to be consulted). In 2014, tries to ad Virginia Roberts,\none of the original complainants, who has previously settled with Epstein, to\nthe long-running suit—and is now, with Edwards, further suing him for\n$50,000,000.\n\nRoberts who has been the most vocal of the accusers, with the Daily\nMail being her prime outlet, emerges now, more than ten years after the fact,\nwith what is billed as a memoir of her “sex slavery” with Epstein, written ten\nyears after the fact. She names a number of people as being at Epstein’s\nIsland home, including Clinton and Al Gore and his wife, who Epstein\ninsists were never there—proof available through secret service records.\n\nIt is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers\nthen in Epstein’s case.\n\nEdwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton,\nDonald Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly\nfrom the original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about\nEpstein.\n\nIn addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to\nEpstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton\ntakes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or\nimagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022968",
