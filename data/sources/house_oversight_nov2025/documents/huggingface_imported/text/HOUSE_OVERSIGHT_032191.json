  "text": "21\n\ndifferences between their departments, and working with a younger\ngeneration, the two have bonded.\n\n\"Hillary and I call ourselves the Old Folks Caucus,\" Gates quips.\n\"And I must say, it's the first time in my life I've worked for a\npresident who was 20 years younger than I was.\"\n\nGates's tenure had difficult moments, too. Three years ago, he\nrejected requests from Gen. David McKiernan, his then top\ncommander in Afghanistan, for more troops, believing there weren't\nenough resources. Gates stayed the course until 2009, when he\nargued for the troop surge that now appears to have stalled the\ninsurgency.\n\nGates acknowledges a historical similarity to the Vietnam War.\n\"There is one parallel that I think is appropriate, and that is we came\nto the right strategy and the right resources very late in the game,\"\nGates says. \"President Obama, I think, got the right strategy and the\nright resources for Afghanistan--but eight years in.\"\n\nIn Afghanistan, Gates leaves behind a difficult, unfinished piece of\nbusiness: to convince Congress and war-weary Americans that any\nmajor U.S. withdrawal should be delayed by a year--a deferment\nsought by military commanders on the ground. Likewise, Gates won't\nbe around for what may be the most delicate aspect of the exit\nstrategy--trying to broker reconciliation between the Taliban and the\nAfghan ruling parties aligned with the U.S.\n\n\"I'm not saying it'll all be settled,\" says Gates. \"I'm just saying you\ncould begin a serious dialogue by the end of the year.\" But, he\nconcedes, \"asking for another year is hard.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032191",
