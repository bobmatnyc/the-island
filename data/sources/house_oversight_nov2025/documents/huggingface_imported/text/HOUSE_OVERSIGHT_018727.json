It performs many administrative functions formerly carried out by the former United\nStates Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which was part of the Department of Justice.\nThe stated priorities of the USCIS are to promote national security, to eliminate immigration case backlogs,\nand to improve customer services. USCIS is headed by a director, currently Leon Rodriguez, who reports\ndirectly to the Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security. USCIS consists of 18,000 federal employees and\ncontractors working at 250 offices around the world.\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services\nUSCIS is charged with processing immigrant visa petitions, naturalization petitions, and asylum and refugee\napplications, as well as making adjudicative decisions performed at the service centers, and managing all\nother immigration benefits functions (i.e., not immigration enforcement).\nUSCIS’ official website is USCIS.gov which includes an online appointment scheduling service known as\nINFOPASS. This system allows people with questions about immigration to come into their local USCIS\noffice and speak directly with a government employee about their case. Additionally, USCIS maintains a\nblog entitled “The Beacon” as well as the “@uscis” Twitter account.\nUnlike most other federal agencies, USCIS is funded almost entirely by user fees. Under President George\nW. Bush’s FY2008 budget request, direct congressional appropriations made about 1% of the USCIS budget\nand about 99% of the budget was funded through fees. The total USCIS FY2008 budget was projected to\nbe $2.6 billion.\nExceptional Credit Tenancy –\nBoasting an “AA+” credit rating by S&P and an “Aaa” credit rating by Moody’s, the lease is guaranteed by\nthe United States of America.\nHigh Renewal Probability –\nThe General Services Administration’s lease renewal probability is 96% in new, first generation space such\nas the Property, and the GSA remains in its space for over 25 years on average.\nPage 12 GSA Investment & Acquisition Opportunity | St Thomas, USVI THE NET LEASE AUTHORITY ®\nSite Plan\nCitizenship and Immigration Services\n12,770 SF Facility to-be Constructed 2015-2016\nMission-Critical, Consolidation of CIS Offices –\nSt. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands\nN\nPage 13 GSA Investment & Acquisition Opportunity | St Thomas, USVI THE NET LEASE AUTHORITY ®\nN\nPage 14 GSA Investment & Acquisition Opportunity | St Thomas, USVI THE NET LEASE AUTHORITY ®\nLocation Overview\nSaint Thomas is an island in the Caribbean Sea –\ndirectly east of Puerto Rico. Together with St. John and\nWater Island, St. Thomas forms a county and constituent\ndistrict of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), an\nunincorporated territory of the United States. Located\non the island of Saint Thomas is the territorial capital\nand port of Charlotte Amalie. As of the 2010 census, the\npopulation of Saint Thomas was 51,634 about 48.5% of\nthe US Virgin Islands total. The district has a land area of\n31.24 square miles.\nIn 1917, St. Thomas was purchased (along with Saint\nJohn and Saint Croix) by the United States for $25\nmillion in gold, as part of a defensive strategy to\nmaintain control over the Caribbean and the Panama\nCanal during the First World War. U.S. citizenship was\ngranted to the residents of St. Thomas in 1927 and the\nU.S. Department of the Interior took over administrative\nduties in 1931. American forces were based on the island\nduring the Second World War and the 1954, passage\nof the U.S. Virgin Islands Organic Act officially granted\nterritorial status to the three islands - St. Thomas, St.\nJohn, and Water Island.\nSt. Thomas has a lively tourist trade. It is the USVI’s most\ncosmopolitan island, yet it still retains the distinctive\natmosphere of a secluded Caribbean paradise. St.\nThomas is packed with many tourism activities including\nshopping, sailing, snorkeling, sightseeing, diving and\ndining. The Island is home to a world-renowned golf\ncourse, picture-perfect beaches and a spectacular\nnightlife. Other attractions are the Skyride (700 feet\nabove the city) and the famous 99 Steps of Charlotte\nAmalie for an incomparable view of the Caribbean, as\nwell as the second-oldest synagogue in the Western\nHemisphere, the 1680-built Fort Christian.\nSt. Thomas is developed with many hotels offering a\nvariety of lodging alternatives from grand resort estates\nto small inns and villas. It is also a destination for many\nCaribbean cruises due to the Island’s breathtaking views,\nsecluded beaches and a deeply relaxing atmosphere.\nSt. Thomas\nSt. Thomas\nSt. Thomas\nSt. Thomas\nPage 15 GSA Investment & Acquisition Opportunity | St Thomas, USVI THE NET LEASE AUTHORITY ®\nMark Hellwig | Director\nmhellwig@stanjohnsonco.com\nBrandon Duff | Regional Director\nbduff@stanjohnsonco.com\nBrad Feller | Senior Director\nbfeller@stanjohnsonco.com\nJessica Hyman | Senior Analyst\njhyman@stanjohnsonco.com\nIn Association With:\nSea Glass Properties\nUSVI Lic #1-10718-1B\nStan Johnson Company\n303 East Wacker Drive | Suite 1111\nChicago, Illinois 60601\nP: 312.240.0127 | F: 312.240.0158\nwww.stanjohnsonco.com\nThe information contained herein was obtained from sources believed reliable, however, Stan Johnson Company makes no guaranties, warranties or representations as to the\ncompleteness thereof.
