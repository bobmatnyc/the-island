  "text": "° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of\nthe room.\n\nIncident 2:\n\n° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve\nUniversity, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it\nmust be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.\n\n° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student\nvisited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored\nthe questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.\n\n° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without\nmentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought\ndifferently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me\nupset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.\n\n° She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you,\nbased on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and\nshe did.\n\n° University investigators interviewed both you and the student.\n\n° On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university’s associate vice president for student\naffairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told:\n“This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university’s sexual harassment\npolicy.”\n\n° The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she\nremained at Case.\n\n° The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics\ndepartment before setting foot on the campus again.\n\n° The letter also stated, “Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also\nhis willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with\nstudents.”\n\n° By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the\nmonth before.\n\n° “The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,”\nyou told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008.\n\nIncident 3:\n\n° A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous\nincident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her.\n\nIncident 4:\n\n° You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists\nConvention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she\nwas attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic.\n\n° During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student\nand volunteers for Dawkins’ foundation.\n\n° Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink.\n\n° You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a\n\nmale friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.\n° You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021421",
