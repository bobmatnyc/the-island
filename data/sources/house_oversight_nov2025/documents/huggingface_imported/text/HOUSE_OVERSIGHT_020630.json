Since entering government, Yang “has been a central figure\npromoting and helping to shape the New Zealand National government’s China\nstrategy” and was a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee for Foreign Affairs,\nDefense, and Trade from 2014 to 2016, which would have given him privileged access\nto information.*\n\nChinese influence efforts targeted toward New Zealand politics transcend the diaspora\ncommunity to include campaign contributions and the cultivation of relationships with\nformer senior officials. Individuals with strong ties to United Front organizations have\ndonated several million dollars, primarily to the National Party. One such individual, who\ndonated $112,000 to the National Party in 2017, is listed as an officer of no fewer than\nseven United Front organizations.® Senior politicians who have secured high-profile roles\nin Chinese companies include a former party leader and members of Parliament who\nserve on the boards of the New Zealand affiliates of major Chinese banks. A former\nminister of finance serves on the board of a majority-Chinese-owned New Zealand\ndairy. In late September, a former prime minister who now represents an American\ncompany’s interests in China attracted attention for the sale of property “well above\nmarket rates” to an undisclosed Chinese buyer. Local politicians have also been\ntargeted.\n\nBusiness\n\nChinese companies have also been instruments of interference in New Zealand. After\nacquiring a stake in a local telecom company in 2011, Chinese telecom giant Huawei\nwent on to win the contract to build New Zealand’s 4G wireless network in 2013.\nHuawei also established research partnerships and other investments in the country\nthat may be leveraged for nonbusiness purposes. In another instance, New Zealand\naeronautics company Pacific Aerospace in 2014 partnered with Beijing Automotive\nGroup on the sale of planes to the Chinese market. In 2017, Pacific Aerospace was\ncharged by New Zealand Customs with knowingly and illegally exporting parts to\nNorth Korea via its Chinese partner.\n\nUniversities\n\nNew Zealand has long-standing scientific cooperation agreements with China, most\nof which are benign. However, since China renewed an emphasis on civil-military\nresearch integration in 2015, New Zealand, like other countries hosting major\nresearch institutions, has been targeted for its potential to further these aims. New\nZealand universities have partnerships with several Chinese universities linked to\nChina’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), including the PLA Institute of Military\nCulture (Massey); the National University of Defense Technology (Auckland, Massey);\nNorthwestern Polytechnical University (Canterbury), Shenyang Aerospace University\n\nAppendix 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020630",
