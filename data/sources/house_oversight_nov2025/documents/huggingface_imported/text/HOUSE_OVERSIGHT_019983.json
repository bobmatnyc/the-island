  "text": "publicity-shy man, was eating up the camera. He was a country music star—he was\nJohnny Cash. He seized Priebus’s hand in a power handshake, then relaxed in his chair as\nPriebus came too eagerly forward in his.\n\nPriebus opened with traditional bromides. Bannon, taking his turn, went wryly for the\ndig: “I want to thank you for finally inviting me to CPAC.”\n\n“We decided to say that everybody is a part of our conservative family,” said Matt\nSchlapp, resigned. He then welcomed “the back of the room,” where the hundreds of\nreporters covering the event were positioned.\n\n“Is that the opposition party?” asked Bannon, shielding his eyes.\nSchlapp went to the setup question: “We read a lot about you two. Ahem ...”\n“It’s all good,” replied Priebus tightly.\n\n“Til bet not all of it’s accurate,” said Schlapp. “Ill bet there’s things that don’t get\nwritten correctly. Let me ask both of you, what’s the biggest misconception about what’s\ngoing on in the Donald Trump White House?”\n\nBannon responded with something just less than a smirk and said nothing.\nPriebus offered a testimonial to the closeness of his relationship with Bannon.\n\nBannon, eyes dancing, lifted the microphone trumpetlike and made a joke about\nPriebus’s commodious office—two couches and a fireplace—and his own rough-and-\nready one.\n\nPriebus hewed to the message. “It’s, ahh ... it’s actually ... something that you all have\nhelped build, which is, when you bring together, and what this election shows, and what\nPresident Trump showed, and let’s not kid ourselves, I can talk about data and ground\ngame and Steve can talk about big ideas but the truth of the matter is Donald Trump,\nPresident Trump, brought together the party and the conservative movement, and I tell you\nif the party and the conservative movement are together’—Priebus knocked his fists\n\n“similar to Steve and I, it can’t be stopped. And President Trump is the one guy, he was\nthe one person, and I can say this after overseeing sixteen people kill each other, it was\nDonald Trump who was able to bring this country, this party, and this movement together.\nAnd Steve and I know that and we live it every day and our job is to get the agenda of\nPresident Trump through the door and on pen and paper.”\n\nWith Priebus gasping for breath, Bannon snatched the relay baton. “I think if you look\nat the opposition party’—throwing his hand out to the back of the room—“and how they\nportrayed the campaign, how they portrayed the transition, and now how they are\nportraying the administration, it’s always wrong.
