Net of distortions and seasonal\nadjustments, it looks like payroll growth is running at 150-175k per month, and GDP growth is running at a 2.25% trend\npace, both below prior recoveries. While 2.25% is a barn-burner compared to Europe, it only corresponds to a modest\nimprovement in employment. That’s why 2013 US fiscal policy is so important: this is not a recovery that can\nwithstand much tighter fiscal conditions.\n\nSo, how tight is US fiscal policy supposed to get next year?\n\nVery, if you look at what is supposed to happen according to current law. In the chart, we show the annual change in the\nbudget deficit over the last 25 years. The impact of all provisions scheduled to expire and kick in during 2013 would be\nvery large. But if Congress and the President elect to extend current tax rates, retain lower payroll tax rates and extended\njobless benefits, etc, the adjustment would not be as big, and only reflect expiration of Recovery Act provisions, the\nrecently passed Budget Control Act, and some other smaller provisions. There are of course plenty of permutations in\nbetween.\n\nWide range of outcomes for 2013 austerity Policies set to expire or take | Fiscal Drag (%\nChange in cyclically-adjusted federal deficit, % of potential GDP effect under current law of 2013 PGDP)\n\n] Sequester Automatic Cuts\n\n5 4 9,\n44 = — (Discretionary Spending) 0.4%\n34 Sequester Automatic Cuts\n2013 3 0.1%\n27 scenario (Mandatory Spending)\n14 estimates Bush Tax Cuts ($250k+ ;\n| 0.3%\n0 ncomes, Estate Tax)\n14 l Congress Bush Tax Cuts (Middle Income) 0.9%\n-2 4 | punts Alternative Minimum Tax 0.8%\n2] Payroll Tax Cut 0.6%\n= Current yU | t\n4 .Fiscaldrag law Pllecamkett nemploy men 0.2%\n1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013 mpensation\nSource: CBO, IMF, Goldman Sachs, J.P.

Ifso, Congress can point to a March\n2012 paper by Summers and DeLong as justification. The bottom line from the paper: don’t tighten fiscal policy when\ninterest rates are near zero. The authors assert that (a) additional government spending can ease the long-term budget\nconstraint in conditions similar to today’s, and (b) tightening policy now would risk permanent loss of human capital,\nlower labor productivity growth and lower trend growth. They have held these views for a while; the paper appears\ndesigned to convince others.\n\nAdvocates for more fiscal and monetary stimulus often point to the charts below. Rising Federal debt has not resulted in\nhigher interest rates, so why not keep borrowing more? As for the Fed, balance sheet expansion prevented deflation and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025236",
