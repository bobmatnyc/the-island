  "text": "L£/0 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nsixty years monitored government communications. It had also kept\ntrack of adversaries’ missile telemetry, submarine movements, and\nnuclear proliferation.\n\nThe Snowden breach was not without precedent at the NSA.\nThere had been two Russian spies at the NSA during the Cold\nWar, Jack Dunlap and David Sheldon Boone, who took a limited\nnumber of documents, but no one since the end of the Cold War\nis known to have taken a single NSA classified document. Now an\ninsider had removed a vast number of the NSA’s documents. Many\nof these documents were classified TS/SCI—“Top Secret, Sensitive\nCompartmented Information”—which, as NSA secrets went, were\ndeemed the gold standard of espionage because they revealed the\nsources used in communications intelligence. Whatever the assess-\nment of Snowden’s motivation, the single question that needed to be\nanswered was, what happened to these stolen files?\n\nRecall the huge disparity between the number of documents that\nthe NSA calculated that Snowden compromised and the number of\ndocuments he is known to have handed over to journalists in Hong\n\n© Kong on a thumb drive. When the House and Senate Intelligence ©\nCommittees asked the NSA how many documents Snowden took,\nthe NSA could not come up with a definitive number despite having\nemployed a world-class team of experts to reconstruct the crime. The\nNSA could say that 1.7 million documents had been selected in two\ndozen NSA computers during Snowden’s brief tenure at Booz Allen\nin 2013, including documents from the Department of Defense, the\nNSA, and the CIA. Of these “touched” documents, some 1.3 million\nhad been copied and moved to another computer.\n\nThere was evidence that Snowden had used preprogrammed spi-\nders to find and index the documents. He had said that he took the\njob at Booz Allen to get access to data that he copied. So as far as the\nNSA was concerned, of course, the 1.3 million documents he cop-\nied and moved were considered compromised. On top of this haul,\nSnowden had copied files while working at Dell in 2012. As a sys-\ntem administrator there, he could download data without leaving a\ndigital trail. As previously mentioned, more than half the documents\nactually published in newspapers had been taken during Snowden’s\ntime at Dell.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 170 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019658",
