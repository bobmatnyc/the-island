Big\nobstacle has been overcome: Enough US\nSenators support to ensure it can move\nforward.\n\n- Saudi Arabia “supports” the deal. The\nSaudi king was in DC last month. US has\nquietly promised nuclear protection and\nmassive weapons sales.\n\n- Market implications of a deal are\nsignificant, especially for European\ncorporates eager to get back into Iran\nmarketplace (i.e. Italian PM Renzi already\nvisited Tehran as has German FM).\n\n- Iran wants to build 400 four & five star\nhotels in next five to ten years.\n\n- But do not expect any significant oil\nexport increase and/or sales into Iran for at\nleast 8 — 10 months. Iran must first comply\nand set up systems for inspections.\n\nDeutsche Bank Francis J.
