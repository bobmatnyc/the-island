Introduction\nFederal courts should treat crime victims fairly in the criminal process. In a nod to that goal, the Advisory Committee on the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Advisory Committee) has circulated for public comment proposed amendments to the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure (the Rules) regarding crime victims' rights. These amendments attempt to implement the\nrecently-enacted Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 1 which guarantees crime victims a series of rights, including the right to\nbe treated fairly. Unfortunately, the proposed amendments are mere tentative, half measures that do not begin to fully protect\ncrime victims.\nThis Article contends that the Advisory Committee should broaden its vision of the proper role for crime victims and\nrecommend far more expansive victim protections. In the CVRA, Congress articulated specific rights for crime victims, such as\nthe right to be notified of court hearings, to attend those hearings, and to speak at appropriate points in the process. 2 But along\nwith these specific rights came the sweeping requirement that crime victims \"be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim's dignity and privacy.\" 3 This congressional command must not be ignored. In addition, entirely apart from any\ncongressional dictate, crime victims deserve fair treatment in the federal system. Acting for the federal judiciary, the Advisory\nCommittee should make certain that the Rules fully reflect victims' interests rather than allow the initiative for protecting\nvictims to pass to other branches of government.\nThis Article proceeds in five parts. Following this Introduction, Part II reviews events leading to the recently circulated\namendments. The amendments were prompted by the CVRA - an act passed by Congress in 2004 to protect victims' rights\nthrough the federal criminal process. To comply with the CVRA, the federal criminal rules had to be amended in many places,\n1\nPub. L. No. 108-405, § 102(a), 118 Stat. 2260, 2261-62 (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (Supp. 2006)).\n2\n18 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(2)-(4).\n3\nId. § 3771(a)(8).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *863\nPage 2 of 78\nas I argued at length in an earlier article. 4 After receiving my suggested changes, the Advisory Committee agreed with some,\nbut declined to adopt many of the others. At issue for the Advisory Committee was whether to proceed narrowly by changing\nonly a few rules to track specific congressional directives or to proceed more broadly by reworking the entire body of federal\ncriminal rules to ensure that they are all fair to crime victims. The Committee opted for the narrower approach.\nPart III of this Article disputes the Advisory Committee's limited vision. Congress has required that the courts must treat crime\nvictims \"with fairness\" throughout the process. 5 The only way to fully implement that command is a [*864] thorough\nreworking of the federal criminal rules to integrate victims into the day-to-day workings of the process. The Committee's\nparsimonious amendments simply ignore that congressional directive and mean that, in practice, many of the federal criminal\nrules will continue to overlook the legitimate interests of crime victims.\nPart IV of this Article contains a rule-by-rule analysis of changes that should be made to the federal rules. The following\nchanges are of particular importance:\n1. Ensuring that crime victims' attorneys can appear in court (Rule 1);\n2. Providing for victim participation in the plea bargain process (Rule 11);\n3. Protecting victims' addresses and telephone numbers from improper disclosure (Rule 12);\n4. Guaranteeing victims the right to attend criminal depositions (Rule 15);\n5. Protecting victims from having personal and confidential information improperly subpoenaed (Rule 17);\n6. Considering victims' interests when cases are transferred or when a bench trial is ordered (Rules 21 and 23);\n7. Integrating victims into the sentencing process (Rule 32);\n8. Articulating victims' right to discretionary appointment of counsel (Rule 44.1);\n9. Giving victims the right to be heard at bail decisions (Rule 46);\n10. Requiring victims' views be considered before a case is dismissed (Rule 48);\n11. Protecting victims' right to a speedy trial (Rule 50);\n12. Giving victims notice of court proceedings and of their rights in those proceedings (Rule 60(a)(1));\n13. Guaranteeing victims the right to attend court proceedings (Rule 60(a)(2));\n14. Guaranteeing victims the right to be heard on bail, plea, sentencing, and other issues important to victims (Rule 60(a)(3)).\nFinally, Part V briefly concludes by explaining that the likely consequence of the Advisory Committee failing to fully\nimplement Congress's vision will be that Congress itself will step in to do the job. It would be unfortunate if the Judiciary were\nto abdicate its responsibilities to protect crime victims and leave the task to another branch of government.\nThis Article also contains a short Afterword, which recounts developments subsequent to the drafting of this Article in January\n2007.\n[*865]\nII. Victims' Rights, the CVRA, and Amendments to the Rules\n4\nSee Paul G. Cassell, Recognizing Victims in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure: Proposed Amendments in Light of the Crime\nVictims' Rights Act, 2005 BYU L. Rev. 835, 852-924 [hereinafter Cassell, Proposed Amendments].\n5\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *865\nPage 3 of 78\nA. The Crime Victims' Rights Movement\nThe Crime Victims' Rights Movement developed in the 1970s because of a perceived imbalance in the criminal justice system.\nThe victims' absence from criminal processes conflicted with \"a public sense of justice keen enough that … it has found voice\nin a nationwide \"victims' rights' movement.\" 6 Victims advocates argued that the criminal justice system had become\npreoccupied with defendants' rights to the exclusion of considering the legitimate interests of crime victims. 7 These advocates\nurged reforms to give more attention to victims' concerns, including protecting victims' rights to be notified of court hearings,\nto attend those hearings, and to be heard at appropriate points in the process.\nThe victims movement received considerable impetus in 1982 with the publication of the report of the President's Task Force\non Victims of Crime (\"Task Force\"). The Task Force concluded that \"the criminal justice system has lost an essential balance…\n. The system has deprived the innocent, the honest, and the helpless of its protection… . The victims of crime have been\ntransformed into a group oppressively burdened by a system designed to protect them. This oppression must be reddressed.\" 8\nThe Task Force advocated multiple reforms. It recommended that prosecutors assume the responsibility for keeping victims\nnotified of all court proceedings and bringing to the court's attention the victim's view on such subjects as bail, plea bargains,\nsentences, and restitution. 9 It also urged that courts receive victim-impact evidence at sentencing, order restitution in most\ncases, and allow victims and their families to attend trials even if they would [*866] be called as witnesses. 10 In its most\nsweeping recommendation, the Task Force proposed a federal constitutional amendment to protect crime victims' rights \"to be\npresent and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial proceedings.\" 11\nIn the wake of the recommendation for a constitutional amendment, crime victims' advocates considered how best to pursue\nthat goal. Realizing the difficulty of achieving the consensus required to amend the United States Constitution, advocates\ndecided to go first to the states to enact state victims' rights amendments. They have had considerable success with this \"statesfirst\"\nstrategy. 12 To date, about thirty states have adopted amendments to their own state constitutions, 13 which protect a\nwide range of victims' rights.\n6\nPayne v.

Rev. 861, *866\nPage 4 of 78\nThe Crime Victims' Rights Movement was also able to prod the federal system to recognize victims' rights. In 1982, Congress\npassed the first federal victims' rights legislation, the Victim and Witness Protection Act, which gave victims the right to make\nan impact statement at sentencing and provided expanded restitution. 14 Since then, Congress has passed several acts that\nfurther protected victims' rights, including the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, 15 the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of\n1990, 16 the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 17 the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996, 18 and the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. 19 Other federal statutes have been passed to deal with\nspecialized victim situations, such as child victims and witnesses. 20\nAmong these, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 is worth briefly highlighting. This act purported to create a\ncomprehensive list of victim's rights in the federal criminal justice process. The act commanded that \"[a] crime victim has the\nfollowing rights\" 21 and then listed various rights in the process. Among the [*867] rights were the right to \"be treated with\nfairness and with respect for the victims' dignity and privacy,\" 22 to \"be notified of court proceedings,\" 23 to \"confer with [the]\nattorney for the Government in the case,\" 24 and to attend court proceedings, even if called as a witness, unless the victim's\ntestimony \"would be materially affected\" by hearing other testimony at trial. 25 The statute also directed the Justice\nDepartment to make its \"best efforts\" to ensure that victims received their rights. 26 Yet this act never successfully integrated\nvictims into the federal criminal justice process and was generally regarded as something of a dead letter. Because Congress\npassed the CVRA in 2004 to remedy the problems with this law, it is worth briefly reviewing why it was largely unsuccessful.\nCuriously, the Victims' Rights Act was codified in Title 42 of the United States Code - the title dealing with \"Public Health and\nWelfare.\" As a result, the statute was generally unknown to federal judges and criminal law practitioners. Federal practitioners\nreflexively consult Title 18 for guidance on criminal law issues. More prosaically, federal criminal enactments are bound\ntogether in a single West publication - the Federal Criminal Code and Rules. This single publication is carried to court by\nprosecutors and defense attorneys and is on the desk of most federal judges. Because West Publishing never included the\nVictims' Rights Act in this book, the statute was essentially unknown even to the most experienced judges and attorneys. The\nprime illustration of the ineffectiveness of the Victims' Rights Act comes from the Oklahoma City bombing case, where victims\nwere denied rights protected by statute in large part because the rights were not listed in the criminal rules. 27\nBecause of such problems with the statutory protection of victims' rights, victims advocates decided in 1995 the time was right\nto press for a federal constitutional amendment. They argued that the statutory protections could not sufficiently guarantee\n14\nPub. L. No. 97-291, 96 Stat. 1248 (1982).\n15\nPub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2170 (1984).\n16\nPub. L.

Rev. 861, *867\nPage 5 of 78\nvictims' rights. In their view, such statutes \"frequently fail to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into conflict\nwith bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, [or] sheer inertia.\" 28 As the Justice Department reported:\nEfforts to secure victims' rights through means other than a constitutional amendment have proved less than fully adequate.\nVictims' rights advocates have sought reforms at the state level for the past twenty years, and many states have responded with\nstate statutes and [*868] constitutional provisions that seek to guarantee victims' rights. However, these efforts have failed to\nfully safeguard victims' rights. These significant state efforts simply are not sufficiently consistent, comprehensive, or\nauthoritative to safeguard victims' rights. 29\nTo place victims' rights in the constitution, victims advocates (led most prominently by the National Victims Constitutional\nAmendment Network 30 ) approached the President and Congress about a federal amendment. 31 In April 22, 1996, Senators\nKyl and Feinstein introduced a federal victims' rights amendment with the backing of President Clinton. 32 The intent of the\namendment was to \"restore, preserve, and protect, as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the practice of victim\nparticipation in the administration of criminal justice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of our Nation.\"\n33 A companion resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives. 34 The proposed amendment embodied seven core\nprinciples: (1) the right to notice of proceedings, (2) the right to be present, (3) the right to be heard, (4) the right to notice of\nthe defendant's release or escape, (5) the right to restitution, (6) the right to a speedy trial, and (7) the right to reasonable\nprotection. In a later resolution, an eighth principle was added: standing. 35\nThe amendment failed to pass in the 104th Congress. On January 21, 1997, the opening day of the first session of the 105th\nCongress, Senators Kyl and Feinstein reintroduced the amendment. 36 A series of hearings were held that year in both the\nHouse and the Senate. 37 Responding to some of the concerns raised in these hearings, the amendment was reintroduced the\nfollowing year. 38 The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings 39 and passed the proposed amendment. 40 However, the\nfull Senate did not consider the amendment. In 1999, Senators Kyl [*869] and Feinstein again proposed the amendment. 41\nOn September 30, 1999, the Judiciary Committee again voted to send the amendment to the full Senate. 42 But on April 27,\n28\nLaurence H.

Rev. 861, *869\nPage 6 of 78\n2000, after three days of floor debate, the amendment was shelved when it became clear that its opponents had the votes to\nsustain a filibuster. 43 At the same time, hearings were held in the House on the companion measure there. 44\nDiscussions about the amendment began again after the 2000 presidential elections. On April 15, 2002, Senators Kyl and\nFeinstein again introduced the amendment. 45 The following day, President Bush announced his support. 46 On May 1, 2002,\na companion measure was proposed in the House. 47 On January 7, 2003, Senators Kyl and Feinstein proposed the amendment\nas Senate Joint Resolution 1. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings in April of that year, 48 followed by a written\nreport supporting the amendment. 49 On April 20, 2004, a motion to proceed to consider the amendment was filed in the\nSenate. Shortly thereafter, the motion to proceed was withdrawn when proponents determined they did not have the sixty-seven\nvotes necessary to pass the measure. After it had become clear that the necessary super-majority votes were not available to\namend the Constitution, victims advocates turned their attention to enactment of a comprehensive victims' rights statute.\nB. The Crime Victims' Rights Act\nThe Crime Victims' Rights Act ultimately resulted from a decision by the victims' movement to seek a more comprehensive\nand enforceable federal statute rather than to pursue the dream of a federal constitutional amendment. In April 2004, victims\nadvocates met with Senators Kyl and Feinstein to decide whether to push again for a federal constitutional amendment.\nConcluding that the amendment lacked the required supermajority, the advocates decided to press for a far-reaching federal\nstatute protecting victims' rights in the federal criminal justice system. 50 In exchange for backing off from the constitutional\namendment in the short term, victims advocates received near universal congressional support for a \"broad and encompassing\"\nstatutory victims' bill of rights. 51 This \"new and bolder\" approach not only created a bill of rights for victims, but also\nprovided funding for victims' [*870] legal services and created remedies when victims' rights were violated. 52 The victims'\nmovement would then see how this statute worked in future years before deciding whether to continue to push for a federal\namendment. 53\nThe legislation that ultimately passed - the Crime Victims' Rights Act - gives victims \"the right to participate in the system.\" 54\nIt lists various rights for crime victims in the process of prosecuting the accused, including the right to be notified of court\nhearings, the right to attend those hearings, the right to be heard at appropriate points in the process, and the right to be treated\nwith fairness. 55 Rather than relying merely on the \"best efforts\" of prosecutors to vindicate the rights, the CVRA also contains\n42\n146 Cong.

Rev. 861, *870\nPage 7 of 78\nspecific enforcement mechanisms. 56 Most important, the CVRA directly confers standing onto victims to assert their rights, a\nflaw in the earlier enactment. 57 The act provides that rights can be \"asserted\" by \"the crime victim or the crime victim's lawful\nrepresentative, and the attorney for the Government.\" 58 The victim (or the government) may appeal any denial of a victim's\nright through a writ of mandamus on an expedited basis. 59 The courts are also required to \"ensure that the crime victim is\nafforded\" the rights given by the new law. 60 These changes were intended to make victims \"an independent participant in the\nproceedings.\" 61\nC. My Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nIn the wake of the CVRA, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure needed to be significantly amended to comply with the\nstatute's mandates. With this goal in mind, I prepared a comprehensive set of proposed amendments to the Rules and submitted\nthem to the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 62\nMy proposals began from the premise that \"victims now must be folded into the process through which federal courts conduct\ncriminal cases, including bail, plea, trial, and sentencing hearings.\" 63 Because the federal rules are the \"playbook\" [*871] of\nthe federal courts, it seemed advisable to reflect the new role of victims throughout the Rules. Moreover, Congress intended the\nCVRA to be \"a formula for success\" and a \"model for our States.\" 64 The only way the federal rules could serve as a model, I\nargued, was by fully implementing victims' rights. I then proposed twenty-eight specific changes to the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure to integrate crime victims into the federal process. 65 Each of these proposals included both specific text\nfor an amendment and a legal justification for the change.\nD. The Criminal Rules Committee Proposals\nThe Advisory Committee took up my proposed rule changes in the summer of 2005. The distinguished chair of the committee,\nJudge Susan Bucklew, appointed a subcommittee, chaired by Judge James Jones, to consider changes to the federal rules to\nimplement the CVRA. The Subcommittee, including its reporter, Professor Sara Sun Beale, prepared a report to the full\ncommittee recommending only a few changes to the Rules. 66 The Subcommittee \"felt that it would not be appropriate to\ncreate new victim rights not based upon the statute.\" 67 Accordingly, the Subcommittee recommended just a few changes to\nthe Rules, essentially parroting a few parts of the CVRA's language.\n56\nId.\n57\nCf.

Rev. 861, *871\nPage 8 of 78\nThe full Advisory Committee took up the Subcommittee's proposals at its meeting on October 24-25, 2005. 68 It largely agreed\nwith the Subcommittee's proposals, approving a limited set of changes to the Rules to implement the CVRA. The Advisory\nCommittee sent a report of its proposed changes to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure in December,\n2005. 69 The Advisory Committee described its changes as seeking \"to incorporate, but not go beyond, the rights created by\nthe statute.\" 70 The rules were then circulated for nationwide public comment. 71 The Advisory Committee held a public\nhearing on [*872] the rule change in Washington, D.C. on January 26, 2007. I testified at the hearing, presenting this Article\nas my testimony. 72\nIII. The CVRA's Right to Fairness Requires Comprehensive Changes to Protect Victims\nThe CVRA requires fundamental changes in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The CVRA makes crime victims\nparticipants in the criminal justice process and commands in sweeping terms that the courts must treat victims \"with fairness\nand with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\" 73 To faithfully implement that directive, it is necessary to assess each of\nthe existing rules against a fairness standard and then make changes and additions where the Rules do not guarantee fair\ntreatment to victims.\nThe Advisory Committee has made some useful progress in that direction. It should be commended for the careful drafting of\nits proposed changes and the thoroughness with which it explored the topic. Moreover, it is the nature of articles such as this\none to highlight points of disagreement rather than points of agreement. The Advisory Committee has seen fit to adopt several\nof the proposals that I recommended, 74 a fact that should not be overlooked.\nUnfortunately, the Advisory Committee acted timidly. Instead of reviewing all the Rules to determine whether they treated\nvictims fairly, the Advisory Committee decided it would not venture beyond parroting specifically described rights in the\nCVRA. The committee's reporter, well-regarded Duke law professor Sara Sun Beale, articulated the Advisory Committee's\ndrafting technique as simply incorporating rights created by Congress:\nThe most basic decision was how far beyond the statutory provisions the rules should go at this time. Although the CVRA\nenumerates a number of specific rights, it also contains general language stating that victims have a \"right to be treated with\nfairness.\" Judge Cassell advocates using this general right to fairness as a springboard for a variety of victim rights not\notherwise provided for in the CVRA.\n[We] concluded that the rules should incorporate, but not go beyond, the specific statutory provisions. The CVRA reflects a\ncareful Congressional balance between the rights of the defendant, the discretion afforded to prosecution, and the new rights\nafforded to victims. In light of this careful statutory balance, [we] felt that it would not be appropriate to create new victim\nrights not based upon the statute. Rather, [we] [*873] sought to incorporate the rights Congress did afford into the rules. In so\ndoing, [we] attempted, to the degree possible, to use the statutory language. [We] anticipate[] that the courts will develop the\n68\nJudicial Conference of the United States, Minutes of the Advisory Committee on the Rules of Criminal Procedure (Oct. 24-25, 2005),\navailable at http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/Minutes/CR10-2005-min.pdf [hereinafter Advisory Committee Minutes].\n69\nJudicial Conference of the United States, Report of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules (Dec. 8, 2005), available at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/rules/Reports/CR12-2005.pdf [hereinafter Advisory Committee Report].\n70\nId. at 2.\n71\nCommittee on Rules of Practice & Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Preliminary Draft of Proposed Amendments\nto the Federal Rules of Appellate, Bankruptcy, Civil and Criminal Procedure (Aug. 2006), www.uscourts.gov/ rules/newrules1.html\n[hereinafter Proposed Amendments] (last visted Dec. 30, 2007).\n72\nAll testimony and other comments about the proposed changes can be found at www.uscourts.gov/rules/Proposed0206-1.htm.\n73\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8) (2006) (emphasis added).\n74\nSee, e.g., infra notes 96-97 and accompanying text (discussing amendment to Rule 18).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L.

Regardless of how the CVRA's language on fairness is interpreted, should we really debate treating crime victims fairly?\nPresumably the general public expects the nation's criminal rules to be fair to all concerned - the government, defendants, and\nvictims. Reflecting that view, for the last twenty years Congress has passed a series of laws extending rights to crime victims.\n76 Even without a single word in the CVRA mentioning fairness, the Advisory Committee should carefully review the existing\nrules to ensure fairness for victims.\nIn any event, Congress has spoken. The Advisory Committee's general approach does not faithfully implement the\ncongressional command of fair treatment, as the following sections demonstrate.\nA. The CVRA's Text and Legislative History Create a Substantive Right to Fairness\nTurning to the Advisory Committee's specific justifications for not implementing the right to fairness, perhaps its most striking\nclaim is that the right is merely some sort of a \"springboard\" for other specific rights. The Advisory Committee declines to\nimplement this right because this would \"go beyond … the specific statutory provisions\" in the CVRA. 77 But the right to\nfairness is itself one of the specific provisions in the CVRA. The CVRA grants victims the following rights:\n1. The right to be reasonably protected from the accused\n2. The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the\ncrime or of any release or escape of the accused\n3. The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing\nevidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that\nproceeding\n[*874] 4. The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or\nany parole proceeding\n5. The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case\n6. The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law\n7. The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay\n8. The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy 78\nAs in the various state victims' bills of rights, 79 the fairness right is not mere hortatory language. The CVRA introduced these\nrights in the statute with the introductory clause: \"A crime victim has the following rights … .\" 80 Thus, the right to fairness is\n75\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 1-2. The Advisory Committee largely adopted the recommendation of the subcommittee.\nTo simplify this Article, I will generally ascribe the views of the subcommittee to the Advisory Committee.\n76\nSee supra notes 14-20 and accompanying text.\n77\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 1.\n78\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a) (2006) (emphasis added).\n79\nSee, e.g., Alaska Const. art. I, § 24 (victim's right \"to be treated with dignity, respect, and fairness during all phases of the criminal and\njuvenile justice process\"); Ariz. Const. art. II, § 2.1(A)(1) (victim's right \"to be treated with fairness, respect, and dignity\"); Idaho Const. art.\nI, § 22(1) (victim's right \"to be treated with fairness, respect, dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process\"); Ill.

I, § 24(1) (victim's right \"to be treated\nwith fairness and respect for their dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process\"); N.J. Const. art. I, § 22 (victim's right to \"be\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *874\nPage 10 of 78\nto be given real world application. To be sure, it is a broad right - akin to the defendant's broad right to \"due process of law.\" 81\nBut to implement that right in the criminal rules is not \"creating new victims rights not based upon the statute,\" as the Advisory\nCommittee puts it, but simply implementing a clearly articulated congressional command.\nIt is a \"cardinal principle of statutory construction\" that effect must be given to every word in a statute. 82 Under the Advisory\nCommittee's approach, the congressional directive that crime victims be treated fairly will have no effect on [*875] any of the\nRules. The fairness directive will, in other words, be rendered mere surplusage - something that the Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly cautioned against. 83\nThe Advisory Committee also admits that it is interpreting the CVRA narrowly, contrary to the standard rule that remedial\nlegislation is to be construed broadly. 84\nIn addition, the Advisory Committee's approach flouts the declared intentions of the Act's drafters. There is no need to guess\nabout Congress's intent on the right of fairness. Senator Kyl, who cosponsored the CVRA with Senator Feinstein, explained\nquite directly that Congress meant for the right to have substantive content:\nThe broad rights articulated in this section [section 8, mandating victims be treated with fairness along with dignity and\nrespect] are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational. One of these rights is the right to be\ntreated with fairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. 85\nNor is there any doubt that Congress intended this command to reach the judiciary, including judicial branch components like\nthe Advisory Committee. Again, Senator Kyl specifically addressed this point:\nToo often victims of crime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system. This provision\n[section 8] is intended to direct government agencies and employees, whether they are in executive or judicial branches, to treat\nvictims of crime with the respect they deserve and to afford them due process. 86\nThe Advisory Committee's decision not to treat fairness as an enforceable right is so at odds with the CVRA's legislative\nhistory that one becomes curious as to why the Advisory Committee determined not to follow it. The Advisory Committee also\ndiverged from the legislative history in several other areas. 87 In reviewing the Advisory Committee's records, however,\nnotably absent is any mention of legislative intent. The Advisory Committee does not cite the statute's [*876] legislative\ntreated with fairness, compassion and respect by the criminal justice system\"); N.M. Const. art.

Rev. 861, *876\nPage 11 of 78\nhistory even once in a twenty-page subcommittee report, in four pages of minutes of its discussions, or in twenty-six pages of\nproposed amendments and accompanying Advisory Committee Notes. 88 Perhaps the Advisory Committee took a different\napproach than the CVRA's drafters because it did not consider their stated intentions.\nIf, on the other hand, the Advisory Committee was aware of the drafters' intentions and declined to follow them, it is staking\nout a rather unusual path. It is standard practice for the Advisory Committee, no less than courts, to look to legislative history in\ncrafting the Rules. 89 With respect to the CVRA in particular, many courts have found the CVRA's legislative history highly\ninstructive. They have good reason for relying on the history. Unlike some contentious pieces of legislation where legislators\npossessed divergent views, the CVRA enjoyed a \"broad, bi-partisan consensus.\" 90 It passed by a vote of 393 to 14 in the\nHouse 91 and by a voice vote in the Senate. 92 Moreover, the CVRA's cosponsors were bipartisan, and the views they gave on\nthe legislation were not contradicted by anyone else. Thus, as the Ninth Circuit has explained in construing the CVRA to track\nSenator Kyl's and Feinstein's views:\nFloor statements by the sponsors of the legislation are given considerably more weight than floor statements by other members,\nand they are given even more weight where, as here, other legislators did not offer any contrary views. Silence, the maxim\ngoes, connotes assent, and so we can draw from the fact that no one registered disagreement with Senators Kyl and Feinstein on\nthis point the reasonable inference that the views they expressed reflected a consensus, at least in the Senate. 93\nIn light of all this, it is beyond doubt that crime victims have a substantive right to be treated with fairness (as well as with\nrespect for their dignity and [*877] privacy) in the federal criminal justice process. Once that right is in mind, the Advisory\nCommittee has clear duties under the Rules Enabling Act. That Act provides that the Rules \"shall not abridge, enlarge or\nmodify any substantive right.\" 94 Therefore, if any existing rule of criminal procedure \"abridges\" or even \"modifies\" a victim's\nrights to fairness, it is invalid and must be changed. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee must review all the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure to ensure that they protect victims' right to fairness.\nB. The Advisory Committee Treats the Right to Fairness Inconsistently\nThe Advisory Committee claimed that to implement the right to fairness would use the right as \"a springboard for a variety of\nvictim rights not otherwise provided for in the CVRA.\" 95 If so, the Advisory Committee was unable to consistently follow its\nown view. The Advisory Committee agreed with my proposed change to Rule 18; that change required that when a court\ndetermines where within a judicial district to hold a trial, it should consider not only the convenience of the defendant and the\n88\nSee Advisory Committee Report, supra note 69, at 1-20; Advisory Committee Minutes, supra note 68, at 13-16; Proposed Amendments,\nsupra note 71, at 349-75.\n89\nSee, e.g., Fed.

Rev. 861, *877\nPage 12 of 78\nwitnesses, but also the victim as well. 96 Notably, the Advisory Committee's rationale for this change was to \"implement[] the\nvictim's \"right to be treated with fairness' under the Crime Victims' Rights Act.\" 97 But if a change to the relatively obscure\nRule 18 is appropriate in light of the victim's right to fairness, why aren't changes to many other, more significant rules also\nappropriate?\nFurther highlighting the inconsistent treatment of the right to fairness is the way the Advisory Committee handled parallel\nprovisions in the CVRA. In a single clause, the CVRA gives victims the right to be treated not only with fairness, but also with\ndignity and respect: section (a)(8) of the CVRA provides that victims shall enjoy \"the right to be treated with fairness and with\nrespect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\" 98 The Advisory Committee used victims' rights to dignity and respect as a\n\"springboard\" in several places. For example, the Advisory Committee proposed an amendment to prevent inappropriate\nsubpoenas for personal or confidential information about a victim, explaining that \"this amendment implements the Crime\nVictims Rights Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), which states that victims have a right to respect for their \"dignity and\nprivacy.'\" 99 Similarly, the Advisory Committee proposed an amendment to prevent the inappropriate release of a victim's\naddress and telephone number as part of alibi defense disclosures, explaining that \"this amendment implements the victims'\nrights under the Crime Victims Rights Act … to be treated with respect for the [*878] victim's dignity and privacy.\" 100 Why\nthe Advisory Committee believed it appropriate to try to implement the \"dignity and privacy\" provisions of the CVRA but not\nthe immediately adjacent \"fairness\" provision is unclear.\nC. The Advisory Committee Should Not Leave the CVRA's Interpretation to the Litigation Process.\nThe Advisory Committee also justified its decision not to review the Rules for fairness on the ground that it would \"not\nattempt to use the rules to anticipate and resolve the interpretative questions that will arise\" under the CVRA. 101 Yet a basic\npurpose - perhaps the basic purpose - behind the procedural rules is to lay out answers to questions that might otherwise have to\nbe litigated. To that end, Rule 2 of the criminal rules provides that \"these rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just\ndetermination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in procedure and fairness in administration, and to eliminate\nunjustifiable expense and delay.\" 102 It is at odds with securing simplicity in procedure to simply regurgitate the language of\nthe CVRA in the criminal rules, leaving every interpretative question to the vagaries of litigation.\nHistorical examples are legion of the Advisory Committee amending the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure precisely to\nresolve questions that were being (or might have been) litigated. To provide a few straightforward examples, in 1979 the\nAdvisory Committee amended and clarified the standards for presentence withdrawal of a guilty plea. The Advisory Committee\nnoted that courts had \"critically stated that the Rule offers little guidance as to the applicable standard for a presentence\nwithdrawal of plea and that as a result the contours of [the presentence] standard [in the rule] are not easily defined.\" 103 The\namendment clarified language \"which has been a cause of unnecessary confusion.\" 104\n96\nSee Advisory Committee Report, supra note 69, at 8 (adopting proposal from Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra, note 4, at 878-79).\n97\nId. at 4; accord CVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 8.\n98\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8).\n99\nAdvisory Committee Report, supra note 69, at 3 (note to Proposed Rule 17(c)(3)).\n100\nId. at 351.\n101\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 2.\n102\nFed.

Rev. 861, *878\nPage 13 of 78\nIn 1983, the Advisory Committee changed Rule 11(a)(2) to eliminate a split of authority on conditional guilty pleas. One of the\nreasons for the change was to \"produce much needed uniformity in the federal system on this matter.\" 105\nIn 1994, the Advisory Committee amended rule 32(b)(2) to give defense counsel an opportunity to be present when probation\nofficers interviewed their clients while preparing a presentence report. 106 The Advisory Committee Notes explained that while\nthere was no constitutional right to counsel at this point in the process, caselaw in two circuits suggested that requests of\ncounsel to be present should be honored as a matter of prudence. 107 What is particularly interesting about [*879] this\nexample is that the Advisory Committee stepped in to protect the legitimate interests of defendants even in the absence of a\nconstitutional or statutory command to do so. Of course, the CVRA creates a statutory command to the Advisory Committee to\nprotect victims' interests.\nIn 2002, the Advisory Committee amended Rule 51 to provide that court rulings admitting or excluding evidence were\ngoverned by the Federal Rules of Evidence. The reason was to avoid \"the possibility that an argument might have been made\"\nthat an earlier congressional action conflicted with the rules of evidence. 108 In other words, the Advisory Committee simply\nanticipated and resolved an interpretive question that might otherwise have arisen.\nIn 2005, the Advisory Committee amended Rule 12.2 to provide sanctions for a party's failure to disclose certain alibi\ninformation. 109 The reason for the change was to \"fill[] a gap\" in the Rules. 110\nIn these instances, the Advisory Committee stepped in to avoid unnecessary litigation and to clarify the application of the\nRules. Not only is this the Advisory Committee's standard approach, but there are particularly strong reasons for not leaving\nclarification of crime victims' rules to case-by-case litigation. The most significant problem is that such litigation will occur\nonly in fits and starts. Unlike the government and criminal defendants who always have legal representation, crime victims\nhave no right to appointed counsel and are often indigent or otherwise unable to afford to hire an attorney. 111 As a result, in\nmany cases it is an empty gesture to promise victims that they can litigate application of the Rules. As a practical matter, they\nwill often be unable to do so. 112 Indeed, the Advisory Committee seemingly compounds this problem by declining to put into\nthe Rules any restatement of courts' discretionary authority to appoint counsel for crime victims. 113\nEven in cases where victims can afford counsel to defend their legal rights, the kind of litigation that the Advisory Committee\nenvisions will be unenlightening and formalistic. For instance, while I have proposed including a specific provision in the Rule\n11 guilty plea colloquy requiring that the court address a victim before accepting a plea, 114 the Advisory Committee has not\nrecommended any change. This failure could well spawn litigation about the victims' role in the plea process that will require\ncourts to consider why Rule 11 fails to mention crime victims and how this failure interplays with the CVRA's commands on\n105\nFed.

See, e.g., Kenna v. U.S. Dist.\nCourt for the Cent. Dist. of Cal., 435 F.3d 1011, 1018 (9th Cir. 2006) (victims' assertion of right affirmed; government does not take a\nposition on the claim).\n113\nSee infra notes 449-463 and accompanying text (discussing proposed rule 44.1).\n114\nSee infra notes 145-152 and accompanying text.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *879\nPage 14 of 78\nvictims' rights in the [*880] plea process. Because the CVRA guarantees victims a right in the plea process, its dictates will\nultimately govern. But only the Advisory Committee can pretermit such needless litigation about how to interpret its rules. In\nshort, it would be much simpler for all concerned if Rule 11 - and, indeed, all the other rules - were redrafted to simply fold\nvictims in at the appropriate point in the process.\nFinally, one of the overriding goals of the CVRA is to dramatically reform the entire approach of the federal criminal justice\nsystem. As Senator Feinstein explained \"this legislation is meant to correct, not continue, the legacy of the poor treatment of\ncrime victims in the criminal process.\" 115 And Senator Kyl added, \"[a] central reason for these rights is to force a change in a\ncriminal justice culture which has failed to focus on the legitimate interests of crime victims … .\" 116 Given Congress's clear\nintent to change a hostile legal culture, it makes no sense to leave victims to the mercies of litigation to determine the scope of\ntheir rights.\nFor all these reasons, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be amended not only to implement the narrow rights\narticulated in the CVRA but also its more open-ended rights, particularly the victim's right to be treated with fairness.\nIV. Specific Rule Changes to Comply with the CVRA\nAgainst the backdrop of the statutory command that victims should be treated with fairness, the balance of this Article will\ncompare my specific proposals for amending the Rules with those of the Advisory Committee - attempting to show the strong\npoints of my ideas. For convenience, the Article proceeds sequentially through the Rules from beginning to end, relying in the\ncase of proposed amendments on the Advisory Committee's numbering.\nRule 1 - Definition of \"Victim\" and \"Victim's Representative\" The Proposals:\nI proposed amending Rule 1 to include a definition of victim and the victim's representatives as follows:\n\"Victim\" means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in the\nDistrict of Columbia. In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the\nlegal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victim's estate, family members, or any other persons\nappointed as suitable by the court, may [*881] assume the crime victim's rights under these rules, but in no event shall the\ndefendant be named as such guardian or representative. 117\nThe Advisory Committee instead proposed to cross-reference the statutory definition of \"crime victim\" as follows:\n\"Victim\" means a \"crime victim\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(e). A person accused of an offense is not a victim of that\noffense. 118\nDiscussion:\nThe rules should be amended to make clear that both a victim and the victim's representative can assert the victim's rights. As\nan effort in that direction, I proposed amending Rule 1 to include a definition of \"victim\" as well as a definition of \"victim's\nlawful representative.\" 119 My definitions were lifted from the CVRA. 120 In response, the Advisory Committee agreed to\ninclude a definition of \"victim\" but left to an Advisory Committee Note the reference to the victim's representative. 121\n115\n150 Cong.

Rev. 861, *881\nPage 15 of 78\nThe differences between the two approaches might seem modest until one recognizes that another provision in the Advisory\nCommittee's proposals appears to intentionally omit any reference to a victim representative. Proposed Rule 60, the Advisory\nCommittee's \"global\" provision dealing with victims' rights, explains who may enforce victims' rights. 122 In clear contrast to\nthe CVRA's governing provision, this proposed rule omits any reference to a crime victim's representative. Proposed Rule 60\nprovides only that \"the rights of a victim under these rules may be asserted by the victim and the attorney for the government.\"\n123 In contrast, the CVRA enforcement provision states: \"The crime victim or the crime victim's lawful representative, and the\nattorney for the Government may assert the rights described in subsection (a).\" 124 Nothing in the Advisory Committee Notes\nindicates that a crime victim's representative is among those authorized to assert the rights. The Advisory Committee also\nstruck existing [*882] language in the Rules about a victim's representative exercising the victim's right to speak at\nsentencing. 125\nThe repeated omission of any reference to a victim's representative is unsettling given the Advisory Committee's promise to\nsimply track the CVRA's language. 126 Its failure to track the language here leaves the impression that the Advisory Committee\nis uncomfortable with a victim's representative asserting rights. Perhaps the Committee could make a policy argument against\nsuch representation, but Congress has said victims have the right to have representatives speak for them. The Federal Rules\nshould follow the CVRA and state clearly that a victim's representative can assert a victim's rights.\nThe need for clarity on this point is heightened by pre-CVRA caselaw questioning any right by a victim's representative to\nassert victims' rights. Most notably, in one of the Oklahoma City bombing prosecutions, the Tenth Circuit rebuked a trial judge\nfor permitting an attorney for the bombing victims to participate in oral argument at a sentencing hearing. 127 The Circuit\nstated that \"in the absence of any authority permitting the participation of victims' counsel, we harbor concerns about the\npropriety of the district court's rulings.\" 128 This statement can no longer be regarded as good law in light of the CVRA's\ncommands. 129\nAnother reason for clarity is to make sure that corporate and organizational victims are able to be heard in the process. The\nCVRA's definition of victim - \"a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense\"\n130 - is essentially lifted from federal restitution statutes. 131 Federal courts have consistently held that a \"person\" entitled to\nrestitution includes corporate entities. 132 Of course, such legal entities cannot appear personally but only through [*883] a\n121\nFor subsequent developments on this issue, see infra notes 578-579 and accompanying text.\n122\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60, at 16-18.\n123\nAdvisory Committee Report, supra note 69, at 16.\n124\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(1) (2006) (emphasis added).\n125\nSee Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 32(i)(4)(B)(i)-(ii), at 13-14 (deleting language confirming permission for parent or legal\nguardian to exercise right to speak at sentencing for minor and incapacitated victims).\n126\nSee, e.g., Advisory Committee Report, supra note 69, at 1 (\"The Subcommittee concluded that the Rules should incorporate, but not go\nbeyond, the specific statutory provisions [in the CVRA].\").\n127\nUnited States v.

Rev. 861, *883\nPage 16 of 78\nrepresentative. To eliminate any doubt about the ability of corporate entities to assert their interests, the Rules should be\namended to clearly state that a victim's representative can enforce victims' rights. 133\nRule 2 - Fairness to Victims The Proposals:\nI proposed amending Rule 2 to require fairness to victims in construing the Rules as follows:\nThese rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in\nprocedure and fairness in administration to the government, defendants, and victims, and to eliminate unjustifiable expense and\ndelay. 134\nThe Advisory Committee did not propose amending Rule 2. 135\nDiscussion:\nTo assure that crime victims are treated fairly throughout the process, it makes sense to add language incorporating crime\nvictims in Rule 2 - the one rule that specifically mentions fairness. As discussed in the previous Part of this Article, the\nAdvisory Committee does not agree that the Rules should be amended to protect a victim's right to fairness and for this reason,\npresumably, declined to amend Rule 2. The qualifier \"presumably\" is needed here because the CVRA Subcommittee did not\ngive an explanation for declining to follow my recommendation here. 136\nThe fairness issues appears to be the fundamental difference between my approach and the Advisory Committee's approach -\nthe Rules are either going to treat crime victims fairly or not. As discussed in the previous Part of this Article, they should.\nBut even those who share my view on fairness might nonetheless argue that Rule 2 need not be amended because it is an\ninterpretive rule with no substantive effect. After all, it could be argued, the rule simply calls for a \"just determination\" of\ncriminal cases, arguably a symbolic command. And, in any event, that command might be flexible enough to encompass crime\nvictims.\n[*884] The debate about how Rule 2 ought to read is, however, about more than symbols. In 1946, the initial chairman of the\nAdvisory Committee called Rule 2 \"the most important rule of the whole set.\" 137 Rule 2 has been cited by a number of courts,\n138 including the Supreme Court. 139 Rule 2 has consequences. Not only does it \"set[] forth a principle of interpretation\" for\njudge could not require the wrongdoers to pay restitution … .\"); United States v.

Lincoln, 277 F.3d 1112, 1113-14 (9th Cir. 2002) (discussing\n18 U.S.C. § 3664, which specifically recognizes the United States as a possible victim for restitution purposes).\n133\nThe National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has proposed adding a \"factfinding\" hearing for determining who qualifies as a\nvictim under the CVRA.

For example, in United States v. Broadus, the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia used Rule 2 as a basis for deviating from the time limits imposed by Rule 29(c) for\nthe defendant to seek a new trial. 141 Relying on Rule 2, the court determined that \"a seemingly plausible inference from a\ncriminal rule cannot command blind adherence if it would deprive an accused person … of a just determination of his or her\ncause.\" 142 Using Rule 2 to protect defendants' legitimate interests seems entirely proper. But crime victims need the same\ntextual support to secure their legitimate interests.\nNot only is Rule 2 important, directly including crime victims in the language is important as well. Courts are used to resolving\ndisputes between prosecutors and defendants, not considering the interests of crime victims. 143 That problem is, indeed, the\nwhole reason for the passage of the CVRA. As Senator Feinstein has explained, \"In case after case we found victims and their\nfamilies were ignored, cast aside, and treated as non-participants in a critical event in their lives. They were kept in the dark by\n… judges focused on defendant's rights, and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them.\" 144 For all these\nreasons, Rule 2 should be amended to make clear that the Rules must be construed to be fair not only to the parties, but also to\nvictims.\n[*885] Rule 11(a)(3) - Victims' Views on Nolo Contendere Pleas The Proposals:\nI proposed requiring courts to consider a victim's view before accepting any nolo contendere plea as follows:\nNolo Contendere Plea. Before accepting a plea of nolo contendere, the court must consider the parties' and victims' views and\nthe public interest in the effective administration of justice. 145\nThe Advisory Committee proposed no change to the rule. 146\nDiscussion:\nIt is unclear why the Advisory Committee declined to change Rule 11 to require courts to consider victims' views on nolo\npleas. The CVRA Subcommittee purported to catalog and briefly discuss all of my proposals that the subcommittee declined to\nrecommend to the full Committee. Inexplicably, my Rule 11(a)(3) proposal (along with my other Rule 11 proposals) was not\nmentioned 147 and, thus, there is nothing in the available records to indicate that the Advisory Committee considered it.\nPossibly the reason the Advisory Committee did not recommend this change was simply oversight.\nPerhaps the Advisory Committee was relying on its \"global\" rule on victims' rights (Rule 60) which provides that \"the court\nmust permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning … [a] plea … involving\nthe crime.\" 148 But that rule deals solely with the subject of being \"heard.\" Once the court has heard the victim, the question\n140\nSee id. at 424-25 (referring to Fallen v.

Rev. 861, *885\nPage 18 of 78\nremains what the court should do with the victim's statement. Currently Rule 11(a)(3) specifies that the court must consider\n\"the parties'\" views on a nolo plea - but it makes no mention of the victim's views. 149 The CVRA now mandates that victims\nmust be \"reasonably heard\" at any proceeding involving a \"plea.\" 150 It is hard to see how anyone could argue that a victim is\nreasonably heard when, after making a [*886] statement about the nolo plea, the court is not required to even consider it. The\nrule should be amended to require courts to consider victims' statements.\nRule 11(b)(4) - Victims' Right To Be Heard on Pleas\nThe Proposals:\nI proposed that the court should be required to address any victim present when a plea is taken to determine whether the victim\nwishes to make a statement and to consider the victim's view before accepting a plea, as follows:\nVictims' Views. Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or allows any plea to be withdrawn, the court must\naddress any victim who is present personally in open court. During this address, the court must determine whether the victim\nwishes to present views regarding the proposed plea or withdrawal and, if so, what those views are. The court shall consider the\nvictim's views in acting on the proposed plea or withdrawal. 151\nThe Advisory Committee recommended no change to Rule 11. 152\nDiscussion:\nIt is hard to understand why the Advisory Committee declined to recommend changing Rule 11 to require that victims be\naddressed, as it did not discuss the idea. 153 If the Advisory Committee deliberately rejected this idea, it has given no\nexplanation and it is hard to see any justification for the Advisory Committee's position. The CVRA gives victims \"the right to\nbe reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving … [a] plea.\" 154 To implement the victim's right to\nbe heard regarding a plea, my proposed rule change merely required the court to directly address any victim who is present in\ncourt and to consider any views the victim expressed. This is consistent with the CVRA's legislative history which explains that\n\"this provision is intended to allow crime victims to directly address the court in person.\" 155 The language of the proposed\nrule is lifted from an earlier paragraph in Rule 11, which requires the court \"before accepting a plea of guilty\" to \"address the\ndefendant personally in open court.\" 156 Victims should be treated evenhandedly with defendants. It may also be important for\nthe judge to address victims directly because many victims will lack [*887] the assistance of counsel. Untrained in legal\nproceedings, victims may be uncertain about exactly when in the process they should present their views. Having the court\naddress the victim will eliminate that uncertainty and ensure that the victim's right to be heard is vindicated.\nThe Advisory Committee's \"global\" rule on victims' rights (Rule 60) does briefly address pleas. Tracking language in the\nCVRA, the Advisory Committee would require the court to \"permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding …\n149\nThe rule does mention that the court must consider \"the public interest in the effective administration of justice\" in reviewing a nolo plea.\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(3). But this broad phrase does not appear to encompass the views of particular actors regarding a plea, as made\nclear by the fact that the rule separately lists \"the parties' views\" as something the court must consider.\n150\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4) (2006).\n151\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 866.\n152\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n153\nSee supra note 145-147 and accompanying text (noting the absence of any mention of my Rule 11 proposals as those the subcommittee\nrejected).\n154\n18 U.S.C § 3771(a)(4).\n155\n150 Cong.

Rev. 861, *887\nPage 19 of 78\nconcerning … [a] plea.\" 157 But this brief mention in the rule is inferior to my specific proposal for several reasons. First, Rule\n11 is the \"script\" when federal judges accept guilty pleas. Victims should be directly included here so that judges do not\ninadvertently overlook victims' rights. Second, stating only that victims may be \"reasonably heard\" regarding a plea, without\nexplaining how that will occur, invites litigation and uncertainty. For example, is a victim reasonably heard when allowed to be\nheard only through written submission? 158 Is a victim treated \"fairly\" if the court is required to address the defendant in open\ncourt but not to address the victim? If the court does not address the victim, when should the victim try to interrupt the\nproceedings to be heard? Should the victim's views enter into the court's calculation about whether to accept the plea? All of\nthese questions are answered in a simple and straightforward way by my proposal - a proposal which the Advisory Committee\nshould adopt.\nRule 11(c)(1) - Prosecution To Consider Victims' Views on Pleas The Proposals:\nI proposed that the prosecution should be required to consider victims' views in developing any proposed plea arrangement as\nfollows:\n(1) In General. An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may\ndiscuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. The attorney for the government shall\nmake reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider the victims' views about, any proposed plea negotiations. If\nthe defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, [*888] the plea\nagreement may specify that an attorney for the government will … [listing various options]. 159\nThe Advisory Committee did not recommend any change. 160\nDiscussion:\nMy proposed change required prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify victims about pleas and to consider the victims'\nviews regarding pleas. This requirement was taken almost verbatim from the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance, which already directs prosecutors to \"make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider\nvictims' views about, prospective plea negotiations.\" 161 According to the Department of Justice, \"twenty-nine states [already]\nrequire prosecutors to \"consult with' or \"obtain the views of' victims at the plea agreement stage.\" 162\n157\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60(a)(3), at 15-16.\n158\nCompare United States v.

Supp. 2d 319, 333 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting in dicta that § 3771(a)(4) \"requires the victim to\nbe given an opportunity actually to be \"heard' rather than afforded some alternate means of communicating her views\") (emphasis in\noriginal), with United States v. Marcello, 370 F. Supp. 2d 745, 749 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (holding that \"in detention hearings, the victim's right to\nbe reasonably heard does not mandate oral statements, particularly when the [victim] has no personal knowledge of the guilt of the\ndefendant(s) and offers an opinion only on a matter that is not in dispute\").\n159\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 868.\n160\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n161\nU.S. Dep't of Justice, Office for Victims of Crime, Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance 30 (2005) (defining\nwhat can be considered in determining whether notice is reasonable in a particular case) [hereinafter Dep't of Justice, Attorney General\nGuidelines]; see also U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office for Victims of Crime, New Directions from the Field: Victims' Rights and Services for the\n21st Century 87 (1997) (\"Prosecutors should make every effort … to consult with the victim on the terms of any negotiated plea … .\")\n[hereinafter Dep't of Justice, New Directions from the Field].\n162\nDep't of Justice, New Directions from the Field, supra note 161, at 75 (quoting National Victims' Center, 1996 Victim's Rights\nSourcebook: A Compilation of Victim's Rights Laws, Arlington, VA: National Victim Center, 1997 § 5).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *888\nPage 20 of 78\nPerhaps the Advisory Committee overlooked this proposed change. 163 Yet it is important, implementing not only a victim's\nright to be heard at plea proceedings but also the rights to \"confer with the attorney for the government\" 164 and to be \"treated\nwith fairness.\" 165 Given that victims have the right to confer, the conferring should take place at the most salient points in the\nprocess. As Senator Feinstein explained, \"This right [to confer] is intended to be expansive. For example, the victim has the\nright to confer with the Government concerning any critical stage or disposition of the case.\" 166 Because the overwhelming\nmajority of federal criminal cases are resolved by a plea, a conference between the victim and the prosecutor regarding the plea\nwill be critical in most cases. Reflecting that fact, the Rules should follow the approach of the majority of states in directing\nprosecutors to consult with victims about pleas.\n[*889] Rule 11(c)(2) - Court to Be Advised of Victim Objections to Plea The Proposals:\nI proposed that prosecutors and victims' attorneys should be required to advise the court whenever they are aware that the\nvictim objects to a proposed plea agreement as follows:\n(2) Disclosing a Plea Agreement. The parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court when the plea is offered, unless\nthe court for good cause allows the parties to disclose the plea agreement in camera. When a plea is presented in open court, the\nattorney for the government or the attorney for any victim shall advise the court when the attorney is aware that the victim has\nany objection to the proposed plea agreement. 167\nThe Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. 168\nDiscussion:\nIn circumstances where an attorney, either for the government or for the victim, is aware of a victim's objection to a plea, that\ninformation should be relayed to the court. The victim's attorney will, no doubt, do this on her own initiative. The rule is\nintended to clarify that the prosecutor is under an equal obligation to communicate this information to the court.\nWhile the Advisory Committee may have overlooked this proposal, 169 the change is necessary because the CVRA implicitly\nobligates prosecutors to communicate a victim's objection to the court. The CVRA commands that prosecutors use their \"best\nefforts\" to enforce victims' rights. 170 Victims are often untrained in the law and unexpectedly thrust into criminal proceedings;\nthey may well believe that prosecutors automatically relay their objections to the plea to the court. The proposed rule avoids\nconfusion by requiring the prosecutor to notify the court of a victim's concern. The rule is limited to situations where the\nprosecutor is aware of an objection.\nThis approach is consistent with the leading case of State v. Casey, 171 which considered whether a victim's request to be heard\nregarding a plea made to the [*890] prosecutor was sufficient to trigger the victim's constitutional right to be heard. 172 In\n163\nSee supra note 147 and accompanying text (noting listing of Cassell proposals rejected; Rule 11 proposals not listed).\n164\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5) (2006).\n165\nId. § 3771(a)(8).\n166\n150 Cong.

Rev. 861, *890\nPage 21 of 78\nCasey, the victim told the prosecutor that she wished to be heard in opposition to a plea. The prosecutor refused to convey that\ninformation to the court and the trial judge accepted the plea. When the issue reached the Utah Supreme Court, the court\nconcluded that the prosecutor had an ethical obligation as an officer of the court to convey that information to the judge:\nProsecutors must convey such requests [to be heard] because they are obligated to alert the court when they know that the court\nlacks relevant information. This duty, which is incumbent upon all attorneys, is magnified for prosecutors because, as our case\nlaw has repeatedly noted, prosecutors have unique responsibilities… . The prosecutor is the representative not of an ordinary\nparty to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern\nat all; and whose interest … in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win … but that justice shall be done. 173\nApplying the reasoning of Casey to analogous rights in the CVRA, federal prosecutors must, as officers of the court, convey a\nvictim's request to be heard regarding a plea. Indeed, the prosecutor should convey not only that request to be heard but also the\nfact that the victim has an objection to the plea. In deciding whether to accept a plea, the court must consider the public interest.\n174 As the Courts of Appeals have explained, \"\"Rule 11 also contemplates the rejection of a negotiated plea when the district\ncourt believes that bargain is too lenient, or otherwise not in the public interest.'\" 175 When the prosecutor is aware of an\nobjection from a keenly interested member of the public - the victim - the court should not be left in the dark about it, as\nprovided in my proposed rule. 176\n[*891] Rules 12.1 and 12.3 - Victim Addresses and Phone Numbers Not Disclosed for Alibi and Public-Authority Defense\nPurposes The Proposals:\nRule 12.1 currently requires the government to disclose the address and telephone numbers of any witness, including any\nvictim, that it plans to use to disprove a defendant's alibi. I proposed amending Rule 12.1 to protect the victim's privacy, by\nexcluding their addresses and telephone numbers from this requirement as follows:\n(a) Government's Request for Notice and Defendant's Response.\n(1) Government's Request. An attorney for the government may request in writing that the defendant notify an attorney for the\ngovernment of any intended alibi defense.

The telephone number and address of an additional\nvictim witness must not be disclosed except as provided in (b)(1)(B).\n(d) Exceptions. For good cause, the court may grant an exception to any requirement of Rule 12.1(a)-(c). 181\nThe Advisory Committee also proposed adding an Advisory Committee Note as follows:\nSubdivisions (b) and (c). The amendment implements the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which states that victims have the right\nto be reasonably protected from the accused, and to be treated with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. See 18 U.S.C. §\n3771(a)(1) & (8). The rule provides that a victim's address and telephone number should not automatically be provided to the\ndefense when an alibi defense is raised. If a defendant establishes a need for this information, the court has discretion to order\nits disclosure or to fashion an alternative procedure that provides the defendant with the information necessary to prepare a\ndefense, but also protects the victim's interests. For example, the court might authorize the defendant and his counsel to meet\nwith the victim in a manner and place designated by the court, rather than giving the defendant the name and address of a\nvictim who fears retaliation if the defendant learns where he or she lives.\nIn the case of victims who will testify concerning an alibi claim, the same procedures and standards apply to both the\nprosecutor's initial [*894] disclosure and the prosecutor's continuing duty to disclose under subdivision (c). 182\nDiscussion:\nThe Advisory Committee agrees with me that the current rule providing that a victim's address and telephone number be\nautomatically disclosed whenever an alibi is at stake conflicts with the CVRA. 183 This information can often be very sensitive\nfor a crime victim, as it could allow the defendant to find and harm a victim. The difference between our proposals is that I\nwould strike the requirement that a victim's address and telephone number be disclosed to the defense while the Advisory\nCommittee would add specific language allowing a court to order production of the address and telephone number based on a\ndefense showing of \"need.\" 184\nThe Advisory Committee's approach highlights an inconsistency in the way it handles defendants' and victims' interests. It has\nchosen to spell out in the Rules how a defendant can obtain access to a victim's address and telephone number. Of course, if the\nConstitution or a statute already requires the prosecutor to turn over that personal information, any rule is irrelevant.\nPresumably, the reason that the Advisory Committee added the language is because it knows that the language is not irrelevant\n- that is, that the Constitution and statute do not always require production of this information. 185 Obviously, nothing is wrong\nwith the Advisory Committee drafting rules that go beyond the Constitution and statutes to protect defendants' legitimate\ninterests. That approach is, indeed, commendable. What is wrong is for the Committee to work through its rules to make sure\n181\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 12.1, at 2-6 (footnote omitted).\n182\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 12.1, at 6 (footnote omitted).\n183\nCompare Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 872, with Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 12.1.\n184\nCompare Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 872-73, with Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 12.1(b)(1)(B), at 3-4\n(footnote omitted).\n185\nSee generally infra notes 297-324 and accompanying text (reviewing case law establishing that criminal defendants lack any relevant\nconstitutional or statutory right to discovery).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *894\nPage 24 of 78\ndefendants are treated fairly - even in the absence of an overarching statutory command to that effect - while not doing the\nsame for crime victims, even where the CVRA directly commands that victims be treated \"with fairness.\" 186\nIn any event, the Advisory Committee's proposal is decidedly unfair. The Committee proposes a two-pronged approach:\nIf the government intends to rely on a victim's testimony to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the alleged\noffense and the defendant establishes a need for the victim's address and telephone number, the court may:\n[*895] (i) order the government to provide the information in writing to the defendant or the defendant's attorney; or\n(ii) fashion a reasonable procedure that allows the preparation of the defense and also protects the victim's interests. 187\nNotice that the court can order disclosure of the victim's address upon a mere showing by the defendant of \"a need,\" by\nproceeding under subparagraph (i) of the proposed rule; the requirement to protect the victim's interests is triggered only if the\ncourt chooses to proceed under paragraph (ii). And the proposed rule fails to give any guidance on when the court should\nproceed under paragraph (ii) as opposed to paragraph (i).\nThe Advisory Committee's provision for two ways in which the court can avoid the requirements of withholding a victim's\nname seems unnecessary. Subsection (d) of Rule 12.1 already allows a court to grant an exception to any of the requirements of\nthe rule for \"good cause.\" 188 This exception has been used to justify the government's nondisclosure of its witnesses in\nsituations where their safety might be jeopardized. 189 There is, accordingly, no need to add \"wiggle room\" language in Rule\n12.1.\nMore important, the Advisory Committee's approach is fundamentally flawed. It makes no sense to require that the victim's\ninterests be considered only half the time - i.e., only where the court proceeds under paragraph (ii) but not under paragraph (i).\nMore important, since the Advisory Committee appears to agree that disclosing a victim's address raises obvious safety\nconcerns, allowing disclosure without any consideration of the victim's interests violates the CVRA's command that the victim\nmust be \"reasonably protected from the accused.\" 190 A court proceeding under paragraph (i) would be under no obligation to\n\"protect[] the victim's interests\" (as paragraph (ii) specifically provides), since it is a standard rule of construction that expressio\nunius est exclusio alterius (the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of the other). 191 At a bare minimum, the CVRA\nrequires redrafting the rule so that the court always considers victims' interests before it can order production of a victim's\naddress.\nAlso interesting are the choices that the Advisory Committee specifically lists for a judge. The options given are (i) \"order the\ngovernment to provide the information in writing\" or (ii) \"fashion a reasonable procedure that allows the preparation of the\ndefense and also protects the victim's interests.\" The listing of these two (and only these two) options seems to imply that the\ncourt does not have [*896] a third option - i.e., (iii) decline to order a victim's address be turned over. It is simply not the case\nthat every time the defendant can establish a \"need\" for information - no matter how trivial or how remotely connected to the\ncase - the court should either disclose a victim's address or fashion some other procedure toward the same end.\n186\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8) (2006).\n187\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 12.1(b)(1)(B), at 3-4 (footnote omitted).\n188\nFed.

Rev. 861, *896\nPage 25 of 78\nEven where the defendant can establish need, it may be the case that victims' safety interests will prevail. For example, in\nUnited States v. Wills, the district court allowed the government to delay the disclosure of the name of a witness because the\nwitness feared for her safety and the defendant had a violent history. 192 On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the defendant sought\nreversal of his conviction, arguing that \"the district court abused its discretion in finding good cause to permit the government\nto withhold [the witness] from its alibi rebuttal list and witness list.\" 193 Before his trial, Wills had provided the government\nwith the name of one alibi witness. In response, the government filed a sealed, ex parte application under Rule 12.1(e) seeking\nan exception to its obligation to disclose its alibi rebuttal witness to the defense. 194 Based on the defendant's violent history\nand apparent ability to \"induce others to commit crimes on his behalf,\" the court allowed the government to delay the\ndisclosure of the witness. 195\nThe Wills court noted that two other circuits had addressed or commented on the issue. The Sixth Circuit, in United States v.\nCausey, held that good cause existed to justify the nondisclosure of a witness to the defense. 196 The Causey court found\nevidence in the record indicating that witnesses were being threatened in an attempt to prevent them from testifying. 197 \"In\nsuch a situation, the physical safety and protection of potential witnesses constitutes a proper consideration of a trial court in\ndetermining whether good cause exists to justify nondisclosure of witnesses to opposing counsel and thus noncompliance with\nRule 12.1.\" 198 Similarly, in United States v. Elizondo, the Seventh Circuit cited Causey for the proposition that the protection\nof potential witnesses could justify postponing disclosure. 199 Following the reasoning of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits, Wills\nheld that the \"district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that good cause existed to authorize the Government to delay\ndisclosure of [the witness's] identity.\" 200\nThe Advisory Committee might respond to these criticisms of its proposal by pointing to discretionary language; the proposed\nrule states that the court \"may\" order production of the evidence or the fashioning of an alternative procedure. But given the\nobvious safety concerns that attend disclosure of the victim's home [*897] address to the defense, the Advisory Committee\nshould exercise extreme caution. More important, courts have no discretion to ignore the commands of the CVRA. Courts must\nalways protect a victim's right \"to be reasonably protected from the accused.\" 201 The proposed rule does not faithfully\nimplement that instruction. Indeed, the safety problems attendant to the Advisory Committee's proposal are heightened by fact\nthat disclosure is authorized to \"the defendant or the defendant's attorney.\" It does not take a great deal of imagination to\nforesee problems arising from telling criminal defendants where the victims who will testify against them live. In fairness to the\nAdvisory Committee, it was only tracking language used elsewhere in Rule 12. 202 All of Rule 12 should be redrafted to\nrequire disclosure only to defense counsel, rather than to the defendant personally. 203\n192\n88 F.3d 704, 710 (9th Cir. 1996).\n193\nId. at 708 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n194\nId. at 709.\n195\nId. at 710.\n196\n834 F.2d 1277, 1281 (6th Cir. 1987)\n197\nId. at 1282.\n198\nId.\n199\n920 F.2d 1308, 1314 (7th Cir. 1990).\n200\n88 F.3d at 710.\n201\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(1) (2006).\n202\nSee, e.g., Fed.

Rev. 861, *897\nPage 26 of 78\nThis may be a convenient place to highlight another defect in the Advisory Committee's proposal - crime victims have no right\nto be heard on whether their address should be given to the defendant. As discussed shortly, 204 I had originally proposed\nallowing victims to be heard \"on any matter directly affecting a victim's right\" - for example, whether disclosing a victim's\nhome address violates the victim's right to reasonable protection. The Advisory Committee waters down that proposal,\nrecommending only that the victim must \"be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning release,\nplea, or sentencing involving the crime.\" 205 Under the Advisory Committee's formulation, therefore, crime victims would\nseem to have no right to be heard on disclosure of their address. This is not a matter concerning \"release, plea, or sentencing\"\nand, in many cases, this issue will be decided by written pleadings rather than in a \"public proceeding.\" Nothing better\nillustrates the unfairness of the Advisory Committee's proposals and their illegality under the CVRA than its refusal to\nguarantee that crime victims will be heard on the subject of whether their home address will be turned over to the defendants\naccused of victimizing them.\nCompounding all these problems is one more: The Advisory Committee appears to encourage the use of crime victim\ndepositions or other face-to-face meetings between victims and defendants. In its proposed note to the amended rule, the\nAdvisory Committee describes as one possible procedure for dealing with a defense request for a victim's home address that\n\"the court might authorize the defendant and his counsel to meet with the victim in a manner and place designated by the court,\nrather than giving the defendant the name and address of victim.\" 206 This note raises a host of problems. Most importantly, a\nfederal court lacks jurisdiction to require a crime victim to appear at a face-to-face, pretrial [*898] meeting with the defendant.\nThe \"federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,\" 207 and federal judges have no general power to compel private citizens\nto meet with defendants before a trial. 208 Moreover, the Advisory Committee seems to envision that such orders could issue\nwithout the victim even being heard on the subject, a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. 209\nEven if the court had authority and had considered a victim's arguments, a face-to-face meeting with the defendant raises other\nproblems. Such a meeting is a deposition in all but name. Yet Rule 15 provides stringent limits on the circumstances in which a\ndefendant can depose a victim. In particular, any deposition is limited to \"exceptional circumstances\" and a deposition for\ndiscovery purposes is not permitted. 210 The Advisory Committee Note suggesting a meeting between a victim and a defendant\ndoes an end run around these limitations. 211\nIn light of all these concerns, the best approach is simply to strike the existing requirement that a victim's address and phone\nnumber be turned over as part of an alibi defense, as I proposed. It should also be noted that this proposal raises no due process\nconcerns that might stem from a one-sided reciprocal discovery rule. My proposal applies even handedly to both prosecution\nand the defense. Neither side is required to disclose the address or telephone number of a victim, thus complying with the\nSupreme Court's instruction that \"in the absence of a strong showing of state interests to the contrary, discovery must be a two-\n204\nSee infra notes 528-539 and accompanying text (discussing proposed Rule 60(a)(3)).\n205\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60, at 16.\n206\nId. at 6.\n207\nRasul v.

Rev. 861, *898\nPage 27 of 78\nway street.\" 212 In any event, protecting victims from serious harm is certainly a strong state interest that would justify any\nincidental effect on defense preparations for trial.\nFinally, however one ends up on the proper formulation of the address issue under Rule 12.1 (governing alibi defenses), the\nsame formulation ought to be used in Rule 12.3 (governing public-authority defenses). Although I made this recommendation\nin a previous article, 213 the Advisory Committee appears to have overlooked this parallel provision in need of amendment. So\nthat it is not overlooked again, I will set out the proposal in full. Tracking my recommendations for Rule 12.1, I recommended\na parallel amendment to Rule 12.3 as follows:\n[*899]\nRule 12.3 Notice of a Public-Authority Defense\n… .\n(4) Disclosing Witnesses.\n(A) Government's Request. An attorney for the government may request in writing that the defendant disclose the name,\naddress, and telephone number of each witness and the address and telephone number of each witness (other than the victim)\nthe defendant intends to rely on to establish a public-authority defense. An attorney for the government may serve the request\nwhen the government serves its response to the defendant's notice under Rule 12.3(a)(3), or later, but must serve the request no\nlater than 20 days before trial.\n(B) Defendant's Response. Within 7 days after receiving the government's request, the defendant must serve on an attorney for\nthe government a written statement of the name, address and telephone number of each witness. and the address and telephone\nnumber of each witness (other than the victim).\n(C) Government's Reply. Within 7 days after receiving the defendant's statement, an attorney for the government must serve on\nthe defendant or the defendant's attorney a written statement of the name, address, and telephone number of each witness, and\nthe address and telephone number of each witness (other than the victim), the government intends to rely on to oppose the\ndefendant's public-authority defense.\n(b) Continuing Duty to Disclose. Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to\nthe other party the name, address, and telephone number of any additional witness and the address and telephone number of\neach witness (other than the victim) if:\n(1) the disclosing party learns of the witness before or during trial; and\n(2) the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12.3(a)(4) if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier. 214\n[*900] Rule 15 - Victims' Right to Attend Pre-Trial Depositions The Proposals:\nI proposed amending Rule 15 to allow victims to attend any public depositions as follows:\n(i) Victims Can Attend. Victims can attend any public deposition taken under this rule under the same conditions as govern a\nvictim's attendance at trial. 215\n212\nWardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 475 (1973).\n213\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 873.\n214\nApparently in response to my argument, the Advisory Committee has just proposed an amendment to Rule 12.3 paralleling its\namendment to Rule 12.1. See infra notes 585-587 and accompanying text.\n215\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 874.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *900\nPage 28 of 78\nThe Advisory Committee did not propose any change to Rule 15. 216\nDiscussion:\nRule 15 authorizes depositions for the purpose of preserving evidence for trial, 217 thus, such depositions are an extension of\nthe trial. Victims, accordingly, have the right to attend such proceedings, if they are public, 218 under the same conditions\ngoverning their attendance at trial. To avoid any confusion over this issue, the proposed rule change directly states that fact.\nThe Advisory Committee declined to adopt this recommendation, concluding that depositions \"do not fall within the CVRA,\nwhich refers only to the victim's right not to be excluded from \"public court proceedings.'\" 219 But here, again, the Committee\nhas taken too narrow a view of the CVRA. It is simply unfair to victims to exclude them from a deposition in a criminal case -\nand, thus, a violation of the CVRA's command that victims be treated with fairness.\nThe simplest proof of this conclusion is to consider the rights of criminal defendants at depositions. Rule 15 directly guarantees\ncriminal defendants a right to attend a deposition. 220 Originally the rule was silent on a defendant's presence, but in the 1975\nenactment of the rule, 221 a defendant was guaranteed the right to attend. 222 Presumably, a major reason the Advisory\nCommittee added this language [*901] was to ensure fairness to defendants. 223 Indeed, after an indictment, \"Rule 15\ndepositions might constitute a \"critical stage' in a prosecution - requiring the presence of counsel - because of the potential\nconsequences of such depositions at trial.\" 224 Just as the Advisory Committee acted in 1975 to ensure defendants were treated\nfairly at criminal depositions, it should now do the same for victims.\nVictims also deserve the right to attend pretrial depositions because they are now participants in the criminal justice process. As\nthe Fifth Circuit explained in reversing a trial court which had allowed an ex parte deposition, \"depositions are never ordered\nwhere one party to the suit can be present, ask the questions, and hear the answers, and the opposing party in the case is not\nonly prevented from being present and asking questions, but is also denied even the opportunity to know what the questions\nand answers are.\" 225 The Fifth Circuit further noted that \"such a procedure is not only wholly unauthorized, it is contrary to\nthe most basic presuppositions of our adversary system of litigation.\" 226 Because a crime victim is now \"an independent\n216\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n217\nSee, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 69 F.3d 419, 437 (10th Cir. 1994).\n218\nCf. United States v. L.M., 425 F. Supp. 2d 948, 957 (N.D. Iowa 2006) (finding juvenile proceedings to be covered by the CVRA only\ninsofar as they are public court proceedings).\n219\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 17 (emphasis in original) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(3)(2006)).\n220\nFed. R. Crim. P. 15(d)(1)-(2).\n221\nThe Advisory Committee recommended various changes to the rule in 1974, which Congress modified somewhat in 1975. See Wright,\nsupra note 210, § 241, at 7-8. The changes discussed in this Article were initiated by the Advisory Committee.\n222\nWright, supra note 210, § 244, at 37.\n223\nPart of the rationale may have also been to facilitate admission of the deposition testimony at trial, as a defendant has a right to confront\nadverse witnesses at trial. But the Confrontation Clause does not always guarantee defendants a right to attend a deposition, see, for example,\nUnited States v. Salim, 855 F.2d 944, 955 (2d Cir. 1988), so the defendant's right to attend the deposition must rest on a broader justification\nthan implementing constitutional requirements.\n224\nUnited States v. Hayes, 231 F.3d 663, 674 (9th Cir. 2000).\n225\nIn re United States, 878 F.2d 153, 157 (5th Cir. 1989) (emphasis in original).\n226\nId.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *901\nPage 29 of 78\nparticipant in the proceedings,\" 227 the same considerations demand that victims be able to attend a pretrial deposition. To be\nsure, crime victims (like other members of the public) will have the opportunity to hear deposition testimony when it is\nintroduced at trial. 228 But that may be a pale substitute for actually observing a witness testify in person. 229 Victims may\nalso be able to facilitate the truth-seeking process by watching witnesses at the deposition and alerting prosecutors or defense\nattorneys to any false statements that are being made. 230 Rule 15 should, therefore, be amended to ensure that crime victims\nhave a right to attend any deposition.\nRule 17 - Victims' Right to Notice of Subpoena of Confidential Information\nThe Proposals:\nI recommended amending Rule 17 to ensure that subpoenas to third parties seeking personal and confidential information about\ncrime victims would not be [*902] abused. Initially, I proposed requiring a court determination of relevance at trial and notice\nto a victim as follows:\nRule 17(h)(2) - Victim Information. After indictment, no record or document containing personal or confidential information\nabout a victim may be subpoenaed without a finding by the court that the information is relevant to trial and that compliance\nappears to be reasonable. If the court makes such a finding, notice shall then be given to the victim, through the attorney for the\ngovernment or for the victim, before the subpoena is served. On motion made promptly by the victim, the court may quash or\nmodify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. 231\nThe Advisory Committee proposed more limited protections for such information as follows:\nRule 17(c)(3) - Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About Victim. After a complaint, indictment, or information\nis filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may not be served on a third\nparty without a court order, which may be granted ex parte. Before entering the order, the court may require that notice be\ngiven to the victim so that the victim has an opportunity to move to quash or modify the subpoena. 232\nThe Advisory Committee also proposed the following note to accompany the rule change:\nSubdivision(c)(3). This amendment implements the Crime Victims' Rights Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), which\nstates that victims have a right to respect for their \"dignity and privacy.\" The rule provides a protective mechanism when the\ndefense subpoenas a third party to provide personal or confidential information about a victim. Third party subpoenas raise\nspecial concerns because a third party may not assert the victim's interests, and the victim may be unaware of the subpoena.\nAccordingly, the amendment requires judicial approval before service of a subpoena seeking personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim from a third party. The amendment also provides a mechanism for notifying the victim, and makes\nit clear that a victim may move to quash or modify the subpoena under Rule 17(c)(2) on the grounds that it is unreasonable or\noppressive.\nThe amendment applies only to subpoenas served after a complaint, indictment, or information has been filed. It has no\napplication to grand [*903] jury subpoenas. When the grand jury seeks the production of personal or confidential information,\ngrand jury secrecy affords substantial protection for the victim's privacy and dignity interests.\n227\n150 Cong.

Rev. 861, *903\nPage 30 of 78\nThe amendment seeks to protect the interests of the victim without unfair prejudice to the defense. It permits the defense to\nseek judicial approval of the subpoena ex parte, because requiring the defendant to make and support the request in an\nadversarial setting may force premature disclosure of defense strategy to the government. The court may approve or reject the\nsubpoena ex parte, or it may provide notice to the victim, who may then move to quash. In exercising its discretion, the court\nshould consider the relevance of the subpoenaed material to the defense, whether giving notice would prejudice the defense,\nand the degree to which the subpoenaed material implicates the privacy and dignity interests of the victim. 233\nHaving seen the Advisory Committee proposal and accompanying note, I am concerned that the limits on subpoenas found in\nthe United States Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Nixon 234 might be vitiated by a broad rule. To ensure courts\nconsistently apply Nixon's substantive and procedural standards to victim-related subpoenas, I am modifying my earlier\nproposal to require a court determination of specificity, relevance, and admissibility at trial, as well as notice to the victim, as\nfollows (new language italicized):\nRule 17(c)(3) - Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About Victim. After a complaint, indictment, or information\nis filed, no record or document containing personal or confidential information about a victim may be subpoenaed without a\nfinding by the court that the information is specifically described, relevant to and admissible at trial, and that compliance\nappears to be reasonable. If the court makes such a tentative finding, notice shall then be given to the victim, through the\nattorney for the government or for the victim, before the subpoena is served. On motion made promptly by the victim, the court\nmay quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive and may ask the court to revisit any\ntentative findings. A subpoena shall not be used for discovery purposes or to obtain information for impeachment at trial.\nDiscussion:\nThe issues involved in the Rule 17 amendments are complicated and very important. It is useful to divide the discussion into\nthree parts: (1) the problem the proposals address; (2) the procedural flaws in the Advisory Committee's proposal [*904]\nallowing ex parte subpoenas; and (3) the general lack of authority for subpoenas seeking crime victim information.\n(1) The Problem of Subpoenaing Confidential Victim Information\nThe existing rules governing subpoenas are flawed because they allow the parties to subpoena personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim from third parties without the victim knowing. This issue was highlighted recently in the notorious\nUtah state criminal proceedings involving the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart. 235 Attorneys for Elizabeth's alleged kidnapper\nsubpoenaed class records from her high school (class and teacher lists, report cards, and disciplinary and attendance records)\nand medical records from her hospital. 236 The school turned over the requested records without notice to the Smart family,\nwhile the hospital refused to turn over the requested records. When Elizabeth's father learned that her school records had been\nturned over to defense counsel, he filed a motion to have the records returned to the school. Prosecutors in the case also\nobjected that they were not given an opportunity to file a motion to quash prior to the production of the records. 237 The matter\nis apparently still under review in the state courts.\nThe problem that occurred in the Smart case under the Utah state rules could occur under the federal rules, as the attorney for\nElizabeth Smart pointed out to the Advisory Committee in a letter. 238 The federal rules currently permit an objection from the\n233\nId.\n234\n418 U.S. 683, 700-01 (1974).\n235\nSee generally Ed Smart & Lois Smart with Laura Morton, Bringing Elizabeth Home: A Journey of Faith and Hope (2003) (discussing the\nSmart Case).\n236\nStephen Hunt, Defense Blasted for Obtaining Smart's School Records, Salt Lake Trib., Jan. 14, 2005, at B2.\n237\nPat Reavy, Quash Smart Subpoenas, DA Says, Deseret Morning News, Feb. 1, 2005, at B3.\n238\nSee Letter from Gregory G.

Subpoenas without notice to victims also raise fairness\nconcerns, particularly if issues implicating the right of privacy are concerned. 248\n(2) Procedural Problems with the Advisory Committee Approach\nTo ensure protection of crime victims' rights when subpoenas for confidential information are issued, it is necessary to change\nthe federal rules. I proposed an amendment to guarantee notice to crime victims as well as a court determination that the\ninformation was relevant at trial before victims' personal and confidential information could be subpoenaed. The Advisory\nCommittee agreed that Rule 17 needed to be amended, but it proposed more limited protections for victims. The Committee\nwould require court approval before any subpoena issues to a third party seeking information about a victim. However, the\ncourt would have discretion about whether to give the victim an opportunity to be heard on the subpoena; and there are no\nsubstantive limits on the kinds of information that defendants can subpoena.\nTurning first to the procedural problems with the Advisory Committee proposal, the Committee would remit the entire issue of\nwhether to issue a subpoena for personal or confidential information (and, indeed, whether to even tell a victim about such a\nsubpoena) to the discretion of the court. The only protection the Advisory Committee offers is the requirement of a court order\n[*906] approving such a subpoena. The committee gives courts discretion to notify the victim or simply issue the subpoena ex\nparte.\n239\nFed. R. Crim.

Rev. 861, *906\nPage 32 of 78\nSubpoenas issued ex parte are plainly unfair to victims. When a victim's personal or confidential information is at stake, it is\ntruly hard to understand how anyone could argue that allowing it to be turned over to the defense without any opportunity to be\nheard treats victims \"fairly,\" as the CVRA requires.\nThe Advisory Committee does not clearly explain when a court should proceed ex parte and when it should follow the standard\npractice of giving notice to the victim as the affected party. The only justification the Advisory Committee gives for the\nextraordinary step of allowing ex parte procedures is to avoid forcing \"premature disclosure of defense strategy to the\ngovernment.\" 249 But when a victim's confidential information is at stake, some interest in concealing \"strategy\" from the\nopposing party can hardly be sufficient grounds for ex parte issuance of a subpoena. As the Supreme Court has bluntly\nexplained, our adversary system is not \"a poker game in which players enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their cards\nuntil played.\" 250\nAllowing ex parte procedures violates basic principles of fairness. The American Bar Association raised this point quite\neffectively in its comments to the Advisory Committee on Rule 17. 251 The ABA explained that Canon 3(B)(7) of the Model\nCode of Judicial Conduct provides in pertinent part that \"[a] judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in the\nproceedings, or that person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to law.\" 252 Rule 17 would allow that precept to be\nviolated by denying some victims a chance to heard before compromising their legal rights to confidentiality in personal and\nconfidential information. Similarly, the ABA noted that its Model Code of Judicial Conduct generally forbids courts from\nconsidering ex parte communications. 253 Rule 17, of course, flies in that face of that well-established prohibition. While the\nModel Code of Judicial Conduct is not binding on federal courts, its principles have generally been viewed as instructive. 254\nDefense attorneys would also be treading on ethical thin ice under proposed Rule 17. The Model Rules of Professional Conduct\nand the ABA Criminal Justice Standards both provide that \"in representing a client, a lawyer shall not … use methods of\nobtaining evidence that violates the legal rights of … a [third] [*907] person.\" 255 When defense attorneys obtain ex parte\nsubpoenas for a victim's confidential information, they may very well violate the rights of the victim, such as the right to\nconfidentiality preserved in the doctor-patient privilege or psychotherapist privilege.\nFor reasons such as these, the federal rape shield rule (among other examples) properly requires defendants to always provide\nnotice to the court - and to the victim - before seeking to introduce evidence about a rape victim's prior sexual history. 256 The\nrape shield rule does not create any exception for situations that might lead to disclosure of defense \"strategy.\" Rule 17 should\nfollow the same approach and insure that victims always have an opportunity to contest disclosure of their personal and\nconfidential information in court.\nAny defense interest in withholding strategy must give way to facially neutral rules. Both my proposed amendment and the\nAdvisory Committee's proposed amendment apply evenhandedly to both the prosecution and the defense. Thus, the\namendments are not designed to force disclosure of defense strategy, as they may also force disclosure of prosecution strategy\n249\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 17, at 8 (emphasis added).\n250\nWilliams v.

Rev. 861, *907\nPage 33 of 78\nif it is the prosecution who subpoenas confidential victim information. Due process is satisfied as long as the prosecution and\nthe defense have reciprocal rights and courts apply the Rules consistently. 257\nThe objectionable feature of the Advisory Committee proposal is that the subpoena could be issued without notice to a crime\nvictim. A narrower issue is whether certain pleadings could be filed on this question on an ex parte basis. Such ex parte filing\nmight be appropriate, in the sense that once the court gives notice that it is considering whether to issue a subpoena, then the\ndefendant, the government, or, indeed, the victim might wish to file parts of their pleadings under seal for good cause shown.\nRequests for such sealing could be handled in the ordinary course of litigation - once the victim knew that such litigation was\noccurring.\nEven if there is some tangential defense interest in conceding strategy, the Advisory Committee proposal addresses it in the\nmost haphazard way. Consider the Elizabeth Smart example mentioned earlier, in which the defense sent ex parte subpoenas to\nElizabeth's school and hospital. Under the Advisory Committee's proposal, a court could still decide to approve those\nsubpoenas ex parte to prevent disclosure of some secret defense \"strategy.\" But once the school and the hospital received the\nsubpoenas, nothing would bar them from revealing the subpoenas' existence to the victim - and, indeed, the world. Thus, the\ninterest the Advisory Committee purports to protect (concealing defense trial strategy) would actually be [*908] protected\nonly when the third party, for whatever reason, chose not reveal the subpoena. In the Smart case, for instance, the school did\nnot reveal the defense \"strategy\" 258 because it simply handed the materials over to the defense - in possible contravention of\nthe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 259 But the hospital refused to hand over Elizabeth's records and contacted the\nSmart family, which ultimately led to a public outcry over the subpoenas. There is no rhyme or reason to a procedure that is\nsupposed to protect defense strategy but that actually turns on the happenstance of whether third parties choose to notify crime\nvictims or the public about subpoenas they receive.\nThe haphazardness of the Advisory Committee's approach becomes even clearer when one realizes that defense \"strategy\" can\nbe protected only where the confidential information happens to rest in the hands of a third party rather than the victim herself.\nConsider, for example, a rape victim who has talked to a rape crisis counselor, who takes notes of the meeting. A defendant\nmight attempt to subpoena those notes from the counselor. 260 But if the counselor had previously transferred the notes back to\nthe rape victim, then the subpoena would have to be directed to the victim herself - and the victim could then move to quash the\nsubpoena. This is not some academic hypothetical, as rape counselors in Pennsylvania in the 1980s used precisely this\nprocedure to protect their clients against abusive defense subpoenas. 261 Moreover, rape counselors - and, indeed, most third\nparties involved in maintaining the personal and confidential information of victims - will probably have very strong incentives\n257\nSee Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 475-76 (1973); United States v. Bahamonde, 445 F.3d 1225, 1229 (9th Cir. 2006); Newman v.\nHopkins, 192 F.3d 1132, 1135 (8th Cir. 1999), vacated 529 U.S. 1084 (2000); United States ex rel. Veal v. DeRobertis, 693 F.2d 642, 646-\n47 (7th Cir. 1982). Indeed, such reciprocity may not even be required if \"significant governmental interests\" support its omission. See\nWardius, 412 U.S. at 476.\n258\nSuch as it was - apparently the only reason for the subpoenas was to try and dig up some dirt on the young kidnapping victim. See\nStephen Hunt, Defense Blasted for Obtaining Smart's School Records, Salt Lake Trib., Jan. 14, 2005, at B2.\n259\n20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b) (2006).\n260\nAs will be discussed shortly in the next Section of this Article, such a subpoena would likely be inappropriate for substantive reasons as\nwell. See supra Part IV, § 3.\n261\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court initially found that records held by rape counseling centers were subject to only limited protection from\ndefense subpoenas. See In re Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 428 A.2d 126, 132 (Pa. 1981). The results of that unfortunate decision were\nswift. Rape victims requested the return of their records from the center and, in some cases, even requested termination of the counseling\nrelationship. Commonwealth v. Wilson, 602 A.2d 1290, 1294 n.6 (Pa. 1992); Tera Jckowski Peterson, Comment, Distrust and Discovery: The\nImpending Debacle in Discovery of Rape Victims' Counseling Records in Utah, 2001 Utah L. Rev. 695; Beth Stouder, Note, Pennsylvania\nEstablishes New Privilege for Communications Made to a Rape Crisis Center Counselor - In re Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 55 Temp.\nL.Q. 1124, 1146 (1982). In light of this serious problem, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a new, absolute privilege protecting\ncommunications to rape crisis counselors from any disclosure without the consent of the victim. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5945.1(b) (2000)\n(upheld against constitutional attack in Wilson, 602 A.2d at 1297).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *908\nPage 34 of 78\nfor disclosing the fact of the subpoena to the victim, because of both ethical and legal considerations. 262 Thus, the Advisory\n[*909] Committee's use of ex parte procedures will only randomly protect defense strategy from disclosure.\nThe impossibility of truly ex parte procedures for Rule 17 subpoenas to third-parties has been recognized by several court\ndecisions. For example, in United States v. Urlacher, the defendant sought to use Rule 17 to subpoena financial, family, and\nemployment information concerning an individual believed by the defendant to be the government's main witness at trial. 263\nThe court declined to approve the subpoena ex parte, explaining that the custodian of the records \"has a Rule 17(c) motion to\nquash or modify, and one cannot easily imagine that such a motion should be heard and decided in secret … and hidden from\nthe opposing party and the public.\" 264 The court went on to explain the constitutional difficulties presented by such an\napproach, given that the First Amendment creates a general public right of access to court proceedings. 265\nEven if there is some arguable defense interest in not disclosing \"strategy,\" that interest must be subordinated to the compelling\nvictim interests that are at stake. My proposal (and the Advisory Committee's) applies to third-party subpoenas directed to the\nvictim's personal or confidential information. Congress has commanded that victims must not only be treated with \"fairness,\"\nbut also \"with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\" 266 Protecting dignity and privacy requires a hearing when\nconfidential information is at stake.\nThe Advisory Committee Note on its proposal does obliquely deal with this issue in a way that misstates the relevant legal\nlandscape. The Note accompanying the proposed Rule 17 amendment states vaguely that, \"in exercising its discretion [about\nwhether to give notice of a request for a subpoena], the court should consider the relevance of the subpoenaed material to the\ndefense, whether giving notice would prejudice the defense, and the degree to which the subpoenaed material implicates the\nprivacy and dignity interests of the victim.\" 267 This imprecise listing of discretionary factors misstates the law. The court is\nnot required to \"consider\" some victim-related factors and then make a discretionary decision. The CVRA commands that\nvictims have \"the right\" to \"be treated … with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\" 268 Thus, if withholding notice to a\nvictim fails to respect the victim's dignity and privacy (as I believe it invariably will), then the court must give notice - end of\nstory. 269 The CVRA flatly directs: [*910] \"In any court proceedings involving an offense against a crime victim, the court\nshall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described [in the CVRA].\" 270\nThe Advisory Committee Note is also an incomplete listing of the victim's rights that are implicated in decisions about issuing\nsubpoenas. From a procedural perspective, if the court holds a hearing on whether to issue the subpoena, the CVRA entitles a\n262\nCf. 42 U.S.C. § 254b(k)(3)(B) (2006) (enforcing confidentiality of medical records).\n263\n136 F.R.D. 55, 551-57 (W.D.N.Y. 1991).\n264\nId. at 556.\n265\nId. at 556-57. But cf. United States v. Beckford, 994 F. Supp. 1010, 1027 (E.D.

But the\nCVRA is presumed to be constitutional and the caselaw strongly supports the Act. See, e.g., Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 475 (1973)\n(finding no constitutional barrier to reciprocal discovery rules that act as a \"two-way street\"); cf. Forsythe v. Walters, 38 F. App'x 734, 737\n(3d Cir. 2002) (finding that \"application of the CVRA does not exact a punishment and therefore the CVRA can not violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause\").\n270\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *910\nPage 35 of 78\ncrime victim to notice of that proceeding 271 and to an opportunity to attend that hearing, unless the victim's testimony would\nclearly be materially affected from attending the hearing. 272 From a substantive perspective, subpoenas for personal or\nconfidential materials are often outside the scope of legitimate discovery, as will be explained in the next section. Such\nsubpoenas can also implicate a victim's right to \"be reasonably protected from the accused.\" 273 For example, a defense\nsubpoena to the Department of Motor Vehicles for address information could very directly jeopardize a victim's safety. 274 Yet\nthe Advisory Committee Note makes no mention of such legitimate factors - factors the CVRA requires courts to consider.\nFinally, given all this, if disclosure of defense \"strategy\" somehow remains the overriding issue in handling a subpoena, there\nare less-abusive means for dealing with the problem. For example, a court could give the victim notice of the subpoena but also\nenter an order forbidding the prosecution from using any information it might learn as a result of this disclosure. Such an order\nis far preferable to the ex parte procedure proposed by the Advisory Committee. For the above reasons, the Advisory\nCommittee's proposal for Rule 17 is insufficiently protective of crime victims' procedural rights. 275\n(3) The Lack of a Basis for Defense Subpoenas for Confidential Information\nThe Advisory Committee's approach is not only procedurally flawed but also substantively flawed. In particular, the Advisory\nCommittee arguably expands a defendant's power to subpoena confidential material from a victim, thereby creating new rights\nfor defendants at the expense of victims' rights under the [*911] CVRA. This violates the Rules Enabling Act, which provides\nthat court-promulgated rules shall not \"abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\" 276\nThe Advisory Committee's proposed rule would read: \"[A] subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim may not be served on a third party without a court order, which may be granted ex parte.\" 277 The\nclear implication of this sentence is that, with a court order, a subpoena can be served on a third party requiring production of\npersonal or confidential information. Nothing in the proposed rules (or the Advisory Committee Notes) appears to require any\nfurther showing before the subpoena would issue. This seems to give defendants unrestrained subpoena power over\nconfidential information. If this implication is correct, then the Advisory Committee has, remarkably, taken a law designed to\nprovide more protection for victims and used it to create less in clear contravention of the CVRA and the Rules Enabling Act.\nThe governing law on subpoenas comes from United States v. Nixon, which interpreted Rule 17 to require a subpoenaing party\nto show relevancy, admissibility, and specificity of any information sought. 278 In particular, for a subpoena to issue before\ntrial, Nixon requires the moving party to show:\n(1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by\nexercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance\n271\nId. § 3771(a)(2).\n272\nId. § 3771(a)(3).\n273\nId. § 3771(a)(1).\n274\nIn addition, the ability to subpoena such information would directly undermine current caselaw, which grants the defendant no right to\ndisclosure of the names and addresses of government witnesses before trial. For further discussion, see infra notes 325-335 and\naccompanying text.\n275\nApparently as a partial response to these concerns, the Advisory Committee made some changes in its proposed amendment to Rule 17.\nSee infra notes 232-233 and accompanying text.\n276\n28 U.S.C. § 2072(b).\n277\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 17(c)(3), at 7.\n278\n418 U.S. 683, 700 (1974).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *911\nPage 36 of 78\nof trial and that failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in\ngood faith and is not intended as a general \"fishing expedition.\" 279\nBecause of this governing law, I proposed that Rule 17 should itself identify restrictions on a defendant's ability to subpoena\nconfidential information. My proposal incorporates specificity, relevancy, and admissibility components - conforming with,\nrather than altering, existing law. My current proposal 280 requires the information be specifically described and admissible at\ntrial - and it bars evidence sought for impeachment purposes only. In contrast, the Advisory Committee seemingly enlarges the\nsubstantive rights of defendants by failing to reference even a single Nixon factor in its proposal. Thus, unless a court takes it\nupon itself to ensure the relevancy, specificity, and admissibility of the subpoenas, [*912] the Advisory Committee proposal\nmight provide the defendant with license to conduct the very \"fishing expedition\" that Nixon forbids.\nThe proposed Advisory Committee Note adds to this confusion. The Note indicates that in considering whether to issue the\nsubpoena, the court should consider \"the relevance of the subpoenaed material to the defense.\" 281 But this is an overly broad\nformulation. The court should only consider the relevance of the material to the defense at trial, since this is the only\npermissible basis for a subpoena.\nCurrent law clearly limits Rule 17 subpoenas to evidence that is admissible at trial. 282 The reason for Nixon's limitations of\nrelevance, admissibility, and specificity is that subpoenas are \"not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal cases\"\nbut only to \"expedite the trial by providing a time and place before trial for the inspection of subpoenaed materials.\" 283 With\nregard to admissibility, Nixon explained that \"generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its\nproduction in advance of trial.\" 284 In other words, documents sought for the narrow purpose of impeachment are not\nevidentiary for the purposes of Rule 17. 285 In Nixon, only because the prosecutor made a sufficient preliminary showing that\nthe subpoenaed tapes contained \"evidence admissible with respect to the offenses charged in the indictment\" and that the\nevidence could be validly used as nonimpeachment evidence, did the Court find the evidence to be subpoenable. 286\nCourts apply Nixon's admissibility test strictly, rejecting, for example, subpoenas for hearsay evidence that would be\ninadmissible at trial. 287 The cases have recognized that broad subpoenas run afoul of these limitations - including subpoenas\nseeking information about crime victims. 288 For example, in United States v.

Percy,\nthe Vermont Supreme Court upheld the lower court's refusal to order production by the victim. 292 The defendant had\nrequested production of the victim's mental health information, arguing it was necessary for him to present his defense. 293 The\nVermont Supreme Court rejected the defendant's arguments, finding that he made no showing of the materiality or helpfulness\nof the information - \"indeed, [the] defendant essentially admitted the underlying acts.\" 294 The court also found it notable that\nthe information sought was in the hands of a third party - not the State - and that the defendant made a broad request, rather\nthan specifying particular records in the subpoena. 295 In aggregate, the court considered those factors \"fatal\" to the defendant's\nrequest. 296\nThese cases were all decided against a constitutional backdrop that must favor crime victims: a criminal defendant has no\nconstitutional right to conduct discovery, while confidential and personal information of crime victims may be protected by a\nconstitutional right of privacy.\nThe Supreme Court has clearly held that \"there is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case.\" 297 Indeed,\nthe Constitution \"has little to say regarding the amount of discovery which the parties must be afforded.\" 298 The only\nremotely related due process requirement the Court has recognized is the requirement that prosecutors disclose evidence that is\nfavorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment 299 - evidence that would deprive the defendant of a fair trial if not\ndisclosed. 300 But even this rule - the Brady rule - is not a discovery rule and it does not reflect any discovery rights. Rather, it\nis a \"self-executing constitutional rule\" - a rule of \"fairness and minimum prosecutorial obligation.\" 301 Recognizing this, the\nSupreme Court has carefully circumscribed Brady: \"An interpretation of Brady to create a broad, constitutionally required right\nof discovery would entirely alter the character and balance of our present systems of [*914] criminal justice.\" 302 Indeed,\n289\n75 F.3d 1275, 1283-84 (8th Cir. 1996).\n290\nId. at 1283.\n291\nId.

Rev. 861, *914\nPage 38 of 78\nBrady's requirements are incongruous with traditional discovery, as Brady does not even apply at pretrial stages. 303 Rule 16\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was built on this foundation. The assumption that no right to discovery exists \"is\nstill the underlying predicate for Rule 16.\" 304\nBecause there is no constitutional right to discovery, discovery is determined largely by statute and court rule. 305 Discovery\nstatutes typically apply to exculpatory material within the possession or control of the state. 306 For example, in the Supreme\nCourt case of Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, the defendant sought recorded statements made to a youth counselor concerning an\nalleged assault. 307 The recorded statements were taken and possessed by Pennsylvania's Children and Youth Services, a statecreated\nagency. 308 The Court concluded that due process considerations required an in camera review of the records to see\nwhether they might contain information material to the defense. 309 The Court explained that \"it is well settled that the\ngovernment has the obligation to turn over evidence in its possession that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt\nor punishment.\" 310 The Court cited the well-known decision of Brady v. Maryland, 311 as authority for this conclusion. 312\nRitchie and other cases relying on Brady have no relevance to the issue of subpoenas to third parties. \"Brady imposes a\nconstitutional duty on prosecutors to turn over exculpatory evidence … .\" 313 The rationale for such a rule is that the\nprosecutor, after initiating criminal charges, should not be the \"architect\" of an unfair proceeding. 314 Plainly, crime victims\n(and third parties holding records about crime victims) are not state actors. They are not architects of the criminal proceedings\nand therefore are not subject to these constitutional restrictions on state action. The Seventh Circuit explained this point clearly\nin United States v. [*915] Hach. 315 There, the defendant sought to compel a third-party witness to turn over her medical and\npsychiatric records to the court for in camera review. 316 The witness refused to release her records, which were not held by\nany government agency. 317 The government argued it was powerless to force her to accede to the demand. 318 The Seventh\nCircuit agreed, holding that \"a failure to show that the records a defendant seeks are in the government's possession is fatal to [a\nRitchie claim].\" 319 The Seventh Circuit noted that the two other opinions it could locate on the due process question had\nreached precisely the same conclusion. 320 In United States v. Skorniak, the Eighth Circuit held that a defendant could not\nsubpoena medical records of a witness. 321 And the government is under no obligation to seek out potentially exculpatory\n303\nSee United States v.

Rev. 861, *915\nPage 39 of 78\nevidence, the court reasoned. 322 Similarly, a Maryland appellate court, in Goldsmith v. State, denied a defendant's attempt to\nobtain access to a witness's psychiatric record. 323 After examining the relevant authorities, the court explained: \"We find no\ncommon law, court rule, statutory or constitutional requirement that a defendant be permitted pretrial discovery of privileged\nrecords held by a third party.\" 324 Thus, crime victims (and third parties holding information about crime victims) will only\nrarely - if ever - have information a defendant is constitutionally entitled to examine.\nBecause a defendant has no constitutional right to discovery, any such claim must rest on a statute. Yet the federal statutes, if\nanything, cut against broad discovery claims. The Jencks Act, 325 for example, restricts access to statements by [*916]\ngovernment witnesses. 326 It specifically mandates that only after a government witness testifies on direct examination shall\nthe statement of the witness be the subject of discovery. 327 The Jencks Act does not even allow access to all statements - a\nwitness statement need only be produced if the statement \"relates to the subject matter \"as to which the witness has testified'\"\nnot if it merely \"relates to the subject matter \"at issue in [the] case.'\" 328 Even then, only a \"\"substantially verbatim recital of an\noral statement made by said witness to an agent'\" is discoverable under the Jencks Act. 329 Although the Act was meant to\npreserve defendants' right to access information that might aid in impeaching government witnesses at trial, \"the legislative\nhistory expresses a much greater concern with limiting the application of the Jencks decision so that it would not hamper the\nworkings of law enforcement by forcing wholesale disclosure of government materials and files.\" 330\nThe Jencks Act also bars any pretrial disclosure of witness statements. \"Congress provided for discovery of statements only\nafter the witness has testified, out of concern for witness intimidation, subornation of perjury, and other threats to the integrity\nof the trial process.\" 331 Courts have held true to this congressional determination, blocking defense efforts to obtain pretrial\ndiscovery about government witnesses. For example, in United States v. Coppa, the Second Circuit overturned the district\ncourt's approval of a scheduling order requiring the government to identify its witnesses in advance of trial. 332 The district\ncourt, \"mindful of [the Act's] concern\" for witness safety, had allowed the government to file ex parte motions delaying\ndiscovery of the witnesses' identity where such disclosure would pose a threat to the witnesses' lives or safety. 333 The Second\nCircuit, however, found this protection insufficient to meet the witness-protective goals of the Jencks Act. Specifically, the\n316\nId. at 946.\n317\nId.\n318\nId.\n319\nId. at 947. The Seventh Circuit also noted that the Wisconsin Supreme Court had reached a contrary conclusion, relying on state law\ngrounds. Id. at 946 n.5. The Wisconsin decisions do not offer a principled reason for extending Ritchie to private records and should not be\nregarded as persuasive authority here. See State v. Shiffra, 499 N.W.2d 719, 722 (Wis. Ct. App. 1993) (concluding that the issue of application\nof Ritchie to private records had already been decided in State v. S.H.); State v.

See, e.g., United States v. Hall, 171 F.3d 1133, 1145 (8th Cir. 1999)\n(upholding decision not to compel disclosure of witness medical and psychiatric records: \"the government has no obligation to obtain for a\ndefendant records that it does not already have in its possession or control\"); State ex rel.

Rev. 861, *916\nPage 40 of 78\ncourt determined \"this remedy does not address the Government's justifiable concerns regarding the risk of witness tampering\nin circumstances where there is no evidence that the life or safety of a prospective witness is in danger.\" 334 In other words,\nJencks Act protection is not limited to situations where the government shows an actual danger to witnesses - its witnessprotective\nqualities reach much further. 335\n[*917] The lack of grounds for subpoenas seeking victim information is more evident when viewed against a legal landscape\nthat gives defendants no right before trial to obtain even the names of government witnesses. Current law provides no basis for\nthe pretrial disclosure of the names and addresses of government witnesses - including witnesses who are crime victims. For\none thing, Rule 16, which governs discovery and inspection in criminal cases, contains no provisions for such disclosure. This\nomission was purposeful and mirrors the witness-protective purposes of the Jencks Act:\nA majority of the Conferees [that is, congressional members determining the language of Rule 16] believe it is not in the\ninterest of the effective administration of criminal justice to require that the government or the defendant be forced to reveal the\nnames and addresses of its witnesses before trial. Discouragement of witnesses and improper contacts directed at influencing\ntheir testimony, were deemed paramount concerns in the formulation of this policy. 336\nRule 16, therefore, along with other criminal discovery rules, \"does not entitle defendants to pretrial discovery of names and\naddresses of prospective government witnesses or persons who have knowledge of the case.\" 337\nBy statute, capital cases are exempt from this rule. In capital cases, the accused is entitled to a copy of the indictment and a list\nof juror and witness names and address - but only three days in advance of the trial. 338 And notably, the same statute\nexplicitly provides for the withholding of this information \"if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that providing\nthe list may jeopardize the life or safety of any person.\" 339 No statute authorizes similar disclosures in noncapital cases. As\nthe Eighth Circuit noted in United States v. Hutchings, \"neither [Rule 16(a)] governing information subject to disclosure by the\nGovernment in criminal cases, nor any other federal rule or statute requires the Government to supply names of potential\n327\nSee id. § 3500(b); see also Fed.

Rev. 861, *917\nPage 41 of 78\nwitnesses to a criminal defendant in a noncapital case.\" 340 Many other courts have reached substantially the same conclusion.\n341\n[*918] A few older cases held that district courts possess authority to compel the government to disclose the identity of its\nwitnesses before trial. However, the basis for such grants of authority now seems defunct. For instance, in United States v.\nArmstrong, the Ninth Circuit recognized no authority exists in the federal rules for requiring the government to disclose the\nnames of its witnesses. 342 Still, the court held that district courts have authority to require such disclosure based on Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 57(b). 343 This rule acts as a stopgap: in the absence of controlling law, it allows judges to\n\"regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, these rules, and the local rules of the district.\" 344 In light of the\nconference report on Rule 16, compelling disclosure of witness names before trial appears inconsistent with the federal rules.\nAnd even if the Ninth Circuit's approach was valid at the time Armstrong was decided, such an approach is no longer valid in\nlight of the CVRA. Rule 57(b) only provides a basis for court authority in the absence of controlling law - since 2004, the\nCVRA has controlled the treatment of victims. The CVRA clearly mandates a victim be \"reasonably protected from the\naccused,\" 345 as well as treated with \"fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\" 346 Disclosure of a\nvictim's name and address before trial is governed by these mandates, not vague gap-filling provisions.\nIf a defendant cannot even validly compel disclosure of a victim's name and address in advance of trial, it is nonsensical to\nthink a defendant could validly subpoena the same information from the Department of Motor Vehicles or the telephone\ncompany - and it is incredible to think a defendant could use the Advisory Committee's rule to subpoena even more personal\nvictim information. The rules would be backward indeed if a defendant were able to subpoena a victim's confidential mental\nhealth records in a legal system that disallows compelled disclosure of a witness's name or address. Instead, the only rational\nconclusion is that because defendants have no right to witnesses' identifying information, they certainly have no right to other\nsorts of victim-related discovery. Clearly, then, defendants have little constitutional or statutory \"heft\" behind an argument for\nsubpoenas directed at obtaining victim information.\nOn the other hand, victims will often have legitimate reasons for resisting such subpoenas - reasons that are protected not only\nby the CVRA but also by the Constitution, under current case law, and as part of the right of privacy. 347 One aspect of this due\nprocess privacy right is \"the individual interest in avoiding [*919] disclosure of personal matters\" 348 or, in other words, \"the\n340\n751 F.2d 230, 236 (8th Cir. 1984); accord United States v.

See\nWendy J. Murphy, Crime Victims, Not Defendants, Enjoy Constitutional Rights When the Accused Seeks Access to Private Third-Party\nRecords (2007) [hereinafter Murphy, Crime Victims]; see also Wendy J.

Rev. 861, *919\nPage 42 of 78\nprivacy interest in keeping personal facts away from the public eye.\" 349 Consider, for example, the privacy of therapeutic\ncounseling communications. Federal case law establishes that such communications are protected by a constitutional privacy\nright 350 - a right that would be gutted if defendants were allowed to freely subpoena victims' mental health records. Moreover,\nsome courts and commentators suggested the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures\napplies to (and may prohibit) court-mandated discovery of victims. 351\nFor all these reasons, a defense subpoena seeking third-party information about a crime victim rests on extraordinarily shaky\nground. The Advisory Committee must ensure that through casual drafting it does not inadvertently invite more defense\nsubpoenas for such information. The Advisory Committee's current draft may well have that effect, by seemingly authorizing\nsuch subpoenas without regard to the numerous restrictions governing their use (and even allowing them to be issued ex parte).\nThe Committee should, instead, follow my approach by indicating very clearly that such subpoenas are only allowed where\nspecifically identified evidence will be obtained that is relevant to and admissible at trial, and [*920] that is otherwise\nreasonable. As a weaker but still positive alternative, the Committee could include an Advisory Committee Note making this\npoint clear. One possible note would be as follows:\nRule 17(c)(3) is intended to provide greater procedural protection for crime victims than exists under current law. It is not\nintended to expand in any way the permissible grounds for defense subpoenas. Like other trial subpoenas, a defense subpoena\nseeking victim information must narrowly request only information admissible at trial and may not be used for discovery. See\nUnited States v.

See infra notes 588-592 and accompanying text.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *920\nPage 43 of 78\nUnless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was\ncommitted. The court must set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant, any\nvictim, and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice. 353\nThe Advisory Committee adopted this proposal verbatim. 354\n[*921] Discussion:\nLittle needs be said about the Advisory Committee's agreement with my proposal here, other than to note that the Committee's\nrationale for this change was \"to implement the victim's \"right to be treated with fairness' under the Crime Victims' Rights Act.\"\n355 Why the Advisory Committee chose to implement the victims' fairness rights in Rule 18 - and only Rule 18 - is not\nimmediately clear. 356\nRule 20 - Victims' Views Considered Regarding Consensual Transfer The Proposals:\nI proposed that Rule 20 be amended to allow the court to consider the victim's views in any decision to transfer a case as\nfollows:\nRule 20. Transfer for Plea and Sentence\n(a) Consent to Transfer. A prosecution may be transferred from the district where the indictment or information is pending, or\nfrom which a warrant on a complaint has been issued, to the district where the defendant is arrested, held, or present if:\n(1) the defendant states in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere and to waive trial in the district where the\nindictment, information, or complaint is pending, consents in writing to the court's disposing of the case in the transferee\ndistrict, and files the statement in the transferee district; and\n(2) the United States attorneys in both districts approve the transfer in writing after consultation with any victim. If any victim\nobjects to the transfer, the United States attorney in the transferring district or the victim's attorney shall advise the court where\nthe indictment or information is pending of the victim's concerns. 357\nI also proposed a similar change should be made to Rule 20(d) regarding transfer of juvenile proceedings. 358\nThe Advisory Committee recommended no change to Rule 20. 359\n[*922] Discussion:\nThe Advisory Committee rejected this proposed change for the following reasons:\nThe CVRA does not specifically address transfer. It does give the victim a right to confer with the attorney for the government,\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5), but that is not the same as requiring the attorney for the government to notify the court of the victim's\nviews regarding transfers. Indeed, the CVRA provides that \"nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair the\nprosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6). Accordingly, the\n353\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 878-79.\n354\nSee Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 18, at 9.\n355\nId. at 352.\n356\nSee supra notes 95-97 and accompanying text (discussing this point).\n357\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 879-80.\n358\nId. at 879-80.\n359\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *922\nPage 44 of 78\nCVRA contemplates that the attorney for the government will consider the victim's interests in exercising prosecutorial\ndiscretion, including the discretionary determination whether to consent to a Rule 20 transfer. The Subcommittee was not\npersuaded that the rule should disturb this statutory balance by requiring the attorney for the government to advise the court of\na victim's objection to a Rule 20 transfer. In appropriate cases, the attorney for the government should appraise the court of the\nvictim's view. 360\nThe Advisory Committee is able to claim that the CVRA does \"not specifically address transfer\" only because it reviewed an\namputated CVRA - that is, a CVRA without a right to fairness. Under an unblinkered fair reading of the CVRA, the right to\nfairness applies \"specifically\" to Rule 20 transfer decisions, no less than the Rule 18 decision to set the place of prosecution just\ndiscussed and, indeed, all other decisions in the criminal justice process. Thus, the Advisory Committee has unfairly stacked\nthe deck in deciding that it would not \"disturb this statutory balance,\" when it chose not to weigh the victim's right to fairness\nas part of that balance.\nEven under its truncated view of the statute, the Advisory Committee does envision that the prosecutors will confer with\nvictims about Rule 20 transfer decisions. But the Committee did not want to require prosecutors to notify courts of a victim's\nobjection, venturing only that \"in appropriate cases, the attorney for the government should appraise the court of the victim's\nviews.\" 361 The Committee is coy on the question of when it would not be appropriate for the prosecutor to fail to notify a\ncourt of the victim's views. Whenever an unrepresented crime victim objects to transferring a case, prosecutors, as officers of\nthe court, have a duty to pass that objection along to the court as relevant [*923] information bearing on the transfer decision.\n362 The rule should state that fact directly.\nFinally, nothing in my proposal would impair prosecutorial discretion. My proposal deals solely with ensuring that victim\ninformation is passed along to the judge who must approve a transfer decision. The government remains entirely free to make\nwhatever decision it wants on the issue and argue whatever position it believes is appropriate. Moreover, the CVRA itself\nenvisions that the government may have obligations to assert victims' rights. For starters, the CVRA requires prosecutors to\n\"make their best efforts\" to see that victims are \"accorded\" their rights. 363 In addition, the CVRA gives prosecutors the ability\nto \"assert\" victims' rights. 364 This provision was designed to ensure that victims' rights are not inadvertently lost because a\nvictim lacks legal counsel. As Senator Kyl explained, \"This provision also recognizes that, at times, the government's attorney\nmay be best situated to assert a crime victim's rights … because the crime victim is not available at a particular point in the trial\n… .\" 365 In light of its obligations to accord victims their rights and to enforce those rights, the government should at least\ninform the court when a victim has concerns about a transfer.\nRule 21 - Victims' Views Considered Regarding Transfer for Prejudice The Proposals:\nI proposed that Rule 21 be amended to require consideration of the victim's interest in whether a case should be transferred as\nfollows:\n(e) Victims' Views. The court shall not transfer any proceeding without giving any victim an opportunity to be heard. The court\nshall consider the views of the victim in making any transfer decision. 366\n360\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 17.\n361\nId. (emphasis added).\n362\nCf. State v. Casey, 2002 UT 29, PP 9-13, 44 P.3d 756 (noting prosecutors' obligation to relay to the court victim's request to be heard).\n363\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (2006).\n364\nId. § 3771(d)(1).\n365\n150 Cong. Rec. S10912 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n366\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 880.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *923\nPage 45 of 78\nThe Advisory Committee recommended no change to this rule. 367\nDiscussion:\nThe Advisory Committee rejected this change because, in its view, the fact that the CVRA did not specifically address transfer\ndecisions precluded any amendment:\n[*924]\nJudge Cassell grounds his proposal on the general provision of the CVRA that gives a victim a right to be treated with\n\"fairness.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8). The Subcommittee was not persuaded that this general language warranted an amendment\nthat would require the court to consider the victim's views. In the case of transfers for prejudice, the preferences of the victim\ncould not outweigh the defendant's right to a fair proceeding. In the case of transfers for convenience, the statutory right to\nconfer with the attorney for the government provides the mechanism for incorporating the victim's views. As in the case of\nRule 20, the Subcommittee declined to go beyond the carefully crafted limitations of the statute. In appropriate cases, the\nattorney for the government should appraise the court of the victim's views. 368\nOnce again, the Advisory Committee's position clashes with the statute. The Committee does not argue (nor does it seem\nplausible to argue) that transferring a case to a distant location without even considering the victim's view treats the victim\nfairly. Instead, the Committee ducks the implications of the right to fairness because it is \"general language,\" as though a\n\"general\" command from Congress can be ignored.\nPerhaps recognizing the weakness of its position, the Advisory Committee goes on to craft a policy argument against victims\nbeing heard. It divides transfer cases into two types - those for convenience and those for prejudice - and concludes that victims\nshould not enjoy a guaranteed right to be heard in either situation. In neither case is the analysis convincing.\nWith regard to transfers for convenience, the Committee contends that the victim's right to confer with prosecutors is sufficient\nprotection. But a victim's conference with those very same government authorities who find it convenient to move the case\nhardly will give victims much comfort - much less the right to fairness that Congress has mandated. The Committee also is less\nthan clear when it directs prosecutors to advise the court of the victim's objections \"in appropriate cases.\" It is hard to think of\nany case when a prosecutor would be justified in concealing an unrepresented victim's concerns from the court. 369 It is far\nsimpler - and, more to the point, simply fair - to ensure that the court will always consider a victim's views on transfer.\nWith regard to transfers to avoid prejudice, the Advisory Committee concludes that a victim's views could not \"outweigh\" the\ndefendant's right to a fair proceeding. But no one argues that victims' views will necessarily outweigh a defendant's argument;\nthe limited point is simply that victims' views should be considered in the balance. Moreover, a victim may be able to\ndemonstrate that a defendant's argument is unsupported or that other, less burdensome alternatives to [*925] transferring a\ncase exist. Surely these are sufficiently important reasons to let a victim be heard before a case is moved.\nThe Advisory Committee also appears to overlook the constitutional grounding that a victim's opposition to a transfer decision\nenjoys. In contrast to the Sixth Amendment, which gives defendants in a state prosecution a right to trial in their home state,\n370 Article III simply commands that in a federal prosecution, \"the Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall\nbe by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes have been committed.\" 371 This Article III vicinage\nright was designed to protect not only the rights of the defendant but also the rights of the community - including victims in the\n367\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n368\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 17-18.\n369\nIn the case of a represented victim, the prosecutor could reasonably rely on the victim's counsel to present appropriate arguments.\n370\nU.S. Const. amend. VI (\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of\nthe State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed … .\" (emphasis added)).\n371\nU.S. Const. art. III, § 2 (emphasis added).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *925\nPage 46 of 78\ncommunity. 372 The provision is designed to secure a trial within the same political community (\"the state\") in which the\nvictim would likely reside. 373\nThe Supreme Court's decisions on right of public access to trials bolsters the understanding of the Article II's provision to\nprotect the community interest. In cases such as Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, the Court has held that implicit in the\nFirst Amendment is a guarantee of the public's right to attend trials. 374 Compelling victims' interests underlie this guarantee.\nAs the Court has explained, \"public proceedings vindicate the concerns of the victims and the community in knowing that\noffenders are being brought to account for their criminal conduct.\" 375 And as Justice Blackmun has emphasized, \"The victim\nof the crime, the family of the victim, [and] others who have suffered similarly, … . have an interest in observing the course of\na prosecution.\" 376 Victims are vitally interested in observing criminal trials because society has withdrawn \"both from the\nvictim and the vigilante the enforcement of criminal laws, but [it] cannot erase from people's consciousness the fundamental,\nnatural yearning to see justice done - or even the urge for retribution.\" 377\nFor purposes of this Article, it is not necessary to definitively trace how victims' constitutional interests play out against a\ndefendant's right to avoid a prejudicial trial. The very limited point here is merely that victims should be heard on any transfer,\nso that a judge can make a fully informed decision. Even if the judge determines to transfer a case, the victim may have\nvaluable information for the judge on where to transfer the case (for example, to an adjacent district or state [*926] rather than\na distant one) or how to impanel an unbiased jury (for example, importing a jury rather than exporting the trial). 378\nAn illustration of the general approach of the proposed rule comes from the leading case of State v. Timmendequas, 379\ndecided by the New Jersey Supreme Court. In Timmendequas, the trial judge imported a jury from a distant community to hear\na capital case rather than forcing the family of a murdered young girl to travel to another district. 380 Construing New Jersey\nstate law provisions similar to the CVRA's, the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that the trial judge properly considered\nthe views of the victim's family:\nOver the past decade, both nationwide and in New Jersey, a significant amount of legislation has been passed implementing\nincreased levels of protection for victims of crime. Specifically, in New Jersey, the Legislature enacted the \"Crime Victim's Bill\nof Rights.\" That amendment marked the culmination of the Legislature's efforts to increase the participation of crime victims in\nthe criminal justice system.\nThe purpose of the Victim's Rights Amendment was to \"enhance and protect the necessary role of crime victims and witnesses\nin the criminal justice process. In furtherance of [that goal], the improved treatment of these persons should be assured through\nthe establishment of specific rights.\" One of the enumerated rights guaranteed for victims is \"to have inconveniences associated\nwith participation in the criminal justice process minimized to the fullest extent possible.\"\n372\nSee also Drew L.

Rev. 861, *926\nPage 47 of 78\n… .\n… . The [trial] court explicitly stated that it was not favoring the rights of the victims over those of defendant. Rather, it was\nsimply taking their concerns into consideration, as it had not done previously. Taking the concerns of the victim's family into\naccount does not constitute error, provided that the constitutional rights of the defendant are not denied or infringed on by that\ndecision. 381\nTimmendequas demonstrates that victims can have legitimate interests in transfer decisions that can be accommodated without\nviolating defendants' rights. Rule 21 ought to be amended to allow victims to provide that kind of information to the judge\nbefore any transfer decision is made. 382\n[*927] Rule 23 - Victims' Views Considered Regarding Nonjury Trial The Proposals:\nI proposed that the court should be required to consider the views of victims before allowing waiver of a jury trial as follows:\nRule 23. Jury or Nonjury Trial\n(a) Jury Trial. If the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, the trial must be by jury unless:\n(1) the defendant waives a jury trial in writing;\n(2) the government consents; and\n(3) the court approves after considering the views of any victims. 383\nThe Advisory Committee did not recommend any change to this rule. 384\nDiscussion:\nHere again, the Advisory Committee declined to adopt my recommendation because it goes \"beyond the specific provisions of\nthe CVRA, which do not address the issues whether the trial should be to the court or to a jury.\" 385 It is not necessary to repeat\nthe arguments about the victim's right to fairness here, other than to note that the \"preferred\" trial method in the federal courts is\na jury trial. 386 Why it is fair to deviate from that preferred method without first listening to the victims is not immediately\nclear.\nBut, for the sake of argument, assume that nothing in the CVRA requires the Advisory Committee to change this rule. The fact\nremains that the Advisory Committee could still change the rule if there were good reasons to do so. In view of this fact, it is\nsurprising that the Committee never defends the logic behind allowing a court to dispense with a jury trial without even hearing\nfrom a victim. To help protect the general public interest in trial by jury, Rule 23 currently requires not only prosecutor\n381\nId. at 76 (citations omitted). The hardship to the victim was established via affidavits from the victim's family provided to the court by\nthe prosecutor. Id.\n382\nThe Advisory Committee recently recommended a change to Rule 21(b) that does not address the points concerned in this Article.

Rev. 861, *927\nPage 48 of 78\napproval, 387 but also court approval. 388 Any approval [*928] requires careful weighing of the competing concerns. The\nSupreme Court has instructed that\nthe duty of the trial court … [in considering whether to approve a jury trial waiver] is not to be discharged as a mere matter of\nrote, but with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or\nfrom any of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity.\n389\nThis is a \"serious and weighty responsibility.\" 390\nTo discharge that serious and weighty responsibility, the Advisory Committee should draft Rule 23 so that the trial court should\nreceive as much relevant information as possible. The victim may be well situated to provide useful information about how the\npublic will view a nonjury trial. The proposed rule change takes the modest step of allowing the victim to be heard before the\ncourt approves any nonjury trial.\n(New) Rules 32(e), (f), (h), and (i) - Disclosure of the Presentence Report to Victims and Opportunity for Victims to Object and\nBe Heard 391 The Proposals:\nIn the federal system, the presentence report is a critical part of the sentencing process. I therefore recommended that the\nprosecutor should be required to disclose relevant parts of the presentence report to victims as follows:\n[*929]\n(e) Disclosing the Report and Recommendation.\n(1) Time to Disclose. Unless the defendant has consented in writing, the probation officer must not submit a presentence report\nto the court or disclose its contents to anyone until the defendant has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or has been found\nguilty.\n(2) Minimum Required Notice. The probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's\nattorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waives this minimum\nperiod. The attorney for the government shall, if any victim requests, communicate the relevant contents of the presentence\nreport to the victim.\n387\nFed. R. Crim. P. 23(a)(2). See generally ABA Standards for Criminal Justice § 15-1.2, cmt. at 15.17 (2d ed. 1980) (concluding that\narguments in favor of requiring prosecutorial approval of jury trial waivers outweigh those against). But see Adam H. Kurland, Providing a\nFederal Criminal Defendant with a Unilateral Right to a Bench Trial: A Renewed Call to Amend Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(a),\n26 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 309, 316 (1993) (arguing that the requirements of prosecutorial consent and court approval should be removed from\nRule 23(a)).\n388\nFed. R. Crim. P. 23(a)(3); cf. Akhil Reed Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitution, 100 Yale L.J. 1131, 1196-98 (1991) (suggesting that\njury trial right might not be waivable).\n389\nPatton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 312-13 (1930) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n390\nUnited States v. Saadya, 750 F.2d 1419, 1421 (9th Cir. 1985) (internal citation omitted).\n391\nIn addition to the changes to Rule 32 discussed here, the Advisory Committee essentially adopted verbatim my proposals to amend Rules\n32(a), 32(c)(1)(B), and 32(d)(2)(B). Compare Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 886, 887, 891, with Proposed Amendments,\nsupra note 71, R. 32(a), 32(c)(1)(B), 32(d)(2)(B), at 10-15. There is, accordingly, no need to discuss those proposed rules here.\nThe Advisory Committee also declined to add my proposal that the probation officer determine whether the victim wished to have any\nmaterial included in the presentence report. See Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 889. I will rely on my original article to\nmake the case for this particular change. See id. at 889-91\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *929\nPage 49 of 78\n(3) Sentence Recommendation. By local rule or by order in a case, the court may direct the probation officer not to disclose to\nanyone other than the court the officer's recommendation on the sentence. 392\nI further recommended that victims be given the opportunity to object to and be heard on disputed issues in the presentence\nreport as follows:\n(f) Objecting to the Report.\n(1) Time to Object. Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections,\nincluding objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from\nthe report. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall raise for the victim any reasonable objection by the victim to\nthe presentence report.\n(2) Serving Objections. An objecting party must provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and to the probation\nofficer.\n(3) Action on Objections. After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties and the victim to discuss\nthe objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.\n… .\n(h) Notice of Intent to Consider Other Sentencing Factors. 393 Before the court may rely on a ground not identified either in the\n[*930] presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission or in a victim impact statement, the court must give the parties\nreasonable notice that it is contemplating either departing from the applicable guideline range or imposing a non-guideline\nsentence. The notice must specify any ground not earlier identified on which the court is contemplating a departure or a nonguideline\nsentence. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall advise defense counsel and the court of any ground\nidentified by the victim that might reasonably serve as a basis for departure.\n(i) Sentencing.\n(1) In General. At sentencing, the court:\n(A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any\naddendum to the report;\n(B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of - or summarize in camera - any\ninformation excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them\na reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;\n(C) must allow the parties' attorneys and any victims to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters\nrelating to an appropriate sentence; and\n(D) may, for good cause, allow a party or any victim to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.\n(2) Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement. The court may permit the parties or the victim to introduce evidence on the\nobjections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a)-(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order\nto produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.\n(3) Court Determinations. At sentencing, the court:\n(A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;\n392\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 892.\n393\nThis rule was amended in December 2006, after my earlier article was published, to change \"departure\" language to conform with the\nnew, post-Booker regime.

Rev. 861, *930\nPage 50 of 78\n(B) must - for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter - rule on the dispute or determine that\na ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in\nsentencing; and\n[*931] (C) must append a copy of the court's determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made\navailable to the Bureau of Prisons. 394\nThe Advisory Committee recommended no changes to these rules. 395\nDiscussion:\nThe CVRA entitles victims to be heard on disputed Federal Sentencing Guidelines (\"Guidelines\") issues and, as a consequence,\nto review parts of the presentence report relevant to those issues. The CVRA gives victims \"the right to be reasonably heard at\nany public proceeding in the district court involving … sentencing.\" 396 The CVRA provision (among other things) codifies\nthe right of crime victims to give in court what is known as a \"victim impact statement.\" 397\nThe victim's right to be heard, however, is not narrowly circumscribed to just impact information. To the contrary, the right\nconferred is a broad one - to be \"reasonably heard\" at the sentencing proceeding. The victim's right to be \"reasonably heard\"\nimplicitly includes a right for the victim to speak to disputed Guidelines issues. As Senator Kyl explained, the victim's right\nincludes the right to make sentencing recommendations:\nWhen a victim invokes this right during … sentencing proceedings, it is intended that he or she be allowed to provide all three\ntypes of victim impact: the character of the victim, the impact of the crime on the victim, the victim's family and the\ncommunity, and sentencing recommendations. 398\nA \"sentencing recommendation\" will often directly implicate Guidelines issues, particularly where a court gives significant\nweight to the Guidelines calculation (as most currently do). 399 For example, if the victim wishes to recommend a sixty-month\nsentence when the maximum guideline range is only thirty months, that sentencing recommendation may be meaningless\nunless a [*932] victim can provide a basis for recalculating the Guidelines or departing or varying 400 from the Guidelines.\nCongress intended the victim's right to be heard to be construed broadly, as Senator Feinstein stated: \"The victim of crime, or\ntheir counsel, should be able to provide any information, as well as their opinion, directly to the court concerning the …\nsentencing of the accused.\" 401 Again, it is hard to see how victims can meaningfully provide \"any information\" that would\nhave a bearing on the sentence without being informed of the Guidelines calculations that likely will drive the sentence.\n394\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 901-02.\n395\nSee Proposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n396\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4) (2006).\n397\nSee generally Beloof, Cassell & Twist, supra note 6, at 625-90 (discussing victim impact statements); Cassell, Balancing the Scales, supra\nnote 6, at 1395-96.\n398\n150 Cong.

Rev. 861, *932\nPage 51 of 78\nIn addition, an independent basis for victims reviewing presentence reports is the victim's broad right under the CVRA to be\n\"treated with fairness\" 402 and right to restitution, as I argued in my earlier article. 403\nThus, the CVRA should be understood as giving victims the right to relevant information in the presentence report about the\nGuidelines and to be heard before a court makes any final conclusions about Guidelines calculations and other sentencing\nmatters. Many states follow a similar approach and give victims access to presentence reports as part of the victim-impact\nprocess. 404\nSince I made my proposal, the Ninth Circuit has considered the question of whether to reverse a district court that declined to\nprovide the entire presentence report to a fraud victim. In an opinion containing only one substantive paragraph, the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed the district court, which had rejected a victim's argument that \"the CVRA confers a general right for crime\nvictims to obtain [*933] disclosure of the [presentence report].\" 405 The Ninth Circuit stated tersely that the district court did\nnot \"commit legal error.\" 406\nAlthough strong arguments can be made against Kenna, 407 the case is not on point to my proposal. First, Kenna involved a\nclaim of a \"general right\" to access to the presentence report, apparently untethered to any particular need for access. My\namendment would be limited to situations where victims seek \"relevant\" contents of the presentence report to make a victim\nimpact statement at sentencing. Second, the victim in Kenna sought the entire presentence report. The Ninth Circuit pointedly\nobserved: \"We note that Kenna refused the district court's offer to consider disclosure of specific portions of the [presentence\nreport].\" 408 My proposal tracks what the district court offered to Kenna - that a victim would have access to \"relevant contents\nof the presentence report.\"\nBecause victims have a right of access to relevant parts of the presentence report, the question then arises of how to provide\nthat access. In my earlier article, I recommended the simplest solution to the competing concerns would be to disclose the\nreport, upon request, to victims through the prosecutor. The prosecutor could filter out irrelevant confidential information and\nassist the victim by highlighting critical parts of the report. It might be objected that this approach would burden prosecutors.\n402\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8) (2006).\n403\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 894-96; see also Testimony of Paul G.

Rev. 861, *933\nPage 52 of 78\nBut the CVRA already gives victims the right to \"confer\" with prosecutors 409 - and presumably they will be conferring\nregarding the important topic of sentencing. It is important to emphasize that my proposal would require prosecutors to give all\nrelevant information to the victim; in other words, prosecutors would serve as a conduit to the victim, but not a controller of the\nvictim.\nThe Advisory Committee declined to adopt my proposal, opining that \"the prosecutor should remain the victim's source of\ninformation regarding the sentencing process and the contents of the presentence report, and the prosecutor should have\ndiscretion to determine what information from the presentence report should be imparted to the victim.\" 410 This reasoning\nclashes directly with the CVRA's guiding principle: that victims deserve their own rights in the criminal process. Congress\nwanted victims to become participants with rights \"independent of the government or the defendant … .\" 411 For this reason,\nthe CVRA allows the [*934] victim to assert rights independently of the government. 412 Senator Kyl explained the victim's\nright to independent action directly: \"[There is no authority for] the government's attorney … to compromise or co-opt a\nvictim's right… . The rights provided in this bill are personal to the individual crime victim and it is that crime victim that has\nthe final word regarding which of the specific rights to assert and when.\" 413\nOne of the victim's independent rights includes the opportunity to make \"sentencing recommendations.\" 414 Congress's\ncommand that victims be independent participants cannot be faithfully implemented if prosecutors control the information\nvictims receive. If allowed to do so, prosecutors could simply feed the victim information supporting the government's view,\nwhile withholding information undercutting it. 415 Nothing in the CVRA provides any support for this approach. 416\nThe Advisory Committee was also concerned that presentence reports \"are typically treated as confidential, because they\ninclude a great deal of personal information about the defendant … .\" 417 But this concern was easily handled by my\nrequirement that prosecutors pass along only \"relevant\" contents of the presentence reports. Personal information only\ntangentially connected to sentencing issues would not be disclosed. And if personal information about the defendant were\ndirectly connected to sentencing issues, then fairness entitles the victim to that information to formulate a sentencing\nrecommendation. After all, by the time of sentencing, the defendant has been found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of\nharming a victim. By committing a crime against the victim, the defendant has certainly forfeited some privacy interests -\nincluding the chance to keep from the victim information relevant to sentencing. It is also important to recall that this\ninformation is not truly confidential in the sense that no one else [*935] will see it. It has already been disclosed to the\nprobation officer, defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the judge.\n409\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5) (2006).\n410\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 18.\n411\n150 Cong.

Interestingly the view seems to have originated in a small\nsubcommittee with a representative from the Justice Department but no crime victims rights representative. See CVRA Subcommittee Memo,\nsupra note 66, at 1 (noting that Deborah Rhodes, Counselor to the Asst. Atty. Gen. of the Criminal Division, served on the subcommittee\ndrafting this language).\n416\nAt another point in its memorandum, the CVRA Subcommittee refers to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6), which provides that \"nothing in this\nchapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction.\" CVRA\nSubcomittee Memo, supra note 66, at 20. But the simple act of giving information in a court document (the presentence report) to crime\nvictims does not impair the government's decision of whether and how to prosecute a defendant. See supra notes 363-365 and accompanying\ntext (discussing impairment issue under Rule 20).\n417\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 18.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *935\nPage 53 of 78\nOnce the victim receives relevant information from a presentence report, the victim no less than other participants at sentencing\nshould be entitled to be heard on any disputed issues. For example, in a fraud case, if the defendant claims to have swindled\nonly $ 5,000 and the government claims the loss is $ 10,000, the victim should be entitled to press her argument that the loss\nwas $ 40,000. To do otherwise, is to deprive the victim of an opportunity to participate in the sentencing process and to turn the\nvictim impact statement into a meaningless charade.\nThe Advisory Committee's view on this point is curious. The Advisory Committee did not directly quarrel with the position\nthat victims should have the opportunity to be heard on disputed sentencing issues. Instead, the Advisory Committee would\nonly go so far as to suggest that it\nfelt it would be desirable for the courts gradually to flesh out what the right to be heard means in this [sentencing] context\n(determining, for example, when the right to be heard would include the right to introduce evidence). It is by no means clear\nthat the CVRA contemplates that victims will be entitled to access all of the particulars of the presentence report and be entitled\nto litigate issues concerning the application of various guidelines, etc. 418\nThis view is objectionable on many levels. First, given the congressional purpose of fundamentally changing the way crime\nvictims are treated in the criminal justice process, it can hardly be desirable for courts to \"gradually\" determine what rights\nvictims have. As Senator Kyl explained, \"A central reason for these rights is to force a change in a criminal justice culture\nwhich has failed to focus on the legitimate interests of crime victims.\" 419 The CVRA was \"meant to correct, not continue, the\nlegacy of the poor treatment of crime victims in the criminal process.\" 420\nSecond, the Committee diffidently opines that \"it is by no means clear\" that victims have the right to litigate disputed issues.\n421 I will turn to the substance of that claim shortly. But even assuming it to be true, a fundamental purpose of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure is to provide clarity on issues that would otherwise have to be litigated. 422 The Advisory\nCommittee could be \"clear\" that victims can litigate by simply putting in place my proposed rule. To do otherwise [*936] is,\nunfortunately, to invite continued uncertainty over a point of vital importance to crime victims.\nFinally, perhaps the reason that the Advisory Committee would venture only that it is unclear whether victims have the right to\ndispute sentencing issues was a reluctance to stake out the contrary position. To maintain that victims cannot dispute sentencing\nissues would collide with both statutes and common sense. As for statutory requirements, it is hard to understand how victims\nwill be \"reasonably heard\" at sentencing (as the CVRA commands) if they cannot contest the factors that may well drive a\nsentence - the Guidelines calculations. Moreover, Congress has already directly mandated that victims will have the\nopportunity to dispute sentencing factors when they relate to restitution. 423 Thus, if the Advisory Committee really wanted to\nstake out a victims-can't-litigate-at-sentencing position, it would have to awkwardly carve out a restitution exception. Finally, a\nvictim is simply not treated with \"fairness\" if she is entirely excluded from the Guidelines process. The Supreme Court has\nexplained that \"it is … fundamental that the right to … an opportunity to be heard \"must be granted at a meaningful time and in\na meaningful manner.'\" 424 It is not \"meaningful\" for victims to make sentencing recommendations without the benefit of\nknowing what everyone else in that courtroom knows - what the recommended Guidelines range is. Yet Congress plainly\n418\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 19.\n419\n150 Cong. Rec. S10911 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n420\nId. (statement of Sen.

Rev. 861, *936\nPage 54 of 78\nintended to pass a law establishing \"fair play for crime victims, meaningful participation of crime victims in the justice system,\nprotection against a government that would take from a crime victim the dignity of due process … .\" 425\nBy building victims into the Guidelines process, my proposal would also provide an important procedural protection to\ndefendants. My proposed amendment to Rule 32(f) would require that the victim's attorney or the prosecutor would raise any\nreasonable objection to the presentence report before the sentencing hearing, so that it could be discussed at a presentence\nconference and then presented in an organized fashion to the sentencing judge. I would also require either the victim's attorney\nor the prosecutor to give notice to defense counsel and the court where an upward departure argument might rest on any\ninformation provided by the victim. 426 Setting up the procedures in this way creates an orderly process for victim objections\nto affect sentencing - with fair notice to the defense. Otherwise, the court - and the defendant - might hear for the first time at\nsentencing that the prosecution was considering an upward departure based on information in the victim impact statement.\n[*937] The courts of appeals have split on the need for advance notice of an upward departure based on victim impact\nstatements. In United States v. Dozier, the Tenth Circuit held that a district court is required to give notice to a defendant before\ndeparting upward from the advisory guideline range based on victim impact statements. 427 The breadth of that holding may be\nlimited, however, by unusual facts: the presentence report did not identify victim impact information as a possible basis for an\nupward departure and the government conceded that a sentencing remand was appropriate. The Third Circuit has expressly\ndeclined to follow Dozier. In United States v. Vampire Nation, 428 the Third Circuit held that, in light of the Supreme Court's\ndecisions making the Guidelines advisory, 429 a defendant is always on notice that a judge might find a sentencing factor\ncalling for a sentence higher than that advised by the Guidelines. 430 With respect to victim impact statements, the Third\nCircuit highlighted the fact that victim impact statements at the sentencing hearing might provide a new, previously\nundisclosed ground for an upward (or downward) departure:\nThe right of victims to be heard is guaranteed by the Crime Victims' Rights Act (\"CVRA\") … . The right is in the nature of an\nindependent right of allocution at sentencing. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4) (affording victims a \"right to be reasonably heard at\nany public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding\"). Under the CVRA,\ncourts may not limit victims to a written statement. See Kenna v. United States District Court, 435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir.\n2006) (Kozinski, J.) (\"Limiting victims to written impact statements, while allowing the prosecutor and the defendant the\nopportunity to address the court, would treat victims as secondary participants in the sentencing process. The CVRA clearly\nmeant to make victims full participants.\"). Given that it would be impossible to predict what statements victims might offer at\nsentencing, it would be unworkable to require district courts to provide advance notice of their intent to vary their discretionary\nsentence based on victim statements that had not yet been made. 431\nThe contrasting positions of the Tenth and Third Circuits is part of a larger disagreement between the circuits on the extent to\nwhich the notice requirements in the criminal rules continue to operate under the now-advisory Guidelines regime. 432\n425\n150 Cong. Rec. S4264 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (emphasis added); see also Kenna v. U.S. Dist.

The Third, Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits have held the opposite. See United States v. Irizarry, 458 F.3d 1208, 1212\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *937\nPage 55 of 78\nFocusing specifically on the issue of victim impact information, the [*938] Third Circuit is correct that, under the current\nrules, it is \"unworkable\" to provide advance notice of upward (or downward 433 ) departures based on victim allocution at the\nsentencing hearing. Under my proposal, however, victims would be integrated into the presentence process for determining\nGuidelines issues, thereby ensuring that the defense has fair notice of any upward departure and the government has fair notice\nof any downward departure. Regardless of whether the Guidelines are advisory, this is the fairest way to proceed for\ndefendants, the prosecution, and victims.\n(New) Rule 32(i)(4) - Victims' Right to be Reasonably Heard at Sentencing The Proposals:\nEven before passage of the CVRA, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure gave victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse\nthe right to be heard at sentencing. After the CVRA extended such rights to all victims, I proposed simply striking the limitation\nin the rule so that it would apply to all victims as follows:\n(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is\npresent at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence … . 434\nThe Advisory Committee tracked my change of striking the crimes of violence and sexual abuse limitation; but the Committee\nalso substituted language from the CVRA about being reasonably heard as follows:\n(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is\npresent at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence to be reasonably heard.\n435\n[*939] Discussion:\nMy proposal retained the current language in Rule 32 allowing the victim \"to speak or submit any information about the\nsentence\"; the Advisory Committee would allow the victim \"to be reasonably heard\" at sentencing - language lifted from the\nCVRA.\nIn this area, the Advisory Committee has paradoxically used the CVRA as an occasion for possibly restricting victims' rights.\nUnder Rule 32(i)(4)'s current language, there is no doubt that the victim could \"speak\" at sentencing (that is, give an oral\nstatement). Under the proposed language, litigation could result about whether victims could be \"reasonably heard\" without\nbeing allowed to speak (that is, be confined to purely written submissions). Indeed, during the Advisory Committee meeting on\nthe proposal, the Advisory Committee reporter conceded that \"courts would have to construe exactly what [the phrase] meant\nas situations came before them.\" 436\nIt is worth reflecting for a moment on how backward the Advisory Committee's approach to this issue is. Before the CVRA's\nenactment, victims of crimes of violence and sexual assault had the right under Rule 32(i) \"to speak\" at sentencing (along with\nthe right to submit information). When Congress enacted the CVRA, the Advisory Committee and the Judicial Conference had\n(11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Vampire Nation, 451 F.3d 189, 195-98 (3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Walker, 447 F.3d 999, 1006-07\n(7th Cir. 2006); United States v. Egenberger, 424 F.3d 803, 805 (8th Cir. 2005). The First Circuit has held only that the failure to provide\nnotice does not constitute plain error. See United States v. Mateo, No. 06-1805, 2006 WL 1195676, at 1 (1st Cir. May 5, 2006).\n433\nFor a helpful correction to the idea that victims' interests are always adverse to defense interests at sentencing, see generally Benji\nMcMurray, The Mitigating Power of a Victim Focus at Sentencing, 19 Fed.

The Advisory Committee also proposes striking out existing language in the\nrule allowing guardians or family members to exercise the right to speak on behalf of minor and incapacitated victims. For criticism of this\ndeletion, see supra notes 117-125 and accompanying text.\n436\nAdvisory Committee Minutes, supra note 68, at 14 (comment of Prof. Beale).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *939\nPage 56 of 78\nboth approved broadening that rule to give all victims the right to speak. 437 (The Judicial Conference withdrew this proposed\nrule to allow reconsideration in light of the CVRA.) The CVRA gave victims the right to be \"reasonably heard\" at sentencing.\nOf course, the CVRA's obvious goal was to significantly expand the rights of crime victims. With respect to the right to speak\nin particular, one of the CVRA's primary sponsors stated: \"this section would fail in its intent if courts determined that written,\nrather than oral communication, could generally satisfy this right.\" 438 Yet, in the wake of all this, the Advisory Committee\nnow proposes a rule that does not guarantee that victims have the right to speak, leaving this to the courts to construe on a caseby-case\nbasis. This retreat on victims' rights truly stands the CVRA on its head.\nThe Advisory Committee should directly state that victims have the right to speak at sentencing, as the only courts to have\nreached the issue have held. 439 For [*940] instance, in United States v. Kenna, Judge Kozinski 440 explained that the\nCVRA's legislative history \"discloses a clear congressional intent to give crime victims the right to speak at proceedings\ncovered by the CVRA.\" 441 The court first highlighted the following statement by Senator Kyl:\nIt is not the intent of the term \"reasonably\" in the phrase \"to be reasonably heard\" to provide any excuse for denying a victim\nthe right to appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to\nappear personally and directly address the court. 442\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, another primary sponsor of the bill, remarked that Senator Kyl's understanding of the bill was \"[her]\nunderstanding as well.\" 443\nIn addition to these floor statements, the Kenna court cited a committee report for the proposed constitutional amendment to\nprotect victims' rights. The Senate Report on the amendment - an amendment that contained language nearly identical to the\nlanguage in the eventually enacted CVRA - reads that:\nThe victim's right is to \"be heard.\" The right to make an oral statement is conditioned on the victim's presence in the courtroom\n… . Victims should always be given the power to determine the form of the statement. Simply because a decision making body,\nsuch as the court … has a prior statement of some sort on file does not mean that the victim should not again be offered the\nopportunity to make a further statement … .

Rev. 861, *940\nPage 57 of 78\nBased on this legislative history, Kenna concluded that crime victims have the right to speak at CVRA-covered proceedings.\n445 Kenna explained that this interpretation advanced the purposes of the CVRA, for the \"statute was enacted to [*941] make\ncrime victims full participants in the criminal justice system.\" 446 The Advisory Committee should follow that lead and\nprovide that victims are guaranteed a right to speak at sentencing. 447 Of course, in cases involving numerous victims (for\nexample, a massive fraud case), the CVRA itself allows courts to fashion a \"reasonable procedure\" to accommodate the\ncompeting concerns. 448\nRule 44.1 - Discretionary Appointment of Counsel for Victim The Proposals:\nI proposed that the court's discretionary authority to appoint counsel for a victim should be included in a new rule as follows:\nRule 44.1 Counsel for Victims.\nWhen the interests of justice require, the court may appoint counsel for a victim to assist the victim in exercising his or her\nrights. 449\nThe Advisory Committee did not propose any change in the Rules on this subject. 450\nDiscussion:\nThe Advisory Committee never discussed this particular proposed change, so it is possible that its failure to adopt it was an\noversight. 451 In any event, here it is perhaps useful to emphasize just a few points in favor of this proposal.\nWhile the CVRA does not create a right to counsel for victims, nothing in the Act deprived the courts of their preexisting\ninherent authority. The courts generally have the right to appoint volunteer counsel in civil cases, 452 a power that would seem\nto extend to criminal cases. Indeed, the Supreme Court has left open the question of whether federal courts possess the inherent\nauthority to require counsel [*942] to provide legal services to the poor. 453 The local rules of some federal courts already\nexplicitly recognize this power. 454 In addition, Title 28 broadly permits the court in both civil and criminal cases to \"request\nan attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel.\" 455 And before Gideon v. Wainwright, 456 courts could request\n445\nId.\n446\nId.\n447\nIn possible response to such concerns as I raise here, the Advisory Committee modified the Advisory Committee Note to this rule. See\ninfra notes 587-589 and accompanying text.\n448\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(2) (2006).\n449\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 912-16.\n450\nSee Proposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n451\nSee CVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 17-20 (listing my proposals that the subcommittee decided not to recommend; my\nproposed Rule 44.1 change not among them).\n452\nSee generally Judy E.

Rev. 861, *942\nPage 58 of 78\nthat lawyers provide assistance to indigent criminal defendants. Presumably, that same power extends to requesting assistance\nfor crime victims. 457 In light of all these facts, federal courts have the inherent power to request attorneys to represent indigent\ncrime victims.\nAn illustration of this power is found in a decision by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina in\nUnited States v. Stamper. 458 In this rape case, a dispute arose over the admission of certain psychiatric reports concerning the\nvictim that the defense alleged demonstrated a pattern of making false allegations of sexual abuse. 459 She requested\nindependent counsel to protect her privacy interests. 460 After consulting with the victim, the court appointed counsel for her.\n461 The court then allowed her counsel to participate in hearings regarding the evidence, including cross-examination of the\nrelevant witnesses. 462\nMy proposed rule would simply confirm the existing discretionary power of the courts to appoint volunteer counsel\ndemonstrated in cases like Stamper. The rule is purely discretionary (the court \"may\" appoint counsel) and is limited to\nsituations where the interests of justice require appointment. The rule does not address payment for counsel, as this matter must\nbe left to subsequent appropriations from Congress. The court, however, can ask for volunteer counsel to assist victims pro\nbono.\nFinally, it might be argued that it is unnecessary to address this subject in a rule because the court's inherent authority to\nappoint counsel exists even without a rule. Both courts and victims, however, will find it useful to have this authority close at\nhand in the criminal rules. Rule 44 already covers the subject of appointing counsel for defendants in great detail, so adding a\nRule 44.1 addressing victims' counsel is a natural corollary. In addition, prosecutors are obligated by the CVRA to \"advise the\ncrime victim that the crime victim can seek advice of an attorney with respect to the rights described in subsection (a).\" 463\nThis may frequently [*943] require prosecutors to help victims obtain legal counsel. Accordingly, a separate rule on this\nsubject is appropriate. For all these reasons, the Rules should be amended to recognize the court's authority to appoint volunteer\ncounsel to represent a crime victim.\nRule 46 - Victims' Right to Be Heard Regarding Defendant's Release from Custody The Proposal:\nI proposed that a victim should be given the right to offer views regarding the defendant's release from custody and that the\ncourt should consider those views as follows:\n(k) Victims' Right to Be Heard. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any decision to release the defendant. The court\nshall consider the views of victims in making any release decision, including such decisions in petty cases. In a case where the\ncourt finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the right to be heard in open court, the\ncourt shall fashion a reasonable procedure to facilitate hearing from representative victims. 464\nThe Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. 465 It did, however, propose a global rule that would give victims a\nright to be heard at proceedings involving release:\n457\nSee Beloof, Cassell & Twist, supra note 6, at 381-82 (suggesting this conclusion).\n458\n766 F.

Victims\n(a) Rights of Victims.\n. . . .\n(3) Right to Be Heard.\nThe court must permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning release . . .\ninvolving the crime. 466\nDiscussion:\nThe Advisory Committee's global proposal gives victims the right to be \"heard\" on release decisions; but it fails to spell out\nwhat effect, if any, the [*944] victim's statement would have after the court heard the victim. In other words, the Advisory\nCommittee proposal seemingly codifies an empty gesture.\nIn contrast, my proposal would take the straightforward and important step of requiring a court to consider the views of the\nvictim in determining any release decision. 467 That requirement is added directly into the rule governing release decisions -\nRule 46. Adding a specific rule with specific consequences is far preferable to the Advisory Committee's approach and is\nconsistent with the CVRA's goal of ensuring \"reasonable conditions of pre-trial and post-conviction relief that include\nprotections for the victim's safety.\" 468\nRule 48 - Victims' Views on Dismissal to be Considered The Proposals:\nI proposed that the court should be required to consider the views of victims in deciding whether to grant a government's\nmotion to dismiss a case as follows:\nRule 48. Dismissal\n(a) By the Government. The government may, with leave of court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint. The\ngovernment may not dismiss the prosecution during trial without the defendant's consent. In deciding whether to grant the\ngovernment's motion to dismiss, the court shall consider the views of any victims. 469\nThe Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. 470\nDiscussion:\nThe Advisory Committee declined to adopt this recommendation for several reasons:\nThe Subcommittee recognized that victims will have a great interest in whether charges are dismissed. The CVRA does not,\nhowever, explicitly address dismissals, and it speaks only of not excluding the [victim] from, and providing the [victim with]\n… a right to be reasonably heard at public proceedings in the district court. If the government moves for dismissal there is\nordinarily no public proceeding. (When there is a [*945] public proceeding, the victim's right not to be excluded, and to be\nreasonably heard is provided for in Rule [60].)\n466\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60(a)(3), at 16.\n467\nExisting law has places where a victim's views could profitably be brought to bear. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c) (court to consider\nwhether release of the defendant \"will endanger the safety of any other person\").\n468\nSee, e.g., 150 Cong. Rec. S10910, S10910 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n469\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 918.\n470\nSee Proposed Amendments, supra note 71 (showing no proposed change for Rule 48).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *945\nPage 60 of 78\nIn light of the statutory statement in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6) that nothing in the CVRA \"shall be construed to impair the\nprosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General,\" as well as the separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the\ngovernment's decision to terminate a prosecution, the Subcommittee was not persuaded that the rule should be amended to\nrequire the court to consider the victim's views on dismissal. When there is no public court proceeding, the victim's views will\nbe taken into account through the right to confer with the government under 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). 471\nThe Advisory Committee's opening premise is clear enough - victims do indeed have \"great interest\" in whether charges are\ndismissed. But after this promising start, the Committee's logic is hard to track. The Advisory Committee seems to be of the\nview that, in situations where a court considers a motion to dismiss at a public proceeding, the victim would be heard. 472 Yet\nthe proposed Rule the Committee cites for this proposition - proposed Rule 60 473 - is actually drafted so narrowly that the\nvictim would have no right to be heard on such a motion. 474\nIn situations where the court considered a motion to dismiss without a public proceeding, the Advisory Committee takes the\nview that the CVRA does not \"explicitly address\" the subject. This view assumes, of course, that the victim's right to fairness\ndoes not come into play when the prosecution moves to drop previously filed charges. This assumption is incorrect. Rule 48\nalready requires leave of court for a dismissal. In determining whether to grant leave, current case law requires the court to\nconsider whether dismissal is \"clearly contrary to manifest public interest.\" 475 The existing caselaw requires that the impact\non a victim be considered in addressing a motion to dismiss. A dismissal is \"clearly contrary to the public interest\" if the\nprosecutor appears to be motivated by animus toward the victim. 476 Under the command of the CVRA, the victim thus must\nbe treated with fairness when the dismissal motion is addressed, as my proposal provides.\n[*946] When the government files a motion to dismiss criminal charges involving a specific victim, the only way to protect\nthat victim's right to be treated fairly is to consider the victim's views on the dismissal. 477 To treat a person with \"fairness\" is\nconventionally understood as treating them \"justly\" and \"equitably.\" 478 A victim is not treated justly and equitably if her\nviews are never before the court.\nThe Advisory Committee also alludes vaguely to \"separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the government's\ndecision to terminate a prosecution.\" Here the Advisory Committee may be stepping out of line and questioning the Supreme\nCourt. In 1944, the Court itself added the requirement to Rule 48 that prosecutors obtain leave of court before dismissing any\nindictment. 479 Thus, if there are separation of powers \"issues\" about judicial review of dismissals, they have existed for more\nthan half a century by virtue of specific Supreme Court action.\n471\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 20.\n472\nId.

See CVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 20.

P. 48 advisory committee's note recounting the history of the 1944 adoption.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *946\nPage 61 of 78\nThe Advisory Committee's next argument is that to allow victims to be heard on dismissals would violate the CVRA's\nrequirement that nothing in the Act \"shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General.\" 480 But\nit is hard to understand how allowing information from a victim to go to a court \"impairs\" the government's discretion.\nParticularly given that courts must already review the public interest in reviewing dismissal motions, executive branch power is\nnot impaired when a court hears from a victim in making its determination whether to approve. 481\nThe Advisory Committee's final argument is that \"when there is no public court proceeding, the victim's views will be taken\ninto account through the right to confer with the government … .\" 482 The passive voice (\"taken into account\") obscures the\noverarching fact that it is the government itself that is proposing to dismiss the charges. The victim deserves to be heard not\nmerely by the government agency proposing to drop the charges, but by the independent branch of government - the judiciary -\nthat will review that proposal. For all these reasons, Rule 48 should be amended to ensure that victims are heard because\ncharges are dismissed.\n[*947] Rule 50 - Victims' Right to Proceedings Free From Unreasonable Delay The Proposals:\nI proposed that a victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay should be recognized as follows:\nRule 50. Prompt Disposition\n(a) Scheduling Preference. Scheduling preference must be given to criminal proceedings as far as practicable.\n(b) Defendant's Right Against Delay. The court shall assure that the defendant's right to a speedy trial is protected, as provided\nby the Speedy Trial Act.\n(c) Victim's Right Against Delay. The court shall assure that a victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay is\nprotected. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any motion to continue any proceeding. If the court grants a motion to\ncontinue over the objection of a victim, the court shall state its reasons in the record. 483\nThe Advisory Committee proposed no change to this Rule. 484\nDiscussion:\nVictims have speedy trial rights under the CVRA, which grants victims the right \"to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\"\n485 In addition, child victims previously had the right to a \"speedy trial\" in certain situations. 486\nIn view of these statutory rights, I proposed supplementing the existing rule on scheduling (Rule 50) to fold in victims' rights.\nThe Advisory Committee did not explicitly discuss this proposal, suggesting that its failure to act was possibly due to oversight.\n487 Further suggesting oversight is the Advisory Committee's repeated statements that it \"sought to incorporate, but not go\n480\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6) (2006).\n481\nSee Heaton, 458 F. Supp. 2d at 1271-73 (reaching this conclusion). In Heaton, the government did not challenge this holding and, after\nthe decision requiring it to submit the victim's views, filed a pleading to that effect, all without any apparent separation of powers problem.\n482\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 20.\n483\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 918-19.\n484\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n485\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(7) (2006).\n486\nId. § 3509(j).\n487\nSee CVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 17-20 (cataloging my proposals that the subcommittee did not adopt; Rule 50 not\nmentioned).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *947\nPage 62 of 78\nbeyond, the rights created by statute\" and that it \"adopted the statutory language whenever possible.\" 488 Yet under the\nAdvisory Committee's proposed changes, victims' speedy trial rights under the CVRA are not incorporated into the Rules.\nVictims should have their rights regarding scheduling reflected in the rule dealing with scheduling issues. My proposed rule\nclosely tracks the language of [*948] the CVRA. 489 It does add a provision that victims would be heard on a motion to\ncontinue a proceeding. 490 This provision is consistent with the definitive legislative history. As Senator Kyl explained: \"This\nprovision [in the CVRA] should be interpreted so that any decision to schedule, reschedule, or continue criminal cases should\ninclude victim input through the victim's assertion of the right to be free from unreasonable delay.\" 491 My proposed rule also\nrequires that the court state its reason for granting any continuance. This requirement stems from a recommendation from the\nPresident's Task Force on Victims of Crime. The Task Force noted \"the inherent human tendency to postpone matters, often for\ninsufficient reason,\" and accordingly recommended that \"reasons for any granted continuance … be clearly stated on the\nrecord.\" 492 Several states have adopted similar provisions. 493\nRule 53 - Closed-Circuit Transmission of Proceedings for Victims The Proposals:\nI proposed that closed-circuit transmission of court proceedings for victims should be authorized as follows:\nRule 53. Courtroom Photographing and Broadcasting Prohibited\n(a) General Rule. Except as otherwise provided by a statute or these rules, the court must not permit the taking of photographs\nin the courtroom during judicial proceedings or the broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom.\n(b) Closed-Circuit Transmission for Victims. In order to permit victims of crime to watch criminal trial proceedings, the court\nmay authorize closed-circuit televising of the proceedings for viewing by victims or other persons the court determines have a\ncompelling interest in doing so. 494\nThe Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. 495\n[*949] Discussion:\nI proposed to facilitate a victim's protected right to attend a trial by allowing closed-circuit broadcasting of a trial. The Advisory\nCommittee did not act on this proposal for reasons that are unclear, as it did not include this proposed change in the catalog of\nmy proposals that it was rejecting. 496\nPerhaps the Advisory Committee felt that it had sufficiently addressed the subject in its proposed changes to Rule 60. There the\nCommittee simply tracked language in the CVRA and provided that \"if the court finds that the number of victims makes it\nimpracticable to accord all of the victims the rights described in subsection (a), the court must fashion a reasonable procedure\n488\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, at 2.\n489\nSee id.\n490\nId. at 19.\n491\n150 Cong.

Ann. § 13-4435(B) (2001) (requiring courts to \"state on the record the reason for the continuance\"); Utah Code\nAnn. § 77-38-7(3)(b) (2005) (requiring the court to \"enter in the record the specific reason for the continuance and the procedures that have\nbeen taken to avoid further delays\").\n494\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 922.\n495\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n496\nCVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 17-20.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *949\nPage 63 of 78\nto give effect to these rights that does not unduly complicate or prolong the proceedings.\" 497 Thus, in a situation where\nnumerous victims might overwhelm courtroom seating capacity, the court might craft a reasonable alternative procedure to\nassure attendance rights. One such reasonable procedure would appear to be closed-circuit transmission of court proceedings to\na facility sufficiently large to accommodate all the victims. This was the procedure followed in the Oklahoma City bombing\ncase. 498\nBut tracking the CVRA is not enough. The language for my proposed rule comes from another statute, 42 U.S.C. § 10608(a),\nwhich authorizes closed-circuit transmissions \"notwithstanding any provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to the\ncontrary\" in cases in which a proceeding has been transferred more than 350 miles. 499 The Advisory Committee repeatedly\nproposed folding language from the CVRA straight into the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. But if the goal is to fold\nstatutes into the Rules, other relevant victims' statutes should be folded in as well.\nWhile folding in a provision on closed-circuit broadcasting, there appears to be no good reason to limit such transmissions to\nsuch situations where venue has been transferred. The CVRA mandates that the courts must always craft \"reasonable\nprocedures\" to protect the rights of multiple victims. 500 The proposed rule simply authorizes courts to allow such\ntransmissions in appropriate cases. Interestingly, the CVRA's drafters specifically endorsed the closed-circuit procedure. 501\n[*950] For reasons that have yet to be articulated, the Advisory Committee has not only failed to act on my proposal but it has\nleft in place a conflict between a statute and Rule 53. As noted above, 42 U.S.C. § 10608(a) specifically trumps Rule 53 in\nsituations where cases have been transferred more than 350 miles. 502 The Rules should at least be amended to fix that conflict.\n503 While fixing that problem, the Advisory Committee should also adopt my change, which faithfully implements the CVRA's\ncommands.\n(New) Rule 60(a)(1) - Notice of Proceedings for Victims The Proposals:\nI proposed requiring federal prosecutors to give notice to crime victims of their rights and the court process as follows:\nRule 10.1 Notice to Victims.\n(a) Identification of Victim. During the prosecution of a case, the attorney for the government shall, at the earliest reasonable\nopportunity, identify the victims of the crime.\n(b) Notice of Case Events. During the prosecution of a crime, the attorney for the government shall make reasonable efforts to\nprovide victims the earliest possible notice of:\n497\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60(b)(3), at 24 (tracking 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(2) (2006)).\n498\nJo Thomas, Trial To Be Shown in Oklahoma for Victims, N.Y.

Moreover, as a simple matter\nof drafting clarity, it is desirable to have the Rules themselves avoid conflicts with statutes. Otherwise, courts may inadvertently follow the\nRules in violation of the statutory command.

Victims\n(a) In General.\n(1) Notice of a Proceeding. The government must use its best efforts to give the victim reasonable, accurate, and timely notice\nof any public court proceeding involving the crime. 505\nDiscussion:\nThe difference between my proposal and the Advisory Committee's is that I would give victims notice of both the hearings held\nin a case and the fact that they can speak at some of those hearings; in contrast, the Advisory Committee would give victims\nnotice only of the hearings. For example, I would place in the rule a requirement that victims be notified of their right to make a\nstatement at bail, plea, and sentencing hearings and told when the hearings would be held. The Advisory Committee would tell\nthe victim only when the hearings would be held. 506\n[*952] The Committee proposal disregards both the law and sound public policy. The CVRA directs that government\ninvestigating and prosecuting agencies \"shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded,\n504\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 859-60.\n505\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60, at 22.\n506\nThe Committee did agree with my recommendation that the notice should be provided by the Justice Department, not the courts. See\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 861-64. Originally, the CVRA Subcommittee had proposed that the Rules be silent on this\nimportant issue. See Advisory Committee Minutes, supra note 68, at 14 (suggesting that \"it is not clear whose burden it would be to provide\nsuch notice\" and \"Professor Beale recommended the passive phrasing\"). Apparently at some point after the meeting, the Advisory Committee\nchose to place the notification burden squarely on the government. See Advisory Committee Report, supra note 69, at 5. The Advisory\nCommittee apparently recognized that this requirement was already the law, as found in another statute, 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b), (c)(3)(A)-(D).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *952\nPage 65 of 78\ntheir rights [in the CVRA].\" 507 Because the Advisory Committee's promised approach was to \"incorporate, but not go beyond,\nthe rights created by the statute,\" 508 it is surprising to see that the Committee decided not to incorporate the CVRA's right for\nvictims to be \"notified of … their rights.\" Here again, perhaps it simply overlooked this right of victims. 509\nAs a policy matter, leaving out this right threatens to cripple crime victims' right to speak at bail, plea, and sentencing hearings.\nIf victims are unaware of their rights to speak, they may unwittingly forfeit that right. Of course, few victims are\nknowledgeable about the steps in the criminal justice process. Just as criminal defendants receive advice of their Miranda\nrights, victims should receive advice of their rights.\nAlthough the Committee did not justify its decision to exclude the right to notice, it might conceivably argue that because this\nright does not involve the conduct of a public judicial proceeding, it does not belong in the Rules. The Committee advanced\nsuch an argument to defend its decision to ignore some other aspects of the CVRA in its proposed rule changes. 510\nSuch an argument, at least if advanced with respect to notice issues, would lack merit. First, and most important, the rights at\nissue are directly bound up with judicial proceedings: at issue is notice about the right to speak at bail, plea, and sentencing\nproceedings. Moreover, this right directly bears on those proceedings. It is designed to ensure that a judge at these hearings will\nhave all relevant information, including information from crime victims.\nSecond, it is not true that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure only cover judicial proceedings. To provide a few\nstraightforward examples: Rule 11 authorizes prosecutors and defense attorneys to \"discuss and reach a plea agreement\"; 511\nRule 16 provides that, upon request, a prosecutor \"must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph books,\npapers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these items, if the\nitem is within the government's possession, custody, or control\"; 512 Rule 41 requires a police officer executing a search\nwarrant to \"give a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken to the person from whom [*953] … the property\nwas taken\"; 513 and Rule 49 requires parties to serve their legal pleadings on each other. 514 Although these rights may have\nsome ultimate effect on a court proceeding, none of them involves the conduct of a judicial proceeding. If they are \"in bounds\"\nfor the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the subject of notice about rights to a hearing would seem to fit comfortably as well.\nTurning to how to draft a rule giving victims notice of their rights, it is easy to reformulate my proposal so that it tracks the\nmore abbreviated style preferred by the Advisory Committee. Such a rule would read as follows (underlined language being\nadded to the Advisory Committee's proposed language):\n(1) Notice of a Proceeding. The government must use its best efforts to give the victim reasonable, accurate, and timely notice\nof any public court proceeding involving the crime and of the rights the victim has at those proceedings.\nIt is not unreasonable to ask prosecutors to give victims notice of their rights. As long ago as 1982, the President's Task Force\nof Victims of Crime concluded that the prosecutor is \"in the best position to explain to victims the legal significance of various\nmotions and proceedings.\" 515 The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance already require\n507\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (emphases added).\n508\nAdvisory Committee Report, supra note 69, at 2.\n509\nSee id. at 17-20 (purporting to catalog Cassell proposals rejected; notice of rights not included).\n510\nSee id. at 13 (listing rights that \"seem to fall outside the parameters of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure).\n511\nFed.

The court may proceed with a public proceeding without a victim if proper notice has\nbeen provided to that victim under Rule 10.1. The court may proceed with a public proceeding (other than a trial or sentencing)\nwithout proper notice to a victim only if doing so is in the interest of justice, the court provides prompt notice to that victim of\nthe court's action and of the victim's right to seek reconsideration of the action if a victim's right is affected, and the court\nensures that notice will be properly provided to that victim for all subsequent public proceedings. 519\nThe Advisory Committee did not propose any such change. 520\nDiscussion:\nIt seemed desirable to me to spell out how courts should proceed when victims lacked notice of a hearing. In contrast, the\nAdvisory Committee has chosen not to address the subject.\nBy not addressing the subject, the Advisory Committee may be suggesting that the court is forbidden from moving forward\nwhen a victim has not been given notice of a proceeding. The caselaw makes clear that when a defendant has not been given\nnotice, any subsequent court action is void. 521 The CVRA's legislative history shows that the same rule was to apply for\nvictims. As Senator Kyl explained,\nIt does not make sense to enact victims' rights that are rendered useless because the victim never knew of the proceeding at\nwhich the right had to be asserted. Simply put, a failure to provide notice of proceedings at which a right can be asserted is\nequivalent to a violation of the right itself. 522\n[*955] In light of the fact that a court might otherwise be barred from proceeding when a victim has not been given notice, it\nstill seems preferable to me to spell out a way to allow the court to move forward while simultaneously protecting victims'\ninterests. But I will not elaborate the point further here.\n(New) Rule 60(a)(2) - Victims' Right to Attend Trials Both the Advisory Committee and I proposed a rule that guarantees\nvictims the right to attend court proceedings except in those very rare instances where the victim's testimony would be\n516\nSee Attorney General Guidelines, supra note 161, at 23.\n517\nSee, e.g., Ala.

Rev. 861, *955\nPage 67 of 78\nmaterially altered by attending the trial. 523 Because the Advisory Committee proposal essentially tracks my proposal, it is not\nnecessary to discuss this issue here.\n(New) Rule 60(a)(3) - Victims' Right to be Heard on Bail, Plea, Sentencing and Other Issues The Proposals:\nI proposed not only specific rules allowing victim to be heard at release, plea, and sentencing hearings but also a general rule\ngiving victims the right to be heard on all issues directly affecting their rights as follows:\nRight to be Heard on Victims' Issues. In addition to rights to be heard established elsewhere in these rules, at any public\nproceeding at which a victim has the right to attend, the victim has the right to be heard on any matter directly affecting a\nvictim's right. 524\nThe Advisory Committee proposed only a narrow rule giving victims the right to be heard at only three specific points in the\nprocess - bail, plea, and sentencing hearings:\nRight to Be Heard. The court must permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court\nconcerning release, plea, or sentencing involving the crime. 525\n[*956] Discussion:\nThe Advisory Committee's proposed general rule on the victim's right to be heard is inferior to weaving that right into the\nspecific rules on release, plea, and sentencing. This issue is discussed earlier in this Article. 526 The larger issue to pursue here\nis the silence of the Advisory Committee on how a court should proceed when a victim's rights under the CVRA are at stake in\nother proceedings. For example, what if the court is considering continuing a trial in violation of a victim's right to\n\"proceedings free from unreasonable delay\"? 527 Or excluding the victim from a proceeding in violation of a victim's right \"not\nto be excluded from … public court proceeding\"? 528 Or turning over to the defense personal and confidential information\nabout the victim in violation of a victim's right \"to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and\nprivacy\"? 529 Or giving a defendant the victim's home address in an alibi situation in violation of the victim's right to be\n\"reasonably protected from the accused\"? 530\nMy proposed rule would state directly that the victim has the right to be heard on such issues. How the Advisory Committee\nwould handle such issues is unclear. The Advisory Committee's proposed rule on the victim's right to be heard only confers\nsuch a right for three specific hearings. The listing of three hearings might seem to suggest victims could not be heard\nelsewhere. But denying victims a chance to be heard at other hearings where their rights are implicated is such an obvious\nviolation of fundamental notions of fairness (not to mention the victim's right to fairness under the CVRA) that one should be\nreluctant to ascribe that position to the Advisory Committee.\n523\nSee Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 904-11; Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60(a)(2), at 16; see also In re\nMikhel, 453 F.3d 1137, 1139-40 (9th Cir. 2006) (reversing district court decision excluding victims from trial under the CVRA); Beloof &\nCassell, supra note 229, at 519-20 (concluding that the CVRA grants a \"nearly unqualified\" right for the victim to attend a trial).\n524\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 905, 911.\n525\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60(a)(3), at 16.\n526\nSee supra notes 464-468 and accompanying text (proposing amendments to Rule 48 regarding release); supra notes 151-158 and\naccompanying text (proposing amendments to Rule 11 regarding pleas); supra notes 434-448 and accompanying text (proposing\namendments to Rule 32).\n527\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(7) (2006).\n528\nId. § 3771(a)(3).\n529\nId. § 3771(a)(8); see also supra notes 231-351 and accompanying text (discussing amendments to Rule 17).\n530\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(1); see also supra notes 177-213 and accompanying text (discussing this question).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *956\nPage 68 of 78\nPart of the confusion here may stem from two different ways in which victims can be heard. The first way is when the victim's\nstatement is effectively built into the proceeding at issue. At sentencing hearings, for example, the CVRA envisions a specific\npoint in the process where the victim will have a chance to make a statement - the victim's allocution. 531 This is what the\nCVRA means when it refers to the victim's \"right to be heard\" at sentencing proceedings (along with plea and bail proceedings).\nBut the listing of victims' rights to be heard at those three specific hearings could not possibly have meant that victims would\nhave to remain silent at all other hearings.\n[*957] The CVRA envisions victims being heard in second sense - in arguing in favor of their rights. The CVRA directly gives\nvictims and their representatives the right to \"assert\" their rights. 532 These rights can be asserted by a victim's representative\n(that is, an attorney). 533 The CVRA also allows victims to file motions asserting their rights which must be taken up\n\"forthwith.\" 534 These are all ways in which victims can properly be heard. 535\nThe CVRA's legislative history makes it unmistakably clear that victims would be heard at other points in the process. Senator\nFeinstein explained that the basic goal of the CVRA was to give victims the right to \"participate in the process where the\ninformation that victims and their families can provide may be material and relevant … .\" 536 Senator Kyl also noted that the\nact's enforcement provisions would give victims rights to be heard throughout the process:\n[The CVRA's enforcement provisions] allow[] a crime victim to enter the criminal trial court during proceedings involving the\ncrime against the victim, [to stand with other counsel in the well of the court,] and assert the rights provided by this bill. This\nprovision ensures that crime victims have standing to be heard in trial courts so that they are heard at the very moment when\ntheir rights are at stake and this, in turn, forces the criminal justice system to be responsive to a victims' rights in a timely way.\n537\nAs one illustration of how this right to be heard operates, consider the victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable\ndelay. 538 Presumably, this right encompasses a victim's opportunity to be heard before a case is delayed. As Senator Kyl\nstated: \"This provision should be interpreted so that any decision to schedule, reschedule, or continue criminal cases should\ninclude victim input through the victim's assertion of the right to be free from unreasonable delay.\" 539\nIn view of all the different ways in which crime victims can be heard, it is appropriate to have a rule that speaks broadly to the\nsubject and protects victims' right to be heard whenever their rights are at stake. My proposed rule achieves that goal.\n[*958] (New) Rule 60(b) - Enforcement of Victims' Rights The Proposals:\nI proposed folding into the procedures a victim's right to assert an error as follows:\nRule 51. Preserving Claimed Error\n(a) Exceptions Unnecessary. Exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary.\n531\nSee supra notes 434-448 and accompanying text (discussing victim allocution).\n532\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(1).\n533\nId.\n534\nId. § 3771(d)(3).\n535\nSee, e.g., United States v.

A party or a victim may preserve a claim of error by informing the court - when the court\nruling or order is made or sought - of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party's objection to the court's action\nand the grounds for that objection. If a party or a victim does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence\nof an objection does not later prejudice that party. A ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is governed by Federal\nRule of Evidence 103. 540\nThe Advisory Committee proposed incorporating some of the language of the CVRA dealing with enforcement of victims'\nrights as follows:\nRule 60. Victim's Rights.\n… .\n(b) Enforcement and Limitations.\n(1) Time for Decision. The court must promptly decide any motion asserting a victim's rights under these rules.\n(2) Who May Assert Rights. The rights of a victim under these rules may be asserted by the victim or the attorney for the\ngovernment.\n(3) Multiple Victims. If the court finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the rights\ndescribed in subsection (a), the court must fashion a reasonable procedure to give effect to these rights that does not unduly\ncomplicate or prolong the proceedings.\n(4) Where Rights may be Asserted. The rights described in subsection (a) must be asserted in the district in which a defendant\nis being prosecuted for the crime.\n(5) Limitations on Relief. A victim may make a motion to re-open a plea or sentence only if:\n(A) the victim has asked to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue and the request was denied;\n[*959] (B) the victim petitions the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus within 10 days of the denial and the writ is\ngranted; and\n(C) in the case of a plea, the accused has not pleaded to the highest offense charged.\n(6) No New Trial. In no case is a failure to afford a victim any right under these rules grounds for a new trial. 541\nDiscussion:\nI proposed to essentially create a rule for victims to assert error, leaving additional details to be treated elsewhere. The\nAdvisory Committee proposed to fold into the Rules of Criminal Procedure some of the enforcement provisions and restrictions\nin the CVRA.\nBecause the Advisory Committee's proposal largely tracks the CVRA, much in it is unobjectionable. But the Advisory\nCommittee deviates from the CVRA's language in five places for reasons that are unexplained - and unexplainable. The patient\nreader of this Article may not be surprised that all five of these deviations operate in the same direction - to reduce a crime\nvictim's rights from what Congress has commanded.\n540\nCassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 921-22.\n541\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60(b), at 16-18.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *959\nPage 70 of 78\nFirst, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(1), the Advisory Committee has watered down the CVRA's directive that a court must decide any\nvictim's motion \"forthwith\" 542 to \"promptly.\" While there is nothing wrong with this change as a matter of style, 543 it does\nappear to reduce the speed with which courts will have to act to enforce victims' rights. \"Forthwith\" can be interpreted to be\nmore exacting requirement than \"promptly.\" 544 Given that the Advisory Committee's premise that, where possible, it \"should\nincorporate\" the language of the CVRA, 545 it is unclear why it chose to substitute \"promptly\" for the \"forthwith\" requirement.\nSecond, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(2), the Advisory Committee has inexplicably left out the right of the victim's representative to\nassert a victim's right (along with [*960] the victim herself and the prosecutor). 546 This omission is criticized earlier in this\nArticle. 547\nThird, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(5)(a) through (c), the Advisory Committee sets out three requirements for a victim to file a\nmotion to reopen a sentence - requirements taken straight from the CVRA. 548 Without explanation, however, the Advisory\nCommittee then leaves out the CVRA's qualification to these restrictions - \"this paragraph does not affect the victim's right to\nrestitution as provided in Title 18, United States Code.\" 549\nFourth, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(4), the Advisory Committee has left out the CVRA's venue provision which allows a victim to\nassert her rights \"if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred.\" 550 In contrast\nto the other three omissions just noted, the Advisory Committee specifically discussed whether to track the italicized language\nin its proposed rule on asserting rights. Remarkably, it decided to take the statutory language out of the Rules:\nJudge Levi expressed concern over the final phrase in Rule [60(b)(4)], which gives a victim the right to assert rights \"if no\nprosecution is underway, in the court in the district in which the crime occurred.\" Judge Jones said the Crime Victims Rights\nAct affords victims certain rights even in the absence of a case. Judge Levi noted, however, that the criminal rules only apply to\nproceedings in filed cases. Judge Jones explained that the subcommittee had decided to include it because there might be a preprosecution\nproceeding of some sort to which the provision might apply. There was discussion as to whether a grand jury\ninvestigation might qualify as such. Professor Beale said that, while the Act might give victims certain rights, such as being\ntreated respectfully, Judge Levi was probably correct that the rights covered by the criminal rules could only be asserted with\nrespect to a case being prosecuted. After further discussion, Judge Jones said the phrase would be deleted, as Judge Levi had\nsuggested. 551\n542\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3).\n543\nSee Bryan A.

Rev. 861, *960\nPage 71 of 78\nThis resulted in the Advisory Committee proposing a rule that recites only half of the CVRA's venue provision. The rule as\nproposed by the Advisory Committee provides that \"the rights described in [the rules] must be asserted in [*961] the district in\nwhich a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime,\" 552 leaving silent what a victim should do if no prosecution is underway.\nOnce again, the confusion that the Advisory Committee discovered in the statute stems from the committee's failure to give\neffect to (among other things) the victim's right to fairness. The CVRA extends the requirement for fair treatment not only to\nprosecutors and courts, but also to all \"officers and employees of the Department of Justice and other departments and agencies\nof the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime … .\" 553 (I will call this the CVRA's\n\"coverage provision.\") It is, of course, easily conceivable that investigative agencies might violate a victim's right to fairness\nbefore formal criminal proceedings were initiated. Because \"no prosecution is underway\" in such circumstances, the victim\nwould need to assert their rights (in the language of the CVRA's venue provision) \"in the district court in the district in which\nthe crime occurred.\"\nUnder the Advisory Committee's proposal, a victim who is treated unfairly by a federal investigative agency will lack any place\nto assert her right to fair treatment - in contravention of a teaching that traces back at least to Marbury v. Madison that \"where\nthere is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy.\" 554 The Advisory Committee, however, seems to think that this is not a\nproblem to be addressed in the Rules because the rights covered by the criminal rules \"could only be asserted with respect to a\ncase being prosecuted.\" But, of course, this assumption depends on limiting the rights in the CVRA to such narrow provisions\nas the right to be \"heard\" on sentencing and other issues, because these rights attach only to \"any public proceeding.\" 555 This\nassumption fails if the right to be treated fairly (not to mention the right to be treated with dignity and respect and other rights)\nis in the mix - as CVRA's plain language demands.\nThe Advisory Committee seemed to recognize the venue problem for cases with no prosecution underway when it discussed\nthe fact that victims may now have rights in the grand jury process (a subject squarely covered by the criminal rules 556 ). But\nother examples exist as well. For example, federal agents may improperly tread on a victim's rights through a search warrant\n(another subject covered by the criminal rules 557 ). Or in the course of their investigation, they may mishandle evidence in a\nway that treads on a victim's dignity (improperly disseminating a nude or pornographic photograph of a victim, for instance.\n558 ) In [*962] all these situations, victims are at least entitled to a forum to assert their rights to be treated with fairness and\nwith respect for their dignity and privacy - yet the Advisory Committee has excised the CVRA's venue provision that provides\nthe forum.\n552\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, Rule 60(b)(4), at 17.\n553\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n554\n5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 (1803).\n555\n18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4).\n556\nFed.

Sept. 21, 2004) (finding no § 1983 right to damages for\nalleged mishandling of nude photograph during state police investigation).\nThe examples given in the text are just illustrations, and there may be many more situations where a victim's rights might be violated before\ncharges are filed. In particular, the victim might not receive notice of their rights before charges are filed. The Justice Department's own\nguidelines provide that a victim must receive notice of rights \"at the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at which it may be done\nwithout interfering with an investigation.\" Dep't of Justice, Attorney General Guidelines, supra note 161, at 23. Moreover, existing federal\nlaw requires the same notification, although this law is found outside the CVRA. See 42 U.S.C. § 10607 (notice to victim must be given at\n\"the earliest opportunity after the detection of a crime at which it may be done without interfering with an investigation.\").\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *962\nPage 72 of 78\nIt is important to emphasize one argument the Advisory Committee does not appear to make: that the CVRA applies only to\ncharged crimes. Any such argument would not only fly squarely in the face of the CVRA's venue and coverage provisions\napplying victims' rights against investigating agencies, but also of the CVRA's clear legislative history. Discussing the CVRA's\ndefinition of a crime victim, 559 Senator Kyl said the statute used an \"intentionally broad definition because all victims of\ncrime deserve to have their rights protected, whether or not they are the victim of the count charged.\" 560\nAt least one federal magistrate judge has suggested, in dicta, that - in spite of Senator Kyl's plain statement - the CVRA might\nnot apply until charges have been filed. 561 His primary reason for doing so, however, was that the Supreme Court's decision in\nHughey v. United States, 562 suggested this result. To be sure, the victims statute at issue in Hughey (the Victim Witness\nProtection Act) did employ a similar definition of \"victim\" as that found in the CVRA. But Hughey turned on the fact that other\nlanguage in the restitution statute provided that \"\"a defendant convicted of an offense' may be ordered to \"make restitution to\nany victim of such offense.'\" 563 Such a straightforward holding says little about a statute - such as the \"fairness\" provision in\nthe CVRA - that contains no such limiting language regarding persons \"convicted … of [an] offense.\" Moreover, the magistrate\njudge did not discuss the CVRA's coverage and venue provisions, which plainly dictate that the CVRA applies to crimes not yet\ncharged. For all these reasons, the [*963] Advisory Committee should apply the CVRA as written and include a venue\nprovision both for prosecuted and not-yet-prosecuted crimes.\nFifth, and most important, in proposed Rule 60(b)(2), the Advisory Committee gives victims the power to assert rights \"under\nthese rules.\" As has been noted throughout this Article, the Rules as they would be amended by the Advisory Committee leave\nout many of the victims' rights under the CVRA. For example, the victims right to a speedy trial has not been included in the\nproposed rule changes. 564 By giving victims the power to only assert the limited number of rights listed \"under these rules,\"\nthe Advisory Committee ignores many victims' rights under the CVRA. At the very least, the language should be changed to\nmake clear that victims to assert all rights that they have under the CVRA.\nOne change that the Advisory Committee should not make is worth brief mention: The Advisory Committee should not add a\nprovision for a fact-finding hearing to determine whether someone is a \"victim\" of crime. In its comment on the pending\nproposed amendments, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (\"NACDL\") has proposed such a procedure.\nThe rationale it gives is that \"the conferring of \"rights' on the \"victim' comes, in general, at the expense of the defendant. Thus,\ndue process requires that a provision be added to these Rules for a factfinding hearing, to be held whenever the proper labeling\nof a person as \"victim,' is in dispute … .\" 565\nThe NACDL's rationale is patently defective. The rights in the CVRA do not interfere with any rights of the defendant, as\npointed out throughout this Article. 566 For instance, for victims to be notified of court hearings, to attend those hearings, and\n559\nSee supra notes 117-133 and accompanying text (discussing amendments to Rule 1).\n560\n150 Cong.

Utah\n2006) (\"Although some of the other rights in the Crime Victims' Rights Act (such as the right to be heard and the right to not be excluded) are\nlimited to \"public proceedings,' the right to fairness is not so restricted.\").\n561\nUnited States v.

Defense Lawyers Before the Advisory Comm. on Criminal Rules 4\n(Jan. 26, 2007).\n566\nWhile the CVRA extends to uncharged crimes, it is also obvious that \"the CVRA does not grant victims any rights against individuals who\nhave not been convicted of a crime.\" In re W.R. Huff Asset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 564 (2d Cir. 2005) (emphasis added); accord Searcy v.\nSkinner, No. 6:06-1418-GRA-WMC, 2006 WL 1677177, at 2 (D.S.C. June 16, 2006). Like the constitutional amendment it was patterned on,\nthe CVRA extends rights against the government - that is, rights \"not to be victimized again through the process by which government\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *963\nPage 73 of 78\nto speak at those hearings does not interfere with the defendant's right to be notified of those hearings, attend those hearings,\nand to speak at those hearings. Perhaps this is why the NACDL could only assert that \"in general\" victims' rights harm\ndefendants - the NACDL did not provide a single supporting example.\nMoreover, the procedure that the NACDL would put in place - a full evidentiary hearing with the defendant able to crossexamine\nthe victim to be determine \"victim\" status - is novel and unwarranted. While crime victims' rights have existed in all\nfifty states and the federal system for the last two decades, no [*964] jurisdiction has ever required anything like this. 567\nInstead, procedural issues of how to determine victim status are left to the sound discretion of the trial courts.\nTo give a defendant an automatic right to challenge victim status raises constitutional and other problems. A defendant who\nsimply complained about a victim designation would lack \"standing\" under Article III of the Constitution, because there would\nbe no \"threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action.\" 568 Moreover, to give defendants free license to\ncross-examine victims about whether they were truly victims would obviously create a right to discovery in a criminal case that\ncontradicts current law 569 and circumvents the stringent limitations on depositions of witnesses found in Rule 15. 570 The\npotential for abusive questioning of victims in such hearings (where no jury is present to be alienated) should also not be\noverlooked. 571 The victims' rights provisions in this country have never been used to give defendants new rights to question\nand potentially traumatize victims. The CVRA's expansion of victims' rights should not be the occasion to start. 572\nV. Conclusion\nThis Article has tried to make the case for specific changes to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to protect crime\nvictims' rights, particularly those rights listed in the CVRA. The Article has attempted to sketch out one way that the Rules\ncould be amended to do this while at the same time contending that the Advisory Committee's pending victims' rights proposals\nare too restrictive. In concluding the Article, it may be useful to raise broader concerns about the Advisory Committee's\nminimalist approach.\nIn reviewing the Advisory Committee's proposals, some might reach the conclusion that the Committee treated the victims\nissue as a chore to be survived rather than an opportunity to be seized. One can read the Committee's proposals and the minutes\nof its discussions without finding much enthusiasm for the idea of crime victims becoming a part of the criminal justice\nprocess. This reluctance may be part of a larger phenomenon of hostility by the legal culture to crime victims, as other scholars\nand I have argued elsewhere. 573\nofficials prosecute, punish and release accused or convicted offenders.\" Tribe & Cassell, supra note 28; accord S. Rep. 106-254, at 1-2 (2000)\n(Victims' Rights Amendment designed to guarantee victims participatory rights in government process). That is why the CVRA states that the\nrights must be afforded by government agencies and actors. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (2006).\n567\nCommunication from Professor Douglas Beloof, Director of the National Crime Victims Law Institute (Jan. 19, 2007) (on file with\nauthor).\n568\nWarth v.

See infra note 580.\n573\nSee, e.g., Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 534 (\"The \"legal culture' … is one that has not made room for crime victims.\");\nEdna Erez, Victim Participation in Sentencing: And the Debate Goes On … , 3 Int'l Rev. of Victimology 17, 29 (1994) (noting socialization\nof legal scholars \"in a culture and structure that do not recognize the victim as a legitimate party in criminal proceedings\"); see also Stephanos\nBibas, Transparency and Participation in Criminal Procedure, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 911, 964 (2006) (suggesting crime victims can effectively\nmonitor the behavior of \"insiders\" in the system).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *964\nPage 74 of 78\n[*965] Any lack of interest in crime victims is regrettable and might lead to harmful consequences. Congress has decided that\ncrime victims must be fully integrated into the federal criminal justice system. The Rules of Criminal Procedure are an\nimportant part of that system and must fully reflect the congressionally protected interests of crime victims. If the judiciary will\nnot do the job, no doubt Congress will step in to finish the task. Indeed, Congress will be looking carefully at the CVRA's\neffectiveness in changing the system in 2008, as it directed the General Accounting Office to \"prepare and submit to the\nappropriate committees a report\" on the effectiveness of the act at that time. 574\nIt would be unfortunate if initiative for rules on crime victims were to pass from the courts to Congress. The courts do have\ninstitutional advantages in assessing changes in the Rules. 575 The rulemaking committees are staffed with judges who have\nlong experience in applying rules of procedure. And the rulemaking process itself guarantees considerable public involvement\nand careful deliberation about any rules that are ultimately adopted.\nBut having a good rulemaking process is one thing; producing a good product is another. Unfortunately, the Advisory\nCommittee's current proposals do not treat crime victims fairly and, even more indisputably, do not fully implement Congress's\ncommands in the CVRA. As the CVRA directs, crime victims are now participants in the federal criminal justice system. The\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure must faithfully reflect that new reality and ensure that crime victims, no less than\nprosecutors and defendants, are treated fairly throughout the process.\nVI. Afterword\nAfter this Article was completed in January 2007, several significant developments occurred that are relevant to rule changes\ndiscussed here. First, several members of Congress wrote the Advisory Committee to explain that they were concerned about\nthe timid approach to implementing the CVRA. Then, in the spring and summer of 2007, the Advisory Committee itself made\nseveral changes to the Rules discussed in this Article. Finally, as anticipated in the conclusion to this Article, Congress has\nbegun to move on legislation that would finish the task of enshrining crime victims' rights in the federal rules. Rather than\nrevise the Article in light of these subsequent developments, it seemed to make more sense to let the Article stand as originally\nwritten and supplement it with a brief afterward discussing each of these developments.\n[*966]\nA. Congressional Public Comment on the Advisory Committee's Proposed Rules\nPublic comment on the Advisory Committee's proposed rule changes closed in February 2007. As comment was closing,\nseveral members of Congress wrote the Committee, confirming that they too are troubled by the minimalist approach to the\nproposed CVRA amendments. On February 15, 2007, Senator Jon Kyl wrote to the Committee to express his \"strong concern\"\nabout the proposed amendments. He explained as follows:\nAs a sponsor of the Act, I believe that passage by overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate signifies\nCongress's intent to provide crime victims with substantive rights and protections in federal court. But the proposed\namendments do little more than reiterate limited parts of the statute. Crime victims have been mistreated by the federal\ncriminal justice system for far too long. To comply with Congress's intent, the Advisory Committee must take decisive and …\ncomprehensive action to thoroughly amend the rules and fully ensure that crime victims are protected in federal courts. 576\nSenator Kyl went on to say he \"fully endorsed\" my specific proposals, indicating that they were, however, in some areas \"too\ncautious.\" 577\nB.

Rev. 861, *966\nPage 75 of 78\nIn response to this Article and to other public criticisms of its rules, the Advisory Committee made several modest changes to\nits proposed rules. These changes are discussed in numerical order here. Other than these changes, no significant changes were\nmade to the proposed rules discussed here. The Advisory Committee has submitted them all to the Supreme Court and, unless\nthe Court takes the unusual step of disavowing them, they will go into effect on December 1, 2008.\nRule 1. In apparent response to my criticism that the definition of \"victim\" found in Rule 1 intentionally excluded a victim's\n\"representative,\" 578 on April 16, 2007, the Advisory Committee amended its proposed Rule 60 to allow a victim's\nrepresentative to assert a right. Rule 60(b)(2) now provides: \"A victim's rights described in these rules may be asserted by the\nvictim, the victim's lawful representative, the attorney for the government, or any other person as authorized [*967] by 18\nU.S.C. § 3771(d) and (e).\" 579 This change insures that victims' representatives will be able to assert victims' rights. The\nAdvisory Committee also added language to the Committee Note stating that courts could make appropriate findings to resolve\nany dispute about who is a victim. 580\nRule 5. At its October 1, 2007 meeting in Utah, the Advisory Committee approved a proposed change to Rule 5 regarding\ndetention hearings. The proposed addition to Rule 5 reads: \"In making the decision to detain or release the defendant, the judge\nmust consider the right of the victim to be reasonably protected from the defendant.\" 581 This language was lifted almost\nstraight from Senator Kyl's proposed legislation implementing the CVRA 582 (which is discussed in the next section). This\nseems like a valuable addition to the Rules, helping to protect victims' rights in detention decisions.\nRule 12.1. At its April 16, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee apparently agreed with my conclusion that courts lack\nauthority to force a victim to meet with a defendant 583 and struck language recommending such a meeting from its Committee\nnote. 584\nRule 12.3. Also at its October 1, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee responded to my point that the same language appears\nin both Rule 12.1 (alibi defense) and Rule 12.3 (public authority defense) regarding disclosure of addresses of crime victims.\n585 It therefore proposed to add the same changes to Rule 12.3 that it added to Rule 12.1. 586 Unfortunately, for the reasons\ndiscussed at length here, now the language in both Rule 12.1 and 12.3 is insufficiently protective of victims' rights. 587\nRule 17. At its April 16, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee revised its rule on subpoenas for confidential information to\nread: \"Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require that notice be given to\nthe victim so that the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" 588 This change responds to\nobjections from the American Bar Association, other groups, and me that the earlier rule encouraged ex parte [*968] issuance\n578\nSee supra notes 117-126 and accompanying text.\n579\nProposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60(b)(2), at 17 (emphasis added).\n580\nMemorandum from Hon.

Rev. 861, *968\nPage 76 of 78\nof subpoenas for confidential information and thus violated important due process principles. 589 The new rule is an\nimprovement, in that it limits ex parte procedures to \"exceptional circumstances.\" The Committee note then offers two\nillustrations of exceptional circumstances. One is unobjectionable - where \"evidence … might be lost or destroyed if the\nsubpoena were delayed\" 590 - a standard exigent circumstance that justifies moving rapidly. But the other illustration - \"a\nsituation where the defense would be unfairly prejudiced by premature disclosure of a sensitive defense strategy\" 591 - remains\nquite problematic, for reasons discussed earlier. 592\nRule 21. Also at its October 1, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee approved a very modest change to Rule 21(b), regarding\ntransfer of cases for convenience. The change reads:\nRule 21. Transfer for Trial\n… .\n(b) For Convenience. Upon the defendant's motion, the court may transfer the proceeding, or one or more counts, against that\ndefendant to another district for the convenience of the parties, and victim, and the witnesses, and in the interests of justice.\nThis change is modest, because (in my estimation) relatively few federal cases involving victims are transferred for\n\"convenience\" under Rule 21(b). The more common situation is transfers for prejudice under Rule 21(a). 593 Thus, this change\nis, at best, relatively inconsequential.\nIn any event, the change is defective. While the proposed rule lets the judge consider the victim's interest in determining\nwhether to transfer, the Advisory Committee did not adopt my recommendation to let crime victims be heard on transfer\ndecisions. 594 Without a mechanism for passing victim information along to the judge, an instruction to the judge to consider\nthe victims' interest is essentially meaningless. The Advisory Committee should remedy this defect by giving victims the right\nto be heard on transfer decisions.\nRule 32. In possible response to my point that victims deserve the right to be \"heard\" at sentencing hearings by speaking\ndirectly to the judge, 595 on April 16, 2007, the Advisory Committee modified its note to Rule 32(i)(4). The note now reads:\n\"Absent unusual circumstances, any victim who is present should be [*969] allowed a reasonable opportunity to speak\ndirectly to the judge.\" 596 While this is an improvement over earlier language, it still remains unclear what sorts of \"unusual\ncircumstances\" the Advisory Committee has in mind that would permit a judge to deny a victim her right under the CVRA to\nspeak. It is also odd that the Advisory Committee Note would apparently allow a judge to exclude a victim in some\ncircumstances, when the only two reported decisions on the issue have held directly to the contrary that victims have an\nunequivocal right to speak to the judge. 597\nRule 60. In response to public comments, the Advisory Committee made several modest changes to Rule 60. Rule 60(a)(2) was\nrevised to make clear that the duty to permit full attendance arises in the context of the victim's possible exclusion. 598 As\n589\nSee supra notes 347-351 and accompanying text.\n590\nBucklew Memo, supra note 580, app. a, at 282.\n591\nId.\n592\nSee supra notes 249-257 and accompanying text.\n593\nSee, e.g., supra notes 366-382 and accompanying text (discussing transfer for prejudice in two cases).\n594\nSee supra note 366 and accompanying text.\n595\nSee supra notes 434-448 and accompanying text.\n596\nBeale Memo, supra note 580, app. at 7.\n597\nSee Kenna v.

The Last Word? Legislation to Fully Implement the CVRA\nUnsatisfied with the timid approach taken by the Advisory Committee on the CVRA, Senator Jon Kyl introduced legislation to\ncomprehensively amend the federal rules on June 29, 2007. Senator Kyl explained that the Advisory Committee's amendments\n\"do little more than reiterate limited parts of the statute.\" 600 Agreeing with the major premise of this Article - that crime\nvictims must be treated fairly in the criminal justice process - Senator Kyl noted: \"Of particular importance, the CVRA\nguaranteed that crime victims would have the right to be treated with \"fairness.' My proposed amendments would add to the\nFederal rules the changes needed to treat crime victims fairly.\" 601 Senator Kyl was also concerned about delay by the\nAdvisory Committee in moving forward with comprehensive amendments:\nCongress enacted the CVRA in October 2004. In the almost 3 years since then, I have waited patiently to give the federal courts\nthe first opportunity to review the need for rule changes. At the same time, though, I have made clear my position, as one of the\ncosponsors of the CVRA, that Congress expected significant reforms in the Federal rules. As I explained to my colleagues at\nthat time, the crime victims' [*970] community in this country was looking to the CVRA to serve as a model for the states and\na formula to fully protect crime victims. 602\nAccordingly, Senator Kyl proposed a long string of direct amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to\ncomprehensively protect victims' rights.\nSome of the legislation that Senator Kyl proposed tracked my proposals in this Article. For example, he proposed amendments\nto a number of rules - including Rules 2, 10.1, 603 11(b)(4), 11(c)(1), 11(c)(2), 12.1, 12.3, 15, 21(e), 32(f)(1), 32(h), 43.1, 44,\n46, and 50( c) - largely tracking my proposals.\nBut other proposed changes went well beyond those I propose here. For example, Senator Kyl proposed changing Rule 4's\nprovision dealing with execution of arrest warrants to require reasonable efforts to give notice to victims about the initial\nappearance of an arrested suspect. 604 Along the same lines, Senator Kyl would give victims reasonable notice of any decision\nto release a defendant at the initial appearance 605 as well as notice of any pretrial conference. 606 He also would give federal\nprosecutors authority to release to a victim any discovery materials that have been released to the defendant. 607 To assist non-\nEnglish speaking crime victims, he proposes to give the courts authority to appoint an interpreter for the victim. 608 Senator\nKyl's bill would also require disclosure to the victim of any presentence report \"except any portion of such report excised by\nthe court for compelling reasons or made confidential by law.\" 609 And his bill would require that the victim be given a\nreasonable opportunity to be heard before any motion for a new trial is granted. 610\n599\nSee supra notes 117-126 and accompanying text.\n600\n153 Cong.

But what is certain is that congressional\ninterest in crime victims' rights will remain strong. Congress has been working on far reaching crime victims' rights legislation\nfor several decades now and, indeed, many in Congress favor an amendment to the United States Constitution to protect\nvictims' rights. 611 Against that backdrop, it is unlikely that Congress will permit the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to\nonly haphazardly protect victims' rights. If the Advisory Committee does not complete the task of comprehensively reforming\nthe Rules to protect victims, Congress almost certainly will - and should - finish the job.\nUtah Law Review\nCopyright (c) 2007 Utah Law Review Society\nEnd of Document\n611\nSee supra notes 30-35 and accompanying text.\nDAVID SCHOEN",
