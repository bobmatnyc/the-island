Some\n\nhistorians say that as many as 2 million German women might have been raped.\n\n#25 ‘Leap Into Freedom’\n\na\n\nImage source: TIME\n\nAfter post-war Berlin was divided into four occupation zones, the living conditions were greatly different in each one.\nBetween 1949 and 1961, about 2.5 million people fled from Soviet-occupied East Germany. Barricades and barb wire was\nplaced to stop people from fleeing but that did not stop 19-year-old border guard Hans Conrad Schumann. A crown in\nWest Berlin was enticing the young soldier to come over. The soldier said he did not want to “live enclosed,” and jumped\nthe barbed wire, escaping into the West side. The photo was considered a symbol of freedom but Hans did not deal with\n\nthe newly-found fame well — he committed suicide in 1998.\n\n#26 ‘D-Day’\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020692",
