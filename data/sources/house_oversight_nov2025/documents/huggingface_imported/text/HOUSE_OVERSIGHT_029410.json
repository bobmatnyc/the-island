She said Mr. Epstein had masturbated as she massaged him, had\npressed a vibrator against her underwear and had given her $300 afterward.\n\nIn October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr.\nEpstein had routinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then\ninterviewed a total of 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar\nstories about what they had observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein’s home.\nAccording to the report, at least one said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse\nwith her.\n\nMr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with\nMr. Epstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown\nup for grand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie-detector test\nclearing him of any sexual involvement with under-age girls.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police\nwent to Mr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029410",
