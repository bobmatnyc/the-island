  "text": "?\n\nbetween Sunnis and Alawites in Syria would profoundly disturb the\nwhole region, creating a nightmare scenario for Washington and\nother Western capitals.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington seems at a loss as to how to respond to the\ngrowing unrest in Syria. In tempered language, the administration has\ncondemned the use of violence against civilians and encouraged\npolitical reform. But the undertones are evident: Stability in Syria\nmay still preferable to yet another experiment in Arab governance.\nAssad will need to act quickly and decisively -- and one hopes not\nharshly -- to quell the rising current of dissent. Indeed, Secretary of\nState Hillary Clinton seemed to offer the regime some modest support\nthis weekend, noting that she believed Bashar to be a \"reformer.\" But\nreform has never been a primary goal of the Assad clan, which has\nlong favored stability over change.\n\nThis edifice may now be crumbling, and the United States would be\nwise to spend a little less time thinking about Libya and a little more\ntime thinking about a state that truly has implications on U.S.\nnational interests. If things go south in Syria, blood-thirsty sectarian\ndemons risk being unleashed, and the entire region could be\nconsumed in an orgy of violence.\n\nPatrick Seale is a British writer who specializes in Middle East\n\naffairs. His latest book is The Struggle for Arab Independence: Riad\nel-Solh and the Makers of the Modern Middle East.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030036",
