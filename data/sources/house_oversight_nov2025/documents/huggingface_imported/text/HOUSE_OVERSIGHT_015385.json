  "text": "his girlfriend.” Robin and | were sitting next to each other, and we\nsimultaneously crossed that joke off our imaginary lists.\n\nThere were short-jokes galore. Have a few free samples: “Short? |\ncarry a life-sized portrait of Harlan in my wallet.” “Harlan’ s parents\nwere normal, but the milkman was a syphilitic dwarf.” And the producer\nof Twilight Zone, Phil de Guere, complained, “It took Harlan nine months\nbefore he figured out how to shoot himself in the foot at 7wilight Zone\nand get canned. But of all the people | have worked with, Harlan is by far\nthe shortest. Harlan doesn’ t have a short fuse. He /sa short fuse.”\n\nMy own short-joke was, “Actually, this isn’ t a roast. It’ s more like\na microwave.” Robin said, “Harlan is a tall Paul Williams, a white Paul\nSimon.” | pointed out that “Harlan is on the right side of a lot of\nimportant fights. He’ s fought against racism and sexism. That’ s why this\nwhole panel is white males.”\n\nA roast by definition overflows with irreverence, insults, and\nraunchiness. Examples: “If it’ s true that you are what you eat, Harlan\nwould be a vagina.” Stan Lee of comic-book infamy said, “Harlan is a\nvery difficult person to arouse. Ask any of his former wives.” And Robin\ncontributed a metaphorical dick joke: “If you’ re hung like a field mouse,\n\ndon’ t stand in the wind.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015385",
