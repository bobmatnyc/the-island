(rule 1)\nY VY > & is the same as AS > BY (rule 2 twice)\nB&> AY is the same as 8 » V (rule 3)\n\nAny collection of symbols will do. The symbols have no meaning\nin themselves other than the meaning we have given them. A tribe in\nthe Amazon jungle could demonstrate a proof without knowing any\nmathematics. All I need say is, “Hey, I want to play a game with you. Can\nanyone make this into that, in the fewest possible steps, while obeying\nthese rules?”\n\nBut, is it true we can ignore the meaning behind the symbols. Does\nit matter that we were talking of numbers rather than spears, counters, or\ncrocodiles? If we look at the marathon winning analogy again, we know\nthe nature of a game is important. In a running race we can interpret\nholding hands to mean the two athletes are treated as one, the existing\nrules can then be applied as normal and the pair become a single winner.\nBut, in tennis, there would be a problem. I wouldn't want to come on court\nand find I’m playing against two opponents! On consideration though\nId be happy if they had to hold hands while they played so that they\nconstituted a single player. When we examine the actual circumstances,\nwe can add a rule and show the rule works, but we have to see something\nabout the specific sport that makes the rule fair and workable.\n\nHilbert was convinced mathematical truth is not like this and\nthat proofs follow from the rulebook without any knowledge of the\ncircumstances, i.e., the sport being played or any other analogous thing.\nHe was to be proven wrong by Kurt Gédel.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015891",
