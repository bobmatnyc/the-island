  "text": "Palestinian feelings cut across most, if not all, opposition groups. It 1s\na singular, unifying force that might suffice to break the military's\npower, or at least to force the military to shift its Israeli policy.\nHamas in conflict with Israel as the United Nations votes for a\nPalestinian state also places Fatah on the political defensive among\nthe Palestinians. Fatah cooperation with Israel while Gaza is at war\nwould undermine Fatah, possibly pushing Fatah to align with Hamas.\nHaving the U.N. vote take place while Gaza is at war, a vote possibly\naccompanied by General Assembly condemnation of Israel, could\nredefine the region.\n\nLast week's attack on the Eilat road should be understood in this\ncontext. Some are hypothesizing that new Islamist groups forming in\nthe Sinai or Palestinian groups in Gaza operating outside Hamas'\ncontrol carried out the attack. But while such organizations might\nformally be separate from Hamas, I find it difficult to believe that\nHamas, with an excellent intelligence service inside Gaza and among\nthe Islamist groups in the Sinai, would not at least have known these\ngroups’ broad intentions and would not have been in a position to\nstop them. Just as Fatah created Black September in the 1970s, a\ngroup that appeared separate from Fatah but was in fact covertly part\nof it, the strategy of creating new organizations to take the blame for\nconflicts is an old tactic both for the Palestinians and throughout the\nworld.\n\nHamas' ideal attack would offer it plausible deniability - allowing it\nto argue it did not even know an attack was imminent, much less\ncarry it out - and trigger an Israeli attack on Gaza. Such a scenario\ncasts Israel as the aggressor and Hamas as the victim, permitting\nHamas to frame the war to maximum effect in Egypt and among the\nPalestinians, as well as in the wider Islamic world and in Europe.\nRegional Implications and Israel's Dilemma\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031921",
