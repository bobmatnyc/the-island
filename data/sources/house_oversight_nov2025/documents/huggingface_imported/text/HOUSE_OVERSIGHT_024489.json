  "text": "The Projections do not assume that the Company will make any future material acquisitions, even though\nthe Company expects fo use the proceeds of the sale of the Units, among other purposes, for\nacquisitions, which will likely affect actual performance and cause it to differ from the Projections. The\nProjections assume the success of the Company's operating strategy, although no assurance can be\ngiven that the Company's strategy will be effective or that the anticipated benefits from the strategy will be\nrealized in the periods for which the Projections have been prepared. The assumptions described herein\nare those that the Company believes are most significant to the Projections; however, not all assumptions\nused in preparing the Projections have been set forth herein.\n\nThe Projections, in general, assume that: (i) the Company will not be negatively or positively impacted by\nany material legal proceedings; (ii} there will be no material change in any of the Company's existing\ncontracts or leases; (ili) there will be no change in generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.\nthat will have a material effect on the financial results of ihe Company; (iv} there will be no labor disputes,\nnatural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics (such as avian flu) or other disturbances that would\nmaterially affect the operations or revenues of the Company; and (v) that worldwide economic conditions\nand economic conditions in the U.S. remain generally favorable and consistent with those prevailing on\nthe date of this Memorandum.\n\nThe Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered\nreasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive\nrisks, uncertainties and contingencies which are beyond the control of KLC, and upon assumptions with\nrespect to future business decisions which are subject to change. Accordingly, the Projections are only\nan estimate, and actual results will vary from the Projections, and these variations may be material.\nConsequently, the inclusion of the Projections herein should not be regarded as a representation of the\nCompany, its advisors, the Agents, or any other person of results that will actually be achieved.\nProjections are necessarily specuiative in nature, and it is usually the case that one or more of the\nassumptions in projections do not materialize. Prospective purchasers of the Units are cautioned not to\nplace undue reliance on the Projections.\n\nThe limited 412 projections contained in this Memorandum were received from k12 management and\nwere not prepared by the Company or its management.\n\nThe Company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to reflect circumstances\nexisting after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that\nany or all of the underlying assumptions do not come to fruition. Furthermore, the Company does not\nintend to updaie or revise the Projections to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions.\n\n6.4. Risks Related to Investing in the Units\n\n6.4.1. There will be significant unallocated net proceeds from the offering\n\nlf there are additional closings after the initial closing of the offering, after repayment of KUE’s debt, a\nsignificant amount of the anticipated net proceeds from the offering of the Units may not have been\ndesignated for specific uses. Therefore, the Company's management will have broad discretion within\nthe business scope of the Company with respect to the use of the net proceeds of the offering. There can\nbe no assurance that the uses of proceeds will benefit the Company or investors.\n\n6.4.2 Investors will only have limited rights to receive ongoing information about the\nCompany\n\nOther than as expressly provided in the Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE (the “Limited Partnership\nAgreement\"), the Company does not expect fo provide ongoing detailed information regarding its\n\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations to Investors. The Limited Parinership Agreement\nprovides that Investors shall receive yearly audited financial statements of the Company, as well as semi-\n\n56\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024489",
