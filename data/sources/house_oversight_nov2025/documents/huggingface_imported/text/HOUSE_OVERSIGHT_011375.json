The fact\nthat when asked, \"What did you think of your daughter 17 years\n\nago? Well, I thought at the time that she was a liar,\" wasn't\n\nsomething that goes to Ms. Giuffre's reputation because there's\n\nno evidence anybody knew about it other than, you know, the\nmother who is now being deposed in 2016.\n\nMoreover, the question was, \"What did you think about\n\nthe fact that your then 17-year-old child was running away from\n\nschool? Well, I thought she was lying to me about that.\" That\n\nwould go, I guess, to her reputation back in, what, 1999, 2000,\n\n2001, that time period, but of course the damages that are at\n\nissue in this case are damages around 2016 and thereabouts when\n\nthe defamatory statement is released.\n\nSo it's hard to see even an argument for the statement\n\nof the mom in a deposition going to reputation. I don't know,\n\nmaybe I'm missing something, maybe there's some marginal\n\nrelevance that can be distilled out of all of that. But of\n\ncourse then your Honor has to weigh whatever marginal value\n\nthat has as to reputational issues against the very significant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011375",
