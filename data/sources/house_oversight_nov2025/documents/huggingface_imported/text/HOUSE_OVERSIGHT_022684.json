A detailed review by a team of BuzzFeed News reporters of \nmore than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and federal \ncourt found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are exaggerated at \nbest; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject — themselves never \nsuggest that Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that many of the most lurid \ninsinuations have been floated without any visible support from verifiable information. \nWhile it's still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving Epstein, \nthe fact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should not be \nencouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst. \nOne sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been \nmarkedly vague on details. \nWhen asked to present actual proof, Jack Scarola, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing \ndocuments that have come to light in recent weeks, warned darkly in an email of \"extortionate threats, power, wealth or political \npressure.\" \n\"The time will come when all your questions will be answered,\" said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in \nPalm Beach County Court. \"But that time is not now.\" \nUnwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the Atlantic have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish \nbreathless descriptions of Epstein's \"black book,\" which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every other \npowerful figure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier's private 727 aircraft that frequently \ncapture Bubba at 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein's sex slave as \na teenager and whose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on \"Orgy Island\" in 2002 to participate in a sexual romp, \npossibly with women who were not yet of age. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022686 \nYORK & 'ORGY ISLAND,' SAYS TEEN SEX SLAVE \nView this image > \nNational Enquirer \nTellingly, many of those articles — which have notably increased in tempo in recent weeks following Roberts' late December \naccusation that noted attorney Alan Dershowitz was one of the men she was forced to have sex with — contain language \nunderscoring the fact that none of this proves anything. \"It should at this stage be stressed that the Mail has no evidence to \ncorroborate this and other claims made by Virginia Roberts,\" the Daily Mailwrote in April. \"Though her LinkedIn page claims a \ncertificate in Swedish massage, there is no evidence that she ever actually treated Epstein to one,\" Gawker (in the most \nstraightforward and clearest reporting on the documents to date) wrote last week. And the National Enquirer did not appear to rely \non the court record for its conclusions, instead to the interpretation of an unnamed source who noted that \"Bill's name is all over the \nlegal papers, which are chock-full of sordid claims.\" \nClinton's discretion on matters of sexual restraint has attained permanent notoriety, so maybe it's natural to assume that particular \nleopard doesn't change his spots. But at this point, there is simply nothing to back those sordid claims up. \nHere's what we do know: \nJeffrey Epstein is a secretive billionaire financier and Democratic donor who says he never attended college but whose \"background \nis in physics.\" He owns properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, London, and Paris and also owns an island in the U.S. Virgin \nIslands. He has at least two private jets, including the 727. \nHe has known Bill Clinton since about 1995, and his relationship with him grew stronger after he left office. There is no question they \nwere friendly. Epstein's so-called \"black book,\" which is less like something out of the Heidi Fleiss affair and more what most people \nwould call a \"phone directory,\" contains 21 numbers for getting in touch with Clinton, as well as emails and addresses. \nBut that 92-page directory also contains exactly the range of eye-poppingly famous and powerful contacts one might expect of an \nincredibly rich, connected person who owns Manhattan's largest private residence, from Tony Blair to Elie Wiesel to Courtney Love. \nEpstein was long rumored to be a sexual libertine; \"It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do,\" real estate \npersonality Donald Trump of his old friend. \"And many of them are on the younger side.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022687 \n1 \nFlorida Dept of Law Enforcement \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022688 \nIMPORTANT MESSAGE \nroe trfs,„ \nDATE 61 /19 nmE ff.OE '1:-: \nle \"'47 -- ZtiC \nOF \n=3 INLEEI CKeg VC;t7 \nTELEPHONED \t-a---, \tKEASE CALL \nCue TO SEE YOU \tWILL CALL AGAIN \nWANTS TO SEE YOU \tRUSH \nRETURNED YOUR CAII \u000b--We \t:SPECIAL ATTENTION \nI.4 ho... cL le (407e, \nyou A4t.) -ilea cv., \nhohi A., -s_Fecut hi tall. \nSAGX iS Zic a\" ye wfs ot \neirie . --3_scA•zs ci-ee \nee \nlefa/c.i., (ry au \n,r. \nPalm Beach County Court \nEpstein, in his Florida sex offender photo; at right, a phone message to Epstein from a modeling agent offering Russian lessons from \na \"2x8\" year old girl. \nIn 2006, that reputation caught up with him, when he was arrested by the Palm Beach Police on charges of sexually molesting \nnumerous underage girls. Police reports in the court record show that detectives found Epstein regularly paid very young women to \ngive him massages that he turned into sexual encounters. He allegedly had a preference for very young women, whom he carefully \ngroomed into increasingly extreme situations, including what some, including Roberts, allege to be sexual slavery. \nIn total, 40 women were identified as possible victims of sexual abuse by Epstein, many of them teenagers at the time, including \nsome younger than 14 years old. Epstein was originally charged with a variety of crimes, including sexual assault, rape, and witness \ntampering. \nHe avoided most of those charges as well as federal prosecution in late 2007 by agreeing to plead guilty in Florida court, a deal that \nDershowitz, who was one of Epstein's lawyers, helped negotiate along with an all-star legal lineup that interestingly also included \nfamed Clinton-hunter Ken Starr. \nIn the end, Epstein got 18 months in prison for a single count of soliciting an underage prostitute, of which he served 13 months. He \nis now a registered sex offender who lists his primary residence as the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nIn a pleading late last month in federal court, attorneys for Roberts allege that \"Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a \nprovision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution.\" Dershowitz has denied these charges vigorously, calling \nthem \"salacious and false\" and, possibly more importantly, \"completely irrelevant\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022689 \nDespite what some called among the most exhaustive investigations in Palm Beach Police history — which dug up such evidence as \nan Amazon receipt for Epstein's purchase of titles including \"Training With Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Exotic Slaves and Their \nOwners\" — there is nothing in the police record suggesting any other men were involved in Epstein's predatory behavior. \nF \n- pillins Addrew- ' \nJiiirei, Epstein i I \n358 El Illtipa \nPala Bea 33‘40;l;i_al ..,. \ni, • *4-\\.... • -'.4,,,,-,,,..:v \n•-...:. ,i, \n•••4 \n- - • \n.4!/77414/-3.Inext/2434,123 SORTEAtFatiTrae \nYour order of- bet. 0,2005 (Order ID 103-1737010-4505648) \nCity liant \nIN THI5 SH1FMkNT 'A\" tt. .-4.‘'...711.1.* i'S ' .:' - \n,.. - \n1 SM 101: AjtealIstIc Introduction ' I>. ;•••••-'• • • \n:',,,....Wisernan.

One firm bringing some of those cases employed a young lawyer named Bradley \nEdwards, who managed some of the cases. In 2009, a founding partner at the firm, Scott Rothstein, fled the country before \nultimately returning to plead guilty of running a built around recruiting investors to buy stakes in litigation \nsettlements that turned out to be phony. \nAs details of the fraud emerged, Epstein sued Rothstein and Edwards in Palm Beach County Cour, for racketeering, alleging, among \nother things, that they dangled Bill Clinton's association with Epstein as a lure to investors, implying that settlements would be fast \nand sizable. Epstein ultimately dropped his suit in 2012, but by that time, Edwards had countersued for malicious prosecution and \nabuse of process. \nThat cast, along with a claim by Virginia Roberts against the federal government over the 2007 prosecution deal in district court \n(which she filed as a \"Jane Doe\" in 2008), are still pending and are the source of most of the scant information about Clinton that \nhas appeared. Scarola, who in the past over payments to violent leftist Colombian rebels and won \nv( over Morgan Stanley (that was later overturned), is the lawyer bringing the suit in county court in West Palm Beach, while \nPaul Cassell, a former federal judge known for his critical take on mandatory-minimum sentences, mans the federal case four blocks \naway. \nNeither Cassell nor Edwards responded to requests for comment. \nIt is primarily from pleadings in those cases that the press has been getting a glimpse inside the lifestyle of Epstein, and, by \nextension, Clinton. \"Edwards had sound legal basis for believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable information,\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022690 \npart of one pleading reads. Roberts, in her case, alleges that Epstein forced her \"to be sexually exploited by Defendant's adult male \npeers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances,\" which, \nEdwards elsewhere claims, are \"categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into.\" \nPolice reports entered into the record go into stomach-wrenching detail about Epstein's alleged exploits with the girls and women he \nrecruited and paid for massages that became sexual acts, and mention other women participating as well. Epstein's longtime friend, \nthe socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, is accused of taking part, while his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, is described procuring young \nwoman for him. \nBut neither of those women has ever said a word about Clinton being involved. Maxwell, for her part, has never been deposed. She \ncanceled a deposition in 2010, claiming she had to return to England indefinitely due to family illness, but was soon thereafter \nphotographed by Us Weekly at Chelsea Clinton's wedding in Rhinebeck, New York. \nThe father of \nthe bride \"was \nnodding his head \nat guests, but \nyou could tell he From the bling to bi \nwas nervous,\" \nsays a source._____ part was prepped \nIL! \nlite Kline \nFive hundred guests conveni \nWhite—designed, century-ol \nmansion in Rhinebeck for th \nAwaiting out-of-towners? \nfull of goodies including Cher \n• \nView this image \nUs Weekly \nFor her part, Kellen, who won immunity from prosecution along with Epstein in 2007, did sit for a deposition, but repeatedly pleaded \nthe Fifth, refusing to even say if she'd ever even met the former president. \nEpstein's much-discussed flight logs show fairly conclusively that she has. \nA review of the handwritten documents shows Clinton taking 13 trips in Epstein's specially outfitted Boeing 727, including a much-\ndiscussed trip to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. In every single instance, the logs show, Kellen was also on the plane, as \nwas Epstein. That may sound suspicious, except for the fact that Kellen has been described as Epstein's right hand, profoundly \ninvolved in his professional activities as well as personal ones. Indeed, Doug Band, Clinton's personal aide, was on of the \nflights the former president took on Epstein's jet. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022691 \nNT-\n•••• I \nez-v  \n1211A VA* 1Y \nsq ON) )4 2_6-sz. \n2G S2 ''SS  \nView this image \nPalm Beach County Court \nTel(rfrA,Sr. (IfteStorAicV144..4.t.r..Nso•:_____(11 \nwtvgia, 0 I.7 NA' ),Jr.r..<0 12:5 S el) \nSovue ‘11064e Ftir.$ \nSov4v.s nrs rtianw3' \nrcA%J.,44 \n6 \nAmong the other people who most frequently flew with Clinton are Maxwell and Adriana Ross (formerly Adriana Mucinska), another \nEpstein assistant and a former model. The logs also show him flying with former advisor Ira Magaziner, ex-Transportation Secretary \nRodney Slater, and fashion model Naomi Campbell \nThe pilots' documents also leave numerous and — understandably — intriguing questions unanswered: Clinton was on four flights \nwith women identified as only \"Janice\" and \"Jessica,\" who have not been identified; he once flew with a person identified only as \n\"one female\" and also, during part of the trip throughout Africa, a young woman named Chauntae Davies, who appears in Epstein's \nphone directly under the massage category and whose expertise in Swedish massage was described in Gawkey's story mentioning \nher last week. And because the entries are hand-written in a very cramped log form, it's impossible to know if important names \nended up illegible or left out altogether, nor if there are other logs that have not been revealed. \nBut based on what's in the court files, there are no further clues about those flights, other than the testimony and public statements \nof Roberts, who has described the airplane as a kind of high-altitude Gomorrah. What is on the record is a deposition of Larry \nVisoski, one of Epstein's former pilots, who having Clinton on his plane as many as 20 times. When asked, \"Do you remember \nhim being on the airplane with younger girls?\" Visoski replies, simply, \"No.\" \nClinton flew literally around the world with Epstein, traveling from New York to London, to Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, \nMorocco, Portugal, Russia, and throughout Africa. In almost every case, according to cross-referenced information on his speaking \nengagements, Clinton was apparently traveling for professional reasons, and, according to the logs, he never flew with his wealthy \nfriend anywhere near the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nThat does little to bolster statements by Roberts, who in a 2011 conversation with her lawyers (which both New York Post's Page Six \nand described as an \"interview\") claimed Clinton traveled to Epstein's infamous retreat on Little St. James Island in \n2002. \nEarlier this month, it was reported that Roberts is writing a \"tell-all\" memoir about her experiences. In a sworn affidavit filed in court \nlast week, she claimed to have had sex with Epstein, Dershowitz, England's Prince Andrew, and several other men on numerous \noccasions, and portrayed a three-year period ending in 2002 when Epstein passed her off to his friends continually. But, she added, \n\"I have never had sexual relations with Clinton, nor have I claimed to have had such relations. I have never seen him have sexual \nrelations with anyone.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022692 \nI un mu II um autPut cvurytrung CIVUAUSC mai Win imp prevcni IMAM ZiMUNI dULM.C... \n51.

In fact, the logs show all of \nClinton's flights came in 2002 and 2003, with not a single appearance aloft recorded in 2004 or 2005. \nThe closest potential link to Clinton in the period closer to Epstein's fall, the public record suggests, comes from one of his longtime \nconfidants, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. \nThe flight logs indicate Summers flew on Epstein's jet as far back as 1998, but also on April 15, 2004, September 14, 2005, and \nDecember 21, 2005. The final trip came 10 days after Summers got married, and the log for the flight — from Bedford, \nMassachusetts, to the Virgin Islands — shows what appears to be his new bride on board, as well as Ghislaine Maxwell, but not \nEpstein. \nZI \tTcs \teco \tItra \t, —rJc101-cc: \u000bGM _______________V \n2.1 \tI, \tli \t644) \tT )6T \t*il&M, \ttixtrw 44.140. 0wAsLV \nTT---1. \tISC--1, \tit).4 \tZ?=-1 N M L V \n*cl_ \nView this image > \nPalm Beach County Court \nEpstein was a significant donor to Harvard University, of which Summers was president at the time. According to a spokesperson for \nSummers, on a few occasions when Epstein was flying to where Summers was also traveling, he accepted rides on the billionaire's \njet. \nAttorneys in the two cases have attempted to get the court to permit discovery from Clinton himself, but have been stymied by \nmotions from Epstein's lawyers. Court records show they have also tried unsuccessfully to depose Donald Trump, former New Mexico \nGov. Bill Richardson, former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, and magician David Copperfield. Notably, a list of 73 proposed \nwitnesses in Roberts' trial does not include Clinton. \nThe tale of Epstein and his sexual activities is undoubtedly a fascinating, and harrowing, one. But with the star witness in one case \nswearing under oath that she has no such evidence, and everyone else in a position to know keeping their mouths firmly shut, it is at \nthis point extremely difficult to draw even a hazy, crooked, dotted line between Epstein's depredations, in the bedroom or aloft, and \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton. \nBuzzFeed News reporters Alex Campbell, Kyle Blaine, and Megan Apper contributed to this report. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022693 \nKathryn H.
