If that happens, it could open up the 58-year-old\nPalm Beach billionaire to a slew of federal charges involving sex\ncrimes with minors that were set aside by the agreement.\n\nThe motion, filed Monday in federal court in West Palm Beach,\naccuses the U.S. Attorney’s Office of deliberately misleading the\nvictims by telling them the investigation was ongoing, while\nconcealing they had already signed a deal with Epstein.\n\nAccording to the motion, the U.S. Attorney’s Office sent “false\nnotification” letters in January 2008 and May 2008 to the victims\nsaying “(t)his case is currently under investigation” after the\ngovernment had signed the agreement with Epstein in September\n2007.\n\n“The only reason that the (U.S. Attorney's Office) concealed the\nexistence of the non-prosecution agreement from the victims was\nnot to comply with some legal restriction, but rather to avoid a\nfirestorm of public controversy that would have erupted if the\nsweetheart plea deal with a politically connected billionaire had been\nrevealed,” the motion says.\n\nIf Epstein were found guilty on federal charges, statutory penalties\nranged from 10 years to life.\n\nInstead, the sealed pact was part and parcel of Epstein’s\nacceptance of a state plea deal, where he received an 18-month\nsentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting\nprostitution. He served 13 months segregated in a vacant wing of\nthe county stockade and was let out on work release six days a\nweek for up to 16 hours a day.\n\nEdwards and other attorneys fought in court for a year before\nsuccessfully getting the agreement unsealed in September 2009.\nMore than 30 minor girls were identified as Epstein’s victims in the\npact.\n\nhttp://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news /attorneys—-want-jeffrey-epstein-agreement-thrown-out-1338111.html\n\n4/7/11 1:37 PM\n\nPalm Beach, FL\nH: 84° L: 71°\n\nForecast | Set Location Feels Like: 85°\n\n| SEARCH\n\n® Site © Web Web Search by YAHOO!\n\nPALM BEACH ESTATE\n\nwi Pr be © He\n241 La Puerta Way, Palm Beach\n\nExquisitely designed Mediterranean Palm Beach\nwalled estate.\n\nal\n\ncorcoran.com\n\nas\n\nJe\n% 3\nTOWN OF PALM BEACH\n\n\\/ 1911+ CENTENNIAL + 2011 \\/\n\nID Click here for the latest events!
