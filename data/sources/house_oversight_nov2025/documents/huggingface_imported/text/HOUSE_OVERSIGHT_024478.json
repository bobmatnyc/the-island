  "text": "The initial closing of this offering will require a minimum investment (including the amount attributable to\nKUE LLC through conversion of its preferred limited partner units, including accrued dividends at the\noption of KUE LLC, into Common LP Units) of U.S. $280.0 million, There can be no assurance of\nadditional closings after the tnitial closing of the offering, whether before the completion of the Offering\nPeriod on March 31, 2007 or thereafter. Unless there are subsequent closings or offerings, cash\navailable for acquisitions and expansion would be limited to available cash of KLC and KUE and proceeds\nof future financings of KLC and KUE.\n\n6.1.2 The Company plans to acquire or invest in non-U.S. companies. This\ninternational expansion strategy is untested, and may include acquisitions or\ndevelopments in countries where for-profit education is not well established\n\nForeign acquisitions involve certain risks not typically associated with U.S. acquisitions, including risks\nrelating to (i) currency exchange matters, including fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S.\ndoilar and the various foreign currencies in which the Company’s non-U.S. interests are denominated,\nand costs associated with conversion from one currency into another; (ii) differences between the U.S.\nand foreign securities markets, including potential price volatility in and relative illiquidity of some foreign\nsecurities markets, the absence of uniform accounting and financial reporting standards and disclosure\nrequirements and jess governmental supervision and regulation; (ffi) certain economic and political risks,\nincluding potential restrictions on foreign acquisition and repatriation of capital, and the risks of political,\neconomic or social instability and the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; {iv) the possible\nimposition of foreign taxes on income and gains; and (v} differences in applicable legal systems, including\nthe possibility that the Company may experience difficulty in asserting legal claims or obtaining legal\nremedies against sellers of businesses in foreign jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company's prior operating history is limited to its U.S.-based businesses. Historical results may not\nbe indicative of future performance outside the U.S. The Company's non-U.S. businesses may operate in\ncountries in which the legal and regulatory frameworks, customary business models, education practices\nand philosophies and political and social norms are substantially different from those in the U.S.\nInternational expansion may also involve significant market risks, and opportunities to realize synergies\nmay be limited. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its international\nexpansion strategy.\n\nIn addition, the Company may acquire businesses or pursue business development opportunities in\ncountries where for-profit education is not weil-estabiished, which may involve greater risks than those\nassociated with similar U.S. acquisitions and developments. For example, the performance of a for-profit\neducation company located in a country where for-profit education is in an embryonic stage may be\nvolatile. Such a company also may be unable to achieve the growth or success achieved by education\nbusinesses in countries, such as the U.S., where for-profit education is more established. In addition,\nthere can be no assurance that for-profit education will ever become well-established or maintain viability\nin any given country. If any of the above events occur, the Company may suffer a partial or tota! joss of\ncapital invested in that business or development.\n\n6.1.3. The Company's success depends on its ability to attract and retain skilled\nemployees\n\nThe success of the Company will depend in part on continued employment of senior management and\nother key personnel, particularly the Principals. See the discussion under the heading “The Company\nmay not engage in certain businesses\" below. If one or mare senior management or key personnel\nbecome unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, the business and operations of the\nCompany would be disrupted.\n\nThe success of the Company also depends on attracting and retaining highly trained financial, marketing\nand other personnel. The Company will need to continue to hire additional personnel as its business\n\ngrows. The market for hiring such personnel is competitive and hiring such personnel may require\nincreased salaries and enhanced benefits under certain circumstances.
