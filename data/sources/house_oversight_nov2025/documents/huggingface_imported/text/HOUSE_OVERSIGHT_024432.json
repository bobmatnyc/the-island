TRANSMISSION OF THIS DOCUMENT TO ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE UNITED KINGDOM \nIS UNAUTHORISED AND MAY CONTRAVENE THE FSMA. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, \nPARTICIPATION IN THE COMPANY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO SUCH PERSONS AND PERSONS OF \nANY OTHER DESCRIPTION SHOULD NOT RELY ON THIS DOCUMENT \n14 \n\fNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR (including pro forma presentations thereof) and the \nrelated ratios presented in this Memorandum are supplemental measures of our performance that are not \nrequired by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. \n(\"GAAP\"). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR are not measurements of our financial \nperformance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income \nor any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow \nfrom operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. \nEBITDA represents net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation (including \nimpairment charges) and amortization. Pro forma presentations of EBITDA have also added back \nKinderCare Learning Centers, Inc.'s (\"KinderCare\") discontinued operations, consistent with KLC's \ntreatment of center closures and sales and KinderCare's historical presentation of EBITDA. Adjusted \nEBITDA represents EBITDA plus (i) expenses (minus gains) that we do not consider reflective of our \nongoing operations after the KinderCare acquisition, as further described in this Memorandum and (ii) \nmanagement fees which are subordinated to our obligations on our 7%% senior subordinated notes (the \n\"Notes\") and which are added back in measuring our performance for purposes of our ability to incur debt \nunder our indenture. Our actual and projected Adjusted EBITDA, where applicable, also exclude non-\ncash stock-based compensation expense, which is also excluded under our indenture; accruals under our \nstock appreciation rights (\"SAR\") plan; and accruals under our long term incentive plan, which are non-\ncash at the time of award and vest and become payable in three years subject to continued employment \n(with certain exceptions). Our pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for 2005 excludes restructuring and integration \ncharges associated with the KinderCare acquisition and the cost of operating parallel organizations during \nthe integration process, which management does not consider reflective of ongoing operations. Adjusted \nEBITDAR is Adjusted EBITDA plus rent expense. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted \nEBITDAR because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and \nbelieve they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the \nevaluation of issuers, many of which present EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDAR \nwhen reporting their results. \nWe are basing our executive incentive compensation payments in part on our performance measured \nusing Adjusted EBITDA including adjustments described herein. We also use financial measures similar \nto Adjusted EBITDA, though subject to certain different adjustments, in the senior credit facility that we \nentered into in connection with the KinderCare acquisition and the indenture governing the Notes to \nmeasure our compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence. Measures \nsimilar to Adjusted EBITDA are also widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price \npotential acquisition candidates. For example, we evaluated the KinderCare acquisition and our 2003 \nacquisition of ARAMARK Educational Resources to a significant degree based on their historical and \npotential EBITDA, as adjusted for items we did not consider representative of post-acquisition operations. \nWe believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to \nperiod and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital \nstructures (affecting relative interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies \nof changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities \nand equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We believe Adjusted EBITDAR is a useful \nmeasure of performance independent of occupancy costs. \nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA by adjusting EBITDA to eliminate the impact of a number of items we do \nnot consider indicative of our ongoing operations and for the other reasons noted above. For the reasons \nindicated herein, you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and whether you consider it \nappropriate. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR, you should be aware \nthat in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted \nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR should \nnot be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring \nitems. \n15 \n\fEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR have limitations as analytical tools, and you should \nnot consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. \nSome of these limitations are: \n• they do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n• they do not reflect the cost of our non-cash stock-based compensation or our SAR plan or long term \nincentive plan or the expense associated with allocating Profits Participation LP Units (as defined \nbelow) to employees; \n• they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital; \n• they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service \ninterest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; \n• they do not reflect management fees; \n• although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and \namortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and our non-GAAP measures do not reflect cash \nrequirements for such replacements or the related expense; \n• they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from the significant costs we have \nincurred in integrating KinderCare, and we are likely to incur significant integration costs in future \nacquisitions; \n• other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently \nthan we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure; and \n• they do not comply with the requirements of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Regulation G of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). \nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR should not be \nconsidered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or \nreduce our indebtedness. We compensate for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results as well as \nthese non-GAAP measures. \nFor more information, see our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements \nincluded elsewhere in this Memorandum. \nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \nThis Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this \nMemorandum. You should carefully consider the information set forth under \"Risk Factors\". The term \"KUE\" refers \nonly to Knowledge Universe Education L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The terms \"Knowledge \nUniverse Education\", the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" refer to KUE and, where applicable, its subsidiaries, and \ndo not refer to the Agents. In November 2005, KLC separated its education operations (\"KLC OpCo') from its real \nestate assets (\"KLC PropCo'). \n1.1. Company Overview \nKUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world and the largest for-profit education \ncompany in the pre-school to 12th grade segment (\"pre-K-12\") in the world. While the Company's \noperations are currently based within the U.S., the proceeds from this transaction will be used primarily to \nexpand KUE's education platform both globally and across the pre-K-12 education continuum. KUE's \nexisting portfolio of assets consists of: \n(i) \nKLC OpCo, the leading early childhood education \n(\"ECE\") company with 2,507 locations in 39 states \nand the District of Columbia and nearly two and a \nhalf times larger than its next closest competitor in \nterms of revenue; \n(ii) KLC PropCo, one of the largest education based \nreal estate portfolios in the U.S. consisting of 845 \nearly childhood centers located in 37 states; and \nKnowledge Universe \nEducation LP \n87.6%1 \nKUE Management Inc. \n(General Partner) \n17.9% to 40.0%2 \nKnowledge Learning \nCorporation (KLC) \nk12 Inc. \n(iii) A significant interest in k12, an online curriculum \nprovider and kindergarten through 12th grade management company, currently serving over \n25,000 students as the largest operator of online virtual schools in the U.S. \nThe principal owners of KUE are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green (collectively the \n\"Principals\"). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of experience in the \neducation sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. Steven Green, \nformer U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as an international \nindustrialist leading major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing, housing, consumer \nproducts, retail and real estate enterprises. The Company represents the Principals' sole vehicle for \nequity investment opportunities in the pre-K-12 sector going forward. \nThe Principals founded the Company and its affiliated companies over the past decade based on their \nvision of a world where competition for human capital3 is becoming the driving force of economic \nprosperity. To remain competitive in the world economy, countries will be forced to invest heavily in the \ndevelopment of their human capital. The Principals believe that an investment made in an individual's \neducation, especially at a young age, is the most effective way to build human capital and thereby \nincrease that individual's lifelong productivity. As the largest for-profit provider of ECE in the world, the \nCompany is well positioned to capitalize on these trends. \n:The 12.4% minority position is held by various investors. \nKUE's ownership varies depending on the liquidation value or sale value of k12 and according to the preference of the various securities KUE owns. \nAt higher valuations, KUE's percentage ownership is lower. See \"k12 Inc. (k12) — k12 Equity.\" \n3 The economic theory of Human Capital Policy was first published by University of Chicago professor James Heckman in Human Capital Policy, dated \nAugust 2002. \n19 \n\fEducation is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross \nnational income of $48 trillion.4 In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1 trillion market.' Education \nis still predominantly provided by public / governmental entities in most countries including the U.S. KUE \nbelieves that the industry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the \nevolution observed in the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and \ntelecommunications. \nThe Company's strategy is to grow its existing platforms both domestically and internationally and to \nexpand its assets globally across the pre-K-12 education continuum. In addition to its current investments \nin ECE and online curriculum, KUE will seek to expand by acquiring education companies offering \nservices or products that can complement its current offering. KUE believes that owning a diversified \nportfolio of assets in the pre-K-12 education space will allow it to leverage content and best practices \nacross multiple constituencies and to multiple markets. KUE's strategy in U.S. ECE is to expand its \nexisting platform through the opening of new centers, opportunistic acquisitions of smaller competitors \nand the sale of education-related products and services through existing channels. Internationally, KUE \nhas identified several near-term opportunities to expand into Europe, the Middle-East and Asia, with some \nof these opportunities in advanced stages of preparation. \nManagement has a history of successfully growing through acquisitions. In May 2003, KLC acquired \nAramark Educational Resources (\"AER\"), a company three times its size in terms of revenue. \nManagement completed the integration of AER in approximately 12 months, realizing approximately $10 \nmillion in net annual synergies and improving operational performance. In January 2005, the Company \nacquired KinderCare, the largest provider of ECE services in the U.S. at the time. Management achieved \napproximately $25 million in net annualized synergies through the closing of under-performing centers \nand the rationalization of corporate overhead. In November 2005, KLC separated its education \noperations (KLC OpCo) from its real estate assets (KLC PropCo). Management believes this division \nallows KLC OpCo management to focus on the core business of operating and growing the ECE \nbusiness while the maximization of the valuable educational real estate portfolio is managed and \nexpanded by a professional real estate firm, Greenstreet Real Estate Partners (formerly Greenstreet \nRealty Partners, L.P.), and also represents management's view of KLC's component businesses. \nManagement believes that KUE presents an attractive financial profile with its combination of businesses: \n(i) KLC OpCo, which generated $1.48 billion in pro forma revenue and $150 million in pro forma Adjusted \nEBITDA6 in 2005, is projected to grow organically to $2.3 billion and $320 million by 2011, respectively \nand to generate operating cash flow growing from $72 million in 2005 to $214 million in 2011; (ii) a real \nestate portfolio in KLC PropCo that generated an additional $88 million in pro forma EBITDA in 2005; and \n(Hi) an investment in k12, which continues to deliver top line growth in excess of 25% and has seen its \nrevenue grow at a 133% compounded annual growth rate over the last three fiscal years (from $6.7 \nmillion in 2002 to $85.1 million in 2005). \n1.2. Investment Rationale \n1.2.1 Attractive Industry Characteristics \nri The global for-profit education market is large and growing \n° Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics database. \n6 Source: US Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics and Training Magazine and Harris Nesbitt research. \n° Pro forma for the acquisition of KinderCare and the separation of KLC into KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo. \n20 \n\fEducation is one of the largest sectors in the world and represents a large portion of a country's \ninvestments \n— Represents approximately 5% of global gross national income of $48 trillion. In the U.S. alone, \neducation represents a $1 trillion market with for-profit education accounting for approximately $81 \nbillion or 7.8% of the overall market. \n— The pre-K-12 segment of the education market is approximately a $610 billion market, with for-\nprofit pre-K-12 education accounting for approximately $37.4 billion, over 6.1% of the pre-K-12 \nmarket/ \nThe for-profit education sector is growing at an attractive rate \n— U.S. education spending has grown at a stable compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") of 5.7% \nsince 1993. The for-profit component of this industry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate \ntraining) is projected to grow faster than the overall historical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual \nrate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit operations in the sector, to reach a market \nsize of $116 billion by 2010.7 \n— In addition, these estimates do not reflect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational \nmaterials such as supplemental tutoring, which represented an estimated $20 billion of additional \nspending in 2004. \n• Increasing competition for human capital \nTo remain competitive in the global economy, countries are investing heavily in the development of their \nhuman capital, especially at young ages \n— According to the World Bank's World Education Indicators, worldwide enrollment rates in pre-\nprimary education increased by 37% from 1995 to 2003.8 \n— KUE believes that education companies will become significantly more valuable as countries \nbecome increasingly aware of the competitive advantages afforded by education. Of the top 100 \nglobal companies by market cap, not a single education company is represented on the list. \nAs globalization of the economy and improving technologies flatten the playing field, demand for more \nstandardized education across regions increases  \n— KUE believes that increasingly global education standards, enhanced workforce mobility and new \ntechnologies are catalysts of world competition for human capital. \n• Several international growth opportunities \nThe Company is starting to execute on its international development strategy \n— In the near term, the Company is focusing on opportunities identified in the United Kingdom, Saudi \nArabia, the United Arab Emirates and China. Depending on the state and organization of each \ncountry's education sector, KUE's development will be executed through cooperation with \ngovernment authorities, outright acquisitions and/or the establishment of partnerships with key local \nplayers. \n7 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. \nSource: Education Trends in Perspective: Analysis of the World Education Indicators, 2005. \n21 \n\f— These initiatives could provide three key regional platforms for further development and \nconsolidation. \nIn the medium term, numerous opportunities for KUE should be generated by the increasing demand for \nquality for-profit educational offerings by governments and citizens around the world  \n— Competitive pressures for development of human capital, deficiencies of national education \nsystems, growth of a middle-class in China, India and the Middle East, demand for English \nlanguage offerings and changing demographics are some of the primary drivers of increased \ndemand internationally. \n— In China alone, 274 million children are under the age of 15, and 100 million are single-children \nunder the age of 25, as a result of the one-child policy. These demographics result in large \ndemand for education and increased spending capacity per child. \nI• Favorable demographic trends and customer behavior in the U.S. \nGrowing number of working mothers \n— According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates, women are expected to represent \nnearly 48% of the total U.S. workforce by 2012, up from 46.6% in 2002.° \n— In the U.S., approximately 60% of mothers with children under the age of six are employed. \nIncreasing birth rate  \n— There are approximately 24 million children under the age of five in the U.S. today. According to \nthe U.S. Census Bureau, absolute birth rates are going to continue to increase, and the population \nof children in the U.S. five and under is expected to increase to approximately 27 million by 2015.10 \nEssential nature of the service to the consumer \n— As with healthcare, parents are primarily focused on the quality of the service that their child \nreceives and the proximity of the center to their home or work; price is typically a secondary \nconsideration. By relieving parents of the requirement to stay at home with their children, ECE \nallows both men and women to participate in the workforce and generate income for the \nhousehold. \n1.2.2 Compelling Business Profile \n• KUE presents an attractive financial profile \nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo had operations in 39 states and Washington \nD.C. and generated pro forma revenue of $1.48 billion  \n— With organic growth projected to be in excess of 5% per annum through 2011, geographic diversity \nand double-digit Adjusted EBITDA margins, KLC OpCo can generate attractive returns. \n— KLC OpCo generates strong operating cash flow (48% of 2005 pro forma Adjusted EBITDA) which \nprovides significant resources to fund investment and support equity return-enhancing leverage, a \n° Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. \n1° Source: Population Projections Branch, U.S. Census Bureau, \"US. Interim Projections by Age, Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin,\" May 2004. \n22 \n\fcapability that is expected to increase in line with the 13.5% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR projected \nuntil 2011. \nk12 continues to grow at an impressive rate, with annual enrollment growth proiected in excess of 25% \nover the next two years \n— Many of k12's direct costs are semi-fixed in nature (e.g., school administration) creating strong \neconomies of scale as this business continues to grow. \n— With $70 million invested in the development of the platform for kindergarten to 9th grade classes, \nextension of the offering into new states and schools is expected to be achieved at relatively low \ncosts. \n• Leading market position in early childhood education with significant brand equity \nLeading market positions in early childhood education and before and after school programs \n___ Largest U.S. provider of ECE services (1,934 centers). \nKLC OpCo's U.S. \nMarket Position \nOrganization \nLTM \nCapacity Revenue' Centers \nOwner \nKLC OpCo \t253,000 \t$1,477.7' \t1,934 \tKUE \nLa Petite Academy \t89,000 \t411.1 \t649 \tJP Morgan \nBright Horizons \t66,350 \t625.3 \t616 \tPublic \nABC Learning' \t69,000 \t220.7 \t460 \tPublic \nLTM revenue in millions.

ABC has approximately 1,167 total centers (707 of which are located in Australia and New \nZealand) and combined LTM revenue of $441.1 million using Learning Care Group LTM revenue of \n$220.7 million as of 10/14/05 and ABC LTM revenue of $292.7 million AUD as of 6/30/05, converted \nat an average exchange rate of .753 AUD/USD from 6/30/04 to 6/30/05. \n— Second largest U.S. provider of ECE to employers (122 centers). \n— Largest U.S. for-profit provider of before and after school programs (573 sites). \nHigh brand awareness and customer recognition  \n— The programs are marketed primarily under the KinderCare, Children's Discovery Centers, \nKnowledge Beginnings, and Children's World brand names. KinderCare enjoyed 87% aided \nawareness as of November 2005.11 \n• Superior competitive position of KLC OpCo as a result of proprietary curriculum, standards of \nexcellence and experience and scale \n11 Source: Parthenon Conjoint Survey. \n23 \n\fKLC OpCo has leveraged its scale and operational expertise to roll out a proprietary curriculum and to \nprovide enhanced corporate level services \n— Curriculum has been developed, rolled out and refined over many years and provides a significant \u000bcompetitive advantage in an industry where small independent players do not have the resources \u000bto develop comparable programs. \u000b— Operational leverage allows for enhanced marketing, back-office, legal and compliance functions, \u000bkeeping KLC OpCo at the forefront of education standards. \u000bControls that meet or exceed requirements established by licensing authorities, state and federal \ngovernment and accrediting bodies \n— Controls include rigorous and stringent hiring procedures and uniform rules for conduct. \u000b— 43% of KLC OpCo's centers, over four times the industry average of 10%, are accredited by the \u000bNational Association for the Education of Young Children (referred to herein as \"NAEYC\"), the \u000bnation's leading accreditation body. Management believes that all the Company's centers' \u000boperations and policies meet or are substantially compliant with NAEYC accreditation \u000brequirements. \u000b• A compelling business model at k12 \u000bAs the state of education across the U.S. is generating increasing concerns, k12 provides a compelling \nvalue proposition \n— Children continue to perform poorly on assessment tests geared to measure reading, writing and \u000bmath skills. The passing of legislation such as the \"No Child Left Behind Act of 2001\" which, \u000bamong other things, provides for increased funding for education and implementation of \u000bachievement level standards, demonstrates the commitment of government to address the issue. \u000bTechnology and content platform easily leverageable to provide results-driven curriculum and service \n— With $70 million invested in the development of the platform for kindergarten to 9th grade classes, \u000bextension of the offering into new states and schools is expected to be achieved at relatively low \u000bcosts. \u000b— k12 benefits from stable demand for its curriculum and services which is reflected by current \u000breenrollment rates of 65% to 70%. \u000b— Many of the direct costs are semi-fixed in nature (e.g., school administration) creating strong \u000beconomies of scale as this business continues to grow. \u000b• Valuable real estate portfolio of centers providing solid asset base \u000b845 owned centers recently appraised at approximately $1.25 billion12 \n— New organization separating management of real estate assets allows KLC OpCo education teams \u000bto focus on the core education business. \u000b— Long term partnership with Greenstreet Real Estate Partners ensuring state-of-the-art \u000bmanagement of the real estate assets by a leader in this field. \n12 Actual appraisal was for 713 out of 845 centers and the appraised value was $1.1 billion. The $1.25 billion is achieved by taking the independent \u000bappraisal valuation methodology and extrapolating it to the remaining 132 centers. \n24 \n\fB Strong leadership teams \nKUE \n___ Strong team of highly experienced professionals at the KUE level, led by CEO Lowell Milken, \nChairman Michael Milken and Vice-Chairmen Steven Green and Ted Sanders. The team \ncontributes an average of more than two decades of experience in their respective fields to KUE. \n___ Providing corporate headquarters support services in the areas of strategy and business \ndevelopment, acquisitions, recruiting of executives, communication and government relations. \nKLC OpCo \n— Highly experienced management team comprised of both experts in the field of education (C00 Dr. \nElanna Yalow has substantial experience operating for-profit ECE centers), as well as business \nprofessionals. \n— Seasoned executive and middle management team with average Company tenure of ten years. \nk12 \n— Chairman, Founder and acting CEO Ron Packard has extensive experience in the K-12 education \nspace and was previously with KLC before founding k12. John Baule, Executive Vice President \nand CFO, served as CFO of Headstrong for five years before joining k12. \n1.2.3 Value Creating Strategy \n• Value is created by owning assets across the pre-K-12 education continuum \nIncremental value is expected to be created from strategic and financial synergies inherent in a global \nplatform  \n— The Company can exploit the similarities in various education markets by capitalizing on the assets \nit owns (e.g., using KLC's expertise to establish similar operations across geographies and across \nthe pre-K-12 education continuum). \n— Sharing of best practices globally and ability to cross-sell products and services to the Company's \ncustomers. \n— Entry into less structured international markets early in their development cycle to establish \nattractive competitive positions. \n• Multiple growth opportunities at KLC and k12 \nTop line organic growth at KLC OpCo is expected to be driven by several factors:  \n___ Historically the industry has demonstrated a pattern of price increases above inflation. Historical \nindustry data shows an average tuition rate increase of 7% per annum.13 \n— Higher \"Utilization\"14 resulting from increased student enrollment, improved retention rates, further \nnetwork rationalization to better align supply with demand, more favorable center build rate in the \nbroader industry and favorable macro trends. \n\"Source: The National Economic Impacts of the Child Care Sector 2002. \n25 \n\f— The ECE industry generates approximately $54 billion in total spending in the U.S. and has grown \nat a compound annual growth rate of 10% since 1982. It is expected to grow at a 3.4% \ncompounded annual rate through 2010 according to Harris Nesbitt research. The ECE industry's \ngrowth has been driven by several favorable social and demographic trends including: the increase \nin working mothers and single-parent or dual-income families, historically high birth rates, and \nincrease in popularity of center-based care. \n___ Net opening of new centers as the integration of KinderCare winds down and the number of center \nopenings starts exceeding the number of closures. \n— Leverage of KLC OpCo's footprint to market additional educational products and services to the \nmore than 300,000 children KLC OpCo interacts with each year, their parents, grandparents and \nother child care providers. Selected incremental revenue opportunities include: foreign language or \nmusic lessons, educational materials and financial services (life insurance, health insurance, tuition \nfinancing, etc.). \nGrowth through acquisitions and industry consolidation  \n— Consolidation strategy supported by the highly fragmented early childhood industry, with for-profit \nchains representing only approximately 5% of the market in aggregate, and small independent \nproviders representing 60% of the market.15 \n___ Management has demonstrated an ability to grow through acquisitions, as evidenced by the three \nnetworks acquired by KLC since inception, of sizes up to 1,000 centers. \nMultiple drivers of expected double-digit growth at k12 \n— Existing school enrollment rates at k12 expected to continue to increase at double digit rates for at \nleast the next three years, as k12 further penetrates its existing markets through commercial and \nmarketing push. \n— k12 currently operates virtual public schools in 11 states and the District of Columbia. As \nlegislatures in other states permit the formation of virtual public schools, k12 expects to have \nopportunities to expand into new states. \n\"Utilization is calculated as the total actual child care revenues earned at centers that are open at the calculation date divided by the total potential \nchild care revenue (based upon the center's undiscounted pre-school tuition rate and the center's total licensed capacity) during the related time \nperiod. \nSource: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. \n26 \n\f2.

Subscriptions \nreceived will be promptly refunded if 280,000 Common LP \nUnits are not issued for $1,000 per unit (in cash or preferred \nlimited partner units) before the end of the Offering Period. \nSubscriptions paid in any closing will not otherwise be \nreturned regardless of the size or occurrence of any \nsubsequent closing. \nInvestors admitted during the Offering Period after the first \nclosing of this offering and after September 30, 2006 will pay \nan additional amount accruing at a rate of 0.67% per month \ncalculated from the first closing date of the offering (pro-\nrated for partial periods) for each Common LP Unit \npurchased, which will be distributed promptly to the holders \nof Common LP Units outstanding prior to such admission in \nproportion to the number of Common LP Units held by such \nholders. \nUse of Proceeds: \nCapital Structure: \nThe proceeds of the offering described herein will be used: \n(i) to expand operations, including through strategic \nacquisitions in the U.S. and internationally, (ii) to develop \nnew products and services, (Hi) to repay, in whole or in part, \n$150 million of existing debt plus accrued interest (including \nthrough the application of a portion of the proceeds of the \ninitial closing of the offering), (iv) an estimated $50 million in \nfees and expenses (including amounts payable from July 1, \n2006 under a Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement (the \n\"Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement\")), (v) in the discretion \nof KUE LLC, payment at the initial closing of the offering of \napproximately $7.0 million of accrued preferred return on the \npreferred limited partner units of KUE being converted to \nCommon LP Units if such accrued preferred return is not \nconverted to Common LP Units and (vi) for other corporate \npurposes. \nAssuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by \nMarch 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends on the \npreferred limited partner units are paid in cash, \napproximately 2,530,000 Units will be outstanding. The \nInvestors will own approximately 40% of KUE in the form of \nCommon LP Units (excluding profits participation limited \npartner units of KUE, \"Profits Participation LP Units\") and \napproximately 40% of the General Partner in the form of \nClass A Shares. \nThe General Partner will be the sole general partner of KUE \nand will hold approximately 1,000 General Partner Units \n(\"GP Units\") in KUE, representing approximately 0.04% \nownership in KUE. \nThe economic interest in KUE represented by the Common \n28 \n\fLP Units and the GP Units will be reduced by the Profits \nParticipation LP Units as described below under \n\"Distributions.\" \nAssuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by \nMarch 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends on the \npreferred limited partner units are paid in cash, KUE LLC, \ncontrolled by the Principals, will hold approximately \n1,530,000 Common LP Units representing approximately \n60% ownership in KUE (excluding Profits Participation LP \nUnits) and 1,530,000 Class A Shares. The Common LP \nUnits owned by KUE LLC will not be transferable, except to \n(i) the Principals; (ii) to affiliates of the Principals; and/or OD \nto family members and/or charitable organizations in \nconnection with the Principals' estate planning, unless \ncombined with the corresponding percentage of Class A \nShares to form Units and transferred in the form of Units in \naccordance with the Limited Partnership Agreement. \nKnowledge Universe Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited \nliability company (\"KUH LLC\") controlled by the Principals, \nwill hold 900 Class B ordinary shares of the General Partner \n(the \"Class B Shares\"). The Class B Shares held by the \nPrincipals and their affiliates will not be transferable, except \nto (i) the Principals; (H) to the affiliates of the Principals; \nand/or (iii) to family members and/or charitable organizations \nin connection with the Principals' estate planning. The Class \nB Shares will automatically convert to Class A Shares if the \nPrincipals' aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in \nKUE is less than 15% of the outstanding Partnership Units \n(as defined below) of KUE. \nA limited liability company (\"KULG LLC-1\"), of which \nKnowledge Universe Learning Group LLC, a Delaware \nlimited liability company that is controlled by the Principals \n(\"KULG\"), and certain other persons designated by KULG \nare members, will be the holder of the Profits Participation \nLP Units (the \"Profits Participation Limited Partner\") with the \neconomic rights as set forth in \"— Distributions\" below. At \neach closing of any sale of Units to Investors where the \naggregate purchase price of all Units acquired by Investors \nto date is less than or equal to $1.5 billion (during the \nOffering Period or thereafter), the Profits Participation \nLimited Partner will be issued a number of Profits \nParticipation LP Units such that the aggregate shall equal at \nleast 9/11ths of the 11% of \"Partnership Units\" (Common LP \nUnits, GP Units, and Profits Participation LP Units) that may \nbe represented by Profits Participation LP Units. Additional \nProfits Participation LP Units will be issued to the Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner, at such time and in such \nnumbers as the Profits Participation Limited Partner will \ndirect, based upon the issuance by the Profit Participation \nLimited Partner of interests to members of the Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner (who may include employees, \nofficers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its \n29 \n\fsubsidiaries and joint ventures as designated by KULG other \nthan the Principals and their affiliates), the vesting schedule \nof such interests, and whether certain tax elections are made \nby the recipients of such interests; provided, however, the \ntotal number of Profits Participation LP Units shall not \nexceed a number equal to eleven percent (11%) of the \naggregate number of Partnership Units. Any increase in the \nnumber of Profits Participation LP Units following the sale of \nthe first $1.5 billion of Common LP Units to Investors \nrequires a majority vote of the Independent Committee. \nSubsequent to the completion of this offering, KUE may \nraise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt \nsecurities. KUE will not have any preferred limited partner \nunits outstanding upon completion of this offering but KUE \nmay issue limited partner units with preferences over the \nCommon LP Units in the future and may amend the Limited \nPartnership Agreement accordingly. \nDistributions: \nFirst, to the Common Limited Partners and the General \nPartner in proportion to and to the extent of their unreturned \nCapital Contributions, but in no case may a distribution \npursuant to this paragraph exceed a Partner's positive \nadjusted capital account balance; \nSecond, to the Common Limited Partners and the General \nPartner and the Profits Participation Limited Partner (with \nrespect to Profits Participation Units theretofore allocated to \npersons other than the Principals and their Affiliates, if \nspecified by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, but not \nwith respect to more than 2/11ths of the Profits Participation \nUnits) to the extent of an 8% preferred return; \nThird, to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in the \nadditional amount the Profits Participation Limited Partner \nwould have received pursuant to the prior paragraph if it had \nfully participated in the distribution of the 8% preferred return \nwith respect to all outstanding Profits Participation Units; and \nFourth, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner, and the General Partner in \nproportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner. \nDistributions may be made in cash or in kind. Allocations of \nincome, gains, profits and losses are described in \"The \nStructure of KUE and the General Partner\" in this Private \nPlacement Memorandum. \nThe Limited Partnership Agreement gives the General \nPartner the authority to override the distribution provisions of \nthe Limited Partnership Agreement described above in order \nto achieve the desired economic arrangement of KUE, which \nis: (i) first, to return the Partners' Capital Contributions to \nthem; (ii) second, for the Common Limited Partners and the \nGeneral Partner to receive their Preferred Return while the \n30 \n\fProfits Participation Limited Partner concurrently receives an \namount equal to a fraction of the amount the Common \nLimited Partners and the General Partner received pursuant \nto their Preferred Return (such fraction to be equal to the \nportion of the Units held by the Profits Participation Limited \nPartner attributable to members of the Profits Participation \nLimited Partner other than the Principals), multiplied by the \nnumber of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited \nPartner divided by the number of outstanding Units other \nthan those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited \nPartner; (iii) third, for the Profits Participation Limited Partner \nto receive an amount equal to a fraction of the amount the \nCommon Limited Partners and the General Partner received \npursuant to their Preferred Return (such fraction to be equal \nto the portion of the Units held by the Profits Participation \nLimited Partner attributable to members of the Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner who are Principals or their \naffiliates), multiplied by the number of Units held by the \nProfits Participation Limited Partner divided by the number of \noutstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner; and (iv) finally, for all Partners \n(including the Profits Participation Limited Partner) to share \nin the profits of the Partnership in proportion to the number \nof Units held by them. \nNotwithstanding any contrary provisions below addressing \nequal merger consideration, in connection with any \ndistribution of securities of a subsidiary entity which has high \nvote and low vote (or non-voting) securities with substantially \nequivalent economic rights, the Principals can receive the \nhigh-vote securities in such a distribution while the other \nholders of Common LP Units receive the low vote (or non-\nvoting) securities, as long as the securities otherwise have \nsubstantially equivalent economic rights and the high-vote \nsecurities have mandatory conversion features equivalent to \nthe mandatory conversion provision of the Class B Shares. \nEqual Merger Consideration Provision: The Principals (through KUE LLC) and the Investors will \nreceive the same consideration per Common LP Unit and/or \nClass A/Class B Shares in connection with a sale, merger, \nrecapitalization, share repurchase, dividend, or any other \ntransaction where all holders of Common LP Units or shares \nin the General Partner receive consideration with respect to \ntheir Common LP Units or shares, other than with respect to \ncorporate restructuring transactions, such as a holding \ncompany merger, conversion of KUE from an exempted \nlimited partnership to a corporation or other entity, change of \ndomicile, or any other transaction that the Independent \nCommittee determines is a \"corporate restructuring.\" In any \nsuch corporate restructuring transaction, the Principals \n(through KUE LLC) may receive securities with high-voting \nrights and the Investors may receive securities with limited or \nno voting rights so long as the consideration received by the \nPrincipals (through KUE LLC) and the other Partners per \n31 \n\fCommon LP Unit have substantially equivalent economic \nprovisions. \nFixed Overhead Payment: \nKUE and/or one or more of its subsidiaries will pay $20 \nmillion annually to KULG in quarterly installments beginning \nJuly 1, 2006 pursuant to the Fixed Overhead Payment \nAgreement as an agreed upon payment to provide for the \nreimbursement of expenses and other costs incurred by \nKULG on behalf of KUE and its subsidiaries (including, but \nnot limited to, salaries and bonuses of KULG employees \nproviding services to KUE and its subsidiaries, fees and \nexpenses relating to financing transactions and acquisitions, \nprofessional fees and other administrative expenses). To \nthe extent that the U.S. $2,500,000 fee payable pursuant to \nan existing management services agreement with \nKnowledge Learning Corporation is paid to any person or \nentity other than a subsidiary of KUE, the amount payable to \nKULG by KUE will be reduced by the amount of such \npayment to such other person or entity. The $20 million \nannual fee will terminate upon the Initial Listing (as defined \nbelow) or the sale of KUE to a person or entity that is not a \nKUE LLC Entity. \nVoting Rights: The General Partner will manage and operate KUE. \nThe Investors will have no voting rights on matters affecting \nCompany business with respect to their Common LP Units in \nKUE because the Investors will be limited partners of KUE. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions, \nKUE must obtain the consent of (a) the holders of a majority \nof the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the Principals to \namend the Limited Partnership Agreement in a manner that \nis adverse to the Common LP holders and (b) the holders of \nat least 90% of the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the \nPrincipals to amend the \"Equal Merger Consideration \nProvision\" described above. In addition, the General Partner \nmay not take any action to (a) alter or add to its Articles or \n(b) alter or add to its Memorandum with respect to any \nobjects, powers or other matters specified therein that would \nadversely affect the rights of holders of Class A Shares \nwithout the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the \nClass A Shares. \nHolders of the Class A Shares of the General Partner will \nhave one vote per share. The holders of Class B Shares, \nwill have in the aggregate one more vote than the requisite \nlegal vote required to approve particular matters. In addition, \nthe Investors will have the right to elect directors to the \nBoard of Directors of the General Partner as set forth in \n\"Board of Directors\" below. \nThe Class B Shares will automatically convert to Class A \nShares if the Principals' aggregate direct and indirect \neconomic interest in KUE is less than 15% of the \n32 \n\foutstanding Partnership Units of KUE. \nBoard of Directors: \nInitial Listing Process: \nThe General Partner will have a Board of Directors initially \nconsisting of up to 13 persons. \nFollowing the first closing of the offering and prior to the \n\"Initial Listing\" (as defined below), the outside Investor \n(including its affiliates) holding the greatest number of shares \nin the General Partner at the first closing of the offering will \nappoint two directors of the General Partner and the holders \nof the Class B Shares will appoint the remaining directors. \nFollowing the initial appointment of the Board, the Board \nmay, in its sole discretion, increase the number of directors, \nincluding to accommodate investors that invest subsequent \nto the initial closing of the offering of the Units, provided that \nthe outside Investor appointing two directors pursuant to the \nparagraph above shall have the right to appoint additional \ndirectors as required to maintain a ratio of such Investor's \ndesignees to total Board members of not less than 2/15ths. \n\"Independent Directors\" of the Board of Directors of the \nGeneral Partner shall be individuals who (a) are not (i) a \nPrincipal, (ii) a family member of a Principal, (iii) an \nemployee of a Principal or any entity controlled by one or \nmore of the Principals, and (b) meet the definition of \n\"independent director\" set forth in Rule 303A.02 of the New \nYork Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (as if the \nGeneral Partner, the Partnership and each of its Subsidiaries \nwere the \"listed company\") , including any such individuals \nappointed by the Investors who otherwise satisfy the \nrequirements of this definition. \nAt the time of the final closing of this offering, the General \nPartner will have at least two Independent Directors. After \nthe Initial Listing and so long as consistent with contractual, \nlisting and licensing obligations, a majority of the board of \ndirectors of the listed company will be Independent \nDirectors. \n\"Initial Listing\" means a listing on a recognized international \nsecurities exchange with a substantially concurrent \nunderwritten offering generating gross proceeds of U.S. \n$200 million or more. \"Initial Listing\" refers to the Initial \nListing of KUE or any successor or any subsidiary of KUE to \nwhich substantially all of KUE's assets and liabilities have \nbeen transferred or are held. \nThe General Partner may take and cause KUE to take such \nactions as the General Partner reasonably deems necessary \nto complete the Initial Listing on the recognized international \nsecurities exchange or exchanges selected by the General \nPartner, including without limitation a restructuring or \nreorganization or other transaction or asset transfer between \nor among KUE and any of its subsidiaries, and may require \n33 \n\fPartners to exchange their interests in KUE and the General \nPartner for interests in a subsidiary of KUE. \nRelated Party Transactions: \nRelated party transactions include transactions between (1) \nany of the Principals or any of their affiliates or any entity \ncontrolled by any of the Principals, and (2) KUE or any direct \nor indirect subsidiary or joint venture of KUE involving more \nthan $1 million (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any \nmerger, acquisition, asset purchase or similar transaction \nbetween KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures, on the one \nhand, and any person of which fifteen percent (15%) or more \nof the voting stock (or similar voting interests) is owned by \nKUE LLC or its affiliates, on the other hand). Related party \ntransactions do not include (a) any transaction solely \nbetween or among KUE and any of its direct or indirect \nsubsidiaries or joint ventures in which the Principals do not \nhave any direct or indirect ownership interest (other than as \na result of their ownership in the General Partner and KUE), \n(b) reasonable and customary director, advisory board \nmember, or consultant compensation and benefits \n(including, without limitation, retirement, health, stock option \nand other benefit plans) as approved by the Independent \nCommittee, provided that any such compensation, benefits \nand arrangements to the Principals that do not exceed $1 \nmillion in the aggregate annually shall not be subject to such \napproval, and customary indemnification arrangements, (c) \ntransactions and arrangements pursuant to or contemplated \nby express terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement of \nKUE, including the \"Investment in Subsidiaries\" and \"Co-\nInvest Right\" described below, and any payments pursuant \nthereto, and the Fixed Overhead Payment described above, \n(d) agreements, transactions and arrangements described in \n\"Related Party Transactions\" in this Private Placement \nMemorandum and any amendment thereto (so long as such \namendment is not disadvantageous to the Investors as a \nwhole in any material respect) or any transaction \ncontemplated thereby and any payments pursuant thereto, \nand (e) admissions of any affiliate of the Principals to KUE \nas a Limited Partner on terms substantially equivalent to \nconcurrent admissions of persons that are not affiliates of \nthe Principals. \nIf the size of the related party transaction is greater than $1 \nmillion and equal to or less than $50 million, then either (a) \nthe Independent Committee must approve the transaction or \n(b) the transaction must be approved by the holders of a \nmajority of the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the \nPrincipals. \nIf the size of the related party transaction is greater than $50 \nmillion, then the transaction must be approved by both (a) \nthe Independent Committee and (b) the holders of a majority \nof the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the Principals. \n34 \n\fInvestment in Subsidiaries: \nTransferability of Units: \nTag-Along Right: \nNot in limitation of any commitments or restrictions the \nPrincipals may have entered into, prior to an Initial Listing, \nKUE may not permit any of its subsidiaries or controlled joint \nventures (which shall not include, for the avoidance of doubt, \ncertain exempt companies contemplated by the following \nparagraph) to issue or grant any equity interests in such \nsubsidiaries or controlled joint ventures to any of the \nPrincipals or any of their affiliates (other than KUE, its \nsubsidiaries and controlled joint ventures) unless (i) the \nIndependent Committee approves and the Investors who are \naccredited investors (as such term is defined in Regulation \nD) or otherwise legally eligible to participate are offered the \nopportunity to participate on the same terms as the \nPrincipals and their affiliates and in proportion to their \neconomic ownership of KUE or (ii) such subsidiary or joint \nventure of KUE has completed an initial listing on a \nrecognized international securities exchange, subject to \ncertain limited exceptions. \nThe Principals intend that KUE will be their exclusive vehicle \nfor equity investment opportunities in and acquisitions of for-\nprofit companies engaged primarily in the business of pre-K \nthrough 12th grade education of children, subject to limited \nexceptions as set forth in \"The Structure of KUE and the \nGeneral Partner\" in this Private Placement Memorandum. \nThe Common LP Units and the Class A Shares comprising \nthe Units owned by the Investors will not be separately \ntransferable, and the Units are to be transferred as a whole \nunless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors of the \nGeneral Partner and the Independent Committee (defined \nbelow). \nUnits held by an Investor may not be sold, transferred or \nassigned without the prior written consent of the General \nPartner, not to be unreasonably withheld. The General \nPartner intends, during the first two years after the applicable \nclosing of the offering, to approve transfers of the Units to an \naffiliate of the Investor, in compliance with applicable law. \nAfter such time, the General Partner intends to approve \ntransfers of Units to an affiliate of the Investor or to another \nInvestor (and affiliates thereof), in each case in compliance \nwith applicable law. The General Partner also intends to \napprove transfers pursuant to the Tag-Along Right and Drag-\nAlong Right provisions described below. \nUnless the Investors' Units (or securities received in \nexchange for Units if the Initial Listing is of a Subsidiary of \nKUE) are freely tradable without volume restrictions on the \nexchange on which the Initial Listing occurred, with respect \nto any proposed transfer of the Common LP Units held by \nKUE LLC and its affiliates to a non-affiliate purchaser (and, \nunless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors and the \nIndependent Committee of the General Partner, a \n35 \n\fcorresponding percentage of Class A Shares held by KUE \nLLC), the Investors may sell a pro rata portion of their \nCommon LP Units and corresponding Class A Shares in the \nproposed transfer on the same terms and in exchange for \nthe same consideration per Unit (and Class A Share) \nreceived by KUE LLC and its affiliates. \nFollowing the Initial Listing, the tag-along right will continue \nfor certain Investors with respect to transfers for value of the \nUnits (or units of the listed entity as the case may be) by the \nPrincipals or their affiliates to non-affiliates (excluding \ntransfers on a recognized international securities exchange) \nabove the following thresholds in one or more transactions: \n(i) 15% of the Principals' original KUE holdings to any single \nbuyer (or affiliates of that buyer) or (i) 33% of the Principals' \noriginal KUE holdings in the aggregate. \nDrag-Along Right: \nCo-Invest Right: \nAdditional Listing of Investors' Units: \nPrior to the Initial Listing, with respect to any proposed \ntransfer of a majority of the Units held by KUE LLC to a \nproposed non-affiliate purchaser (and, unless otherwise \napproved by the Board of Directors and the Independent \nCommittee of the General Partner, a corresponding \npercentage of Class A Shares held by KUE LLC), the \nInvestors may be required to sell a pro rata portion of their \nUnits and corresponding Class A Shares in the proposed \ntransfer on the same terms and in exchange for the same \nconsideration received by KUE LLC. \nPrior to the Initial Listing, if KUE proposes to issue for cash \nany Units or securities convertible into Units after the \nOffering Period (subject to certain exceptions), then KUE is \nrequired to offer to each Investor that is an accredited \ninvestor (as such term is defined in Regulation D) or \notherwise legally eligible to participate in the offering, the \nright to purchase a pro rata portion of such securities. \nPrior to the Initial Listing, the Investors have substantially \nequivalent rights with respect to issuances of securities by \nthe General Partner. \nBeginning any time after six months after the Initial Listing, \none or more holders holding an aggregate of $100 million of \nmore of the Units may request KUE and the General Partner \nto take such action as may be necessary for their Units to be \nfreely tradable and not subject to volume restrictions on the \ninternational securities exchange on which the Initial Listing \noccurred; provided that no more than one such action may \nbe required in any 12 month period and customary cut-back \nand other provisions will apply in any such listing or \nunderwritten transaction, as the case may be. KUE will use \nits commercially reasonable efforts to cause such action to \ncover such holders and the securities of any other holders \nlegally eligible to participate in such action. \n36 \n\fTerm: The term of KUE will be indefinite, unless terminated earlier \nin accordance with the Limited Partnership Agreement. \nIlliquidity Period: \nKUE will operate for a period of seven years from the date of \nthe first closing of this offering. If there has not been an \nInitial Listing by the end of seven years from the date of the \nfirst closing of this offering, the Board of Directors of the \nGeneral Partner will determine whether to pursue a sale of \nKUE or an Initial Listing (or a dual track process); provided, \nhowever, in the event that not less than 75% of the value of \nKUE at that time is represented by shares of securities listed \non one or more recognized international securities \nexchanges and such shares have been or will be distributed \nas soon as reasonably practicable thereafter to the Investors \nand the Investors have received distributions of cash and/or \nsuch securities valued at amounts equal to or in excess of \ntheir original capital contributions, then there shall be two \nextensions of one year's duration each in order for KUE to \ncomplete either an Initial Listing or to have the remaining \nvalue of KUE represented by shares of securities listed on a \nrecognized international securities exchange and to \ndistribute such shares to the Investors. The Board of \nDirectors shall approve the desired course of action. \nIf the Board determines to pursue a sale of KUE (or an Initial \nListing or a dual track process), then the Principals must \ndetermine at such time whether they intend to participate as \na potential bidder in the sale process. \nIf the Principals elect not to participate as a potential bidder \nin a sale process, then they will not be allowed to \nsubsequently elect to participate as a potential bidder unless \nthe sale process does not result in a buyer at a price the \nIndependent Committee deems to be \"fair.\" If the sale \nprocess results in a transaction that the Independent \nCommittee deems to be \"fair\", the Principals will be required \nto sell their entire stake in KUE (Common LP Units and \nProfits Participation LP Units on an \"as converted\" basis) on \nthe same terms as the Investors. \nIf the Principals elect to participate as a potential bidder in a \nsale process, then the sale process will be managed by the \nIndependent Committee and the Principals will be precluded \nfrom participating in Board deliberations regarding the sale \nprocess. In addition, the Principals will be required to sell \ntheir entire stake in KUE on the same terms as the Investors \nto the winning bidder in the event the Principals do not \nsubmit the most attractive bid. \nIn the event that a sale of KUE or an Initial Listing has not \noccurred within nine years from the date the first Investors \nare admitted to KUE, the Independent Committee shall \ndetermine whether to pursue a sale of KUE (or an Initial \nListing or a dual track process). A majority vote of the \n37 \n\fIndependent Committee on this issue shall be binding on the \nBoard of Directors of the General Partner and will require the \nBoard of Directors of the General Partner to pursue such \naction within ninety (90) days. \nIndemnification: KUE will indemnify the General Partner and its members, \nofficers, directors, and employees, and at the General \nPartner's discretion, any other person providing services to \nKUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures. KUE has provided a \ncustomary indemnity to the Agents in connection with their \nservices. \nPeriodic Reporting: KUE will provide annual audited financial statements and \nsemi-annual reports. The General Partner will provide such \nperiodic reports if engaged in any business other than acting \nas general partner of KUE or if it owns any material assets \nother than an interest in KUE. \nCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax \nConsequences: consequences that may be relevant to prospective investors, \nplease read \"Certain Income Tax Consequences\" in this \nPrivate Placement Memorandum. \n38 \n\f3.

SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA \nThe following summary historical pro forma and projected financial data should be read in conjunction \nwith the financial statements and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC's Pro Forma Results of \nOperations\" presented elsewhere in this Memorandum. See also \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" \nelsewhere in this Memorandum for a discussion of the derivation and limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted \nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. The historical information is pro forma for the effects of our acquisition \nof KinderCare in January 2005 and for the separation of our business into operating (KLC OpCo) and \nproperty (KLC PropCo) in November 2005, as if those transactions and related financing had occurred on \nJanuary 1, 2004. The rental income received by KLC PropCo in all periods presented is primarily \ncomprised of lease payments from KLC OpCo. \nOur pro forma results for KLC were not prepared in conformity with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the \nSEC (which would not, among other limitations, permit a 2004 pro forma presentation after completion of \nour 2005 financial statements). In addition, by presenting a pro forma comparison, this section does not \ninclude a comparison of KLC's historical GAAP consolidated operating results or segment information that \nwould be required by Item 3-03 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. In addition, the non-GAAP financial \ninformation presented below does not comply with Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Regulation G of the \nSEC. For further information, please see KLC's GAAP financial statements and those of KinderCare \nincluded in this Memorandum. \nThe pro forma presentation below is not shown with adjustments to historical financial statements. \nInstead, it is based on a \"ground up\" combination of corporate level expenditures (overhead and capital \nexpenditures) and internal financial statements derived from a center-by-center build up of KLC's results. \nThe primary reasons for the presentation based on internal reports are different fiscal year ends and \nexpense classification between KLC and KinderCare. \nProjected results presented below are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but \nwhich are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. For a discussion of the assumptions, see \"The \nOperating Company (KLC OpCo) - Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion\" and \"The \nReal Estate Company (KLC PropCo) - Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion.\" Our \nability to perform as projected depends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty \nand our performance could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in \n\"Risk Factors\" elsewhere in this Memorandum.

RISK FACTORS \nInvestment in the Units involves a substantial degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. As a \nresult, the purchase of the Units should be considered only by persons who can reasonably afford a loss \nof their entire investment. Prospective investors should carefully consider, in addition to matters set forth \nelsewhere in this Memorandum, the following factors relating to the business of the Company and this \noffering. The order in which risk factors appear is not intended as an indication of the relative weight or \nimportance thereof. Prospective investors should carefully review all risk factors. Such information is \npresented as of the date hereof and is subject to change without notice. The discussion in this \nMemorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results \nmay differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could \ncause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. The \noccurrence of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of \noperations or cash flow. Risks described herein that could affect KLC are also likely to be similar for other \npre-K-12 businesses we may acquire or develop. Other businesses we acquire or develop in foreign \ncountries or in different markets, may be subject to risks in addition to those discussed below. \n6.1. Risks Related to Our Business \n6.1.1 Risks associated with growth through acquisitions; potential inability to \nconsummate transactions \nA principal component of the Company's growth strategy is the acquisition of other businesses or interests \ntherein that will complement and/or expand the Company's businesses and the products and services that \nthey offer. The successful implementation of this strategy will depend upon a number of factors, including \nthe ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, consummate such transactions on favorable \nterms and integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the Company. Identifying, \ncompleting and realizing on attractive acquisitions are highly competitive and involves a high degree of \nuncertainty. The Company will be competing for acquisitions with other companies, private equity firms, \nas well as individuals and others, which often results in increased acquisition prices. There can be no \nassurance that the Company will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or that if identified, \nthe Company will be able to consummate such transactions on suitable terms, or that acquired \nbusinesses will perform as expected or generate returns. \nIn addition to risks facing education companies similar to those facing KLC as described herein, \nacquisitions of businesses also involve special risks, including risks associated with unanticipated \nliabilities and contingencies, diversion of Company management attention and possible adverse effects \non earnings resulting from increased amortization of goodwill, increased interest costs, the issuance of \nadditional securities and difficulties related to the integration of the acquired business. No assurance can \nbe given as to the success of the Company in executing and integrating acquisitions in the future. The \nCompany's failure or inability to successfully implement and manage its acquisition strategy would have a \nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and business. \nThe Company may from time to time enter into negotiations in anticipation of consummating an \nacquisition transaction. However, there is no assurance that such negotiations will be successful and the \ndiversion of management attention on such unsuccessful transactions may adversely affect \nmanagements ability to pursue other business opportunities. \nIn addition, KLC PropCo intends to acquire diversified real estate interests, including investments in non-\neducation related properties. The performance of this acquisition strategy in general, or of any particular \nproperty, cannot be predicted. \n44 \n\fThe initial closing of this offering will require a minimum investment (including the amount attributable to \nKUE LLC through conversion of its preferred limited partner units, including accrued dividends at the \noption of KUE LLC, into Common LP Units) of U.S. $280.0 million. There can be no assurance of \nadditional closings after the initial closing of the offering, whether before the completion of the Offering \nPeriod on March 31, 2007 or thereafter. Unless there are subsequent closings or offerings, cash \navailable for acquisitions and expansion would be limited to available cash of KLC and KUE and proceeds \nof future financings of KLC and KUE. \n6.1.2 The Company plans to acquire or invest in non-U.S. companies. This \ninternational expansion strategy is untested, and may include acquisitions or \ndevelopments in countries where for-profit education is not well established \nForeign acquisitions involve certain risks not typically associated with U.S. acquisitions, including risks \nrelating to (i) currency exchange matters, including fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. \ndollar and the various foreign currencies in which the Company's non-U.S. interests are denominated, \nand costs associated with conversion from one currency into another; (ii) differences between the U.S. \nand foreign securities markets, including potential price volatility in and relative illiquidity of some foreign \nsecurities markets, the absence of uniform accounting and financial reporting standards and disclosure \nrequirements and less governmental supervision and regulation; (Hi) certain economic and political risks, \nincluding potential restrictions on foreign acquisition and repatriation of capital, and the risks of political, \neconomic or social instability and the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; (iv) the possible \nimposition of foreign taxes on income and gains; and (v) differences in applicable legal systems, including \nthe possibility that the Company may experience difficulty in asserting legal claims or obtaining legal \nremedies against sellers of businesses in foreign jurisdictions. \nThe Company's prior operating history is limited to its U.S.-based businesses. Historical results may not \nbe indicative of future performance outside the U.S. The Company's non-U.S. businesses may operate in \ncountries in which the legal and regulatory frameworks, customary business models, education practices \nand philosophies and political and social norms are substantially different from those in the U.S. \nInternational expansion may also involve significant market risks, and opportunities to realize synergies \nmay be limited. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its international \nexpansion strategy. \nIn addition, the Company may acquire businesses or pursue business development opportunities in \ncountries where for-profit education is not well-established, which may involve greater risks than those \nassociated with similar U.S. acquisitions and developments. For example, the performance of a for-profit \neducation company located in a country where for-profit education is in an embryonic stage may be \nvolatile. Such a company also may be unable to achieve the growth or success achieved by education \nbusinesses in countries, such as the U.S., where for-profit education is more established. In addition, \nthere can be no assurance that for-profit education will ever become well-established or maintain viability \nin any given country. If any of the above events occur, the Company may suffer a partial or total loss of \ncapital invested in that business or development. \n6.1.3 The Company's success depends on its ability to attract and retain skilled \nemployees \nThe success of the Company will depend in part on continued employment of senior management and \nother key personnel, particularly the Principals. See the discussion under the heading \"The Company \nmay not engage in certain businesses\" below. If one or more senior management or key personnel \nbecome unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, the business and operations of the \nCompany would be disrupted. \nThe success of the Company also depends on attracting and retaining highly trained financial, marketing \nand other personnel. The Company will need to continue to hire additional personnel as its business \ngrows. The market for hiring such personnel is competitive and hiring such personnel may require \nincreased salaries and enhanced benefits under certain circumstances. A shortage in the number of \n45 \n\fskilled personnel could limit the ability of the Company to increase sales of existing products and services \nand launch new product offerings. \n6.1.4 The Company has significant leverage, and expects to incur additional debt, \nwhich could result in adverse effects on its financial condition \nThe Company has significant leverage and expects to incur additional debt in connection with the \nacquisition and operation of its businesses. Although the Company intends to use leverage in a manner it \nbelieves to be prudent, the leveraged capital structure the Company plans to utilize may significantly \nincrease the Company's exposure to adverse economic factors such as rising interest rates, downturns in \nthe economy or deteriorations in the condition of the businesses or their respective industries. If a \nbusiness cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet debt obligations, the Company may suffer a partial \nor total loss of capital invested in such business. \nThe Company's ability to service its substantial indebtedness, and meet its other obligations depends on \nits future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of \nwhich are outside the Company's control. The Company cannot be certain that its cash flow will be \nsufficient for such purposes. If the Company does not have enough liquidity, it may be required to \nrefinance all or part of its existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money. The Company cannot \nguarantee that it will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of existing or \nfuture debt agreements, may restrict the Company from pursuing any of these alternatives. \nThe substantial level of indebtedness incurred by the Company may have the following consequences of \npotential concern to investors in the Company: \n• The Company must use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay interest and \nprincipal on its indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other business purposes such \nas capital expenditures; \n• The Company's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, \nacquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired; \n• The Company may be limited in its ability to borrow additional funds; \n• The Company may have a higher level of indebtedness than some of its competitors, which may \nput it at a competitive disadvantage and reduce its flexibility in planning for, or responding to, \nchanging conditions in its industry, including increased competition; and \n• The Company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments than it \nwould without the leverage. \nAdverse developments in the Company's financial condition would have adverse effects upon the \nbusiness and results of the Company as a whole. \n6.1.5 The Company faces intense competition in the early childhood care and \neducation services industry from numerous other types of providers \nThe early childhood care and education services industry is competitive and highly fragmented. The most \nimportant competitive factors generally are quality, convenience and, to a lesser extent, price. The \nCompany's, specifically KLC OpCo's, competition in this industry consists principally of: \n• other for-profit, center-based child care providers, including franchise organizations; \n• preschool, kindergarten and before and after school programs provided by public schools; \n46 \n\f• local nursery schools and child care centers, including church-affiliated and other non-profit \ncenters; \n• providers of child care services that operate out of homes; and \n• substitutes for group child care, such as relatives, nannies and stay-at-home parents. \nIn many markets, the Company faces competition from preschool services and before and after school \nprograms offered by public schools that provide such services at little or no cost to parents. The number \nof school districts offering these services is growing, and we expect increased competition from such \nservices in the future. In addition, local nursery schools, child care centers and in-home providers \ngenerally charge less for their services than the Company. Many denominational and other non-profit \nchild care centers have lower operating expenses than the Company and may receive donations and/or \nother funding to subsidize operating expenses. Consequently, operators of such centers often charge \nlower tuition rates than us. Moreover, fees for home-based care are normally substantially lower than \nfees for center-based care. \n6.1.6 The Company may acquire companies that are not well-established or are \nexperiencing financial difficulties \nThe Company may acquire less established companies. Acquisitions of interests in such companies may \ninvolve greater risks than are generally associated with acquisitions of more established or stable \ncompanies. For example, such companies may have shorter operating histories on which to predict \nfuture performance and may have negative cash flow. Their performance may be more volatile and they \nmay be unable to sustain the growth rates or success achieved by established companies. In the case of \nstart-up enterprises, such companies may not have significant or any operating revenues. Such \ncompanies also may have a lower capitalization and fewer resources (including cash) and may be more \nvulnerable to failure, resulting in the loss of the Company's entire investment in such company. In \naddition, less mature companies could be more susceptible to irregular accounting or other fraudulent \npractices. In such event, the Company may suffer a partial or total loss of capital invested in that \ncompany. \nThe Company has invested in troubled companies in the past, and may make future investments in \ncompanies that are experiencing, or are expected to experience, financial difficulties. If such difficulties \nare not overcome, the Company may lose part or all of any equity investment in such companies. \n6.1.7 KUE will rely on the management teams of its subsidiaries \nWhile KUE will retain overall control and set the strategic direction of the Company, day-to-day operations \nat the subsidiary level will be the responsibility of the management teams at the subsidiary level. There \ncan be no assurance that the existing management teams, or any successor, of any acquired business \nwill be able to operate such business in accordance with KUE's plans and/or objectives. \n6.1.8 The Company has a non-controlling interest in k12 with limited rights as a \nshareholder and may acquire minority interests in other entities \nThe Company holds a non-controlling interest in k12 and may in the future acquire minority interests in \nother companies. Holding a minority interest limits the Company's ability to protect its interests in and to \ninfluence management of k12. Any future investments in minority interests of other companies will likely \ninvolve similar limitations. \nIn addition, the Company may co-acquire interests in businesses or develop businesses with third parties \nthrough joint ventures or other entities, which may have larger or controlling ownership interests in such \ncompanies. In such cases, the Company will rely significantly on the existing management and boards of \ndirectors of such companies, which may include representatives of other investors with whom the \nCompany is not affiliated and whose interests may at times conflict with the interests of the Company. \n47 \n\fSuch interests may involve risks in connection with such third-party involvement, including the possibility \nthat a third-party may be in a position to take (or block) action in a manner contrary to the Company's \nobjectives or may have financial difficulties resulting in a negative impact on such interest. Acquisitions \nmade with third parties in joint ventures or other entities also may involve carried interests and/or other \nfees payable to such third party partners or co-venturers. There can be no assurance that desirable \nminority shareholder rights will be available or that such rights will provide sufficient protection of the \nCompany's interests. \n6.1.9 Certain of the Company's businesses may require additional capital \nCertain of the Company's businesses, especially those in development phases, may require additional \nfinancing to satisfy their working capital requirements. The amount of the additional financing needed will \ndepend upon the maturity and objectives of the particular business. The Company may seek to raise any \nrequired capital from different sources, and subsidiaries in foreign countries may raise capital locally. The \navailability of capital is generally a function of capital market conditions that are beyond the control of the \nCompany. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to predict accurately the future \ncapital requirements necessary for success or that additional funds will be available from any source as \nneeded. An inability to timely raise capital may materially and adversely affect the Company and/or its \nbusiness. \n6.1.10 KUE's subsidiaries operate in regulated industries; failure to comply with \ngovernmental regulation and licensing requirements could have a material \nadverse effect on operations \nThe pre-K-12 education business is highly regulated and is often subsidized with government funding or \nreimbursement programs. In addition, KUE and its subsidiaries may require the consent or approval of \napplicable regulatory authorities in order to acquire or operate particular businesses, including in foreign \njurisdictions where the Company has limited or no experience with the regulatory framework. Failure to \ncomply with applicable laws or regulations, or failure or inability to obtain applicable approvals, could have \na material adverse effect on the operations of KUE and/or its subsidiaries. \nFor example, KLC's centers and school programs are subject to numerous state and local regulations and \nlicensing requirements. KLC has policies and procedures in place to assist in complying with such \nregulations and requirements. Although these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, government \nagencies generally review, among other things, the fitness and adequacy of buildings and equipment, the \nratio of staff personnel to enrolled children, staff training, record keeping, children's dietary program, the \ndaily curriculum, and compliance with health and safety standards and transportation safety. In most \njurisdictions, these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of the centers and licenses \nmust be renewed periodically. Most jurisdictions establish requirements for background checks or other \nclearance procedures for new employees of child care centers and school programs. Repeated failures \nby any of KLC's centers to comply with applicable regulations may result in sanctions against that center \nor program and other centers or programs in the same jurisdiction, including probation or, in more serious \ncases, suspension or revocation of a center's or program's license to operate. In addition, this type of \naction could attract negative publicity extending beyond that jurisdiction. \nA licensing authority may determine that a particular center or program is in violation of applicable \nregulations and may take action against that center or program and possibly other centers or programs in \nthe same jurisdiction. For more information, see The Operating Company (KLC OpCo) — Licensing and \nGovernment Regulation.\" \n6.1.11 Future legislation or new regulations may place additional burdens on the \nCompany and have a material adverse effect on operations \nAdditional, different and/or more stringent regulations and licensing requirements may become applicable \nin the future due to changes in laws and regulations, judicial or administrative interpretations of existing \nlaws and regulations, changes in the Company's business strategy or for other reasons. State authorities \n48 \n\froutinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing requirements and may implement changes that \nsignificantly increase operating costs. For example, a change in the required ratio of child center staff \npersonnel to enrolled children in a certain jurisdiction could increase KLC center or program staff \noperating expenses in that jurisdiction and therefore have a material adverse effect on KLC's operations. \nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to (i) obtain all required regulatory approvals \nthat it does not yet have or that it may require in the future; (i) obtain any necessary modifications to \nexisting regulatory approvals; or (iii) maintain required regulatory approvals. Delay in obtaining or failure \nto obtain and maintain in full force and effect any regulatory approvals, or amendments thereto, or delay \nor failure to satisfy any regulatory conditions or other applicable requirements, could prevent operation of \nthe facility or sales to third parties, or could result in additional costs to the Company. \n6.1.12 Conflicts of interest may arise with the Principals and their affiliates \nThe Principals will agree (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) that KUE will be their exclusive \nvehicle for equity investment opportunities in and acquisitions of for-profit companies engaged primarily in \nthe business of pre-K through 12th grade education of children (other than companies in which the \nPrincipals or their affiliates directly or indirectly owns fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting stock (or \nsimilar voting interests) as of the date of the first closing of the offering, which are LeapFrog Enterprises, \nInc. and Nobel Learning Communities, Inc.). The Principals will not acquire or make an equity investment \nin such companies unless such acquisition or investment opportunity has been first presented to the \nIndependent Committee and subsequently declined by the Independent Committee or initially pursued but \nlater abandoned by KUE. See \"The Structure of KUE and the General Partner — Investment in \nSubsidiaries and Joint Ventures.\" In addition, existing companies in which KULG and/or its principals are \ninvestors along with other unrelated investors may invest in or acquire companies involved in areas \nrelating to education. \nFollowing the consummation of the offering, the Principals will control the General Partner other than with \nrespect to certain actions requiring Investor approval as further described in \"The Structure of KUE and \nthe General Partner.\" Conflicts could emerge between the Principals and the Company in the future, \nincluding conflicts due to the other business segments in which the Principals may have interests, \nseparate from the Company. In addition, affiliates of the Principals will have certain financial interests in \nKUE and certain of its subsidiaries as described in \"Related Party Transactions\" following the \nconsummation of the offering independent of their ownership of the Units, which may present conflicts of \ninterest. \nCertain other potential conflicts of interest include: \n• Other activities of management — the Principals and other senior management personnel of the \nCompany are subject to a variety of prior and continuing obligations unrelated to the Company. \nAccordingly, conflicts may arise in the allocation of management time and resources. \n• Lack of separate counsel for Investors — no separate counsel has been engaged by the Company \nto act on behalf of Investors in the Company. \n• For a description of existing arrangements between the Company and its affiliates, see \"Related \nParty Transactions.\" \n• For a description of certain restrictions on one of the Principals and the Company, see \"The \nCompany may not engage in certain businesses\" below. \nBy acquiring an interest in the Company, each Investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the \nexistence of any such actual or potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect to \nany liability arising from the existence of any such conflict of interest. \n49 \n\f6.1.13 The Company may not engage in certain businesses \nOn February 24, 1998, without admitting or denying liability, Michael R. Milken consented to the entry of a \nfinal judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in Securities and Exchange \nCommission v. Michael R. Milken et al., which judgment was entered on February 26, 1998 restraining \nand enjoining Michael Milken from associating with any broker, dealer, investment advisor, investment \ncompany or municipal securities dealer, and from violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act \nof 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). On March 11, 1991, in the action entitled In the Matter of \nMichael R. Milken, the SEC instituted a proceeding pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and \nordered that Michael Milken be barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment advisor, \ninvestment company or municipal securities dealer. On April 24, 1990, concurrently with a plea agreement \ncovering criminal violations of federal securities laws, Michael Milken also consented, without admitting or \ndenying liability, to the entry of a final judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Drexel Burnham Lambert \nIncorporated, et al., restraining and enjoining Michael Milken from engaging in transactions, acts, \npractices and courses of business which constitute or would constitute violations of, or which aid and abet \nor would aid and abet violations of, Sections 7(c), 7(f), 9(a)(2), 10(b), 13(d), 14(e), 15(c)(3) and 17(a)(1) of \nthe Exchange Act, and Regulations T and X and Rules 10b-5, 10b-6, 13d-1, 13d-2, 14e-3, 15c3-1, 17a-3 \nand 17a-4 promulgated thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. \nThe Company cannot be in the business of or associated with a broker, dealer, investment company, \ninvestment advisor, or municipal securities dealer (collectively, \"prohibited businesses\"). As a result, the \nCompany cannot pursue any acquisitions or investments that may have the effect of the Company being \nin any prohibited business. This could adversely affect the Company's ability to make and/or hold \ninvestments or acquisitions which may otherwise be consistent with its business objectives. \n6.1.14 Litigation and adverse publicity concerning alleged incidents at KLC or other \nchild care centers could hurt KLC's reputation \nKLC is subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims and \nlitigation involving allegations of physical or sexual abuse of children. Any such allegations, claims or \nlawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on KLC OpCo's \nfinancial position, operating results or cash flows. \nPersonal trust and parent referrals play a key role in the child care business. KLC believes its success is \ndirectly related to its reputation and favorable brand identity. KLC is periodically subject to claims and \nlitigation alleging negligence, inadequate supervision and other grounds for liability arising from injuries or \nother harm to children. In addition, claimants may seek damages from KLC for child abuse, sexual abuse \nor other criminal acts arising out of alleged incidents at KLC's centers. There are lengthy statute of \nlimitations periods applicable to child abuse and personal injury claims. Such claims may typically be \nbrought until a number of years after a claimant reaches the age of majority. Any adverse publicity \nconcerning such incidents at one of KLC's child care centers, or child care centers generally, could greatly \ndamage KLC's reputation and could have an adverse effect on occupancy levels at KLC's centers. \n6.1.15 KLC's insurance policies may be inadequate to cover claims, and KLC may be \nunable to maintain existing coverage in the future at reasonable prices \nSome operators of child care centers have experienced difficulty obtaining general liability insurance or \nother liability insurance that covers child abuse. KLC maintains insurance policies to protect against \nrelevant liability exposures in amounts KLC considers to be appropriate. In addition, KLC's owned \ncenters are covered by blanket insurance policies, including property insurance. Although KLC has not \nhistorically had to pay any claims exceeding its coverage, claims in excess of, or not included within, its \ncoverage may be asserted. To the extent that any claims are not covered by insurance, KLC will be \nforced to cover the associated costs itself, which will reduce the amount of cash KLC has available for \nother business purposes. \n50 \n\fInsurance premiums have increased significantly in the past and may increase in the future because of \nmarket conditions in the insurance business generally, conditions in the child care industry more \nparticularly or KLC's situation specifically. KLC cannot be certain of the cost or coverage it will obtain with \nreplacements of existing policies, which will depend on the factors described above. \n6.1.16 Factors beyond the Company's control, such as economic conditions, may \nadversely affect the demand for child care services \nDemand for child care services is subject to fluctuations in general economic conditions, and the \nCompany's revenues depend, in part, on the number of working mothers and working single parents who \nrequire child care services. Recessionary pressure on the economy, and a consequent reduction in the \ngeneral labor force, may adversely impact the Company because out-of-work parents tend to stop using \nchild care services. In addition, certain demographic trends which are favorable to the Company's \nbusiness, including the increasing percentage of mothers in the workforce and the growth in population of \nchildren of the age needing child care, as well as trends in the preference of working parents and \nemployers for center based child care, may not continue. Other factors beyond the Company's control \ncould adversely affect demand, such as terrorism, natural disasters and epidemics. \nChildren attending KLC's facilities are generally enrolled on a weekly basis. Accordingly, any change in \neconomic conditions or other external factors affecting demand will impact us more quickly than \nbusinesses with longer contractual periods. \n6.1.17 A loss or reduction of government funding for child care assistance programs or \nfood reimbursement programs could adversely affect KLC \nFederal and state child care assistance programs accounted for approximately 20% of KLC's revenues \nduring the one year period ended December 31, 2005. These funds are primarily from the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant and At Risk Programs, which are designed to assist low-income families \nwith child care expenses and are administered through various state agencies. Although additional \nfunding for child care may be available for low income families as part of welfare reform and the \nreauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant and At Risk Programs, KLC may not \nbenefit from any such additional funding. \nKLC is eligible to participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program, or CACFP, which provides \nreimbursement for meals and snacks that meet certain USDA approved nutritional guidelines. Centers \ncan qualify to participate in the CACFP by meeting one of two tests: 25% or more of the enrolled students \nreceive child care assistance funding or 25% or more of the center's customers have household incomes \nthat are at or below state specified income levels. Reimbursement is calculated based on the percentage \nof the center's customers that fall into a \"free\" or \"reduced\" income category established by the state. \nFederal or state child care assistance programs may not continue to be funded at current levels, \nparticularly with large budget deficits putting pressure on discretionary spending programs. In addition, \nmany states have recently experienced fiscal problems and have reduced or may in the future reduce \nspending on social services. A termination or reduction in funding of child care assistance programs \ncould have a material adverse effect on KLC's business. \nAdverse changes to the national or local economies may result in an increase in the number of families \neligible for child care assistance. In order to compensate for such increases, state or local governments \nhave in the past, and may in the future, increased parent co-payments required under such programs or \nchange the eligibility requirements to reduce the number of families eligible to participate in such \nprograms. An increase in the required parent co-payments may discourage parents from sending their \nchildren to KLC's centers. An increase in required parent co-payments also increases KLC's exposure to \nthe risk of non-payment by these parents. \nIn addition, states which reduce funding for child care may be unable to qualify to receive funds under the \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program. Such states may utilize funds under the \n51 \n\fChild Care and Development Block Grant to provide child care assistance to needy families in lieu of \nTANF funds, thereby reducing the amount of funds available to other families, including families that \nutilize KLC's child care centers. \n6.1.18 A termination or reduction of tax credits for child care could have a material \nadverse effect on KLC's business \nKLC may enjoy heightened demand for its services because of tax incentives for child care programs. \nSection 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to herein as the \"Code\"), \nprovides a federal income tax credit ranging from 20% to 35% of specified child care expenses with \nmaximum eligible expenses of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children. The fees paid to \nKLC by eligible taxpayers for child care services qualify for these tax credits, subject to the limitations of \nSection 21 of the Code. However, these tax incentives are subject to change. \nCode Section 45F provides incentives to employers to offset costs related to employer provided child care \nfacilities. Costs related to (a) acquiring or constructing property used as a qualified child care center, (b) \noperating an existing child care center, or (c) contracting with an independent child care operator to care \nfor the children of the taxpayer's employees will qualify for the credit. The credit amount is 25% of the \nqualified costs. An additional credit of 10% of qualified expenses for child care resource and referral \nservices has also been enacted. The maximum credit available for any taxpayer is $150,000 per tax year. \nMany states offer tax credits in addition to the federal credits discussed above. Credit programs vary by \nstate and may apply to both the individual taxpayer and the employer. A termination or reduction of such \ntax credits could have a material adverse effect on KLC's business. \n6.1.19 Material weaknesses in KLC's internal controls were discovered during KLC's \n2005 audit \nFor a discussion of certain material weaknesses in KLC's internal controls discovered in KLC's 2005 audit, \nsee \"KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for \nthe Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003\" in Appendix B. To address these issues, and as part of \nthe Company's growth plan, KLC is increasing expenditures on IT systems and accounting and IT \npersonnel. \n6.1.20 If KLC is unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees, if \nminimum wage rates increase or if KLC's employees unionize, KLC's results of \noperations may be adversely affected \nKLC believes that its success is largely dependent on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees. \nMany of KLC's child care center staff are entry level wage earning employees, and turnover in this \nindustry has traditionally been significant. If KLC is unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified \nemployees (particularly center directors and supervising employees) or are only able to hire or retain such \nemployees by providing significantly greater salaries, wages and benefits than KLC currently does as a \nresult of increases in the federal or state minimum wage rates or other market conditions, KLC's \noperations may be adversely affected. \nSince early 1998, union organization efforts in the child care industry have received considerable \npublicity. While union officials associated with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees and Service Employees International have repeatedly announced their intention to engage in \na nation-wide effort to organize child care workers, organization efforts have been focused on \ngovernment-funded providers. To date, efforts to organize employees of for-profit providers have been \nminimal. However, organizational efforts may occur and, if successful, could have an adverse effect on \nKLC's relationships with employees and KLC's labor costs. In addition, the general publicity surrounding \nsuch efforts, even if not focused on KLC's centers, could result in increased wages for child care workers \nand, as a result, increase KLC's labor costs. \n52 \n\f6.1.21 Because KLC (through KLC PropCo) owns or leases a substantial number of real \nproperties, and expects to invest in additional properties, results of operations \ncould be adversely affected if environmental contamination is discovered on any \nof the properties \nKLC is subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that may \nimpose liability for damages resulting from past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous \nsubstances as well as clean up costs. In particular, under applicable environmental laws, KLC may be \nresponsible for investigating and remediating environmental conditions and may be subject to associated \nliability, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, relating to KLC's properties. These obligations \ncould arise whether KLC owns or leases the property at issue and regardless of whether the \nenvironmental conditions were created by KLC or by a prior owner or tenant. Environmental conditions \nunknown to KLC at this time relating to prior, existing or future properties may be discovered and may \nhave a material adverse effect on KLC's results of operations. \n6.1.22 KUE has a limited history \nWhile certain subsidiaries of KUE have a financial and an operating history, KUE has only recently been \norganized and has relatively little financial or operating history upon which prospective investors may \nevaluate its performance, and has not prepared separate or consolidated financial statements. The prior \nperformance of the subsidiaries of KUE described herein may not be indicative of the future results of the \nCompany. \n6.2. Tax Risks \n6.2.1 Certain tax considerations generally applicable to Investors subject to U.S. tax \nliability \nKUE is expected to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each Investor that \nis subject to U.S. federal income tax liability will take into account its allocable share of items of income, \ngain, loss, deduction, and credit of KUE (as determined under the Limited Partnership Agreement), \nwithout regard to whether it has received distributions from KUE. As a result, the tax liability to an \nInvestor resulting from such allocation may exceed the cash distributions made by KUE to the Investor. \nFurther, upon the sale of its Common LP Units, an Investor may, depending on the amount of Company \ndebt, if any, and the Investor's adjusted tax basis, incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash \nreceived. \nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\"), or other taxing authority may challenge the manner in \nwhich income, gains, losses and deductions are allocated to holders of Common LP Units, the General \nPartner and holders of the Profits Participation LP Units under the Limited Partnership Agreement. For \nU.S. federal income tax purposes, allocation of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction to a partner in \na partnership will be given effect so long as the allocation has \"substantial economic effect,\" or is \notherwise in accordance with the partner's interest in the partnership. If an allocation of an item pursuant \nto the Limited Partnership Agreement does not satisfy this standard or is deemed not to satisfy this \nstandard by the IRS, it will be reallocated by the IRS among the Partners on the basis of their respective \ninterests in KUE (as determined by the IRS), taking into account all facts and circumstances. In such a \ncase, Investors could have additional tax liabilities or suffer adverse tax consequences. \nAn investment in KUE will give rise to a variety of complex U.S. federal income tax and other tax issues \nfor Investors. Certain of those issues may relate to special rules applicable to certain types of Investors \nsubject to U.S. tax, such as tax-exempt entities, foundations, life insurance companies, banks, dealers, in \nsecurities, U.S. persons who own 10% or more of KUE and non-U.S. persons and entities. Prospective \nInvestors are urged to consult their tax advisors with specific reference to their situations concerning an \ninvestment in KUE. \n53 \n\f6.2.2 Tax-Exempt and Non-U.S. Investors may become subject to U.S. Tax \nKUE business activities could generate income that will be taxable to certain otherwise tax-exempt \nInvestors as \"unrelated business taxable income.\" Although, under the Limited Partnership Agreement, \nthe General Partner is required to use its reasonable best efforts not to engage in, or invest in (other than \nthrough an entity that is not a pass-through entity) a pass-through entity that engages in, any activity \nwhich constitutes the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and generates income which \nconstitutes \"effectively connected income\" in the hands of the non-U.S. Investors that own Common LP \nUnits, it is possible that some of KUE's business activities and acquisitions could generate income that is \n\"effectively connected\" with a U.S. trade or business which could create U.S. federal income tax reporting, \ntax liability, and tax withholding for non-U.S. Investors. Additionally, KUE believes that neither KUE nor \nits subsidiaries is currently a U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation (\"USRPHC\") for U.S. federal income \ntax purposes. However, no assurances can be given in this regard. Furthermore, it is possible that in the \nfuture KUE and/or its subsidiaries may become a USRPHC if, for example, the value of the U.S. real \nestate holdings of KUE or such subsidiary increases sufficiently. A disposition of an interest in a \nUSRPHC could create gain for non-U.S. Investors which would be treated as if the non-U.S. Investor \nwere engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. and as if such gain were effectively connected with \nsuch trade or business. This would create U.S. federal income tax reporting, tax liability and withholding \nfor non-U.S. Investors. Investors that are non-U.S. persons are urged to consult their tax advisors \nregarding the potential application of the USRPHC rules to their investment in KUE. \n6.2.3 Investors may become subject to taxation in non-U.S. jurisdictions \nKUE expects to make investments in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., and KUE, its subsidiaries and/or the \nInvestors may be subject to income or other tax in those jurisdictions. In addition, local tax incurred in \nnon-U.S. jurisdictions by KUE or subsidiaries through which it invests may not entitle Investors to either (i) \na credit against tax that may be owed in the U.S. or their respective local tax jurisdictions, or (ii) a \ndeduction against income taxable in the U.S. or such local jurisdictions by the Investors. \n6.2.4 Controlled Foreign Corporations \nKUE anticipates that it and/or its subsidiaries will invest in non-U.S. operations. Depending upon the \npercentage of ownership of such operations by KUE and its subsidiaries and the type of legal entity \nchosen for such operations, these non-U.S. operations could be classified as a Controlled Foreign \nCorporation (\"CFC\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an entity is classified as a CFC, certain \ntypes of income could be taxable to U.S. persons owning 10% or more of KUE for U.S. income tax \npurposes, even if no distributions of cash are made from such entity, and gain from the disposition of \nsuch entity would be taxed as if it were a dividend to the extent of such entity's earnings and profits, \nrather than as a capital gain, for U.S. income tax purposes. \n6.2.5 Treatment of KUE as a U.S. Entity \nUnder the Code, certain non-U.S corporations may be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal \nincome tax purposes, thereby subjecting such non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income tax on their \nincome. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation includes one such provision. Under this legislation, \nreferred to as the anti-inversion legislation, non-U.S. corporations that acquire interests in a U.S. \ncorporation or partnership and meet certain ownership, operational and other tests may be treated as U.S. \ncorporations for federal income tax purposes. The legislation grants broad regulatory authority to the U.S. \nSecretary of Treasury to provide such regulations as may be appropriate to determine whether a non-U.S. \ncorporation is treated as a U.S. corporation or as are necessary to carry out the intent of the provision, \nincluding adjusting its application as necessary to prevent the avoidance of its purpose. Recently issued \nTreasury regulations provide that the anti-inversion legislation is applicable to a foreign partnership that is \nor becomes a \"publicly traded partnership\" within two years of the acquisition by it of a U.S. corporation. \nA \"publicly traded partnership\" is any partnership (i) interests in which are traded on an established \nsecurities market, or (ii) interests in which are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial \nequivalent thereof). KUE believes that it is not currently a publicly traded partnership and does not intend \n54 \n\fto become a publicly traded partnership within two years of this offering or the acquisition of KLC and k12. \nAs a result, KUE does not believe the anti-inversion legislation or any regulations promulgated within the \nscope of the legislation's regulatory authority should apply to KUE although no assurance can be given in \nthis regard or with respect to any new acquisitions of or investments in U.S. corporations. In addition, \nKUE does not believe that any other Code provision subjecting non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal \nincome tax should apply to KUE or its subsidiaries, although no assurance can be in this regards. The \npromulgation of contrary regulations or a successful challenge of either of these positions by the Internal \nRevenue Service could materially reduce a holder's after-tax return and, thus, could result in a substantial \nreduction of the value of the Units. \n6.2.6 Currency Fluctuations \nAn investment in KUE is a U.S. dollar denominated investment. Contributions to and distributions from \nKUE will be made in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in value between the U.S. dollar and the Investor's \nfunctional currency (if other than the U.S. dollar) may result in taxable income to the Investor. \n6.2.7 Reporting Requirements \nInvestors who are U.S. Persons will be required to file an IRS Form 8865 with the Investor's U.S. federal \nincome tax return for the taxable year in which the Investor purchases the Common LP Units. Investors \nwho are U.S. Persons may, depending upon the size of their investment in the General Partner, be \nrequired to file an IRS Form 5471 with the Investor's U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year in \nwhich the Investor purchases Class A ordinary shares in the General Partner. Additionally, depending on \nthe type of non-U.S. investments KUE makes, Investors who are U.S. Persons may be required to file \nadditional IRS Forms such as a Form 5471 in subsequent years. \n6.3. Risks Related to Projections \n6.3.1 The projections included in this Memorandum and otherwise provided to \npotential Investors are subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties; \npotential Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such projections \nThe projections included in this Memorandum and other models and forecasts that may be presented to \nor discussed with Investors represent management's best estimates as of the date of this Memorandum \nof KLC's, KLC OpCo's and KLC PropCo's projected results of operations for the years ended December \n31, 2006 to 2011 (the \"Projections\"). The Projections were not prepared with a view toward compliance \nwith published guidelines of the SEC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or any \nregulatory or professional agency or body or generally accepted accounting principles of the U.S. or any \nother country. In addition, neither the Agents, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's independent \nauditors, nor any other independent expert, accountant or counsel has examined, reviewed or compiled \nthe Projections and, consequently, assume no responsibility for them. The Projections should be read \ntogether with, and are qualified in their entirety by, the information contained in the rest of this \"Risk \nFactors\" section, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC's Pro Forma Results of Operations,\" \n\"Business\" and the financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this Memorandum. \nThe Projections do not include any expenses of any entity within the Company above the KLC level, \nincluding KUE expenses ($17.5 million of the $20.0 million payable pursuant to the Fixed Overhead \nPayment Agreement) that will be payable by KUE for administrative and other services. See \"Related \nParty Transactions.\" The Projections also do not include any projected expenses relating to grants of \nProfits Participation Units or other equity-related grants, including for the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan \nat Knowledge Schools, Inc. (\"KSI\"), pursuant to which payments may be made based on different \nvaluations of KSI stock and are based on the same multiples of Adjusted EBITDA used in 2005; actual \nvaluations are conducted annually and may be higher or lower. Finally, the Projections do not reflect \nprojected interest expenses on KUE debt. \n55 \n\fThe Projections do not assume that the Company will make any future material acquisitions, even though \nthe Company expects to use the proceeds of the sale of the Units, among other purposes, for \nacquisitions, which will likely affect actual performance and cause it to differ from the Projections. The \nProjections assume the success of the Company's operating strategy, although no assurance can be \ngiven that the Company's strategy will be effective or that the anticipated benefits from the strategy will be \nrealized in the periods for which the Projections have been prepared. The assumptions described herein \nare those that the Company believes are most significant to the Projections; however, not all assumptions \nused in preparing the Projections have been set forth herein. \nThe Projections, in general, assume that: (i) the Company will not be negatively or positively impacted by \nany material legal proceedings; (ii) there will be no material change in any of the Company's existing \ncontracts or leases; (iii) there will be no change in generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. \nthat will have a material effect on the financial results of the Company; (iv) there will be no labor disputes, \nnatural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics (such as avian flu) or other disturbances that would \nmaterially affect the operations or revenues of the Company; and (v) that worldwide economic conditions \nand economic conditions in the U.S. remain generally favorable and consistent with those prevailing on \nthe date of this Memorandum. \nThe Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered \nreasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive \nrisks, uncertainties and contingencies which are beyond the control of KLC, and upon assumptions with \nrespect to future business decisions which are subject to change. Accordingly, the Projections are only \nan estimate, and actual results will vary from the Projections, and these variations may be material. \nConsequently, the inclusion of the Projections herein should not be regarded as a representation of the \nCompany, its advisors, the Agents, or any other person of results that will actually be achieved. \nProjections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it is usually the case that one or more of the \nassumptions in projections do not materialize. Prospective purchasers of the Units are cautioned not to \nplace undue reliance on the Projections. \nThe limited k12 projections contained in this Memorandum were received from k12 management and \nwere not prepared by the Company or its management. \nThe Company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to reflect circumstances \nexisting after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that \nany or all of the underlying assumptions do not come to fruition. Furthermore, the Company does not \nintend to update or revise the Projections to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. \n6.4. Risks Related to Investing in the Units \n6.4.1 There will be significant unallocated net proceeds from the offering \nIf there are additional closings after the initial closing of the offering, after repayment of KUE's debt, a \nsignificant amount of the anticipated net proceeds from the offering of the Units may not have been \ndesignated for specific uses. Therefore, the Company's management will have broad discretion within \nthe business scope of the Company with respect to the use of the net proceeds of the offering. There can \nbe no assurance that the uses of proceeds will benefit the Company or Investors. \n6.4.2 Investors will only have limited rights to receive ongoing information about the \nCompany \nOther than as expressly provided in the Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE (the \"Limited Partnership \nAgreement), the Company does not expect to provide ongoing detailed information regarding its \nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations to Investors. The Limited Partnership Agreement \nprovides that Investors shall receive yearly audited financial statements of the Company, as well as semi-\n56 \n\fannual reports on the Company's operations. In addition, Investors have the right to access certain other \ninformation regarding the Company as provided for in the Limited Partnership Agreement. As long as the \nUnits are not registered under the Exchange Act, the Company will not be subject to the reporting \nrequirements thereunder. KLC's 2005 audit was not completed until May 2006 due to systems \nconversion issues. \n6.4.3 Investors may never receive cash distributions on their investment; there is no \nassurance of investment return \nThere is no assurance that KUE will be able to generate returns for the Investors or that returns will be \ncommensurate with the risks of investing in KUE. There may be limited or no cash flow available to KUE \nfrom its subsidiaries or to the Investors from KUE and there can be no assurance that KUE will make any \ndistributions to Investors. KUE is not obligated to declare cash distributions with respect to the Units \nother than certain distributions to meet tax obligations of the Investors. Public offerings, sales or other \ndispositions which may result in a return of capital or the realization of gains, if any, are not expected to \noccur for a number of years. An investment in KUE should only be considered by persons who can \nreasonably afford a loss of their entire investment. \n6.4.4 KUE's ability to make distributions is limited by its subsidiaries' existing and \nfuture indebtedness \nKUE will not have any material assets other than its ownership of various subsidiaries (including KLC) \nand investments in other companies, and will not have any material operations or revenues other than \nincome derived from KUE's interest in its subsidiaries and any proceeds arising from its investments in \nother companies. Therefore, KUE's ability to make any distributions to Investors will be completely \ndependent on the operations and business results of its subsidiaries and its investment holdings. \nKLC's ability to make distributions or payments to KUE is restricted by the provisions of its various debt \nagreements, including without limitation, the Indenture, dated as of February 2, 2005, by and between \nKLC, the Guarantors, as defined therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. Therefore, KLC may be \nprevented from making distributions or payments to KUE as and when needed by KUE. Such restrictions \nmay adversely affect the business and operations of KUE as a whole and the value of any investment in \nKUE. Similar restrictions may apply to future indebtedness incurred by KLC and other subsidiaries of \nKUE. \n6.4.5 There is no public market for, and Investors may be unable to sell, the Units \nThere is no public trading market for the Units and one is not expected to develop. The economic risks of \nthis investment must be borne for an indefinite period of time. Neither the Units nor the underlying \nCommon LP Units or Class A Shares will be registered under the Securities Act or under any state \nsecurities laws (or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction). Each Investor will be required to \nrepresent that it is purchasing the Units for its own account for investment purposes and not with a view to \nresale or distribution. Although the General Partner intends to approve permitted transfers specified in \nthe LPA, and not to unreasonably withhold consent to transfers, all transfers require the prior approval of \nthe General Partner under Caymans Law, and no transfer of the Units may be made unless the transfer \ncomplies with the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement. Although the Limited Partnership \nAgreement of KUE and the organizational documents of the General Partner permit the foregoing \ntransfers and the General Partner has agreed with certain Investors to approve such transfers, applicable \nCayman Islands law gives the General Partner full discretion to approve or disapprove transfers. \nEach transfer must be registered under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an \nexemption must be available. These restrictions will be noted on a legend placed on each certificate, if \nany, representing the Units. As a precondition to the effectiveness of any transfer, the Company may \nrequire the transferor to provide an opinion of legal counsel stating that the transfer is in accordance with \nthe Securities Act and to pay any costs the Company incurs in connection with the transfer. It is not \ncurrently contemplated that the Units will be registered under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or \n57 \n\fother securities laws. In addition, certain provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which permit \nthe resale, subject to various terms and conditions, of restricted securities after they have been held for \none year, do not apply to the Units because the Company is not required to file and does not file, current \nreports under the Exchange Act and does not, and does not intend to, make comparable information \npublicly available. \n6.4.6 Purchasers of the Units are subject to Dilution \nAlthough we have not prepared a consolidated balance sheet for KUE, prior to this offering and the \nconversion of $180 million of KUE's preferred limited partner units currently held by the Principals and \ntheir affiliates into Common LP Units at the per Common LP Unit issuance price, we expect that KUE \nwould have negative or nominally positive common equity book value due to its historical capital structure, \nincluding its level of indebtedness. As a result, the book value per Unit acquired in this offering will be \nsubstantially less after this offering than the purchase price paid by the Investors. The Investors interests \nare also subject to future dilution if and to the extent the Company grants options, profits interest units or \nsimilar rights to officers, directors or employees of the Company, and will also be affected by any awards \nby the Company under the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan described \nunder \"Management Incentive Plans and Employment Agreements.\" Investors will have a Co-invest Right \nto purchase a pro-rata portion of certain issuances of Units by the Company for cash; however, such right \nis subject to customary exceptions. See \"The Structure of KUE and the General Partner.\" \n6.4.7 KUE and the General Partner are not U.S. entities; disputes must be resolved by \nbinding arbitration in the United Kingdom \nKUE will be a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The General Partner is a Cayman Islands \nexempted company. The internal governance of KUE will be pursuant to the Limited Partnership \nAgreement in compliance with applicable laws of the Cayman Islands. The internal governance of the \nGeneral Partner will be pursuant to the Memorandum and Articles of Association and the agreement \namong members in compliance with applicable laws of the Cayman Islands. All disputes under the \napplicable agreements or related to this offering must be resolved through binding arbitration conducted \nin the United Kingdom under the London Court of International Arbitration Rules. Such laws and Rules \nmay offer less or different protections to Investors than laws applicable to comparable U.S. entities or \nlaws of the Investors' home countries. \n6.4.8 The Company will not be operated to optimize the investment, tax or other \nobjectives of any individual Investor \nThe Investors may have conflicting investment, tax and other interests with respect to their investments in \nthe Company. The conflicting interests of individual Investors may relate to or arise from, among other \nthings, the nature of investments made by the Company and the structuring or the acquisition of \ninvestments. As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the \nGeneral Partner, including with respect to the nature or structuring of investments, that may be more \nbeneficial for one Investor than for another Investor, especially with respect to Investors' individual tax \nsituations. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for the Company, the General Partner will \nconsider the investment and tax objectives of the Company as a whole, not the investment, tax or other \nobjectives of any individual Investor. Investors must seek their own investment, tax and other advice \nconcerning an investment in the Units. \n6.4.9 The Investors may not separately transfer the constituent securities underlying \nthe Units \nThe Investors may not separately transfer Common LP Units or Class A Shares (unless otherwise \napproved by the Board of Directors of the General Partner and the Independent Committee), and there \nmay be less Investor interest in a security such as the Units than there would be in more traditional \n58 \n\fcorporate or partnership investments. This restriction may adversely affect an Investors' ability to transfer \nthe Units in the future. \n6.4.10 Under certain circumstances, the General Partner may cause an Investor's \ninterest in KUE to be redeemed or transferred \nUnder circumstances where the continuing participation in KUE by an Investor would have a material \nadverse effect on the Company, the General Partner may cause an Investor's interest in KUE to be \nredeemed or transferred. See \"Limitation of a Limited Partner's Participation\" in Section 4.11 of the \nLimited Partnership Agreement of KUE. \n59 \n\f7. DISTRIBUTION POLICY \nWe intend to retain any future earnings to fund working capital, debt service, acquisitions and growth and \ndo not expect to make distributions for the foreseeable future. Any determination to make distributions in \nthe future will be at the discretion of the General Partner and will depend upon our results of operations, \nfinancial condition and other factors, as the General Partner, in its discretion, deems relevant. Limitations \nin the credit facility and indenture of KLC restrict distributions by KLC that could, in turn, be made \navailable for future distributions by KUE to its partners. \n60 \n\f8. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW \n8.1. Human Capital \nHistorically, the world economy has been viewed as being driven by an asset base of natural resources. \nThis has shifted to an economy driven by industrial and financial resources. This perception is reinforced \nthrough the statistics and measurements used by governments, as seen in the Federal Reserve's \nrepresentation of the U.S. balance sheet. However, it is KUE's view that the real assets of a city, state, \nregion or country are its people (human capital) and their productive capacity. KUE believes that national \neconomies that fail to embrace this concept will be left behind. Nobel Prize winning economist Gary \nBecker estimates that in today's service based economy, human capital accounts for 76% of the assets in \nthe U.S. \n2005 Human Capital - $238 Trillion Market \nHuman and \nSocial Capital \n74% \nSource: Gary Becker \nSource: U.S. Federal Reserve \nUS Financial \nAssets \n26% \n2005 U.S. Balance Sheet - $62 Trillion Market \nOther Financ \n5% \nOther Tangible \n6% \nBonds \nat 4% \nImportantly in today's economy, the value of a company is increasingly driven by creativity, innovation \nand education. Companies are recognizing that human capital is their defining asset. With the value of \neducation becoming apparent to government and businesses alike, the Principals believe that a \nsignificant opportunity exists to create an education company that will promote and cultivate human \ncapital. Today, not a single education company ranks in the top 100 worldwide as measured by market \ncapitalization. Within 20 years, KUE believes that the education space will contain some of the largest \ncompanies in the world. \n8.1.1 Enhancing Human Capital through Education \nEducation is a primary factor in improving an individual's life-long productivity. Studies have shown that a \nhigher level of education leads to increased lifetime earnings, and that this is increasingly true in the new, \nknowledge economy. \n61 \n\fAs shown below, an individual with a professional degree earns approximately 100% more than a college \ngraduate and an individual with a bachelor's degree earns approximately 70% more than a high school \ngraduate in their lifetime. \nEducation and Wage Disparity: Lifetime Earnings (Ages 18-64) \n$6.0 \n$5.0 \n$4.0 \ng. $3.0 \n$2.0 \n$1.0 \n$0.0 \n$4.2 \n$2.3 \n$1.4 \n$5.3 \n$2.7 \n$1.6 \n1991 1995 1999 2003 \nProfessional Degree - \nSource: U.S. Census Bureau. \n- Bachelor's Degree ______High School Diploma \nDespite the results of the study shown above, 35% of Americans over the age of 18 have not graduated \nhigh school.

Heckman's study asserts, \n\"The rate of return to a dollar investment made while a person is young is higher than the rate of return to \nthe same dollar made at a later age,\" as illustrated below: \nReturn \nPreschool \nSchool \nOpportunity \nCost of Funds \nJob Training \nSchool Post School \nAge \nSource: August 2002 study, James Heckman, University of Chicago. \nDue to the high rate of return of investments in ECE and the principles underlying the theory of human \ncapital, KUE has made its largest initial investment in KLC, the largest company serving the ECE market \nin the world. \n16 Source: U.S. Census Bureau. \n62 \n\f8.2. The Education Market \nEducation is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross \nnational income of $48 trillion.17 In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1.0 trillion market with for-\nprofit education accounting for $81 billion or 7.8% of this amount.18 The for-profit component of this \nindustry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate training) is projected to grow faster than the overall \nhistorical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual rate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit \noperations in the sector, to reach a market size of $116 billion by 2010.19 Education is still predominantly \nprovided by public / governmental entities in most countries including the U.S. KUE believes that the \nindustry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the evolution observed \nin the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and telecommunications. \nUS Education Industry: Revenues Generated by For-Profit Companies (1999-2010E) \n$150 - \t10.0% \n$120 \t9.0% \n8.0% \n$60 - \t7.0% \n$30 - \t6.0% \n$0 \t5.0% \n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005E 2006E 2007E 2008E 2009E 2010E \nFor-Profit Spending - _ For-Profit % \n6upueds ieloi io % \nSource: Harris Nesbitt estimates, U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics, Training Magazine and \nEduventures. \n8.3. The U.S. Early Childcare or \"pre-K\" Market \nThe highly fragmented early childcare or \"pre-K\" market includes care based in homes and housed by \ncommunity organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, YMCAs) and center based facilities. Center-\nbased childcare includes preschools (nurseries), workplace centers (located on-site at the company), \nlease-model centers (located in a real estate developer's office building), back-up centers (a variety of on-\nsite and off-site back-up care programs) and family day-care facilities (located in someone's home or \ncenter). Although childcare may evoke thoughts of a babysitting service, education has become an \nincreasingly important element in services to pre-K children. However, the education-focused portion of \nthe childcare market remains relatively small. \nSince the early 1980s, center-based ECE has become the care provider of choice for families. The U.S. \nECE unit generated an estimated $54 billion in total spending in 2005, representing a 10% compound \nannual growth rate since 1982.19 Approximately five million or 60% of 3 to 5-year-olds with working \nmothers are enrolled in ECE centers. 9 The following growth drivers are expected to continue to fuel \ngrowth in the early childcare market: growing importance of ECE, demographics (e.g., more children aged \nfive and younger), increase in families with two working parents, more educated parents, corporations \nrecognizing the benefits of childcare services and tax incentives and other positive legislation. \nThe perception of ECE as a fundamental component of child development has contributed to average \nannual fee increases of roughly 7% amongst center-based facilities, reflecting the stable, relatively \ninelastic nature of the demand for higher quality care.21 The number of children receiving childcare \n1' Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics Database. \n18 Source: US Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics and Training Magazine and Harris Nesbitt research. \n19 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. \n2° Source: \"Early Care and Education: Work Support for Families and Developmental Opportunity for Young Children,\" Urban Institute, September \n2001. \n21 Source: The National Economic Impacts of the Child Care Sector, 2002. \n63 \n\foutside the home grew from 10.6 million in 1999 to an estimated 12 million in 2003, an increase of 3.1% \nannually.22 \n8.3.1 Early Childhood Education's Role in the Economy \nECE enables people to pursue income-generating activities by allowing parents to participate in the \nworkforce and contribute to the economy. A recent study found that every dollar spent on the formal ECE \nsector generates approximately 15 dollars worth of additional earnings by parents. 23 Furthermore, \nevidence suggests that regardless of family income, children who have participated in ECE programs do \nbetter in school than their peers who did not. ECE also reduces social and economic costs by lowering \nschool dropout rates, and leads to decreased levels of criminal activity. These social and demographic \nforces have established ECE as a fundamental component of today's economic 'infrastructure' and a \nsource of economic growth. \nGiven these and other supporting facts, education is an industry that is of growing importance to the \neconomy. This growth is driven by the following factors: \nM Growing public awareness of the importance of early childhood education. ECE has received \nincreased media and government attention as scientific research highlights the importance of \neducation during a child's early developmental years. Children who attend high quality ECE centers \ndemonstrate greater mathematical ability, thinking and attention skills, and fewer behavioral problems \nthroughout their educational lives, when compared with children receiving no or lower quality care. \nThese differences hold true for children from a range of family backgrounds.24 \n• Favorable demographic trends. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the annual \nnumber of live births in the U.S. was approximately 4.1 million in 2003, compared to approximately 3.6 \nmillion in 1980, and the U.S. Census Bureau projects the annual number of live births to increase to \napproximately 4.5 million in 2015.25 The number of children aged five years or under grew from \napproximately 22.5 million in 1990 to approximately 23.4 million in 2002, according to the U.S. Census \nBureau, and is projected to reach 26.8 million in 2015.22 \nNumber of Live Births in the U.S. \n(in thousands) \n4,500 - \n4,250 - \n4,000 - \n3,750 - \n3,500 \n1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007E 2009E 2011E 2013E 2015E \nSource: U.S. Census Bureau. \n• Changing workforce composition. A rising percentage of women participate in the workforce due to an \nincreasingly higher cost of living, a desire for financial independence and an elevated standard of \nliving preference, which necessitates two full-time wage earners for most families. Of the nearly 65 \nmillion jobs created nationally between 1964 and 1997, 40 million were occupied by women. Today, \nmore than 62% of mothers with children under the age of six work full-time compared to 19% in 1960. \n22 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. \n23 Source: The National Economic Impacts of the Child Care Sector, 2002. \n24 Source: The Children of the Cost, Quality, and Outcomes Study Go To School, 1999. \n25 Source: Population Projections Branch, U.S. Census Bureau, \"U.S. Interim Projections by Age, Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin,\" May 2004. \n64 \n\f• Highly educated parents spend more on childcare. The increasing number of college graduates in the \nU.S. and abroad will support continued expenditures on ECE. In 2001, 70% of children with college-\neducated mothers attended childcare programs, while only 38% of children whose mothers had less \nthan a high school degree attended childcare programs. A recent report by the U.S. Department of \nCommerce reveals that families with college degrees spent an average of $92.67 per week (per child) \non childcare in 2000, whereas parents without a high school degree only spent an average of $59.70 \nper week per child.26 \n• Increasing demand for Employer-Sponsored Centers. With increased levels of employment, \ncorporations are witnessing growing demand for ECE services. Companies benefit from offering \nchildcare services to their employees as (i) it often reduces employee absenteeism; (ii) serves as a \nperquisite, which differentiates the employer's compensation package; and (iii) tends to lower turnover \nrates. ECE services contribute to a stable and consistent workforce. \n• Favorable tax incentives. Certain tax incentives are available to parents utilizing childcare programs. \nSpecifically, Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a federal income tax credit (Child and \nDependent Care Credit) ranging from 20% to 35% (increased in 2003) of certain childcare expenses \nfor \"qualifying individuals.\" The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 created a \nFederal Employer Tax Credit for certain childcare expenses beginning in 2002. Employers can \nreceive a credit of 25% of their spending on the construction or rehabilitation of a child care facility or \non contracts with a third party child care facility to provide child care services to employees. \nCorporations also benefit from tax incentives of up to $150,000 per year. \n8.3.2 Industry Characteristics \nThe ECE sector has a number of favorable operating characteristics. First, well-run school operators \nenjoy high returns on capital, predictable revenue streams and strong free cash flows, with students \ngenerally paying in advance of services delivered. Second, industry data shows that tuition rates have \nincreased by approximately 7%, a rate which has exceeded inflation.27 The current outlook suggests no \nchange in this dynamic. Third, government regulation and licensing standards represent notable barriers \nto entry. \nGiven that education is a universally accepted product, management believes that our business model is \nhighly scalable. The basic center model is expected to be essentially repeatable and transferable to new \nmarkets and locations. With labor representing approximately 50% of the total operating cost structure, \ncompanies within this sector tend to benefit from a variable cost structure, which allows them to reduce \ncosts as economic and market conditions change. \nOften the demanding requirements for the selection of school directors and teachers can limit the pool of \nqualified employees for the industry. Low pay also tends to result in high turnover rates of approximately \n50% annually within the industry. \n8.3.3 Competitive Landscape: Early Childhood Education \nThe ECE sector is highly fragmented with the top six providers representing approximately 5% of all \norganized ECE centers. The Company's primary competitors are (i) local nursery schools and child care \ncenters, some of which are non-profit (including religious-affiliated centers), (H) providers of services that \noperate out of their homes and (Hi) other for-profit companies which may operate a number of centers. \nLocal nursery schools and ECE centers generally charge less for their services. Many religious-affiliated \nand other non-profit child care centers have no or lower rental costs than for-profit chains, may receive \ndonations or other funding to cover operating expenses and may utilize volunteers for staffing. \nConsequently, tuition rates at these centers are commonly lower than the Company's rates. \n20 Source: Harris Nesbitt Research, Education and Training, September 2005. \n27 Source: The National Economic Impacts of the Child Care Sector, 2002. \n65 \n\fThere are also several national chains, such as Bright Horizons Family Solutions, La Petite Academy, \nLearning Care Group (ABC Learning) and Nobel Learning Communities, or regional for-profit companies \nwith sizeable numbers of centers and similar economies of scale in curriculum development, marketing \nand site development. \nCompetitive Landscape within Early Childhood Education  \nChurches Other \n1% \n5 % \nFor-Profit Chid \nEducation \n5% \nPublic Sector \nAgencies \n11% \nNon Profit Child \nEducation \n18% \nFamily \nDay Caro \nProvidors \n60% \nSource: Harris Nesbitt Research, Education and Training, September 2005 and The National Childcare Association. \nKLC OpCo successfully competes against these companies, with the following differentiating factors: (i) \nstrong brand equity; (ii) a strong management team; (iii) grass roots level marketing; and (iv) a larger \nnetwork of community centers. KLC also has a number of employer-sponsored centers that gives the \nCompany greater breadth and depth. Finally, KLC is the only large competitor in the sector owned by an \neducation company. Following is a brief description of each of several of the national competitors. \nI ABC Learning (Public, traded on the ASX) \nThe Learning Care Group, ABC Learning's U.S. operating segment, has over 30,000 children enrolled \n(full and part-time) nationwide. Under the Childtime and Tutor Time segments, Learning Care operates \nchild care centers and under the Franchise segment it licenses and provides developmental and \nadministrative support to franchises operating under the Tutor Time brand. As of October 14, 2005, \nChildtime generated LTM sales of $220.7 million across 460 childcare centers in the U.S. (328 of which \nare company owned and 132 of which are franchised locations). On January 11, ABC announced it had \nsuccessfully completed the acquisition of the Learning Care Group, Inc. for $159 million in cash. In \naddition to the 460 centers located in the U.S., ABC operates 707 centers in Australia and New Zealand. \n• Bright Horizons (Public) \nFounded in 1986, Bright Horizons Family Solutions is a leading provider of employer-sponsored child \ncare services. Bright Horizons operates 616 childcare and early education centers for over 600 clients. \nThe company serves more than 66,300 children in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Guam, \nIreland and the United Kingdom. In September of 2005, the company acquired ChildrensFirst Inc. As of \nDecember 31, 2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $625 million and $75 million, \nrespectively. \n• La Petite Academy (Private) \nLa Petite is the third largest operator of for-profit pre-school centers in the U.S., currently serving more \nthan 65,000 children in 649 centers located in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The company also \n66 \n\fowns 68 (included in the 649 centers) Montessori schools which cater to K-12 students. LPA's residential \nAcademies are typically located in residential, middle-income neighborhoods. As of February 28, 2006, \nthe company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $411 million and $33 million, respectively. The \ncompany has been owned by JP Morgan Capital since 1998. \nNobel Learning Communities (Public) \nNobel is a for-profit provider of private pay education and services for education entities for the preschool \nthrough 12th grade market. The company's programs are offered through a network of general education \npreschools, elementary and middle schools, programs for learning challenged students and special \npurpose high schools. Nobel operates 150 schools in 13 states across the U.S. As of December 31, \n2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $166 million and $15 million, respectively. \nAffiliates of the Principals are currently significant shareholders of the company. \n8.3.4 Government's Role in Early Childhood Education \nApproximately 83% of the estimated $54 billion spent on ECE is generated by private and independent \nnon-profit services. The government provides the remaining 17% of services through Head Start and \npublic schools. The government pays for public school and Head Start programs, but also subsidizes \npayments of low-income families to providers of their choice through the Child Care Development Block \nGrant and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which are blended with state dollars. About 25% of \nfor-profit early childhood care revenue comes from these subsidy programs. \nThe government is, at both the federal and state level, actively involved in expanding the availability of \nearly childhood care services. Federal support is delivered at the state level through government-\noperated educational and financial assistance programs. Early childhood care services offered directly by \nstates include training, licensing and regulation for early childhood care providers and resource and \nreferral systems for parents seeking ECE. \nThe increasing importance of education is further demonstrated by the \"No Child Left Behind Act of \n2001,\" signed into law in January 2002. This Act is the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, or ESEA, since ESEA was enacted in 1965. To support this commitment, \nPresident Bush requested a $54.4 billion budget for the Department of Education for fiscal 2007, a 28.9% \nincrease from the 2001 budget of $42.2 billion. \nCertain tax incentives exist for early childhood care programs. Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code \nprovides federal income tax credits ranging from 20% to 35% of certain early childhood care expenses for \nqualified individuals. \n8.4. The U.S. K-12 Education Market \nA fundamental change has occurred in the K-12 sector in recent years, as the desire to improve school \nquality has overtaken demographics as a key growth driver. Companies providing supplemental \neducational services (e.g., KLC) and several school alternatives, such as charter and contract schools \n(e.g., k12), are expected to be instrumental in improving K-12 student performance. \nThe K-12 education market in the U.S. is comprised of over 15,000 school districts including more than \n90,000 K-12 public schools, approximately 3.5 million teachers, and about 54 million students according \nto the National Center for Education Statistics. Total K-12 expenditures, federal, state and local, are \napproximately $500 billion. \nDespite the growth in spending on public education over the last decade, student achievement has shown \nlittle progress. According to the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 32% of eighth-\ngraders performed below the Basic level in mathematics, and only 29% performed at or above the \nProficient level. One-third of American fourth graders are functionally illiterate. KUE believes the \nfollowing factors will present significant market opportunities in the coming years for for-profit K-12 \n67 \n\feducation providers. According to Harris Nesbitt Research, industry experts estimate that the $21.8 \nbillion in revenues generated by for-profit education providers in 2004 will increase to over $29.7 billion in \n2010, 5.3% annual growth. 2° However, these estimates reflect only spending by institutions on \neducational material and do not reflect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational materials, \nwhich represented roughly an additional $20 billion in 2004.28 \nFor-Profit K-12 Education 2004— 2010E \n$30 \n$25 \n$20 \n$15 \n:a \n$21.8 \n_ \n$23.0 \n$24.2 \n$25.5 \nminammsfammis \n$26.8 \nISSINEMEEMSIEN \n$28.2 \n$29.7 \n2004 2005 2006E 2007E \n2008E \n2009E 2010E \n- Professional Development n Print Publishing Supplemental Services Technology Assessment o School Management \nSource: Harris Nesbitt estimates based on Eduventures' The Education Industry: Learning Markets and Opportunities 2004\" \nreport (December 2004). \nStandards and Accountability. Due to the unsatisfactory performance of American students in grades K-\n12, parents and lawmakers are demanding increased standards and accountability in schools. This \ndemand has focused on establishing guidelines for every school and every subgroup of students and \nthen holding the school (and its staff) accountable to students' performance relative to those standards. \nThe Company expects continued focus on academic standards, assessments, and accountability in the \nnear future. Despite this increased attention on standards and accountability, many parents continue to \nremain concerned with the overall effectiveness of the public school system and are increasingly relying \non for-profit education providers. \nCharter Schools and Virtual Academies. There has also been a significant rise in the number of charter \nschools in the U.S. in the past decade. Since Minnesota first enacted legislation in 1991, 40 states and \nthe District of Columbia have passed charter school legislation. Under the typical charter school statute, \nan identified entity, such as the state, a state university or local school district board of education, is \nauthorized to grant a specified number of charters to community groups or non-profit entities to create a \npublic charter school. A growing number of charter boards, in turn, contract with private sector \norganizations to manage the schools. In return for a large measure of autonomy from normal public \nschool regulation, the charter school is accountable for student academic performance. Currently, the \nCompany estimates that there were nearly 2,700 charter schools in operation nationwide, as of January \n2003, with an estimated enrollment of over 685,000 students. Moreover, the federal No Child Left Behind \nAct (\"NCLB\") recognizes charter schools as a viable alternative for students who want to transfer from \nneighborhood schools that are failing. \nTo capitalize upon the increasing number of parents who are willing to educate their children at home and \nstill want to be part of the public system, there are a growing number of virtual schools, where much of \nthe learning is home-based. Most current charter school legislation either explicitly authorizes virtual \npublic schools or does not directly prohibit them. Because virtual schools usually offer a comprehensive \ncurriculum, easy-to-use learning and performance evaluation technology assistance and instructional \nmaterials, the Company believes that a growing number of families will pursue virtual public schools as an \nattractive alternative to traditional schools and a more cost-effective, better organized approach to home \nschooling. The large and scalable platform that exists at k12 is designed to capitalize on this trend as the \nnumber of charter schools has grown on average nearly 13% annually, while charter school enrollment \n28 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. \n68 \n\fhas increased 20% annually, outpacing the less than 1% average K-12 enrollment growth over the same \nperiod 29 \nK-12 Charter Schools and Enrollment (1995 to 2004 \nCharter Schools \n4,000 \t1,000,000 \n3,000 \t- 750,000 \nCl) \n2,000 \t- 500,000 C. \n7 \n1,000 - \t- 250,000 \n0 \n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 \nSchools Students \nNote: Number of students in 1999-2000 school year was estimated. \nSource: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005 and Charter School Leadership Council and Center for \nEducation Reform. \nSupplementary Education Market. For parents who continue to enroll their children in traditional public \nand private schools, there is a growing demand for supplemental education services. According to the \nU.S. Department of Education, 31% of elementary school children, or more than 10 million students \nnationwide, are enrolled in after-school programs. According to Eduventures, the U.S. supplementary \neducation market was estimated to be approximately $8.1 billion in 2003. Additionally, under the No \nChild Left Behind (NCLB) Act, some children in poorly performing schools will be eligible for taxpayer-\nfinanced supplemental educational services. These supplemental educational services can be provided \nby state-approved non-profit or for-profit entities as well as private schools and public schools (including \npublic charter schools). More parents want to spend educational time with their children, but lack access \nto high quality supplemental material that is effective and integrated into a comprehensive plan that is \neasy for a parent to deliver and manage. \nThe virtual school market is a relatively new area within the broader K-12 education market. As a result, \nthere is a growing need for a high quality, trusted, national education offering for this demographic. \nFurthermore, parents are seeking much more robust and comprehensive ongoing assessments than is \ncurrently offered in the public schools, in order to assess their children's progress both on a relative and \nan absolute basis. \n8.5. The International Education Industry \nThe leading authority on the worldwide education industry, the United Nations Educational Scientific and \nCultural Organization (\"UNESCO\"), estimates that average public expenditures on education across the \nworld increased from 4.1% of GNP in 1990 to 4.5% in 2000. In developing countries the increased \ngovernment focus on education is more pronounced as public education expenditures rose to 4.1% in \n2000 from 3.5% in 1990. Based on global gross national income of $48 trillion, KUE estimates that the \nglobal education market opportunity is greater than $2.4 trillion driven by the following factors: \n• Large population of school-aqed children in parts of the world. The opportunity for pre-K-12 education \nis particularly strong in certain countries with high fertility rates. Examples of such opportunities \ninclude India, where mothers give birth to an average of 2.78 children. Increases in the population of \nchildren coupled with an increased awareness of the economic and social benefits of education are \nexpected to lead to significant growth in the global ECE market. \n29 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005 and Charter School Leadership Council and Center for Education Reform. \n69 \n\f• Increased government focus on education. In many countries, per student public spending on \neducation represents a larger portion of per capita GDP than in the U.S. For example, in Australia and \nthe United Kingdom, the government has subsidized a large portion of ECE. Now, countries such as \nSaudi Arabia are developing similar programs. The opportunity for increased government spending on \npre-K-12 education is particularly apparent in growing economies such as China and South Korea as \nthose countries increase their share of world GDP. \n• Potential opportunities in countries with declining populations. In countries that have had low fertility \nrates for several generations, such as Japan and Italy, there often exists a large family structure \nsupporting a single child. KUE believes that this leads to several family members (e.g., both parents \nand grandparents) contributing to a single child's schooling, resulting in higher education expenditures \nper child. In addition, the high cost and limited availability of quality ECE in countries such as Japan \nhas been identified as a contributing factor to declining birth rates in the country. \nThe following paragraphs provide a brief overview of some of the key markets around the world, which \nKUE views as attractive. These include China, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. \n8.5.1 China: Market Overview \nWith a population of 274 million children under a9e 15, and a fertility rate of 1.73, China represents an \nattractive market for early education providers.3u In China, mandatory education starts with primary \nschools, at which most children enroll by age six. Currently, 24 million Chinese children are attending \nkindergarten as a growing middle class and the one-child policy are driving multiple incomes to one child \nand increasing the amount of capital that can be dedicated to education. These socioeconomic factors \nare reflected in the increasing numbers of private kindergartens, which have grown at a rate of 13% over \nthe past eight years.31 \nPublic versus Private Pre-School Education \n13.7% 17.7% \n0.7% \n25.1% 20.1% 19.7% \n180 \n187 183 181 181 176 \nI \njuiLimma_m_ELJ . • \n8.7% 14.7% \nI112 112 116 \nIII III III \n1995 1996 1997 1998___ 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 \nPrivate Schools Total Schools Private Growth \n150 150 142 \nI\nNA I NA JNA I NA \n138 \n181 182 \n172 \n132 \n155160164177 183 187 \n111 I I I I \n128 128 \n1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 \nAll Kindergartens - Private Kindergartens \nNote: Private kindergarten enrollment data unavailable before 1998. \nSource: Ministry of Education, China Education Industry Development Statistics Report, China Education and Research Network. \nSchools tend to be concentrated in larger cities with Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao and Guangzhou \nbeing the largest pre-school markets. Kindergartens are divided into three categories: Bilingual, Foreign \nlanguage and Mandarin. Bilingual kindergartens are typically joint ventures between Chinese and foreign \nentities or owned wholly by Chinese private or public entities. Tuitions for bilingual programs can reach \n$15,000 per year. Foreign language kindergartens are wholly owned foreign schools that recruit only \nforeign students and are typically backed by their embassies. These schools adhere to foreign \neducational standards with Mandarin being taught as a second language. The tuitions of foreign \nlanguage schools range from $10,000 to $22,000 per year. Mandarin kindergartens are typically owned \nby Chinese public entities. \n3° Source: Central Intelligence Agency, World Factbook 2006. \n31 Source: Ministry of Education, China Education Industry Development Statistics Report, China Education and Research Network. \n70 \n\fKindergartens can be set up by the Ministry of Education, private enterprises, universities, communities \nand individuals.

Open to every citizen, the system provides students with free education, books and health \nservices. The government allocates over 25% of the annual State budget to education. \nAccording to the Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabia prizes education because of its critical importance in \ndeveloping the country's human potential. Education is a central aspect of family and community life. \nParents are deeply involved in their children's education, and the close links between home and school \nserve to reinforce the structure of the community and the nation. \nThe government plans to increase the enrollment of 4 to 6-year-olds to 40% by 2014.32 Additionally, by \nroyal decree, education is now required for all 4-year-olds. New labor laws also necessitate that \ncompanies employing 50 or more women provide daycare centers. Despite this new series of laws, there \nstill only exist 1,200 kindergarten schools in Saudi Arabia (42% private and 58% public) to support the \nlegislative pronouncements. The Company anticipates that, additional capacity will be needed to meet \nthese social objectives. These trends, as noted by the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia have led to \nprivate education facilities opening all over the Kingdom. \n8.5.3 United Kingdom: Market Overview \nThe United Kingdom stands out with consistent rises in its investment in education, not just in absolute \nterms, but also relative to national income: Spending on educational institutions increased from 4.3% of \nGDP in 1990 to 5.5% in 1995 and 5.9% in 2002. From 1995 to 2002, spendin9 and enrollment in primary \nand secondary education has also increased by 36% and 21%, respectively.s3 Additionally, the country \ninvests almost twice as much as any other country at the pre-primary level.

KNOWLEDGE UNIVERSE EDUCATION (\"KUE\") \nKUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world. KUE currently operates in the U.S. and \nis the indirect parent company (87.6% ownerships') of KLC and also a major shareholder (owns 17.9% to \n40.0%35 of equity) of k12. In November 2005, KLC divided its business, with substantially all of its real \nestate owned by special purpose subsidiaries (KLC PropCo) and all of its customer contracts and \noperations remaining at KLC and certain other subsidiaries (KLC OpCo). \nThe controlling shareholders of the General Partner are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green \n(collectively the \"Principals\"). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of \nexperience in the education sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. \nSteven Green, a former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as an \ninternational industrialist leading major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing, \nhousing, consumer products, retail and real estate enterprises. The Principals founded KUE and its \naffiliated companies over the past decade based on their vision of a world where competition for human \ncapital is becoming the driving force of economic prosperity. KUE represents the Principals' sole vehicle \nfor equity investment opportunities in the early education through secondary school sector going forward. \nThe Company has an accomplished and internationally recognized leadership team. Led by the \nPrincipals, the Company has a prominent management team and advisory board with significant financial \nresources and substantial experience in the fields of education and real estate management. Additionally, \nthrough its past experiences at KLC, the Company has demonstrated the ability to acquire and integrate \neducation assets. The Company's management consists of people with diverse backgrounds in \noperations, corporate finance, real estate, government relations and education. KUE's role will be to \noversee the portfolio of operating businesses, identify acquisition candidates, hire top level management \nof the operating businesses and help the portfolio companies navigate some of the legislative and \nregulatory matters that exist in K-12 education. These services will be performed for the Company by \nKULG, for which KUE will pay $20.0 million annually to KULG in quarterly installments beginning July 1, \n2006 pursuant to the Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement. See \"Related Party Transactions.\" \nThe General Partner plans to have a Board of Directors (the \"Board\") with representatives from some of \nthe countries KUE plans to expand into, public policy experts and independent directors with \ncomplementary backgrounds. KUE expects to benefit from the breadth and depth of the knowledge, \nexperience and expertise of the Board. At the final closing of this offering, at least two members of the \nBoard will be Independent Directors. After the Initial Listing of the Units and so long as consistent with \ncontractual and licensing obligations, the General Partner will have a majority independent board. \n9.1.

Note Payable to KULG by KU Education, Inc. \nOn January 6, 2005, KU Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of KUE (\"KUE Inc.\") \nexecuted a promissory note in favor of KULG, an entity controlled by the Principals, in the amount of \n$200.0 million, the proceeds of which were used in connection with the acquisition of KinderCare by \nKLC. This note has a seven year maturity and accrues interest at the \"reference rate\" set by Bank of \nAmerica plus 1.25% per annum. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without any premium or \npenalty. As of April 1, 2006, KUE Inc. owes approximately $183.9 million under the note. \n9.3. Term Loan Facility \nOn March 29, 2006, Knowledge Universe Education LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"KUE \nLLC\"), entered into a six-month $150 million term loan facility with an affiliate of Credit Suisse, one of the \nAgents. The proceeds of the $150 million term loan were used to repay existing debt of KUE LLC to \nentities controlled by Michael Milken. \nThe term loan facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by KUE LLC's direct and indirect parents and \nthe parent guaranty is several. Upon contribution of assets to KUE by KUE LLC, KUE will become a co-\nborrower. It is expected that this Term Loan Facility will be repaid with the proceeds of this offering. \nThe term loan bears interest at either the reserve adjusted LIBOR rate plus 0.125% or the base rate \n(generally the applicable prime lending rate, as announced from time to time), at KUE's option and is \nsecured by cash collateral. KUE is permitted to voluntarily prepay the term loan, in whole or in part, \nwithout premium or penalty, upon the giving of proper notice. \n74 \n\f10. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF KLC's \nPRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nIn January 2005, KLC acquired KinderCare and incurred $540 million of term debt (the \"Acquisition Term \nDebt\") and $250 million of subordinated bridge debt to finance the acquisition. At the time of the \nKinderCare acquisition, KinderCare had approximately $300 million of nonrecourse mortgage debt \noutstanding (the \"KinderCare CMBS Debt\"). KLC refinanced the bridge debt in February 2005 with $260 \nmillion of 7-3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the \"Notes\"). In November 2005, KLC completed \na transaction (the \"Real Estate Transaction\") in which KLC divided its business, with substantially all of its \nreal estate owned by special purpose subsidiaries (collectively, KLC PropCo) and all of its customer \ncontracts and operations remaining at KLC and certain other subsidiaries (collectively, KLC OpCo). \nManagement believes that this division represents the best way to analyze the business going forward. \nIn connection with the Real Estate Transaction, KLC PropCo entities incurred $650 million of mortgage \ndebt, $50 million of senior mezzanine debt and $150 million of junior mezzanine debt, which \nindebtedness is nonrecourse to KLC OpCo, the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay the \nAcquisition Term Debt and the KinderCare CMBS Debt, and KLC PropCo leased its owned centers back \nto KLC OpCo. See \"KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \nOperations for the Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003\" in Appendix B, \"KLC: Management's \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended \nApril 1, 2006\" in Appendix C, \"KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and \nResults of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended July 1, 2006\" in Appendix D and Notes 11 and 21 to \nKLC's Financial Statements in Appendix E. \nThe discussion below presents the pro forma results of consolidated KLC (KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo) \nas if the KinderCare acquisition and the Real Estate Transaction occurred on January 1, 2004. The pro \nforma results are not adjusted for the costs of operating KLC and KinderCare in parallel for a significant \nportion of 2005, or for restructuring costs incurred in combining the two businesses. These and other \nitems are reflected as adjustments to EBITDA in our presentation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. \nOur pro forma results for KLC were not prepared in conformity with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the \nSEC (which would not, among other limitations, permit a 2004 pro forma presentation after completion of \nour 2005 financial statements). In addition, by presenting a pro forma comparison, this discussion and \nanalysis does not include a comparison of KLC's historical GAAP consolidated operating results or \nsegment information that would be required by Item 3-03 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. The presentation \nof non-GAAP information herein does not purport to comply with Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or \nRegulation G of the SEC. For further information see \"KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003\" in \nAppendix B, \"KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \nOperations for the Quarterly Period Ended April 1, 2006\" in Appendix C, \"KLC: Management's Discussion \nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended July 1, \n2006\" in Appendix D and the KLC and KinderCare GAAP financial statements in Appendix E. \nThe pro forma presentation is not shown with adjustments to historical financial statements. Instead, it is \nbased on a \"ground up\" combination of corporate level expenditures (overhead and capital expenditures) \nand internal financial statements derived from a center-by-center build up of KLC's results. The primary \nreasons for the presentation based on internal reports instead of KLC and KinderCare financial \nstatements are the different fiscal year ends and expense classifications between KLC and KinderCare. \nThe \"ground up\" analysis presented is consistent with management's view of the business. \nKey Operating Variables \nNet Revenue Trends and Drivers \n75 \n\fThe vast majority of KLC's net revenues are derived from center operations. The trends and drivers \ndiscussed below relate to such center operations. \nKLC derives its net revenues primarily from the tuition it charges for attendance by children at its centers. \nKLC's tuition rates and net revenues can be significantly impacted by the enrollment characteristics at its \ncenters. Key factors include (1) geographic location, because KLC can command higher tuition rates in \ncertain geographic areas; (2) the age mix of children enrolled, because tuition rates depend on the age of \nthe child and are generally higher for younger children; (3) the mix between full- and part-time attendance, \nbecause KLC charges comparatively higher rates for part-time enrollment and (4) the level of participation \nin government subsidy and discount programs. \nKLC calculates its average weekly tuition rate as the actual tuition charged at centers that are open at the \ncalculation date, net of discounts, for a specified time period, divided by average \"full-time equivalents,\" or \n\"FTEs\" for the related time period. KLC's FTEs are calculated by dividing net revenue by the center's \nundiscounted average pre-school tuition rate. FTEs do not necessarily reflect the actual number of full-\nand part-time children enrolled. \nTuition rates at KLC's centers are typically adjusted once per year to coincide with the back-to-school \nperiod. KLC typically collects tuition on a weekly basis in advance, the majority of which is paid by \nindividual families. KLC provides discounts to government agencies, employees, families with multiple \nenrollments, referral sources and organizations KLC partners with for its employer-sponsored centers. In \nits employer-sponsored centers, tuition may be partly subsidized by such employers. \nApproximately 20% of KLC's net revenues are derived from tuition paid at varying levels of subsidy by \ngovernment agencies. KLC's revenues are therefore affected by changes in the levels of government \nsupport for education, which are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions and resulting budget \npressure at federal, state and local governments. \nKLC reports comparable center revenue trends based on the centers (other than the employer-sponsored \ncenters operated for a management fee) that were open in both periods. Comparable center net revenues \ndo not include revenues generated from centers that have been closed or sold. \nUtilization is a measure of the utilization of center capacity. KLC calculates utilization as the total actual \nchild care revenues earned at centers that are open at the calculation date divided by the total potential \nchild care revenue (based upon the center's undiscounted pre-school tuition rate and the center's total \nlicensed capacity) during the related time period. \nIn addition to tuition charges, KLC records revenues from fees and other income in a majority of its \ncenters. KLC charges a reservation fee, typically at half of the normal tuition charge, for any full week that \nan enrolled child is absent from its centers. KLC also collects registration fees and fees to cover \neducational supplies at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter. KLC offers tutorial programs on a \nsupplemental fee basis in the majority of our centers in the areas of literacy and reading, foreign \nlanguage, mathematics and music. KLC also offers field trips, predominantly during the summer months, \nfor an additional charge. KLC's centers earn other miscellaneous revenue from various sources, including \nmanagement fees related to certain employer-sponsored centers. In addition to its child care operations, \nKLC's subsidiary, KC Distance Learning, sells high school level courses via online and correspondence \nformats and provides related instructional services directly to private students, as well as to cyber and \ntraditional schools and school districts. \nCost of Revenue — Trends and Drivers \nKLC's costs of revenue include the direct costs related to the operations of its centers. Labor related costs \nare the largest component of costs of revenue. KLC's time management and scheduling systems, which \nenable us to adjust staffing levels for peak and reduced attendance periods, allow KLC to manage its \nlabor productivity without adversely impacting the quality of services within its centers. \n76 \n\fOther costs recorded at the center level include rent, marketing, maintenance, utilities, transportation, \nclassroom and office supplies, insurance and food. KLC's management believes its large, combined \nnationwide center base gives it the ability to leverage the costs of programs and services, such as \ncurriculum development, training programs and other management processes. \nDuring fiscal year 2005, KLC experienced a reduction in projected claims costs for its self-insurance \nprograms. However, management anticipates that premium and claims costs will continue to reflect \nmarket forces, which are beyond KLC's control. \nThe Real Estate Transaction did not affect consolidated rent expense, but resulted in an increase of \napproximately $96.0 million in annual rent expense of KLC OpCo, which is leasing centers from KLC \nPropCo which now has title to substantially all of KLC's owned real property. \nOther Operating Expenses \nKLC's other operating expenses include the costs associated with the field management and corporate \noversight and support of its centers and restructuring related expenses. Labor related costs are the \nlargest component of KLC's general and administrative expenses. \nSeasonality \nNew enrollments are generally highest during the traditional fall \"back to school\" period and after the \ncalendar year-end holidays. KLC attempts to focus its marketing efforts to support these periods of high \nreenrollments. Enrollment generally decreases somewhat during the summer months and the calendar \nyear-end holidays. \nResults Discussion \nRevenue increased to $1.48 billion in 2005, which represents an increase of $35.6 million over 2004. \nGross margin was $340.7 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $11.1 \nmillion, or 3.4%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA during the 52 weeks ended \nDecember 31, 2005, was $238.0 million which was $6.6 million, or 2.9%, above the same period in 2004. \n77 \n\fKLC Consolidated \n2004PF \t2005PF \nRevenue \t$1,442.2 \t$1,477.7 \nRevenue Growth \t2.5% \nPayroll and other \t$725.0 \t$734.9 \nRent \t113.2 \t121.1 \nOther Operating Expenses \t274.4 \t281.0 \nGross Profit \t$329.6 \t$340.7 \nAdjusted EBITDA \t$231.4 \t$238.0 \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin \t16.0% \t16.1% \nAdjusted EBITDAR \t$344.5 \t$359.1 \nAdjusted EBITDAR Margin \t23.9% \t24.3% \nOther Financial and Operating Data \nDepreciation and Amortization \t$97.1 \t$89.3 \nInterest Expense \t89.9 \t89.9 \nCapital Expenditures \t70.6 \t83.1 \n# of Centers (at year end) \t2,021 \t1,934 \nAverage Weekly Tuition \u000b(combined actual) \t$156.61 \t$167.35 \nUtilization \t61.6% \t61.2% \nRevenue. During the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, revenue increased $35.6 million, or 2.5%, \nover the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to tuition rate increases, which took effect \nin January 2005 and September 2005, offset by the impact of center closures and a slight decline in \nUtilization. However, during the third quarter of 2005 Utilization levels increased versus the same period \nin 2004, from 59.3% to 60.3%. This positive Utilization trend was repeated in the fourth quarter of 2005 \nas levels rose to 59.2% versus 58.9% in the comparable period of 2004. Management believes these \nimprovements reflect stronger economic conditions, strong back-to-school enrollments, marketing efforts \nand other management initiatives and programs. ECE revenue increased $24.9 million, or 1.8%, in the \n52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period of 2004.

Salaries, wages and benefits were $734.9 million, or 49.7% as a \npercentage of sales, during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $725.0 million or \n50.3%, for the same period in 2004. \n• Rent Rent increased by $8.0 million to $121.1 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, \n2005, compared to the same period in 2004. The increase in rent was largely due to a center sale-\nleaseback program conducted by KinderCare during 2004, prior to its acquisition by KLC. Pro forma \nrent does not include $96.3 million of intercompany rent payable by KLC OpCo to KLC PropCo as a \nresult of the Real Estate Transaction. \n• Other costs. Other costs include costs directly associated with the centers such as business \ninsurance, food, marketing, maintenance, utilities, transportation and classroom and office supplies. \nOther costs were $281.0 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $274.4 \nmillion in the same period last year.

General and administrative expenses, which include costs \nassociated with the field and corporate oversight and support of KLC's centers, were $126.0 million during \nthe 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $126.4 million for the same period in 2004. \nGeneral and administrative expenses included the substantial majority of estimated temporary parallel \norganization costs of $28.1 million and $23.3 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively, as discussed below. \nAdiusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $238.0 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 \ncompared to $231.4 million in 2004. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of slightly \nhigher revenue and gross margin improvements enhanced by lower general and administrative costs \nbefore non-cash SAR accruals, net of restructuring charges and parallel organization costs. The table \nsummarizes KLC's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA as defined in KLC's existing revolving credit \nagreement.

Restructuring charges during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, were \n$29.4 million. Included in the $29.4 million of non-recurring integration costs were $11.0 million of \nseverance costs that resulted primarily from the closure of KLC's former corporate offices at Golden, CO. \nAdditional restructuring costs in 2005 were the result of consulting, temporary contract-based labor and \nother charges. Restructuring charges in 2004 were $5.1 million and were related to KLC's acquisition of \nAER in May 2003. \nParallel Organization Costs. For much of 2005 KLC was burdened with the central operations and \ninfrastructure of both KinderCare and KLC. KLC has defined parallel organization costs as the cost of \nmaintaining these duplicative corporate functions during the overhead rationalization associated with the \nKinderCare acquisition. KLC believes that approximately 70% of parallel organization costs are related to \nsalaries. Remaining parallel organization costs are related to upkeep, maintenance and utilities at \ncorporate facilities. During the first month of 2006 parallel organization costs had been reduced to \n$174,042 (annualized run-rate of $2.1 million) compared to an estimated $23.3 million in 2005. \nParallel organization costs for the 2004 fiscal year are estimated based on an annualized run-rate based \non the costs incurred during the first month following the KinderCare acquisition. During that month \n(January 2005), KLC incurred approximately $2.3 million of parallel organization costs ($28.1 million on \nan annualized run-rate basis). \nInterest. Interest expense in 2004 and 2005 is almost identical because both years are pro forma for the \nfinancings associated with the Real Estate Transaction, which refinanced the indebtedness incurred to \nfinance the KinderCare acquisition. In 2005 pro forma interest expense of $89.9 million includes $5.1 \nmillion of non-cash interest expense. Actual interest expense during the 2005 fiscal year was $80.7 \nmillion which did not include $32.2 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. \n80 \n\fCapital Expenditures. The following table shows the breakdown in KLC's projected capital expenditures: \nKLC Consolidated \n2004PF \t2005PF \nMaintenance \t$34.4 \t$36.6 \nNew Centers \t26.4 \t32.4 \nIT Spending and Other Capex \t9.8 \t14.0 \nTotal Capital Expenditures \t$70.6 \t$83.1 \nIn 2004 and 2005, KLC spent $34.4 million and $36.6 million, respectively on maintenance capital \nexpenditures, which includes refurbishment of its existing centers and equipment and supplies \nreplacement costs. In addition, KLC spent $9.8 million in 2004 on corporate infrastructure improvements, \nprimarily IT spending compared to $14.0 million in 2005. The remainder of KLC's capital expenditures \nwas used to expand KLC's center base through both purchases of furniture, fixtures and equipment and \nconstruction of new owned centers. \n81 \n\f11. THE OPERATING COMPANY (\"KLC OPCO\") \nKLC's mission is to provide a quality education to children from birth to college. KLC was formed from the \ncombination of KLC and AER which occurred in May 2003 and the subsequent acquisition of KinderCare \nin January of 2005. Based in Portland, Oregon, KLC consists of (i) KLC OpCo, a collection of operating \ncompanies and (ii) KLC PropCo, a collection of special purpose subsidiaries owning substantially all of \nKLC's real estate. \n11.1. KLC OpCo \nKLC OpCo is the largest for-profit provider of ECE and care services in the U.S., the second largest \nprovider of employer-sponsored ECE to the corporate segment in the U.S. and the largest for-profit \nprovider of before and after school programs in the U.S. Through one of its subsidiaries, KLC OpCo also \noperates accredited high school distance learning programs that have served over 200,000 students \nsince 1975. On a pro forma basis for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo generated \nrevenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,477.7 million and $149.9 million, respectively. \nKLC OpCo Business Units \nKLC OpCo \nEarly Childhood Education (\"ECE\") \n(Community (Employer \nCenters) Sponsored Centers) \n1,812 centers 122 centers \n90% of Pro Forma 6% of Pro Forma \nRevenue Revenue \nSchool Partnerships \n(Before and after school care) \n573 sites \n3% of Pro Forma Revenue \nDistance Learning \n(Online Education) \n1% of Pro Forma Revenue \n11.2. Early Childhood Education Unit (96% of Pro Forma FYE December 31, 2005 \nRevenue) \nAs of FYE December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo provided ECE services through its 1,812 company-operated \ncommunity centers (90% of pro forma revenue) and 122 employer-sponsored centers (6% of pro forma \nrevenue). In total the ECE Unit operated 1,934 centers in 39 states and Washington D.C., offering ECE \nprograms primarily for children aged six weeks to five years. The programs are marketed primarily under \nthe KinderCare, Children's World, Children's Discovery Centers, Knowledge Beginnings and Mulberry \nChild Care & Preschool brand names. \nKLC OpCo's centers typically contain classrooms, recreational areas, kitchens and bathroom facilities. \nThe centers usually accommodate the grouping of children according to age. The centers have outdoor \nplaygrounds, often with separate areas designed for infants and toddlers, with the exception of some \ndowntown urban centers that may utilize nearby parks. Each center is equipped with a variety of audio \nand visual aids, educational supplies, games, toys and indoor and outdoor play equipment. In addition, \nmost of the centers are equipped with personal computers with programs specifically designed for both \npre-school and school-age children. The typical center can serve between 120-140 students, although \nactual enrollments can be higher as some children are enrolled on a part-time basis. Children are usually \nenrolled on a weekly basis for either full-day or half-day sessions. Most centers provide enrolled children \nwith meals and two snacks. \n82 \n\fKLC OpCo provides a wide range of quality programs that are continuously updated to reflect current \nthinking and to meet the needs of individual children. Programs have been developed in conjunction with \nnationally recognized experts in ECE and various curricula reflect the latest research in brain \ndevelopment. Programs stimulate the social, emotional, intellectual and physical needs of children and \neach program is age appropriate. \nKLC OpCo's ECE facilities are generally open throughout the year, usually five days a week, from 6:30 \na.m. to 6:30 p.m. New enrollments are most often highest in September and January, with the largest \ndecrease in enrollment during holiday periods and summer months. Many centers offer summer day \ncamp programs for children up to the age of 12. Additionally, many centers offer \"back-up\" care, which is \noffered in the event that the parent's primary child care arrangement is unavailable (e.g., when an in-\nhome provider goes on vacation). The company will provide short-term child care until the parent's child \ncare resumes. \nCommunity Centers \nThe 1,812 community centers are located in diverse demographic locations. Newly built centers tend to \nbe located in the targeted demographic market of newer upper-middle class to upper income suburban \nareas with high concentrations of dual income families. In a community center, the current weekly tuition \nrates for full-day service range from $90 to $400 per child, depending upon the center location and the \nage of the child. KLC OpCo also offers tutorial programs in areas such as literacy, reading, foreign \nlanguages and mathematics in many of its centers for a supplemental fee and is exploring offering \nadditional supplemental fee programs. Tuition is generally paid in advance on a weekly basis and, to a \nlesser extent, on a monthly basis. The company typically sets tuition for half-day programs at a 20% to \n40% premium compared with an equal number of hours for a full-day program. Approximately 20% of \ntuition is paid under state and federal subsidy programs. \nEmployer-Sponsored Centers \nAs of FYE December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo operated 122 corporate or employer-sponsored centers. \nThese centers are typically free-standing, and are located at or near the premises or campus of the \nemployer-sponsor. These sites are different from community centers in that they usually have more \nsquare footage per child and larger staff areas. Generally, the corporate sponsor provides the \nconstructed building. KLC OpCo currently has relationships with a diverse group of employers, including \nhospitals, health care facilities, government agencies, and private sector companies. Its corporate \nrelationships include, but are not limited to, the following: AOL Time Warner, TRW, Lockheed Martin, the \nWorld Bank Group, Fox, Maytag, Northrop, TJ Maxx, the National Security Agency, the Mayo Clinic and \nStanford University. \nEmployer-sponsored centers are operated either on a fixed-fee basis (31 centers) or on a profit-and-loss \nbasis (91 centers). Under the former, KLC OpCo receives a fixed fee per month, typically irrespective of \noccupancy. In these contracts, the Company collects tuition on behalf of the employer sponsor. Under a \nprofit-and-loss contract, KLC OpCo collects tuition for its own account, generally with no guaranteed fees \nfrom the employer. In some cases, its operations are subsidized by the employer, typically in the form of \ntuition subsidies, free or reduced rent, the provision of certain services such as maintenance, landscaping \nand janitorial services or enrollment guarantees. This enables the company to utilize the subsidies for \nimproved staff quality and teacher / child ratios. \nContract terms typically average between one and five years. Normally the management centers are \nreserved for children of the corporations' employees. Some contracts provide for accepting non-\nemployee children, for which the company can often charge a higher tuition. \n83 \n\f11.3. School Partnerships Unit (3% of Pro Forma EYE December 31, 2005 Revenue) \nThrough the School Partnerships Unit, KLC OpCo provides customized before and after school \neducational enrichment and recreational programs for school age and preschool children in partnership \nwith elementary schools. KLC OpCo provides these partnership services primarily through 573 sites in 20 \nstates. Average tuition ranges from $35—$75 per week, payable in advance. Parents account for 94% of \ntotal tuition received, while state and grant subsidies account for the remaining 6%. \nThese before and after school programs are typically conducted in collaboration with public schools and \nlocated on-site at public school campuses. The success of the programs has led to the development of \nsummer camps, remedial programs, and drop-in care. Programs are operated under the Champions \nname. Because each program is relatively small (approximately 40 children per program), operating \ncosts associated with running each program are minimal. Little or no capital investment is required and \nthe contracting school typically provides on-site space for the program. Contract tenures range from one \nyear to evergreen. They often stipulate that KLC pays minimum fees to the elementary schools for use of \nfacilities. \nKLC OpCo's November 2004 acquisition of EdSolutions, Inc. (\"ESI\") provided it entry into the \nSupplemental Education Services (\"SES\") tutoring business. The SES business is part of the federal No \nChild Left Behind Act's effort to improve the performance of students at failing schools. KLC OpCo \noperates 72 SES sites. ESI is approved to provide SES in 19 states and our plans call for ESI to serve as \na platform for future growth for KLC. \n11.4. Distance Learning (1% of Pro Forma FYE December 31, 2005 Revenue) \nThrough its wholly owned subsidiary, KCDL, KLC OpCo also operates accredited high school distance \nlearning programs that have served over 200,000 students since 1975. Based in Portland, Oregon, \nKCDL operates Keystone National High School and iQ Academies. Keystone National High School is \none of the largest and most experienced accredited high school distance learning programs in the country. \nKeystone is a private, diploma granting school with parents or schools paying for individual courses \nand/or complete curriculum. Keystone served over 14,000 students in 2005 and offers more than 60 \ndistance learning courses. iQ Academies develops and manages online charter schools. It currently \noperates one school in Wisconsin, is working on the approval process for another charter in California, \nand has plans to begin several more charters in the next 12 months. iQ Academies provides support \nrequired to launch and operate an online high school including curriculum, instruction, technology, \nmarketing and support. Though only 1% of KLC OpCo's pro forma revenues, KCDL is highly profitable \nand accounts for almost 2% of KLC OpCo's pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. \n11.5. Business Strategy \nKLC OpCo's strategy is to drive revenue growth and enhance profitability through a combination of the \nfollowing initiatives: \n• Expansion of existing business lines. Management believes that the opportunity exists to significantly \nexpand the scope of its existing business lines: \n— Community centers. KLC OpCo has substantial experience in selecting and opening new \ncommunity centers. Over the next six years KLC OpCo plans to open 195 new centers which are \nexpected to generate approximately $200 million of gross revenue. \nEmployer-sponsored centers. KLC OpCo expects to continue the expansion of its employer-\nsponsored centers. Over the next six years KLC OpCo plans to open 124 new centers with gross \nrevenue of approximately $120 million. \n54 \n\f• Rationalize centers to improve overall strategy and quality of network Management closely monitors \nunderperforming centers and looks to rationalization opportunities which generally lead to improved \nUtilization and higher EBITDA generation. \n— As part of its rationalization, KLC OpCo has identified 50 centers which it intends to close and will \ncontinue to evaluate underperforming centers. As a result, over the next six years KLC OpCo \nexpects to close approximately 250 centers with a decrease in revenues of approximately $120 \nmillion. While the closure of underperforming centers decreases KLC OpCo's revenue, \nrationalization is expected to increase both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins. \n• Strategic acquisitions. The childcare market remains highly fragmented with for-profit chains \ncomprising only 5% of the entire market. There are over 386,000 family-owned and operated centers, \nwith each providing services to fewer than 13 children. KLC OpCo believes there are many \nopportunities to consolidate some of the family-run centers as well as some of the larger regional \nproviders. \n• Offer new products and services. KLC OpCo estimates that it services more than 200,000 families in \na given year. KLC OpCo's scope of operations makes it ideally positioned to market other products \nand services through its learning centers. KLC OpCo has already sold several additional lines of \neducational products and services at test locations including supplemental phonics, math, Spanish \nand music courses. KLC OpCo believes that product and service lines can be expanded to include \nadditional educational and non-educational offerings such as medical insurance and student financing \nprograms. \n• Initiation of the Spirit of Service Program. The fundamental assumption of the Spirit of Service \nprogram is that sales are not separate from service—both are driven by relationships. To that end, the \nSpirit of Service program was designed to promote revenue growth by building a sales-oriented culture \nwhile increasing customer / parent engagement. Currently, KLC OpCo's management team is working \nwith consultants from Cypress Consulting and the Gallup Organization to: \n— Understand and evaluate current practices and expectations regarding sales and service; \n— Provide reliable data to help grow enrollments through a better understanding of families who have \ndisenrolled and KLC OpCo's current customers; \n— Develop the sales and coaching skill necessary to support requisite practices and behaviors; and \n____ Institutionalize practices, systems and incentive plans to ensure a sustainable focus and culture \nbuilt around sales and customer service. \n11.6. Sales and Marketing \nEarly Childhood Care and Education \nCommunity Centers. KLC OpCo's target market is middle-class to affluent ($70,000+ household income), \nhighly educated parents working or residing near the center. Target parents are white-collar workers and \nare usually dual-income families. KLC looks for sites where it believes the market for its services will \nsupport tuition rates higher than current average rates. \nManagement believes KLC OpCo distinguishes its services by developing and introducing high quality \ncurricula and programs that incorporate both learning and enjoyable activities held in a safe and \nchild-friendly environment. KLC OpCo markets its services through online channels (including strategic \nclick through advertisement placements), as well as traditional methods, such as display advertisements, \nlistings in the yellow pages, newspaper advertisements, distribution of flyers at schools and community \nfunctions, and center open house events. KLC OpCo spends a large portion of its advertising budget \nduring the summer months in anticipation of the fall enrollment period, with continued advertising \nthroughout the year. The primary source of new enrollments is recommendations from customers in the \ncommunities in which KLC OpCo operates. Center directors are also involved in the marketing process \n85 \n\fby encouraging parental involvement in the centers through monthly newsletters and reports, \nparent-teacher conferences and parental visits to, and inspections of, the centers. \nAlthough most of the marketing efforts are performed at the field level, corporate headquarters assists \ncenters in developing marketing programs, designing campaigns, preparing marketing brochures, \nstrengthening the brand name, identifying strategic partners, and providing advice on ways to advertise \nand market the programs at the local level. In addition, KLC OpCo is actively involved in teaching the \nstaff and directors business enhancing skills, such as cost management, local marketing and customer \nrelations. \nEmployer-Sponsored Centers. Services that KLC OpCo provides to employers include onsite and near-\nsite center operation, backup care, discount programs, holiday care and consulting services. KLC OpCo \nhas dedicated sales personnel focused on expanding its presence in this market. It also markets its \nservices through relationships with consultants, attendance and presentations with clients at trade shows, \nnetworking at conferences and through industry alliances and publications. KLC OpCo responds to \nrequests for proposals, referrals from current clients and prospects to targeted mid-market centers for \ntransition opportunities through mailings and networking. It also targets Fortune 1000 companies for its \ndiscount and nationwide backup care services which serve large distributed workforces. \nMarketing to employers or corporate sponsors largely takes place at the corporate level. KLC OpCo \nmarkets to parents through its employer sponsors and occasionally through contracted resource and \nreferral agencies. KLC OpCo is finding that the preferred method is through electronic brochures and \nmessages as well as dedicated websites for onsite centers and services. KLC OpCo provides hardcopy \nmaterials and promotional giveaways primarily through employer-sponsored benefit fairs and events on \nclient campuses. The centers engage parents and potential parents through brown bag lunch seminars, \nopen houses, and visibility tables in client cafeterias and common areas. \nSchool Partnerships \nChampions Programs. KLC OpCo positions its Champions school age, preschool and summer programs \nas exciting combinations of learning and fun. It relies primarily on a regional, direct sales force in \neffecting a two tiered sales and marketing approach. The first tier consists of selling the Champions \nservice at the appropriate administrative level in the school. This selling generally occurs at the \nsuperintendent or principal level. Selling to administrators is necessary since the majority of Champions' \nprograms rely solely on the use of existing school infrastructure. The- sales and marketing effort in this \ntier involves participation in trade shows, featured articles in trade journals, trade magazine advertising \nand news releases. KLC OpCo believes that these efforts have been successful in heightening brand \nawareness, and as such, has enabled its sales force to gain access to entire districts versus individual \nschools. \nOnce a Champions program receives the endorsement of the appropriate decision-maker, the second tier \nof the sales and marketing effort begins, which targets the parents of children attending the sponsor \nschool and, in some cases, nearby schools. Marketing is conducted primarily through flyers, open \nhouses and school newsletters. \nSupplemental Education Services. The sales and marketing process for SES tutoring involves several \nsteps. First, KLC OpCo must seek approval to provide services in a state through a request-for-proposal \nprocess. This process entails detailed descriptions of the curriculum provided and how it correlates with \nstate standards, testing and accountability, the operational model to be provided and company \nbackground information. Once approval is obtained at the state level, KLC OpCo contacts districts it is \ninterested in serving, and requests that it be added to the list of approved providers. At the same time \nthat it makes the initial contact with districts, it also contacts local schools, often through such schools' \nSES coordinator, and subsequently with the parents at each school. \nOnce KLC OpCo has been approved by the state, district and the schools, it competes with multiple SES \nproviders selling to individual parents, who are the ultimate decision makers in terms of selecting a \n86 \n\fprovider. Many providers are currently offering incentives to children and families to enroll with them and \nsome are offering incentives to schools as well. The key challenge in marketing the SES programs to \nfamilies is offering something that is appropriate and that will add educational value for families while \nenticing the children to participate. KLC OpCo believes there is a much larger number of children eligible \nfor services than the number that attend programs and therefore an opportunity exists to improve \nmarketing and outreach to families. \nIdentifying prospects involves targeting urban areas where there is a cluster of failing schools. Failing \nschools are schools that fail to meet established NCLB requirements for three years in a row. After the \nsecond year of failure the schools have to offer several services in order to prevent being named a failing \nschool. This enables KLC OpCo to project the approximate number of schools that will be considered \nfailing in the next school year and help identify states to pursue and markets that warrant further attention. \nKLC OpCo is currently authorized to provide SES in 19 states and has already begun providing SES in \nfive of them. KLC OpCo believes the SES business provides an opportunity for growth. \nOn August 29, 2006, KLC acquired 100% of the membership interests in Education Station, LLC \n(\"Education Station\") from Catapult Learning LLC (\"Catapult\"), a subsidiary of Educate, Inc. (together with \nCatapult, \"Educate\") Education Station is a private provider of supplemental educational services under \nthe NCLB and other educational instruction and after school services. The purchase agreement provides \nfor an aggregate purchase price of $6.0 million with $3.0 million paid into escrow at closing, and $1.0 \nmillion payable on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date. The amount in escrow is \npayable to Educate on three specific dates during the period beginning ninety days from the closing date \nand ending on July 31, 2007 upon the renewal by Education Station of certain contracts which were in \nplace applicable to the 2005-2006 school year. Also on August 29, 2006, KLC and Educate entered into \na technology license agreement where Educate granted a license to KLC of certain proprietary software \nused in providing real-time online NCLB services. The term of the license agreement is four years and \nprovides for a license fee of $10 million payable in three installments of $3.0 million within 30 days \nfollowing each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date and a final installment of $1 million within \n30 days following the fourth anniversary. KLC believes that the acquisition of Education Station makes it \nthe largest for-profit provider of supplemental education services under the NCLB in the U.S. \nDistance Learning \nKLC OpCo markets its distance learning products to two distinct customer groups: the home school \nmarket and schools. Purchases made into the home school market are driven by web-based marketing \nefforts and trade associations along with a direct mail campaign. Purchases made by schools are \nmarketed to counselors and administrators through direct mail and telemarketing efforts. \n11.7. Curriculum \nKLC OpCo believes that it can increase enrollment in its centers by continuing to develop and introduce \nhigh quality curricula and programs that provide parents with meaningful reasons to choose the centers \nfor their children over other alternatives. It has designed research-based, proprietary curricula for age-\nspecific educational and recreational programs to develop a child's social, intellectual and physical skills \nand distributed curriculum manuals for each age group to its centers. These programs are used as a \nframework, within which individual teachers have flexibility to create daily instruction opportunities that are \ntailored to the needs of each class. \nThe curriculum covered by the \"Early Foundations\" program is carefully designed to support school \nreadiness. Activities are developed and implemented based on an expansive, research-based framework \nof educational objectives. These objectives mirror well documented early learning standards. Frequent \nassessment insures both program quality and desirable child outcomes. \n57 \n\fThe Early Foundations program focuses on providing individual learning opportunities that are flexible \nand appropriate to each child's development level. KLC OpCo believes that the Early Foundations \nprogram distinguishes the Company from other child care providers. \n11.8. Management Team and Board of Directors \nKLC OpCo is led by a highly experienced management team comprised of experts in the field of \neducation, as well as business professionals. This combination of talent is expected to drive continued \nsuccess of KLC OpCo. These individuals are also supported by a seasoned executive and middle \nmanagement team with average Company tenure of ten years. The following table sets forth KLC OpCo's \nmanagement team and the board of directors of its parent company, KSI. Detailed biographies can be \nfound in Appendix A. \nManagement of KLC \nName \nElanna Yalow \nMark Moreland \nToni Jaffe \nEva Kripalani \nMarcy Suntken \nDan Frechtling \nSharon Bergen \nStephen Brown \nName \nLes Biller \nPosition \nDirector, President and Chief Operating Officer \nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer \nSenior Vice President, Human Resources \nSenior Vice President, General Counsel and \nCorporate Secretary \nSenior Vice President, School Partnerships \nSenior Vice President, Marketing and Business Development \nSenior Vice President, Education and Training \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, KCDL \nNon-Employee Directors of Knowledge Schools Inc.

Employees \nAs of December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo employed approximately 40,000 non-unionized personnel. Of the \ntotal amount, 39,639 are employed at the field level (including teachers and center staff, center directors, \nfacilities and field and regional staff) and 592 are employed at the corporate level. Given the seasonality \nof the child care business and the regulated teacher-student ratio that varies by age with each state, \napproximately 16.5% of the total field personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Teachers and \nteaching assistants, which account for 93% of the total employee pool, are paid on an hourly basis. Most \nof KLC OpCo's remaining employees, including District Managers as well as most corporate staff, are \nsalaried. KLC believes that its relations with its employees are good. \nKLC OpCo's management believes that its below-industry average turnover rates are a result of its hiring \npractices and closer involvement in center operations, a focus on treating teachers as educators and not \njust employees, and comprehensive training programs that are designed to ensure that teachers are \nsuccessful. KLC OpCo believes that it has the opportunity to reduce employee turnover further through \nimproved recruiting, training and management. \nThe following table presents \ta breakdown of employees as of December 31, 2005: \nKLC Employee Breakdown \nEmployee Type \tNumber \nTeachers and Center Staff \t37,440 \nCenter Directors \t1,874 \nCorporate \t592 \nFacilities \t218 \nField / Regional Staff \t107 \nTotal \t40,231 \n11.10. Accreditation \nKLC OpCo pursues accreditation of its centers by accrediting bodies, primarily the National Association for \nthe Education of Young Children (referred to herein as \"NAEYC\"), the nation's leading child care \naccreditation body. NAEYC accreditation criteria cover a wide range of quantitative and qualitative factors, \nincluding, among others, faculty qualifications and development, staffing ratios, health and safety and \nphysical environment. NAEYC criteria generally are more stringent than state regulatory requirements. As \nof December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo had 831 or approximately 43% of its total ECE centers that were \naccredited by NAEYC. Of the approximately 117,000 licensed centers in the U.S., approximately 10% \nare accredited by NAEYC. \nManagement believes that substantially all of its centers' operations and policies adhere to or are \nsubstantially compliant with NAEYC accreditation requirements. Since the accreditation process is \nexpensive, KLC OpCo intends to seek accreditation only where it believes accreditation will provide \nmeaningful local marketing benefits or competitive advantages. \n11.11. Licensing and Government Regulation \nEach early childhood care and education center and most school programs must be licensed under \napplicable state or local licensing laws. Responsibility for licensing and compliance with government \nregulations is at the regional and local level. Licenses are held at the center level or by the school \nprogram and are typically good for a minimum of one year. Generally, the center or school program will \n89 \n\freapply for a license on an annual basis, and that process may include a visit from the applicable state \nregulator. Renewal of a license is generally a fairly routine process. \nIn addition, each ECE center or school program is subject to a variety of state and local regulations. \nAlthough these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, governmental agencies generally \nreview the safety, staff qualifications, fitness and adequacy of the buildings and equipment; the ratio of \nstaff to children; the dietary program; the daily curriculum and compliance with health and transportation \nstandards. In most jurisdictions, these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of \nlocations. Repeated failures by a location to comply with applicable regulations can subject it to \nsanctions that might include probation or, in more serious cases, suspension or revocation of the center's \nor program's license to operate and could also lead to sanctions against the Company's other centers or \nprograms located in the same jurisdiction. In addition, this type of action could lead to negative publicity \nextending beyond that jurisdiction. \nKLC OpCo generally seeks to operate centers and school programs in states with strict regulations in \norder to avoid unexpected expense and market disruption that may be caused by compliance with \nregulations adopted in states that previously lacked such regulations. \nKLC OpCo believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all material regulations \napplicable to its business. However, a licensing authority may determine that a particular center or school \nprogram is in violation of applicable regulations and may take action against that center or program and \npossibly other centers in the same jurisdiction. In addition, there may be unforeseen changes in \nregulations and licensing requirements, such as changes in the required ratio of child center staff \npersonnel to enrolled children, which could have a material adverse effect on KLC OpCo's operations. \nStates in which KLC OpCo operates routinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing \nrequirements and implement changes which may significantly increase its costs to operate in those states. \nThe SES programs are operated in substantial compliance with the federal No Child Left Behind Act, as \nwell as applicable state Department of Education regulations that vary from state to state, but generally \nregulate curriculum, staff qualifications, and program quality and effectiveness. KLC OpCo must receive \napproval from each state's Department of Education in order to qualify as an SES provider. The length of \napproval to be an SES provider varies, but is typically from one to five years. Repeated failure by an SES \nprovider to comply with regulations or its request for proposal documentation may cause the provider to \nlose its approval. \nFederal regulations and licensing requirements require compliance with minimum standards in order to \nqualify for participation in federal assistance programs. Under the Social Security Act, the U.S. federal \ngovernment has established programs to assist low-income families with early childhood care and \neducation expenses. These programs include the Childcare and Development Block Grant and At Risk \nProgram. Funding is typically provided through block grants to states and counties, which then \nadminister the programs through local agencies. \nThe federal Americans with Disabilities Act, referred to as the ADA, and similar state laws prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Compliance with the \nADA requires that public accommodations reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that \nnew construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless \nstructurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance \nwith the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private \nlitigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. KLC OpCo has not \nexperienced any material adverse impact as a result of these laws. \nSection 21 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), provides for an income \ntax credit ranging from 20% to 35% of certain child care expenses subject to certain maximum limitations. \nThe fees paid to KLC OpCo for early childhood care and educational services by eligible taxpayers qualify \nfor the tax credit, subject to the limitations of the Code. In addition, Section 45F of the Code provides \n90 \n\fincentives to families and employers to offset costs related to employer-provided child care facilities. \nHowever, these tax incentives are subject to change. \nKLC OpCo is also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum \nwages, overtime compensation and working conditions. All of KLC OpCo's employees are paid at rates \nequal to or higher than the federal minimum wage. \nKLC OpCo is also subject to laws regulating its transportation of children. In 1998, the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, issued interpretive letters stating that automobile dealers may no \nlonger sell 12 to 15-passenger vans intended to be used for the transportation of children to and from \nschool by child care providers and that any vehicle designed to transport 11 persons or more must meet \nfederal school bus standards if it is likely to be used significantly to transport children to and from school \nor school-related events. These interpretations and related changes in state and federal transportation \nregulations have affected the type of vehicle that the company may purchase for use in transporting \nchildren between schools and its centers and, in effect, required KLC OpCo to replace its remaining fleet \nof vans with school buses over time. These changes have increased the company's costs to transport \nchildren because school buses are more expensive to purchase and maintain and, in some jurisdictions, \nrequire drivers with commercial licenses. \n11.12. Insurance \nKLC OpCo's insurance program currently includes the following types of policies: workers' compensation, \ncommercial general liability, automobile liability, property, excess \"umbrella\" liability, directors' and \nofficers' liability and employment practices liability. These policies provide for a variety of coverages, \nwhich are subject to various limits, and include substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions. Special \ninsurance is sometimes obtained with respect to specific hazards, if deemed appropriate and available at \na reasonable cost. Claims in excess of, or not included within, KLC's coverage may be asserted or \ncoverage may not be available due to insurance company failures or other reasons. \nKLC OpCo maintained either a self-insured retention or a deductible for a portion of its general liability, \nworkers' compensation, auto, property and employee medical insurance programs. It purchases stop \nloss coverage in order to mitigate its potential future losses. The nature of these liabilities, which may not \nfully manifest themselves for several years, requires significant judgment. KLC OpCo estimates the \nobligations for liabilities incurred but not yet reported or paid based on available claims data and historical \ntrends and experience, as well as future projections of ultimate losses, expenses, premiums and \nadministrative costs. While the company believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are \nsufficient, any significant increase in the number of claims and/or costs associated with claims made \nunder these programs could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. \n11.13. Legal Issues \nKLC OpCo does not believe that there are any pending or threatened legal proceedings that, if adversely \ndetermined, would have a material adverse effect on its business or operations. However, it is subject to \nclaims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims and litigation involving \nallegations of physical or sexual abuse of children. Although KLC OpCo cannot be assured of the \nultimate outcome of the allegations, claims or lawsuits of which it is aware, it has not historically had to \npay any claims exceeding its insurance coverage, and management believes that none of these \nallegations, claims or lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect \non the Company's financial position, operating results or cash flows. In addition, it cannot predict the \nnegative impact of publicity that may be associated with any such allegation, claim or lawsuit. \n91 \n\f11.14. Real Estate \nAs a result of a November 9, 2005 Real Estate Transaction, substantially all of the real estate owned by \nKLC OpCo was transferred to KLC PropCo. Although the expectation is that newly acquired real estate \nwill be owned by KLC PropCo and leased back to KLC OpCo, KLC OpCo continues to be actively \ninvolved in new center design, development and management. In addition to development of new \ncenters, the team is responsible for maintaining existing centers. The real estate group within KLC OpCo \nis headed by Wayne Pipes, Vice President. \n11.15. Environmental \nKLC OpCo is not aware of any existing environmental conditions that currently or in the future could \nreasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operating results or \ncash flows. It has not incurred material expenditures to address environmental conditions at any property. \nHowever, it has not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of its owned and leased centers. \nConsequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which it is unaware. \nIn addition, future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability, and the \ncurrent environmental condition of the centers may be adversely affected by conditions at locations in the \nvicinity of those centers (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties \nunrelated to the company. \n11.16. Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion \nThe following summary historical and projected financial data should be read in conjunction with the \nfinancial statements and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC's Pro Forma Results of \nOperations\" presented elsewhere in this Memorandum. See also \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" \nelsewhere in this Memorandum for a discussion of the derivation and limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and \nAdjusted EBITDAR. The historical information is pro forma for the effects of the acquisition of KinderCare \nin January 2005 and the separation of KLC into KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo in November 2005, as if \nthose transactions and related financing had occurred on January 1, 2004. \nKLC OpCo's pro forma results reflect KLC's consolidated pro forma results adjusted to include $96.3 \nmillion of rent expense payable to KLC PropCo. \nProjected results presented below are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, \nbut which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. KLC OpCo's ability to perform as projected \ndepends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty and actual performance could \nbe adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in \"Risk Factors,\" particularly the \nrisk factor related to projections elsewhere in this Memorandum.

Most of the projected growth stems from KLC OpCo's ECE segment which currently accounts for \napproximately 96.0% of KLC OpCo's pro forma revenue. The following table shows projected revenue by \nbusiness segment: \n93 \n\fKLC OpCo \n($ in millions) \t2006P \t2007P \t2008P \t2009P \t2010P \t2011P \nECE Centers \t$1,488.7 \t$1,572.8 \t$1,668.4 \t$1,797.1 \t$1,947.4 \t$2,111.1 \nSchool Partnerships \t55.5 \t66.6 \t79.9 \t95.9 \t115.1 \t138.1 \nKC Distance Learning \t13.6 \t17.1 \t21.3 \t26.7 \t33.3 \t41.6 \nTotal Revenue \t$1,557.8 \t$1,656.5 \t$1,769.6 \t$1,919.7 \t$2,095.8 \t$2,290.8 \nSales Growth \nFrom 2006 to 2011 KLC OpCo projects that revenue from the ECE centers will grow at a 7.2% CAGR. \nThe growth forecast is based on the following assumptions: \n. Tuition growth. KLC OpCo projects that tuition rates at existing centers will grow at \napproximately 4% per year for the next five years. This growth is below recent experience \n(6.9% in 2005). Moreover, tuition rates in the industry have been growing at average rates of \ngreater than 4%. \nr. Utilization improvement. Management projects that recent improvements witnessed at KLC \nOpCo will continue. By 2011, KLC OpCo projects Utilization will have increased to 65.2%. \nManagement believes these improvements in Utilization will be the result of expected \nfavorable demographic trends (described elsewhere in this Memorandum), new sales training \nprograms, re-branding efforts in selected markets combined with the opening of appropriately \nsized centers. \n. New centers. KLC OpCo expects a net reduction of centers in 2006 and 2007 as it \ncompletes its integration of KinderCare and the rationalization of its properties. Beginning in \n2008, KLC OpCo projects to be adding net centers. \nKLC OpCo \n2005PF \t2006P \t2007P \t2008P \t2009P \t2010P \t2011P \nUtilization \t61.2% \t62.2% \t63.0% \t63.5% \t63.9% \t64.5% \t65.2% \nAverage Weekly Tuition \t$167.35 \t$173.68 \t$179.99 \t$188.37 \t$197.47 \t$206.95 \t$216.52 \n% Growth \t3.7% \t3.6% \t4.7% \t4.8% \t4.8% \t4.6% \nCenter Count \nBeginning of Period \t2,021 \t1,934 \t1,894 \t1,878 \t1,890 \t1,925 \t1,963 \nNew Center Additions \t10 \t10 \t24 \t52 \t75 \t78 \t80 \nClosures \t(97) \t(50) \t(40) \t(40) \t(40) \t(40) \t(40) \nEnd of Period \t1,934 \t1,894 \t1,878 \t1,890 \t1,925 \t1,963 \t2,003 \nAdditional Products and Services \nKLC OpCo plans to use its footprint of approximately 2,000 centers across the U.S. as a platform to sell \nadditional educational (e.g., supplemental phonics, math, Spanish and music courses) and non-\neducational (e.g., health insurance, childcare financing) products and services. The sale of additional \nproducts and services is expected to generate approximately 2.2% of total revenue in 2011, which is \nincluded in the ECE center projections. \n94 \n\fSchool Partnerships \nSchool Partnerships is projected to grow from $48.5 million in pro forma revenues in 2005 to $138.1 \nmillion in 2011. As a percentage of revenue, School Partnerships accounts for 3.3% of total pro forma \nrevenue in 2005, and is projected to grow to 6.0% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in the School \nPartnerships business will be primarily driven by growth in the SES market (more school districts required \nto offer supplemental services), and an increase in the number of parent pay locations in the U.S. \nKC Distance Learning \nKCDL is projected to grow from $10.0 million in pro forma revenues in 2005 to $41.6 million in 2011. As a \npercentage of revenue, KCDL accounts for 0.7% of total pro forma revenue in 2005, and is projected to \ngrow to 1.8% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in this line will predominantly come from the \nexpansion of KCDL's direct to family business (which currently accounts for approximately 90% of pro \nforma revenue) and the expansion of states to digital high school courses (which KLC believes it is in a \nposition to provide on an outsourced basis). \nGross Margin \nKLC OpCo's pro forma gross profit is projected to increase from $244.4 million in 2005 to $501.3 million \nin 2011. The growth in gross profit is projected to be largely driven by increased center efficiency as a \nresult of improved Utilization, continued tuition increases and the closure of underperforming centers and \nshift in the revenue mix to more profitable business lines (Le., more employer-sponsored centers, KCDL, \nancillary products and services). KLC OpCo's gross margin is projected to improve from approximately \n16.5% of total revenues in fiscal year 2006 to 21.9% in fiscal year 2011 as a result of these factors. \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \nDue to the relatively fixed nature of KLC OpCo's selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, \nKLC OpCo projects that SG&A will increase at a rate of 4.5% annually after 2006. Additionally, \nmanagement estimates that there will be a one-time increase of $2.0 in SG&A related to the expansion of \nthe SES business in 2007. \nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins \nKLC OpCo projects improving pro forma Adjusted EBITDA from $149.9 million in fiscal year 2005 to \n$320.1 million in fiscal year 2011. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve from 10.1% \nin fiscal year 2005 to 14.0% in fiscal year 2011. This projected margin improvement reflects the \ncombination of increasing sales and margin improvements outlined above.

Under this new plan, which provides performance-based \nincentive compensation awards beginning in 2006 based on our performance against specific Adjusted \nEBITDA targets, we will accrue expenses ranging from $2.6 million in 2006 to $15.2 million in 2011 if our \nAdjusted EBITDA meets the projections set forth in this Memorandum. Each award is payable at the end \nof three years based on performance and subject to continued employment (with certain exceptions). \nThe accrued expenses associated with an award in each period are non-cash, subject to cash settlement \nwhen and if the award for that period is earned at the end of the third year.

In addition, KLC \nOpCo expects to spend approximately $19 million in 2006 on corporate infrastructure improvements, \nprimarily IT spending. The remainder of KLC's OpCo capital expenditures is projected to be used to \nexpand KLC OpCo's center base.

At December 31, \n2005, KLC had no revolving loans outstanding and approximately $46.6 million in letters of credit \noutstanding under the Revolver. KLC pays a commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum on the undrawn \nportion available under the Revolver and a fee of 1.25% per annum of the daily amount available to be \ndrawn under outstanding letters of credit. \n97 \n\fBorrowings under the Revolver will generally bear interest based on a margin over, at KLC OpCo's option, \neither the base rate (generally the applicable prime lending rate, as announced from time to time) or the \nreserve adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for revolving loans will be 0.25% for base rate loans \nand 1.25% for reserve adjusted LIBOR loans. KLC is permitted to voluntarily prepay principal amounts \noutstanding or reduce commitments under the Revolver at any time, in whole or in part, without premium \nor penalty. \nThe Revolver is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by KSI and on a joint and several basis by most of \nKLC's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries within KLC OpCo. The Revolver and guarantees are \nsecured by first priority security interests in, and liens on, substantially all of KLC OpCo's and the \nguarantors' assets and first priority pledges of all the equity interests owned by KSI in KLC and owned by \nKLC in its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries in KLC OpCo and 66% of the equity interests owned \nby KLC in its non-domestic subsidiaries. \nThe revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for financings of its \ntype (with customary exceptions). The financial covenants include: a minimum fixed charge coverage \nratio test; a minimum leverage ratio test; a minimum interest coverage ratio test; and a minimum EBITDA \ntest. \nOperating covenants limit KLC's and its restricted subsidiaries, and in certain cases, KSI's ability to \n(among others): incur additional debt; incur liens or other encumbrances; make investments; make \nacquisitions; incur certain contingent liabilities; make certain restricted junior payments and other similar \ndistributions; enter into mergers, consolidations and similar combinations; sell assets or engage in similar \ntransfers; open new learning centers; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback \ntransactions; engage in businesses other than those in which KLC and its restricted subsidiaries and KSI \nwere engaged at the time of the closing of the Revolver and other related or ancillary businesses; amend \ncertain material agreements; prepay subordinated debt; sell or discount receivables; and dispose of any \nequity securities in its subsidiaries. \n11.19. Terms of Senior Subordinated Notes \nIn February 2005, KLC sold $260.0 million in aggregate principal amount of PA% Senior Subordinated \nNotes due February 1, 2015 (the \"Notes\") in connection with the KinderCare acquisition and related \nfinancing transactions. The Notes bear interest at the rate of VA% per year, payable semi-annually, in \narrears, on February 1 and August 1 of each year. \nKLC may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on or after February 1, 2010 at certain pre-set \nredemption prices, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. On or prior to February 1, 2010 KLC may \nredeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of \nthe Notes to be redeemed plus an applicable premium. In addition, on or prior to February 1, 2008 KLC \nmay redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds of one or \nmore qualified equity offerings. \nSubject to KLC's right to redeem the Notes, upon a change of control event, holders of the Notes may \nrequire KLC to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes at a purchase price of 101% of their principal \namount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. \nKLC's obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed on a \nsenior subordinated basis by most of KLC's domestic restricted subsidiaries within KLC OpCo. \nThe indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that limit KLC and its restricted subsidiaries' ability \nto, among other things: (a) pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make other restricted payments and \ninvestments; (b) incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; (c) enter into agreements that restrict KLC \nsubsidiaries from paying dividends or other distributions, making loans or otherwise transferring assets to \n95 \n\fKLC or to any other subsidiaries; (d) create liens on assets; (e) engage in transactions with affiliates; (f) \nsell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries, except permitted real estate transfers and other \npermitted transfers; and (g) merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of KLC's assets and the \nassets of KLC's subsidiaries except permitted real estate transfers and other permitted transfers. \n11.20. Stockholders Agreement of Knowledge Schools, Inc. \nKLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of KSI, and KSI pursues no other businesses independent of holding \nKLC's stock/equity. KSI entered into a Stockholders Agreement on May 9, 2003 with Knowledge \nUniverse Learning Corp. (the \"KSI Parent\") and its minority stockholders (the \"Stockholders\"). The \nAgreement provides (a) the KSI Parent (and/or any \"Parent Entities\" designated by the KSI Parent, which \ninclude the KSI Parent and/or certain of the Principals and certain affiliates of the KSI Parent and the \nPrincipals) with a right of first refusal over proposed transfers of other Stockholders' shares, subject to \ncertain exceptions; (b) Stockholders, to the extent they are accredited investors, with a right to invest in \nnew issuances of KSI shares; (c) Stockholders with tag-along rights in connection with a transfer of KSI \ncommon stock by any of the Parent Entities resulting in the Parent Entities owning less than 60% of KSI \ncommon stock then outstanding, or a transfer of securities by any of the Parent Entities resulting in the \nParent Entities owning less than a majority of KSI common stock then outstanding. Stockholders are also \nsubject to a drag-along provision, pursuant to which they may be required to sell a pro rata portion of their \nshares in the event of a proposed transfer of a majority of KSI common stock then outstanding. Each \nStockholder and the KSI Parent are entitled to receive certain financial information from KS]. The \nAgreement terminates upon a public offering of KSI, at the option of the KSI Parent upon a sale of KSI, or \nby written agreement of the parties. Knowledge Universe Learning Corp. was liquidated on October 27, \n2004 and the shares of KSI were distributed on that date to its sole stockholder, KUE Inc. \n99 \n\f12. THE REAL ESTATE COMPANY (\"KLC PROPCO\") \nOn November 9, 2005, KLC transferred ownership of 845 ECE centers into wholly owned, bankruptcy \nremote subsidiaries, which are referred to as KLC PropCo. In October 2005, 713 of the centers were \nindependently appraised at approximately $1.1 billion.36 KLC PropCo then issued $700 million of CMBS \ndebt secured by the 713 appraised centers and the stock of the CMBS borrower, and $150 million of \njunior mezzanine debt, the proceeds of which were used to repay KLC OpCo debt. The table below \nsummarizes the revised corporate structure at KLC: \nKLC OpCo \n• $100.0 million Revolver \n• $16.4 million Capital \nLeases \n• $260.0 million Sr. \nSubordinated Notes \nOperating Company \n77.-------- \n• 845 Properties \n• $699.4 million CMBS Debt \nK.... • $150.0 million Junior \nMezzanine Debt(” \nKLC PropCo \nRepresents face value; book value is approximately $147.3 million. \nReal Estate Company \nWith 845 ECE centers in 37 states (as of December 31, 2005), KLC PropCo believes it is the largest \nprivate owner of education real estate assets in the world. The real estate portfolio is geographically \ndiversified without significant concentrations or ties to any single part of the U.S. KLC PropCo leases its \ncenters to KLC OpCo for an aggregate annual rent of $96.3 million. The lease agreement, which was \nsigned in November 2005, carries an initial term of 15 years with two extensions available for five years \neach and an escalation of rent by the lesser of 7% or the CPI every fifth year. All of the properties have \nbeen leased to KLC OpCo on a \"triple-net\" basis, requiring KLC OpCo to fund all property taxes, \ninsurance expenses related to the properties and all maintenance capital expenditures. For the fiscal \nyear ended December 31, 2005, KLC PropCo generated pro forma rental revenue of $96.3 million and \nEBITDA of $88.1 million. \n12.1. KLC PropCo Strategy \nKLC PropCo was separated from KLC OpCo to create a flexible vehicle to address the growing \nopportunity in education related real estate. The ongoing need for facility-based education is driving \nincreased demand for real estate assets that can accommodate the facilities. \n3° Actual appraisal was for 713 centers and the appraised value was $1.1 billion. The $1.25 billion referred to within this Memorandum is achieved by \ntaking the independent appraisal valuation methodology and extrapolating it to the remaining 132 centers. \n100 \n\f• Leverage Greenstreet Real Estate Partners' significant expertise: \n— KLC believes it is able to better maximize the potential of its real estate assets by having them \nmanaged by a dedicated and highly experienced team at Greenstreet Real Estate Partners rather \nthan having them managed at the operating company level. \n• Cash generated will be reinvested in acquiring more assets. \n• Diversify the real estate portfolio: \n— The Greenstreet Real Estate Partners team is actively looking at diversification and reinvestment \nopportunities for the real estate portfolio. The diversification strategy will include some \nopportunistic investments in non-education related real estate assets. \n12.2. Management Team \nKLC PropCo is managed by Greenstreet Real Estate Partners through a long-term agreement. \nGreenstreet Real Estate Partners has a highly experienced management team to guide the continued \nacquisition and diversification of the real estate portfolio. The management team includes Steven Green, \nChairman and CEO of Greenstreet Real Estate Partners, Jeffrey Safchik, COO and CFO and Steven Cox, \nExecutive Vice President Real Estate. Greenstreet Real Estate Partners controls a significant portfolio of \nowned and self-managed real estate and has extensive experience in corporate transactions involving \nowned real estate. Greenstreet Real Estate Partners operates a private real estate equity platform, \nhaving made in excess of $850 million in acquisitions and with assets currently under management \n(excluding KLC PropCo) of $540 million. It has owned and managed in excess of 10 million square feet \nof shopping centers with value in excess of $1 billion. The principals of Greenstreet Real Estate Partners \neach have in excess of 20 years in real estate and capital markets. Their biographies can be found in \nAppendix A. \n12.3. Description of the Real Estate Assets \nThe highly diversified portfolio includes 845 properties in 37 states. The properties are primarily one story \nwood-framed buildings totaling 5,119,320 sq. ft. Some of the larger state concentrations include Texas, \nCalifornia, Illinois and Virginia. No single state accounts for more than 11% of the total centers (see the \nFigure below for details on the geographic distribution). The properties are single-tenant stand-alone \nbuildings. The average age of the properties is approximately 15 years with 22% of the portfolio built \nafter 1991 and approximately 6% of the facilities being constructed prior to 1979. The centers' trailing 12 \nmonth Utilization was 58.9% as of December 31, 2005. \n101 \n\f845 Centers in 37 States \n12.4. Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion \nThe table below shows KLC PropCo pro forma historical results for 2005 assuming the division of KLC \nOpCo and KLC PropCo in the series of transactions completed in November 2005 (the \"Real Estate \nTransactions\") and related financing, together with the lease of KLC PropCo-owned centers to KLC OpCo, \noccurred on January 1, 2004. Projected results presented below are based on assumptions management \nbelieves to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. KLC PropCo's \nability to perform as projected depends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty \nand actual performance could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in \n\"Risk Factors,\" particularly the risk factor related to projected financial statements, elsewhere in this \nMemorandum.

The growth stems from \nKLC PropCo's reinvestment of excess cash flow in additional real estate and rent increases in the \nproperties leased to KLC OpCo as described below: \nIntercompany Rent. KLC PropCo currently leases 847 properties (845 childcare centers) to KLC for a \ntotal annual rent payment of $96.3 million. The rent on the properties is fixed for the first five years of the \nlease, at which point it increases by the lesser of the CPI growth over the five years or 7%. \nAdditional Real Estate. KLC PropCo has projected that it will invest all excess cash (anything over $5.0 \nmillion) in additional real estate. The additional real estate may be comprised of either educational or \nnon-educational assets, but will not be leased back to KLC OpCo. KLC PropCo has projected that it will \ninvest its capital at an 8.25% cap rate. \n103 \n\fReal Estate Company Operating Expenses \nGreenstreet Real Estate Partners will operate all of the real estate investment functions on behalf of KLC \nPropCo as detailed in the management agreement.

(\"k12\") \nk12, headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a curriculum company and management company for \nkindergarten through ninth grade (grades 10-12 currently in development). k12 is the largest operator of \nK-12 virtual schools in the world. k12's mission is to enable delivery of world-class education for students \nin grades K-12, consisting of comprehensive online and offline curriculum that supports numerous \napplications. k12 has invested more than $70 million in building a state-of-the-art curriculum offering, \nintegrated assessment and the supporting technology delivery systems. \n13.1. History \nk12 was founded in December 1999, with the goal of leveraging technology to create the highest-quality \ncurriculum. k12 launched its first offering in September 2001 for students in grades K-2. This offering \nwas launched in conjunction with several of the world's leading education experts and included interactive \nlessons in Language Arts, Math, Science, History, Art and Music. k12 launched grades 3-5 in the fall of \n2002, grades 6 and 7 in the fall of 2003, grade 8 in the fall of 2004 and grade 9 in fall of 2005. k12 has \ncontinually improved its production process and is now producing courses that are of higher quality and at \na lower cost per lesson than it originally produced. Building the service in this modular, rolling fashion \nallows k12 to capture students at an early stage and to build out its product offerings in alignment with \nstudent progress. \n13.2. Current Operations \nk12 provides a world-class education for its students which combines a comprehensive online and offline \ncurriculum with integrated assessments and supporting technology delivery systems. k12 currently \nprovides its education to grades K-9 through more than 7,000 interactive lessons, and is in the process of \ndeveloping content for grades 10-12. Today, k12 sells its curriculum through the following channels: \n• Virtual public schools (91% of 2006E Revenue) \n— k12 is the largest curriculum and management provider to virtual public schools in the U.S. \n— k12 offers its curriculum directly to the rapidly growing virtual school market (projected to be offered \nto 24,000 students in 2007) \n• District-managed virtual programs (3% of 2006E Revenue) \n— k12 sells the curriculum and technology directly to school districts who mange their own virtual \nschools \n— This is a fairly new initiative for k12 but is expected to be a larger part of total revenue over time \n• School districts for traditional classrooms (3% of 2006E Revenue) \n— k12's science curriculum has been piloted as the science curriculum in various school districts \nincluding Philadelphia \n— Initial results are promising \n• Direct to consumer (3% of 2006E Revenue) \n— To parents who prefer home-schooling or want to augment or enhance their children's public or \nprivate school education \n106 \n\fk12 intends to expand the business to international markets and believes there is a significant worldwide \ndemand for high-quality online curriculum. In the near-term it can do so by serving multinational \ncorporations with large employee bases comprised of expatriates. \nk12 generated $6 million of revenue in 2002, its first year of operations, growing to more than $116.0 \nmillion projected for FYE June 30, 2006. \n13.3. Virtual Schools and District-Managed Virtual Programs (94% 2006E Revenue) \nThe past decade has seen an increase in the number of contracts and charters awarded to Education \nManagement Organizations (\"EMOs\"), which manage traditional K-12 public schools on behalf of a school \ndistrict (\"contract schools\") or manage charter schools either as the charter holder (\"charter schools\") or \nunder contract with the charter holder (\"contract charters\"). In the early half of the 1990's, EMOs were \nmostly contract schools, managing traditional K-12 schools on behalf of school districts. Later, as public \nmoney became available to charter schools through the use of vouchers, these organizations moved \ntoward charter school management and contract charter management. \nA movement toward alternatives to the public school system is expected to generate substantial growth in \nthe for-profit EMO sector. Alternative schools and alternative management programs provide a significant \nopportunity to improve the current educational \"product.\" Furthermore, under the NCLB, growth in public \nschool management is expected to continue as schools that fail to achieve \"Adequate Yearly Progress\" \n(\"AYP\") for four consecutive years are subject to one of the following sanctions: replacement of all or most \nstaff including the principal, state takeover of the school, hiring an outside entity to manage the school, or \nbecoming a charter school. k12 is well positioned to take advantage of these trends. \nTo comply with NCLB, all states submitted a plan to the Department of Education indicating baseline \nachievements for the 2002-03 school year and how 100% \"proficiency\" would be achieved by 2013-14. \nThe law mandates that student progress and achievement be measured (\"assessed\") by math and \nreading tests that will be given to every child, every year, beginning in the 2005-06 school year. In \naddition, a science assessment will be added beginning with the 2006-07 school year. Under Bush \nadministration proposals, by the 2009-10 school year, students will be tested every year from grades 3 to \n11. These assessments are considered intermediate benchmarks that measure a school's ability to \ndemonstrate \"Adequate Yearly Progress\" (AYP) toward meeting its own goals. \nContract Charters. Charter schools are independent public schools, designed and operated by \ncommunity groups or non-profit entities, but sponsored by designated local or state educational \norganizations that monitor their quality and integrity. In return for a large measure of autonomy and \nfreedom from regulation, charter schools are accountable for student academic performance. \nThe Center for Education Reform estimates that, in the 2004-05 school year, there were 3,345 charter \nschools serving nearly 894,000 students, representing an estimated 1.6% of total K-12 students. Charter \nschools now operate in 40 states and the District of Columbia, up from 38 in the 2003-04 school year. In \nthe 2004-05 school year, enrollment in charter schools represented 1.6% of total K-12 enrollment and \nannual spending on charter schools was $7 million or 1.4% of total spending on all K-12 schools. \nHowever, in the decade of 1995-2005 the number of charter schools had grown on average nearly 13% \nannually while charter school enrollment increased over 20%, clearly outpacing the less than 1% average \nK-12 enrollment growth over the same period.37 \nk12 participates in the charter school business by setting up virtual public schools that it manages through \na partnership with a non-profit entity. After going through the legislative process at the local or state level \nand obtaining a charter for a school, k12 sets up a non-profit organization with a principal and the right \nadministrative team to create the school. k12 then enters into a contract with the non-profit organization \n'7 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. \n107 \n\fwhereby k12 sets up and manages the \"virtual public\" school. k12 offers an Internet-based curriculum \n(providing the computer hardware and all necessary materials) outside of the conventional brick-and-\nmortar setting of traditional public and charter schools. Where legislation has enabled such schools, state \neducation dollars pay for children who enroll in them. Virtual schools generally generate substantially \nlarger profits than conventional for-profit charter schools because they receive the same amount of per-\nstudent funding as their traditional public school counterparts despite not having to support a physical \nstructure. Virtual schools enable students to receive a comprehensive curriculum along with technical \nassistance, teacher involvement, computer equipment, Internet access, and instructional materials, \nwithout leaving the public education system. Virtual academies are serving a diverse mix of students. \nWith the same curriculum, k12 is serving both highly gifted children and children with disabilities. The \nself-paced nature of k12's curriculum and its interactivity allow k12 to serve a broad array of students. \nk12's students, currently in virtual schools, come from public or private schooling backgrounds, as well as \nhome schooling backgrounds. A summary of k12's virtual school business is as follows: \n• k12 manages virtual schools for students in grades K-9 in 11 states (Arizona, Arkansas, California, \nColorado, Florida, Idaho, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin) plus the District of \nColumbia. In the 2006 fiscal year, these schools had a combined enrollment of approximately 18,000 \nchildren. \n• k12 managed schools typically produce test score results which exceed or are equal to state averages \nat a cost to the taxpayer that is approximately 70% less than what they would pay for traditional school. \n• Virtual schools are funded primarily through local, state, and federal sources, which k12 expects to \nreceive approximately $5,300 per student per school year on average. Therefore, the virtual schools \nprovide access to k12's world-class service and curriculum as well as certified teachers at no cost to \nthe family. \n• While many of k12's virtual academies are charter schools, k12 has virtual schools that are not charter \nschools but are programs of school districts or other authorized school agencies, such as public \nuniversities and federal and state agencies. \nDistrict-Managed Schools. k12's district-managed virtual programs operate under the contract schools \nmodel. Although somewhat similar to the virtual public schools, contract schools are public schools \noperated by private organizations based on management agreements with local school boards. Unlike \ncharter schools, contract schools do not require specific statutory authority but are created through a \ncontract between a school management company and a school board in accordance with existing \nauthority. k12 typically employs the district-managed virtual programs in states where the reimbursement \nrate is low. Two states where k12 currently has district-managed virtual programs are Kansas and Utah. \nThe district-managed virtual programs unit is expected to grow revenue from $3 million in FY 2006 to $11 \nmillion in FY 2008. \nThe Pennsylvania Department of Education commissioned KPMG Consulting to study virtual education in \nthat state. The October 2001 study stated that the Pennsylvania Virtual Charter School (which uses the \nk12 curriculum and management services) 'Was considered to be the highest quality program based on \nthe curriculum analysis.\" k12 believes that the virtual school market has powerful growth prospects which \nare outlined below: \n^ Strong reenrollment rates. k12 benefits from stable demand for its curriculum and services which is \nreflected by current reenrollment rates of approximately 70%. \n^ Increasing existing school enrollment rates. Existing school enrollments continue to increase at \ndouble digit rates. \n^ Expansion into new states. k12 is currently evaluating opportunities to start new virtual schools in \nseveral additional states. \n103 \n\f• Grade expansion. k12 continues to expand its curriculum and services and plans to begin \ndevelopment of grades 10-12 in the fall of 2006. \n• ADA funding. The level of funding generally increases at approximately 2% per year. \nWith four times the number of students of its next competitor, k12 is the largest for-profit manager of \nvirtual schools. \nVirtual Schools Managed by For-Profit Educational Management Companies \nCompany \nk12 \nWhite Hat Management \nConnections Academy \nPinnacle Education \nSequoia Charter Schools \nDesigns for Learning \nLocation \nMcLean, VA \nAkron, OH \nBaltimore, MD \nTempe, AZ \nMesa, AZ \nSt. Paul, MN \nPublic Schifolninder \nManagement \nNumber of which are Students in Virtual \nVirtual Schools \n15 15 \n38 2 \n10 10 \n9 1 \n11 1 \n10 1 \nNote: Schools ranked by students in 2004-05 school-year. \nSource: Harris Nesbitt based on information compiled by Education Policy Studies Research Unit at Arizona State University. \nSchools \n14,460 \n3,508 \n1,081 \n212 \n160 \n50 \n13.4. Curriculum to School Districts of Traditional Classrooms (3% 2006E Revenue) \nk12 piloted its core elementary school science program for several school districts, including Philadelphia. \nThe initial results of this pilot program were promising. \nCase Study: William H. Hunter Elementary School \nBackground. In the Spring of 2004 the School District of Philadelphia wished to give a rebirth to one of its \nlowest performing schools, the William H. Hunter Elementary School. k12 was selected as a partner to \nprovide innovative curriculum and professional development to implement a learning environment that \nleverages the latest technology. As part of the k12 implementation, the District outfitted each room with \nhigh-speed internet access, a ceiling-mounted data projection system, and interactive whiteboards. The \ngoal was to have Hunter become one of the District's, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's, first \nweb-based public, traditional schools. \nOf Hunter's 600 students, 95% qualify for the federal Free and Reduced Lunch program and 25% study \nEnglish as a Second Language (ESL). Therefore, the move and the District's initiative truly marked a \ntremendous opportunity for both Hunter's teachers and students alike. \nScope of Services. The fall of 2004 marked the official launch of the program and the k12 curriculum was \nprovided for all math, science, art and history courses. This included providing all curriculum components \nincluding text books, teacher guides, manipulatives, equipment, assessments, art supplies and all the \nonline lessons and teaching tools for these subjects. \nThe Hunter teaching staff did an impressive job of effectively implementing the program. k12 trainers \nworked closely with teachers to adopt the new curriculum and to share best methods on applying the \ntechnology. Throughout the year, k12 trainers were invited to attend and help present ongoing staff \ntrainings. Additionally, grade level teams and school leaders worked regularly with k12 to develop \ncoherent plans for boosting student achievement. \nResults / Conclusions: After the first full-year of implementing the k12 program, Hunter achieved \nimpressive gains on the state math exams.38 In third grade, there was a 46 percentage point increase (as \n38 The Pennsylvania Department of Education mandates all public schools in the Commonwealth implement its Pennsylvania System of State \nAssessment (PSSA). The PSSA is a standards-based exam for measuring specific skills in math and reading, and beginning in 2006-07 science. \n109 \n\fcompared to a 31 point increase for the District). This was a meaningful 86% performing at or above \nproficient compared to the District's 52% for 2005. In fifth grade, there was 22 percentage point gain (as \ncompared to a 15 point gain for the District). \nAs a result of these scores, the 3rd and 5th grade \nstudents met or exceeded the absolute AYP \ngoals for math instruction - a first for the school. \n(Note: k12 did not supply the Reading curriculum, \ntherefore, only Math results are applicable to the \nk12 program). \nThese gains are an extraordinary achievement for \na school and its district. They are also difficult to \nmaintain over time, however this goal is shared \nbetween the District and k12. The Hunter School \naccomplished these gains through the staff's hard \nwork, commitment to their students and \ndedication to implementing the k12 program. \nYear over Year PSSA Math Gains \n(2004 to 2005 % point increase) \nThird Grade \nHunter \nDistrict \nFifth Grade \nHunter \nDistrict \n22 \n31 \n46 \nNew programs often take two to three years to generate similar results. While k12 and the Hunter staff \nare pleased with the first year's results, it is only the beginning of a longer effort because, despite the \ngains, more than half of last year's fifth graders still did not score at or above their grade level. Therefore, \nalthough there is pride in the progress, the overall scores demonstrate how much more is to be done. \n13.5. Direct to Consumer (3% of 2006E Revenue) \nk12 sells its curriculum direct to consumers who either home school their children or use k12's curriculum \nto supplement their child's education. k12 believes that it offers children and their parents an education \ncomparable to that offered in the nation's best public and private schools, utilizing optimal multimedia \nmethods and research-tested approaches to learning. In addition, integrated assessments allow a parent \nto test his or her child's mastery of skills and enables the child to progress at the appropriate pace. \nChildren can move faster through lessons and address more challenging problems, while other children \ncan spend the additional time needed to master certain skills. With k12 's high standards and integrated \nassessments, a parent can be confident that his or her child has mastered the subject. k12 considers this \nmarket a growth area. \nEducating a child at home full time or part time is a time-consuming and daunting task for parents. \nParents and caregivers spend a considerable amount of time searching for curriculum and trying to \nensure they are teaching the material adequately to their children. k12 offers a solution to this challenge \nby offering a comprehensive curriculum for students in grades K-9, complete with specific daily lessons. \nParents can purchase individual or multiple courses. Although small, the home-schooling market is \ngrowing at a healthy pace. Approximately 1.1 million students—roughly 2% of total K-12 enrollment—\nwere home-schooled in spring 2003, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). \nThis represents a roughly 30% increase from spring 1999. Most home school parents cited concerns \nabout the school environment (31%), interest in providing religious instruction (30%) and overall \ndissatisfaction with academic instruction (16%) as their reasons for home schooling their children.39 \nThe exam is also used in assessing performance toward No Child Left Behind guidelines for grades 3, 5, 9 and 11. The goal of the exam is for \nstudents to score at or above proficient levels. Student results are also used to determine a school and district's performance in meeting pre-\ndetermined goals known as Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). \n39 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. \n110 \n\f13.6. Product Offering \nComprehensive K-9 Curriculum. k12 offers a comprehensive curriculum for grades K-9 directly to the \nstudents in its virtual academies, directly to consumers and to school districts, summer schools and after-\nschool programs. k12 is creating rich and challenging proprietary educational material based on existing \nbest-of-breed content and traditional methods enhanced by technology. Unlike most computer-based \neducation programs, which rely solely on computers and burden students with mechanical 'point and \nclick\" exercises, k12 uses the computer as only one among many complementary tools to open children's \nminds to the best books and educational material. k12's math, reading and writing curriculum involve a \nsignificant amount of off-line work in the form of books, audiotapes, science equipment, art supplies and \nmore. k12 provides some of these materials and others will be recommended but not required. \nFor example, k12's comprehensive curriculum for students in grades K-9 includes lessons in the following \nsubjects: \n• Language Arts. Progresses from a focus in the primary grades on early mastery of reading using \nphonics-based curriculum reviewed and revised by a team of renowned experts, to, in later grades, a \nrich program of literature, composition, and language skills; \n• Math. A solid early foundation in basic math based on a highly respected math curriculum and \nrigorous math standards; \n• History. In grades K-4, a proprietary k12 program that offers a chronological overview of history, from \nthe Stone Age to the Space Age, with integrated geography and civics; in middle school, an American \nHistory survey based on the celebrated History of the US series, and a World History survey based on \na proprietary k12 textbook; \n• Science. A world-class science curriculum focused on hand-on activities and basic principles driven \nby some of the most ambitious state science standards in the country; \n• Visual Arts. A curriculum that combines appreciation of historical trends and masterpieces with \nspecific skill building and many opportunities for creative work; and \n• Music. In the elementary grades, a proprietary program that engages young children in singing, \ndancing and creative movement while introducing them to great works of music from around the world. \nk12's curriculum and assessment are delivered, in part, through a series of proprietary course modules. \nk12 delivers material over the Internet, but also through other forms of media, including traditional books, \nvideo and learning kits. k12's course modules employ interactive text, audio, videos, CDs, and animated \ngraphics. The Internet-based portion of k12's courses contains the following features: \n• Integration of a diverse mix of materials—visual images and concepts, audio, videos and animated \nsequences, as well as high-quality written material; \n• Capabilities for users to see an overview of the whole module at a glance; \n• Opportunity for parents to scan and preview modules before guiding students through work; \n• Integrated assessment services; \n• Ability for children, parents, and teachers to follow students' progress; \n• Comprehensive teaching guides with \"drill down\" functionality for those parents requiring more detailed \ninstruction; and \n• Proven, standards-based, technologies that provide a satisfactory experience for the current Internet \ninfrastructure. \n111 \n\fk12 considers the majority of its entire curriculum proprietary, whether k12 is branding existing materials \nwith its logo and modifying the associated lesson plans or creating the entire course from scratch. k12's \nK-8 curriculum includes thousands of lessons that consist primarily of existing, high-quality materials that \nk12 has modified to better suit the needs of student, parent and teacher. \n13.7.

Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion \nThe following summary historical financial data and the percentages of expected 2006 revenue presented \nin the headings above are based on historical financial statements. The following projected financial data \npresented below is based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but which are \ninherently uncertain and may not be realized. k12's ability to perform as projected depends on a number \nof variables that cannot be predicted with certainty and actual performance could be adversely affected \nby a number of factors, including those described in \"Risk Factors,\" particularly the risk factor related to \nprojections elsewhere in this Memorandum.

Traditionally, k12's revenue growth has been driven by three major factors; (i) the addition of \ngrades, (ii) the addition of states and (iii) same-store growth in existing states. \nIn 2002 k12 began operations in two states (Colorado and Pennsylvania). In 2003 revenue grew to $30.9 \nmillion from $6.7 million during the 2002 fiscal year end. Growth was due to the addition of four new \nstates (Ohio, Idaho, California and Arkansas), three new grades and same store sales growth of \napproximately 40%. During 2004 revenue increased by 131.0% to $71.4 million. Revenue growth during \nthe 2004 fiscal year was due to the addition of five new states (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin \nand the District of Columbia) and two new grades. During the 2005 fiscal year k12 began to concentrate \non leveraging its scale to achieve profitability by slowing down curriculum production and not aggressively \npursuing new states. Revenue grew at a slower rate, but profitability increased as the growth in the \nexisting states continued. Existing state growth is more profitable than new state growth because each \nnew state requires a significant amount of fixed overhead to be added. \nThe projections of financial results presented above are based on the development and expansion of \nk12's operations in existing states and grades. Key growth drivers in the near term are expected to \ninclude high same-store growth rates and k12's ability to leverage its existing infrastructure for margin \nimprovement. Future drivers of growth at k12 which are not included in the projections are expected to \ninclude the addition of new states. In 2006, k12 opened in Texas, Wyoming and Washington. More \nrecently, the Chicago school board approved a virtual public school for the city of Chicago that will be \nmanaged by k12. k12 also received a charter in the Sacramento area of California that will allow it to \nserve a large area in California that it cannot currently serve. k12 is currently continuing to pursue \nopportunities in several other states. \nUnder k12's current revenue recognition policy, revenues are principally earned from contractual \nagreements to provide on-line curriculum, books, materials, computers and to manage and operate virtual \ncharter schools. In most contracts, k12 is responsible to the charter schools for all aspects of the \nmanagement of schools, including but not limited to the monitoring of the academic achievement of the \nstudents, training, and compensation of school personnel; and procurement of curriculum and equipment \nnecessary for operations of the schools. The schools receive funding on a per student basis from the \nstate in which the charter school or school district is located. Where k12 has determined that they are the \nprimary obligor for substantially all expenses under these contracts, k12 records the associated per \nstudent revenue received by the school from its state funding school district up to the expenses incurred \nin accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal \nVersus Net as an Agent. k12 has generally agreed to fund any operating losses of the schools in a given \nschool year; however, k12 is not entitled to any revenue in excess of expenses incurred on its contracts, \n113 \n\funless k12 incurred excess losses in prior years. For contracts in which k12 is not the primary obligor, \nk12 records revenue based on its net fees earned per the contractual agreement. \nUnder k12's current revenue recognition policy, k12 records revenue related to contracts with its virtual \nacademies primarily on a gross basis. As a result, k12 has recorded certain expenses of these virtual \nacademies in revenues and costs and expenses. These expenses were $25.4 million and $29.3 million \nfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004 and 2005 respectively. \n13.9. k12 Equity \nk12 has issued and outstanding approximately 45.1 million shares of Series C Preferred Stock, \napproximately 51.5 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock and approximately 10.0 million shares of \nCommon Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock is senior to the Series B Preferred Stock and the Common \nStock and has a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (a) two times the original cost of the Series \nC Preferred Stock (plus any accrued dividends) or (b) the amount which would be received upon \nconversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock. KUE owns approximately 40.0% of the \noutstanding Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock has a dividend rate of 10% per \nannum, compounded annually with such dividends being paid in the form of additional shares of Series C \nPreferred Stock. \nThe Series B Preferred Stock is senior to the Common Stock and has a liquidation preference equal to \nthe greater of (a) two times the original cost of the Series B Preferred Stock or (b) the amount which \nwould be received upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock. KUE owns \napproximately 7.5% of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock. The holders of the Series B Preferred \nStock do not receive dividends. \nKUE does not own any shares of Common Stock. However, both the Series B Preferred Stock and the \nSeries C Preferred Stock are convertible into k12 Common Stock, and on an as-if-converted, fully-diluted \nbasis KUE owns approximately 17.9% of k12's Common Stock. \n114 \n\f14. THE STRUCTURE OF KUE AND THE GENERAL PARTNER \nThe following information is a summary of the principal terms of the organizational documents of KUE and \nthe General Partner. The information below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and \nRestated Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE and the organizational documents of the General \nPartner, including the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of the General \nPartner and the Agreement Among Members of the General Partner (the \"Organizational Documents), \ncopies of which have been provided or are available upon request In the event of any inconsistency \nbetween the terms herein and the terms of the Organizational Documents, the Organizational Documents \nshall control. \n14.1. KUE \nKUE is constituted as a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership under the Exempted Limited \nPartnership Law (2003 Revision) (the \"ELP Law\"). A Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership is \nconstituted by the signing of the relevant partnership agreement and its registration with the Registrar of \nExempted Limited Partnerships in the Cayman Islands. \nNotwithstanding registration, an exempted limited partnership is not a separate legal person distinct from \nits partners. Under Cayman Islands law, any property of the exempted limited partnership shall be held or \ndeemed to be held by the general partner, and if more than one then by the general partners jointly upon \ntrust, as an asset of the partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. Similarly, \nthe general partner for and on behalf of the partnership incurs the debts or obligations of the exempted \nlimited partnership. Registration under the ELP Law entails that the partnership becomes subject to, and \nthe limited partners therein are afforded the limited liability and other benefits of the ELP Law. \nThe business of an exempted limited partnership will be conducted by its general partner(s) who will be \nliable for all debts and obligations of the exempted limited partnership to the extent the partnership has \ninsufficient assets. As a general matter, a limited partner of an exempted limited partnership will not be \nliable for the debts and obligations of the exempted limited partnership save (i) as expressed in the \npartnership agreement, 00 if such limited partner becomes involved in the conduct of the partnership's \nbusiness or (Hi) if such limited partner is obliged pursuant to Section 14(1) of the ELP Law to return a \ndistribution made to it where the exempted limited partnership is insolvent. \nThe Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of the \nGeneral Partner to the Limited Partners of KUE (the \"Limited Partners,\" and, together with the General \nPartner, the \"Partners\") to the full extent of applicable law. The Limited Partnership Agreement also \nrestricts the remedies available to the Limited Partners for actions that might otherwise constitute a \nbreach of the General Partner's fiduciary duties owed to the Limited Partners. By purchasing Units, \nInvestors are treated as having consented to various actions contemplated in the Limited Partnership \nAgreement and conflicts of interest that might otherwise be considered a breach of fiduciary or other \nduties under applicable Cayman law. \n14.2. The General Partner \nThe General Partner is incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability \nunder the Companies Law (2004 Revision) (the \"Companies Law\"). The Memorandum and Articles of \nAssociation comprise the constitution of General Partner. The principal business purpose of the General \nPartner is to act as the general partner of KUE, to own interests in KUE and to engage in activities related \nthereto (the \"Business Purpose\"). The General Partner will not engage in material activities (including \nholding any material assets or incurring any material liabilities) unrelated to the Business Purpose. The \nGeneral Partner has no prior operating history or prior business and will not have any substantial assets or \n115 \n\fliabilities other than in connection with its acting as general partner of KUE and as described in this \nMemorandum. \nThe day to day business of the General Partner will be generally be conducted by its directors, although \ncertain matters require the approval of its shareholders pursuant to the Companies Law and the General \nPartner's Articles of Association. Under Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is \nobliged to comply with a number of duties, breach of which may, in certain circumstances, result in \npersonal liability on the part of the director. However, provided a director complies with the fiduciary \nduties and the requisite duties of care, diligence and skill, the fact that a decision turns out to be wrong, \nnot beneficial, or causes loss, will not of itself necessarily establish personal liability. \nAs a general rule, in the absence of a contractual arrangement to the contrary, the liability of a \nshareholder of a Cayman Islands exempted company which has been incorporated with limited liability is \nlimited to the amount from time to time unpaid in respect of the par value of, together with the share \npremium payable on, the shares he holds; the company having a separate legal personality from that of \nits shareholders, and being separately liable for its own debts due to third parties. However, although \nthere is no decided Cayman Islands authority on the issue, English common law authority (which would \nbe regarded as persuasive, though technically not binding, in the courts of the Cayman Islands), supports \nthe proposition that it in exceptional circumstances it is conceivable that the principle of the separate legal \npersonality of a company could be ignored and the court will \"pierce the corporate veil.\" Examples might \nbe a company acting as the agent or nominee of its shareholder, incorporation for an illegal or improper \npurpose, using a company or group of companies as a means of perpetrating a fraud, or using the \nseparate personality of a company to circumvent a pre-existing obligation of its proprietor. \n14.3. Classes of Units; Capital Contributions \nAssuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by March 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends \non the preferred limited partner units are paid in cash, approximately 2,530,000 Units will be outstanding. \nThe Investors will own approximately 40% of KUE in the form of Common LP Units and approximately \n40% of the General Partner in the form of Class A Shares. \nThe General Partner will be the sole general partner of KUE and will hold approximately 1,000 General \nPartner Units (\"GP Units\") in KUE, representing approximately 0.04% ownership in KUE. \nThe economic interest in KUE represented by the Common LP Units and the GP Units will be reduced by \nthe Profits Participation LP Units as described below under \"Distributions.\" \nAssuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by March 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends \non the preferred limited partner units are paid in cash, KUE LLC, controlled by the Principals, will hold \napproximately 1,530,000 Common LP Units representing approximately 60% ownership in KUE and \n1,530,000 Class A Shares. The Common LP Units owned by KUE LLC will not be transferable, except (i) \nto the Principals; (ii) to affiliates of the Principals and/or (Hi) to family members and/or charitable \norganizations in connection with the Principals' estate planning unless combined with the corresponding \npercentage of Class A Shares to form Units and transferred in the form of Units in accordance with the \nLimited Partnership Agreement. \nKnowledge Universe Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"KUH LLC\") controlled by the \nPrincipals, will hold 900 Class B ordinary shares of the General Partner (the \"Class B Shares\"). The \nClass B Shares held by the Principals and their affiliates will not be transferable, except to (i) the \nPrincipals; (ii) to the affiliates of the Principals; and/or (Hi) to family members and/or charitable \norganizations in connection with the Principals' estate planning. The Class B Shares will automatically \nconvert to Class A Shares if the Principals' aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in KUE is less \nthan 15% of the outstanding Partnership Units (as defined below) of KUE. \nA limited liability company (\"KULG LLC-1\"), of which Knowledge Universe Learning Group LLC, a \nDelaware limited liability company that is controlled by the Principals (\"KULG\"), and certain other persons \n116 \n\fdesignated by KULG are members, will be the holder of the Profits Participation LP Units (the \"Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner\") with the economic rights as set forth in \"— Distributions\" below. KULG LLC-\n1 will undertake that no more than 9% of the KUE Partnership Interests outstanding immediately after the \nfinal closing of the offering or thereafter will be held directly or indirectly by or for the account of the \nPrincipals and their Affiliates through the Profits Participation LP Units of KUE. At least 2/11ths of the \nProfits Participation LP Units outstanding will be issued to or reserved for the benefit of members of \nKULG LLC-1 that are not the Principals or their affiliates, and may include employees, officers, directors, \nconsultants and agents of KUE, its subsidiaries and joint ventures as designated by KULG. At each \nclosing of any sale of Units to Investors where the aggregate purchase price of all Units acquired by \nInvestors to date is less than or equal to $1.5 billion (during the Offering Period or thereafter), the Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner will be issued a number of Profits Participation LP Units such that the \naggregate shall equal at least 9/11ths of the 11% of \"Partnership Units\" (Common LP Units, GP Units, \nand Profits Participation LP Units) that may be represented by Profits Participation LP Units. Additional \nProfits Participation LP Units will be issued to the Profits Participation Limited Partner, at such time and in \nsuch numbers as the Profits Participation Limited Partner will direct, based upon the issuance by the \nProfit Participation Limited Partner of interests to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner \n(who may include employees, officers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its subsidiaries and joint \nventures as designated by KULG other than the Principals and their affiliates), the vesting schedule of \nsuch interests, and whether certain tax elections are made by the recipients of such interests; provided, \nhowever, the total number of Profits Participation LP Units shall not exceed a number equal to eleven \npercent (11%) of the aggregate number of Partnership Units. Any increase in the number of Profits \nParticipation LP Units following the sale of the first $1.5 billion of Common LP Units to Investors requires \na majority vote of the Independent Committee. \nSubsequent to the completion of this offering, KUE may raise additional capital through the sale of equity \nor debt securities. KUE will not have any preferred limited partner units outstanding upon completion of \nthis offering but KUE may issue limited partner units with preferences over the Common LP Units in the \nfuture and may amend the Limited Partnership Agreement accordingly. \nSince the General Partner will have a nominal economic interest in KUE, the Class A Shares are \nexpected to have nominal economic value. The Class A Shares are, however, intended to provide Unit \nholders with certain voting and other governance rights in the General Partner (as described further below) \nwhich, in turn, will control KUE. \n14.4. Admission of Partners to KUE \nThe General Partner may admit one or more Persons as additional Partners of KUE on such terms as the \nGeneral Partner will determine. Upon the admission of additional Partners, the capital accounts of the \nPartners will be increased or decreased, as the case may be, to reflect the gross asset values of KUE's \nassets pursuant to Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g). The amount of any such increase or decrease \nwill be allocated among the Partners who were Partners immediately prior to the admission of additional \nPartners as if such increase or decrease constituted income or loss, respectively, in accordance with the \nallocation provisions of the Limited Partnership Agreement. \nNot in limitation of the foregoing, Investors admitted during the Offering Period after the first closing of this \noffering and after September 30, 2006 will pay an additional amount accruing at a rate of 0.67% per \nmonth calculated from the first closing date of the offering (pro-rated for partial periods) for each Common \nLP Units purchased, which will be distributed promptly to the holders of Common LP Units outstanding \nprior to such admission in proportion to the number of Common LP Units held by such holders. \n117 \n\f14.5. Management of KUE and the General Partner; Voting Rights \nThe General Partner will manage and operate KUE. Investors will have no voting rights on matters \naffecting KUE business with respect to their Common LP Units in KUE because the Investors will be \nlimited partners of KUE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the \nparagraph below, KUE must obtain the consent of (a) the holders of a majority of the Common LP Units \nunaffiliated with the Principals to amend the Limited Partnership Agreement in a manner that is adverse \nto the Common LP Unit holders and (b) the holders of at least 90% of the Common LP Units unaffiliated \nwith the Principals to amend the \"Equal Merger Consideration Provision\" described herein. In addition, \nthe General Partner may not take any action to (a) alter or add to its Articles or (b) alter or add to its \nMemorandum with respect to any objects, powers or other matters specified therein that would adversely \naffect the rights of holders of Class A Shares without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of \nthe Class A Shares. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner, acting reasonably and in good faith, may amend the \nLimited Partnership Agreement without the consent of any Limited Partner (a) to correct any \ntypographical or similar ministerial errors; (b) to delete or add any provision required to be so deleted or \nadded by applicable law or any government official having jurisdiction over KUE; (c) to cure any mistake \nor ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other \nprovision herein; (d) to take such actions as may be necessary Cif any) to ensure that KUE will be treated \nas a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (e) to reflect the admission of any additional \nLimited Partner and otherwise to reflect such admission or an additional investment by a Limited Partner \non the books and records of KUE pursuant to the General Partner's power of attorney; (f) to take such \nactions as may be necessary (if any) to ensure that neither of KUE or the General Partner (or any \nsubsidiary of the foregoing) will be subject to regulation under ERISA or the Investment Company Act; (g) \nto take such actions as may be necessary (if any) to ensure that the General Partner (or any Subsidiary) \nwill not be subject to the Investment Advisers Act; (h) to reflect any increase in the number of Profits \nParticipation LP Units approved by the Independent Committee and related changes in allocation and \ndistribution provision; CO to make changes negotiated with Limited Partners admitted in any subsequent \nclosing of the offering, so long as such changes do not, in the good faith determination of the General \nPartner and with the approval of the Independent Committee, adversely affect the rights, obligations and \neconomic interests of the existing Limited Partners; and (j) to the extent necessary to give effect to \npartnership interests issued to additional Limited Partners after the Offering Period. The General Partner \nshall provide prompt written notice of any such amendments to the Limited Partners. \nHolders of Class A Shares of the General Partner will have one vote per share. The holders of Class B \nShares will have, in the aggregate, one more vote than the requisite legal vote required to approve \nparticular matters. In addition, Investors will have the right to elect directors to the Board of Directors of \nthe General Partner as set forth in \"— Board of Directors of the General Partner' below. \n14.6. Board of Directors of the General Partner \nThe General Partner will have a Board of Directors initially consisting of up to 13 persons. \nFollowing the first closing of the offering and prior to the \"Initial Listing\" (as defined below), the outside \nInvestor (including its affiliates) holding the greatest number of shares in the General Partner at the first \nclosing of the offering will appoint two directors of the General Partner and the holders of the Class B \nShares will appoint the remaining Directors. \nFollowing the initial appointment of the Board, the Board may, in its sole discretion, increase the number \nof directors, including to accommodate investors that invest subsequent to the initial closing of the \noffering of the Units, provided that the outside Investor appointing two directors pursuant to the paragraph \nabove shall have the right to appoint additional directors as required to maintain a ratio of such Investors \ndesignees to total Board members of not less than 2/15ths. \n118 \n\f\"Independent Directors\" of the Board of Directors of the General Partner shall be individuals who (a) are \nnot (i) a Principal, (ii) a family member of a Principal, (iii) an employee of a Principal or any entity \ncontrolled by one or more of the Principals, and (b) meet the definition of \"independent director\" set forth \nin Rule 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (as if the General Partner, \nKUE and each of its Subsidiaries were the \"listed company\") , including any such individuals appointed by \nthe Investors who otherwise satisfy the requirements of this definition. \nAt the time of the final closing of this offering, the General Partner will have at least two Independent \nDirectors. After the Initial Listing and so long as consistent with contractual, listing and licensing \nobligations, a majority of the board of directors of the listed company will be Independent Directors. \n14.7. Initial Listing; Initial Listing Process \n\"Initial Listing\" means a listing on a recognized international securities exchange with a substantially \nconcurrent underwritten offering generating gross proceeds of U.S. $200 million or more. \"Initial Listing\" \nrefers to the Initial Listing of KUE or any successor or any subsidiary of KUE to which substantially all of \nKUE's assets and liabilities have been transferred or are held. \nThe General Partner may take and cause KUE to take such actions as the General Partner reasonably \ndeems necessary to complete the Initial Listing on the recognized international securities exchange or \nexchanges selected by the General Partner, including without limitation a restructuring or reorganization \nor other transaction or asset transfer between or among KUE and any of its subsidiaries. If the Initial \nListing involves the listing of shares or other interests of a subsidiary of KUE, in the General Partner's \ndiscretion, KUE may (i) retain some or all of KUE's interest in such subsidiary not sold in connection with \nthe Initial Listing, (ii) distribute some or all of KUE's interest in such subsidiary not sold in connection with \nthe Initial Listing to the Partners, (iii) offer Partners the opportunity to exchange their Common LP Units \nand shares of the General Partner for interests in such subsidiary, (iv) require Partners to exchange their \nCommon LP Units and shares of the General Partner for interests in such subsidiary, or (v) any \ncombination of the foregoing. Each Partner shall cooperate with the General Partner in connection with \nthe foregoing, including, without limitation, (i) by providing any necessary approvals from such Partner for \n(a) any merger or consolidation of KUE or a subsidiary then permitted by law into an entity that is eligible \nto effect such Initial Listing and has no other material business, assets or liabilities, or (b) a transfer of all, \nsubstantially all or a portion of the assets and liabilities of KUE to one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries \neligible to effect the Initial Listing; (ii) by exchanging such Partner's Common LP Units and shares of the \nGeneral Partner for shares or other interests of the entity to be listed: Op by agreeing to customary \"lock-\nup\" (on terms no more restrictive than KUE LLC or its affiliates or any other Common Limited Partner \nwhich provides a \"lock-up\") and other agreements with underwriters; and (iv) by taking such other actions \nas may be reasonably requested by the General Partner, provided that, in connection with such Initial \nListing, no Partner shall be required to contribute additional capital to KUE or the entity effecting the Initial \nListing. The economic interests of the Profits Participation Limited Partner shall not be reduced as a result \nof any actions taken to effect the Initial Listing. \n14.8. Mandatory Conversion of Class B Ordinary Shares \nThe Class B Shares will automatically convert to Class A Shares if the Principals' aggregate economic \ninterest in KUE is less than 15% of the outstanding Partnership Units. \n14.9. Distributions \nCash and other property may be distributed from KUE after payment of ordinary expenses and all \namounts currently due on KUE indebtedness, funding capital expenditures of subsidiaries and joint \nventure, funding operating and other expenses of KUE, its subsidiaries and joint ventures and after the \n119 \n\festablishment of reasonably necessary reserves as determined by the General Partner. The General \nPartner will make distributions at such times as determined by the General Partner. \nDistributions will be made in the following priority: \n• First, to the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner in proportion to and to the extent \nof their unreturned capital contributions, but in no case may a distribution pursuant to this bullet \nexceed a Partner's positive adjusted capital account balance; \n• Second, pursuant to Subsections (a) and (b) in proportion as follows: (a) to the Common Limited \nPartners and the General Partner in proportion to and to the extent of their undistributed \nPreferred Returns; and (b) to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in an amount equal to (i) the \nnumber of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, divided by the number of all \noutstanding Units other than Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, multiplied by \n(H) the amount distributed pursuant to Subsection (a) of this bullet, multiplied by (Hi) a fraction to \nbe provided by the Profits Participation Limited Partner; provided, however, that the fraction shall \nnot exceed 2/11ths (unless the Independent Committee has increased the number of Profits \nParticipation LP Units beyond the number initially authorized, in which case the maximum fraction \nauthorized for this purpose would be increased appropriately); \n• Third, to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in an amount equal to: (a) the number of Units \nheld by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, divided by the number of all outstanding Units \nother than Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, multiplied by (b) the amount \ndistributed pursuant to Subsection (a) of the above bullet from the inception of KUE, multiplied by \n(c) a number (expressed as a fraction) equal to 1 minus the fraction used in clause (iii) of the prior \nbullet for the same distribution (unless the Independent Committee has increased the number of \nProfits Participation LP Units beyond the number initially authorized, in which case the maximum \nfraction for this purpose would be modified appropriately), less (d) all amounts previously \ndistributed to the Profits Participation Limited Partner pursuant to this bullet; and \n• Fourth, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits Participation Limited Partner, and the \nGeneral Partner in proportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner. \n\"Preferred Return\" means (as to a Common Limited Partner and the General Partner) an amount equal to \neight percent (8%) per annum, determined on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, \nfor the actual number of days in the period for which the Preferred Return is being determined and be \ncumulative on the capital contributions of such Partners and shall be calculated from the date of such \nPartner's capital contribution; provided however that in the case of Common LP Units issued upon the \nconversion of preferred limited partner units at the initial closing of the offering, that the date of Capital \nContribution shall be deemed to be the date of the initial closing of the offering solely for purposes of \ncalculating the Preferred Return. \nTo the extent, at the time of any distribution or income or loss allocation pursuant to the Partnership \nAgreement, the 2/11ths portion of the Profits Participation LP Units has not then been fully allocated by \nKULG LLC-1 to employees, officers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint \nventures, then the distribution or income or loss allocation that would otherwise be attributable to such \nunallocated portion of the Profits Participation LP Units shall be reallocated among the Common Limited \nPartners and the General Partner in proportion to their Units for purposes of such distribution or income \nor loss allocation (including in connection with their Preferred Return). \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Limited Partnership Agreement gives the General Partner the authority \nto override the distribution provisions of the Limitation Partnership Agreement described above in order to \nachieve the desired economic arrangement of KUE, which is: (i) first, to return the Partners' Capital \nContributions to them; (H) second, for the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner to receive \ntheir Preferred Return while the Profits Participation Limited Partner concurrently receives an amount \nequal to a fraction of the amount the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received \n120 \n\fpursuant to their Preferred Return (such fraction to be equal to the portion of the Units held by the Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner attributable to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner other \nthan the Principals), multiplied by the number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner \ndivided by the number of outstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited \nPartner; (Hi) third, for the Profits Participation Limited Partner to receive an amount equal to a fraction of \nthe amount the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received pursuant to their Preferred \nReturn (such fraction to be equal to the portion of the Units held by the Profits Participation Limited \nPartner attributable to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner who are Principals or their \naffiliates), multiplied by the number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner divided by the \nnumber of outstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner; and \n(iv) finally, for all Partners (including the Profits Participation Limited Partner) to share in the profits of the \nPartnership in proportion to the number of Units held by them. \nThe General Partner may, in its discretion, when establishing the capital structure of subsidiaries or joint \nventures, provide for a capital structure which provides for high-vote and low-vote (or non-voting) \nsecurities with substantially equivalent economic rights intended to correspond to the voting and \neconomic structure of KUE (taking into account differences in legal form, such that corporate subsidiaries \ndo not have specified distribution or liquidation rights with respect to common stock). Notwithstanding \nany contrary provisions below addressing equal merger consideration, to the extent securities of an entity \ncorresponding to the voting structure of KUE are to be distributed to the Partners, the high-vote securities \nshall be distributed to KUE LLC for purposes of maintaining the voting structure subsequent to such \ndistribution, as long as the securities otherwise have substantially equivalent economic rights and the \nhigh-vote securities have mandatory conversion features equivalent to the mandatory conversion features \nof the Class B Shares of the General Partner (as discussed below), it being understood that securities \nwith high-voting rights shall not be deemed to have a higher economic value than securities with limited or \nno voting rights solely by reason of the disparity in voting rights. \n14.10. Allocations of Income and Losses \nIn general (and subject to certain special tax and regulatory allocations), income and gains of KUE will be \nallocated to the Partners in the following priority: \n• First, to the General Partner in an amount equal to the losses previously allocated to the General \nPartner pursuant to the third bullet in the losses allocation from the inception of KUE, less all \nincome previously allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this bullet; \n• Second, to the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner in proportion to and to the \nextent of the excess of their unreturned capital contributions over their adjusted capital account \nbalances; \n• Third, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) in proportion as follows: (a) to the Common Limited \nPartners and the General Partner in proportion to and to the extent of the excess of: (i) the sum of \ntheir unreturned capital contributions and their undistributed Preferred Returns; over (i) their \nadjusted capital account balances; and (b) to the Profits Participation Limited Partner an amount \nof income such that the amount of Income allocated pursuant to Subsections (a) and (b) of this \nbullet are in the same proportions as the distributions pursuant to Subsections (a) and (b) of the \nsecond bullet of 14.9 above would be in if cash, in the same amount as the income, were being \ndistributed pursuant to the second bullet of 14.9 above; \n• Fourth, to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in the amount necessary to ensure, as \npromptly as possible and to the extent feasible, that the cumulative net income of KUE for all \nperiods since its inception shall have been allocated to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner, and the General Partner in proportion to the number of Units held \nby each such Partner; and \n121 \n\f• Fifth, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits Participation Limited Partner, and the General \nPartner in proportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner. \nIn general (and subject to certain special tax and regulatory allocations), losses and deductions of KUE \nwill be allocated to the Partners in the following priority: \n• First, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits Participation Limited Partner, and the General \nPartner in proportion to and to the extent of their positive adjusted capital account balances; \n• Second, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits Participation Limited Partner, and the \nGeneral Partner in proportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner; and \n• Third, to the General Partner. \nTo the extent, at the time of any distribution or income or loss allocation pursuant to the Partnership \nAgreement, the 2/11ths portion of the Profits Participation LP Units has not then been fully allocated by \nKULG LLC-1 to employees, officers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint \nventures, then the distribution or income or loss allocation that would otherwise be attributable to such \nunallocated portion of the Profits Participation LP Units shall be reallocated among the Common Limited \nPartners and the General Partner in proportion to their Units for purposes of such distribution or income \nor loss allocation (including in connection with their Preferred Return). \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Limited Partnership Agreement gives the General Partner the authority \nto override the distribution provisions of the Limitation Partnership Agreement described above in order to \nachieve the desired economic arrangement of KUE, which is: (i) first, to return the Partners' Capital \nContributions to them; (ii) second, for the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner to receive \ntheir Preferred Return while the Profits Participation Limited Partner concurrently receives an amount \nequal to a fraction of the amount the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received \npursuant to their Preferred Return (such fraction to be equal to the portion of the Units held by the Profits \nParticipation Limited Partner attributable to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner other \nthan the Principals), multiplied by the number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner \ndivided by the number of outstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited \nPartner; (Hi) third, for the Profits Participation Limited Partner to receive an amount equal to a fraction of \nthe amount the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received pursuant to their Preferred \nReturn (such fraction to be equal to the portion of the Units held by the Profits Participation Limited \nPartner attributable to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner who are Principals), multiplied \nby the number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner divided by the number of \noutstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner; and (iv) finally, \nfor all Partners (including the Profits Participation Limited Partner) to share in the profits of the \nPartnership in proportion to the number of Units held by them. \n14.11. Tax Distributions \nThe General Partner may decide to make a tax distribution from KUE on or before April 1st of any year \nfollowing a taxable year in which net taxable income was allocated to any Partner. If the General Partner \ndecides to make a tax distribution, then KUE will distribute cash available for distribution, if any, to those \nPartners receiving an allocation of net taxable income, regardless of whether such net taxable income is \nactually subject to tax. The amount of net taxable income upon which such a tax distribution will be made \nwill be based on cumulative calculation of net taxable income and net taxable loss which have been \nallocated to each such Partner from the inception of KUE. Any tax distributions received by a Partner will \nbe treated as an advance and will offset against any other distributions such Partner is entitled to receive \nfrom KUE. \n122 \n\fCertain Partners contributed appreciated property to KUE in exchange for their interests in KUE. Under \nthe Limited Partnership Agreement, and in accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury \nregulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any property contributed to KUE \nmust be allocated for tax purposes among the Partners in a manner that takes into account the variation \nbetween the adjusted basis of such property to KUE and its fair market value at the time the property was \ncontributed to KUE. As a result of this requirement, it is possible the Partners who contributed \nappreciated property to KUE will be allocated more income and gains, and therefore be entitled to receive \nlarger tax distributions under the Limited Partnership Agreement, than Partners who acquired their \ninterests in KUE pursuant to this offering. \n14.12. Fixed Overhead Payment \nKUE, and/or one or more of its subsidiaries will pay $20 million annually to KULG in quarterly installments \nbeginning July 1, 2006 pursuant to the Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement as an agreed upon payment \nto provide for the reimbursement of expenses and other costs incurred by KULG on behalf of KUE and its \nsubsidiaries (including, but not limited to, salaries and bonuses of KULG employees providing services to \nKUE and its subsidiaries, fees and expenses relating to financing transactions and acquisitions, \nprofessional fees and other administrative expenses). To the extent that the U.S. $2,500,000 fee payable \npursuant to an existing management services agreement with Knowledge Learning Corporation is paid to \nany person or entity other than a subsidiary of KUE, the amount payable to KULG by KUE will be reduced \nby the amount of such payment to such other person or entity. The $20 million annual fee will terminate \nupon the Initial Listing or the sale of KUE to a person or entity that is not a KUE LLC Entity. \n14.13. Illiquidity Period \nKUE will operate for a period of seven years from the date of the first closing of this offering. If there has \nnot been an Initial Listing by the end of seven years from the date of the first closing of this offering, the \nBoard of Directors of the General Partner will determine whether to pursue a sale of KUE or an Initial \nListing (or a dual track process); provided, however, in the event that not less than 75% of the value of \nKUE at that time is represented by shares of securities listed on one or more recognized international \nsecurities exchanges and such shares have been or will be distributed as soon as reasonably practicable \nthereafter to the Investors and the Investors have received distributions of cash and/or such securities \nvalued at amounts equal to or in excess of their original capital contributions, then there will be two \nextensions of one year's duration each (as determined by the Board of Directors of the General Partner) \nin order for KUE to complete either an Initial Listing or to have the remaining value of KUE represented by \nshares of securities listed on a recognized international securities exchange and to distribute such shares \nto the Investors. \nIf the Board determines to pursue a sale of KUE (or an Initial Listing or a dual track process), then the \nPrincipals must determine at such time whether they intend to participate as a potential bidder in the sale \nprocess. \nIf the Principals elect not to participate as a potential bidder in a sale process, then they will not be \nallowed to subsequently elect to participate as a potential bidder unless the sale process does not result \nin a buyer at a price the Independent Committee deems to be \"fair.\" If the sale process results in a \ntransaction that the Independent Committee deems to be \"fair\", the Principals will be required to sell their \nentire stake in KUE (Common LP Units and Profits Participation LP Units on an \"as converted\" basis) on \nthe same terms as the Investors. \nIf the Principals elect to participate as a potential bidder in a sale process, then the sale process will be \nmanaged by the Independent Committee and the Principals will be precluded from participating in Board \ndeliberations regarding the sale process. In addition, the Principals will be required to sell their entire \nstake in KUE on the same terms as the Investors to the winning bidder in the event the Principals do not \nsubmit the most attractive bid. \n123 \n\fIn the event that a sale of KUE or an Initial Listing has not occurred within nine years from the date the \nfirst Investors are admitted to KUE, the Independent Committee shall determine whether to pursue a sale \nof KUE (or an Initial Listing or a dual track process). A majority vote of the Independent Committee on \nthis issue shall be binding on the Board of Directors of the General Partner and will require the Board of \nDirectors of the General Partner to pursue such action within ninety (90) days. \n14.14. Equal Merger Consideration Provision \nThe Principals (through KUE LLC) and the Investors will receive the same consideration per Common LP \nUnit and/or Class A/Class B Shares in connection with a sale, merger, recapitalization, share repurchase, \ndividend, or any other transaction where all holders of Common LP Units or shares in the General Partner \nreceive consideration with respect to their Common LP Units or shares, other than with respect to \ncorporate restructuring transactions, such as a holding company merger, conversion of KUE from an \nexempted limited partnership to a corporation or other entity, change of domicile, or any other transaction \nthat the Independent Committee determines is a \"corporate restructuring.\" In any such corporate \nrestructuring transaction, the Principals (through KUE LLC) may receive securities with high-voting rights \nand the Investors may receive securities with limited or no voting rights so long as the consideration \nreceived by the Principals (through KUE LLC) and the other Partners per Common LP Unit have \nsubstantially equivalent economic provisions, it being understood that securities with high-voting rights \nshall not be deemed to have a higher economic value than securities with limited or no voting rights solely \nby reason of the disparity in voting rights. \n14.15. Related Party Transactions \nRelated party transactions include transactions between (1) any of the Principals or any affiliates or any \nentity controlled by any of the Principals, and (2) KUE or any direct or indirect subsidiary or joint venture \nof KUE involving more than $1 million (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any merger, acquisition, \nasset purchase or similar transaction between KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures, on the one hand, \nand any person of which fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting stock (or similar voting interests) is \nowned by KUE LLC or its affiliates, on the other hand). Related party transactions do not include (a) any \ntransaction solely between or among KUE and any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or joint ventures in \nwhich the Principals do not have any direct or indirect ownership interest (other than as a result of their \nownership in the General Partner and KUE), (b) reasonable and customary director, advisory board \nmember, or consultant compensation and benefits (including, without limitation, retirement, health, stock \noption and other benefit plans) as approved by the Independent Committee, provided that any such \ncompensation, benefits and arrangements to the Principals that do not exceed $1 million in the aggregate \nannually shall not be subject to such approval and customary indemnification arrangements, (c) \ntransactions and arrangements pursuant to or contemplated by express terms of the Limited Partnership \nAgreement of KUE, including the \"Investment in Subsidiaries\" and \"Co-Invest Right' described below, and \nany payments pursuant thereto, (d) agreements, transactions and arrangements described in \"Related \nParty Transactions\" in this Private Placement Memorandum (including any indemnification arrangements, \nthe Fixed Overhead Payment described above and other arrangements and transactions described \ntherein) and any amendment thereto (so long as such amendment is not disadvantageous to the \nInvestors as a whole in any material respect) or any transaction contemplated thereby and any payments \npursuant thereto, and (e) admissions of any affiliate of the Principals to KUE as a Limited Partner on \nterms substantially equivalent to concurrent admissions of persons that are not affiliates of the Principals. \nIf the size of the related party transaction is greater than $1 million and equal to or less than $50 million, \nthen either (a) the Independent Committee must approve the transaction or (b) the transaction must be \napproved by the holders of a majority of the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the Principals. \nIf the size of the related party transaction is greater than $50 million, then the transaction must be \napproved by both (a) the Independent Committee and (b) the holders of a majority of the Common LP \nUnits unaffiliated with the Principals. \n124 \n\f14.16. Investment in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures \nThe Principals will agree (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) that KUE will be their exclusive \nvehicle for equity investment opportunities in and acquisitions of for-profit companies engaged primarily in \nthe business of pre-K through 12th grade education of children (other than companies in which the \nPrincipals or their affiliates directly or indirectly owns fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting stock (or \nsimilar voting interests) as of the date of the first closing of the offering, which are LeapFrog Enterprises, \nInc. and Nobel Learning Communities, Inc.). The Principals will not acquire or make an equity investment \nin such companies unless such acquisition or investment opportunity has been first presented to the \nIndependent Committee and subsequently declined by the Independent Committee or initially pursued but \nlater abandoned by KUE. For purposes of the foregoing limitation on investment, an equity investment \nshall not include equity securities that are (a) issued in respect of debt securities in connection with a \nrestructuring, reorganization, sale or other similar transaction in respect of a company; (b) issued in \nconnection with an exchange offer for debt securities; or (c) indirectly owned through a fund or other \ninvestment vehicle managed by a person other than any Principal or affiliate of a Principal. The Principals \nmay co-invest with KUE in such companies, subject to the approval of the Independent Committee and \nthe co-investment rights of Investors in the Limited Partnership Agreement. \nNot in limitation of any commitments or restrictions the Principals may have entered into, prior to an Initial \nListing, KUE may not permit any of its subsidiaries or controlled joint ventures (which shall not include, for \nthe avoidance of doubt, certain exempt companies contemplated by the above paragraph) to issue or \ngrant any equity interests in such subsidiaries or controlled joint ventures to any of the Principals or any of \ntheir affiliates (other than KUE, its subsidiaries and controlled joint ventures) unless (i) the Independent \nCommittee has approved and the Investors who are accredited investors (as such term is defined in \nRegulation D) or otherwise legally eligible to participate are offered the opportunity to participate on the \nsame terms as the Principals and their affiliates and in proportion to their economic ownership of KUE or \n(ii) such subsidiary or joint venture of KUE has completed an initial listing on a recognized international \nsecurities exchange. The foregoing restrictions will not apply to the Principals and/or their affiliates: (a) \nexercising co-investment, purchase or other similar rights in respect of securities of K12 Inc. (including \nwarrants and options) held by them on the first closing of this offering and in respect of securities of K12 \nInc. acquired pursuant to co-investment, purchase or other similar rights exercised in accordance with this \nclause (a); (b) receiving securities of K12 Inc. (including warrants and options) as compensation for \nservices in their capacity as directors (or advisory board members) of K12 Inc.; or (c) exercising or \nconverting any warrants or options (or other securities) held as of the first closing of this offering or \nacquired pursuant to clause (a) or (b). \nThe General Partner may offer co-investment opportunities to any person (except for the Principals and \ntheir affiliates other than KUE's subsidiaries and joint ventures) to invest with KUE or to invest in a \nsubsidiary or joint venture of KUE. \n14.17. Transferability \nThe Common LP Units and the Class A Shares comprising the Units owned by the Investors will not be \nseparately transferable, and the Units are to be transferred as a whole unless otherwise approved by the \nBoard of Directors of the General Partner and the Independent Committee. \nUnits held by an Investor may not be sold, transferred or assigned without the prior written consent of the \nGeneral Partner, not to be unreasonably withheld. During the first two years after the applicable closing \nof the offering, the General Partner intends to approve transfers of Units to an affiliate of the Investor in \ncompliance with applicable law. After such time, the General Partner intends to approve transfers of the \nUnits to an affiliate of the Investor or to another Investor (and affiliates thereof), in each case in \ncompliance with applicable law. The General Partner also intends to approve transfers pursuant to the \nTag-Along Right and Drag-Along Right provisions described below. \n125 \n\fAlthough the Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE and the organizational documents of the General \nPartner permit the foregoing transfers and the General Partner has agreed with certain investors to \napprove such transfers, applicable Caymans Island law gives the General Partner full discretion to \napprove or disapprove transfers of Units in KUE. Nevertheless, if the General Partner does not approve a \npermitted transfer, the parties seeking to effect such transfer may have a claim against the General \nPartner and KUE. \n14.18. Co-Invest Right \nPrior to the Initial Listing, if KUE proposes to issue for cash any Units or securities convertible into Units, \nthen KUE is required to offer to each Investor that is an accredited investor (as such term is defined in \nRegulation D) or is otherwise legally eligible to participate in the offering the right to purchase a pro rata \nportion of such securities. This purchase right does not apply to (i) the first 1.5 million Units (including \nsuch number of Units issued at the first closing of this offering) issued by KUE to Investors through March \n31, 2007, (ii) any public offering of Units or other securities by KUE; (iii) any issuance of Units in \nconnection with a merger, consolidation, transfer of assets or other business combination involving KUE \n(or its subsidiaries or joint ventures); (iv) any issuance of Units pursuant to any unit option plan, restricted \nunit plan or other benefit plan, the terms of which are approved by the General Partner, provided that the \naggregate amount of all Units issued pursuant to this clause (iv) (which does not include any Profits \nParticipation LP Units) shall not exceed 10% of all Units outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date of \nsuch issuance without the approval of the Independent Committee and shall in no event exceed 20% of \nall Units outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date of such issuance; (v) any issuance of Units in \nconnection with any loan transaction and/or equipment lease, the terms of which are approved by the \nGeneral Partner; (vi) any issuance of Units pursuant to any transactions, the terms of which are approved \nby the General Partner primarily for the purpose of (a) joint ventures or strategic alliances, (b) \ndevelopment, production or distribution of the products or services of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint \nventures, (c) purchase or licensing of technology, or (d) any other transactions that are primarily for \npurposes other than raising capital, or (vii) any issuance of Units upon conversion or exercise of any Units \nissued in compliance with this co-invest right provision; or (viii) any issuance of Units in connection with \nUnit splits or Unit dividends or reclassifications. \nPrior to the Initial Listing, Investors have substantially equivalent rights with respect to issuances of \nsecurities by the General Partner (with the additional exemption on the issuance of up to 10,000 \nadditional Class B Shares to the Principals or any of their Affiliates). \n14.19. Tag-Along Right \nA \"Tag-Along Transfer\" means a sale or other transfer for economic value of the Common LP Units held \nby KUE LLC and its affiliates (and, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors and the \nIndependent Committee of the General Partner, a corresponding percentage of Class A Shares held by \nKUE LLC) to a Person that is not KUE LLC or an affiliate (\"KUE LLC Entity\"). \nUnless an Initial Listing occurred, a Tag-Along Transfer may not be consummated unless the proposed \npurchaser offers to each Investor the opportunity to include a pro rata portion of such Investor's Units in \nthe Tag-Along Transfer (at the same consideration per Unit received by the KUE LLC Entity). If the total \nnumber of Units and corresponding Class A Shares proposed to be sold to the proposed purchaser \nexceeds the number of Units and corresponding Class A Shares which the proposed purchaser is willing \nto purchase, the number of Units and corresponding Class A Shares to be sold will be reduced pro rata \nbased on the total number of Units held by the transferor(s) initiating the Tag-Along Transfer and each \nparticipating Investor. \nFollowing the Initial Listing, the tag-along right will continue for certain Investors with respect to transfers \nfor value of the Units (or units of the listed entity as the case may be) by the Principals or their affiliates to \nnon-affiliates (excluding transfers on a recognized international securities exchange) above the following \n126 \n\fthresholds in one or more transactions: (i) 15% of the Principals' original KUE holdings to any single \nbuyer (or affiliates of that buyer) or (ii) 33% of the Principals' original KUE holdings in the aggregate. \n14.20. Drag-Along Right \nA \"Drag-Along Transfer' means a sale or other transfer for economic value of a majority of the Common \nLP Units held by KUE LLC or its affiliates (and, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors and \nthe Independent Committee of the General Partner, a corresponding percentage of Class A Shares held \nby KUE LLC). Prior to the Initial Listing, in the event of a Drag-Along Transfer of Common LP Units and \ncorresponding Class A Shares to a proposed purchaser that is not a KUE LLC Entity (a \"Proposed Drag-\nAlong Transfer\"), KUE LLC may require Investors to sell a pro rata portion (based on the percentage of \nUnits held by KUE LLC being sold in the Proposed Drag-Along Transfer) of their Units and Class A \nShares in the Proposed Drag-Along Transfer to the proposed purchaser on the same terms and \nconditions as KUE LLC in the Proposed Drag-Along Transfer. \n14.21. Additional Listing of Investors' Units \nBeginning any time after six months after the Initial Listing, one or more holders holding an aggregate of \n$100 million of more of the Units (calculated based on the issue price) may request KUE and the General \nPartner to take such action as may be necessary (including regulatory and legal actions) for their Units to \nbe freely tradable and not subject to volume restrictions on the international securities exchange on which \nthe Initial Listing occurred; provided that no more than one such action may be required in any 12 month \nperiod and customary cut-back and other provisions will apply in any such listing or underwritten \ntransaction, as the case may be. KUE will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such action to \ncover such holders and the securities of any other holders legally eligible to participate in such action. \n14.22. Subsequent Capital Raising Activities \nSubsequent to the completion of this offering, KUE may raise additional capital through the sale of equity \nor debt securities. KUE will not have any preferred limited partner units outstanding upon completion of \nthis offering but KUE may issue limited partner units with preferences over the Common LP Units in the \nfuture and may amend the Limited Partnership Agreement accordingly. \n14.23. Periodic Reporting; Books and Records \nAs soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year but in no event more than 180 days thereafter, \neach Partner will be sent audited financial statements of KUE for the prior year. These financial \nstatements will include: (i) profit and loss statements and (ii) a balance sheet showing KUE's financial \nposition as of the end of that fiscal year. KUE will also provide to each Partner on a semi-annual basis a \nreport concerning KUE's operations. As soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, each \nPartner will be furnished with all information necessary for the preparation of each Partner's U.S. Federal \nincome tax return and a copy of KUE's federal, state, and local tax or information returns for the year. \nKUE will maintain at its principal place of business full and complete books and records for KUE including \nthe following: (1) a current list of the full name and last known business or residence address of each \nPartner set forth in alphabetical order, together with the capital contribution and share of income and \nlosses of each Partner; (2) a copy of the Statement filed under to Section 9 of the ELP Law and all \namendments thereto; (3) copies of KUE's federal, state, and local income tax returns and reports, if any, \nfor the six most recent taxable years, to the extent that such exist; (4) copies of the Limited Partnership \nAgreement and all amendments thereto; and (5) any other information required to be maintained by the \nELP Law. Upon the request of a Partner, the General Partner will promptly deliver to the requesting \nPartner, at the expense of KUE, a copy of the information listed in the foregoing sentence. \n127 \n\fThe General Partner will provide such periodic reports if engaged in any business other than acting as \nGeneral Partner of KUE or if it owns any material assets other than an interest in KUE. \n14.24. Indemnification \nKUE will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner, and its \nmembers, officers, directors, and employees, and at the General Partner's discretion, any other person \nproviding services to KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures, (Indemnified Persons\") from and against loss \nbecause of any action performed by them on behalf of KUE or of the failure to take any action on behalf of \nKUE, unless such loss resulted from the Indemnified Person acting in bad faith or the willful misconduct, \nfraud or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person, or a material breach of the Limited Partnership \nAgreement by such Indemnified Person. Indemnified persons may receive advances or be reimbursed \nfor their expenses. \n14.25. Amendment of the Limited Partnership Agreement \nGenerally, the Limited Partnership Agreement may be amended with the consent of the General Partner. \nSubject to the exceptions specified in the Limited Partnership Agreement, amendments adversely \naffecting the Common LP Units may not be effected without a majority of the votes represented by Units \nheld by Investors. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner, acting reasonably and in good faith, may amend the \nLimited Partnership Agreement without the consent of any Limited Partner (a) to correct any typographical \nor similar ministerial errors; (b) to delete or add any provision required to be so deleted or added by \napplicable law or any government official having jurisdiction over KUE; (c) to cure any mistake or \nambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other \nprovision herein; (d) to take such actions as may be necessary Cif any) to ensure that KUE will be treated \nas a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (e) to reflect the admission of any additional \nLimited Partner and otherwise to reflect such admission or an additional investment by a Limited Partner \non the books and records of KUE pursuant to the General Partner's power of attorney; (f) to take such \nactions as may be necessary (if any) to ensure that neither of KUE or the General Partner (or any \nsubsidiary of the foregoing) will be subject to regulation under ERISA or the Investment Company Act; (g) \nto take such actions as may be necessary (if any) to ensure that the General Partner (or any Subsidiary) \nwill not be subject to the Investment Advisers Act; (h) to reflect any increase in the number of Profits \nParticipation LP Units approved by the Independent Committee and related changes in allocation and \ndistribution provision; (i) to make changes negotiated with Limited Partners admitted in any subsequent \nclosing of the offering, so long as such changes do not, in the good faith determination of the General \nPartner and with the approval of the Independent Committee, adversely affect the rights, obligations and \neconomic interests of the existing Limited Partners; and a) to the extent necessary to give effect to \npartnership interests issued to additional Limited Partners after the Offering Period. The General Partner \nshall provide prompt written notice of any such amendments to the Limited Partners. \n14.26. Confidentiality \nEach Investor is subject to an obligation to keep KUE related information confidential, subject to limited \nexceptions. KUE or the General Partner will be entitled to enforce such obligations and take such actions \nto maintain the confidentiality of KUE related information, including without limitation withholding any \nperiodic or financial reports (with the approval of the Independent Committee) from an Investor that has \nviolated its confidentiality obligations. \n128 \n\f14.27. Jurisdiction \nAny actions or proceedings under the Limited Partnership Agreement or with respect to the General \nPartners or this offering and the related agreements are subject to binding arbitration in London, United \nKingdom. \n14.28. Limitation of Participation \nUnder circumstances where the continuing participation in KUE by an Investor would have a material \nadverse effect on KUE or a subsidiary, the General Partner may cause an Investor's interest in KUE to be \nredeemed or transferred. \n14.29. United States Trade or Business \nThe General Partner will use its reasonable best efforts not to cause or allow KUE to engage in or invest \n(other than through an entity that is not a pass-through entity) in a pass-through entity (for U.S. federal \nincome tax purposes) that engages in: (i) any commercial activities within the meaning of Section \n892(a)(2) of the Code, or (fi) any activity which constitutes the conduct of a trade or business in the United \nStates and generates income which constitutes \"effectively connected income\" in the hands of a non-U.S. \nLimited Partner. KUE will not take a position in any United States federal or state income tax return that \nKUE is engaged in a trade or business in the United States that causes the non-U.S. Limited Partners to \nhave income which constitutes \"effectively connected income\" in the hands of non-U.S. Limited Partners. \nIn addition, the General Partner will use its reasonable best efforts to cause KUE not to invest in a U.S. \nreal property interest described in Section 897(c)(1 )(A)(i) or the Code. \nThe General Partner may, in its discretion, form a separate investment entity to pursue any investment \nopportunity that is unavailable to KUE by reason of the foregoing, and may offer co-investment \nopportunities to the Partners eligible to participate in such opportunities in proportion to their Units or on \nsuch other reasonable basis as the General Partner may determine. \nEACH PROSPECTIVE NON-U.S. LIMITED PARTNER SHOULD REVIEW THE SECTION ENTITLED \n\"CERTAIN INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES\" AND CONSULT ITS TAX AND OTHER ADVISORS IN \nDETERMINING THE POSSIBLE TAX, EXCHANGE CONTROL OR OTHER CONSEQUENCES TO IT \nUNDER THE LAWS OF THE U.S. AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS OF WHICH IT IS A CITIZEN, \nRESIDENT OR DOMICILIARY, IN WHICH IT CONDUCTS BUSINESS OR IN WHICH IT OTHERWISE \nMAY BE SUBJECT TO TAX, OF THE PURCHASE AND OWNERSHIP OF UNITS. \n14.30.

Upon the winding up and \ntermination of the business and affairs of KUE, its assets (other than cash) will be sold, its liabilities and \nobligations to creditors and all expenses incurred in its liquidation will be paid. The net proceeds from \nsuch sales (after deducting all selling costs and expenses in connection therewith) and any released \nreserves will then be distributed to the Partners in accordance with \"— Distributions\" by the later of the end \nof the taxable year of KUE which includes the liquidation date or the 90th day following the liquidation \ndate.

UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 \nThe Units will not be registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration \nprovided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and will not be registered under the securities laws of any \njurisdiction. \nAccordingly, the Units are initially being offered and sold only to \"accredited investors.\" \nEach investor is required to enter into a Subscription Agreement to purchase the Units. In the \nSubscription Agreement, it will be required to represent, among other customary private placement \nrepresentations, as follows: \n• that it is an \"accredited investor\" (as such term is defined in Regulation D under the Securities \nAct); \n• that it has carefully read and understood this Memorandum and the organizational documents of \nKUE in their entirety and that it has relied on such documents in making its investment decision; \n• that it has had an opportunity to receive answers from KUE to its questions regarding the Units \nand other matters pertaining to its investment, and it has obtained all additional information it has \nrequested from KUE to verify the accuracy of the information furnished to it; \n• that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the Units and of making an \ninformed investment decision with respect thereto; \n• that its financial situation is such that it can afford to bear the economic risk of holding the Units \nas an illiquid investment for an indefinite period of time, and it can afford to suffer the complete \nloss of its investment; \n• that it is acquiring the Units for its own account for investment purposes only and not with a view \nto resale or distribution; and \n• that it understands that it must bear the economic risk of an investment in the Units for an \nindefinite period of time. \nIn the Subscription Agreement, each investor will be required to represent whether or not it is a U.S. \nPerson or non-U.S. Person (as such terms are defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act). Each \nnon-U.S. Person will be required to represent: \n• whether it is purchasing the Units in an offshore transaction within the meaning of Regulation S; \nand \n• that it is eligible to purchase the Units under the laws applicable to it. \n136 \n\fA copy of the form of the Subscription Agreement will be provided. Each investor should carefully read \nthe Subscription Agreement in its entirety so as to fully understand the representations and warranties it is \nrequired to make pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. \nThe Units cannot be resold or otherwise transferred unless they are subsequently registered under the \nSecurities Act and other applicable securities laws, or exemptions from such registration requirements are \navailable. It is not contemplated that registration of the Units under the Securities Act or other securities \nlaws will ever be effected. There is no public market for the Units, and none is expected to develop. \nTherefore, an investor that purchases the Units may be required to hold the Units for an indefinite period \nof time. The Units, if certificated, will bear a legend describing such transfer limitations. \n17.2. United States Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 \nAn investment in the Units and the underlying Common LP Units and Class A Shares by certain U.S. \nemployee benefit plans is subject to additional considerations because the investments of such plans are \nsubject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of the U.S. Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), and restrictions imposed by Section \n4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"IRC\"). For these purposes the term \n\"employee benefit plan\" includes, but is not limited to, qualified pension, profit-sharing and stock bonus \nplans, Keogh plans, simplified employee pension plans and tax deferred annuities or IRAs established or \nmaintained by an employer or employee organization. Among other things, such employee benefit plans \nshould give consideration to: \n• whether the investment is prudent under ERISA. \n• whether in making the investment, that plan will satisfy the diversification requirements of ERISA; \nand \n• whether the investment will result in recognition of unrelated business taxable income by the plan \nand, if so, the potential after-tax investment return. \nThe person with investment discretion with respect to the assets of an employee benefit plan, often called \na fiduciary, should also determine whether an investment in the Units and the underlying Common LP \nUnits and Class A Shares is authorized by the appropriate governing instrument and is a proper \ninvestment for the plan. \nSection 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the IRC also prohibit employee benefit plans, and also IRAs \nthat are not considered part of an employee benefit plan, from engaging in specified transactions \ninvolving \"plan assets\" with parties that are \"parties in interest\" under ERISA or \"disqualified persons\" \nunder the IRC with respect to the plan. \nIn addition to considering whether the purchase of Units and the Common LP Units and Class A Shares is \na prohibited transaction, a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan should consider whether the plan will, by \nmaking such an investment, be deemed to own an undivided interest in the assets of KUE or the General \nPartner, with the result that KUE or the General Partner would be subject to the regulatory restrictions of \nERISA, including its prohibited transaction rules, as well as the prohibited transaction rules of the IRC. \nThe U.S. Department of Labor regulations under ERISA provide guidance with respect to whether the \nassets of an entity in which employee benefit plans acquire equity interests would be deemed \"plan \nassets\" under some circumstances. Under these regulations, an entity's assets would not be considered \nto be \"plan assets\" if, among other things: \n(a) the equity interests acquired by employee benefit plans are publicly offered securities, \ni.e., the equity interests are widely held by 100 or more investors independent of the \n137 \n\fissuer and each other, freely transferable and registered under some provisions of the \nfederal securities laws; \n(b) the entity is an \"operating company,\" meaning it is primarily engaged in the production or \nsale of a product or service other than the investment of capital either directly or through \na majority-owned subsidiary or subsidiaries; or \n(c) the entity is a \"venture capital operating company,\" meaning that at least 50% of its \nassets, determined on certain testing dates, are invested in operating companies with \nrespect to which the entity has contractual management rights which the entity actually \nexercises in the ordinary course of its business; or \n(d) there is no significant investment by benefit plan investors, which is defined to mean that \nless than 25% of the value of each class of equity interest is held by the employee benefit \nplans referred to above, IRAs and other employee benefit plans not subject to ERISA, \nincluding U.S. and non-U.S. governmental plans. \nThe General Partner intends to operate the General Partner and KUE in such fashion that, for purposes \nof the plan asset regulations, the assets of KUE and the General Partner will not be considered assets of \nany plan investing in KUE and the General Partner. The Limited Partnership Agreement (and the \norganizational documents of the General Partner) will confer on the General Partner (and the Principals) \nthe authority to take any action necessary or desirable in order to prevent Company assets and General \nPartner assets from being considered to be plan assets, including the authority to restructure any aspects \nof KUE and the authority to cause the redemption or sale of Units held by some or all plan investors. \nKUE is considering whether and to what extent to permit plan investors to invest in the Units. Due to the \ncomplexity of the applicable rules and the penalties imposed upon persons involved in prohibited \ntransactions, it is particularly important that potential purchasers that are plans consult with their counsel \nregarding the consequences under ERISA of their acquisition and ownership of the Units. Employee \nbenefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) and certain church plans \n(as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) are not subject to ERISA requirements but may be subject to \nanalogous provisions under applicable state, local or non-U.S. law. \n17.3. Anti-Money Laundering — Cayman Islands \nIn order to comply with regulations aimed at the prevention of money laundering in any applicable \njurisdictions, the General Partner and KUE are required to adopt and maintain anti-money laundering \nprocedures, and may require prospective investors to provide evidence to verify their identity. \nAccordingly, the General Partner (and its directors) reserve the right to request such information as they \nconsider necessary to verify the identity of a prospective investor. Where permitted, and subject to \ncertain conditions, the General Partner and KUE may also delegate the maintenance of its anti-money \nlaundering procedures (including the acquisition of due diligence information) to a suitable person. The \nGeneral Partner (and its directors) may refuse to accept any subscription application if a prospective \ninvestor delays in producing or fails to produce any information required by the General Partner (and its \ndirectors) for the purpose of verification and, in that event, any funds received will be returned without \ninterest to the account from which the moneys were originally debited. \nThe General Partner and KUE also reserve the right to refuse to make any redemption payment to a \nshareholder of the General Partner or a partner of KUE, as applicable, if they suspect or are advised that \nthe payment of redemption proceeds to such person might result in a breach of applicable anti-money \nlaundering or other laws or regulations by any person in any relevant jurisdiction, or if such refusal is \nconsidered necessary or appropriate to ensure the compliance by the General Partner and KUE with any \nsuch laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction. \n138 \n\fIf any person resident in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects that another person is engaged in money \nlaundering or is involved with terrorism or terrorist property and the information for that knowledge or \nsuspicion came to their attention in the course of their business the person will be required to report such \nbelief or suspicion to either the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the \nProceeds of Criminal Conduct Law (2005 Revision) if the disclosure relates to money laundering or to a \npolice officer of the rank of constable or higher if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or \nterrorist property, pursuant to the Terrorism Law. Such a report shall not be treated as a breach of \nconfidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or \notherwise. \n17.4. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nThe General Partner, KUE, its subsidiaries and joint ventures intend to comply with applicable provisions \nof the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") in connection with their business activities worldwide. The \nFCPA prohibits corrupt payments to foreign officials, (including any officer or employee of a foreign \ngovernment, a public international organization, or any department or agency thereof, or any person \nacting in an official capacity, regardless of rank or position), parties or candidates to obtain or retain \nbusiness or securing any improper advantage and the FCPA prohibits paying, offering, promising to pay, \ndirectly or indirectly, money or anything of value in connection therewith. \nInvestors will be required to provide information on whether they are foreign officials, and confirm that \nthey have not paid, offered to pay or promised to pay and do not intend to pay, offer to pay or promise to \npay, directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any foreign official, party or candidate to obtain or \nretain business (whether with a government or agency or instrumentality thereof or otherwise) for or on \nbehalf of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures or to secure an improper advantage for KUE or its \nsubsidiaries or joint ventures in any country. \n139 \n\f18. CERTAIN INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES \nThe following summary of the taxation of KUE and the taxation of the Partners of KUE is based \nupon current law and does not purport to be a comprehensive discussion of all the tax \nconsiderations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Units. Legislative, judicial or \nadministrative changes may be forthcoming that could affect this summary. \nTO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS, WE \nADVISE YOU THAT: (i) ANY DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES CONTAINED \nHEREIN IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE RELIED UPON, AND CANNOT BE \nRELIED UPON, BY INVESTORS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING TAX-RELATED \nPENALTIES UNDER THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OR APPLICABLE STATE OR \nLOCAL TAX LAW PROVISIONS; (ii) SUCH DISCUSSION IS BEING USED IN CONNECTION \nWITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING (WITHIN THE MEANING OF TREASURY \nREGULATIONS) BY THE COMPANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS \nADDRESSED HEREIN; (iii) INVESTORS SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THEIR \nPARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR. \nPROSPECTIVE INVESTORS (INCLUDING ALL NON-U.S. PERSONS AS DEFINED BELOW) \nSHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, \nLOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF OWNING COMMON LP UNITS UNDER \nTHE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRIES OF CITIZENSHIP, RESIDENCE, ORDINARY \nRESIDENCE, OR DOMICILE. \n18.1. Cayman Taxation \nThere is, at present, no direct taxation in the Cayman Islands. The Government of the Cayman Islands, \nwill not, under existing legislation, impose any income, corporate or capital gains tax, estate duty, \ninheritance tax, gift tax, or withholding tax upon KUE, its partners, the General Partner, or its \nshareholders. Similarly interest, dividends and gains payable to KUE and all distributions by KUE to its \npartners will be received free of any Cayman Islands income or withholding taxes. \nKUE has registered as an exempted limited partnership under Cayman Islands law and KUE has \nreceived an undertaking from the Governor-in-Cabinet of the Cayman Islands to the effect that, for a \nperiod of 50 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands \nimposing any tax to be levied on profits or income or gains or appreciations shall apply to KUE or to any \npartner of KUE in respect of the operations or assets of KUE or the interest of a partner in KUE; and may \nfurther provide that any such taxes or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be \npayable in respect of the obligations of KUE or the interests of the partners in KUE. \nThe General Partner of KUE has registered as an exempted company under Cayman Islands law and the \nGeneral Partner has received an undertaking from the Governor-in-Cabinet of the Cayman Islands that, in \naccordance with section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a \nperiod of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands \nimposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate \nduty or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on the shares of the General Partner or (fi) by way of the \nwithholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by the \nGeneral Partner to its shareholders. \nThe Cayman Islands does not have a double tax treaty with the United States or any other country. \n140 \n\f18.2. United States Federal Income Taxation \nThe following summary sets forth the material U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the \npurchase, ownership, and disposition of Common LP Units. Unless otherwise stated, this summary deals \nonly with partners that are U.S. Persons (as defined below) who purchase their Common LP Units in this \noffering and who hold their Common LP Units as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the \nCode. The following discussion is only a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax matters as \ndescribed herein and does not purport to address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that \nmay be relevant to a particular Limited Partner of KUE (\"Limited Partner\") in light of such Limited Partner's \nspecific circumstances. In addition, except as expressly stated, the following summary does not address \nthe U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to special classes of Limited Partners \nwho may be subject to special rules or treatment under the Code, such as financial institutions, insurance \ncompanies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, or other pass-\nthrough entities, dealers or traders in securities, tax-exempt organizations, expatriates, any person who \nowns or is deemed to own, for U.S. federal income tax purpose, 10% or more of the total combined voting \npower of all classes of voting stock of the corporate subsidiaries of KUE, persons that have a \"functional \ncurrency\" other than the United States dollar, and any individual who is a non-U.S. Person (as defined \nbelow) and who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in a taxable year. This discussion does not \ninclude any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments within the U.S. No ruling has \nbeen or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed herein. Counsel to KUE has not \nrendered any legal opinion regarding any tax consequences relating to KUE or an investment in KUE. No \nassurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position \ncontrary to any of the positions taken by KUE as set forth below. \nFor purposes of this discussion, the term \"U.S. Person\" means (1) a citizen or resident of the U.S., (2) a \ncorporation created or organized in or under the laws of any State of the U.S. (including the District of \nColumbia), (3) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its \nsource, (4) a trust if either (a) a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the \nadministration of such trust and one or more U.S. Persons have the authority to control all substantial \ndecisions of such trust or (b) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. Person for U.S. \nfederal income tax purposes, or (5) any other person or entity that is treated for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes as if it were one of the foregoing. The term \"non-U.S. Person\" means any person other than a \nU.S. Person. \n18.2.1 United States Federal Income Taxation of KUE and its Subsidiaries \nPartnership Status of KUE. KUE believes that it should be classified as a partnership for United States \nfederal income tax purposes. Accordingly, KUE is not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income \ntax liability. Instead, each Partner will be allocated its share of KUE's income or loss, as the case may be, \nfor United States federal income tax purposes as set forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement. In \naddition, each U.S. Partner's share of income or loss from KUE generally will be required to be includable \nin income for state and local tax purposes in the jurisdiction in which the investor is a resident and in the \njurisdictions in which KUE operates. Each U.S. Partner will be responsible for paying the income tax on \nthat portion of KUE's income allocated to such investor. No assurances can be given that any cash \ndistribution will be made from KUE to the partners to pay such income tax liabilities. \nUnder the Code, certain non-U.S corporations may be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal \nincome tax purposes, thereby subjecting such non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income tax on their \nincome. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation includes one such provision. Under this legislation, \nreferred to as the anti-inversion legislation, non-U.S. corporations that acquire interests in a U.S. \ncorporation or partnership and meet certain ownership, operational and other tests may be treated as U.S. \ncorporations for federal income tax purposes. The legislation grants broad regulatory authority to the U.S. \nSecretary of Treasury to provide such regulations as may be appropriate to determine whether a non-U.S. \ncorporation is treated as a U.S. corporation or as are necessary to carry out the intent of the provision, \nincluding adjusting its application as necessary to prevent the avoidance of its purpose. Recently issued \n141 \n\fTreasury regulations provide that the anti-inversion legislation is applicable to a foreign partnership that is \nor becomes a \"publicly traded partnership\" within two years of the acquisition by it of a U.S. corporation. \nA \"publicly traded partnership\" is any partnership (i) interests in which are traded on an established \nsecurities market, or (ii) interests in which are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial \nequivalent thereof). KUE believes that it is not currently a publicly traded partnership and does not intend \nto become a publicly traded partnership within two years of this offering or the acquisition of KLC and k12. \nAs a result, KUE does not believe the anti-inversion legislation or any regulations promulgated within the \nscope of the legislation's regulatory authority should apply to KUE although no assurance can be given in \nthis regard or with respect to any new acquisitions of or investment in U.S. corporations. In addition, KUE \ndoes not believe that any other Code provision subjecting non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income \ntax should apply to KUE or its subsidiaries, although no assurance can be given in this regards. The \npromulgation of contrary regulations or a successful challenge of either of these positions by the Internal \nRevenue Service could materially reduce a holder's after-tax return and, thus, could result in a substantial \nreduction of the value of the Units. \nThe remainder of this section assumes that KUE will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income \ntax purposes. \n18.2.2 United States Federal Income Taxation of Partners \nU.S. Persons \nAllocation of Purchase Price. You will be treated as purchasing a Unit consisting of two components, one \nCommon LP Unit and one GP Share. Your purchase price for each Unit will be allocated between one \nCommon LP Unit and one GP Share in proportion to their relative fair market values at the time of your \npurchase, and this allocation will establish your initial tax basis in both your ownership interest in the \nCommon LP Unit and your GP Share. We will treat the fair market value of each Common LP Share at \n$999 and the fair market value of each GP Share as $1. \nFlow-Through of Taxable Income. KUE will not pay any U.S. federal income tax. Instead, each Partner \nwill be required to report on its income tax return its allocable share (as determined pursuant to the \nLimited Partnership Agreement) of KUE's income, gains, losses, and deductions without regard to \nwhether corresponding cash distributions are made. The Limited Partnership Agreement authorizes the \nGeneral Partner to override the allocation provisions of the Limited Partnership Agreement and allocate \nincome, gains, losses and deductions of KUE to the Partners in a manner that achieves the desired \neconomic arrangement of KUE, which is to return each Partner's capital contribution and then for all \nPartners (including the holder of Profits Participation LP Units) to share in the profits of KUE in proportion \nto the number of Units held by them. \nThe IRS may challenge the manner in which income, gains, losses and deductions are allocated to \nholders of Common LP Units, the General Partner and holders of the Profits Participation LP Units under \nthe Limited Partnership Agreement. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, allocation of any item of \nincome, gain, loss or deduction to a partner in a partnership will be given effect so long as the allocation \nhas \"substantial economic effect,\" or is otherwise in accordance with the partner's interest in the \npartnership. If an allocation of an item pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement does not satisfy \nthis standard or is deemed not to satisfy this standard by the IRS, it will be reallocated by the IRS among \nthe Partners on the basis of their respective interests in KUE (as determined by the IRS), taking into \naccount all facts and circumstances. In such a case, holders of Common LP Units could have additional \ntax liabilities or suffer adverse tax consequences. \nTreatment of Cash Distributions. KUE's distributions to a Partner generally will not be taxable to the \nPartner for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of such Partner's adjusted tax basis in its \nCommon LP Units immediately before the distribution. Cash distributions in excess of a Limited Partner's \nadjusted tax basis generally will be considered to be gain from the sale or exchange of the Common LP \nUnits. Any reduction in a Limited Partner's share of KUE's liabilities, if any, for which no Partner bears the \n142 \n\feconomic risk of loss, known as \"nonrecourse liabilities,\" will be treated as a deemed distribution of cash \nto that Partner. A decrease in a Partner's percentage interest in KUE because of KUE's issuance of \nadditional limited partner units (\"Limited Partner Units\") would decrease such Partner's share of Company \nnonrecourse liabilities, if any, and thus would result in a corresponding deemed distribution of cash. \nTreatment of In-Kind Distributions. KUE's distribution of property (other than cash) to a Partner generally \nwill not be taxable to the Partner unless the property is a \"marketable security\" and the exceptions to the \nrequirement for recognition of gain upon distributions of marketable securities do not apply. Marketable \nsecurities, for these purposes, include actively traded securities or equity interests in another entity that \nare readily convertible into or exchangeable for cash or other marketable securities. If the distributed \nproperty constitutes a marketable security, the property would be treated as cash and the Partner would \nrecognize gain, but not loss, to the extent described above. \nBasis of Common LP Units. A Limited Partner will have an initial tax basis for its Common LP Units equal \nto the amount it paid for the Common LP Units plus its share of Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any. \nThat basis will be increased by the Limited Partner's share of Company income and by any increases in \nits share of Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any. That basis will be decreased, but not below zero, by \ndistributions from KUE, by the Limited Partner's share of KUE losses, by any decrease in its share of \nCompany nonrecourse liabilities, if any, and by its share of Company expenditures that are not deductible \nin computing KUE's taxable income and are not required to be capitalized. \nLimitations on Deductibility of Company Losses. The deduction by a Limited Partner of its share of \nCompany losses will be limited to the adjusted tax basis in its Common LP Units. Limited Partners should \nbe aware that they could be subject to various other limitations on their ability to deduct their allocable \nshares of Company losses (or items of deductions). Such limitations include, but are not limited to, those \nrelating to \"investment interest\" expense under Section 163(d) of the Code, \"miscellaneous itemized \ndeductions\" under Section 67 of the Code, certain other itemized deductions of high income individuals \nunder Section 68 of the Code, the \"at risk\" rules under Section 465 of the Code, and the deductibility of \ncapital losses under the Code. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the \npotential application of such rules to their particular situation. \nAllocation of Income, Gain, Loss, and Deduction. If KUE has a net profit or net loss, its items of income, \ngain, loss, and deduction will be allocated among the Partners in accordance with the provisions of the \nLimited Partnership Agreement. \nDispositions of Common LP Units — Recognition of Gain or Loss. A Limited Partner will recognize gain or \nloss on a sale of Common LP Units equal to the difference between the amount realized and the Limited \nPartner's adjusted tax basis for the Common LP Units sold. A Limited Partner's amount realized will be \nmeasured by the sum of cash or the fair market value of other property received plus its share of \nCompany nonrecourse liabilities, if any. Generally, gain or loss recognized by a Limited Partner on the \nsale or exchange of Common LP Units will be taxable as capital gain or loss and as long-term capital gain \nor loss if the Common LP Units were held for more than twelve months. \nNon-U.S. Persons \nWithholding. Ownership of Common LP Units by non-U.S. Persons raises special U.S. federal income \ntax considerations. To the extent that KUE receives dividends from a U.S. subsidiary, distributions of \nsuch dividend income to Limited Partners who are non-U.S. Persons will be subject to U.S. withholding at \na rate of 30%. Certain countries have tax treaties with the U.S. that reduce or eliminate the withholding \nrequirement. To the extent that KUE receives dividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary, distributions of such \ndividend income to Limited Partners who are non-U.S. Persons will not be subject to U.S. tax, unless \nsuch income were deemed to be effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by KUE in the \nU.S. KUE will be required to pay withholding tax with respect to the portion of KUE's income that is \n\"effectively connected\" with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and which is allocable to non-U.S. \nPersons. Any amounts KUE is required to remit to taxing authorities will be treated as a distribution to the \nPartner on whose behalf the withholding is being paid and will be charged against current and/or future \n143 \n\fdistributions such Partner would otherwise be entitled to. If KUE is required to withhold on amounts in \nexcess of cash distributions, Partners shall be required to contribute to KUE cash in an amount by which \nsuch required withholding exceeds any such distributions. \nGain on Sale. A Limited Partner that is a non-U.S. Person will be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon \nthe sale or exchange of its Common LP Units to the extent that such Limited Partner recognizes gain \nupon such sale or exchange and such gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. \nU.S. Real Property Holding Corporation. If a direct U.S. subsidiary of KUE is or were to become a \n\"United States Real Property Holding Corporation,\" or \"USRPHC\" (as defined below), certain disposition \nof Common LP Units by a Limited Partner that is a non-U.S. Person would result in such Limited Partner \nbeing subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the portion of the gain recognized on such \ndisposition that is attributable to such subsidiary. In addition, if a direct U.S. subsidiary of KUE is or were \nto become a USRPHC, certain dispositions of such subsidiary by KUE would result in Limited Partners \nwho are non-U.S. Persons being subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of their allocable share of \nthe gain recognized by KUE on such disposition. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market \nvalue of its \"U.S. real property interests\" equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its \nworldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. KUE \nbelieves that each of its direct U.S. subsidiaries is not currently a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes. However, no assurances can be given in this regard. Furthermore, it is possible that in the \nfuture one of KUE's subsidiaries may become a USRPHC if, for example, the value of the U.S. real estate \nholdings of such subsidiary increases sufficiently. Limited Partners that are non-U.S. Persons are urged \nto consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the USRPHC rules to their investment in \nKUE. \nAdministrative Matters \nBackup Withholding. For each calendar year, KUE will report to its U.S. Partners and to the Internal \nRevenue Service the amount of distributions that it pays, and the amount of tax (if any) that it withholds \non these distributions. Under the backup withholding rules, a U.S. Limited Partner may be subject to \nbackup withholding tax with respect to distributions unless a Limited Partner: (i) is a corporation or comes \nwithin another exempt category and demonstrates this fact when required or (U) provides a taxpayer \nidentification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding tax and otherwise \ncomplies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding tax rules. Exempt Limited Partners \nwho are U.S. Persons should indicate their exempt status on a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN. \nBackup withholding is not an additional tax, the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a \nLimited Partner will be allowed as a credit against such Limited Partner's U.S. federal income tax liability. \nNominee Reporting. Persons who hold an interest in KUE as a nominee for another Person are required \nto furnish to KUE: \n(a) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the \nnominee, \n(b) whether the beneficial owner is: \n(1) a person that is not a U.S. Person, \n(2) a foreign government, an international organization, or any wholly-owned agency \nor instrumentality of either of the foregoing, or \n(3) a tax-exempt entity; \n(c) the amount and description of the Limited Partner Units held, acquired, or transferred for \nthe beneficial owner, and \n144 \n\f(d) specific information including the dates of acquisitions and transfers, means of \nacquisitions and transfers, and acquisition cost for purchases, as well as the amount of \nnet proceeds from sales. \nFiling Requirements. Limited Partners who are U.S. Persons will be required to file an IRS Form 8865 \nwith the Partner's U.S. Federal Income tax return for the taxable year in which the Limited Partner \npurchases the Common LP Units.
