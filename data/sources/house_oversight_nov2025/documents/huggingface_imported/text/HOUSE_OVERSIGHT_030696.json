Then tomorrow AM to LA to do Bill Maher show. \nMaking money is hard work. \nOn Thu, Jan 18, 2018 at 7:38 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030696 \nhow was it.? why dont you stop by today so we can script tomorrow. - assuming no change. . prefer \nno details on email \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
