This was exacerbated by:\no soft power demand growth (particularly in Europe);\ngeneration overcapacity;\ndelays in capital spending;\nlower commodity prices (particularly as a result of US shale gas production);\ncentral banks’ quantitative easing;\npolitical interference (notably in Europe);\nhigh debt loads;\nthe Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan; and\n© concerns about interest rate rises from today’s very low levels.\nIt is hard to imagine a more perfect storm for the global utility sector than that which has played out\nover the past 4 years.\n\n0000000\n\ne Potential Exists for Snarp Outperformance\n\nGlobally or regionally, it is not unusual to find long and/or sharp periods of utility underperformance (as\nwith the current record period). During such periods, when combined with wholesale shorts and market\nunderweighting, the sector becomes poised for extended outperformance rallies. This results from\nfundamental investors (both long/short and long-only) rotating into the sector en masse, bidding up the\nbest value and growth utilities and underweighting or shorting utilities with poor business\n\n15 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024216",
