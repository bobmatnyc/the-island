How he verified that, I don’t\nknow. The question is, did\nanything illegal occur. The law\nwas not violated here.”\n\nHe had no explanation as to\nwhy Epstein would pay girls or\nwomen with no massage train-\ning — as the alleged victims\nsaid was the case — $200 to\n$300 for their visits. “The\ncredibility of these witnesses\nhas been seriously ques-\n\nees - - Boos\n\nEpstein’s lead attorney\n\noe\n\ntioned,” Goldberger said.\n\nEpstein, 53, was indicted\nby a county grand jury last\nmonth on a charge of felony\nsolicitation of prostitution. At\nter an 11-month investigation\nthat included sifting through\nEpstein’s trash and surveilling\nhis home, Palm Beach police\nconcluded there was enough\nevidence to charge him with\nsexual activity with minors.\nWhen the grand jury indicted\nEpstein on the less serious\n\nre\n\neoWO Suywqns\n\nWIN\n\ncharge, Police Chief Michael\nReiter referred the case to the\nFBI to determine whether\n\n(1-8-9 “Aey) ogetat\n\nthere were federal law viola- -\n\ntions.\n\nAfter a spate of stories\n\nabout the case last week, New\nYork publicist Dan Klores —\nwhose client list has included\nParis Hilton and Jennifer Lopez\n— said on Saturday that Ep-\nstein’s camp was ready “to get\ntheir story out.”\n\nSee EPSTEIN, 9B >\n\n= 3\nQ BR sue\na BOaA> 5\noo ™ ©\na Ro}\nSs 7 00 »\n3 o —~ 3G\n2 3258\nfaa s:\n° Doo\na Qa 92 »\nm 3 2 -35\n: — oO QQ a Qa\n= o= ~ wo\ns Sra\n= 89 yu 38\n= 6 2 co] 2 oO\n° <3 9 ae\n© S| o\n& a9 a\nN op -\nbp oO\n»\na\n\njo aweu ‘ebed ayeo1pul)\n\n‘@®\n\noI\n\n*\n\n;\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018935",
