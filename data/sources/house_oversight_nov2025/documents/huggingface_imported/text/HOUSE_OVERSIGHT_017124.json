I crave reruns of television sit-\ncoms and revivals of shows I hated in their original incarnations.\n\nThose must have been wonderful times to evoke such strong - and expensive - reactions.\n\nI then described a nostalgia weekend that I and six guys I grew up spent at the Concord Hotel in\nthe Catskill Mountains, where we once had gone to summer camp or worked as waiters. The guys\nplayed one-on-one basketball and horse (even those who hated hoop as kids). We told jokes so\nold you could give them numbers (itself one of the oldest jokes). And we wondered about why\nour lost adolescence exerted such magnetic attraction.\n\n\"Those were the worst days of my life,\" one of the guys - who used to talk with a high\nvoice - confided. Suddenly, we were all contemplative. Our adolescence was miserable,\nwe acknowledged. As the Musak played \"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing,\" another\nrelated how he dreaded the slow dances because he would always become palpably\ntumescent (certainly not a phrase from our youth) while doing the fox trot. Another\nshocked us all by soberly confessing that he had become tumescent only once during his\nadolescence, but then he reassured us by bragging that \"it started when I was 12 and it\ndidn't stop until I was 21.\"\n\nI then recalled one of the most humiliating moments from my adolescence:\n\nIt was prom time, and the girls had established a committee of three to which the boys had\nto apply for dates. I had my eye on a pretty blonde from an adjoining neighborhood (her\ndistance, I hoped, might have kept her from learning of my questionable reputation among\nthe local parents). As I approached the committee and shyly uttered \"Karen,\" all three\narbiters laughed. \"Don't you know,\" the cruelest admonished me, \"that Karen is on the A\nlist and you're on the C list? You can only pick from the C or D lists.\" It was a relief to\nlearn there was a list lower than mine, but a shock to be confronted with my official\nranking. I went to the prom alone and danced with my cousin, who was also on the C list.\n\nThose were miserable years, all right. They were years of self-doubt, sexual guilt without sexual\npleasure, fears and transitions. Before you were comfortably into one stage you were already\nentering another, more precarious, one. They popped up as if on schedule, like the beginning of\nthe yo-yo, marbles or mumble typeg seasons. So I asked myself why I insisted on recapturing the\nmost miserable period of my life. This was my answer:\n\n[W]hen a man reaches the age of counting backward, maudlin nostalgia sets in and he\nbegins to run, not walk, to every restored toy emporium he hears about from other\nretrievers of lost youth.\"\n\na7\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017124",
