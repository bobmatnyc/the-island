  "text": "But still — from the Palestinian side... no proper\nresponse.\n\nThey clearly bear most of the responsibility for\npast failures.\n\nAnd | know, a fully fledged agreement is\nprobably not feasible today, But if this is the\ncase — and only a sincere effort can determine\nthis — we have to try and achieve a reasonable,\nfair, interim agreement.\n\nI strongly believe this is possible, while\nguaranteeing all our security and vital interests.\n\nBut if even an interim agreement is\nunobtainable, then we should consider\nunilateral steps, in order to place a wedge on\nthis extremely dangerous slippery slope\ntowards a binational state.\n\nIt involves demarcating a line within the land of\nIsrael... Within which we will have the\nsettlement blocs and a solid Jewish majority\nfor generations to come.\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027018",
