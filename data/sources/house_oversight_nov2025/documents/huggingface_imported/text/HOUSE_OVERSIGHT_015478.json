  "text": "NAUTILUS EDUCATION\n\nBETA PRODUCT\n\nRadioactive Carbon-14: Your pearly whites\n\nWhen you smile, the gleam of your teeth obscures a\nslight glow from radioactive waste. During the late\n1950s and early 1960s, atmospheric testing of thermo-\nnuclear weapons scattered so much radioactive car-\nbon-14 into the atmosphere that 1t contaminated vir-\ntually every ecosystem and human. Several thousand\nunstable radiocarbon atoms explode within and among\nyour cells every second as their unstable nuclei under-\ngo spontaneous radioactive decay. Some are the natu-\nral products of cosmic rays that can turn atmospheric\nnitrogen into carbon-14, while others result from the\ndecay of unstable mineral elements that are found in\nsoil. But many of them represent the echoes of ther-\nmonuclear airbursts from the Cold War, finding their\n\n18\n\nway into our water supply and meals. If they happen to\ndisintegrate within your DNA, they can damage your\ngenes. And many of them are bound up in your teeth.\nUnlike most of the atoms in your body, those embed-\nded in your strong, stable tooth enamel have been with\nyou ever since you ingested them through your umbili-\ncal cord and your infant feeding. If you were born dur-\ning the early 1960s, you have more nuclear waste in\nyour teeth than if you were born later, when soils and\noceans had had time to bury radioactive atoms. In fact,\nforensic scientists use the proportion of bomb carbon\nin tooth enamel to determine the age of unidentified\nhuman remains.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015478",
