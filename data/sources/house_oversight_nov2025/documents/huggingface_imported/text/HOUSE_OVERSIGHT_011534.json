  "text": "the post of Head of Military Intelligence. He knew the importance of\nintelligence, and the potential cost of Israel being taken by surprise in a future\nwar, having been part of the top military leadership during Rotem. He was\nenergetic, bright, and exuded an infectious sense of self-confidence and\nauthority. He also had clout at headquarters. If he decided the time had come to\nrevive cross-border intelligence operations, there was every chance it would\nhappen.\n\nStill, it was an agonizingly slow process. By the time my period of military\nservice was drawing to an end, it hadn’t happened. I did not seriously think of\nleaving. Though my two years in Sayeret Matkal had been the most physically\ndemanding of my life, they were also the most fulfilling. I did not want to\nforfeit the chance of being part of its finally becoming an operational unit. So I\ncommitted to at least a few more years in the military. I joined my closest friend\namong the recruits, Uri Zakay, for six months in officers’ school as we waited,\nor hoped, for approval to actually use the skills and qualities we had acquired in\nthe sayeret.\n\nAnd in the summer of 1962, shortly after I returned to the unit from officers’\nschool as a second-lieutenant, the green light finally came.\n\n63\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011534",
