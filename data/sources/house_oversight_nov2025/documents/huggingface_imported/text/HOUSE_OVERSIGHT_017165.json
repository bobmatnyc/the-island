  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nchances.” That was the last I heard, until a few years later when Dean Griswold informed me that\nthe chairman of the overseers subcommittee being asked to review and approve the faculty\ndecision recommending me for tenure, was an active member of “the Club.” I was ready for a\nfight. But there was no fight. I was approved, the dean later told me, by a unanimous vote.\n\nSeveral years after I began teaching, I was invited to deliver a distinguished named lectureship at\na major university. Following my talk, there was a dinner in my honor at the local university club.\nWhen I got to the club, there were several women standing outside picketing because it was a\nmen’s only club. I refused to cross the picket line and the dinner had to be moved to a different\nvenue, over the strong objections of the Chief Justice of the State, who was one of the sponsors\nto the dinner. I had a similar experience in Columbus, Ohio, after I argued an important case on\nbehalf of a local law firm. They invited my female associate and me to have dinner with them at\nthe local university club. When we got there, they asked my associate if she wouldn’t mind\nwalking in through the side door since the main entrance was for men only. Since she was a\nyoung associate, she reluctantly agreed, but I refused to let her demean herself. We had lunch at\nthe local McDonald’s. Several years later, I was invited to Australia to give a series of lectures,\nand the Harvard Club of Sydney asked me to give a luncheon talk to Harvard alumni. I agreed.\nWhen I mentioned to a friend that I was going to be speaking at the Australia Club, he advised me\nthat it was closed to Jews, women, and Blacks. I gave the Harvard Club two options: I would\nkeep my commitment and make my speech, but I would speak about why it was wrong for\nHarvard to hold events at segregated clubs; or they could move the speech and I would give a talk\nabout life at Harvard. They chose the second alternative. When I returned to Harvard, I wrote to\nthe dean and a memo was circulated mandating that henceforth no Harvard professors, speaking\non behalf of Harvard, should appear in a segregated venue. When a Jewish country club in\nBoston asked me to talk, I told them about my policy and declined the invitation. They explained\nthat the club had been established in reaction to the unwillingness of other country clubs in the\narea to accept Jewish members. I told them that I did not think this justified further\ndiscrimination. A few days later, the membership chairman called and told me that, in fact, the\nclub had six non-Jewish members and that it was open to accepting more. I made the speech. A\nyoung member approached me following my speech and told me I had been conned, “Sure, we\nhave six non-Jewish members, but they’re all sons-in-law of Jewish members.” I have never\nspoken at that club again.\n\nWhen I joined the faculty, it was quite small—perhaps two dozen full time professors. (Today\nthere are more than 100, with a student body that hasn’t increased in size.) The entire faculty\nwould meet for lunch every day in a small dining room around a large table presided over by the\ndean, and in his absence by a senior faculty member. The discussions would revolve around legal\nissues. The criteria for judging an argument and its maker was its “soundness.” That word still\nrings in my ear, like my grandmother’s “meturnished.” All faculty nominees had to have “sound”\njudgment. Their writing had to be “sound,” rather than creative, speculative, quirky or\nprovocative. I was concerned because my views were anything but “sound”—as least as judged\nby some of the more traditional faculty members.\n\nRecently, I told one of my long-time colleagues that when I was choosing between teaching at\n\nHarvard and Yale Law Schools, my Yale Law School teacher, mentor and friend, Professor Alex\nBickel, who had been turned down for a professorship at Harvard because his views of\n\n78\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017165",
