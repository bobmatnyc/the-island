  "text": "Vocabulary and Catechism\n\nThe words microeconomics and macroeconomics, by the way, didn’t exist until\nRagnar Frisch coined them in the 1920s. We use terms retrospectively to describe\nold arguments in language familiar now. That segues into the next steps in the\nfoundations. What should be the basic vocabulary and catechism, meaning basic\n\nlogic, in terms understood today?\n\nConsideration of purpose always comes first. The purpose of economics is\nprediction. We happen to know that one of the most powerful predictors of\neconomic behavior is maximization of risk-adjusted return. This was Robert\nTurgot’s insight of 1766, although he left the risk variable unsaid. (His real first\nname was somehow Anne, so we'll go with the second). He wrote that return\nequilibrates across markets as investors leave low-return businesses to crowd into\nhigher-return ones. The shift bids up capital denominators in the higher-return\nbusinesses, and conversely, until return converges. It was David Ricardo, in 1817\nwho added that the convergence is more exactly for businesses judged equal in risk.\nThe evidence is everywhere we look. I call this the maximand rule: all behavior\nmaximizes perceived risk-adjusted rate of return. I'll show its proof below. That\nmeans all behavior in all markets, and markets are where any choice among\nalternatives is made. Return means ratio of (net) output to capital generating it.\n\nThen the vocabulary wanted might as well include capital and output.\n\nBut what is capital? Economics is choices, and the measure is price or value. Price\ncan’t be measured exactly outside literal markets, which is why economists follow\nthose markets, but is measured in principle by what we give up in exchange. The\nprice of any capital, even human capital, is given by the present value rule as time-\ndiscounted cash flow. Then cash flow and its positive and negative components\nbelong to the basic vocabulary, while the present value and maximand rules both\nbelong in the catechism. Output is total return, so the total return truism belongs in\n\nthe catechism too.\n\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 8\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010979",
