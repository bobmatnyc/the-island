  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nThe only theory on which I thought she could possibly succeed was that Brooke’s mother had no\nright to surrender her daughter’s privacy and that Brooke, now approaching adulthood, should\nhave control over her own image.\n\nUltimately the court ruled, in a bizarre opinion, that Brooke had essentially waived her right to\nprivacy by allowing the photographs to be published earlier, and by pursuing a career in which she\nhas relied on her sexuality for her success. The court put it this way:\n\n“Much of plaintiff's recent commercial activity upon which her fame is based has been far\nmore sexually suggestive than the photographs which have been shown to the court.\nThese photographs are not sexually suggestive, provocative or pornographic; they do not\nsuggest promiscuity. They are photos of a prepubescent girl in innocent poses at her bath.\nIn contrast, defense counsel have submitted numerous samples of sex-oriented publicity\nconcerning plaintiff. Particularly notable is her widely televised sexually suggestive\nadvertisement for blue jeans. Recent film appearances have been sexually provocative\n(e.g., “The Blue Lagoon”, “Endless Love”’.). Plaintiff's claim of harm is thus undermined\nto a substantial extent by the development of her career projecting a sexually provocative\nimage.\n\nThis reasoning fails to distinguish between a 17 year old and a 10 year old. The earlier\nphotographs were taken of a 10 year old kid, whose mother controlled what she would do. Her\nlater appearances were made by a near-adult and were far more within her own control. The\ncourt simply ignored the argument by the 10 year old should not be bound by foolish decisions\nmade by an ambitious mother when Brooke was too young to say no.\n\nI believe that if this case were to come before a court today, in light of the new sensitivity toward\nchild exploitation, the case would have been cited in favor of Brooke Shields. I had mixed\nfeelings about the result because it was a victory for the First Amendment, but at a heavy cost to a\nyoung woman about to enter college. Eventually the case was settled and the calendar wasn’t\ndistributed to Brooke’s Princeton classmates. Brooke Shields went on to a successful career as a\nmulti-dimensional performer.\n\nAnother conflict arose when a blogger posted a naked photograph of a famous athlete’s two year\nold son, and in the caption focused the viewer’s attention on the size of the boy’s penis. The issue\nI was asked to address was whether the blog met the criteria for child pornography, which is not\nprotected by the First Amendment. This was an unusual request, since in most of my prior cases\ninvoking charges of child pornography, I defended the person charged. In one such case, a\nmedical student who had worked as a camp counselor had taken thousands of photographs of his\ncampers, including several of them “skinny dipping.” The focus of the photographs was not on\nthe genitals and we argued that they were no different, as a matter of law, from nude photographs\ntaken by recognized artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe, Sally Mann and David Hamilton that\nwere exhibited in museums. I won that case and several others like it.\n\n133\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017240",
