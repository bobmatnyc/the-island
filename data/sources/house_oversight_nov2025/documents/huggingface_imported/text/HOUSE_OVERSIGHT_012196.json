  "text": "ALLEN GUTHRIE MCHuGH & THOMAS, PLLC\n\nMr. John Roth\nJune 19, 2008\nPage 14\n\nAppx. 849, 2006 WL 14581 at *3 (1 1” Cir. 2006) (to establish Sims’s guilt on the sex trafficking of\na minor count, the government had to show that Sims benefited financially from Owen’s sexual\nactivity and that Sims knew that (a) force or coercion would be used to cause Owens to engage in a\ncriminal sex act or (b) that Owens was under the age of 18.) (emphasis added). Again, none of these\nfactors is present in this case. The Eleventh Circuit’s interpretation of the statute makes perfect\nsense: were § 1591 not limited in this fashion, it would threaten to criminalize a host of localized\nbehavior that has nothing to do with human trafficking, and, thus, is of no valid federal interest.\n\nIn sum, to accord discretion to the USAO, albeit without benefit of the requested full de novo\nreview, to exercise authority to pursue a prosecution which involves a “novel” application of three\nfederal statutes in the face of numerous “compelling arguments” is not warranted, as it is not\nsupported by the facts, the law, or justice. Echoing the admonition of the Supreme Court in the\nBerger decision, the Comment to Rule 3.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (Special\nResponsibilities of a Prosecutor), says it best “A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of\njustice and not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to\nsee that a defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of\nsufficient evidence.” This is a responsibility that can not be taken for granted. The government bears\nthe burden of assuring that it possesses sufficient evidence to prove each element of a crime with\nrespect to some specific victim before publicly branding Mr. Epstein a child molester. In this case,\nhowever, the USAO has not met its burden for any victim for any of the crimes alleged. It is not\nenough to simply gloss over the required proof, and rely on the jury or the court to just sort it all out\nin the end. The stakes are too high. As a result, the USAO should not be permitted to pursue an\nunfounded federal criminal case against Mr. Epstein under the guise of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nSuch prosecution in this case necessarily would appear to be selective to Mr. Epstein. To be\nclear, our request that Mr. Epstein should not be prosecuted federally would not permit him to go\ncompletely unpunished, but, rather, would simply place him in the same prosecution position as\nothers similarly situated. Therefore, we continue to believe that after a complete, de novo, and\nindependent review, the only appropriate conclusion will be that this case is best left to the state to\nresolve.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSTEPHANIE D.
