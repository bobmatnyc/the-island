  "text": "11\n\nunder the rule of locally chosen leaders whom the Europeans knew\nthey could trust. It is possible that the current transformations might\nresult in security vacuums that local parties or foreign powers could\nexploit to fragment some Arab states into smaller units that would\nthen be more reliant on foreign support or protection.\n\nSudan has already split into northern and southern states, while\nYemen, Iraq and possibly a few others are similarly susceptible to\nsubdivision into smaller statelets. This raises difficult issues about the\ninviolability of the current Arab borders that the retreating Europeans\ncreated last century. I thought the secession of South Sudan was a\nperfectly acceptable development, if it reflected the will of the people\nof the south, and was not imposed on them. The operative principle\nin such possible developments is whether change reflects the consent\nof the governed and represents the will of the majority, while\nprotecting the rights of minorities. If Yemenis decide to split again\ninto two or even three states, and this reflects the free will of the\nYemeni people, they should be allowed to do so without external\ninterference.\n\nThere is nothing sacred or permanent about the borders of any\ncountry, especially Arab countries that were mostly created by the\nhandiwork of European colonial officers. Countries evolve and\nsometimes change shape as a routine historical process. If some\nArabs decide they are uncomfortable with their existing state\nboundaries and they wish to break away and form a separate country,\nthat should always be an option. After all, the world mostly rejoiced\nwhen the former Soviet Union and its empire collapsed and some of\nits constituent republics fragmented into smaller units, notably\nYugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.\n\nWe should be prepared to deal with the specter of existing Arab\ncountries that reconfigure their frontiers and populations while they\nare reconfiguring their political governance systems.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032181",
