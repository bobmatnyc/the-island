  "text": "Bottom Line, as Data in This Presentation Indicate...\n\nUSA Inc.’s expenses far exceed revenue — and government\nprojections imply this trend will get worse, not better.\n\nIn addition - while not addressed in depth in this presentation - USA Inc.\n(while still a global powerhouse), at the margin, is losing competitive\nadvantage to many other countries.\n\nInstead of ignoring the problems, we simply ask the question...\n\nHow would a financial / turnaround expert look at USA Inc.’s financials,\nbusiness model, strategic plans, efficiency and aim to drive the\n‘business’ to break-even (or a modest profit) over the next\n\n5-10 years?\n\nKP\nwww.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 233\n\nMatching Expenses & Revenue:\n\nImperatives & Constraints\n\nThere are many reasons to make changes\n— USA Inc. is losing money, and forecasts imply it will continue to lose money.\n\n— Net debt levels (62% in F2010) are expected to surpass 90% threshold* — above\nwhich real GDP growth could slow by more than one percentage point — by 2021E.\n\nSpending (primarily related to entitlement programs) is at unsustainable levels\nbased on USA Inc.'s ability to fund the spending (without increasing debt levels).\n\n— Americans rank ‘reducing America’s debt’ as one of country’s top priorities,\naccording to a national survey by Peter G. Peterson Foundation in 11/09.\n\n— We are now in the midst of a major generational baton-passing (from the Baby\nBoomers to Generation X) which requires preparation for policy change.\n\n— Foreigners own 46% (and rising) of USA Inc.’s debt, per Treasury Department —\nAre they going to keep funding USA Inc.’s spending?\n\nNote: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the relationship between government debt\nand real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average\ngrowth falls considerably more. We note that while Reinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer\nto the European countries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.\nwww.kpcb.com\n\nUSA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 234\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020958",
