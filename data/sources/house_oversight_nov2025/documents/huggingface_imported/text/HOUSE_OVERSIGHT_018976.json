I placed the tape in the telex copy-et,\nseries 2 machine and began to go through the copying process.\nApproximately 1/2 through the tape, the tape wrapped around the\nspindle and became locked and stretched the tape. I examined it and\ndetermined that it was in the best interest to leave it as it is as a\nprior copy had been made and turned over to Sergeant Frick. I\nimmediately took the tape to Sergeant Frick and allowed him to examine\nit and then obtained the copy from him and Detective Recarey and\nbrought the copy of the tape down and made a copy for him based on\nthat. The tape was placed back in the original container and is\nretained in the evidence bag under the previously mentioned property\nnumber of 05-243. It is not advisable to attempt to copy this tape as\nfurther damage could result to the recorded material and there is an\nexisting copy anyway.\n\nKEKEKKKEKEEKKEREEEEEEREKEEEEE NARRATIVE He RK KKKRKEKKKEKREREEKEEEREREREEK\nNA Reported By: PARKINSON, GREGORY A. 9/26/05\nEntered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 9/26/05\n\nOn 3-24-05 at 11:00 pm, a copy of tape 2 (case number 05-294) had been\nmade for Det.

I notified Sgt. Frick and Det. Recarey. I was informed that\nthey had a prior copy and I could use it to make a master tape. I did\nso and when reviewing and signing the evidence sheet, I noticed\nEvidence Specialist Badger had written \"#2 is blank.\"\n\nI obtained that copy from Det. Recarey and made a new copy on a .\nstandard size tape. The new copy was placed in the evidence bag under\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018976",
