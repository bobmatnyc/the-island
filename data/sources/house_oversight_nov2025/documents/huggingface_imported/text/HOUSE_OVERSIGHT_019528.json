Snowden’s own disillusionment about the govern-\n\n© ment might have begun with his rejection and perceived mistreat- ©\nment by the Special Forces of the U.S. Army.

He became particularly concerned with what he called\nthe “secret powers” of the NSA. He saw them as “tremendously\ndangerous.” By this time, Snowden was fully aware that the NSA\nconducted domestic surveillance because he had used his privileges\nas a system administrator in 2012 to read the NSA inspector gen-\neral’s report on a 2009 surveillance program.\n\nNevertheless, Snowden continued to work at the NSA, where he\nwas, as he put it, “making a ton of money.” Mills joined him in his\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 40 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019528",
