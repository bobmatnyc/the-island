One way I\ndo that is by avoiding jargon and by using terms that I think most people will recognize. I\noften write \"S&M\" instead of \"BDSM,\" for example; and when I'm using technical SM\nlanguage like \"top\" or \"bottom\" or \"scene,\" I try to define the words as I go along. But\nsometimes I slip into jargon by accident. Also, plenty of S&M terms are super useful, and\ngiving a quick overview of S&M language can go a long way towards describing S&M\nculture. Hence, this glossary. Many of the terms in the Glossary aren't terms that I used\nin this book, but you might find it useful or interesting anyway. (I also included a few\nterms that come from other subcultures, like polyamory or queer studies or feminism,\nbecause why not.)\n\nte ok ok\n\naftercare (BDSM): A cool-down period after an S&M encounter, which often involves\nreassurance and a discussion of how things went. Aftercare is discussed a lot in this book,\nespecially in \"Aftercare or Brainwashing?\" (part 3).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018699",
