Subject: Request for comment from The Mail on Sunday with noon ET Saturday deadline re Mr Bradley
Edwards vs Mr Jeffrey Epstein

Dear Sirs:
We are preparing an article about the calendaring today of Mr Edwards' claim against Mr Epstein for jury trial
and the witness list which names pnd other young women who allege they were underage

victims of Mr Epstein.

Mr Edwards claims that Mr Epstein maliciously attempted to intimidate him and his clients into retracting their
claims.

ui further has stated to us that she intends to testify that she was flown to London by Mr Epstein and
instructed to have sex at age 17 with Prince Andrew. She alleges that she was paid $15k for this encounter.

She claims that on another occasion, Mr Epstein flew two young women to a dinner for the purpose of
entertaining President Clinton. She claims she herself was sex trafficked to several other men, whose contact
information is contained in an address book of Mr Epstein's filed in court records.

May we have a comment please? Our deadline is 1pm tomorrow (SATURDAY) ET.

Yours sincerely,
Sharon Churcher
