  "text": "Or, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange “Jeffrey”\nstories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate billionaire and\npublisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of Epstein), with a\ntwinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of Epstein escapades. It is an\noutréness that Epstein seems delighted to cultivate. In his Paris apartment, 10,000\nsquare feet on the Avenue Foch, a neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign\npotentates, there is a stuffed baby elephant in his living room—that is, the e/ephant\nin the room. (Epstein says too it’s a reminder of his genetic engineering initiatves\nthat are inspired by the fact that elephants have 23 copies of tumor suppressor\ngenes, never getting cancer in the first place. while humans have only 1.) The\nsingle book on his bedside table is Lolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov\nfan).\n\nOr, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the world.\nThere is a media version of the world, in which most of us live and largely\naccept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those people who live in\nthe reality and therefore know that the media version is mostly bunk. If the media\ntrumpets it, it is likely that some version of the opposite is true. I might guess too\nthat for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there but for the\ngrace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time, himself also run\nafoul of prosecutors, the political moment, the media, or the Internet hoi pollo.\n\nIn this view, Epstein is a sort of Dreyfus of the rich.\n\nAnd then there is the glue of wealth. Once, at lunch in the Epstein dinning\nroom with Bill Richardson, the former Governor of New Mexico, and past\nPresidential aspirant, when Epstein left the room for a few minutes, I asked the\nobvious question, the one everybody asks each other, “How did you meet Jeffrey?”\nRichardson seemed surprised: “Jeffrey,” he said, as though stating what should\nhave been perfectly obvious, “is one of the largest landowners in New Mexico.”\n\nAnd then there is Epstein’s yet more structural explanation as to why after\njail and with continuing tabloid infamy he can maintain his valued place. It comes\nback, not unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money:\n\n“At a certain level of finance, almost everyone is attached to an\ninstitutional . You are part of government, you want to be in government, or you\nare connected to a major bank or other portfolio, or you have fundamental\nrelationships with distinct corporations or industries. Because of my more\ncolorful past, I have none of that. I have no restrictive institutional ties which\nmakes me in some sense one of the few wholly independent sources of information\nand truly independent brokers. That’s the usefulness of disgrace.”\n\nAnd then there is too, that he is right. Since I began working on this piece in\nSeptember, Epstein predictions about the price of oil, yen, ruble, and euro have all\nborn out.
