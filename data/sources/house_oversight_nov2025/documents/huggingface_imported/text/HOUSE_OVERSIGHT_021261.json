  "text": "that anthropomorphism is associated\nwith the activation of the same prefrontal\nareas that are active when people think\nabout themselves or project themselves\nonto others.\n\nConclusion\n\nJust as critically, the study of\ninvisible forces requires a discussion of\nthe method that successful teams use to\nwork together as they cross disciplinary\nboundaries. Over the past few decades,\nthere has been a demonstrable shift from\nthe individual genius as the source of\nscientific and scholarly breakthroughs to\ninterdisciplinary teams. This shift in the\nproduction of cutting-edge knowledge\nhas been documented in all fields of\nscholarly activity, ranging from\nmathematics and theoretical physics to\nthe humanities. This shift has both made\npossible and been necessitated by a need\nto understand complex behaviors.\nAlthough this project is primarily about\nthe ways that scientists seek to study the\nimpact of invisible forces, it will also\nreflect the methodologies that these\nresearchers use so that their work is not\nconstrained by common knowledge.\n\nThe philosophy of science also\nlooks different when dealing with simple\ncausality (one-to-one relations) than with\ncomplex causality. Affirmation of the\nconsequent, a logical error in which a\ngiven cause for an effect is inferred\nbased on the observation of the effect,\ndoes not lead to a scientific error when\nthere is but a single cause for the\nobserved effect. However, as scientific\ninquiry addresses increasingly complex\nphenomena, and increasingly complexly\ndetermined phenomena, the philosophy\nof science needs to become more\nnuanced.\n\nA core challenge is to develop a\n“science” of identification and\n\nPage |15\n\naggregation of these invisible forces at\ndifferent levels. Related research\nquestions include why they exist, and\nmeasures of robustness. One of our\ncentral goals is to demonstrate not only\nthat considerations of these forces\nmatter, but that that they can matter a\nlot.\n\nThere also are questions of value\nand ethics that could be implicated:\ndescriptive knowledge, models,\nawareness of causal relationships, and so\non, might not be enough to answer some\nkinds of questions, especially those\nrelated to value and purpose, which are\nthe very energies that animate and\ninvigorate real human systems.\nEconomics comes close with its proxy\nmeasure of value based on the\ndistribution of scarce resources and\npeople’s varying need for these\nresources. But this theory comes up\nshort in many instances where other\nvalues are at play that are beyond\nmarkets, such as in assessing the value\nof a human life, or whether all lives are\nof equal value. It is an especially poor\nmodel for helping us understand\nsomething as simple as the value of\narticles of sentimental value, such as\nfamily photographs, which may have\nlittle or no market value at all. Thus,\nhow do we best understand the\n“sentiments” that are important in the\nreal world?\n\nThe members of the Network\nhave worked beyond the boundaries of\ndisciplinary borders, geographical\nprecincts, and epistemological comfort\nzones to develop a rigorous but\ninnovative approach to the study of the\nhuman mind, sociality, spirituality,\nhealth, and well being. The Network\nmembers represented in this book are\nGary Berntson from Ohio State\nUniversity, Don Browning from the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021261",
