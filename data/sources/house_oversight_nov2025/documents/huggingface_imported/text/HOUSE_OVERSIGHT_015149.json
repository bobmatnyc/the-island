  "text": "Blitzer from CNN asked Clinton at a press conference what he would like\nto say to me, Clinton smiled and said, “That’ s good, that’ s\ngood” —referring sarcastically to the question—but it was extremely\nironic, because that’ s exact/y what | imagined he did say to me: “That' s\ngood, that’ s good.” And | replied, “Il gave you a blow job, but! didn’ t\nswallow.” He started laughing hysterically, just like that time he did with\nBoris Yeltsin. Bill liked my sense of humor. That’ s why we went from\nflirtation to friendship.\n\nHowever, the reasons | visited the White House thirty-seven times\nwas not for Bill—it was to be with Hillary—she was the one who desired\nme physically. The rumor about her being a lesbian was true. And so my\nrelationship with Bill was complicated. He just acted as a middle man for\nHillary, and now, by denying an affair with me he’ s telling the truth and\ntaking the fall for Aer In that sense, he’ s an incredibly loyal husband.\nDespite what the public may think, Bill is absolutely devoted to Hillary.\n\nEverybody is watching so closely for him to commit the next\nindiscretion, but it would have to be with somebody he can fota//y trust,\nsomebody who could suck the leader of the Western World’ s dick and\nnot confide in a friend, or to somebody who pretended to be a friend. So,\n\nfor a while, Bill is left with only Buddy’ s tongue for sexual companionship.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015149",
