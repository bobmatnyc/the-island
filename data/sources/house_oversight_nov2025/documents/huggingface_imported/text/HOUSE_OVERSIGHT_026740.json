  "text": "Some of these have been found — there are thought to be many millions in the Milky\nWay. There’s one orbiting the nearest star, Proxima centauri\nAnd another nearby faint star has 7 Earth-sized planets around it\n\nWill there be life on them — maybe even intelligent life?\n\nThe outer three are in the habitable zone\n\nThey’d be spectacular places to live. Viewed fro the surface of one of the planets, the\nothers would loom larger than our moon does to us — swinging past fast across the\nsky.\n\nBut they’re very un-Earthly. Probably tidally locked so that they present the same\nface to their star -one hemisphere in perpetual light. The other always dark.\n\nAnd _ the real goal, of course, is to see these exo-planets directly -- not just to infer\nthem from their shadows .\n\nBut that's hard. To realise just how hard, suppose an alien astronomer with a\npowerful telescope was viewing the Earth from (say) 30 light years away -- the\ndistance of a nearby star. Our planet would seem, in Carl's famous phrase, a 'pale\nblue dot’, very close to a star (our Sun) that outshines it by many billions: a firefly next\nto a searchlight.\n\nThe shade of blue would be slightly different, depending on whether the Pacific\nocean or the Eurasian land mass was facing them. The alien astronomers could infer\nthe length of our ‘day', the seasons, the gross topography, and the climate. By\nanalysing the faint light, they could infer that it had a biosphere.\n\nThe James Webb space telescope may offer clues. But within 10 years, the European\nSouthern Observatory, will hopefully have its ELT — with a mosaic mirror 39 metres\nacross.\n\nSuch instruments will be drawing inferences like this about exo-planets the size of\nour Earth.\n\nLIFE LIKELIHOOD\n\nHabitable doesn’t mean inhabited — but for most of us that’s the number-one\nquestion.\n\nWe still don’t know the likelihood — we know too little about how life began on Earth\nto lay confident odds. What triggered the transition from complex molecules to\nentities that can metabolise and reproduce? It might have involved a fluke so rare\nthat it happened only once in the entire Galaxy. On the other hand, this crucial\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026740",
