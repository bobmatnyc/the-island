  "text": "139\n\naccording to a former National Security Council staffer, the Russian cyber service in 2013 had the\nmeans, the time and the incentive to break the encryption. It is unlikely they would have gone to\nthe trouble since they had Snowden in the palm of their hand in Moscow. It doesn’t take a great\nstretch of the imagination to conclude that, by one way or another, willingly or under duress,\nSnowden shared his access to his treasure trove of documents with the agencies that were literally\nin control of his life in Russia.\n\nKucherena’s answer to the question of access also may help to explain Putin’s decision to allow\nSnowden to come to Moscow. As has been discussed earlier, it was not a minor sacrifice for\nPutin. His foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, had spent almost six months negotiating with Hillary\nClinton’s State Department a one-on-one summit between President Obama and President Putin.\nNot only would this summit be a diplomatic coup for Russia but it would add to Putin’s personal\ncredibility in advance of the Olympic Games in Russia. In mid-June, after US intelligence\nreported to Obama’s National Security adviser that Snowden was in contact with Russian officials\nin Hong Kong, the State Department explicitly told Lavrov that allowing Snowden to defect to\nRussia would be viewed by President Obama as a blatantly unfriendly act. As such, it could (and\ndid) lead to the cancellation of the planned summit. So Putin knew the downside of admitting\nSnowden.\n\nBut there was also an upside if Snowden had access to the NSA documents. A large archive of\nfiles containing the sources of the NSA’s electronic interceptions, as Snowden claimed he had in\nHong Kong, had enormous potential intelligence value Putin therefore had to choose between\nthe loss of an Obama summit and the gain of an intelligence coup. That Putin chose the latter\nsuggests that he had calculated that the utility of the intelligence that the NSA archive outweighed\nthe public relations advantages of the Obama summit (which, after Snowden arrived in Moscow,\nwas cancelled by Obama.) Would Putin have made such a sacrifice if Snowden had destroyed or\nrefused to share the stolen data? “No country, not even the United States, would grant sanctuary\nto an intelligence defector who refused to be cooperative,” answered a former CIA officer who\nhad spent a decade dealing with Russian intelligence defectors. “That’s not how it works.” If so, it\nseems plausible to me that, as Kucherena said, that Snowden’s documents were accessible to him\neither on a computer or via storage in the cloud after he arrived in Moscow. It explains why\nRussia exfiltrated him from Hong Kong and provided him with a safe haven,\n\nThe Quickly Changing Narrative\n\nJust three weeks after Kucherena’s stunning disclosure, Snowden changed the narrative. His\nfirst exchange with an American journalist after his arrival in Russia was not until October 1°7,\n2013. It was conducted over the Internet with James Risen, a Pulitzer-prize winning New York\nTimes reporter. Essentially Snowden supplied answers to a set of questions. In then, Snowden\nnow asserted he took no documents to Russia. The subsequent front-page story, which carried\nthe headline, “Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia,” reported that Snowden\nclaimed that he gave all his documents to journalists in Hong Kong and he brought none of them\nto Russia. He also said that he was “100 percent” certain that no foreign intelligence service had had\naccess to them at any point during his journey from Honolulu to Moscow.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020291",
