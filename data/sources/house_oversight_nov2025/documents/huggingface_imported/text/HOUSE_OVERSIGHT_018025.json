People in it lack courage.\n\nBut you’re no stranger to harsh criticism. People weren’t exactly nominating you\nfor a justice award for getting O.J. Simpson and Claus von Bulow off the hook.\n\nSome of the criticisms against me have been just. I’m a tough lawyer. But charging me\nwith one of the most heinous crimes is on a different level. I’ve never been attacked like\nthis. | don’t Know any lawyer or professor who’s had these accusations waged against\nthem. It’s worse than what Clarence Darrow had to face.\n\nYou retired from Harvard Law School a year ago. Did you expect so much\n\nexcitement at this stage of your career?\n\nThis is an absolute shock. |’m living my little life here [in Florida, New York and Martha's\nVineyard]. | lead a boring life. I've been married to the same woman for 28 years. She\ngoes with me everywhere. People know that | won’t argue a case or give a speech\n\nunless my wife travels with me. This is not the profile of someone who screws around.\nYou take all this very, very personally, don’t you?\n\nWouldn't you? |’ve got two grandchildren in college and they are reading this about me.\nThis is the fight of my life.\n\nNote: We have been in contact with Edwards and Cassell and hope to get their sides of\nthe story soon.\n\nhttps:/Awww.law.com/alm|D/1202715316005/Prof-Dershowitz-Tell-Me-How-You-Really-Feel/?slreturn=201 90308174659 3/3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018025",
