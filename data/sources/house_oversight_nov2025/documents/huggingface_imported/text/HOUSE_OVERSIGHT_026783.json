  "text": "One of the major tax raising provisions in the Tax Act is a one-time tax imposed on the accumulated\nearnings held in foreign subsidiaries of US companies. This provision is broader that it may first\nappear. Under the Tax Act, any 10% US shareholder of a foreign corporation (determined on December\n31, 2017) will be required to include in income, for the taxable year 2017, its proportionate share of the\nforeign corporation's undistributed earnings, if the foreign corporation is either a controlled foreign\ncorporation (CFC) or has at least one 10% US shareholder that is a corporation.\n\nThis law change could generate significant phantom income with respect to 10%-or-greater owned\nforeign portfolio companies both (i) for US taxable investors (including the general partner and its\nowners) in partnership funds organized in the United States and/or for US sponsors of non-US\nfunds. The Tax Act provides for reduced tax rates on such income for corporate investors of 8% (for\nearnings invested in tangible business assets) and 15.5% (for cash and cash equivalents), and 9.05% and\n17.54% for investors taxed as individuals.\n\n5. Tax-Free Section 1031 Like Kind Exchanges Eliminated Except for Real Property Transactions\n\nThe Tax Act eliminates the ability to qualify for tax-free exchange treatment under Code section 1031 if\nthe property being exchanged is personal property. Consequently, for transactions occurring after\nDecember 31, 2017, exchanges of artwork, equipment, vehicles or other personal property held for\ninvestment or for use in a business, including Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, for like kind property\nwill not eligible for Section 1031 tax treatment. Exchanges of real property continue to be eligible for\nSection 1031 exchange treatment.\n\n6. Certain Tax Accounting Rules Have Been Revised\n\nUnder prior law, net operating losses (NOLs) could be carried back two years and carried forward for\ntwenty years. Under the Tax Act, NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 generally\ncannot be carried back, but can be carried forward indefinitely. However, only 80% of a company's\ntaxable income is permitted to be offset by NOLs. The remainder of the unused NOLs will carry forward.\n\nThe Tax Act also expands the category of corporations and partnerships that are eligible to use the cash\nmethod of accounting. Certain businesses may derive a tax benefit by switching from the accrual\nmethod to the cash method of accounting.\n\n7. Deferred Compensation\n\nThe Tax Act generally leaves the current tax rules for deferred compensation intact. However, the Act\nalso includes a new deferral provision for certain types of broad-based employee equity, which may\napply to certain private companies.\n\n8. Estate and Gift Tax Changes\n\nIn 2017, an individual could give or transfer at death up to $5,490,000 without paying gift or estate taxes.\nThe Tax Act doubles the federal estate and gift tax unified exemption amount for estates of decedents\ndying and gifts made after December 31, 2017, and inflation adjustments will continue to\napply. Therefore, in 2018, an individual has approximately an $11.2 million exemption, and a married\ncouple has approximately $22.4 million of available shelter from federal gift and estate taxation. Note\nthat the large exemption which applies to gifts may be useful in federal income tax planning. For\nexample, large lifetime gifts of appreciated securities, artwork and other personal property (including\npossibly, a carried interest) to relatives who are in lower income tax brackets, or who reside in states\nwith lower, or no state income taxes could save the family substantial federal income and/or state\nincome taxes when such property is sold by the recipient of the gift.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026783",
