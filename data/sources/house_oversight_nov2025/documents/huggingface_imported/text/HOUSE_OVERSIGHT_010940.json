  "text": "been the easiest guy to be married to. He pinched pennies, went on trips while she\nheld up the home front, came home late. My mother had about the same story. But |\n\nsaw different sides of him at different times and places.\n\nTwice I saw him cry. Once we were listening to a Caruso record. He might well have\nheard Caruso, although | don’t recall that he said so. He would already have been 28\nwhen Caruso last sang at the Met. One of the two books he wrote by himself shows\nhim as an opera buff when on his own in Germany in the 1930s. He wrote what\noperas he had heard, who sang, and what he liked. My mother said the same. Once\nthey arrived late at a performance of La Boheme somewhere on the Riviera, couldn’t\nfind a program, liked the tenor, decided to help him, and learned that they had failed\n\nto recognize Beniamino Gigli.\n\nThe other time was about his and Teddy’s son Timmy. Timmy’s brain tumor was\ninoperable and growing. He was 13. The doctors had told them to prepare for the\nworst. We were in London. The papers said something about young toughs called\nTeddy boys. My father started crying. Timmy wouldn't make it, and the Teddy boys\n\nwould.\n\nI’ve now lost a son myself. You thank the graces for what's left to do. What’s left to\ndo includes composing, verse and economics. The first has panned out okay. A fair\nbit of the verse was set in the music. At least that makes it read and heard. Aside\nfrom the kind words of Modigliani and a few others, I can’t say as much for my\n\neconomics. So here goes again.\n\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 24\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010940",
