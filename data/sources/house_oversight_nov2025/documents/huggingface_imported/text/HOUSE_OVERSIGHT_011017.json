Human capital itself\nis versatile. Some retirees could unretire, and vodka plant workers might convert\n\nwith not much retraining. I will explore some of this idea later.\n\nHarrod’s Knife Edge\n\nSolow’s neoclassical growth model developed from ideas published a decade earlier\nby Roy Harrod. Harrod had described a “warranted growth path” given by the pace\nof technological innovation. He reasoned correctly that any effort to push\ninvestment faster must soon founder in the diminishing returns foreseen by Malthus,\nRicardo and West in 1815. But how could we get investment exactly right? There\nwas a critical “knife edge” with little margin for error. He was right to stress the\ndangers of overinvestment. I do the same. But free growth theory, and the\n\noverwhelming evidence that it is right, bring a new perspective.\n\nWhat Solow and other economists teach today , judging from the textbooks I read, is\nmore or less Harrod without the knife edge. We are taught to figure out the\nwarranted growth path, meaning the rate of technological growth, and then invest\njust enough, ex ante, to exceed depreciation by that margin. But my charts and tables\nshow that any investment beyond depreciation recovery is deadweight loss. There is\nno need to know the warranted growth path because optimum investment is nota\nfunction of whatever it might be. Depreciation investment captures the whole of\ntechnological growth, and further investment adds no more. It is money left on the\ntable. Optimum ex ante investment, at the collective scale, is depreciation\n\ninvestment. Ex post results will reveal the warranted growth path.\n\nWhat about Underinvestment?\n\nOne indication in the charts and tables might leave us puzzled. It is easy to\n\nunderstand the futility of ex ante investment (consumption restraint) beyond\n\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 26\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011017",
