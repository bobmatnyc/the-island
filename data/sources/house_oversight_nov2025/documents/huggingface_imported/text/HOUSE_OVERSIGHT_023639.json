  "text": "EP: What’s your take on Trump and\nRussia?\n\nPK: I read one article where an uniden-\ntified Russian official used the phrase\n“useful idiot”. That’s really what it is.\n\nIt’s like J. Edgar Hoover; he stayed\n\naround for decades [via] blackmail. I\nthink it’s the same thing, You don’t have\nto say it, you know. Hoover would just go\nto JFK and say, “We found some photo\nof you in bed with Marilyn Monroe. But\ndon’t you worry, we'll keep it in our safe.”\nEP: You've lived through some Red scares;\ncan you imagine any other time where\nthis Russia stuff would be forgiven?\nPK: | think foreign countries may have\ninfluenced previous elections.\nI don’t know, but it was mostly\nbefore the technology of the\nInternet. So, if there’s no In-\nternet, there ain’t no hackin’.\nIt’s like there ain’t no divorce\nif you don’t have no marriage!\nWhatever deal was made, or\nhacked, I think Trump decided\nto run the night of the 2011\nWashington Correspondent’s\nDinner. Obama had such\nSood jokes that night. But the\ncamera was on Trump, and you\ncould see that he was foaming.\nEP: That shot of him is amazing.\nThe video of Trump’s boiling\nback head. It’s really gorgeous.\nPK: Humiliation makes a differ-\nence. You know, years before\nany of this, Trump developed\nhis modus operandi for media/\npolitical success: You cheat.\nWhat pushed him into public profile was\nthe stated success of his book, The Art of\nthe Deal. But what I found out that is that\nhe bought 20,000 copies of his own book\nfrom Random House, and that made it a\nNew York Times Best Seller.\n\nSimilarly, L Ron Hubbard had his book\nDianetics. He had a Scientologist working\nat The New York Times who had access\nto the details of their best sellers lists.\nBack then, there was a list of cities that\nthe Times measured sales at particular\nbook stores. So, Hubbard didn’t have to\nbuy 20,000 copies, he just had his spy tell\nhim where to buy several copies at those\nlocations, and the Church of Scientology\nhad an instant “Best Seller”.\n\nEP: Earlier you mentioned two interesting\nwords: “assassination” and “impeach-\nment”. You have the benefit of having\n\nlived through Kennedy and Nixon.\n\nPK: My earliest remembrance of a Presi-\ndent was Franklin D Roosevelt.\n\nEP: Do you remember him on the radio?\nPK: Yes. He was famous for having his\nFireside Chats. Which, through these\ndecades, has evolved into tweets.\n\nEP: Here’s a very pointed question: When\nKennedy got shot — what's your memory\nof that?\n\nPK: Several memories. One was my first\nwife was out shopping, heard it on some-\nbody’s radio, and immediately bought a\nTV set. That’s one thing I remember, just\nbeing glued to the television...And I was\ngetting calls, maybe not that day, but from\n\nCartoon by Wende, from The Realist #37, Sept. 1962.\n\npeople wanting to write an article about\nthe conspiracy aspect of it. You know of\nJean Shepherd, right?\n\nEP: Of course.\n\nPK: He was a big influence on me. He said,\n“This will change the whole country.” He\nthought it was a coup. And it turned out\nthat the CIA had the Mafia do it. After\nall of my studying about it, that’s what it\nwas. The Mafia were the puppets of the\npuppeteer in that.\n\nI would listen to Jean Shepherd every\nnight, and he said — he predicted — that\nAmerica would have a dictator who won\nthe presidency because he came out of\nshow business. And it happened. You\nknow, [Trump’s] not like Ronald Reagan,\nwho came out of Hollywood, of course.\nBut in Reagan’s case, he couldn’t make\nthe distinction between reality and his\n\nmovie roles. But he did say he was willing\nto take a senility test! Of course, the sug-\ngestion that he’d take a senility test is a\nsuggestion that you already are senile.\nEP: Right. That’s very funny.\nPK: Jumping back to Trump. Along the\nsame lines of the buying the 20,000\ncopies of his book, the first day of his\npresidential campaign, he came down\nthe Trump Tower elevator. There were\npeople with placards, saying “TRUMP\n2016” — but they were all hired actors.\nFifty of ‘em.\nEP: You know, the success of that red hat\nreally disturbs me. It’s so idiotic — but it\nreally seemed to work.\nPK: I agree. No other presiden-\ntial candidate had a cap like\nthat. And a slogan. I’ve seen\npeople on TV asked, “What do\nyou think about the election?”\nOne elderly woman said, “Oh\nit’s wonderful! We're going to\nMake America Great Again!”\nEP: How could they win on a\ncampaign of awful messages?\nMaybe Steve Bannon is some\nAD&D wizard, casting a spell\nthat everything negative\nbecomes positive. “Trust me\nTrump: kick babies instead of\nkiss them. It ll work!”\nPK: I agree that’s possible.\nBut it’s narcissism that made\nTrump do this. Narcissism with\nskin so thin, it’s inside out.\nThat’s what he was\ndoing, too, during the cam-\npaign. If your skin is inside out,\nthen it’s projecting. Hillary “was a crook,”\nbut he was. He called Bernie Sanders\n“crazy” and he was. “Lyin’ Ted Cruz”...\nEP: Why do you think those nicknames\nwere so effective? It seemed, once you\nwere labelled by him, you were done.\nPK: Bush had his nicknames, but they\nwere favorable. He called Karl Rove his —\nEP: “Turd Blossom”!\nPK: Right, “Turd Blossom” ...and he was.\nEP: The prettiest turd.\nPK: Regarding Trump’s narcissism, here’s\nmy favorite joke: Trump was in the eleva-\ntor of Trump Tower. It stopped on one\nfloor and a woman got in. She said, “Oh!\nYou're Donald Trump! Oh my, I would\nlove to give you a blow job. I really would.\nI have a great reputation. I will make it\nthat you will never forget this blow job.\nI really am good. I practice a lot. And I\n\nWw\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023639",
