Like twin hammers,\nthese forces demolished most of what once seemed permanent: Kings, alchemists,\npopes, feudal lords – they were all undone.\nToday, a fresh hammer is cracking away at our world. The demands of constant,\ninstant connection are tearing at old power arrangements. The formation of\nnetworks of all kinds, for trade and biology and finance and warfare and any of a\nthousand varied needs, is producing new and still dimly understood sources of\npower. They are eroding the roots of an older order even as a new one is beginning\nto appear. In fact, this process is only beginning. The networks ahead of us will be\neven faster than those we have today. They will also be informed by artificial\nintelligence. The combination of these two forces – instantness and thinking\nmachines – will further deepen an already profound change.\nThat last great shift of the Enlightenment was a violent and wonderful\ntransformation. It produced winners and losers, triggered tragedy and lit fresh\ntriumphs. What lies ahead of us is the same. A new landscape of power is emerging\nnow. This book is its story, and the tale of the instinct that will divide those who\nmaster it from those who will be mastered by it.\n3\nPart One: The Nature of Our Age\n4\nChapter One:\nThe Masters\nIn which the immortal problems of power are discussed, and the possibility of a new\ninstinct is introduced.\n1.\nOne morning in of 1943, a Chinese writer named Nan Huai-Chin packed his bags in\nShanghai and began walking out of the city. He was headed west, and traced a route\nalong the Huang Pu river, as he headed out towards E’Mei Shan several thousand\nmiles away in Western China. E’Mei Shan – Eyebrow Mountain – was and is one of\nthe holiest Buddhist sites in China.\nNan was an unusual young man. At fifteen, he had won a national sword fighting\ncompetition against men twice his age. At sixteen he had been admitted to the best\nuniversity in Shanghai, where he excelled in the study of natural sciences and\nphilosophy. If you look at photos of Nan in those years, more or less at the moment\nhe left Shanghai for the mountains, you see a clean-shaven, and soft-skinned man.\nHe is handsome, with electric eyes. You can see, if you know to look, the rough\nintensity of the man he’d become during the anti-Japanese war: A toughness in his\nstance; some hint too in his grimace of a sword-fighter’s mercilessness. This was\nlong before Nan was regarded as one of the finest living exemplars of the Chinese\nBuddhist tradition, before he became known as Master Nan. This was before his\nflight from China with the Kuomintang in 1949 once the communists came to power,\nbefore his decades of wandering, and his eventual return to the mainland. All that\nlies ahead of the man you see in the photo. The man in the photo is young, energetic.\nHe is certain.\nIn Nan’s youth, in his early sword fighting days, he had come to understand that\nmastering the blade of his sword involved really training his internal spirit to the\nhighest possible level of sharpness. The spirit moved first, then – instants later – the\nsword. It was his desire to sharpen that inner blade that led him to E’mei Shan and\nthe study of Ch’an Buddhism. Ch’an – you may know it by its Japanese name, Zen – is\nthe steeliest of the Buddhist traditions, bred through the combination of the\nBuddha’s ancient Indian teachings with the mystical philosophical habits of Chinese\nDaoism. Its adherents explain that enlightenment in Ch’an demands concentration\nstrong enough to make and then smash diamonds. It produces, as a result, an\nunmatchable form of enlightenment. So, with the anti-Japanese war still smoldering,\nNan traveled for a month through his convulsing country and up E’mei Mountain,\nwhere he found a Ch’an lamasery near the peak. Once there, during three years of\nconstant effort and meditation and deprivation, he achieved a breakthrough to\nsamadhi, that state of spiritual alignment in which the world and your own soul\nbecome as transparent as water. Fear vanishes, as does lust or any real confusion\nabout the deeper currents of life. You become, the priests like to say, as resilient as a\n5\nnatural mountain spring: No matter what mud is thrown in, it is simply and\nnaturally bubbled away into clarity.\nFrom E’Mei temple, with this fresh, clear-running mind, Nan began a quest to\nsharpen his spirit even further. The journey took him, for nearly a decade, from\nmaster to master in China, from monastery to university to rural huts. These were\nthe places where the last bits of some of China’s most ancient traditions had been\ncarried, places where classical wisdom had survived a hundred years of national\nchaos. Nan’s wandering education resembled the way in which, in millennia past,\nmonks would make spiritual marathons around China, seeking an ever-sharper edge\nto their insights. Solitary monks would stride into packed monasteries and engage\nin tests of insight, contests to see who could feel the underlying nature of the world\nwith greater fidelity. The aim was, always, to touch the energy flows moving, just\nunseen, below our lives. “Ten thousand kinds of clever talk—how can they be as\ngood as reality?” So the famous Ch’an master Yun Men, who himself trained four\ngreat masters, faced down a King with pure silence in one such a battle. 1\nNan was trying to cultivate in himself deep ways of feeling and sensing the world.\nDuring his wandering study, he followed a path that would lead him to\nenlightenment in more than a dozen different schools of Buddhism. He mastered\neverything from medicine to calligraphy. His youthful success and energy at sword\nfighting, it emerged, was a sign of a prodigal genius. He became, in the 20 th century,\nrecognized as one of those crucial human vessels by which really ancient tradition is\npreserved and carried forward for new generations.\nAfter a few years of study, Nan saw the descending madness of Mao’s China and\nslipped out of the mainland for Taiwan. He lived for decades between Taipei and\nHong Kong and America. During this time his fame as a teacher grew. In the mid-\n1990s as China opened, Nan returned to the mainland. He had been invited by some\nof China’s most powerful families, the children of communist revolutionaries who\nwere groping for a sense of history and identity. They wanted to absorb the lessons\nof Chinese culture that Nan had internalized, they hoped to bend them into tools\nthey could use to shape a Chinese future. Might the old habits of the country, with\ntheir ancient roots, have something to offer a nation nearly splitting with the\nenergies of modernity? Nan agreed to set up a private school. He selected a site on\nthe shores of Lake Tai in Zhejiang Province, not far from Shanghai. He chose the\nlocation carefully: The still lake water near his campus was like a giant bath of\ncalming yin energy that balanced the urgent, uncertainly aggressive yang energy of\n1990s China into a kind of harmony. Ash trees shaded the study rooms in the\nsummer. Wild peonies erupted in pink and white each spring.\n1 So the famous Ch’an master: “Yun Men’s Every Day is a Good Day” in Thomas\nCleary, Secrets of the Blue Cliff Record: Zen Comments by Hakuin and Tenkei. (Boston,\nMass.: Shambhala, 2002) 39. Fir an excellent introduction to the thinking of Master\nNan, see Diamond Sutra Explained (Primodia Media 2007) and To Realize\nEnlightenment: Practice of the Cultivation Path (York Beach, ME: S. Weiser, 1994)\n6\nIt was here, when he was 92 years old, that I first came to know him.\n2.\nBefore I moved to Beijing in 2002 a friend took me aside and offered this thought:\n“Your life in China will change the way you see the world. But if you want to get the\nmost out of it, you have to understand that as important as being bilingual is, it is as\nimportant to be bicultural.” I had not honestly thought of this as part of my plan, but\nit seemed like good advice. I have hewed to it as a personal law ever since. From my\nfirst days in China, I lived almost entirely among the Chinese. I can, for instance,\nnearly number on one hand the meals I shared with Westerners over my years\nthere. This advice to learn to be bicultural really did change my experience of living\nin China. It changed how I saw the world. It presented moments of really honest and\nsearching confusion. I had conversations where I understood every word and yet\nhad no idea what my interlocutor meant. I had periods where I did not know which\nculture was pulling on my mind. But the decision produced, at least, a fortunate\nencounter that led me to Master Nan’s school.\nSeveral years after I arrived in Beijing, I was out for dinner one evening with a close\nChinese friend. My friend is a remarkable woman. If you ask how China has gone\nfrom poverty to prosperity in record time, it is partly because of people like her. She\nhad studied in the Chinese educational system, had moved overseas and mastered\nthe technical arts of economics and finance, and had returned eagerly to help in the\nconstruction of modern post-reform China. Nearly any time the government had\nsome new and difficult financial problem to manage, she would be shuffled into the\nnervous hands of some baffled Minister or Vice Premier. She had, in her various\nactivities, helped put the Chinese stock exchange on its feet, rebuilt bankrupt banks,\nand had overseen the construction of China’s first sovereign wealth fund. Though\nonly a few years older than me, her unique skills and absolute loyalty meant she had\nseen much of the development of China’s speed-train economy – part miracle, part\nnear accident – from zero-distance range.\nAs she and I were finishing dinner that evening, a door opened to a private dining\nroom near us in the restaurant. Chinese often eat out in private rooms, and the best\nrestaurants are usually warrens of well-appointed secret spaces, a reminder that in\nChina door after door after door leads to ever more secure sanctums—think of the\nnested power architecture of the Forbidden City. When the door near us opened, a\nstream of senior Chinese party figures paraded past, hovering around an intense,\nsquare-jawed and smiling man who was soon to become one of the most powerful\nfigures in China. As this man walked past, he nodded hello to both of us. I asked my\nfriend once he had left: “How do you know him?” I expected her contact with senior\nleaders on financial matters would explain the connection. Her answer surprised\nme.\n“We both,” she said, “have the same Master.”\n7\nI had only been living in China then for about four or five years, so I was still a bit\nsurprised to learn in this unusual way about what I would later come to know – and\nsee and even experience myself – as the spiritual life of China’s communist officials,\nparticularly those at the absolute top of the system. The Master my friend was\nreferring to was Master Nan. Though he was largely unknown outside of China – I\nam sure you had not heard of him until a few pages ago – in China he was an icon.\nAfter his return to the mainland in the 1990s, his books about Buddhism and\nphilosophy sold millions of copies. His lectures are watched on DVDs and the\nInternet, and he owns a fond fame that reaches across generations and transcends\npolitics or art or philosophy. You are as likely to find a copy of his book on the desk\nof a university President as stuffed into the back pocket of a tea-server in Chengdu.\nAs you can imagine, when my friend first introduced me to the idea of someone like\nMaster Nan serving as a spiritual mentor to the figures struggling to master this\nhuge country, figures I had met and worked with in the brutally rational business of\neveryday life in a modernizing China, it raised all sorts of questions. We both have\nthe same master? But in China, one thing you discover pretty quickly is that honest\nunderstanding of anything isn’t achieved by asking lots of questions, particularly not\nthe direct sort. Yun Men had it right: Ten thousand kinds of clever talk get you\nnowhere meaningful. But with her one sentence, the dinner conversation, which had\nbeen moving pleasantly enough through the eddies of China’s politics and\neconomics, passed into deeper water, where it has stayed in the years since.\nMaster Nan’s particular passion, I learned that night, was a branch of Chinese Ch’an\nBuddhism that had, about 1000 years ago, provided the seeds for the Japanese\nschool of “instant illumination,” known as Rinzai Zen. Rinzai is famed in the west for\nasking students to grapple with koans, the sorts of puzzles – “What was your face\nbefore your were born?” or “What is the sound of one hand clapping?” or just “Mu!”\n– that can never be approached or answered by reason alone. They require nothing\nbut pure, trained instinct. Koans are not like math problems or word puzzles, so\nmuch as questions that have to be answered with your whole soul. We don’t really\nhave an educational concept like this in the west, but the aim of Rinzai meditation\nand learning is to arrive at kensho (jianxing in Chinese), a sudden and complete\nunderstanding of the true nature of the world. Such “instant illumination” marks a\nvery eastern sensibility: Real truth resists the grasp of mere logic. It can’t be simply\nexplained, or taught with words alone. It calls on more immediate feelings, in the\nway we might fall in love or get angry. In Rinzai study, the aim is to tighten and\ncompress your mind with meditation and focus and exercise – and the occasional\nslapping sharpness of a hardwood “enlightenment stick” – as a way to open it, with\nthe goal of instant, blazing enlightenment. In such a moment, all sorts of invisible\nrelations become unforgettably obvious.\nI had been a student of Rinzai since I was 16. So it was that, in the springtime of the\nyear after that dinner in Beijing, I was surprisingly, luckily invited to Master Nan’s\ncampus.\n3.\n8\nIt is often said that during the days when Master Nan’s Lake Tai campus is open for\ntraining, when hundreds of rich and connected elites from all over the Chinesespeaking\nworld converge there, it is the best networking spot in the country. But on\nthe weekend of my first visit, the Tai Hu center was closed to outsiders. Only about\nten of us were present. We were all, together, students. On our first morning we\nwalked to a large hall overlooking the lake and sat down quietly on benches and\nmeditated for three hours. And on our first evening, Master Nan sat with us during\ndinner, looking young and vital and 20 years short of his 92, barely eating. Above the\nbridge of his nose, I noticed, was a small marble-sized bump. This is the mark that\nemerges, according to Buddhist tradition, when your self-cultivation and meditation\nhas led you to deep breakthrough, when energy begins to slip out of your head at\nthat “third eye” spot and into the world, leaving a little bump as evidence.\nAs we finished dinner, Master Nan turned the conversation to me and asked me to\nspeak about what was on my mind. In later years I would learn this was his habit, to\nhand the floor over to his guests for a bit – whether they were politicians or\nindustrial titans or innocent visitors – before entering into his own reflections. He\npursued me with careful questions, his voice purring with a thick coastal accent. The\nquestions seemed removed sometimes from my main points, but I quickly came to\nsee them as needles. (“When he uttered a phrase,” it was said of Yun Men, “it was\nlike an iron spike.”) Many of those present were jotting notes: Whatever Master Nan\nthought important, his students felt, must be worth putting down.\nI knew that the records of Nan’s lectures and discussions were often circulated by\nemail. With subject lines like “Understanding This Chinese Generation” or “Master\nNan Answers Questions About Chinese and Western Knowledge,” they were realtime\nmaps of the usually invisible dance our daily lives do with history and\nphilosophy. We live now, of course, but Nan was always aware that we lived within\nan historical flow too, in a particular moment amidst constant change. Remember\nthat the foundational text of Chinese civilization is the 2500-year old Yi Jing, The\nBook of Changes. If Westerners are accustomed to consistent historical, Chinese\nbegin with the idea of a flux of forces as the only constant. A world of ceaseless\nchange means that valuable, useful education is less about facts than about the\ntraining of a vigilant instinct for reaction. 2 It was a version of this same aim that was\nat the heart of Nan’s teaching, and that made his ideas so magnetically appealing.\nThe circulation lists on his lecture notes were the Chinese equivalent of a roster that\nincluded Ben Bernanke, Colin Powell, and Warren Buffett. They reflected the\nbreadth of curiosity about his ideas, and the hunger to understand and digest\nchanges in China and the world. “I just had a very senior leader here,” Nan told me\nduring a visit several years later. I had seen the high security at the compound and\n2 A world of ceaslesee change: See Francois Jullien, The Silent Tranformations\n(London: Seagull Books, 2011) 70, and David Hall and Roger T. Ames, Thinking from\nthe Han Self, Truth, and Transcendence in Chinese and Western Culture (Albany, N.Y.:\nState University of New York Press, 1998) 150\n9\nthe military cars whipping in and out all day. “He asked me what books I could\nrecommend to understand this period we are living in. I said, ‘I could give you some\nbooks, but you wouldn’t understand them.’” Nan laughed. The iron spike. “This can’t\nbe understood by reading!” Nan was trying to educate his students in the original\nprinciples of Ch’an: a set of psychological and physical tools to reveal deeper\npatterns in the world.\nAfter wearing his guests down with relentless dinner-time questioning that first\nnight I was at Lake Tai, Master Nan began to offer his views of our age. What he saw,\nhe explained, was a world pressing too hard on a fault line. We faced, he said,\nchoosing his word carefully, an “ephocal” quake. We were at a moment when the\nriver of change he had spent a lifetime feeling out was about to shift its course over\nthe landscape, drowning many of the reliable, old routes. The origins of this change\nwere buried in the very things we hoped might, in fact, save us from shock: money,\ninformation, speed. “People are now constantly connected to computers and\nmachines, and this is changing the way they think. People just cannot make sense of\nwhat is happening,” he said. “There is no respite. The world is going to go faster and\nfaster in this regard.”\n“In the 19 th century the biggest threat to humanity was pneumonia,” he continued.\n“In the 20 th century it was cancer. The illness that will mark our era, and particularly\nthe start of the 21 st century, is insanity. Or we can say, spiritual disease.” He paused.\n“This next century is going to be especially turbulent. It has already begun. And\nwhen I say insanity and spiritual disease, I don’t only mean inside the minds of\nindividuals. Politics, military, economics, education, culture and medicine – all these\nwill be affected.”\nI could sense the logic behind Master Nan’s argument. The industrialization and\nurbanization of the 19 th century had packed much of the world into Dickensian\nurban pits. These became petri dishes for pneumonia. Too much industry and\nurbanization, too fast. The 20 th century of plastics and artificial, untested, unsafe\nmaterials had torn away at our genetic base and worsened cancers. Too much\nscience, too fast. In our age, in the 21 st century he felt a wasting disease would be\ncarried by information, by cell phones, by packets of data, by every bitstream we\njacked into our lives – and it would go right for our brains. Our institutions and our\nideas about power and stability would fall apart. The remapping of force that the\ninformation revolution represented was a profound, destructive shift – what Nan\ncalled a jieshu, the Chinese word for a rupture in the fabric of human history. In such\nan era, the once reliable old habits would become useless, even dangerous. All that\nwould matter were your instincts. Frankly, all you would have would be your\ninstincts because no existing map could guide you through a completely new\nlandscape. In fact, the existing maps, should you stubbornly continue to use them,\nwould lead you along dangerous paths towards catastrophes you could not even\nimagine.\n�\n4.\n10\nThe dining hall around us was dark as Nan finished his discussion that night. At our\ntable we sat in a pool of dim light and waited on the Master as he considered his\nnext thoughts. I knew that some of what drew China’s great minds here to dinners\nwith him was a sense that those old ideas of Chinese philosophy – born in an age of\nchaos and dating back to a time before rational calculation and scientific progress –\noffered hope. I asked Master Nan where he would begin on a quest to understand\nthis age and how best to prepare. How to cultivate oneself?\n“You know you can’t just understand this easily,” Master Nan said sharply. He was a\nlittle angry with me, I could see, for asking such a direct question – and he was also\nusing the Chinese teaching technique of taking students through a range of emotions\nto accelerate their learning. Chinese philosophers believe we learn differently\ndepending on how we feel, so a teacher making a student scared or insulted or\nproud is often just an educational tactic. Nan was working on my humiliation bone\nnow: “This isn’t like some idea I can sell you and then you can just go and use,” he\ncontinued, his voice rising. “This is going to be hard.”\nMaster Nan inhaled on his cigarette and waited a moment. “If you work, though,\nmaybe you can be like Su Qin,” he said, “the man who wrestled 20 years of peace out\nof 300 years of war.” Su Qin was the hero of the Warring States period during which\nChina collapsed into total chaos. He is remembered today, two thousand years later,\nfor the way he had penetrated the madness of his age and how he found there\ndeeper fibers of truth that he lashed into a stable peace. “Su Qin started as an\nidealist. He failed.\n“You know, Su Qin was humiliated in trying to advise kings. Even his kin were\nembarrassed. His sister and mother refused to let him return to the family home. He\nwas in so much pain over this embarrassment that he sat in front of a desk and read\nevery book of history he could find for seven years. He tied his long hair to a beam\nabove his desk so that if he fell asleep it would hold his head up. Sometimes he\nwould stab a knife into his thigh to keep awake.” Nan’s voice was rising, his speech\npicking up pace. “But in the end, he learned. Su Qin learned. You should study him. If\nyou do this, if you are sincere, if you work hard, if you learn these ideas, you can\nunderstand. Can you be that disciplined?” The room was dead quiet now. No one\nlooked at me. In the silence, one of the guests passed around a plate of cut fresh fruit\nand cherries and sweet dried dates.\nNan’s relentless, intense Ch’an Buddhism sort of enlightenment, delivered only after\npainful years of carbon-crushing intellectual intensity, expressed a clear ambition:\nTo learn to feel through invisible relations and balances and to construct something\npromising and hopeful on the other side. Nan’s long sessions of mediation or sword\nplay, his furious pursuing philosophical dialogues that reduced students to an\nembarrassed sweating state, these were all aimed at sharpening a blade so as to\ninstantly carve at the energy flows of our age. Did “spiritual illness” really linger\nahead of us? What sort of tragedy did that suggest? What was it that, hair tied to the\n5.\n11\nceiling, penknife jabbed into his leg, Su Qin had learned in those long, effortful years\nof study? What secret had he penetrated? What sort of education had he finally\nreceived at the end of his humiliations and breakthroughs? He had mastered the\nenergy of his age – and the exact right sensibility to use it. Might we, Nan seemed to\nbe asking, do the same?\n7.\nFaced with the mad unsettling of his world during the Industrial Revolution of the\nmid 19 th century, the German philosopher Friederich Nietzsche once mused that\nsurvival and greatness would depend on having what he called a “Sixth Sense”, by\nwhich he meant a feeling for history. Surely, he felt, an instinct for ancient balances\nand truths would provide a guide rail of sorts as the world lurched into a new age,\nalong an uncharted road. 3 If you could say “This has happened before” or “This is\nhow we got to where we are,” Nietzsche believed, it was the first step towards\nknowing where to go next. Nan and Kissinger knew the need for something else for\nour age as well, for a different instinct. It wasn’t just about knowing your history or\nfeeling the real possibility of human progress or tragedy. Rather it was about feeling\nout the roots of the present in a certain way. All of our ideas – from how we love to\nwhat we think of politics – are taken from the feedback and experience of our lives,\nfrom what we’ve seen and done and felt and learned. We are the sum total of our\nexperiences, in this sense. But what to do if changes happen at some deeper,\ninsensible level where the old ideas and instincts, where the tools of sight and smell,\nof feel and taste and hearing don’t fully answer? What to do when we are confronted\nwith what we’ve never experienced before? Never even dreamed of, perhaps?\nThis book is the story of a completely fresh way of feeling our world. By this I mean\na sensation that is as newborn as the lively sense of connection, of freedom, of\nelectric uncertainty and hope that come with the knowledge that we are unboxing a\nnew age. If Nietzsche’s era demanded a feeling for history, our own age insists on a\n3 Surely, he felt: Nietzche describes the “Sixth Sense” in Beyond Good and Evil in the\nfollowing way: “The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly the order\nof rank of the evaluations according to which a people, a society, a human being has\nlived, the ‘divinatory instinct’ for the relationships of these evaluations, for the\nrelation of the authority of values to the authority of effective forces): this historical\nsense, to which we Europeans lay claim as our specialty, has come to us in the wake\nof the mad and fascinating semi-barbarism into which Europe has been plunged\nthrough the democratic mingling of classes and races—only the nineteenth century\nknows this sense, as its sixth sense. The past of every form and mode of life, of\ncultures that formerly lay close beside or on top of one another, streams into us\n“modern souls” thanks to this mingling, our instincts now run back in all directions,\nwe ourselves are a kind of chaos. In the end, as I said before, ‘the spirit’ perceives its\nadvantage in all this.” See Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche and Rolf Horstmann. Beyond\nGood and Evil Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future, (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2002), 224.\n12\nsensation alive to the pull of constant, instant connection. This Seventh Sense reacts\nto what none of our other senses can notice, to the subtle undercurrents of a\nnetworked age. That moment of first connection you once had – to a computer, a\nfriend, a fast-moving financial product, a miracle medical cure, an idea, a smashed\nup sound – is like the first time you looked at a Matisse painting or heard Beethoven\n(or Orbital). It switched on a new sensibility. But you have probably had – or will\nshortly – another moment. This is the instant a cold and creeping chill hits you,\nstarted by the uneasy sensation that something you’ve done has been recorded or\npredicted or watched and manipulated in some way you’d not quite imagined. That\nsome strange force from a great distance has slammed into your life. This feeling is\nthe sudden shudder of a bill come surprisingly due: You wanted to be connected?\nOkay, here’s the cost. And the addition on both sides of the ledger, the massive\nbenefits of our links and the rather terrible potential of those same threads, is still\nbeing settled. We can say at least that the sum of all the revolutions wrought by the\ninstant mingling of the world’s soon-to-be connected billions with each other and\nwith machine intelligence, biological innovation and the tremors of a globalizing\nworld will be, to use Master Nan’s word, “epochal.”\nMost of us find ourselves torn now. Not just between future and past; not merely\nbetween the habits and loves of a slower age and the ceaslesss promise of\nsomething fast and new. We are trapped, as well, between two groups. An older\ngeneration now in power, blind to the laws of networks and connection, uses old\nideas to battle problems of a connected age and makes them worse, ever faster.\nTerrorism. Financial chasms. Environmental imbalance. At the same time, an\nemergent class of powerful technologists fingers more influence than perhaps any\ngroup in history. Machines watch, learn, think and increasingly control nearly every\nelement of our lives. This digital-age group understands networks; but if they have\nideas about virtue, philosophy and justice, (mostly they don’t) these feel susbsumed\nby their confidence in networks and control. Each group pulls at the legacy of the\nEnlightenment – our liberty. And, so far, we’ve no way of defending ourselves. No\nnew instinct for life in this still unfathomable age of connection. The Seventh Sense\nis a feeling for just what constant connection means – and the start of (finally) a\nconfident knowledge of how to construct our future and protect ourselves against\nwhat is even now descending upon us. A consciouness exists in the world, Master\nNan would say. It extends over borders, across differences, between people. And it\nbecomes, on networks now, visible in new, powerful and hopeful ways.\nWhat I mean by a sensibility is really a kind of instinctive notion, a way to sense and\nthen use the energy flows of our age that hovers perhaps just below what the\nrational mind alone can tell. Master Nan used to recall a famous story from the 2500\nyear old Daoist masterpiece Zhuangzi, about the butcher who worked for a famous\nand powerful Duke. One day the Duke saw the butcher cutting meat, his blade\nsinging and moving with almost no effort. “Ah, this is marvelous. Imagine such\nmastery,” the Duke said. “How have you achived this?” he asked. “What I follow is\nThe Way,” the butcher said, referring to the idea of a spiritual force, a natural energy\nwhich Daoisim tells us infuses everthing, from trees to the human heart. “When I\nstarted butchering, all I could see was parts of the ox itself. After three years, I could\n13\nsee the the whole ox. Nowadays, I meet the ox with my mind and spirit rather than\nsee it.” 4 The butcher was not looking at his work; he was feeling the energy of the\ntask. “A good cook goes through a knife in a year, because he cuts,” the butcher\nconcluded. “An average cook goes through a knife in a month, because he hacks. I\nhave used this knife for nineteen years. It has butchered thousands of oxen, But the\nblade is still like it's newly sharpened.” He was cutting not with his knife, but with an\ninstinct – and the result was the highest form of mastery: accomplishment with\nnearly no effort. This our our aim: To see the world with our mind, not our eyes. So\nmuch of what will affect us in the future is invisibly stashed on a connected\nlandscape we’re only now learning to feel. It will emerge from the complex, adaptive\nsea of links expanding around us. We must tune our own instincts for this power,\nwhich will make our moves almost effortless. The ever-sharp mental knife laid upon\nthe thick challenges of a new age.\nThere will be moments ahead for all of us – the most dangerous or terrifying or\nwonderful ones – in which things will happen that none of our old ideas or senses\ncan help us understand. The truly new. We’ve had previews of such moments often\nenough in recent years: innovative devices, surprise attacks, unexpected and\npermanent economic quakes. A cracking of the old physics of wealth and power is\nunderway around us, largely invisible to most of us, except perhaps in its strange\nand unnatural effects: everywhere terror, instant billionaries, the failure of ideas\nand institutions, millions of migrants loosed and drifting across old borders, but\ntethered to deeper fields of connection, data, and ideology. The Seventh Sense is the\nability to see why this is happening. And to use what you see. This is not merely\nabout brain power or sharpened intellect; it’s about a gut reaction. Just as the\ndemand for liberty or industry was once invisible and insensible to an age\naccustomed hundreds of years ago to feudal, agricultural habits, so we’re likely blind\nto urgent pressures of our own. Surely you’ve felt this creeping anxiety yourself, the\nexciting nausea of movement coming from you know not where? The ability to sense\nand feel the deeper chord changes of history has, always, been the decisive mark of\nleadership and success in revolutionary periods.\nConsider, for instance, Charles, the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel who faced\ndown Napoleon on the fields of Jena in what is now central Germany in October\n1806. Brusnwick-Wolfenbuttel was then 71 years old. He was considered one of the\nmost courageous soldiers of his age, with a record of astonishing victories. He\nlooked over the sun-dappled fields along the Saar river on that fall day and saw\nnearly certain victory in the coming battle. He had Napoleon outmatched two\nsoldiers to one. His men were masters of the subtle techniques of Frederick the\nGreat, tactics that had delivered victory in far more perilous moments. But\nNapoleon, less than half the Duke’s age at 37, stared across the same undulating\nland, the same poised armies and saw in the landscape something completely\n4 When I started butchering: I’ve finessed the always-unstranslatable Zhuangzi.\nSee for reference Burton Watson, Burton, The Complete Works of Chuang Tzu. (New\nYork: Columbia University Press, 1968)\n14\ndifferent and totally, lethally correct: An interlocking set of murderous gears that\ncould be set loose by his artillery 5 .\nIn the course of the French victory the next day Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel was first\nblinded by French musket shot and then bled to death. It was a poetic end. He had\nbeen, like so many of the Generals who would tumble before Napoleon in coming\nyears, absolutely blind to forces perfectly clear and visible and usable to the\nrevolutionary upstart. Napoloen’s European opponents would come to fear and\nadmire nothing so much as the Emperor’s specific, almosty mystical sort of\nbattlefield vision. He could look at a battlefield and see possibilities – certanties, in\nfact – that eluded older, famous men. They named his masterful insight the “Coup\nd’Oeil”: an instant, apprehending glimpse of power waves 6 . He saw forces and facts\nin war that were obscured from his enemies by their own habits of mind and the\nlimits of their creativity. The great Prussian military strategist Carl Von Clausewitz,\nwho was made prisoner by Napoleon during the massacre at Jena, used his time\nlocked up to begin compiling notes for his classic work of Western strategy, On War.\n“Genius,” he later wrote, “rises above the rules.” Mastery of strategy, Von Clausewitz\nexplained, was not merely the result of steely courage, geometric calculation or even\nluck, as earlier writers had figured it. Rather, it was derived from the ownership of a\nsensibility that could discern the secretly running lines of power that made the old\nways instantly irrelevant and appallingly dangerous.\nHistorians who mark out and consider the really long, century by century movement\nof humanity, often divide time into “historic” eras where fundamental, tsunami-like\nchanges wipe clean old orders and other, more sedate periods where time dawdles\nlike a quiet lake. This is the difference between living in Warsaw in, say, 1339 or\n1939. The first period was sober and silent; the second was awfully awake. Historic\nmoments like 1939 are marked by the fact that change comes to find you. It is often\nunavoidable. Your children are pulled into a World War. Your village is torn down.\nYour health is remade by science. The paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called the\nmarch of these snapping changes “punctuated equilibrium,” as the world is jumped\nfrom one state to another – and never turns back. He was largely considering the\nextinction of the dinosaurs, but we find the idea useful in thinking about history too.\nThe Revolution of 1789 in France, for instance, which enabled the massive,\nvolunteer armies Napoleon later brought to his wars, which were of unprecedented\nsize. “Looking at the situation in this conventional manner, people at first expected\nto have to deal only with a seriously weakened French army,” Von Clausewitz\nexplained later. “But in 1793 a force appeared that beggared all imagination.” 7 The\n5 An interlocking set of gears: David Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon (New\nYork: Macmillan Publishing, 1974), 464; For a discussion of this generational\nmismatch, see the essay “������������������”or Dai Xu,\n“Reconsidering the military aspect of great power rise and fall from a cultural\nperspective” PLA Daily, June 8, 2015\n6 They named his masterful insight: Carl von Clausewitz, Howard, Michael, trans.\nClausewitz On War, (Washington: Library of Congress, 1998) 102\n7 But in 1793: On War, p 591 (1984)\n15\nEuropean riots of 1848 were another such example. Or the ideological and military\nsurging of 1939. Our very own age. There is a feeling of this sort of inevitable\npunctuation in what is underway around us now, the insertion of a single period at\nthe end of one era and the first, italicized letters of a new one. Impulses and\nconnections we don’t fully understand and can’t yet control are at play. Our\nimagination is beggared too now. Often. These forces are, we have to confess, wiping\naway one system. But they are also producing another.\nWhat I mean by the Seventh Sense is the ability to see both these old and the new\nworlds around us, to feel too the real and the virtual – and to know power as it flows\nthrough and between each. Rattling one apart. Enlivening another. I don’t mean here\nblinding technological optimism; nor do I mean absurd conservative historicism.\nThe Seventh Sense is the ability to contemplate politics, economics, warfare,\ninnovation, genomics now – really every hot-connected discipline and sense in one\nglance the new and the old power, and of course the fault lines running between\nthem. Connected and yet-to-be-linked. Colliding. Melding. Repelling. Our future will\nbe less an isolated technological paradise than an intermingling of real and virtual. It\nwill not be an age of blacked-out virtual reality goggles like Oculus Rift or the\nblinding and submersive feeling of novels like Ready Player One but, I think, a bit\nmore like a semi-transparent screen, on which real and virtual worlds mash\ntogether. Hololens or Magic Leap glasses that project virtual images on the real\nworld, for instance. Or the feeling of Snowcrash, Neal Stephenson’s masterpiece\nnovel whose charaters move effortlessly between net and city. Maybe even\n(probably most accurately) the game Ingress, in which the reality of streets and\nbuildings and homes was augmented into a giant chessboard and populated by\nhundreds of thousands of us in the last few years. These cultural landmarks matter,\nthey are worth learning about and exploring. They stand out as trailguides to a fresh\nsensibility in the same way Nijinsky’s 20 th century dances or Goethe’s 19 th century\npoetry once did.\nWe flip back and forth between real and virtual in our every day lives now, popping\nour head from screen to street. Our art, our music, our finances – they make the\nsame passage. To see both fields at once, to see the way they blend and pull on each\nother, does demand a new sensibility, of course. And though, eventually, this new\ninstinct will be commonplace, for now at least it must be defined, refined, and\nlearned by each of us. Like Napoleon looking at a battlfield and discovering how to\nspot the violent potential of industrial war. Or, Einstein reaching the deeper,\ninvisible truths of physics as he left Newton behind: “There is no logical path to\nthese laws,” he wrote later of the leaps that had carried him to relativity, “only\nintuition.” 8 This is what Nan was trying to point to; the need to train an instinct for\nthe epochal changes ahead. Whether the future that emerges from our simultaneous\nconfrontation with real and network phenomenae will produce a speed-blasted\ninformation paradise or a terrifying dystopia is hard to say now. That will be\ndecided largely by choices made in the next couple of decades. It will be decided by\n8 Or, Einstein: Einstein, Albert, Essays in Science (New York: Philosophical Library,\n1934), 4\n16\npeople who do have the Seventh Sense. Even, I think, by people who are reading this\nbook.\nWhy start this journey into the churning, still-confusing and affronting world\naround us now by the shores of Lake Taihu? Why begin with the sentiments of a\nslower culture that Master Nan embodied, passed like delicate and still-warm tea,\nwith so much calm in the face of all this urgency? It’s not only because of Master\nNan’s insight that this world is tearing at our minds, that the faster we move the\nsicker we’ll get. It’s something else. The training of an instinct, of a really fresh way\nof looking at the world, demands a kind of calm. Understanding of anything, after all,\nis most durably assembled in slow conversations, in patient probing. It is developed\nas much from brushes with music and literature as it is from any direct, slamming\nconfrontation with the truth. The birth of an instinct requires a rewiring of our\nminds, a reframing of our hopes, and this can only be done at the pace of\ncontemplation. (It’s the best way to keep the fear at bay.) We seek those stilled,\nfreeze-framed moments where we’ll pause amid lightspeed fast networks to think\nabout why they work and just what they are doing to us. Tranquility, for a moment\nat least, in the face of the alternately horrible and wonderful way the world is being\nremade. That’s what you’ll get here, in the following pages. Nan’s model statesman\nSu Qin, knife stabbed into his own thigh and slouched with exhaustion is a sort of\ntotem for us. Knife in thigh. Stop. Think. Even, hard as it may be, wait for the right\npath to present itself. No matter how uncomfortable it may be at times, it is better to\nbe unconventional than conventional in our revolutionary age. This is the only way\nto cultivate a Seventh Sense. The old methods will not teach you a new way.\nLet me tell you what is going to happen: In coming years there will be a struggle\nbetween those who have the Seventh Sense – who are born with it or trained to it –\nand those who don't. New, network forces all around us will take on old, established\nones – they already are – in business, politics, warfare, science. Then – because\nthose who don’t have the Seventh Sense for network power will lose, as anyone who\ntries to stop the future always loses – a new age will begin. This age will involve\nviolent, historic wrestling between different groups with different versions of the\nSeventh Sense.Competing interests and ideals and aims will fire these contending\nforces. Networks will fight networks. Some of the plans of these connected age\ngroups will be good, others evil, and anyhow the winners will be ruthless. Then, and\nthis is where it will get particularly strange and incredible, there will be a battle\nbetween those with the Seventh Sense and the very systems of connection,\nmachines and intelligence they have built. Human instincts laid in competition\nagainst the machine instincts. That struggle? I’m not quite sure how it will turn out.\nBut for now, at least, we can say this: The future sits almost like a cold-eyed dare in\nfront of us. Just try to avoid this!\n17\nChapter Two: The Age of Network Power\nIn which the Seventh Sense reveals a fundamental insight: Connection changes the\nnature of an object.\nSeveral hundred years ago the forces of the Enlightenment and the Industrial\nRevolution, like twin hammers, began working away at the roots of an ancient order.\nThe powerful ideas of liberty, freedom of thought, science, democracy and\ncapitalism – these all layered one upon the other. They washed, like irresistible\ntides, across the institutions and kingdoms and beliefs of Europe and in a process of\nrevolution, of invention, of destruction and creation, they put a period at the end of\none era, and began the very first lines of a new human story. These forces produced\nwhat we know today as the modern world: Trains knit new markets, science tripled\nlife spans, democracy liberated politics. Confronted with this really irresistible\npressure, a gulf opened. The world started to cleave. On one side were the nations\nand peoples that our modern economists would come to know and label as a\n“Convergence Club.” 9 This group mastered and refined and then used the tools of\ntheir era to become industrial, democratic, scientific and rich. 10 They left the age of\nkings and feudal lords, of alchemists and all-knowing priests behind. At the same\ntime, a “Divergence Club” appeared. These nations missed the essential turn. They\nwere trapped. Old ideas, useless habits of power, inescapable history – varied\nshackles held them back from the punctuated shift to a new, more advanced\nequilibrium. Russia, China, much of Latin America and Africa – for them, the leap to\nbeing honestly modern was fatally elusive. Even today, they struggle to catch up.\nWe are now in the earliest stages of a shift that promises to be still more\nconsequential than the one that enlightened and industrialized our world over\nseveral centuries after the Dark Ages. The essence of this shift is best captured by\nthe prodigious explosion of different types of connection emerging around us now –\nfinancial, trade, information, transport, biological – and the innovative combinations\nthat follow these and other fast, fresh links. Modern, highly-connected systems are\ndifferent than those with less connection. And, as we’ll come to see, they are\nparticularly different from those with slower connection. We experience power\nthrough networks now, as once we experienced it through brick-bound institutions\nlike universities or military headquarters or telephone company switches. You can\nno more understand the operations of Hizb’allah or China’s central bank or the most\nvaluable Internet companies today without at least this frank admission: Their\n1.\n9 On one side: William J. Baumol, Convergence of Productivity Cross-national Studies\nand Historical Evidence (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994)\n10 This group mastered: See Joel Mokyr, “The European Enlightenment, the\nIndustrial Revolution, and Modern Economic Growth”, Max Weber Lecture,\nEuropean University, March 27, 2007\n18\npower operates as much through light pulses running through fiber optic webs as it\ndoes in any physical sense. Think of the most influential geopolitical forces. The\nmost lethal militaries. The greatest new commercial or financial efforts. All now\ndepend on and are nearly defined by their fluency with different sorts of connection.\nNetworks emerge when nodes – which can be composed of people, financial\nmarkets, computers, mobile devices, drones or any lively and connectable object –\nlink to other nodes. Networks can be defined by geography, or by language or\ncurrency or data protocols or any of a thousand particular features. 11 People who\nlive in Bangalore, is a network. As is, Switches running DNSSEC protocol on the\nInternet or Businesses transacting in Rupiah. An engineer might say: Network power\nis simply the ceaseless summing, at any instant, of all these bundles of connection.\nReal, physical networks hum magnetically now in cities that now pulse and grow\nwith accelerating, connected speed. New York City is network, in this sense, as is\nBeijing or – in a less evolved way – the Alaskan steppe. So while it’s tempting to call\nthe 21 st Century the “Urban Century”, in fact the billion-people a decade rush into\ncities is a symptom. A larger hunger for the constant knitting of lives together, for\nfresh and efficient connection drives us. 12 Of course completely, powerfully virtual\ninstances of networks exist too: knit webs of computers teaching themselves how to\nread, or the fast, paranoid and careful buzzing of constantly alert cybersecurity\nfirewalls. All of these systems are defined by relations. Their power comes from the\nnumber, the type and the speed of the connections they hungrily establish and then\nuse. Networks don’t merely speed up our markets, our news, or our innovation –\nthey revolutionize the nature of their power. Broad-based interconnection can cause\nand even determine events.\nThese expanding, ever-thicker webs of data and linkage can be mapped, and taken\ntogether they reflect something we are coming to know as “Network Power”. 13 By\nthis phrase we mean not merely the Internet or twitter or crypto currencies like\n11 Networks can be defined: For an excellent overview of networks the following\ntexts are of use: Albert Barabasi, Linked The New Science Of Networks Science Of\nNetworks.

But “Network\nPower” is something larger. It represents a potentially comprehensive grasp, new in\nhuman history and enmeshing billions of connected lives and tens of billions of\nlinked sensors and machines. It is becoming, with every passing moment, more\ncomprehensive: more sensors, more links, more points and more speed. Cascades,\nepidemics and interactions are ubiquitous on all these networks, producing\nunexpected innovation in their collisions: the weaving of genetics and databases, for\ninstance, or of terrorism and mobile messaging 14 . Scientists who study networks call\nthis sort of change “Explosive Percolation,” by which they mean an instant shift in\nthe very nature of a system as it passes a threshold level of connectivity. 15 This\nmelding of nodes into a single fabric is not unlike the linking of water molecules one\nto another as the temperature drops. One moment you have something you can\ndrink; the next you have ice. So: One moment you have a world of simply connected\nusers, the next a billion-person platform like Facebook or YouTube solidifies. One\nday you have tumbling, angry fundamentalists; the next a linked terror movement.\nAnd because the impact of terrorism – which might be best defined as violence with\nan aim of causing psychological impact – depends on connection, exploding the\nlandscape of links instantly expands its effects. 16 The network enables a new kind of\nterror. It changes its nature. Expands its impact. Such elemental phase transitions,\nwhere more means different, appear everywhere in linked natural systems– the\nformation of crystals, for example, of the collapse of an ecosystem when the last of a\nkeystone species is hunted down. They appear on networks too. So you might say: A\nphase transtion lingers ahead of us in our security, our finances, our politics. The\nage we’re entering now will be as different from the age we’re leaving behind as the\nEnlightenment was from the dark feudal era that preceded it.\nThe Enlightenment’s revolution of free ideas and men and trade and capital\ndemanded a new sensibility. Our age is similar. It insists already on a fresh feeling\nfor the power that emerges as a result of connection. There’s an irony here: At the\nvery moment when we might expect ourselves to be most free – liberated by\nwireless connections, by easy jet travel, by never-off communications – we find\nourselves, inescapably, enmeshed and dependent. Mastery of connection turns out\nto be the modern version of Napoleon’s Coup D’Oeil. Connection increasingly defines\nthe most elemental pieces of our lives. The old individualistic, me-first instincts\ndon’t answer as well as they might once have when “me-first” now demands\nconnection of some sort in order to get what you might want: Am education, better\nmedical care, a pizza. What is true for the machines all around us now is true for us\ntoo: We are what we are connected to.\n14 Cascades, epidemics and interactions: Dirk Helbing, “Globally Networked Risks\nand How to Respond,” Nature, 2013, 51-59.\n15 Scientists who study networks: D. Achlioptas, R. M. D'souza, and J. Spencer.\n\"Explosive Percolation in Random Networks.\" Science, 2009, 1453-455.\n16 And because the nature of terrorism: See Anthony Richards, Conceptualizing\nTerrorism, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015)\n20\nCenturies from now, our great-great grandchildren will look back at our age and\nname it as we have named “The Enlightenment.” Perhaps they will call this era “The\nGreat Connection” or the “The Enmeshmnet” or somesuch. They will spot the\nwinners and losers of our age as we do in our own review of history. That distant\ngeneration will identify a new “convergence club” emerging among us now, even if\nwe can’t quite name its members yet. Already we can see lavish rewards\naccumulating to the people and nations and companies who have established an\nearly grip on this new sensibility. They understand and manipulate connective\npower. What they all share is a feeling, as instant and certain as an instinct, for what\nit means to be enclosed, constantly, by ever growing masses of connection. A set of\nforces, invisible to many, is now applying a merciless and grinding pressure to the\nfamiliar structures of an older age.\nThe struggles of our cherished institutions – the US congress, the military, the news\nmedia, our educational system, our once-inclusive capitalism – to achieve the very\naims that they once elegantly and efficiently met is only the visible evidence of this\nshift. Buried underneath their lurching collapse is the real source of this change, a\nnew connective energy. Power is now passing with a rippling, ripping energy from\nold, once-useful people and institutions and ideas and into these new platforms and\nprotocols, built for an age of connection. If this passage has so far only wiped out\nencyclopedias, telephone companies or taxi medallions, it is merely because it is just\nbeginning.\nThe Seventh Sense, in short, is the ability to look at any object and see the way in\nwhich it is changed by connection. This is the essential skill. Whether you are\ncommanding an army, running a Fortune 50 company, planning a great work of art\nor thinking about your children’s education. You need to be able to look at a car, a\nhotel room, a share of stock, a language, a translation machine and say to yourself:\nConnection changes the nature of an object. It changes the nature of every object\naround it. This book is the story of just how and why that happens and of the way in\nwhich an instinct for this power now rests behind the fattest fortunes and the\ngreatest successes of our age. Connection changes the nature of an object means\nconnection changes the nature of your life, of mine, of our government, of the wars\nwe fight and the peace we secure. The heart of the problem ahead of us is not small.\nIt is nothing less than the most significant shift of power balances since the\nEnlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. How high are the stakes? If the\nEnlightenment is our reference, then I think we can say they are nothing less than\ntotal.\nOf all the Seventh Sense ideas, this single concept is the most fundamental:\nConnection changes the nature of an object. A medical diagnostic machine is\nimpressive; one that is connected to a database of information that can accelerate\nand improve or perfect a diagnosis is revolutionary. The act of linking our bodies,\nour cities, our ideas – everything really – together, introduces a genuinely new\ndynamic to our world. It creates hyper-dense concentrations of power. It breeds\n2.\n21\nfresh chances for complex and instant chaos. The emergence of surprise, tragedy, of\nwealth and hope will be more common now than in less revolutionary times. To\nfollow the logic of the French philosopher Paul Virilio, for a moment: The train\nproduced the train accident. The plane produced the plane accident 17 .�Surely we can\ncount on the network to produce the network accident – and many of them. In such\na world the question of what you “have” – by which I mean what you are connected\nto – determines what you “are.” You have friends on a social network. The US has a\ncurrency platform. Some new startup has an artificially intelligent machine. We all\nhave possibilities and vulnerabilities we only dimly understand.\nThe great insight of the Enlightenment was that the nature of an object – a person, a\npiece of land, a vote, a share – changed when it was liberated from old fetters of\ntradition, ignorance, habit or fear. That single shift triggered centuries of disruption,\nof wars, of creativity and great human advance. The world realigned itself. The\nSeventh Sense era will be similar. When we are connected, power shifts. It changes\nwho we are, what we might expect, how we might be manipulated, attacked,\nenriched. It is too early to map with any real fidelity the landscape that will emerge\nas a result, but we can say at least this: The nature of an object, any object, changes\nwhen it is connected. We need to say too: We are relatively early in our age of\nconnection. It’s not just that so much of the world remains to be linked; it’s also that\nthe nature of connection itself is changing. It is becoming instant. It is increasingly\nsharpened and enhanced, we will see, by the use of artificial intelligence. Basic\nconnection is a powerful force; instant, AI-enabled links? You can imagine it must be\nsomething else entirely.\nLet’s take as an example a tool you’re using right now, the English language. Any\nlanguage is an “object” of sorts, a tool whose power depends on how and where it is\nused. Just as widespread use of the dollar or the British Pound or gold – for trade,\nfor finance or for stashing under mattresses – marks a network of economic\nexchange, so English is a mesh for information sharing. When Spanish and Lebanese\nand Russian researchers gather to design a drug molecule, when astronauts talk in\nthe International Space Station, when bankers settle finance policy in the midst of\nyet another unexpected crisis, they are using a powerful, standardized, shared tool\nthat makes their work possible and efficient. English in this role, like French before\nit, has an appealing leverage: The more people who use it, the greater the incentive\nto learn it.\nBut when we think of English in a network sense, we see it is more than simply an\nobject. It’s a means of connection, something that information scientists call a\n“protocol”. You may know the word from the realm of diplomacy, where protocols\nritualize and decide everything from where the President sits at a dinner to how a\nletter must be addressed. In technical terms a “protocol” is also a rulebook too.\nSome network protocols you may have heard of – HTTP, DNS, SWIFT all serve as\nlinks in this sense. They translate digital bits into organized web pages, secure\n17 To follow the logic: Paul Virilio and Philippe Petit. Politics of the Very Worst: An\nInterview by Philippe Petit. New York: Semiotext(e), 1999\n22\npackets or financial vouchers. Protocols embody shared rules. Their subtle, decisive\npower is to place each bit of data in a reliable, predictable order, just as diplomatic\nprotocol might seat ambassadors at a negotiation. “Protocol,” the theorists\nAlexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker have written, “is a system for maintaining\norganization and control in networks.” 18\nIn a world of older, more traditional power distributions Americans might worry\nabout a day when another language, another “protocol” in a sense – Chinese or\nSpanish, say – would pry the central connective role away from English. Protocols\nare hard to change, of course. So many people have learned English; whole systems\ndepend on its use. To suddenly switch the world’s airline pilots, bond traders and\ncomputer programmers to Chinese or Spanish would hardly be worth the immense\ncost and the colliding confusion such a transfer would demand. But it’s here where\nthe Seventh Sense axiom, that connection changes the nature of an object, gives us a\nnew view. For the first time, as a result of connectivity, a once unimagined\npossibility exists: rapid, real-time machine translation. Fast, ubiquitous network\nlinks mean that the central role of English is boiled away by another language than\nby a connected, intelligent network skin. “Good morning,” is less likely to be\novertaken by a greeting from some other language as it is to be effortlessly, invisibly\ntransmuted into “� �” or “Buenos Dias.” Fast access to a great translation\nalgorithm will be more important than the ability to speak English (or Spanish or\nChinese). Even as an advocate of learning other languages, it’s hard not to feel that\nthe American parents now plowing their children urgently into Chinese classes are\nmissing the point. Fluency in any second language in the future will be an arcane\nspecialty. Better to teach the kids how to build an AI, or to debate the moral\nreasoning of Confucius and Socrates than how to order dinner. The machines will\ntake care of that. Power in a connected age will pool, then, not in the mouths and\nminds of English speakers, but rather into the hands of anyone who controls the\nbest translation server.\nConnection has changed the nature of several objects here: The language itself, the\npeople who use it – pilots, commodity traders, machines, you and I. You can see how\nthe ability to design, build and turn on (or off) the fastest, smartest, most connected\nlanguage machines becomes a nexus of fresh power. What will replace English isn’t\nSpanish or Chinese, but a protocol. This sort of specialized data-pipe will permit\ninstant, always-improving translation. It will become as crucial to the operation of\nthe global economy or research laboratories or entertainment companies as English\nnow is. More crucial, in fact, because these machines will enable vast new\ncommunication links with a fidelity far better than pidgin-level speech. They will\nconsider not only what we say, but what they suspect we mean to say in the quest of\never clearer discussion. The pre-network instinct of Fear Chinese! Fear Spanish! is\nthe wrong one. As is the idea to teach the world Chinese or Spanish as a source of\npower. Rather, Can we control this turbo-smart connected language platform? is the\nright question. So many of the threats we worry about today have been similarly\n18 “Protocol”: Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker, “Protocol, Control, and\nNetworks” in Grey Room 17, Fall 2004, pp. 9\n23\nsimplified and misplaced. Fear deflation? Fear ISIS? Fear the RMB? What we should\nbe contemplating with great care is the connected skein that enmeshes us and all\nthese connected knots of worry. We will see, over and over again, the way in which\nconnection shifts, alters and even destroys the way an object moves and lives. The\nmain point here is straightforward: New links, exploding into operation around us\neverywhere now, alter everything from how terrorists operate to how investments\nperform. And the failure to spot, use and understand that fact will be a source of our\nbiggest future tragedies. Do you feel the global economy is more stable now than in\n2008? Are we less susceptible to terror now? Is your data more secure than in the\npast? What do all these problems have in common?\nPerhaps we’re targeting the wrong things.\nIf the idea of a Seventh Sense for our changing world is quickly apprehensible\nenough – It’s that gut feeling that seems to animate wild new businesses or attacks or\nrisks – the deeper logic will be harder to name and master. We will have to consider\nthe most ancient instincts for power and safety in light of the very newest\ntechnological experiences: speed, machine intelligence, really constant connection.\n“Instead of thinking in terms of surfaces – two dimensions – or spheres – three\ndimensions – on is asked to think of nodes that have as many dimensions as they\nhave connection,” the French philosopher Bruno Latour has written of a network\nage. “Modern societies cannot be described without recognizing them as having a\nfibrous, thread-like, wiry, string, ropy, capillary character that is never captured by\nthe notions of levels, layers, territories, spheres, categories, structures, systems.” 19\nFamiliar borders, like the ones dividing science and politics or military power and\ncivilian safety begin to erode when everything is linked. Computing machines and\nnetworks were once locked into usefully narrow silos, unconnected: banking,\nmedical monitoring, power grids. In the past you could mark them as having\n“levels”. But now they overlap and inform each other, meshed into that stringy\nsurface Latour describes. 20 The Seventh Sense is a feeling for just how this world\nmight be navigated; how those fibers might be pulled and yoked to new purposes.\nThis multitude of interwoven links is why networks and their pieces spill now even\ninto the non-digital elements of our life, from how we grow our food (with GPSguided,\nself-driven tractors) to how we fight our wars (from a distance, using\nconstantly connected drones.) As a result, many of the technical choices we’re about\nto make will be strikingly political. Who has access to what data? Where is the line\n3.\n19 “Instead of thinking”: Bruno Latour, “On actor-network theory: A few\nclarifications,” In: Soziale Welt47 369-381\n20 Now the overlap and inform: Richard Mortier, Hamed Haddadi, Tristan\nHenderson, Derek McAuley, and Jon Crowcroft, “Human-Data Interaction: The\nHuman Face of the Data-Driven Society”, Social Science Research Network (October\n1, 2014)\n24\nbetween human choice and machine intelligence? Why is one computer system\nbetter than another? These decisions – and the people who make them – will\ndetermine power distributions. They will reverberate through our future with the\nsame constant noise as the Bill of Rights, the Magna Carta, the Analects or the Koran\nstill do. The real contests ahead will be over networks, and we will come to\nunderstand in this book how these struggles will unfold and how to fight them – but\nkeep in mind that this means, in fact, a deeper conflict. A fight about values.\nNetworks are like any organized system; they reflect the aims and ethics and habits\nof the people who build them. The price of meshing so many different aims and\nsensibilities, hopes and hatreds, will be costly. When Nan said that really, fully\ngrasping our world would be expensive this is what he meant. Particularly if he’s\nright that we’ll all be going half mad under the pressures of constant connection as\nwe try to make the shift. We will pay with our old ideas, our current fortunes and – if\nwe’re not careful – our safety.\nEngineers know this idea that network design shapes the real world as “Conway’s\nLaw.” 21 Melvin Conway was an early AT&T systems designer who noticed that the\norganization of any connected telephone system had an impact on the communities\nor offices it touched. Who could call who was a kind of power map. The physical\nworld, Conway realized, could be shaped and influenced by something other than a\nphysical force; it could be reshaped by information flows, by connection. The\nexpansion of airline routes to Indonesia, for instance, was a network design change\nthat tilted real-life economic patterns. New flights enabled tourism, manufacturing,\ninvestment. In our connected age, the design of research studies, voter databases,\ngenetic information sharing networks, financial webs – all of these will create\nbumps in the surface of our every day lives. 23 The way in which phones or data links\nor mobile devices are tied together changes the way we act when we use them or\nwhen we handle them to touch each other, even if the design of these systems is\ninsensible to us most of the time – the way a marble under a carpet might create a\nsurprising bump. Networks can organize themselves in many different ways. And in\nthe choice of layout, or the evolution of that layout in response to pressures of profit\nor technology, a great deal can be decided. “When you decide what infrastructure to\nuse for a project, you're not just making a technical decision,” the programmer and\ninvestor Paul Graham has written. “You're also making a social decision, and this\nmay be the more important of the two.” 24\nYou might ask: What drew tens of millions of people to watch live as Steve Jobs\nunveiled some new Apple device in the last years of his life? Of course, partly it was\nthe cool technology, the warmly charming charisma of the man. But something else\nwas at work, I think. What Jobs was unveiling atop those black-backed stages over\n21 Engineers know this idea: Melvin E. Conway, “How Do Committees Invent?”\nDatamation, April, 1968.\n23 In our connected age: Barbara Schewick, Internet Architecture and Innovation,\n(Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2010) Chapter 1\n24 “When you decide what infrastructure to use”: Paul Graham, “Great Hackers”,\non paulgraham.com July 2004\n25\nthe years as we waited for him was nothing less than whole new worlds, connected\nlandscapes that emerged entirely from systems Apple was secretly breeding. He\nwasn’t merely introducing a phone; he was changing how we were going to\nexperience life. “Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that\nchanges everything,” Jobs began his famous rolling introduction for the first iPhone\nin 2007. “In 1984 we introduced the Macintosh. It didn't just change Apple. It\nchanged the whole computer industry. In 2001 we introduced the first iPod. It didn't\njust change the way we all listen to music. It changed the entire music industry.”\nApple devices were cracking open paths to whole new worlds in this sense. The\ncompany develops an app for podcasts; a new media form is born. It builds an\narchitecture for video calling; our relations to each other deepen a bit. What Jobs\nwas presenting was new and – until that very instant – unimagined universes of\npossibility that we’d all explore. No wonder the world tuned in.\nWhen we speak of “architecture” in a digital sense we mean the design of the inside\nof a computer – how the chips link to each other – or the layout of a phone system,\nthe mechanics of a block-chain or encryption tool, or the ethereal construction of a\ndatascape so it can be better used to train artificially intelligent programs. These are\ndesign choices that, just like the ones about where to put a door or a freeway,\nconclusively decide and shape movement. They affect speed. Politics, social norms,\ntechnological needs – these and other forces all shape the architecture of digital\nsystems. But –and this is where a new sensibility comes into play – the\narchitectures, in turn, touch and twist politics, social norms and technology. Instant\ncommunication, social webs, fast-spreading news – all of these forces redound\npowerfully on the real world. They affect how we think and act. And, as a result,\ncontrolling these connections is a profound source of power. It’s also true that\narchitectures and designs dropped into different places have different results: Think\nof how an open computer system plopped into the Middle East might be used\ndifferently than one placed in the American Midwest.\nIt was these sorts of vibrations, the ones made by power pulsing through certain\nforms or networks in history, that led the Orientalist scholar Karl Wittfogel to his\nfamous “Hydrological Hypothesis” in the last centrury. Ancient agrarian societies –\nEgypt or China, for instance – developed political orders that were decided by their\nneed for large scale irrigation, Wittfogel explained. Without water, these societies\nwere dead. Without control of that water? Exposed to constant chaos. Chinese\ndynasties tumbled and Egyptian prosperity collapsed as unexpected, unpredicted\ndroughts and flooding tore them apart. Taming water became the aim of all politics.\nAn unusual centralized effort emerged. It screwed these scattered, nomadic\nsocieties into a tight, enduring and largely effective authoritarianism. Wittfogel\nargued that the “irrigation societies” of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia, and South\nAmerica all reflected this link between survival and water control. Power pooled in\nthe hands of what he called a “Hydraulic Bureaucracy”. China’s ”Yu the Great”, for\ninstance, rose to power around 2800 B.C. because of his skills in throttling the\nunpredictable and deadly Yangtze flows. “Contrary to popular belief that nature\nalways remains the same,” Wittfogel wrote, “nature changes profoundly whenever\n26\nman, in response to simple or complex historical causes, profoundly changes his\ntechnical equipment.” 25\nControl of water in those ancient ages and control of information in our own are not\nso different. We are in the midst, after all, of a change in our own “technical\nequipment.” We should read Wittfogel with one eye on our own age, particularly his\nwarnings. “Like the tiger, the engineer of power must have the physical means with\nwhich to crush his victims,” he wrote of those older orders. “The agromanagerial\ndespot,” he said of the masters of those connected water systems, “does indeed\nposses such means.” We should ask: Are we watching the emergence of an\ninfomanagerial despotism? Who controls the dataflows we rely on now? The\nprotocols?\nIf we want to earn an honest understanding of how power works now, we need to\nbegin by looking under the carpet in for the marbles, in a sense. We need to touch\nand follow the networks themselves, observing their construction and flow as\nWittfogel once traced the transmutation of ancient water systems into the politics of\nan earlier age. We too need to go down, inside the connected systems of our era\nbefore we can come back up and begin, confidently, to act. That journey won’t\nalways be easy because it will require us, as we’ll see, to consider some ideas that\nmake no sense using our current way of thinking. But, remember: The idea of a\ndemocracy sounded like a laughable joke to hereditary heads of state until the 18 th\ncentury – Let the peasants vote for what they want? The implications of our new\nnetworks will set uncomfortably against many of our own habits and biases – or at\nleast what we’ve been told our habits and biases should be by an older generation.\nBut once we have mastered this new instinct, there will finally be a day after which\nwe will look at the world and really feel the new logic at work. We’ll be Napoleon,\nnot Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel. And from that day on, everything will honestly be\ndifferent.\n4.\nWe are still early in this age of network revolution. It was less than 50 years ago,\nafter all, that the first digital communication switches emerged. Today, devices,\nplaces, people – are all losing what we might think of as their innocence of isolation.\nThe “Internet of Things” will expand the range of connected devices – phones,\nrefrigerators, heart-lung machines – from 10 billion today to 50 billion in less than a\ndecade. And even with 50 billion connected points only 2 percent of the world’s\npeople and devices and locations will be linked 27 . The analysis of this linked space is\na young discipline, younger even than the nearly newborn technologies at play. It\nwas only in the mid-1990s that the first sophisticated studies of “network science”\n25 “Contrary to popular belief”: Karl August Wittfogel, Oriental Despotism; a\nComparative Study of Total Power (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1957)\n27 “The Internet of Things”: See “The Zettabyte Era – Trends and Analysis” from\nCisco Systems (San Jose) 2015\n27\nbecame technically possible. They have since become essential, as crucial to our\nnetwork world as the first maps were to explorers centuries ago. Fundamental\npapers, by now-legendary researchers like the mathematicians Steven Storgratz and\nAlbert-Lazlo Barabasi or the biologist Simon Levin, identified simple laws running in\nsingle networks. The Internet, financial markets, jungle ecosystems and even our\nown brain connections were found to exhibit similar, often surprisingly common\nhabits.\nUnfortunately, most of our leading figures still think in terms of disconnected\ndangers, of risks that can be reduced to nouns: Atomic bombs, fundamentalists,\nhacks. To be sure plenty of these sorts of dangerous nouns confront us now. But the\nsharpest edges of our problems come from the fact that these nouns are part of\nnetworks, which spring them into connected, surprising action. Computers,\nairplanes, derivatives – they snap and break systems when connected into\ncascading, fast threats. When Master Nan spoke of spiritual illness, I think this is\nparticularly what he meant. Total confusion about our world, followed by all the\nemotions of the lost: anger, denial, irrationality. “A commander in chief,” von\nClausewitz wrote of an older age of land warfare, “must aim at acquiring an overall\nknowledge of the configuration of a province, of an entire country. He must hold in\nhis mind a vivid picture of the road-network, the river-lines, and the mountain\nranges without ever losing a sense of his immediate surroundings.” 28 This sort of\ncommand mastery is still relevant in an age of networks. It is as important for the\ndesign and operation of our economy, our politics, our data and our security as it is\nin considering problems of war and peace. But who of our current leaders holds in\nhis or her mind such a vivid map of the ethereal and essential networks running\naround us now? Who owns that subtle overall knowledge and then acts with the\nconfident sensibility such wisdom would produce?\nAt this early moment in a new revolution, our leaders are blind. It’s not simple\ntechnical fluency that eludes them – though this is among the most embarrassing of\ntheir deficits. It’s that avoiding cyber accidents, controlling the spread of nuclear\nweapons, handling global warming, stemming fast financial crises, restoring\nequitable economic growth – all of these puzzles yearn to be tackled with a new\nsensibility. Not least because often they are produced by a fresh set of links and\ninstincts. These problems linger not as independent fractures on a solid base, but\nrather as markers of spiderwebbing, connected cracks pressing out on knotted up\nnetworks. It is only by tackling them with network ideas that we can hope to make\nprogress. That the rise of ISIS and the forces of global income inequality are driven\nby the same laws can only be understood with a knowledge, or better an experience,\nof connected power. Our leaders are preparing us to fight expensive new wars we\nneed not fight, to confront enemies who might best be regarded as partners – even\nas they flail at the to corrosive problems of a new, emerging order simply because\nthey can’t see or feel the essential links of power that are, even now, making the\nfamiliar dangerous and the dangerous familiar. “We got to know the nature of\ncalculating by learning to calculate,” the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein\n28 “A commander in chief”: Von Clausewitz, p 110\n28\nobserved in his “On Certainty” at the end of his life. 29 So with networks. We will get\nto know their nature by learning to use them. By watching what they do, observing\nthem in their surprising movements. We know at least already that puzzles like the\nfuture of US-China relations or income inequality or artificial intelligence are simply\nnot addressable with traditional thinking because they occur on a network surface\nnow. Old-style ideas about each of these will likely lead us down dangerous paths.\nOur leaders today are, as a result, imperiling us in ways they can’t even understand.\nHonestly, these figures are not mentally prepared to fight any sort of battle on this\nlandscape. They probably never will be.\nI’m not saying effective leadership now demands you know what “the instantiation\nof a class” in object oriented programming means – or that you master the technical\nroots of some other crucial, philosophical idea of connective design. But a feeling for\nthe laws of networks, for the normalness of connection and the pressures that it\nproduces is essential at least. That the terrorists of ISIS or the founders of gaming\napp companies are better at growth hacking – the subtle art of using data,\nconnection and instinct to breed massive virtual communities – than our own\ninstitutions or our leaders should unnerve us for a couple of reasons. First, because\nit demonstrates a mastery of new power tools that move with astonishing speed,\nassembling nation-sized movements and forces in incomprehensively brief periods\nof time. But we should also worry – and this is as crucial – because that fast pace is\ncolliding with a set of slower-moving instincts, institutions and people who still\ncontrol substantial levers of power.\nAt the same moment in time that many of us are alive with the joy of being around\nsomething that is beginning, most of our leaders are locked sadly or with terror into\nthe ending of something else. Same exact moment. Different instincts. It reminds me\nof Virginia Woolf’s novel of transitions, The Years, when the once-commanding\nColonel Pargiter finally passes away, liberating his daughter Eleanor into a world of\nadventure even as the change dooms Crosby, the family’s long-serving maid. “For\nCrosby, it was the end of everything,” Woolf wrote. “She had known every cupboard,\nflagstone, chair and table in the large rambling house, not from five or six feet\ndistance as they had known it; but from her knees as she had scrubbed and\npolished; she had known every groove, stain, fork, knife, napkin and cupboard. They\nand their doings had made her entire world. And now she was going off, alone, to a\nsingle room at Richmond.” 30 The people now lamenting the decline of television, of\nnewspapers, of a disconnected age, who are baffled by constant connection or apps\nof the moment or machines that learn should be given their quiet moments with the\nold structures. They knew that world from their knees, built and maintained it as\nmuch for us as for them. Elements of that slower unconnected era must be\n29 “We got to know the nature of calculating”: Ludwig Wittgenstein, On Certainty\ned. G.E.M. Anscombe and G.H.von Wright Translated by Denis Paul and\nG.E.M.Anscombe, (Oxford: Blackwell 1969)\n30 “For Crosby”: Virginia Woolf, The Years, (New York: Harcourt, Brace &\nJovanovich, 1937) p. 216\n29\npreserved. But, also, we must move on. These people will never grasp the\nopportunity that lingers in front of us now.\nThis book is not, in any event, written for them. It is written for those of us who are\ninheriting the possibility of their inventions, the price of their errors. And it is aimed\ntoo at the people and the generation who are coming to power and who are – in\nsome senses—already in power, even if they don’t appear to be just yet. By this I\nmean the cohort bred into the age of connected acceleration; the first generation of\nleaders and students and warfighters and entrepreneurs to not find the digital\nstrange, but to find it natural and curious and wonderful in its power. It is written\nfor those who will have to manage machines that are smarter than humans,\nnetworks that move faster than we can calculate, and cascades of chaos and conflict\nand creation as this new era settles in. It is for anyone too who has ever begun to\nspeak about the strange tensions of our age, who has begun maybe with the lines,\n“Maybe I’m sensitive or something, but…” as they feel the tickle of their own lives,\nminds and cells increasingly intertwined, electrified. It is written for those afflicted\nwith an aching feeling that we’re being torn apart. Pulled into foolish conflicts and\ndangerous failures by old figures who don’t understand this age. Pulled into\nsacrifices of liberty and freedom by young technological wizards who can’t balance\nthe miracle of their cold inventions with our hot, human needs for freedom and\ncontrol.\nBut I should say too that this book is not, either, a full-throated endorsement of the\ntechnological elite. Yes, it’s wonderful that we are at the beginning of a new period.\nBut it’s not quite right to say that where the network age begins, the old one ends. In\nfact, that's a dangerous conclusion. To begin with we’re at an extremely primitive\npoint in our understanding of networks, comparable to where economics was in the\n1800s or medicine centuries ago. We have a small, modest collection of tools to\nanalyze and think about and consider the complex physics of a networked world.\nWe barely understand the operation and evolution of many single networks today –\nand really only sort of grasp one or two types of design with any real depth. But\nnetworks of networks? Instant networks? Artificially intelligent ones? We have\nbasically no laws or experience with these yet.\nThe headlong rush ahead into a world of constant connection will, of course, be\nbalanced, resisted, braced against, undermined, fought and manipulated. Networks\ntouch everything, remember? The idea that such elemental control – of you, of me,\nof our finances or our nations – would move with anything less than a few\nexplosions is naïve. Revolutions don’t occur quietly. Consequently, the very thing\nthat makes many of the greatest tech minds of our age magnificent – a sense of\nunstoppable determinism, a disregard for history, a slavish and instinctive urge to\nfollow what we’ll come to know as a Seventh Sense – is a bit of a disadvantage at\ntimes. I know many of these men and women; their iron certainty is only a bit more\ndazzling than the success they have had in building something from nothing in a\nhuman instant. But that confidence in the new leads already to crushing collisions\nwith the sorts of older ideas – privacy, localism, slowness – that echo throughout\n30\nmankind’s history precisely because they touch in subtle ways on the human heart,\non what it means really to live.\nA friend of mine who runs one of the leading technology firms told me of the\nunnerving realization that the most important figures at the firm were under 25 –\nand no senior person had much of an idea about what they were doing. This is an\ninversion: Usually in a society the most power accrues to those with the most\nexperience, and judgment and perspective. Today, tremendous even decisive\ninfluence clusters in the hands and machines of a young caste whose very fluency\nwith the norms of a revolutionary age blots out a whole set of important\nconnections, a group that instinctively feels networks but is deaf to the music of\nphilosophy, history and even tragedy that should inform the operation of so much\npower. To love risk, to love creating and building – this is fine. Wonderful even. But\nit’s also not enough.\n“It happens that programming is a relatively easy craft to learn,” the MIT scientist\nJoseph Weizenbaum observed in the 1970s, as computers emerged into academic\nlife. “Almost anyone with a reasonably ordered mind can become a good\nprogrammer with just a little instruction and practice. And because programming is\nalmost immediately rewarding, that is because a computer very quickly begins to\nbehave somewhat in the way a programmer intends it to, programming is very\nseductive.” The mistake, Weizenbaum warned, was to think that easy programming\nof a machine was really a predictor of anything other than getting a machine to\nfollow commands. It didn’t mean easy programming of a complete operation. Or of\nscience. Or, godforbid, to think you could easily program the world. Programming,\nhe warned, “appeals most to those who do not yet have sufficient maturity to\ntolerate long delays between an effort to achieve something and the concrete\nappearance of success. Immature students are therefore easily misled into believing\nthat they have mastered a craft of immense power and of great importance when, in\nfact, they have learned only the rudiments.” 31 Tempting as it may be to call for our\nworld to be turned over to entrepreneurs or technocrats, to let their tools of wired\nefficiency tear with a fast disruptive enthusiasm into our politics and economics, the\nreality is that the world (thankfully) does not respond like a cold machine. That\ndelay between an effort to achieve something and its realization that Weizenbaum\nmentioned, it’s the essence of being human. The delay is filled with worry, hope,\ndebate, exploration, error, success. In short, it’s a hitch that should never be ground\nout of our system, no more by technology than by authoritarian or totalitarian or\nfundamentalist doctrines that have ever promised instant solution to any probem.\n“Just let the entrepreneuers do it” or “Just let the machinces do it,” is no more a\nsolution than “Just let the Nazis handle this,” could have been.\nSo this is our dilemma: Old, white-haired, network-blinded leaders (and young\nfigures who think like them despite their age) pull us from Washington and other\n31 “It happens that programming”: Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and\nHuman Reason: From Judgment to Calculation, (San Francisco: W.H. Freeman 1976),\n276\n31\ncapitals and traditional power centers into a world where their ideas and policies\nconstantly fail. They don’t understand networks; never will. At the same time a new,\nrising generation lashes us into connected and amazing meshes. We welcome this\nconnection. Centered in Menlo Park or Seattle or Zhonguancun or Shenzhen, these\nfigures understand networks perfectly, but not yet much else. Old and new, each\ngroup works anyhow on our freedom. We are pulled dangerously between these\nforces. Problems seem to get worse. What we need to find is a way out of this trap. A\nfusion. A blended sensibility of both the edgiest ideas of connection and the most\nunshakeable and brutal and inarguable requirements of power. This is the Seventh\nSense. It is our only possible protection.\n5.\nIn the last century, as the economist Fredrich Hayek watched Europe both struggle\nagainst and flirt with the then-appealing ideas of Nazi and Soviet socialism, he\nmarked the fundamental conflict of his age as the one between individual liberty\nand central planning. Recall that at that moment in history, the 1930s, America and\nmuch of Europe were in deep depression, their political systems struggling. The\nrapid growth in the USSR and Germany looked awfully appealing to many. The\npolitical stability of totalitarian ideologis had a certain placid charm in some\nquarters. But, Europe was, Hayek argued, walking nothing less than a road back to\nserfdom. Was man happier, better off, more justly fulfilled by the chaos of a market\nand democracy or in the orderly machine of authority, of clicking heels and\nmachines? Hayek voted with his feet. He fled the Nazis in 1938, and he worried for\nthe rest of his life that in the attempt to manage the risks of free markets and minds,\nthe Europe he loved was running into socialism. “Is there a greater tragedy\nimaginable,” Hayek wrote, “than that we should unwittingly produce the very\nopposite of what we have been striving for?” 32\nHayek thought two safety catches of might protect mankind from the totalizing\ncontrol habits of Soviet-style thinking: First, an unkillable human instinct for\nindividual freedom, the squirm humans have always shown under the boot of too\nmuch authority. And, a second protection he thought, would be the really terrible,\nabsurd inefficiency of centrally planned systems. No bureaucrat, no economist,\ncould possibly out-perform the productive chaos of a market or an election in the\nlong run Hayek felt. Finding the right price, matching supply and demand – it was\nimpossible to think this could be done by some technocrat in a room somwhwere.\nThis was what markets were for. This is how they encouraged profit, free-thinking,\ninvention. Chuchill’s famous line, that “Democracy is the worst form of government\nexcept for all the others,” contained a certain truth: civilizations, yoked by\ndemocratic and market rules, reached more durable outcomes than despots or\noligarchs. Hayek, as we look at his judgment now, was correct. People wanted to be\nfree; the dream of central planning collapsed under its own weight with the USSR in\n1989.\n32 “Is there a greater tragedy”: F.A. Hayek, The Road to Serfdom (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1994),\n32\nIn our own age, a fundamental conflict lingers as well. This is the struggle between\nindividual liberty and connection. We have to ask a version of Hayek’s question: Are\nwe happier, better off, more justly fulfilled through ceaseless linkage to the fast\nsystems all around us? The appeal of constant connection is not a mere economic\nfact. It’s become a feature our personalities and psychologies and even the\nbiochemistry of our brains. To be disconnected, in so many senses, hurts. And while\nthe human twitch for freedom remains as alive as a protection for us all, Hayek’s\nsecond safety catch is eroding. Networks of deep connection, speed and intelligence\nwill be powerfully more efficient than central planning; they know more than any\ncentral bureacrat might have. And they may yet be even more productive at times in\ntheir connection and intelligence than our existing structures or markets or\nelectoral systems. Think of the way centralized, linked dispatch systems make a\n“sharing” economy of on-demand cars and rooms available in ways the market itself\ncould not. Similar alluring evolutions lie ahead in medicine, in finance, in politics.\nThe temptation to throw all in for some sort of technological political fusion, one\nthat promises better returns on our time and money in exchange for our liberty, will\ngrow. When we depend so much on connection for our identity, our work, and our\nsafety how far from John Stuart Mill’s line from On Liberty might we tread: “Over\nhimself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.” 34 Are we\nsovereign over our own bodies and minds? Over the machines? This is not a puzzle\ntoday’s power class can or should touch. They may accidentally lead us to disaster.\nHayek’s fear, that in pursuing one end (freedom) leaders would secure its opposite\n(tyranny), is what we should share. The tools of the network age are ripe for misuse.\nIn some senses, they are built for misuse: They are opaque. They are blindingly fast.\nThey seduce and enmesh us with their new power. They demand, as a result, new\nsensibility for their final control.\nThere are many ways we will explore the Seventh Sense. The rise and fall of startup\ntechnology companies or terror groups or epidemics will lead us. We will examine,\ncarefully, the tensions of a network age to understand where the cracks are coming\nfrom, and where new ideas are emerging. But I’m trying at least to write a bit with\nthat challenge of Master Nan in mind. If we are, really, facing an ephochal change\nthen we should handle the problems of our era with particular care; we should\nstudy the opportunities with real urgency. Two hundred years from now when the\ngreat companies and billionaires and revolutionaries of our age are crushed down\nbelow the horizon of history, it is the massive movements of states and populations\nthat will remain, with their awful or wondrous traces. Will we live in an age of war\nor peace?\nIs that something we can actually decide?\n34 When we depend so much: John Stuart Mill, On Liberty and the Subjugation of\nWomen, (New York: Penguin Classics 2007) 19.\n33\n34\nChapter Three:\nWar, Peace, Networks\nIn which The Seventh Sense reaches towards the questions of war and peace and\npower that will flavor our lives, like it or not.\n1.\nOne afternoon in the fall of 2009 I received an unexpected call from the Pentagon.\nThe US was, then, nearly a decade into the wars of Afghanistan and Iraq. Each, in its\nown way, possessed a strange and shifting character, the sort of dim premonition of\na greater violence that has always most unnerved warriors and politicians. The old\nsoldier’s saying – Fear chaos as much as the enemy – seemed to animate, constantly,\nthe progress of these two fights. Once, before I gave a speech to an audience of\nnewly promoted one-star generals in 2010, a four-star general pulled me aside for a\nmoment. He explained that I’d be speaking to a crowd of officers who had come of\nage pacing the murderous streets of these wars, watching soldiers under their\ncommand killed by an often invisible enemy. “You have to remember that these men\nhave been seared, seared, by a decade of combat,” he said. The best American\nmilitary minds had tried, with characteristically direct and relentless energy, to box\nthe wildness of these wars. In books and papers and thousands of patrols, through\nmillions of hours of language training, and endless risky nights, they had tried. It\nnever quite seemed to work. There would never be a durable sense of mastery. The\nwars, which appeared a certain and unfairly tilted fight to American victory at the\nbeginning, had run longer than any in the nation’s history. They were engines of\nchaos and fear.\nThe American Marine Corps General Victor Krulak once observed, “The war you\nprepare for is rarely the war you get,” and you could find this phrase whistling\nthrough the years of American combat after 9/11 35 . One of the lessons of both Iraq\nand Afghanistan – and of the post-World Trade Center wars generally – was that the\nPentagon and the fighting services had been unready for what they faced. Soldiers\nhad arrived in Baghdad with forest-colored uniforms, thin-skinned transport, tankled\nbattle plans – all wrong and mostly dangerous. The most feared weapons system\nof the era told you something of the tone of the new millennium’s wars: $50 to $100\nImprovised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Hidden smashups of dynamite, duct tape,\ncellphone detonators and as much stubbly, impaling iron as could be found. They\nwere impossible to deter. Rapidly deadly. The IED threat, one officer later reflected,\n“is a contemporary example of conventional militaries being confronted with a\ntactical surprise with operational—if not strategic—implications.” 36 Like so much in\n35 The American Marine Corps General: Victor Krulak, “A New Kind of War”, in\nFirst to Fight: An Inside View of the U.S. Marine Corps (Bluejacket Press, 1984) 179\n36 The IED threat: Andrew Smith, “Improvised Explosive Devices in Iraq, 2003-09:\nA Case of Operational Surprise and Institutional Response” Letort Papers (Carlisle,\nPA: Army War College April, 2011) 9\n35\nour age, small-sized problems were spilling rapidly into crises of strategy. One hot\nbattlefield instant – an explosion under an armorless truck, say – could freeze the\noperations of a billion-dollar division. Nearly everyone begins to ask, sometimes out\nloud: Why did that happen? Followed pretty quickly by: What the hell are we doing\nhere? The little bombs were shaking more than the Humvees.\nWalking into the Pentagon, one is struck by cascading sensations of immensity and\nvolume and, frankly, gravity. Surely, you reflect, there must be someone here with a\nplan for everything? But there was not; there is not now. Yet the massiveness, the\nineffable historical density and weight of American power, is so breathtaking that its\nfrequent impotence in the face of a changing world represents a particular and\nunforgettable and, well, searing shock. The soldiers who had experienced those cold,\nfailing nights at the edge of superpower rippled with unease. This was the slim\ncomfort of life inside big, old and lamed structures confronting the fast, blithe and\nunstoppable future.\nBy 2009, with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq settling into a low boil, America’s\ngenerals again began wondering what other cracks were spreading around the\nworld. The Unknown and the Future seemed to have an uneasy parallel meaning.\nThe diplomats worried about this too, of course, but with soldiers dying every day,\nthe questions had a particular urgency for the military. The top of the command\nchain asked incessantly about what they might be missing. What fissures were\nrunning even through their own building, masked by its scale but waiting quietly to\nmake their best plans look foolish and dangerous? And: How they could possibly\nconfront this world with 30% less of what they had a decade ago? They made a few\nphone calls. I received one of them.\n2.\nIt was hard not to notice, if you picked up one of those incoming queries from\nWashington and were asked to draft your views on how this uncertain world might\nbe approached, that one of the main aims of the American military in recent years –\nreducing the number of terrorists – appeared to be backfiring. This was an irritating\nfeature of many global problems. In spreading market capitalism ever wider, the\nworld was also digging an ever wider moat between rich and poor, for instance. In\ntrying to make the world modern with more connection we were, we found, lashing\nourselves to some very unmodern risks. And in waging the most expensive war on\nterrorism in human history, the US was uneasily discovering that it was creating\nmore terrorists. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had sketched the nature of\nthis puzzle in an October, 2003 memo with acid clarity. He asked: “Are we capturing,\nkilling or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas\nand the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?” 37 Though\n37 He asked: Donald Rumsfeld, memo, 16 October 2003, available at\nglobalsecurity.org.\n36\nthis was a simple question, nearly fifteen years into the wars it was still hard to\nanswer. There were a lot of dead terrorists. There were also a lot of new ones.\nAs the war against terrorism had progressed in the years since 2001, it had\nproduced at least this: a huge amount of data. Inside the Pentagon, analysis teams\npoured over records of phone calls and text messages. They examined maps of\npersonal relations, and studied granular statistics about who had been killed and\nwhy and when. All of this information went into targeting computers and databases,\nand what became more and more apparent with each passing year was that the\nspread of terrorism after 9/11 looked like nothing so much as the spread of a\ndisease. This was, at first, no great insight. After all, revolutionary ideas, dangerous\nideologies or just plain panic often look like epidemics. But what was shocking as\nyou studied the Pentagon numbers was the speed of this infection. Disease\nepidemics, even the most virulently aggressive ones like Ebola or drug-resistant\ntuberculosis, move at the pace of human contact; they can be watched and blocked\nand even quarantined. But the contagions associated with terrorism were warpdriven\nto a pace well beyond what the soldiers and analysts could match or even\nfully monitor. “Is our current situation such that ‘the harder we work, the behinder\nwe get?’” Rumsfeld asked in 2003. 38\nTo be constantly behind. This was a commander’s nightmare. Among other things it\nwas that sense of never quite catching up that had so seared the new generals in the\naudience of my speeches. But it seemed to be an inescapable reality. One day a guy\nin Baghdad would figure out how to make an Explosively Formed Penetrator (EFP) –\na sort of pipe bomb that becomes a flying chunk of red-hot steel and can smash\nthrough a tank from 100 yards away – and ten days later the same design of\nprojectile would take out an official thousands of miles away in rural Afghanistan,\nbefore US troops had had a chance to update their defenses. 39 Behinder. An\nAmerican commander would arrive in a new town in Iraq, receive a briefing about\nwho he could really trust, and discover a week later half of them were showing up\non terrorist call logs. Behinder.\nThe Americans knew why this was happening. The data made that clear enough. The\nproliferation of roadside IEDs, for instance: Obviously there was Al-Qaeda Institute\nof Technology, no central IED academy where bomb makers could gather to safely\nstudy trigger design or leisurely swap placement ideas. 40 Such a place would have\nbeen flattened by a Tomahawk or a drone within hours of its discovery. And though\ntomes like Tarek Mahmoud el-Sawah’s famous 400-page guide to bomb making\nwere often picked up on raids, they were out of date. (El-Sawah’s tips included\n38 “Is our current situation”: Rumsfeld 2003 memorandum as above\n39 One day a guy: Anne Stenersen, “’Bomb-making for Beginners’:Inside an Al-\nQaeda E-Learning Course”, Perspectives on Terrorism, Vol 7. No. 1 (2013)\n40 Obviously there was no Al-Qaeda Institute of Technology: Matthew Bolton,\n“From minefields to minespace: An archeology of the changing architecture of\nautonomous killing in US Army field manuals on landmines, booby traps and IEDs”\nPolitical Geography 46 (2015) p. 47\n37\nthings like using Casio watches as timers.) No, the force at work was buried inside a\nnetwork of personal and technological ties, sometimes explicit, other times almost\nethereal in their nature until they were made real in a blast. By 2011 you could peel\nback some corner of the web and find sites like Al-Shumukh’s Special Explosives\nCourse for Beginners, where dark diagrams were uploaded, debated, refined and redrawn,\nlike some sort of hobbyist site for car bomb geeks 41 . Deeper still, encrypted\nchatrooms and messaging services pulsed invisibly, firing off real-time tips (use\naluminum not copper for detonation packs) and suggestions (Marines are easier to\ntarget in the morning). When soldiers said they were fighting a “terrorist network”\nthey really meant it: the force arrayed against them was a self-repairing, growing,\nconstantly-learning web.\nThe Pentagon had, after a few years of confronting this problem, organized a\ntaskforce to deal at least with the IEDs, the “Joint IED Device Defeat Organization”\n(JIEDDO). 42 The group specialized in miraculous engineering. They absolutely lived\nup to the can-do, American spirit sound of their name: Gee! Do! Scientists and\nwarfighters in JIEDDO devised ways to secretly surveil streets so they could fire on\nbomb-planting terrorists. They developed slick, blast-deflecting new designs for\ncars and pioneered armor that could absorb the hit of repeated surprise blasts. Gee!\nDo! was, its motto ran, trying to, “defeat the IED as a weapon of strategic influence.”\nThat made good sense, of course. It was a bit weird that $100 pipe-bombs were\ndisrupting America’s ten trillion dollar national interest. But: Defeating the device?\nYou could sense a limit in the way that mission statement was drawn out. It wasn’t\nenough. Beating the devices wasn’t the same as chewing apart the network that\nproduced them. That was the real target. The devices kept coming with their own\ninnovative, murderous rush, with the gotta-have-it new pressure we know as the\ndesire for the latest phone or video game or flat-screen TV. This raised an important\nquestion: Just what did it mean, really, to beat a network? Could you win? Could you\never get aheader? In fact this is a question that resonates in many parts of life now.\nThat feeling of constantly slipping behind, one that is tied to the heart of a connected\norder, a world where each additional link brings both a rich pipe of new data and a\nsense of what you might be missing or not quite understanding. To be aheader\nmarks, we will see, the nature of a real Seventh Sense. When you can fully feel the\nnetwork, understand its logic, then you can touch and use new sources of influence\nto reshape your business or your career or solve the problems in the world that\n41 By 2011: Stenersen as above\n42 The Pentagon had: On the establishement and background of JIEDDO: “The Joint\nImprovised Explosive Device Defeat Organization: DOD’s Fight Against IEDs Today\nand Tomorrow,” U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Armed Services,\nSubcomittee on Oversight & Investigations report November, 2008; “IEDs: the\nhome-made bombs that changed modern war,”, IISS Strategic Comments Volume 18,\nIssue 5, 2012.

The war-or-peace dilemmas of foreign policy are an essential case\n– when they go wrong, they hammer all of us. And we can see in the ripples of global\npower ideas that are of use in nearly any sphere. How, for instance, to fight a\nnetwork. The struggle of JIEDDO is, in a sense, similar to something all of us face\nnow: Old vs. new. In any event, in the case of the IEDs, here was the most powerful\nnation in human history, backed by hypersonic missiles, always-on radars, and\nendless jet fuel that found itself unable to stop a group of half-educated and\npromiscuously backwards terrorists. You had to ask: What was wrong? And did the\nfailure suggest something even deeper about the position of the dominant national\npower of the era? About the nature of our age?\n3.\nA few days before Christmas of December of 1787, Thomas Jefferson sat down in\nParis to write a letter to James Madison. 43 Madison was on the other side of the\nAtlantic, in Philadelphia, and struggling with refinements to the new American\nconstitution, which had been drafted in the spring and summer just passed. The two\nmen were frequent correspondents. They wrote to each other with an easy\nfamiliarity, revolutionary to revolutionary. Jefferson was then 44, and had settled\nhungrily into his role as the American minister in France, “violently smitten,” as he\nwrote, by the charms of The Continent 44 . Madison was 36, twenty years removed\nfrom the election of 1808 that would elevate him to the Presidency as Jefferson’s\nsuccessor. Madison would become, in a sense, America’s first “Foreign Policy”\nPresident, prosecuting the war of 1812 and negotiating with France for the\nLouisiana Purchase. He was known already, in 1787, as “The Father of the\nConstitution.”\nJefferson begins his letter with a few of the charming literary asides we expect from\nhim: He asks Madison about some nuns he wants to help teach his children, inquires\nafter about a packet of carefully chosen South Carolina rice that has gone missing in\nthe oceanic post, delaying his plans to impress French palates with an American\ncrop. But then Jefferson turns to what he knows must be on Madison’s mind, the\nnew constitution. “I like much the general idea of framing a government which\nshould go on of itself peaceably,” he says, admiring the elegant balance that emerges\nso carefully from the pages of the document. The American constitution, Jefferson\nfelt, reflected political arrangements new in the history of human governance,\nbetween people and power, between states and the center, between agriculture and\ncommerce. He is, he says, “capitaved” by the details of what he has seen.\n43 A few days before Christmas: Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, The\nRepublic of Letters: The Correspondence between Thomas Jefferson and James\nMadison, 1776-1826, (New York: Norton, 1995) Vol 1. pp, 457-459\n44 Jefferson was then 44: Thomas Jefferson and Douglas L. Wilson. Jefferson Abroad.\nModern Library ed. (New York: Modern Library, 1999) letter to Madame de Tesse,\n20 March 1787\n39\nSuch a system, Jefferson wrote, was particularly appealing to him because it\ncontrasted so sharply with the violent shearing of daily life then underway all\naround him in Europe. “France, with all its despotism, and two or three hundred\nthousand men always in arms, has had three insurrections in the three years I have\nbeen here,” he marvels. In fact, France’s revolutionary age was only just beginning.\nThe fall of the Bastille was 18 months away; the flight and death of the King five\nyears off. Paris would soon see a time when one riot a year felt like peace. You can’t\nmiss in Jefferson’s letter, and in the others he exchanged with Madison that winter\nand the following spring, his instinct that the world was changing, that it was being\nriven by urgent new forces, and that America must be positioned for the fresh order\nboth internally and in her foreign policy. Jefferson knows what this new age\ndemands – liberty – and in that spirit he fires off suggestions for Madison. It is in this\nDecember, 1787 letter that he remarks that he “does not like” the absence of a “bill\nof rights”, a hint that led to an adjustment of historic import.\nIt is possible to regard the transformations of politics, economics and military affairs\nover the past centuries, the sorts of bold remakings that tore apart places like the\nBastille or built up instruments like the American Constitution, as emerging from a\nfew crucial periods, the sorts of historic turns that mark moments when power\nmakes an epochal shift. It is striking how, in passing through these periods of\nunthinkable change, America has benefited so much, so fully. The country was, to\nbegin with, born out of the social and political revolutions of the 18 th century. The\nnational liberation that pulled Jefferson from his Virginia farm and into politics was\nthe first of the great, revolutionary movements that convulsed and fractured a\ndozen European powers. France followed America, as did Germany and Italy and\nsoon most of the continent. “The boisterious sea of liberty,” Jefferson called the new\npolitical order 45 . It required a strong stomach. Tempests of accumulated social\npressures – the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution – had\npassed over one ancien regieme after another like powerful waves. America, begun\non fresh land and with new ideas inked onto clean paper, had a natural advantage in\nthe situation of her birth. “I think our government,” Jefferson concluded in his letter\nto Madison, “will remain virtuous for many centuries.”\nA second transformation of global order began in the middle of the 19 th Century, as\nJefferson and Madison’s age ended. Their period had largely been one of internal\nrevolutions, as the nations of Europe realigned their domestic orders. What came\nnext were furious contests between these countries. We might think of this new\nperiod as starting with the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and as running, with\nincreasing violence, through to the summer of 1945 and the end of World War Two.\nIn this era, Europe’s statesmen struggled from one tragically collapsed balance to\nanother. The demands of industry and nationalism and ideology and economy could\nonly be reconciled, it seemed, by war, as if it was absolutely necessary to devour the\nold buildings and the young men before a new order could settle in. The scale of this\n45 “The bousterious sea of liberty”: Thomas Jefferson to Philip Mazzei, The Papers\nof Thomas Jefferson, Volume 29: 1 March 1796 to 31 December 1797 (Princeton\nUniversity Press, 2002), 81-3\n40\nviolence, like the scale of the industry that produced it, defied anything even the\nwisest minds could foresee. Eventually the entire world was pulled into the fire. “In\nthe autumn of 1919, in which I write, we are at the dead season of our fortunes,” the\neconomist John Maynard Keynes wrote after the Paris Peace Conference settled The\nGreat War, dimly aware that an even deader season lay somewhere in the future in\nthe form of another war 46 . During this murderous 75 year run, in the reviving of\nEuropean and then global fortunes, America played a decisive if reluctant role. As in\nthat first period, she emerged richer, more central, and more modern.\nA third struggle, the Cold War, immediately followed the end of this second period.\nThis contest was intensely material and as ideological as any conflict in hundreds of\nyears. It represented a struggle at the level of the most fundamental question of\npolitics: How should life be lived? Two totalizing, uncompromising worldviews were\nplaced in opposition. This 45-year struggle occurred under the threat of nuclear\ndisaster, which gave it an aspect new in human history, the potential for complete\ndestruction. It was possible to find sober-minded theorists pondering problems like\nthis one: “Let us assume that for 10 billion dollars one could build a device whose\nfunction is to destroy the earth,” Herman Kahn wrote in the 1960s, with a spirit\ntypical of his age in his slick, sickly worrisome masterpiece On Thermonuclear\nWar 47 . Yet in this period too, over time, America found herself in an axial role, first\ncarrying one end of the risky fight and then, at the conflict’s surprising and jubilant\nconclusion in 1989, discovering the country was in a position of unprecedented,\nunchallenged power. As with the two earlier shifts, this one had brought with it an\narrangement nearly ideally tuned, yet again, to America’s advantages.\nI mention all this here because while it may be fashionable to speak of the period\njust passed as the “American Century” – and to wonder whose century comes next,\nthe reality is that for two and a half centuries, through some of the most violent and\nwonderful changes in human history, America has had a remarkable run 48 . A senior\nAmerican military official once asked me, a week or so before he sat with the\nChinese President, how best to begin his remarks. “You might say,” I suggested, “that\nAmerica respects what China has done in the last thirty years. To have brought 400\nmillion people out of poverty as Beijing has done is an historic accomplishment. But\nhe must understand that America, particularly in the last intense century, has paid\nin nearly countless dollars and in the cost of hundreds of thousands of American\nlives, to establish an order that has benefited billions. The scale of this\naccomplishment is, by a great measure, historic.” America has been an emblematic,\nprofound force. It has been a country tuned exactly to the needs of her age. Three\ntimes over. Inevitably, the world now asks: Can this continue?\n46 Eventually the entire world: John Maynard Keynes, The Economic Consequences\nof the Peace in The Essential Keynes (Boston: Penguin Classics, 2015)\n47 It was possible: Herman Kahn, On Thermonuclear War, (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 1960)\n48 I mention all this: Henry Kissinger, Diplomacy, (New York: Simon & Schuster,\n1995. See chapter one, and Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (TK\nLondon, 1988)\n41\n4.\nToday the world is entering a new era of revolution. The fourth wave of fresh,\nturbulent dynamics to confront America since Jefferson gamely predicted those\ncenturies of virtuous prosperity back in that 1787 letter to Madison. Driven by\nincredible technological shifts and their economic, military and social implications,\nnew forces are beginning to tear into the established global order. Among the most\nfundamental puzzles now is the problem of an American national mission. What\ndoes America seek to achieve in the world? And how? On what basis will the United\nStates secure the chance to continue “peaceably”, as Jefferson would have it?\nBecause the country plays such a central role, these questions’ answers will affect\nthe calculations of every nation, of every new force yearning for influence. They\nrepresent the crucial background against which we will all live, build businesses,\ntravel and learn. You might feel, sitting in Silicon Valley or Iowa, that such shifts\ndon’t matter to you now, but the cold truth is that the international system is\nunlikely to be arranged, in two or three decades’ time, along the lines that bind it\nnow. Too many violent forces are at work. But must this be a disaster? The\ntechnological demands of our age are forcing a new sensibility everywhere.\nResearch labs, medicine, science, finance and the arts are all hunting now for a new\noutlook. The need for a fresh perspective is also reflected in the biggest of all\nhistorical questions, the one that will decide if we live in an era of peace or one of\nfear, uncertainty and tragedy: How is the international system to be ordered?\nThe idea that the stability of the world system might honestly be at stake right now\nfeels incredible to the generations of Americans born after World War II. A struggle\nfor global order? Real, sharp, bloody nation-imperiling violence? Though we know\nsuch traps are a recurring feature of human history, we have been mostly numbed\nand reassured by the passing of optimistic, fast and prosperous decades. We know\nmostly a blur of IPOs, of rising real estate prices, and confident growth out of every\ncrisis in our memory. Survival and stability have been, fortunately, the least of the\nnational concerns. The sly aside of Jules Jusserand, the French Ambassador to\nWashington for 20 years in the last century, about America’s position in the world\npretty much summed up our views: “On the north she had a weak neighbor; on the\nsouth, another weak neighbor; on the east, fish, and on the west, fish.” 49 Most\nAmericans now alive grew up relying on the durable institutions and ideas and\nstructures built by the World War Two generation. We ride on their roads, fly into\ntheir airports, and use the schools and media they built. We absorbed their habits of\nconsumption, home ownership, optimism and energy. This inheritance produced an\nhistoric level of prosperity. It inspired other nations. And – along with those fathoms\nof fish and friendly neighbors – it assured a position of real world leadership. Since\nthe end of the World Wars, America has fought six expensive smaller wars and lost\n49 The sly aside: Jules Jusserand quoted in George C. Herring, From Colony to\nSuperpower: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776, (New York: Oxford University Press,\n2008), 6\n42\nfive. This record appeared to have had little impact on the nation’s dominant global\nposition; it did little to unnerve a comfortable sense of national destiny.\nMuch of our current confidence can be measured by the astonishing degree to which\nwe embrace the scrambling of even the most elemental parts of our lives, from how\nwe bank to how we drive. Most societies in the past were largely terrified of\ndisruption. If you had arrived in prosperous 17 th century Holland and proposed to\n“disrupt agriculture,” or radically change people’s banking habits, you would have\nbeen lynched. Our age is different. Many of the most unsettling forces in our world\nare ones we encourage, feed and push along. If I had said to you a decade ago – “I’m\ngoing to record all of your movements so you can spend less time in traffic.” – is that\nreally a deal you would have accepted? But if you use a GPS mapping system on your\nphone, you have. That Orwell’s sick prognostication of technocratic life would be\none you’d embrace? That it would describe a desireable feature of network life?\n“You had to live – did live, from habit that became instinct – in the assumption that\nevery sound you made was overheard, and … every movement scrutinized.” 50 If I\nhad told you we were going to build a world wide high-speed data system that\nwould, as a side effect, make it simple for children in London to connect with, learn\nfrom and then join terrorists in Syria – would you have thought that wise?\nThe optimistic bumper sticker of our age – that any disruption is good disruption –\nmarks a wonderful feature of the American character. It is, perhaps, to be expected\nof a nation built by immigrants who overturned their own lives in the hopes of\nsomething better. To pull up and leave home for a land where you did not speak the\nlanguage, knew little of the culture, and faced a blank sheet of the future, demanded\nfaith. You had to believe too: Any disruption is good disruption. But no nation, even\nthe most heroically hopeful, is immune from the forces of history. Edmund Burke’s\nold line, that “every revolution contains within it the seeds of evil,” runs like a\ncounterpoint through the hopeful music of the age now. America’s remarkable spirit\ndoes not make the demand for a national outlook, for an American grand strategy,\nany less real. We’re starting to be aware of just how dangerous this age can really\nbe. In many ways, our very confidence and sometimes blindly certain feeling of\ndestiny probably makes it even more essential that we have a sense, as we rest in\nSilicon Valley or Iowa or wherever, of where we are going, and why.\nThe phrase “grand strategy” is one that carries a particular meaning when we think\nabout problems of global balance. It means the way in which all of a nation’s\npowerful tools of economics, finance, ideology, politics, and other resources can be\nused, together, in the service of security and prosperity. 51 To get the terms right, we\n50 “You had to live”: George Orwell, 1984, Signet Classic Edition (New York: Signet\nPress, 1961), 3\n51 The phrase: For a good general introduction to the problems of grand strategy\nB.H. Liddell Hart, Strategy, (New York: Faber & Faber, 1967); Paul Kennedy, ed.,\nGrand Strategies in War and Peace (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991);\nEdward N. Luttwak, Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace (Cambridge, Mass.:\nBelknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1987); Peter Paret with Gordon A. Craig\n43\nusually talk about “tactical”, “operational” and “strategic” levels as we watch the\ngears of history churning away in war and peace. The “tactical” level is the most\npractical. It’s the choice to use machine guns instead of tanks to secure a street in\nKabul, for instance, or to buy up gold for a central bank or permit high-frequency\nstock trading. Tactics are where policy decisions crunch into reality. The most brutal\nshocks are first felt tactically: roadside bombs or mis-designed, crashing computer\ncode.\nA level above the problem of tactics sits the question of operations. It’s here where\ndecisions are made about just how various levers of power might best be moved.\nShould we send bombers to slow Iranian proliferation or rely on cyber attacks? Will\ntax dollars fix our infrastructure faster than tolls? Macarthur’s landing by surprise in\nIncheon on the morning of September 15, 1950, Operation Chromite, was an\noperational decision. “Within five hours, 40,000 men would act boldly, in the hope\nthat 100,000 others manning the defense lines of South Korea would not die,\" he\nthought before the battle. “I alone was responsible for tomorrow, and if I failed, the\ndreadful results would rest on judgment day against my soul.” 52\nPolicy gets implemented through operations. It is the level where clever bureaucrats\nand parasitic office politicians prey, where they can most easily undermine the\nambitions of visionaries. But it is also the place where inspiration works on the will\nand passion of companies or armies or research labs. Server farms, data mining\nalgorithms, trade treaties—these are the operational chessboards of our era.\nOperations is where the bolt tightening for revolutionary change occurs. It is\nintense, relentless operations that ensure stability in the face of shock or growth or\ncollapse. “The exploding popularity of Internet services has created a new class of\ncomputing systems that we have named warehouse-scale computers,” the Google\ndata engineers Luiz Andre Barosso and Urs Holzle wrote in famous, revolutionary\npaper several years ago as they described the operational revolution that lets\nGoogle serve terabytes of data, instantly, every day. 53 The massive data centers they\nhad built, they realized, are so large that they are nothing less than computers that\nare the size of massive buildings. Solar fields are their power supply; entire rivers\nare their cooling tubes. And they enable nothing less than magic: instant knowledge,\nconnection to distant lands, a constant picture of what humanity knows. This is the\ngrowing, heroic scale of operations now.�\nAbove the operational and tactical levels is what we call the strategic dimension. It is\nhere where overall design is considered and moved. Without it, operations and\ntactics are incoherent. Strategy imagines how whole structures like nations or\nand Felix Gilbert, eds., Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear\nAge (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1986) and Sun Tzu, “The Art of\nWar”, Filiquarian (1986)\n52 “Within five hours”: Douglas MacArthur, Reminiscenes (Naval Institute Press,\n1964), 354\n53 “The exploding popularity”: Luiz André Barroso and Urs Hölzle, The Data-Center\nas a Computer (San Rafael: Morgan & Claypool, 2009)\n44\ncorporations might be directed in the service of really ambitious goals: European\npeace or the fiber-speed transformation of telecommunications or billion-user\nfinancial grids. It’s thin air up at this level, honestly, by which I mean that at these\nelevated heights you see the most ambitious athletes of human power at work: The\nmaniacal CEO, the egotistical statesman, the mad dictator. Hundreds of millions of\nlives are in play; even more in some cases. By a “grand strategy” we mean the very\npeak of this sort of consideration. It represents, in the world of global affairs, the\nconstruction of a strategic idea that suggests how military, diplomacy, markets, and\npolitics might be harnessed, firmly, in service of a singular aim. Grand strategy is a\nbasic stance towards the world. If it works, it liberates creativity and national\nenergy. It sets a clear direction 54 . It protects against the steep price of surprise.\nGrand strategy holds, in a single concept, the nature of their age and our plans to use\nthat nature for the aims – security, prosperity – that gird a nation’s life and decide\nits future. Like it or not, we all live under the umbrella raised by grand strategic\nchoices.\n“Containment” of the Cold War period, “Balance of Power” from Europe’s 19 th\nCentury Age of Revolutions, or the “Tributary Alliances” that shaped a thousand\nyears of Chinese power – these were all big, essential organizing grand strategic\nconcepts. They shaped security decisions for durable empires. Each balanced ideal\naims like freedom or the preservation of dynastic continuity against technological\nrevolution, economic crisis, ideologies and the numberless other forces that can\ncrack empires. Each idea reflected the demands of the age, and as a result each tells\nus something about power in those eras.\nThe Chinese strategist General Liu Yazhou observed a few years ago in a widely\ncirculated essay, perhaps a bit too eagerly, “A major state can lose many battles, but\nthe only loss that is always fatal is to be defeated in strategy.” 55 There’s something a\nbit cold in that line, but it expresses a hard truth. Massiveness and deep\ncommitment to a particular, flawed view of the world can turn strength to weakness\nin a heartbeat. In our connected age this sort of reversal can happen with a\nparticularly devastating speed. In the past, traditional measures of power – tanks,\nairplanes, national wealth – declined or rose as a gradual process. It took years for\nGenoa to fund and build an expeditionary force to gut Venice’s Adriatic designs.\nDecades passed as Germany built her naval fleet. But in our age, such slower-moving\nmeasures are of limited use. Network systems rise and fall with astonishing speed.\nOnce-successful firms in technology, companies like Wang or Fairchild\nSemiconductor or MySpace, found themselves unseated in months, after years of\ngrowth. New firms can emerge as if from nowhere and erase once cherished\nbalances, demolish once strong names. Google unseats Britannica. Ride-sharing\nfirms vaporize taxi medallion economics. “Change or die,” the old computer\n54 If it works: Hal Brands, The Promise and Pitfalls of Grand Strategy, (U.S. Army War\nCollege Strategic Studies Institute, August 2012); Jennifer Mitzen, “Illusion or\nIntention? Talking Grand Strategy into Existence”, Security Studies, 24:1(2015), 61-\n94\n55 The Chinese strategist: Liu Yazhou, “Da guoce” on aisixiang.com (2004)��\n45\nprogrammer’s line, runs on a very fast clock in a world of constant innovation, and it\napplies to nations and ideologies, your habits and mine. Think of General Liu again\nfor a moment: “A major state can lose many battles.” Those five lost American wars\nover the last 50 years weren’t fatal. They wore only a bit on our national pride and\nour position because they weren’t strategic losses. But our next errors, which may\ncome without the firing of a single shot, could be far more costly because of the slick,\nstrategic slope on which we are now moving. “It is one thing to struggle heroically to\nget out of danger,” Liu wrote in another manifesto. “But it’s better to see the danger\nbefore it even begins to sprout.” 56\nSix paradoxes trace the immensity of the gaps we now face.\n5.\nFirst: We find ourselves confronted, almost daily, with an unnerving mismatch\nbetween our interests and our means. The most powerful nation in human history\nfinds itself unable to achieve even simple military and diplomatic goals.\nSecond: A global crisis of faith in our institutions is now under way. No significant\ninstitution, from the US congress to the Euro to your local newspaper, is more\ntrusted than it was a decade ago. Many of our most essential institutions seem\ndestined to be victims to the logic of “forced obsolescence” that makes our phones,\nour cars and our televisions of ten years ago feel like antiques.\nThird: The connected age lets us see and measure, with historic precision, the\nproblems we face – yet we can do almost nothing about them. Global warming,\nwealth inequality, species destruction, nuclear accidents, terror killings – we can see\nall of these in rattlingly sharp detail, instantly, miraculously. Watch the Fukishima\nreactor meltdown! See BP oil leak into the Gulf of Mexico in HD! The rise and fall of\nmarkets, the moves of distant wars, rivers of refugees appear almost as if we were\ntuning into a football game. But we can only watch. “Hey, do something!” we want to\nshout as we see financial or ideological or religious chaos spill towards us. But\nnothing seems to move; and what does move makes the problems worse. This\nimpotence of being “just spectators”, works like a nutcracker on the credibility of\nthe people and institutions we expect to fix these problems.\nFourth: Many new challenges exhibit a worrying non-linearity. Small forces produce\nmassive effects. One radical teenager, a single mis-placed commodity order, or a few\nbad lines of computer code can paralyze an entire system. The scale of this\nwhiplashing grows every day, because the network itself grows, it turns pindrop\nnoises into global avalanches. Dangers, accidents, crises were once local. A drought\nin California was, largely, a drought in California. A slowdown in China hit Shenzhen\nor Shanghai, not South America. Now, as networks overlap and influence each other,\ncrises cascade at a new, stunning and comprehensive scale. And while we know\n56 “It is one thing to struggle”: Liu Yazhou, “Tan junshi gaige yu quojia anquan\nwenti”\n46\neffective foreign policy or politics or economics can’t be improvised, the speed of the\nnetworks now outstrips the velocity of our decisions – even as citizens expect\nreactions at the ever-faster pace of their own connection. Think about the speed\nwith which answers are expected in almost any job; all those pressures are yet more\nextreme at the highest levels of government.\nFifth: Though the changes working through the global order depend generally on\ninnovation rooted in American institutions, corporations and ideas, there is now an\nuneasy sense: This order is slipping from American control. Look back just two\ndecades. Then America stood as the sole superpower, the global leader in finance\nand economics and technology – and embracing other nations into rules we’d\nwritten. Today, allies and enemies alike wonder: Is global order is collapsing? At\nwhat speed? And: What comes next?\nAnd, sixth, perhaps obviously to you by now: We don’t know where we’re going –\nand our leaders don’t seem to have much of a clue either. Though nations are\ncapable of adjusting activities at the tactical and operational levels – devising better\ndrones, sharper monetary policy – we’ve still set no clear strategy. American\nnegotiations are aimed now at small problems, not the heart of the issues we face. In\nwhat area of our national security today do we appear more confident than a decade\nago? What nation does conduct the confident, creative, energetic an global\nnegotiations of the sort that mark a power with a clear sense of direction?\nTaken as a whole, these six paradoxes represent nothing less than the potential\nunbuckling of the greatest power the world has ever seen. And because the whole\nworld is connected to that power, still more of the system may yet be rattled apart.\nWe are surrounded today not only by fish, but enmeshed in a world of connective\nlinks that are the tissue of our real power – and a source of danger. A sense of\ndirection. You have to feel as you look at this rotten, dangerous landscape we’ve\nmade for ourselves in recent years. We need a sense of direction.\n6.\nIn response to these challenges, America’s leading figures are now proposing a\nrange of ideas that don’t honestly resonate with much confidence. Really they are\nhaving a debate about if they should use more of the old style of power or less. What\nthey aren’t doing is grasping the nature of the age. So no clear, imaginative and\ncoherent picture of where we might head yet exists. In fact, as you’re probably\nstarting to suspect, the very best ideas of our incumbent figures may yet make the\nworld more dangerous, may firmly and enthusiastically pull us into connective webs\nof danger and waste and mis-calculation they don't see. With our Seventh Sense\nwe’ll be able to spot and think about many of these dangers in a new, better and\nmore rational way, free from the blinders of habit, but we should know what the\nworld looks like to the blind.\nTwo approaches are predominant among the most respected American elites, who –\nas leaders of the leaders of the establishment represent an important group for us as\n47\nwe consider what not to do. The first approach proposes something known\nappealingly enough as “Smart Power.” 57 The concept was summarized most sharply\nby President Obama in 2014, when he said American policy ought best be guided by\nthis tight precept: “Don’t do stupid stuff. 58 ” And while it is hard to disagree with this\nsort of charming, solipsistic formulation – there’s not a long list of politicians\nsupporting a strategy of “Do stupid things”? – “Smart Power” is no more a foreign\npolicy vision than “Good Weather” is a strategy for farming. It suggests in some way\nthere is no need for a strategy at all. Faced with a problem, just make a smart\ndecision. “I don't really even need George Kennan right now,” Obama remarked at\none point during his presidency, dismissing the need for a strategist of real stature –\nand, by implication, the need for any strategy at all. 59\nSuch a stance reflects an instinct that the great strategic question of our day – the\nfuture – has pretty well been worked out. In such a view of history, all we need to do\nis not screw this up too much. The root of this idea is an absence of a long view of\nhistory and a discomfort I think about the application of cold power. There’s a\nmisplaced confidence at work here, an assurance that American-style power, our\nmodel of politics and economics, is the best, final and only answer to the question of\nhow the nations of the world might be best organized. Americans need, in this\ntelling of history, only patience. The world will catch on. And I suppose that if you\ngrew up in the United States after World War Two, such a vision of the world\ncertainly would be consistent with your own experience. The problem is that such a\ncomfortable posture is at odds with nearly any book of history you might pick up,\nfrom The Peloponnesian Wars to Churchill’s The Hinge of Fate, all of which will\nremind you in the most violent terms that liberty and freedom demand struggle and\ndefense; that epochal changes come whether we want them or not. Also that nations\nthat look invincible can find themselves nearly unwound in an historical instant.\nGreat Britain mastered the globe in 1937; three years later she was gasping for air;\nthree decades later she was an afterthought. “Freedom is the sure possession of\nthose alone who have the courage to defend it,” Pericles told his Athenian audience\nnearly 2500 years ago in as they mourned a full year of war-dead sons and fathers –\nand no peace yet in sight. 60 Or, Churchill, famously: “Never, never, never, never give\nup.” 61 We should be embarrassed to hold “Don’t do stupid things” against these\nmottos.\nAdmiral Hyman Rickover’s famous advice as he surveyed the nuclear navy he’d built\nin the last century has it about right at every level: “To find meaning in life one must\n57 The first approach: Joseph S. Nye, Jr, “Get Smart”, Foreign Affairs, July/August\n2009\n58 The concept was summarized: Jeffrey Goldberg, “Hillary Clinton: 'Failure' to\nHelp Syrian Rebels Led to the Rise of ISIS” Atlantic Monthly, Aug 2014\n59 “I don’t really even need”: David Remnick, “Going the Distance: On and off the\nRoad with Barack Obama”, The New Yorker, January 27, 2014\n60 “Freedom is the sure possession:”\n61 Or Chuchill:\n48\nbe willing to act.” 62 This is as true for nations as it is for each of us. We must be\nwilling to act. It’s easy to be sympathetic to the desire for less action. Nothing we’ve\ndone in recent years seems to be working. But, as we’ll see, that’s because we’ve\nbeen using the wrong tools. Our enemies? They are developing the right ones. They\nare willing, and eager, to act. To travel the world now is to encounter in nearly every\ncapital figures who have a different reading of history or the future of the global\norder. They see the world not as some ready-to-eat American political order but\nrather as a churning, uncertain, urgently worrying vortex. They wonder: What might\nwe build? They look at America’s global leadership with the hungry eyes of an\nInternet startup eyeing an old, unconnected market. “Don’t do stupid things,” is an\ninvitation for these forces to poke at the world, to take risks, and to remind us that\nso much of what later seems brilliant appears stupid or insane when it begins.\nIn the years since “smart power” became fashionable, another proposition has\nemerged from a different group of elite thinkers. It is, in a sense, the flipside of that\nstrategy-free posture of passivity. It was distilled by a well-regarded cluster of\nacademic foreign policy specialists in 2012 as America began withdrawing from\nIraq: “Don’t Come Home America!” they called their essay. As they explained, “The\nUnited States’ globe-girding grand strategy is the devil we know. A world with a\ndisengaged United States is the devil we don’t know.” 63 According to this logic, the\ncountry’s globe-striding posture, while expensive and exhausting and admittedly\ninefficient, is a crucial element of our rich national power. Yes, we spend 15% of our\nGDP on security activities, but we reap far more in return: Access to the best minds\nin the world, a secure life, a culture of open debate and personal liberty.\nThe problem here is that “Don’t Go Home!” feels, for the most part, like a costly\ngroping after something to hold onto. Articles and speeches and policy ideas that\nflow from this hopeful camp have a shimmering and expensive unreality, one that\nAmerican domestic sentiment would be unlikely to support for long and that jostles\nagainst our experience of recent years. Are more aircraft carriers, overseas bases\nand jet fighters really the cure for the dangers we face? The ideas of this group have\nan appealing simplicity, or maybe I should say an appealing familiarity, because they\necho instincts about power that were once true. The energetic engagement with the\nworld they suggest is attractive, but America has work to do at home and – we can\nall see – the ambitious overseas tasks of recent decades have not, in any event, been\nreally finished. Instead of a confident, conclusive, “Job well done!” comfort we still\nsweat with nervousness. What is coming next? After all the blood and treasure, after\n850,000 soldiers in Afghanistan and $3 trillion dollars – we were left with expanded\nswamps. Like “Don't do stupid things”, “Don’t Go Home!” tells us little about the\npicture of world order that might emerge in the future. (It also tips us to this:\nProbably as a general rule no credible grand strategy starts with the word “Don’t”.)\n62 Admiral Hyman Rickover: Rickover speech date TK\n63 As they explained: Stephen G. Brooks, G. John Ikenberry, William C. Wohlforth,\n“Don’t Come Home America: The Case Against Retrenchment” International Security,\nVolume 37, Number 3, Winter 2012, pp. 7-51\n49\nSo we should say it coldly: We have, as of yet, no strategy. We have no shared\npicture of the world as it might be. You. Me. Our leaders. None of us. And the\nexperience of other, fast-collapsed empires should way on us. “The struggle to\nsurvive,” the historian John Darwin has written of the British Empire, “was waged in\nan age of revolution: a Eurasian revolution that cumulatively (but very quickly)\ndestroyed almost all the global preconditions on which the British system had\ndepended since the 1830s.” 64 So in our age. Many of the essential determinants of\nAmerican power are being revolutionized by new, connected forces. The world syste\nwill change in coming years. Our only question is will the changes reduce us as they\nonce shrunk Britain, or will we draw on them to establish a longer, more durable\nsystem. At the moment, in a time of fascinating explosions of ideas and insights and\nconnection, the American foreign policy approach is deeply and strangely unplugged\nfrom these risks and possibilities. The world has changed – is changing profoundly –\nfrom the one in which most students and practitioners of international affairs were\neducated. And here’s the reality: Nothing can stop this change. The last two decades\nhave brought massive and persuasive change in so many disciplines. And in foreign\npolicy? In the consideration of problems of war and peace which, if not handled\nproperly will rain tragedy on every other effort we might have in mind? Not much\nhas changed. Except this: A growing sentiment of pessimism that suggests maybe\nAmerica can’t hold on. Great powers get one century to rule, the logic goes, and\nAmerica’s is now up.\nIt’s not merely that we lack a “China Strategy” or a “Middle East Strategy”, it’s that\nwe’ve failed to discern an overall grand strategy that would produce a coherent\nanswer to the question of what to do about China or the Middle East – to say nothing\nof how those forces might be played off another with clever diplomatic harmony like\ninstruments in a symphony. It is hard to know if this puzzlement represents a failure\nof imagination or of nerve. Does it mark arrogance or confusion? Or just an\nignorance of the profound, revolutionary nature of the forces now at work?\nToday when leading officials remark that their main concern is a rising China or\nrevanchist Russia or that we live in a world where, as Secretary of State John Kerry\nsaid, “terrorism is the principal challenge,” they are missing the point. The\nfundamental threat to American interests isn’t China or Al Qaeda or Iran. It is the\nevolution of the network itself. Constructed of switches, chips, data, code, exploits,\nsensors, AI bots, financial instruments, trade, currency and more, the network is\nitself a weapons system. Its architecture, a wonderfully humming maze of change\nand contagion and instability, determines its terrifying dangers and marks its vast\nopportunities 65 . It touches – decisively – each and any particular problem we would\ncare to name.\n64 “The struggle to survive”: John Darwin, The Empire Project, (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2009) 477\n65 Its architecture: For an excellent overview on the politics of contagion, see Tony\nD. Sampson, Virality, (University of Minnesota Press, 2012)\n50\nTerrorism, we have to understand, is merely one example of network danger and\npower. So is China. And Russia. And these may not even be the most dangerous or\ndevastating network battles that will take place in our lives. It’s a commonplace to\nsay now that the international system is in the greatest period of upheval in more\nthan half a century. But often this sort of remark is accompanied by a list of moving\npieces that seem to be unconnected: China’s rise, the return of Russia, changes in the\nMiddle East, globalization and then reverse globalization. “Who would have thought\nthe post Cold War era, which was supposed to be characterized by ‘softpower’ and\neconomic interdependence would be so violent?” 66 one team of scholars recently\nwrote, reflecting the genuine wonderment of many “experts” who failed to predic\nthe end of the Cold War and then, largely, the nature of what has come after. Who\nwould have thought? Well, as we’ll see, anyone who understands networks.\nThomas Hobbes – the 16 th century British philosopher long considered an early\nmaster of the analysis of cold, brutal power – once put it simply enough: Nations, he\nsaid, need to be mastered. “During the time men live without a common power to\nkeep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war,” he wrote. “Such\na war as is of every man against every man.” 67 A precondition of peace, for Hobbes,\nwas that some country or force or tribe decisively grips a region, an empire, even\nthe globe. “A common power to keep them all in awe,” fulfilled a need for order. In\nour connected age, the common, awesome power is already here. It is networks. The\nbattle now is for and on of this genuinely historic, still curious force. They will be\nattacked, throttled, trashed, accelerated, used, upgraded, won and lost and inflicted\non each of us and our security by those with a new sensibility. To feel the world with\na Seventh Sense will reveal a whole new landscape of power; it will permit us to see\nthe fibers of a new age and then weave them into how we see and think and, finally,\nact. That essential, decisive terrain of our new age is, to the “Smart Power” and\n“Don’t Come Home” crowd, still largely invisible and, anyhow, incomprehensible.\n7.\nJust as rivers or mountains or air currents drove commerce and combat in past eras,\nnetworks will strongly, probably decisively, influence the dynamics ahead. Today\nyou can’t, after all, operate on the rivers or mountains or in the skies or space\nwithout lively, near-instant connection. The space these interlocking networks\noccupy represents a new geography. It is growing every day, as if it were a giant new\ncontinent fusing together under the surface of the sea. We are, as the team at Gee!\nDo! discovered, moving from a world in which nations battled nations to one in\nwhich nations battle networks. And a world where networks battle networks. In\ncoming years, networks will surely break nations, as once nations broke each other.\nIt is linked the systems of trade and economics and biology and data that will create\n66 “Who would have thought”: Robert Hutchings and Jeremi Suri, Foreign Policy\nBreakthroughs: Cases in Successful Diplomacy (Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n2015) p. 2\n67 “During the time”: Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, (Cambridge University Press,\n2002) 88,\n51\nthe conditions for the practice of diplomacy in our future and, when that fails, the\nlandscape for decisive military or economic moves. Mastery of these systems will\nprovide a rich set of creative ways to increase our security, far more effective than\nthe unilateral and inconclusive military force we largely turn to now. A sensibility\nfor networks will unmask developments that look friendly as in fact deeply\ndangerous. It will reveal that some of what may appears a threat is in fact an key to\nsecurity. But this instinct for seeing differenlty has largely not settled upon our\nleaders.\nAlready the emergence of network power is producing strange collisions. Iran\nversus Twitter. The hacking collective Anonymous striking against Mexican drug\nlords, terrorists and Russian television. Tor versus the NSA. The use of financial\nnetworks to crack human trafficking webs. Biological surveillance sensors in cites\nused to fight disease contagion spreads – a network of machines laid against a\nnetwork of bugs. 68 I mean this at nearly every scale. Waves of networked\nautonomous armed drones, for instance, may be among the greatest tactical military\nthreats of the next few decades; the only hope of defense against them will be still\nbetter-enabled, self-thinking and learning defensive meshes, themselves capable of\nresponse at a pace dictated by links of machine learning and communications.\nWriting in 1890, the great American historian and admiral, Alfred Thayer Mahan,\nproduced “The Influence of Sea Power upon History” in which he attempted to\nconvince an age obsessed with land forces of the enduring, decisive power of armed\nocean fleets. Hannibal’s smashing attacks against Rome, Mahan wrote, or Napoleon’s\nfailure against England – in each case “mastery of the sea rested with the victor.” 69\nOur future will bring, almost certainly, a study of the “Influence of Network Power\nupon History”. Here is a a line as true in diplomacy as it is in business or politics:\nMastery of networks – the links of data and trade and security information and\nfinance and others – will rest with the victor.\nFor the most part, the order the American and European world has been\naccustomed to since the Treaties of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years War in the\n17 th century bottled the power to make large-scale change inside states. Nations\nheld a monopoly on the use of force, in a sense. They used it. Violent, state on state\nstruggles were the defining events of global affairs. In such a world, the country with\nthe most power, the greatest material reserves, the strongest sense of national\ndestiny, also enjoyed the most security – and the most options. A few hundred\nthousand British imperial troops overmastered India in this fashion. And a handful\nof really powerful nations struggled over centuries for dominance of the whole\nsystem. Statesmen sought, and even occasionally achieved, temporary balances\nbetween the lurching and violent resets of wars that erupted like a sort of pressure-\n68 Biological surveliance: The foundational text of network battle thinking is John\nArquilla and David Ronfeldt, eds. Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime,\nand Militancy (Santa Monica: RAND, 2001). For a discussion of the biological issues,\nsee Eugene Thacker, “Living Dead Networks”, in Fiberculture Journal No. 4 (2005)\n69 Hanibal’s smashing attacks: Mahan, The Influence of Sea Power upon History\n1660-1783 (Boston: Little, Broan & Co. 1890), iv\n52\nrelease valve for the over-inflated ambitions, nationalism, and hatreds that steamed\nup between nations.\nOn our modern networked systems, however, power is different. On fast connected\nwebs of nearly any sort, tiny forces applied can have immense impacts that leap\nfrom one domain to another. One erroneous commodity trade can snap-scramble a\nmarketplace – and then tip a bucket of chaos into nations, companies and trading\nfirms, One hacker, sneaking into the back-door of a computer network, can – to us a\nterm of art – “brick” a nation’s expensive security systems into devices as lively as a\ndoorstop: STUXNET spinning Iran’s centrifuges into planned madness, for\ninstance. 70 Here’s the essential, dangerous insight about safety in a connected world:\nIt once required a big industrial force to defeat another big industrial force. Such\ngrinding victories required time. They could be prepared for. They could be avoided,\neven. No more. Even the most formidable physical structures of our world –\nmilitaries, markets, governments – can be rendered swiftly immobile by virtual\nattacks on their connected nerve systems. 71 These strikes – or, in some cases, these\naccidents – baffle and then paralyze at network speed, by which I mean less time\nthan it took you to read this sentence. When the American national security strategy\nspeaks of a “long struggle” against terrorism or a rising China, it doesn’t\nacknowledge how fast some of the turns ahead may be. 72 Yes, a decades-long battle\nfor control of essential networks and platforms and protocols lingers ahead. But I\nfear some of the changes ahead will whiplash us with their speed. Generals in World\nWar One lamented that the whole war might have been prevented if diplomatic\ncommunication had been conducted at the stately speed of the horse-carried\nmessage. It was the damn velocity of the telegraph that baffled the judgment of\nstatesmen, they claimed. Figures whose every instinct runs at a pace far slower than\nwhat the age demands were then – and are now – a menace.\nThe great 20 th Century theorist of political realism, Hans Morgenthau, once referred\nto nation states as “blind and potent monsters.” 73 He felt a sort of nervous evil as he\nstudied the moves countries made on the stage of world history. Some of this unease\nwas surely a result of his own life, marked by a lucky escape from Germany in 1937,\nas Hitler was finally perfecting a national machine of lurid and murderous potency. I\nsuspect Morgenthau would have been terrified now by the always-on, all-seeing\nconnected mesh that encloses us. Connected forces move at times like a potent and\ncapricious monster too, smashing businesses or national economies or ecosystems\n70 One hacker: David Raymond, Tom Cross, Gregory Conti, Robert Fanelli, “A\nControl Measure Framework to Limit Collateral Damage and Propagation of Cyber\nWeapons”, Proceedings 5th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO CCD\nCOE Publications, Tallinn 2013).\n71 Even the most formidable: Daniel Geer, “Heartbleed as Metaphor”, Lawfare Blog\nApril 21, 2014\n72 When the American: See 2014 US National Security Strategy\n73 The great 20 th Century theorist: Hans Morgenthau, “The State of Political\nScience,” Politics in the Twentieth Century Vol. 1, (Chicago:University of Chicago\nPress, YEAR HERE)\n53\nwith little useful warning, and anyhow with a merciless and unstoppable efficiency.\nConnected, surprising terrorism has cost trillions to fight; linked-up network\nbusinesses have demolished, surely and even gladly, trillions of dollars of old profit\nsources with their cold, clicking efficiency. Skype blitzes hundreds of billions of\ndollars of long distance telephone profits, for instance. And replaces it with free.\nAmazon, in the space of a few years, cripples marketplace ideas built at the cost of\ntrillions of dollars.\nThe world we’re entering into now, one of constant, sensor-filled data streams that\ngive us a real-time feeling for everything from the temperature of your car before\nyou get in to the pace of your heart as you sleep, means the potent, network forces\nof our day are not “blind” as Morgenthau’s states were, but gifted with an exactness\nof vision. They see everything, always, more than we or our leaders do. They see it\nconstantly. They never forget. Networks seem to have an irresistible and amazing\nenergy that impels them to find and then exploit pin-holes. Think of Al-Qaeda coolly\nregarding the American airline network in 2000, for instance. Or rising powers now\npoking at weaknesses in the international order that we’ve not yet begun to\nconsider, let alone patch up. Whether confronting mobs of network-organized\nterrorists or cascades of computer error, we often discover the unnerving truth that\non these connected systems there is no plug to pull.\nNetworks of one sort or another are hardly new in international affairs, even if the\nsheer scale and speed of our modern systems is totally, revolutionarily fresh. The\nspiderwebbed tendrils of the Ganges River, for instance were a network that fed the\nMughal Empire in the 16 th and 17 th centuries. 74 The Yangtze and the Yellow and the\nMekong river systems each marked out vital webs that carried wealth and\nknowledge into a half-dozen, spectacularly rich Chinese dynasties. Egypt and\nMesopotamia developed great powers that endured for centuries along the Nile and\nthe Euphrates. Later, networks of trade overlaid the Mediterranean, which became\nthe heart of the wealthy Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine empires. And the\ngreatest geographical empire in history, Great Britain, was nothing if not a network\npower, run on sea lines. Waterways, for centuries, pulsed with power. They were\nvital for trade, essential in war and crucial for national freedom.\nNetwork empires emerged on land too, assembled from connected webs of politics,\nof silk and tobacco and gold, or from shared religious passions. These sorts of\nnetworks, sometimes as thin as the trail of a single adventurer like Marco Polo,\ncarried promises of prosperity (and intimations of violence) as they spread. Baron\nAntoin-Henry Jomini, Napoleon’s inspired tactical accomplice, was onto something\nwhen he remarked that it was the interior, networked lines of communication and\nlogistics that had decided and delivered victory for history’s great empires.\n“Methods change,” Jomini observed, “but principles are unchanging.” The skeins of\nlinks running inside national war machines were as essential for security as any\n74 The spiderwebbed tendrils: Peter Turchin, “A theory for the formation of large\nagrarian empires”; Jean-Paul Rodrigue, Claude Comtois, and Brian Slack, The\nGeography of Transport Systems Routledge 2006 p. 10-15\n54\nability to strike out – a lesson Jomini and Napeoleon expensively re-learned at the\nend of their gasping supply lines in Russia in the winter of 1807. 75 In our own day,\njet-meshed networks, commercial webs, satellite links and finance platforms span\nthe omnipresent routes of America’s global reach. So as we consider the information\nnetworks evolving now: the growing connected world that is the largest, fastest,\nmost comprehensive network in history, we should ask ourselves the question\nJomini might have raised: Will an even greater empire be based on control of\ninformation-powered networks?\nThis new world of connectivity won’t immediately devour the old. In fact, the classic\nand the revolutionary will contend for some time, side by side. Cyberweapons and\nnuclear ones in a strange dance, for instance: Imagine that you’re ruling a country\nwith no hope of building your own platforms for medicine, finance, information or\nsecurity. 76 You will be, as a result, uneasily and permanently dependent on the\nnations or groups that do control these elemental, algorithmic and efficient tools. If\nyou’re running a medium-sized country there’s no chance your own IT industry can\ndevelop a search engine with the reach and fluency of Google; or a cybersecurity\nsystem with the omnipresence of some Chinese database. Might this make you more\neager for nuclear weapons? For an atomic hedge against the day you find yourself\nthreatened with national unplugging? Networks, we’ll discover, don’t lift us above\nthe old conflicts so much as they complicate them. They fill the old hatreds with new\nfidelity; sharpen the old grudges and make it easier than ever to slap at the world\nwhen you’re angry. While it is tempting to say that we’ve moved from a world of\n“cold weapons” like planes and tanks to a world of “hot weapons” where digital light\npulses and biological infections will prevail, really it is the strange blending of these\ncold and hot systems that is so interesting, so dangerous. Ever more precise\nexploding iron bombs, made from a fusion of GPS data and TNT, will be a part of our\nfuture, as will pathogens tuned by computer and delivered according to network\nintelligence about where a contagion might best be started.\nOrwell’s well-worn line – “The history of civilization is largely the history of\nweapons” – settles uneasily onto a networked world. 77 The networks are, so clearly\nalready, becoming weaponized. And a great strategist should know and use the\nmaterials of his day. Napoleon had a gunpowder-burn familiarity with his artillery;\nMao possessed a wizened guerilla sensibility. The electric, shifting and shocking\nmaterials of our global networks are going to be used in pursuit of power anyhow,\nso we had best consider how to become fluent with their real nature, how turn them\nto our advantage – and ideally find a way to use them to so profoundly change the\nrules of conflict that hurried, unconsidered and useless reaction will be all our\nenemies can manage. Over the centuries shifts in power and wealth were achieved\n75 The skeins: John Arquilla and Ryan Nomura “Three Wars of Ideas about the Idea\nof War,” Comparative Strategy, 34:2 (2015), 186\n76 Cyberweapons: Mary Kaldor, “In Defence of New Wars,” Stability, 2(1) 2013: 4,\npp. 1-16,\n77 Orwell’s well-worn line: George Orwell, “You and the Atom Bomb” in George\nOrwell: In Front of Your Nose, 1946-1950. (Nonpareil Books 2000) 7\n55\nby armies, by naval and air attacks. Now it is the ownership and use of connection,\nof networks and machine intelligence that will deliver real, perhaps even final,\nleverage.\nIf the strategic aim of Europe’s leaders after Napoleon’s violent emergence and\ndefeat was to restore a balance of power, if America’s grand strategic purpose after\nWorld War Two was the containment of the USSR and her totalizing ideologies,\nnations now must try for positions of security and for command during the uneasy\ntransition ahead. The wellbeing of the whole system becomes a concern; entities,\nprotocols and ideas that threaten the system’s health are the most urgent dangers,\neven as they represent seats of potentially historic power. We should ask: How is it\nthat international cooperation occurs in an age of connection? Will it happen\nthrough slow, incremental movement? In sudden bursts? In fact, the routes to\ncooperation are rarely easy in any age. They involve overcoming old bureaucratic\nideas, deeply held instincts of national interest, broken and humid and sometimes\nmurderous psychological needs – all while accepting a new picture of power – and\nfresh risks and responsibilities. Our problem now, even in the face of these snapping\ntraps, is to define a clear vision of our future security – and then to make a path to\nget there. No route exists today. “Originally, there were no roads in the world,” the\nChinese writer Lu Xun observed in a famous story at the start of the last century. “It\nis only by walking on them that paths are made.” 78 Ours is an age of first steps.\nThe social scientists John Padgett and Walter Powell, after considering examples of\nepochal, collapsing change in political and biological systems of all sorts –\nRenaissance finance markets, coral reefs, innovation clusters, and others – summed\nup their conclusions in a little koan-like package of logic: “In the short run, actors\ncreate relations. In the long run, relations create actors.” 79 The nouns we worry\nabout now, and the ones we hope for, take their meaning and their risk and energy\nfrom relations. Your genome connected is different and more hopeful than it is\nalone, unplugged, slipping into cancer. This idea that relations create actors is a\npowerful basis for a new, enduring – even decent – grand strategy for an age of\nrevolutionary connection. It should also offer a check against some of our horrible\nmiscalculations: America invaded Iraq, for instance, intending to replace one state\nwith another. Instead we replaced a state with a network – and not one that we\ncontrolled. That web still resists our old habits of control. Relations of family and\nfaith and clan link and activate murderous, relentless actors. The super power had\nall the nouns: Tanks, planes, soldiers, money. But we did not have the networks. We\ncould not create relations. No move of ours held for long. We were like the team\nJIEEDO – trying to defeat the wrong thing entirely.\n78 “Originally, there were no roads”: Lu Xun, “My Old Home” in Diary of a Madman\nand Other Stories Trans. William A. Lyell (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press,\n1990.) 89–100, though the translation of the line here is my own.\n79 “In the short run”: John F. Padgett and Walter W. Powell, ”The Problem of\nEmergence” in The Emergence of Organizations and Markets, Princeton University\nPress, 2012\n56\nAs a start let’s at least fix the weird language of our current foreign policy world: We\ndon’t live in what they like to call a “Post Cold War” era anymore. (Who, after all,\ncalled the Enlightenment the “post-Feudal era”?) We live in what is probably best\ncalled “The Age of Network Power.” A world of connection is responding to a\npowerful logic of its own. It builds new platforms, sometimes defined by users or by\ntechnology or by the way in which currency or weapons move. Melvin Conway’s\ndeep engineering insight was right, the design of networks does affect our real\nworld. Even now it is shuffling us into “convergence” and “divergence” clubs. What\nis next is the struggle to decide who is in which club. What businesses will win?\nWhat technologies? Which ideas? Our only chance will be to learn a new instinct for\njust how power moves on networks. And it’s to this that we will turn now.\n57\nPart Two: The Seventh Sense\n58\nChapter Four: The Jaws of Connection\nIn which the Seventh Sense explains the strange, new way power behaves on networks .\n1.\nThe Envoy, Frank Wisner Jr., had gotten the phone call on a Thursday, late in the\nafternoon, and within a few hours he was on a plane. It was an unusual request from\nthe White House and from the State Department – and though he was a man who\nhad lived a life of many unusual requests, he knew that this one had a certain\nsignificance, a weight you might say, if you were the sort of man who measured such\nthings in human lives.\nThe Envoy was such a man. His father, Frank Wisner Sr., had been one too. Senior\nwas one of the most famous and effective of America’s Cold War spies. He’d run the\nOffice of Special Services in Southern Europe during World War Two and then built\noperations for the Central Intelligence Agency in the years after. He was a tough\nman, from a generation of Americans that had fought and won wars and who,\nunquestioningly, weighed their actions in human lives. As a spy in Romania in 1940,\nWisner Sr. had watched the Red Army, like some sort of sick machine, round up and\nthen execute scores of his friends. The course of his life was set. “Wisner landed like\na dynamo,” William Colby – a future CIA director who worked for Senior – observed.\n“He started operating in the atmosphere of an order of the Knights of Templar, to\nsave Western freedom from Communist darkness—and war.” 80\nFrank Wisner Jr., was known too as a dynamo. He was 72 in the winter of 2011\nwhen the White House called. He’d had already a storied career as a diplomat,\nfollowing a rough trace of his father’s man-on-a-mission trajectory, also with a bit of\nthat secretive Knights of Templar feeling: Princeton, Vietnam, the Philippines, the\nhalls of the State Department in Foggy Bottom. Wisner had become the first phone\ncall for some of America’s leading corporate figures when they found themselves\nbillions of dollars backwards in some strange land, even as he’d remained closely in\ntouch with the most explosive policy puzzles. Iran. North Korea. He was a voluble\nand opinionated man, but somehow also discreet, exact and patient. The\ncombination made him at once totally reliable and a great deal of fun. He had been,\nover the years, a warm and personable figure in my own life, the sort of man who\ntook the long view of any problem, who lay his hand comfortably on your knee with\nreassurance when some promise came undone and threatened a bit of chaos. He\nwas like an ideogram of reliability: Bukly, bald, coiled, loyal. He’d seen it all, you felt.\nFrank Wisner Jr. had served as Ambassador to Egypt for half-a-decade in the 1980s.\nAlmost inevitably, his careful manner and easy charm led him into a close\nrelationship with Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president. Mubarak was an urbane\nformer fighter pilot who had come to sudden and surprising power after the\n80 “Wisner landed”: William Colby, Honorable Men: My Life in the CIA (New York\n1978), 73\n59\nassassination of Anwar Sadat on a calm afternoon in October 1981. Wisner arrived a\nfew years later. Though not quite a friend, Wisner had cultivated a directness at\nleast, with Mubarak. He’d become a mirror in which the Egyptian president might\nsee how different stances towards America or Israel would appear to the rest of the\nworld. So when, in the winter of 2011, the White House saw Mubarak facing waves\nof unimagined protest, at a moment when it looked like the Egyptian president\nwould become the latest head of state to topple amidst the accelerating discontent\nthat would be known as the Arab Spring, they sent Wisner with a message for\nMubarak: No killing – and it is time for you to retire.\nWisner later recalled the tension of Cairo when he arrived. The city felt nervous in a\nway he’d not seen before. He landed in the early morning and went almost\nimmediately to see the President. The situation would be brought back to normal,\nMubarak assured Wisner. Soon. He’d fired most of his cabinet a few days earlier. He\nhad promised reform, and had begun studying what might be done first, and how\nsoon it might be carefully attempted. He hinted to Wisner that the rumored\ntransition of power to his son Gamal was not, after all, inevitable. But, Mubarak said,\nhe wasn’t going anywhere just now.\nWisner tried another tack: He asked if the President would like to leave the country.\nMaybe a trip for medical treatment? Mubarak dismissed the idea. He’d seen worse,\nhe reminded Wisner. Mubarak had been sitting inches away from Sadat on that\nfateful October day in 1981. He himself had survived six assassination attempts. In\nfact, he said he intended to go on television again that very evening. He would speak\ndirectly to the protestors. He would tell them and the Egyptian people of his plans\nfor reform and for a gradual transition of power. He would remind them of the\ngreatness of their national spirit. He would evoke the immensity of their ancient\nhistory. And he would be sure they understood that he would stay, he would die on\nEgyptian soil. You can tell that to the White House too, Mubarak told Wisner. He\nvouchsafed, at the end of their talk, at least some of the assurances the envoy had\ncome to collect: No violence. A graceful departure at some point. Elections, even. But\nall on his timetable.\nAround Mubarak in those days, Wisner recalled, he saw bafflement. Resolution\nadmixed with surprise. These men in that Egyptian power structure, all wealthy and\ncomfortable and perfectly secure, had thought their places impregnable. They were,\nafter all, the thin human line between the modern world and the boiling mad Islamic\nfundamentalists who hungered to rule the country. They’d arrested the usual\ndissidents, closed down the normal channels, checked with their informants.\nNothing. The old, reliable vents for unrest hadn’t worked. The pressures grew. It\nwas perhaps easy to understand why they thought they’d survive. They’d never\nfailed. Mubarak had been president for 30 years. For now, at least, the syllogistic\nlogic fluttering through the President’s own arguments reassured them: Egypt\nwants stability. Only I can deliver stability. Therefore, Egypt wants me.\nWisner left the Presidential Palace. He reported what he’d learned back to\nWashington and, work done, headed to the airport. That evening he found himself\n60\nwaiting for his flight in front of a TV in the crapped-out lobby of an old hotel on the\nroad out of town, watching Mubarak’s promised speech. The President projected\ntotal confidence on screen. This was the Mubarak Wisner had known in the 1980s.\nThere had always been a barreling self-assurance about the man; it was alive in him\nnow, facing the unthinkable. Ruggedly handsome and perfectly controlled. You could\nalmost believe, as Wisner did for a moment, “This was a great man who had led a\ncountry through difficult times. He will endure.” Six assassination attempts. Mubarak\nhad always been a survivor.\nYet as he watched, Wisner knew the challenge the great man faced. Did Mubarak, he\nwondered? Did he even understand what was happening around him? That he was\ngiving the speech on television, in the face of this strange revolutionary movement\nthat was unfolding on the smart phones of Cairo as much as on its streets, was a\nsubtle admission: Old power struggles to handle new rules. Wisner had seen tapes\nof the earlier speeches, the ones intended to calm the crowds which had in fact\ninflamed them further. He knew just how fine the edge Mubarak now paced.\nMubarak needed to address the protestors on their own level. He needed to show he\nunderstood. There was only one thing he must not do, Wisner thought as he\nwatched. He must not address the protesters paternalistically, as a father might\nspeak to a child. On the screen in front of him, Mubarak continued in his steady,\nslightly strident voice. “I am speaking to you all from the heart,” he said. “A speech\nfrom a father to his sons and daughters.”\nTwo weeks later, Mubarak was gone.\nImagine, for a moment, you are Mubarak – or really any successful early 21 st century\nautocrat. You’ve managed several decades of control in your Middle Eastern, North\nAfrican or Asian country. Perhaps you’ve inherited your position from your father or\nan uncle. They’ve taught you about power. Keep it tightly controlled. Replace key\nofficials regularly. Execute your enemies from time to time. You’ve learned the\nvirtues of the hard crackdown. You’ve sent your security officers to the best military\nschools in the US and Europe, and taught them to temper their firm grip with (a bit\nof) humanity. In short, you’ve mastered the use of a strong hand and the\nestablishment of a certain national logic that suggested your name – Qadafi or\nMubarak or el-Abidine ben Ali – as a synonym for stability, for prosperity and even\npride. This seems to you like the most stable possible order. You know that someday\nit might have to change, but that day seems a long way off. You delay reform. You\nprepare your son to take over. Meanwhile, your citizens begin to acquire the\nInternet and cell phones. And one day in 2008, following a financial crisis far away\nfrom your own shores, you begin to notice an unnerving trend.\nOn the streets of Iceland and then Spain and then Chile and then Israel and Ukraine\nand Turkey and Mexico and then New York City, thousands or hundreds of\nthousands of citizens gather. There is no one leader of any of these protests. Instead\nthese movements breathe and grow like an organic whole. The discontent is diffuse\n2.\n61\neven if the result is similar: Mass gatherings, control of some essential public space –\na square, a stock exchange, a park. All organized, it appears, using completely\nethereal techniques: Text messages, video postings, chat rooms. Similar movements\nappear around in the world. In Iran, in Italy, in Russia. “Occupy Wall Street”,\nblossoms in New York City, a protest against wealth inequality and finance. It\nbecomes a self-franchising social movement, appearing in hundreds of cities:\nOccupy Hollywood. Occupy Central in Hong Kong. Occupy – strangely – Vegas.\nThen in Sidi Bouzid, a Tunisian town you’ve never heard of, far away from all these\nunstable looking mobs, a spark lands. A local man has set himself on fire. Police\n(worse, a police woman) had confiscated his scales and his fruit and then tossed him\naround for no reason other than that he was poor and could do nothing about it. It is\nNovember 2010. Within hours protests begin in Sidi Bouzid. They spread to Tunis.\n81 Then Tripoli. Then Damascus. You watch as the anger, moving on once-invisible\ntechnological lines of video and text, demolishes the stability of all of North Africa.\nOver the next two years leaders are pushed from power in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and\nYemen: their names, instead of being symbols of stability, instantly cast as sources\nof injustice. Other countries – Syria, Algeria, Sudan, and Bahrain tumble for periods\ninto the black hole of civil violence. Some people mistake all this for a democratic\nrevolution. Over time, however, it’s clear this is hardly that. Something more\ncomplex is emerging from the violent mist. New, nearly virtual terror groups\norganized themselves in the vacuum, hyper-lethal versions of connected protest. A\nnew kind of political energy, a method of linking people and ideas and an easy\ndestructive power, is alive. It seems to be as active in cynical, murderous\nfundamentalists as in the optimistic peace-hoping youth. Democratic revolution? No.\nRevolution? Yes, clearly, that.\nA few years later, after you’ve been replaced or are on the run, after your own\ncountry has had upheaval and you’ve had your visit from a well-meaning American\ndiplomat urging you towards a quiet retirement house in Saudi Arabi, the Spanish\nsocial philosopher Manuel Castells will name the disease that undid you. Castells is\nperhaps an unlikely figure to diagnose the political illness that infected so much of\nthe world after 2008. An elfin, kinetic figure with a disorganized mop of grey hair, he\nsports the wardrobe of an accountant and a rolling Spanish accent that flavors his\nspeech with a surprising taste of romance. It’s a mixture that seems somehow ideal\nfor a world often on his lips: “Reevolootion.” With the meticulous care an\nanthropologist might bring to documenting a distant, undiscovered tribe, Castells\nhas spent decades finger-poking, classifying and explaining networks. In the late\n1990s his books, lectures and research set the frame for the world we inhabit: fastchanging,\nripped through by communications and technology, linked in unusual\nways. “The network society,” he explained, “represents a qualitative change in the\nhuman experience,” he explained. 82\n81 They spread to Tunis: Mohamed Zayani, Networked Publics and Digital\nContention: The Politcs of Everyday Life in Tunisia, Oxford University Press (2015)\n82 “The network society”: Manuel Castells, The Rise of the Network Society (Malden,\nMass: Blackwell Publishers, 1996), 508\n62\nInevitably, Castells became curious about how such a change was affecting politics.\nSpeaking to an audience at Harvard in the spring of 2014, he reviewed what he had\nlearned in the past decade – and particularly in the years since 2008, much of which\nhe had spent dropping into the ground-zero sites where network protest and\ndissatisfaction were exploding. “We are witnessing,” he told the audience, “the birth\nof a new form of social movement.” 83 Information technology was breeding massive,\nrapidly moving social waves. These movements went from invisible to irresistible in\ninstants. They pressed for political change or for economic justice or even for – and\nthis was odd for such wired up efforts, but anyhow – a return to a pre-technological\nage. In most of these countries, the older organizations had little appeal to a new\ngeneration of protesters. The political parties smelled of rot. The media was stateowned\nor controlled by billionaires. For a generation used to instant empowerment,\nthe time to work inside these broken structures seemed impossibly long. And,\nanyhow, another option existed. Twitter or Facebook or YouTube had taught them.\nSo riots in those dozens of cities, unplanned and uncontrolled, emerged. 84 The\n“Collective Action,” of popular movements for hundreds of years from Bastilleraiders\nto labor actions, was replaced – upgraded? – into “Connective Action.”\nPeople who’d never met and who shared very different histories and desires, were\nconnected, fused together by lightspeed bits in hope or fury or vengeful rage. 85 This\nwas, perhaps, predictable. It mirrored the linked, fast-spreading dynamism of the\n2008 crisis itself. As the British central banker and economist Andy Haldane\nobserved, the world had never before suffered a genuinely global financial crisis,\nwith every county on the planet, tied together as they were by finance and\ntechnology (and fear), tumbling off a cliff at the same, nano-second instant. 86 In one\nthree month period, the entire global economy shrunk by five percent.\nAs fast as shocks like that economic one spread, these linked network social\nreactions seemed to move faster still, echoing each other, with ever louder and more\ncomplex results. The technology itself became as important to the emergence of new\ngroups as their ideas. The terror phenomenon of ISIS, for instance, emerged almost\nentirely along skeins of digital connection, and was itself a reaction to the networkled\ndisruption of the Arab Spring – and the earlier fracturing of older order in Iraq.\nWhen President Obama dismissively called ISIS the junior-varsity squad of terror\nand said there was nothing much for the West to worry about, he was reflecting the\n83 “We are witnessing”: Manuel Castells \"The Space of Autonomy: Cyberspace and\nUrban Space in Networked Social Movements\", Speech at Harvard GSD, February\n2014, available online\n84 And, anyhow: Raquel Alvarez, David Garcia, Yamir Moreno, and Frank\nSchweitzer. \"Sentiment Cascades in the 15M Movement.\" EPJ Data Sci.

These kids can’t\npossibly amount to much. The youth of these groups, the very fact that they were not\nthe varsity team, their intimate fingertip familiarity with virtual spaces – all this\ngave this new generation of movements energy, appeal, attraction. Even in countries\nthat looked technologically “backwards” by American standards, linked systems\nspeed-bred revolution, they gleefully filled in for a failed traditional media, and they\naccelerated and enabled the creation of groups as different as the Syrian Electronic\nArmy and Occupy Hong Kong. 87\nTraditionally, such a long list of hopeless exclusions (no money, no friends, no\naccess, no power) added up to an easy judgment of irrelevance. But ISIS was like the\nthe Iranian bloggers and American social justice campaigners and Swedish digital\npirates and vengeful Houthi fighters who were all staring back, confidently, at the\npeople who had the money, the friends and the power – and the drones. Obama and\nMubarak and – fill in the blank with a powerful name or institution – were too slow.\nOut of touch. Their connections were all wrong. So while the individual parts of the\nnew networks – young students, poorly trained armed fighters – were soft and\nhuman and easy to destroy, they still tore unstoppably at old power. Tied together,\nthe connected systems themselves were capable of more than their individual\nstrength might suggest. What they shared wasn’t simply a single issue or identity. It\nwas cheap, constant connection. And they were, frankly, furious.\nThe old guys were crafty, of course. They tried to shut down the technology itself. Or\nthey aimed at crucial points on the network. “Arrest or kill the leaders you can find!”\nwas the sort of order that bolted stability back onto Iran, for example. Other\ngovernments found they could crack the will of the protesters by going after their\nrelatives. “Relational repression,” as it became known, was the closest a big power\ncould get, quickly, to using one network to fight another. And there were other\nstrategies: The Egyptian military, for instance, played a deadly serious long game.\nThey gave in on a few points. They let the massed opposition and Islamic networks\ncome to power. But this was merely a pretext, a way to map the ties of these groups,\nto coldly study how they functioned and record the secret sources of their power\nand influence and money. Then, when the Egyptian population tired of these failing,\namateurish new leaders – as the military knew they someday would – the generals\nmoved.\nSkeptics would demand of Castells: What the hell did any of these protests really\naccomplish? What sort of reevolootion was it that left nothing but chaotic sink holes\nin Tripoli and Damascus? What they accomplished, Castells conceded, was mostly\ndestructive. But that was the point. This smashing at old laws, the cracking apart of\nideas of power and control had changed the landscape. And it had revealed a hidden\nlogic of connection. Irrelevant? That was like saying earthquakes or epidemics\nshould be overlooked. In their vibrating apart of once-solid structures, networked\nsocial movements told a great deal. They revelaled interconnected fault lines. They\n87 Even in countries: Edwin Grohe “The Cyber Dimensions of the Syrian Civil War:\nImplications for Future Conflict,” Comparative Strategy, (2015) 34:2, 133-148\n64\nshowed how groups could suck power into themselves from networks, along\ninvisible lines, and animate themselves as if by connection to electricity. The\nprotesters and terrorists understood power that existed simply because of\nconnectivity. They understood how easy it was to connect. And so they had an\ninstinct that eluded the comfortable men in the palaces. The usual reaction of\nauthorities – Round up the usual suspects – didn’t work because, as Castells noted,\n“The usual suspects were networks.” You couldn’t arrest a network.\n3.\nBefore we can go much further in figuring out how network power might be used –\nto close up those six worrisome paradoxes, to create massive new companies (or\ninvest in them), to rebuild our politics – I think we need a picture of sorts in our\nheads of this new landscape. What does a network look like? How does it’s design\naffect its operation? Yes, it’s true you can’t arrest a network. But can you say\nsomething about how it’s different? Can you spot the parts that are dangerous?\nWhen someone like Castells says to us, “Power is moving,” what does that mean\nexactly? Where is it going? What I want to do now is begin to assemble an image of a\nnetwork, and to show what that sort of linked design tells us about where we are\nnow and where we’re going. Then, with such a picture, firmly in our minds, we can\nask just what these networks are for, after all, and how they might be used.\nIt is an old chestnut of historians and anthropologists that power – the ability to\nmake or cause things to happen – is often determined by structure. When I say,\n“Superpower” I am painting a picture of the international system with a single word.\n“Highway,” does the same – and tells you something about logistics, trucks,\neconomic power. Or “City.” This is why “org charts” have such a decisive power.\nThink of the map of power in your family or your office or a nation. Who makes the\ndecisions? Why? The way we bottle up our lives in firms or congresses or\nuniversities flavors just about every other decision we make 88 . An imperial CEO,\nprone to visions and control creates a different sort of firm than a boss who moves\namong his employees nearly as an equal. An army that moves from the top down is\ndifferent than one that lives, as Mao said of the Chinese guerilla forces that mastered\nthe country against steep odds in 1949, “as if they were fish and the people were\nwater.” Power is always packed into structures of some sort. Emperors, kings,\npresidents and congresses all reflect certain arrangements. But those arrangements\nchange; power moves. You can see leaders struggle with this constant shifting:\nThink of the “Englightened Despotism” of the 18 th Century as Frederick II of Prussia,\nJoseph II of the Hapsburgs and Catherine II in St. Petersburg each struggled to marry\nthe then-new ideas of liberty with older instincts of control. History is, in one sense,\nnothing but the tale of the movement of power. Once the idea of an Assyrian king\nemperor was new, as was the notion of a President or a Pope. History is paced by\nthe arrival of new species of all sorts; and by the death of others. This is as true for\ninstitutions as is it for bugs. With this caveat: No one gives up power easily.\n88 The way we: See Venkatesh Rao, “The Amazing, Shrinking Org Chart”, on\nRibbonfarm.com, May 28, 2015\n65\nHere’s what’s unnerving about this for us now: There are whole approaches to\npower that look extremely reasonable until one day they look insane. For thousands\nof years the idea that one feudal lord should control thousands of serfs seemed\nperfectly reasonable to the lords and serfs alike. John Maynard Keynes’ famous line\nabout Egypt – Just because you built the pyramids doesn’t mean you get to use them –\nmarked a whole approach that seemed inarguable for centuries, even if the\nexperience of it was inarguably awful 89 . Features of the world – moats, massive\ncathedrals, pyramids, sweatshops – exist only because distributions of power\npermitted or enabled or encouraged them. The quotidian interactions of our lives –\nhow we shop, where we hang out with friends, the kinds of performance or politics\nwe follow – these all produce long-lasting structures. Malls, democracies, war\nzones. 90 Pushing power into networks, we can see already, creates whole new\narrangements. Some are as unimaginable to us now as a voting booth would have\nbeen to an Egyptian slave. When we say that ours is a revolutionary age, it’s not\nbecause you can watch videos on your phone. It’s because of why you can watch\nvideo on your phone – and what that implies for the old, nervous structures around\nus.\n4.\nBefore the age of the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution began most political\nand economic power was extremely concentrated. A few kings and feudal lords\ncontrolled most economic production. Priests decided who could speak to God, and\nhow and when. Finance was dominated by a few families, largely working in the\nsecretive counting rooms of early banking capitals such as Amsterdam or Genoa or\nLyon. Knowledge about the world, a sense of science and of history and even\ngeography, was closely held, fiercely opaque. Inside monastery walls or university\nhalls the aim of protecting (and editing) what the world knew far outstripped any\nhunger for new ideas, for innovation or dissemination. In those times a lucky or\nbrutal few decided the economic, political and intellectual lives of many. You can\npicture power as balled up almost, in the hands of a tiny and fortunate elite.\nOver time, cracks appeared in this system. One of the earliest was also one of the\nmost fundamental: The schism that split the Catholic Church. This was, at first, the\nwork of a young German theologian named Martin Luther in the 16 th Century.\nLuther was a man whose view of life, he would say often in later years, was shaped\nby a single sentence: Romans 1:17. “The righteousness of God is revealed from faith\nto faith, as it is written: The just shall live by faith.” The Epistle to the Romans, as\nRomans is formally titled, was a letter from Saint Paul to a collection of recalcitrant,\n89 John Maynard Keynes’ famous line: Keynes, The Economic Consequences of the\nPeace, p. 16\n90 David Murakami Wood and Stephen Graham “Permeable Boundaries in the\nSoftware-Sorted Society: Survelliance and the Differentiations of Mobillity” in Mobile\nTechnologies of the City eds. Mimi Sheller and John Urry. (London: Routledge. 2006)\nChapter 10\n66\nspiritually mordant Jews in Rome. His message was among the simplest and most\ncompact and personal possible: The transmission of faith requires nothing more and\nnothing less than faith itself. Romans teaches us that believing in God, which is faith,\nis enough for access to all the riches of heaven: God’s righteousness, an afterlife,\nforgiveness.\nBy Luther’s age, however, access to those riches was not so simple. Among other\nthings, spiritual control had become a source of lucre for the church. The glory of the\nCatholic Church, her magnificent cathedrals and clothes, and her insidious habits of\nselling passes to heaven in the form of indulgences – this was a deployment of faith\nand power marked by a venality that grated against Luther’s from-faith-to-faith\nsensibility. When he saw his own congregation increasingly slipping away to\nchurches with priests who would do what he would not, which was to market and\nsell indulgences, he saw a rank, strange hypocrisy: The Church as an economic\ninstrument. His rage boiled over in the summer of 1517, and he summarized his\ncase against the Church in the 95 Theses that he nailed to the door of his local\nchurch on October 31 st . Papa non vult nec potest ullas penas remittere preter eas,\nquas arbitrio vel suo vel canonum imposuit, he wrote in Thesis Five: No matter what\nyou might pay him, the Pope can’t influence what happens to you after you die. Or,\nThesis 78, Euangelici rhetia sunt, quibus olim piscabantur viros divitiarum.\nIndulgences are nets with which one fishes for the riches of men.\nAs much as Luther was crying for a restoration of Saint Paul’s sense of a personal\nfaith, he was also starting a difficult and – for the Church – unpleasant argument\nabout power. Our relation to God, Luther meant, is our relation. It’s not something to\nbe brokered or sold or negotiated. It does not require fancy clothes or cathedrals or\nhierarchies. For Luther, this new logic had engendered a profound spiritual crisis.\nHe recalled, later in life, the very first time he’d encountered the possibility of direct\naccess to God, in the pages of Saint Augustine, probably around 1508. “When I came\nto the words ‘thee, most merciful father,’” he wrote, “the thought that I had to speak\nto God without a mediator almost made me flee.” 91 Who was he, Martin Luther, to\nspeak directly to God? But from then on, Luther’s experience of God, his own sense\nof power honestly passing from faith to faith – and not from faith to church to faith –\nembodied an extremely heretical idea about power: faith without a middleman.\nSuch a concept undid much of what had been taken as inarguable doctrine. The\nChurch immediately understood the danger. They rushed to label Luther as heretical\nand, later, crazy. In arguing that the Catholic Church, with all of its magnificent\ntrappings of faith, was really a useless toll gate, Luther was picking at a still larger,\nmore significant question: How should power be split? If Luther was right, and God\nshould be accessible directly to each of us, then some other questions tumbled after\nthat one. Should we have direct access to political power? To ideas? To money and\nland and control of our own economic destiny? Could “from faith to faith,” be recast\nas “from idea to idea” or “truth to truth” or – and this turned out to be the really\n91 “When I came to the words”: Preserved Smith, The Life and Letters of Martin\nLuther, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1911) Introduction\n67\nviolent shift – “from citizen to citizen as equals”? The Church was merely one of\nmany institutions that had sat massively, reliably, comfortably (and greedily)\nbetween people and power.\nLuther, it later emerged, was not alone. An era of awkward answers had begun. The\nPrussian astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, for instance, had preceded Luther by a\ncouple of decades with his own questioning of the unquestionable. “Those who\nknow that the consensus of many centuries has sanctioned the idea that the earth\nremains at rest while the heavens move around it would regard it as an insane\npronouncement if I said the opposite,” he wrote. Machiavelli, Galileo, Erasmus, a\ngrowing list of great, transformative names – they were all working away in this\nsame questioning spirit. Their insane pronouncements, when proven true, opened\nthe way to still further insights. The Enlightenment had begun. The old power\ncenters acted almost as if nothing had changed; maybe they believed nothing would\never need to. “What was, still is,” the Catholic Church pronounced confidently (and\nabsurdly) at the Council of Trent in response to Luther’s Reformation. But there was\nno turning back. As the German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote, the motto of the\nera could best be summarized as: Dare to know! “The Enlightenment,” he explained,\n“requires nothing but freedom.” 92\nThis, it emerged, was a hell of an expensive requirement.\n4.\nIn the years after Luther’s 95 Theses, Europe was torn apart. The continent’s\nlongstanding image of power – balled up, concentrated, unquestioned – was ripped\naway. Another picture emerged. The idea of personal access to God, a kind of “one\nman, one prayer” approach to religion, which opened in turn other fundamental\nstruggles. The credibility of nearly every sacred body that had once depended on\ncontrolling people and limiting their choices – the Church, those kings, feudalism,\nmyths – faced a creeping erosion. “Human knowledge and human power come to the\nsame thing,” the English philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon observed in the\nmidst of this shift in his artillery shell of a book The New Organum. Human\nknowledge, he means, is human power. You can imagine the energy, the promise of\nthe book as it was passed in Latin copy to Kepler in his study in Linz (then Lintz), to\nGallileo in Venice a decade before his imprisonment. It was this same human power\nto question even the most sacred ideas that the masses of Enlightenment Europe\nwould use, gleefully at times, to claw apart most of the old structures. 93 Luther’s\nheresy led initially to the Wars of the Reformation, battles that pulled every\nEuropean royal family into a struggle between church and state, and then between\neach other. The bloodletting of The Thirty Years War, the first truly pan-European\n92 “The Enlightenment”: Immanuel Kant, “An Answer to the Question: What is\nEnlightenment?” Kant: Political Writings, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n1991) p. 54\n93 “Human knowledge”: Francis Bacon, The New Organon. Cambridge Texts in the\nHistory of Philosophy. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000) 32\n68\nconflict, established in its aftermath a new balance that let each King select the\nreligion of his subjects. Cuius regio, eius religio as the agreements of Westphalia\ndecided in 1648 – or Whose realm, whose religion. This produced some stability, but\nnot for long. You could read that line, after all, very personally and see what it\ndemanded next: My realm, my religion.\nIn a sense, this revolutionary tumult was necessary to pull power from a\ncomfortable, established asymmetric arrangement, in which a few people controlled\nso much, and into something more symmetric. Luther’s Reformation thinking made\nGod directly, instantly accessible to anyone. (Just as Copernicus’ scientific way of\nthinking gave us, eventually, the ability to question if God existed at all.) Individuals\n– and the very birth of the idea of individualism was another heretical slap at the old\ninstitutions – could balance and contend and argue as equals. The notion that men\nwere “created equal” became increasingly evident in this generation, even as\nestablishing that equality triggered the French Revolution, the American Civil War\nand countless similar conflicts. Democratic systems aspired to enshrine this new\nbalance, shifting countries from rule-by-birth to rule-by-majorities. In economics,\nmarkets reflected the new picture of power too. How good is that product? What is\nthe price? Is there demand? became the essential questions, not Which Lord controls\nthat field. Releasing power into the busy arms of businessmen, politicians, scientists\nand artists meant ideas, politics and innovations contended one against the other.\nThey got better. They evolved. And the sum of all these interacting pieces made\nsustained economic growth into a reality for the first time in history. In a\n“commercial society,” Adam Smith explained in The Wealth of Nations, “Every man\nlives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant.” 94 Smith didn’t mean\neveryone was really a merchant, rather that in a world of markets each of us – our\nlabor, our ideas, our capital – is a commodity. We are liberated, but only to compete.\nFor votes, for jobs, for resources.\nIf the old faiths and institutions couldn’t stand the pressures of these powerful,\nequalizing forces, then new ones had to be built. “The scaffolds humans erect,” the\nNobel prize-winning economist Douglass North called these foundations. 95 The idea\nof equality of influence or power – not merely opportunity – demanded new\ncontainers: voting booths, congresses, unions. Rule of law was one of the most\nurgently essential: a single code that could be laid down evenly across a society,\ndemanding that principles of order outweighed the habitual advantages of\nprominence or power or birth. Law aspired to make men equal in front of courts.\nThis, in turn, suggested a new degree of fairness up and down the social order.\nBroader literacy, the standardization of measurements or the birth of universal\ncredit and currencies were all tools for spreading access. Museums, scientific\ncongresses and industrial fairs helped turn sparks of theoretical knowledge into the\n94 In a commercial society: Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2008) 32\n95 “The scaffolds humans erect”: Douglass C. North, Understanding the Process of\nEconomic Change, (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2010) 48\n69\npractical heat of industry. 96 Ever-more efficient use of iron, of steam, of electricity all\nreflected a virtuous loop of theory and practice, between the lab and the market, the\nscientist and the businessman.\nThis fusion of the instinct for competition, for constant new innovation, delivered\nthe modern world you and I live in today. “All fixed, fast-frozen relations,” Karl Marx\nand Friedrich Engels wrote in 1849 about the speed of this change, “are swept away.\nAll new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid,\nmelts into air.” 97 As more people “dared to know”, the big ideas and big thinkers\nattracted an audience. Arguments started. New ways to record and share the\nanswers appeared too. Locke or Newton or Darwin were as notable for the crowd of\ndebating, curious citizens they attracted as for their ideas. Such contentious\ndiscussions were designed to elicit truth, to give individuals that same shocking\nsense Luther had felt on discovering a powerful idea by himself; but as important\nwas that these debates were recorded – written and then distributed in journals,\nbooks and letters. For most of history, after all, knowledge suffered from its own\nfragility and asymmetry: There was always a chance, maybe even a likelihood, that\nsome important insight would be lost in a plague, strangled as heretical, burnt up in\na library fire, or dissolved by some military misfortune. This is why, for instance, we\nhave almost all of Shakespeare and why we are missing so much of Sappho.\nWidespread knowledge changed this. A solid, inarguable base endured. “If I have\nseen further,” Newton famously wrote, “it is because I have stood on the shoulders\nof giants.” Those shoulders for Netwon were enshrined in libraries, scientific\njournals and the massive sense of what had come before swaddled in the Cambridge\nwalls that surrounded him. In this sense, the preservation and advance of\nknowledge, the new symmetry, was not only the largest shift of power in history. It\nwas also the best thing that ever happened to the human race.\nIn other ways, of course, it was very nearly the worst. Symmetry had a darker edge.\nIt meant that nations decided the strategic questions of the day by throwing\nmassive, deadly power at one another in unprecedented volume. With each passing\nyear, Europe’s engines of science and industry were grinding out tools of\nunprecedented destruction. Napoleon’s greatest victories were enabled as much by\nthe industrial strength of French artillery factories as by the liberated masses of the\nFrench revolution. When France was unseated by the British Empire, it was\nmanufacturing scale and naval depth that tipped the balance. London’s clubby\nmastery was, in turn, challenged by Germany’s efficient, iron-and-blood commercial\nengines. Size and scale and safety became linked. This sense of the undeniable\npower of industrial mass was Winston Churchill’s only comfort for two nervous,\nlonely years after 1939 as he paced the hours until what he hoped was America’s\nentry into The Second World War. “I knew that the United States was in the war, up\n96 Museums, scientific congresses: Joel Mokyr, “The Intellectual Origins of Modern\nEconomic Growth”, The Journal of Economic History, Vol. 65, No. 2 (June 2005) p 290\n97 “All fixed, fast-frozen relations” Karl Marx and Freiderich Engels, “The\nCommunist Manifesto,” in The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 and the\nCommunist Manifesto (Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1988) 212\n70\nto the neck and in to the death,” he wrote the day after Pearl Harbor. “Hitler's fate\nwas sealed. Mussolini's fate was sealed. As for the Japanese, they would be ground\nto a powder. All the rest was merely the proper application of overwhelming\nforce.” 98 Or, the reverse of that coin: Admiral Yamamoto grimly to Emperor\nHirohito: “If you tell me that it is necessary that we fight, then in the first six months\nto a year of war against the U.S. and England I will run wild, and I will show you an\nuninterrupted succession of victories. I must tell you also that, should the war be\nprolonged for two or three years, I have no confidence in our ultimate victory.” 99\nGround to a powder. This was symmetry at its most pounding and decisive. Mass\nagainst mass. This was a picture of power that seemed undeniable in its pure logic.\nUntil now.\nSo how should we think about power in our own age? What picture best captures its\nvibrant, unceasing demands?\nIt might be tempting now, as a first pass, to say we’ve left that world of purely\nsymmetric, mass-against-mass power behind. After all, a few figures, anywhere in\nthe system, can exert massive and even fatal, collapsing pressure. One clever hacker,\none terrorist, one hedge fund manager with a bad idea, even one purely accidental\nmis-connection – never before has so much power accumulated in systems so\nvulnerable to single slips. And our massive power – the US Army or our economy –\nis hardly decisive despite its weight. It seems now that something can grow bigger\nand weaker. A nation may have an ever-larger GDP, but if it is miswired somehow, if\nits social or legal or youthful connections misfire a bit, then it may be still more\nvulnerable. But this “power of a pinprick” asymmetry is not the whole story. Just\nwhen the network looks like a way to tie together all sorts of small, even isolated\nforces and bless them with decisive power, we notice something else. Tremendous,\neven historic and undeniably massive concentrations of power. Platforms like\nFacebook, software systems like Microsoft or search centers like Google are sort of\ndense, impossible-to-replace gold mines. Google answers questions for more than\n50% of the world every day. Is it the most powerful company in human history? Is\nFacebook? And is their power widely distributed? Or is it concentrated in the\nalgorithms and cloud data of these firms? Anyhow, they are among the first of a\ntotally new species of firm.\nThe leap we have to make in understanding our networked age – and by this I don’t\njust mean the Internet, but really any connected system you’d care to consider –\nbegins with this idea: On connected systems, power is defined by both profound\nconcentration and by massive distribution. It can’t be understood in simple either/or\nterms. Power and influence may yet become even more concentrated than it was in\n5.\n98 “Hitler’s fate was sealed”: Winston Churchill, The Second World War: The Grand\nAlliance, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1986) 540\n99 Or the reverse of that coin: Roberta Wohlstetter, Pearl Harbor: Warning and\nDecision (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1962), 349–353.\n71\nfeudal times and more distributed than it was in the most vibrant democracies.\nNetwork power, we might say, exists as a sort of skin or surface that ties together\nbillions of points to each other and to vital, centralized cores. We know our world is\nfilling with more and better and faster connected devices distributing themselves at\nan unmeasureably quick pace; but we are also breeding powerful centralized\nknowledge and computing basins. Biological research labs now engage in complex\nDNA analysis with powerful desktop tools (distribution), but to work efficiently,\nthey demand fast reference to the patterns revealed only in immense genetic\ndatasets (concentration). You can snap high quality videos with your phone\n(distribution); you share them with millions on a connected central stage like\nFacebook or YouTube (concentration). A financial engineer can architect a new and\nprofitable trading instrument on his tablet (distribution), but his hopes for profit\ndepend on instant connection to busy, price-setting markets were prices are set\n(concentration.)\nThis sort of pulling, taffy-like web of ties between small (your watch) and big\n(connected data systems) stretches constantly. It’s what you need to picture when\nyou think of an image of network power. The wired masses in Tahrir square, for\ninstance, emerge like magic on some once-invisible surface that forms between their\nphones and powerful platforms like YouTube. Or: Hyper-linked terrorist groups\nappear from nearly nowhere, jerking recruits from suburban London bedrooms via\nmassively connected messaging platforms. Recall Adam Smith’s line about the\nEnlightenment, how a commercial society was one in which every man had to\nbecome a merchant? Well, in our age of connection, every one of us is a node. We sit\non that tense, stretched surface between center and periphery. When we say\n“connection changes the nature of an object,” this is the exact balance we have to\ncomtemplate. “Social structures,” John Padgett and Walter Powell wrote in their\nmasterful study of complex connected systems, The Emergence of Organizations and\nMarkets, “should be viewed more as vortexes in the flow of social life than as\nbuildings of stone.” 100 This idea has some eerie implications: Every structure –\ncongresses, universities, the company where you work, our minds even – is merely a\ntemporary collection of relations. And of course those relations can change at any\nmoment. The tension between concentration and distribution acts, in a sense, like\nan hydraulic jaw. It pries power out of older, once-legitimate hands.\nConsider the case of my father, a cardiologist. As a doctor he stands at the head of a\nmedical tradition run for thousands of years on the idea that the doctor is the center\nof your care. If you show up at a hospital on a stretcher with a flat-line on some\nheart monitor, my father’s decades of training and practice have always been your\nbest hope. But today, nearly every patient he sees – even the ones he brings back\nfrom their black flat-line future – second-guesses him as soon as he’s out the door:\nGoogling their disease, tapping into websites of mixed reliability, joining some\nonline community of people with the same sickness while they still have tubes in\ntheir nose. Meanwhile, his ideas about your case are under quickening pressure: An\n100 Padgett and Powell, p. 8\n72\nemerging “Internet of DNA”, massive collections of treatment histories, or linked\ndatabases of medical histories will be overseen by machine intelligences able to outdiagnose\nhim. 101 Constant, automatic links between body-borne sensors we’ll wear\n(or swallow) and data centers will sharpen the edge these systems have on my dad\nfurther still in coming years. They will notice things he could never hope to see –\nsmall but portentous changes in your heartbeat, chemical chimeras from new\nmedications, how you’re feeling in each moment until your last.\nIt is the nature of networks that they create both massive concentration and\ndistribution. And in the process they simply rip apart many of our existing\nstructures. Look at our worrisome global economics at the moment. Extreme\nconcentration of wealth on one end and massive distribution of work tools to evercheaper\nsources of labor runs on this exact same logic: it is a sort of jawing network\neffect that is tearing up the middle class, producing an ever-richer elite. Those who\nhave information in financial markets, for instance, possess a secret and vital and\never sharper edge over those who don’t. Which makes them richer still. Which\nsharpens their cutting edge still finer. If we ask ourselves why the world now feels\non the edge of a deflationary shock – a moment where there is more supply than\nthere is demand, where the world waits to buy because “tomorrow it will be\ncheaper” and sends economies spiraling as a result – one reason is this way in which\nnetworks are pulling on our economics. On the one hand, wealth is concentrated in\nfewer and fewer hands by the leverage of knowledge and a head start and\nconnection – a phenomenon known, in fact, as a “rich club” distribution by network\ntheorists. The middle class is locked out of this group. Their wealth and power and\ninfluence declines, as a result. This slashes overall demand, since a billionaire\nconsumes less of each additional dollar than, say, a school teacher. At the same time,\nmassive distribution of technology and connection is reducing demand for labor\nwhile flooding the world with commodities, workers, newly linked-supply of items\nlike bedrooms and car seats.\nThe network effect works its usual jawing destruction here: Connection decreases\ndemand and increases supply. It concentrates capital in a few hands, even as it\ndistributes tools of work to cheaper and more distributed people and machines. The\nmiddle is class torn inexorably apart from both ends. It’s not wrong to wonder, as\nsome economists have, if capitalism is a system best yoked to older, slower\npuritanical values that encouraged saving, not consumption – and to ask if wiring\nmarkets to instant networks is not, in the end like trying to warp speed a carriage.\nAnyhow placing an economy on a network surface produces new, ripping pressures\nas apparent in middle-income nations as they are in middle class households. “We\nare being destroyed,” a South Korean friend said to me about the hollowing out of\nhis national economy. Korean computer and television and compute manufacturers\nhad hoped they could develop their own essential software, that their hardware\nmanufacturing technology would be unmatchable. In fact, software triumph was\n101 Meanwhile, his ideas about your case: I. Akyildiz, Pierobon, M.\nBalasubramaniam, S. Koucheryavy, Y., \"The internet of Bio-Nano things,\"\nCommunications Magazine, IEEE , vol.53, no.3, pp.32-40, March 2015\n73\ndrifting to cores in Silicon Valley and Redmond – a contest between Microsoft and\nApple and Google. And the prized Korean manufacturing excellence was no match\nfor cheap Chinese and then Vietnamese labor welded to assembly-line technology.\nWe see this pattern of network-led shredding nearly everywhere now, the result of\npowerful cores of knowledge and wide distribution of connection. Newspapers –\nremoved from relevancy by crowd-sourced newsfeeds and constantly-connected\nsmart databases. Once indomintable television networks, devoured by cheap homemade\nvideos and large-scale platforms that use the Internet for distribution. Bitcoin\nand other first-generation block-chained currencies eating at the once\nunquestionable authority of central banks. Drones hovering along on a skein of GPS\nand data links are also among the new citizens of this connected skein. They are\nproducts of a data web: They depend on centralized connection and the distribution\nof technology, data, and design. They may do to old ideas of security and power\nwhat the fusion of GPS and smart phones and databases have done to hotel chains or\nmedicine. Massed, self-organized drone fleets can turn aircraft carriers and exposed\nbattle groups from sources of strength into vulnerable and even dangerously selfdefeating\nantiques. They will remake urban landscapes. Think of the way that Baron\nHausman redesigned Paris in the 18 th Century to manage with the Enlightement-age\ndanger of liberated, angry citizens. The creation of the city’s wide boulevards,\ncentral axes for easy movement of the police, and intersections engineered to\nquarantine riots was a reaction against the demands of mass liberty. Our cities are\nnow vulnerable not simply to mass protest risk, but to the pinch of asymmetric\nlevitating drones. The sensations of safety behind walls, up a staircase, inside a\nwindowed room all begin to slip away. Drone risk – and all the potentially\nwonderful elements of constant, instant drone assistance – will command a\nretooling of cities, much as automobiles did a century ago.�\nSo this is power: Cores and distribution. They way that tension pulls particularly on\ncertain, once-essential structures and objects and people explains a lot about our\nage – including the failure of so many institutions. Connectivity changes the nature\nof an object. That’s true for your doctor, your bank account, your army – and for\nbillions of people whose lives alter irreversibly once they connect to markets, to\nknowledge, to the world. To connect now is to be exposed to this fresh young skin of\nlinked power, a lively surface that transports anything at near instant speed. We\nhave to ask just how many of the “scaffolds humans erect” that were essential for\nEnlightenment-era advances will be pulled down. And of course we face the exciting,\nuneasy task of thinking up the new scaffolds we now must build.\nIf you have the tools or the skill to see the world this way, as a vibrating and pulling\nmesh of connections, then you can look at a tanks or soldiers or years of stability\nand see possibility. A friend who controls the largest secure Bitcoin vault in the\nworld, put it to me once this way: “Platforms mattered once; now it is protocols.” His\npoint was that the pipes and rules connecting the varied systems of our world affect,\nfundamentally, the distribution of power. The rules of the Bitcoin blockchain or the\nimplications of a protocol like IPv6 or DNSSSEC reveals something about how we’ll\nall connect in the future. Once these new rules become visible to you, then even the\n74\nmost inarguable current sources of influence and control – the US Dollar, say – look\nweak. The Seventh Sense is defined first by an intuitive feeling for just how power is\nbeing re-geared now. If you look at a kid with a phone and think “Strong”, you have\nthe Seventh Sense. If you look at an angry, barely educated terrorist wannabe and\nthink, “Junior Varsity”, you don't. And as a result you may be about to have a very\nunpleasant surprise.\nTry this: Ball up your right hand and hold it in front of you; now take your left hand\nand open the fingers and hold it a few inches away with your fingers pointing back\ntowards the right. You can think of your left hand as the vibrating, living network of\nconnection – reaching towards the concentrated power that your right hand\nrepresents. This is the heart of understanding our age. Networks live in that tension\nbetween distribution and concentration. To connect any object – my dad, a\nnewspaper, a radio-controlled plastic drone – to this skein is to change, irrevocably,\nits essence. The reason the legitimacy of old leaders is failing, the reason our\nstrategy is incoherent, the reason our age really is revolutionary, is that they are all\nsitting in the midst of these pulling, powerful forces. We should steel ourselves for\nthe shredding imminence of this violence . But also – and you know this already, I\nthink – we must prepare ourselves for the possibility of immense construction.\nNetwork power does not only pull apart. It also creates.\nThis paradox confused me, to be honest, for a long time. Power is, manifestly,\nconcentrated with astonishing efficiency now. And it is more widely dispersed than\never too. We can stare at this difference, this strange polar tension and baffle\nourselves as we try to figure out just how and why it moves. The best way of\nunderstanding this, I finally concluded, requires a cognitive leap, perhaps, over our\nusual Western way of understanding the world as either “a” or “b”, as either\n“distributed” or “concentrated”, and into a view of how opposites might ceaselessly\nbalance into a whole. Not “a” or “b” but “a” and “b” at the same time.\nLet me tell you what I mean: In 1132 the Song Dynasty that had ruled China for\nnearly 200 years collapsed in the face of an invasion by wild Manchurian soldiers\nfrom the northern plains. The Song leadership – along with its best minds and\ncultural figures – fled south from Beijing for a thousand miles, until they were safely\non the opposite bank of the Yangtze River. They settled in a lakeside city we know\ntoday as Hangzhou. In those days Hangzhou was known as Lin’An, which might best\nbe translated as “Gazing at Peace.” The little town must have seemed to the Song\nleaders a perfect respite from the horror and war they had left behind. The city lay\nthen, as it still does, along side XiHu or West Lake, a tranquil and horizon-filling\nstretch of water framed by rolling hills and tea plantations. The famous poet and\nstatesman Su Dongpo later compared gazing at the lake to looking at a beautiful\nwoman – that same fused sense of calm, peace and astonishment you might feel\nwhile considering the object of your own love. Stilled water is regarded in Chinese\nculture – you may recall from Lake Tai Hu where Master Nan set his campus –as a\nreservoir of yin energy. Song leaders had fled the angry yang energy of invasion for\nthe yin peace of the south. Yin energy is associated with calm, femininity, fertility.\nYang expresses action, violence, creation. Yang is the thunderstorm; Yin is the peace\n75\nthat comes afterwards, as the crops absorb water and grow. The idea of a balance of\nyin and yang is among the oldest in Chinese philosophy. “When heaven and earth\nwere formed, they divided into yin and yang,” the Huainanzi, one of China’s greatest\npolitical texts explains. “Yang is generated from yin and yin is generated from yang.”\nHangzhou became a capital of yin. It produced perhaps some of the greatest Chinese\nphilosophy and poetry and art. Greatness emerged from that stillness – and, even\ntoday, to sit by West Lake and drink a cup of the Dragon Well tea produced on the\nnearby hillsides is to have every one of your senses flooded by tranquility.\nThat yin-yang balance gives us, in a sense, a way to understand that split power on a\nnetwork by seeing it is not, really, split. Network power is energetic and wild at the\nends, with all the creative energy of a world filled with devices, empowered human\ndreams, and the violent slips of old balances. Yang. But at the center it is dense, still,\neven quiet with the silently cranking algorithms of massively concentrated power.\nThe computer science pioneer Claude Shannon saw information in 1949 as wild,\nuncertain, and pulsing with the instability of an entropic system. Yang. The machine\narchitect Norbert Weiner, writing at nearly the same moment in 1948, saw the\ndigital age differently – as an expression of stability and structure. Yin. 102 His vision\nfor a digital order, what he called “cybernetics,” emerged from the Greek concept of\nkibernetes – the orderly steering of a ship through sometimes chaotic waters.\nWe now know: the humming webs around us are both. They are ordered and\nstructured. 103 Good and evil. Power in this connected age is concentrated and\ndistributed. Each feeds the other. The crops need the thunderstorm; the\nthunderstorm feeds from the heat radiated off the land. Or: The yang violence of the\nManchurian wars bred the conditions for the yin renaissance in Hangzhou. The\nmassive distribution of connected points creates revolutions, economic disruption,\ncrackling innovation. But it also creates a need for more centralization, more\nagreement on protocols or platforms. This idea of opposites balancing into a whole\nis not unique to Chinese civilization. You can find it too in ancient Greek or Roman\ntradition. Heraclitis, for instance, insisting, “All things are one.” Or in the view that\nthere can be no love without hate, no stillness without chaos, no beauty without the\nunbeautiful and fortunately – as we’re about to see – no destruction without\ncreation.\n102 The computer science pioneer: See D.

RAND was a\ndream destination for many researchers, offering a fusion of patriotism, technology\nand California sun. The place became known for a relaxed, intellectual atmosphere –\nan energy of open creativity that belied the dangerous, nuclear-tipped problems\nsitting inside its locked safes and eager minds. Shortly after settling in, Baran was\ngiven one of the most troubling, deeply secret of these puzzles.\nThe Cold War was then in its early days. The debate over how to manage an age\nwhen it was, for the first time, possible for humans to destroy the planet was\ncolored still by fresh memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was charged too with\nthe fear of communist expansion, not an unreasonable worry for Americans who\nhad just fought a world war against two other, dangerously totalitarian forces. A\ncold fear lingered in the minds of many citizens and military planners: Given a\nwindow of vulnerability, might the USSR loose a fast nuclear attack? Avoiding such a\nrisk became a primary concern of American diplomacy and defense thinking,\nparticularly in the establishment of some sort of deterrent to a Soviet attack.\nMoscow had to know, and trust, that any attempt to strike-first would be met with a\ndevastating reply. “The chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win\nwars,” the nuclear strategist Bernard Brodie wrote in a 1946 memo. “From now on\nits chief purpose must be to avert them.” 104 Deterrence rested on this hope that the\nUSSR would be persuaded not to launch a snap-strike because of the certainty of a\nnation-levelling reply. This logic, this “balance of threat” depended in turn on\nAmerica’s ability to launch such a strike. If the Soviets could wipe out America’s\nability to respond, then Moscow’s leaders might move first, snap of America’s claws,\nand then pick the world apart at their leisure. If Krushchev’s famous, mocking\ndangerous ”We will bury you!” line from 1956 really meant what it said, then such a\nmove would provide an awfully convenient first shovel.\nIn the late 1950s, when Baran arrived at RAND, the Cold War was at its chilliest and\none of the most carefully guarded American secrets was this: If the USSR attacked,\n104 “The chief purpose of our military”: Bernard Brodie, “The Weapon: War in the\nAtomic Age and Implications for Military Policy,” in Brodie Ed, The Absolute Weapon:\nAtomic Power and World Order, (New York: Harcourt Brace and Company, 1946) 76\n77\nthere might be no response. The US, with its priceless collection of bombers and\nmissiles and million-man army, could not strike back for the simple reason that the\nnation’s field officers would have no way to talk to each other, or to commanders in\nWashington. The military radio and telephone systems America depended on for her\nsafety would not likely endure an initial Soviet strike. This was the problem Baran\nhad been told to solve.“At the time we didn’t know how to build a communication\nsystem that could survive even collateral damage by enemy weapons,” he recalled\nlater. RAND determined through computer simulations that the AT&T Long Lines\ntelephone system, a copper web that carried essentially all the nation’s military\ncommunications, would be cut apart by relatively minor physical damage. 105\nThe military had spent, already, a fortune on the problem. (They had spent half a\nfortune, it turned out, trying to hide it.) The result was an expensively designed,\ngorgeously featured telephone network linking military bases to strategic command\nposts. But because the lines and their switching centers were laced out in a pattern\nwith just a few big central nodes, like a bicycle wheel with spokes, it had almost no\nchance of surviving the very thing it was designed to help prevent, a Soviet strike. If\nyou gazed at an inked-out map of this network, with its central hub staffed by senior\ncommanders and then radiating lines out to bases and missile silos, it even looked,\nwell, like a target. If the USSR could bullseye those hubs with a bomb or two, the rest\nof the network would fold. The Soviets could do whatever they wanted: Invade\nBerlin, roll into France, obliterate Los Angeles. America’s military would be deaf.\nAnd as Soviet missiles became more accurate, this seemed an inevitability. “We will\nsoon be living in an era,” Baran wrote, “in which we cannot guarantee survivability\nof any single point.”\nThe situation, as a carefully screened handful of scientists at RAND knew, was in fact\neven more perilous. Shortly before Baran arrived at RAND, scientists testing\nhydrogen bomb designs in the Pacific discovered that radiation from their\nexplosions fuzzed communications for hundreds of miles. A Soviet attack, even if it\n105 “At the time”: There is a fair amount of debate about this question of if the\nInternet design was intended for survivability or if some other systemic need – such\nas linking research institutions – accounted for the distributed architecture that\nemerged. See, for instance, Barry M. Leiner, Vinton G. Cerf, et al, “A Brief History of\nthe Internet”, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review Volume 39 Issue 5,\nOctober 2009, 22-31. However, an examination of primary source documents shows\nthe evolution of Baran’s thinking clearly and produces documentary evidence for\nthe origins of the problem he and various figures at RAND were aiming to solve.\nOthers arrived at the packet switching model, but it is clear Baran’s path to the\ndesign emerged from the security problems he was considering. For much of the\ninformation here see “Oral History: Paul Baran” Interview #378 for the IEEE History\nCenter, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (Available online);\nPaul Baran, “On Distributed Communications I: Introduction to Distributed\nCommunications Networks,” United States Air Force Project RAND (August, 1964);\nBaran “On Distributed Communications XI: Summary Overview,” United States Air\nForce Project RAND (August, 1964)\n78\nmissed those crucial, central AT&T nodes, would still reduce American military\ncommunications to a bunch of hissing, empty phones. “Our communications were so\nvulnerable,” Baran said, “that each missile base commander would face the dilemma\nof either doing nothing in the event of a physical attack, or taking action that would\nmean an all out irrevocable war.” You could, uneasily, picture the moment of\ndecision: Some Colonel alone in his bomb-laden plane over Europe or deep in some\ncornfield missile silo wondering “Launch or not?”. This was a horrifying possibility.\nBaran began to ask: Was there some other way to send a counter-strike signal?\nThere was a sense of life-saving preciousness in such a setting about connectivity\nitself. To hold it, manage it, protect and control it – in the face of the extreme\npressures of a nuclear balance, such connection marked the difference between\nsafety and catastrophe.\n2.\nYou can, at the heart of many revolutions, find the warm hints of human psychology\npressing out. This is the roiling, unscratchable instinct for change that marks a really\nrevolutionary temperament – and that often is the only sort of personality that can\nimagine and then deliver a solution to impossible problems. Conservatives like\nthings as they are, even if “as they are” is sometimes broken or dysfunctional or\ndangerous. Revolutionaries are different. They don’t seem to choose their role. They\nhave a vision for how the world ought to be, a vibrating and instinctive picture of\npower, and driven by passion or anger or faith or some wild genius, they chase that\nvision relentlessly, even into madness. If they are lucky, however, they live in an age\nwhere their crazy hopes catch onto some larger human hunger. Khomeini worried\nthat the Shah would never fall. Lenin was preparing to abandon revolutionary\npolitics in 1916. Jobs was told the iPhone could never be built as he wished. Then, in\nan instant, revolution.\nWe might ask: What set Martin Luther on his revolutionary course to demand\ninstant access to God? Luther would tell you that his first inspiration had come to\nhim one night in the summer of 1505, while he was walking home in a\nthunderstorm, when a lightning bolt landed a foot or two away. 106 Luther had been\nstruggling for years with an inner battle, with a tension between his faith and what\nit demanded of him. Then, when that lightning cracked free from the storm, a\nsensation of total terror was replaced by a new feeling. The nearness and power of\nGod snapped past him in that moment. It clarified everything. He dropped his law\nstudies the next day and within a year he was an Augustinian monk, preaching –\noften hundreds of sermons a year, ever angrier, ever clearer – about the closeness of\nGod, the real, tangible, bolt-from-the-blue passage of faith to faith. He was totally,\ncompletely converted.\n106 Luther would tell you: Albert Beutel “Luther’s Life” in Ed. Donald K. McKim, The\nCambridge Companion to Martin Luther (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n2003) 4\n79\nLong before Paul Baran dreamed up the networks that were required to solve the\n“deaf, dumb and blind bomber pilot” challenge, he lived through the sort of moment\nthat left an indelible psychological mark – one that remains visible in the revolution\nhe made, as Luther’s lightning-bolt of faith is in the unadorned churches and simple\nliturgy of Lutheranism. Baran was born in Grodno, Poland in 1928. His father had an\nuneasy sense about what was coming to Europe and he moved the family to America\nwhen Paul was six. Pesach Baran became Paul Bran in America, a model student, a\nprize-winning mathematician and eventually at Hughes and Rand he established\nhimself as one of the great American engineers of his generation. And like so many\nrefugees of that era, the sharp, irreversible exodus left him with a question. How,\nexactly, to stay connected – to family, to tradition, to history? As the murderous mist\nof Nazism swept over Europe, the problem took on a searching urgency: How to\nmaintain a connection, any connection, in the face of utter catastrophe? As he neared\nretirement decades later, Baran recalled his life’s work with this resonant line: “I\nwas concerned,” he said, “with survivability.” The problem that animated his life as\nmuch as it did his networks.\nTwo years after arriving at RAND, Baran began to discern the outlines to a solution\nto the dangerous problem of American military communications. In a series of\nlectures for Air Force officers starting in the summer of 1961, Baran began working\nhis way towards an answer, speech by speech and equation by equation. He didn’t\nfully know where he was heading when he began the talks, he said, but he had an\ninstinct that some other design must be out there, some completely fresh way to\nhandle the “survivability problem” and by the end of his lecture tour, he had found\nit.\nBaran’s new design for a durable network had begun with an idea that didn’t work.\nThe Pentagon, he’d thought, might broadcast thousands of coded messages over AM\nradio frequencies all at once as an attack approached. “We interrupt this program to\nsay: It’s Christmas in July!” Missile silo commanders and bomber commanders\nwould cluster by their transistor radios, collecting a “launch” code with the ease of\nlistning to a late-night baseball game. That target-shaped, “Just Aim Here” web of\nphone lines would be replaced by something far more distributed, harder to wipe\nout with a single Semyorka-7 missile shot. But this approach had problems too. It\nrelied fatally on broadcast towers and on insecure AM radio waves. But the idea of\nsuch a widespread, insidiously untargettable network got Baran thinking. Sending\nout the messages and letting them find their own way had a lot of appeal, if it could\nbe done. There would be no central hubs. Information would sail over linked lines in\nthe way radio signals moved in the air. Military communications, in Baran’s system,\nwould bounce from point to point on this tapestry, at each stop being re-directed\ntowards their intended destination. The resulting network, if you drew it out, would\nlook like a fishnet: Lots of links connected to a few knotted nodes. And because the\nbundles of data, Baran called them packets, could be moved by the network itself,\nyou could cut or nuke or sabotage the net in a few places and still use it. The packets\nwould would find another path. Even a badly ripped up and irradiated network\ncould, in theory, carry a “launch” – or a recall – message safely from the White House\nto a bomber pilot.\n80\n“The early simulations,” Baran recalled, “showed that after the hypothetical network\nwas 50% instantly destroyed, the surviving pieces of the network reconstituted\nthemselves within a half a second.” That was a way of saying that his messages were\nfinding new routes on the network even after huge parts of the system had been\ntaken off line. And they were doing it nearly instantly. Better still, as he began to\nmodel these fishnet, “distributed” networks, Baran discovered that they were not\nonly capable of surviving attack, they were also incredibly efficient. “If built and\nmaintained at a cost of $60 million (1964 Dollars),” he calculated, his design would,\n“handle the long distance telecommunications within the Department of Defense\nthat was costing the taxpayer about $2 billion a year.”\nBaran travelled the country for most of 1961 and 1962, classified presentation and\nslide-rules in hand, trying to persuade skeptical generals, engineers and other\nscientists. It was, he found, a nearly impossible task. He recalled a visit to the\ntowering AT&T switching headquarters on Thomas Street in Lower Manhattan. It\nwas,an implacable temple of the high-priests of hub-and-spoke network design.\nThat one building handled more telephone and telex traffic than nearly any other\nsingle point on earth. Surely the place was very high on the USSR first-strike list for\nexactly that reason. So Baran expected a friendly reception. After all, he’d be telling a\nbunch of men with a uranium death sentence that he’d found a way to get them off\nthe Soviet target list. His new “mesh” network would mean that bombing AT&T\nwould be largely pointless. It wouldn’t blind US commanders. If only they’d redesign\ntheir network, the AT&T engineers might save their own lives. They thought he was\ninsane.\n“I tried to explain packet switching to a senior telephone company executive. In midsentence\nhe interrupted me, “ Baran recalled. “The old analog engineer looked\nstunned. He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up,\nsending a signal of his utter disbelief. He paused for a while, and then said, ‘Son,\nhere’s how a telephone works….’” Of course Paul Baran knew how a telephone\nworked. You jacked one point to a switch to another point. That was the problem.\nThis was why AT&Ts design would be absolutely useless in the face of the\ncatastrophe he’d been told to prevent. Baran was, nerve and blood and bone, as an\nanalyst, and even as a refugee perhaps, alive with the imperative of survivability, of\nhow connection might mean the difference between war and peace. Those morons\nin the AT&T building? What the hell could they be worrying about?\nBut it wasn’t just that $2 billion annual check from the US Defense Department those\nwizened phone wizards were seeing vanish in Baran’s fishnet, it was a whole way of\nthinking. The AT&T scientists wanted to control the addresses, the routes, the\ntiming of messages from the center. This sort of authoritarian design appeared more\nefficient to them; perhaps it was even more psychologically comfortable since it\nmatched their own experience of being commanded and controlled. Karl Wittfogel,\nthe historian who identified the water totalitarians of ancient China or Egypt, would\nhave recognized them: Switch Despots! “We had arrived at a conceptual impasse,”\nBaran reflected with the mild confidence of a man who knows he will eventually\n81\nwin. He moved onto the next stop. Same result. And the next. Same result. Eventually\nBaran’s engineering colleagues back at RAND were so affronted by the routine\ndismissal of his logic that they spoke up. They had seen the classified briefings. They\nknew just how easily the nation could be hobbled – and their Santa Monica building\nwas surely on some target list somewhere too. RAND’s scientists demanded a\ndetailed, critical study of the “distributed network model”. By the time they were\nfinished, the Air Force was preparing to begin construction.\nSurvivability. Plucked from that impossible looking puzzle was the first honestly\ndistributed network. You can sense the power of this inversion: A network with no\ncentral control, survivable, uncuttable. The earliest large network built on the\nBaran’s principles became known as ARPANET, the Advanced Research Project\nAgency NETwork – a mesh of connections that, even today, serves as the backbone\nfor parts of the Internet. Even with the risk of nuclear war (hopefully) long gone,\npacket switching networks of one sort or another still account for most of the data\nmoving in the world. Think of how true, how heat-hardened and useful an idea must\nbe to endure more than fifty years of technological change. And all the efficiencies\nBaran first predicted 50 years ago on his slide rules are still at work. Every time you\nmake a call, share a video or ask a machine to think for you, that whole transaction\nlikely takes place through fishnet routed packets. If we had stayed with that old\nAT&T model, we’d be living in a different world. Riots would be flipped off with a\nsingle switch. Data flows would be monitored with the ease of watching a subway\nturnstile. The far flung, wild creativity of our plug-and-play connected world would\nbe stilted, stifled. Each additional connection to the system would demand\nbureaucratic central approval by the Switch Despots, concerned more with their\nown power more than their survival. Instead, we have a slice-resistant mesh that\nhas grown by a billion times over, with its original architecture largely intact.\nPacket switched systems such as the Internet mean that anyone with some string\nand an ability to tie knots (which, in tech-speak, is anyone with some blinking fiber\noptics and a TCP/IP connection) can add themselves into the global web. They can\nconnect. They can share. Practically, this is why you can so easily snap your phone\nor tablet on and touch, more or less instantly, a whole world of data. Every minute\nnow an additional 10,000 devices are connected to the Internet. Medical tools,\nBitcoin mines, airplane diagnostic systems – and of course wired citizens, smartphones\nand laptops and tablets. This ease of connection is an implicit part of a\nSeventh Sense worldview. Anyone can connect. It’s as fundamental as Luther’s “Let\nanyone can speak to God.” Or Kant’s “Dare to know.” When someone says “Why\nwould anyone want to share photos with the world?” or “Why would you ever hand\nyour DNA over?” they are missing the point that many objects now are only\ncomplete or useful once they’re connected. When we say “connection changes the\nnature of an object” we’re nodding towards the idea that constant connection is\nalmost a kind of right�for devices and programs and people. Anyhow, it is certainly\na kind of yearning.\nWhen we described network power as stretched between distribution and\nconcentration, we should understand too that it is this design of Baran’s that\n82\npermits the easy spread and accumulation of links.Terror cells or social networks or\nfinancial markets all lay out in this fashion. Wide-open, convenience-making links\nare expanding, and they serve as a kind of global nervous system, more sensitive\nwith each passing generation. These lines of connection run two ways, of course:\nNetworks permit any of us to connect to nearly anywhere, and to unimaginable\ntechnological power. But, at the same time, the world connects back to us. Wired\njihadis and currencies and bio bits – they’re all tied in with us too. So yes: We’re\nmurdering the exotic with our data connections and machines and discount plane\nflights. Should we be surprised when, from time to time now, the exotic shows up\nand murders us right back?\nWe’ve seen, now, the way in which that pulling connection between center and\nperiphery – that tension of our network – pulls apart old structures. And this is the\nfirst, urgent Seventh Sense understanding: Connection changes the nature of an\nobject by placing it on this tense mesh. Connect a patient, a doctor, a flying machine,\na currency – each is twisted and changed as a result. Some become great. Others\nsnap, never to be rebuilt. Some adjust, painfully. The pulling network action\naccounts for our greatest new fortunes but also the tumbling of old ideas and\ninstitutions. This is why our age is so uneasy. This is also part of the picture of\nnetwork power we have to keep in mind, the image of a stretched skein plucking\napart old structures. Baran’s fishnet grows, it locks everything it touches into a new\nstructure, one that resists the “arrest the usual suspects” sort of interruption. We’ve\nsaid: Connection changes the nature of an object. To be connected to a Baran-style\nsystem instead of a brush-cut 1950’s AT&T system makes a difference.\nThe connected devices themselves are constantly improving. Back in Baran’s day,\ndozens of scientists counted themselves lucky to share a single computer. A few\ndecades later, the PC revolution gave everyone their own machine. And now, of\ncourse, we each have many computers in our lives: phones, wired TVs, computers.\nBecause of connection, we have access to thousands of such devices in data\ncenters. 107 We can touch them in an instant, a fusion of software and hardware and\nconnection that we are starting to know lean on as “everyware.” This now\ncommonplace magic was formalized back in 1965 by Gordon Moore, one of the\nfounding engineers at Intel, who noticed the rather amazing fact that since the\nintroduction of integrated chips in 1959, the number of transistors on each tiny chip\nhad been doubling every two years. 108 It seemed hard to imagine this pace could\nendure, but then it did and does, something known as Moore’s Law. Back in 1997\nAndy Grove, who followed Moore as CEO of Intel, the chip giant, was named TIME’s\nMan of the Year. I wrote that story and I remember Grove telling me, in a\nconfessional spirit: “I never stopped thinking about the business. I worked\n107 And now, of course: Richard Harper, Tom Rodden, Yvonne Rogers and Abigail\nSellen Eds. Being Human: Human-Computer Interaction in the year 2020, (Redmond:\nMicrosoft Research Publication 2008)\n108 This now commonplace magic: Chris Mack, “The Multiple Lives of Moore’s\nLaw: Why Gordon Moore’s grand prediction has endured for 50 years”, IEEE\nSpectrum (March 30, 2015), accessible online.\n83\nconstantly. But when Gordon Moore left the office, he left the work. Mostly he’d go\nfishing.” Moore had the certain confidence of a man who had spotted one of the\nfundamental laws of our age, the compression of computing power and cost. He had\nthe “Let’s go fish” air of a man who had seen the inevitable. Grove, who as CEO had\nto match the wild speed Moore’s Law suggested, had the total unease of a man\naware of just how fast a pace the inevitable was setting. Competition was\neverywhere. One mistake sustained for six months could kill the entire, multi-billion\ndollar business. It had happened to other firms. Often. Grove’s motto was best\ncaptured in the title of one of his books. Only The Paranoid Survive. Each man was\nright in his way. Moore’s law makes ever cheaper and more functional devices\nspread. But Grove’s famous anxiety was honestly earned too: So much speed. So\nmuch connection. Paranoia does seem the best reaction.\nYou have to wonder what that eye-rolling AT&T senior telecommunications\nengineer who so mindlessly lectured Baran would have made of this new world. The\nold New York City temple of phone switches where they met in 1961 has been\nremade into a luxury condominium now. The company’s impregnable billions of\ndollars of long distance revenue were eroded and then basically destroyed by free\npacket-switched services running along the Internet. Son, let me tell you how a phone\nworks. What must Baran have really thought? Massive, widespread connection\nchanged everything. Including how a phone works. Baran eventually left RAND. He\nfounded several of the most important (and lucrative) companies of the early\nInternet. Years later he understood with more precision what exactly had happened:\nThe real risk to those vulnerable AT&T systems wasn’t Russian missiles. It was an\ninformation bomb of sorts, a concatenating desire for constant connection that\nexploded many old tools of control. Yes, it took out the old structures. But, because\nof the very way it was architected, for survivability, it had a remarkable feature that\neven Baran had not quite expected: It enabled each of us to create too.\n3.\nWe’re surrounded by so many networks now where relations and ties of all sorts\nproduce a constant, hard-to-predict, “I never thought of that before,” dynamism. Of\ncourse you have to pity those AT&T wizards a bit. Let me tell you how a stock market\nworks. Or let me tell you how a biologist works. None of these have quite the same\nanswer as they would have two unconnected decades ago. Economies, ecosystems\nor our politics or immune systems are charged with this energy of expanding\ncomplexity. Innocuous looking devices or people take on peculiar, sometimes\ndangerous aspects when connectedLinked networks of money or people or bugs\ntumble into wildness over and over, in ways we can’t quite anticipate or explain..\n“There are systems of crucial interest that have so far defied accurate simulation,”\nthe scientist John Holland observed in a famous paper that helped establish the\ndiscipline of “Chaos Science”. 110 Holland spent years considering these puzzling,\nhard-to-model systems and spotted at least one regularity: Whether it was webs of\n110 “There are systems”: John Holland, “Complex Adaptive Systems”, Holland, John,\nDaedalus; Winter 1992; 121, 1, p. ; Research Library pg. 17\n84\nfinance like the futures exchange or immunological networks or our own brains,\nhighly-connected systems shared what Holland labeled an “evolving structure” –\nthey never stayed the same. They seemed to shift, with an easy plasticity, in\nresponse to internal pressures or external changes. In the process, they took on new\nforms. In many cases, they became better, stronger, more adaptively fit. It wasn’t\nsimply that the unexpected appeared, it was that the systems were evolving. We\ntalked earlier about how political and economic ideas like serfdom or divine right\nfade into history as new forms – a congress, a stock market – are born to replace old\nones. Holland thought the world filled with such evolutions, no different than\nspecies adjusting (or not) to a hotter climate or some fast new predator. He called\nthe networks that produce these sorts of innovations “Complex Adaptive Systems”.\nWhen Holland chose the word “complex” he was making an important distinction.\nComplicated mechanisms can be designed, predicted and controlled. Jet engines,\nartificial hearts or your calculator are complicated in this sense. They may contain\nbillions of interacting parts, but they can be laid out and repeatedly, predictably\nmade and used. They don’t change. Complex systems, by contrast, can’t be so\nprecisely engineered or guessed at with much real certainty. They are hard to fully\ncontrol. Human immunology is complex, in this sense. The World Wide Web is\ncomplex. A rainforest is complex: It is made up of uncountable buzzing, connecting\nbugs and birds and trees. 112 Order, to the extent it exists in the Amazon basin,\nemerges moment-by-moment from countless, constant interactions. The uneven\nsymphonic sound of L’heure Blue, that romantic stopping point at dawn when the\nnight retreats bug by bug and you can hear the forest wakeing bird by bird is the\nsound of complexity engaging in a never-the-same-twice phase transition.\nThe word “complex” comes to us from the Latin world plex, which nods at the\ninterwoven, layered nature of any object 113 . What looks simple – a flower, our skin,\nthe value of a dollar bill – is in fact plexus, loaded with twitches and influences. In\nthat stitching of new links, countless interactions sort of inevitably hiccup into\nunexpected states and ideas and objects: financial panics or disease epidemics,\nbanks and revolutions. Traffic during rush hour is a complex system like this – the\natomic, moving bits of the system, of cars and pedestrians and bicycles together\ndetermine the ultimate state of the system: jammed or no. Los Angles at 5 p.m. on a\nFriday isn’t designed centrally; it’s honking and confused and aggravated rush hour\nlogic appears – slightly different every day – from interaction. . As any system fills\nout with more actors and more types of connection, it becomes more complex and\nharder to predict. Complicated systems don’t produce uncertainty in this same way;\nappealingly, they just run. Strapping a complicated object to the wing of a passenger\nplane makes sense, even if it takes decades of refinement to real reliability. A\ncomplex object? Not so wise.\n112 A rainforest: Simon A. Levin, Fragile Dominion: Complexity and the Commons,\n(Reading, Mass.: Perseus Books, 1999)\n113 The word: Carlos Gershenson, “The Implications of Interactions for Science and\nPhilosophy”, arXiv:1105.2827v1, May 13, 2011\n85\nMost of our networked world is a pool of buzzing, fresh interaction – not only hard\nto predict, but constantly on the sharp edge of making something new. Scientists\nlike Holland call this “emergence”, the way that bottom-up interactions – between\ncells or chips or traders or cars – create a larger order, often something that was not\nthere before. The fundamental uncertainty of this process means it’s often excluded\nfrom the way we look at the world. It’s easier to assume a predictable, linear,\ncomplicated logic is at work. An “a leads to b and c” sort of logic: revolution leads to\nfreedom which leads to democracy, for instance. That such predictions are often\nwrong – and that we’re so often surprised by events in economics or politics – is a\nreminder that compicated systems are often complex, lit with mechanisms that\nalmost gleefully snap off the fingers of meddling, confident planners. Too often we\nlook at some puzzle – Iraq, income inequality – and think it is merely “complicated.”\nWe should know better. “Macro models failed to predict the crisis and seemed\nincapable of explaining what was happening to the economy in a convincing\nmanner,” the European Central Banker Jean-Claude Trichet lamented in the\naftermath of 2008s cascading, complex financial crises, when markets and officials\ndiscovered that the problem with their system was not merely that it was “too big to\nfail” but also “too connected to manage” – and possibly “too complex to\ncomprehend.” Trichet sounded a little shell-shocked. “As a policy maker during the\ncrisis I found the available models of little help. In fact, I would go further: In the\nface of the crisis, we felt abandoned by the conventional tools.” 114\nThis sense of abandonment comes from an attempt to use a mechanical way of\nthinking in age of complexity. 115 When you think an air force can simply pound an\ninsurgency to sand or that some old reliable business should survive because it rests\nupon billions of dollars of infrastructure, you miss the energetic creative and\ndestructive power of complex connection. It’s not fully right to say: Networks\nalways beat hierarchies, because of course networks have layers and structures of\ntheir own. But it’s not wrong to consider that complex systems tear easily at stiff,\ncompetitive and overly-ordered ones, even the most carefully engineered\ncomplicated ones. Think of the mafnicently ornamented dictatorships pushed to\ncollapse in recent years. Or, can you really look at the firm where you work and feel\na sense of living, flexible adaption in the face of connection?\nIn our age, the pressure of emerging change is particularly heightened by the very\nnature of the digital devices themselves. The connected and algorithmic tools all\naround us now lend themselves to the easy and cooperative interaction. In fact, that\n114 Macro models: Jean-Claude Trichet “Reflections on the nature of monetary\npolicy non-standard measures and finance theory”, Speech at ECB Central Banking\nConference, Frankfurt, 18 November 2010\n115 This sense of abandonment: Michele Catanzaro and Mark Buchanan, “Network\nOpportunity.” Nature Physics Vol 9, March 2013 p. 121-122 or Cesar A. Hidalgo,\n“Disconnected!

Such adjustability is what forces app\ncompanies, gaming businesses, or phone companies onto an exhausting treadmill of\nconstant upgrade. Interaction between the pieces of a system, every bit as much as\ndesign or mechanical manipulation, is the reason why change happens. 118\nEntrepreneurs mix GPS and phones to create a new business of tracking everything\nfrom our cars to our children. Algorithmic trading programs engineer completely\nvirtual portfolios – you can buy the S&P Index but as your manager to strip out any\nperformance from tobacco and gun companies, for instance. Or: Terrorists meet\nonline and swap data. Some of the most astonishing systems of our new world have\ngrown up this way. Google’s back-end search systems, for instance, were not “topdown”\ndesigned so much as they emerged, competed and evolved to deliver onceunimaginable\nloads of data. No one at Google is “The Architect.” There is no central\napproval for technology systems. Complexity and unpredictability and emergence\nare regarded as the best way to grow. 119\nLong before the idea of a smart phone or 3D goggles, the British mathematician\nAlan Turing anticipated their arrival when he dreamed of what he called a\n“universal device” 120 : A notional box that, starting from the ones and zeros of\ndigitized data, could be constructed to do anything. Since everything can ultimately\nbe reduced to a binary encoding, nearly any sort of data can be shared, studied,\ncombined or remixed. This easy programmability of so many objects around us now\nis why our world now is more complex than, say, a world of interconnected rail cars\nor ships might have been. Rail cars and ships don’t change much, and certainly not\ninstantly. In the digital world, however, many of the most essential objects and\nnodes can be flipped around like digital Lego, connected in different ways. And\nbecause they are increasingly “always on”, they are also always changing and\nadjusting to what happens elsewhere on the network. This is true for some new\noperating system dumped onto your phone that makes it more intelligent as it is for\nan algorithm placed into a commodity market that causes unexpected chaos.\n116 In fact; Paul Phister, “Cyberspace: The Ultimate Complex Adaptive System”, The\nInternational C2 Journal, Vol 4, No. 2 2010-2011\n117 Your data-enabled phone: Gershenson, p4\n118 Interaction between: Paul Dourish, Where the Action Is: The Foundations of\nEmbodied Interaction, (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2001) 4\n119 Complexity and unpredictability: Randy Shoup speech “Service architectures\nat scale: Lessons from Google and Ebay”, on infoq.com, July 14, 2015\n120 Long before: S. B. Cooper and J. Van Leeuwen, Alan Turing: His Work and Impact.\n(Waltham, MA: Elsevier, 2013)\n87\nWe said earlier that the Seventh Sense is tuned to spot the unsettling ripples that\ncome from this fact: Connection changes the nature of an object. Doctors and voters\nand machines now sit, we’ve seen, on that stretched skin that links central and\ndistributed power. This changes the nature of these nodes. A connected doctor is\ndifferent than an unconnected one. Well, here is another insight we should know:\nThe simple, benign looking act of connection makes complicated objects into\ncomplex ones. The moment an object clicks into a network, it is subject to all the\nwildness of complexity that may lie there: cascades, whipping external forces,\nunexpected internal faults revealed only under the pressure of connection. Cargo\npackages. Shares of stock. Linked to a whole system of constant evolution, even the\nmost innocent looking point is subject to distant twitches, infections or liberating\ninnovations. They become, as a result, complex. That old lemma of parenting –\nYou’re only as happy as your least happy child – can be laid upon our devices. You’re\nas complex as the most complex device you’re linked to.\nLinkage to a complex network is like the difference between a boxed and a pluggedin,\nturned-on blender: one is dormant, one is spinning with a wild and dangerous\nenergy. Connection can change the essence of a whole system if it is designed in\ncertain ways, as complex forces work on what looks stable. It can, for instance, take\nonce pliant, cooperative systems, people and tools and make them competitive. 121\nJack an aspiring college graduate into a world where complex systems rip at his\nfinances, his data and his beliefs and you can end up with a crack in his values, a\nmove from aspiring middle class member to who knows what: nationalist, inventor,\ncommunist, bitcoin banker. “I had no idea my doctor/aircraft carrier/phone/hedge\nfund could do that!” is our common sort of surprise. Contagions, avalanches, tipping\npoints, feedback loops, infections – connectivity exposes us all to these forces.\n“Everthing depends on everything else,” the mathemarical theorist Eugene Stanley\nhas observed of highly connected systems 122 . On networks that hover apart, isolated\nfrom each other, small failures in one spot trigger limited damage 123 . But on highly\nconnected systems, tiny failures tumble around, breaking things.\nNetworks turn everything they touch from complicated to complex. Once a mesh of\nconnection is really flowing, it creates. Networks cause things to happen, in this\nsense. New businesses, new fortunes, new ideas. Castell’s social protests emerged in\nthis way, appearing like condensate in the cooling jar of the post-2008 economic\ncrisis and then spreading, improving, evolving in scale and ambition faster than\nmost traditional politicians could track. Researchers following in his wake studied\nthe Spanish 15M demonstrations of 2011 and found it was composed largely of new,\n121 It can, for instance: Martin Nowak, Evolutionary Dynamics: Exploring the\nEquations of Life (Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press,\n2006)\n122 “Everything depends on”:“Treading Softly in a Connected World”, Quanta\nMagazine, Mar 18, 2013 by Natalie Wolchover\n123 On networks: Sergey V. Buldyrev, et al. “Catastrophic cascade of failures in\ninterdependent networks”, Nature 464, 1025-1028 (15 April 2010)\n88\nyoung organizations that blossomed from connectivity. Other Spanish protest\ngroups, such as labor, anti-abortion activists or regional separatists, relied on\ndecades-old organizations. 15M – like Occupy Wall Street or pieces of the Arab\nSpring or Al-Qaeda – relied on groups fresh-born into a hollow, worried political\nvacuum. A survey of 15M members looked like a review of new Internet companies:\nYoung, wired, vividly unplugged from history and impossible to understand without\ntheir constant connection. They were built by leaching people away from traditional\nparties, the appeal was both the potential of the new and the chance to get away\nfrom the rotting smell of old politics, surely an instinct many of us feel now. 124 This\nis one reason it’s wrong to look at the world and consider it filled merely with\nrandom events, with Black Swans. In fact, regularities and patterns appear many\nplaces on the mesh of connection that surrounds us. They can be searched and\nmapped and studied with the tools of data science, but of course they can also be\nfelt. They may surprise you if you don’t know how to look for them. But the\nregularities are there. Human history is not only made of earthquakes.\n4.\nEven if it can’t be predicted, complexity in any system, whether it is an Indonesian\ncoral reef or a Russian computer network, can at least be measured. How many\npoints are connected? How quickly and deeply do they interact? It is the\nmultiplication of connection that produces a complex landscape. There won’t be\nmuch emergence in a desert, for instance. You alone, unconnected: one point. You\nonline: Several billion. The essential benefit of many points connected in real time is\nthat they are an extremely fast feedback loop. This fine-tuning of action-reaction\nforces them to adapt and adjust quickly, as if they were runners with a coach\nconstantly at their side. Compare the feedback loop of a marching Cairo street\nprotest to, say, the feedback loop of the old men around Mubarak. One was capable\nof grabbing a new techniques and ideas in real time. The other stuck in a molasses\nhaze of old, sweet, slowing ideas. Faced with rapid change, a fast-adapting system\nwill nearly always perform a slow one.\nWhen we say that networks can and will devour hierarchies this is one reason. All\nthe businesses that have been devoured by technology firms in recent years failed to\nadjust fast enough. Network systems are more complex, their “org charts” are an\nunnerving mess as a result of their speed. But under the mess is efficiency, growth,\ninnovation. Such systems can tip into failure easily, of course. But they also can\nadjust their fitness before it is too late. The design of such systems becomes, then, a\nmatter of decisive power. And most of our essential systems now are designed for a\nslower age. Refiguring the global financial system for an age of instant linkage was\none of the crucial conceptual puzzles of the 2008 crisis. Have we done that yet for\nour taxes? Our voting? Our biological security? The chaos of those few weeks in the\nmarkets in 2008 revealed new geographies of finance and speed, a mechanism that\nhad been wired to produce fortune for a few and to inspire, as a result, regulatory\n124 They were built: See Bennett and Segerberg, “The Logic of Connective Action,”\n759\n89\ndesperation in men like Trichet. I’m pretty sure we’ll see versions of this same sort\nof crisis in many other areas.\nMore complexity produces more interaction, as you would expect. More pieces of a\nsystem rushing and touching and changing each other in a perpetual and\naccelerating dance. That process pushes, in turn, still more emergence. The easier it\nis to combine things the more creativity is tickled into life. 125 You hear an amazing\nmashup of the Bee Gees and Michael Jackson; you download the tools to make your\nown. In every aspect of the connected world, growing complexity breeds emergence.\nThis is true in finance, in terrorism, in bio-development. Some intellectuals and\nbusinessmen worry that we’ve arrived at the “End of Innovation” now. But this is\nunlikely. Connected systems, almost as if they have a mind of their own, create and\nsurprise. The complex meshes of connection growing around us now, in a sense, are\nlike a rainforest. They hold and breed and support a range of species native to the\nconnected climate – things that couldn’t survive elsewhere, that were unimaginable\nin an age without connection. Smart medical prediction devices. Apps on your\nphone. Autonomous military robots. Self-driving cars. And we know that, lingering\nahead of us now, as well, are a series of technological leaps that will breed still faster\ninteraction and creation: Quantum computing, for instance, may yet push computer\nto speeds to 100 billion times faster than what is achievable with older technology.\nSelf-taught, reasoning artificial intelltigence will spot patterns invisible to human\nminds, they will offer everythying from computer-assisted explanation to whole\nnew theories of physics and math 126 . And autonomous robotic systems will press\ninto realms where our soft human frame cannot survive – deep underwater\nbiological cracks, for instance, or hot molecular material mixes. More data will flow\nback at us from each of these pipes. 127 And as it arrives it will give us an even more\ngranular sense of our links to the world – and how they might be manipulated for\nstill more invention. “Many biological and social theories were impossible to test\nbecause of lack of data,” one team of cyber-systems researchers noted. “Now we\nhave not only the data, but the methods to analyze it.” The result, they add with a\nfast breath of relief that could be laid upon many sciences or theories we’ve\nsqueezed from limited data: “We are recovering from extreme reductionism in\nscience.” 128\nWhen we say the network “wants” something, it’s a useful anthropomorphism: A\nbillion connected users want to be linked, so Facebook emerges. A trillon web pages\ndemand to be searched, so Google appears. Making such ties produces, first, that\n125 The easier it is to combine things: See Eric Schmidt, “Conversation with Eric\nSchmidt hosted by Danny Sullivan” at Search Engine Strategies Conference, August 9,\n2006.p.1-2 2013 Nathaniel W.

Once that’s done,\nhowever, once the mesh of distribution and connection is in place and growing, then\nemergence begins. The completely new appears. This is why the most successful\ninvestors or leaders of our era have a near pathological desire to push and break old\nsystems. They do this because they have a faith, an instinct, that if they shove hard\nenough to snap an equilibrium, then something else will emerge. They are right.\nThey have all the laws of physics and history behind them. In commerce, the\ndestruction of old business models breeds new ones. In terrorism, brutal violence is\nmore useful than bottled anger; it’s a tool to speed the viral emergence of chaos\n(and, some hope, a new politics). What emerges from change? Fresh structures,\ngates that connect us and bind us .If the Seventh Sense features a nearly wild desire\nto smash old equilibriums it is because of the total confidence that something else\nwill emerge.\nLater in life, turning to a philosophical view, Paul Baran said that his webs,\ndistributing themselves around the world with such smooth and relentless energy,\nwere reflecting a kind of inevitable progress, a propensity of linked things to keep\nlinking. Even if he did not see and name our world exactly, he likely could have\npredicted it. “Every object in the universe,” he once wrote, “is connected (by\ngravity/radiation vectors) to every other object.” We know now just how much\ntruth is buried in Baran’s almost philosophical words. Objects and people and places\nnow feed data constantly into the network and to each other. This presses them to\nevolve, to change, to connect again. It is simply a matter of time before those\nconnections bubble up into our real lives to change our economy, our security and\nour leaders. That kludgey, parenthetically weird phrase of Baran’s – wired together\n“(by gravity/radiation vectors)” – tells us a lot. The spread of links is like gravity\nnow. It is like radiation. Irresistible. All–penetrating and revealing the deep human\ntruth in Baran’s Holocaust-bred instincts: To survive and to connect are really the\nsame thing.\n91\nChapter Six:\nWarez Dudes\nIn which the Seventh Sense reveals a secret, dangerous architecture of connection.\n1.\nIt was my second overseas trip. I blinked my eyes as dawn broke over Europe and\nseeped inside the airplane. We began our descent into Amsterdam. I changed the\ntapes inside my Walkman. Something a bit more upbeat seemed right. Peter Gabriel.\nIt was 1993. August.\nEarlier that spring I’d heard about a plan for a giant summer computer hacking\nconference that would be held outside Amsterdam. “Hacking at the End of the\nUniverse” it was to be called. I can’t recall now where I had picked up news of the\ngathering, but it appealed to me immediately. I’d just moved to New York and had\nbeen dipping into the city’s hacking scene. The “scene” was less a boiling, hip hive of\naction than a group of computer amateurs, curious hangers on and early IT system\nengineers who would gather in the grubby basement of the Citicorp Building on 53 rd\nStreet and Lexington some days after work to discuss various techniques for\ntricking digital systems of all types. Hacking didn't have a deeply nefarious\nconnotation in those days; it was seen by most of us as a natural, even a healthy\nextension of an interest in computers. The Internet had about 10 million users at the\ntime. The idea that, two decades later, it would connect more than three billion\npeople or that it would put millions of dollars into the pockets of some of the people\ngathering in that basement was honestly unthinkable.\nThe bible of the group was a thin, irregularly stapled, photocopied magazine\npublished out on Long Island by a guy who used the nom-de-hack of Emmanuel\nGoldstein, the hero of George Orwell’s novel 1984. The magazine was called “2600:\nThe Hacker Quarterly” and it offered a compilation of ideas about how to fool\naround with systems of all sorts, from Atari gaming consoles to door locks. The\nname “2600” came from one of the earliest hacks any of us at those little meetings\nknew about, a famous 1970’s trick that involved using an audio tone at exactly 2600\nhertz (about the pitch of a truck’s backup warning) to force the backbone routing\nswitches of the AT&T phone system to give up access to an “operator mode” which\nwould let the phone hacker – they were called phreakers – make any sort of call for\nfree. The hack didn’t really offer much practical pleasure except a chance to make\nfree phone calls anywhere in the world. Once you’d mastered the trick you pretty\nquickly discovered there wasn't really anyone in Bombay you wanted to call\nanyhow.\nThe real appeal, the deeper joy of the game, was different: It was the sense of secret,\necstatic access. A feeling of control in the largest network on earth. At one point a\nphreaker named John Draper figured out that the little plastic whistles stuffed as\nchildren’s toys inside boxes of sugary Cap’n Crunch cereal produced the 2600 Hz\ntone nearly perfectly. The hack made him a legend. He became known, inevitably, as\n92\nCap’n Crunch. An article about Draper in Esquire in 1972 had, for instance, inspired\ntwo teenagers named Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak to start their first company to\nbuild and sell little phreaking boxes. Woz later recalled nervously meeting the Cap’n\none day in California. He was a strange, slightly smelly, and extremely intense\nnomadic engineer. “I do it for one reason and one reason only,” the Cap’n huffed to\nthe writer of that Esquire article, who was a bit baffled why a grown man would find\nwhistling into phones so appealing. “I'm learning about a system. The phone\ncompany is a System. A computer is a System. Do you understand? If I do what I do,\nit is only to explore a System. Computers. Systems. That's my bag,” he said. “The\nphone company is nothing but a computer.\" 130\nI’d heard about the Amsterdam conference in the 2600 hacking circles, somewhere\nbetween the debates about circuit boards and which company was best for the\nrelatively new service of email. The gathering was organized by group of Dutch\ncomputer geeks who published their own magazine, Hack-Tic. I sent an email to the\nfounders. One of them, a man with the improbably exotic name Rop Gonggrijp, sent\nback an irresistible reply. “On August 4 th , 5 th and 6 th we’re organizing a three-day\nsummer congress for hackers, phone phreaks, programmers, computer haters, data\ntravelers, electro-wizards, networkers, hardware freaks, techno-anarchists,\ncommunications junkies, cyberpunks, system managers, stupid users, paranoid\nandroids, Unix gurus, whizz kids, warez dudes, law enforcement officers\n(appropriate undercover dress required), guerilla heating engineers and other\nassorted bald, long-haired and/or unshaven scum,” the invitation began. Data\ntravelers? Electro-wizards? Warez dudes? I had to go. “Also included,” the note\ncontinued, “are inspiration, transpiration, a shortage of showers (but a lake to swim\nin), good weather (guaranteed by god), campfires and plenty of wide open space\nand fresh air.”\nIn those early days of the Internet, there was only the barest tickle of a commercial\ninstinct at work. If anything, most of the people at places like 2600 or Hack-Tic were\nprofoundly anti-commercial. They were hobbyists, as entranced by role-playing\ngames like Dungeons and Dragons as by their clapped-together, often unreliable\ndigital machines. It was no accident that firms like Apple had emerged from groups\nwith names like The Homebrew Computer Club, names that suggested a rooty, selfdefining\nhippy ethos. Everyone you met in that world fell pretty squarely into one of\nthose weird-by-weirder categories Rop Gonggrijp had listed in his email. Their\nrelaxed, nerdish temperament was reflected in the design of the Internet itself –\nopen, generous, easy to manipulate, emotional at times in debates over protocols,\nfreedom loving. The net design was, as well, a reaction against the systems that\ntroubled all of us most. Like AT&T, say, which was closed, stingy, and tough\n(therefore enjoyable) to manipulate.\nJon Postel, the American engineering and programming genius who had helped\nwrite some of the essential original protocols of the Internet, summed up this point\n130 “The phone company”: Secrets of the Little Blue Box, Ron Rosenbaum, Esquire\nMagazine (October 1971)\n93\nof view in 1980 as an idea that he thought should characterize the architecture of\nthe Internet. “Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept.” 131\nPostel’s idea became known as the “robustness principle” and it was meant to\ndetermine how switches and nodes on the net should behave. They should, Postel\nfelt, be good at handling lots of different types of communications – they should be\n“robust” – but they should also be careful not to spread too much non-standard\ngarbage out into the networks. This was an essential advance over the old ARPANET\nPaul Baran had helped inspire. That system worked wonderfully by itself, in\nisolation, as it sent humming nuclear launch codes zipping around, but it struggled\nwhen it needed to interoperate with other networks. It wasn’t generous. The\nInternet that Postel and others were designing was intended to be much, much\nlarger than ARPANET, so an ability to speak to others and be understood was\nessential. It was like planning an airport: You wanted to be able to land lots of\ndifferent types of planes. But if someone started throw golf balls, jello and gasoline\non the runway you’d have a problem. It would slow down the system for everyone.\nPostel was telling engineers: Be careful what you do and what you put onto the\nsystem. Take responsibility on your end. Build something that’s generous in what it\nwill handle from others.\nBe liberal in what you accept. From the first moments on the grass in Lelystad, the\nsmall town just outside Amsterdam where the Hacking At the End of the Universe\nconference gathered, the mad diversity that this idea suggested was an astonishing,\ndelightful fact. As broad and strange a group as Rop’s email had hinted might come\nwas in fact there, under the trees, happily running cables from tent to RV, powering\ntheir connected routers with gas-fired generators, marveling at data transmission\nspeeds that today, your phone might manage from an underground garage with the\nbarest connectivity. The two-day outdoor festival was an example of human\ninteroperability. Postel’s Principle brought to life. Few of us knew most of the group.\nNearly everyone was, well, not the most social. But there was instant connection,\ndiscussion, board gaming, and a degree of frank interoperating I’d never quite seen\nbefore. It was a harbinger of two decades of digital cross connection yet to come.\nOf all the people at the Hacktic conference, however, among the system managers\nand Unix gurus and heating system guerillas (hey, everyone should have a hobby), it\nwas the Warez Dudes who were of the most interest – both to the participants in the\nconference and to the white vans cruising nearby, allegedly filled with curious Dutch\npolice. The nickname came from the “wares” they had access to, which were largely\ncracked open versions of commercial software that could be shared and distributed\nand manipulated on private bulletin board systems. The Warez Dudes were pirates.\nAnd like most pirates they had an early sense of the very edges of the law and of the\nsmell of money drifting along new and essential routes. If hacker culture was, in\nthose early days, a frontier society – and it was, even down to the sad shortage of\nsingle women – these were the people living on the very furthest edges of the\n131 “Be conservative”: Jon Postel “DOD Standard Transmission Control Protocol”\n(1980) RFC 761, IED 129\n94\nwilderness. They fused often fantastic technical skill with the hacker’s instinct for\ncontrol – admixed with a criminal’s hunger for profit.\nThe first computer viruses and worms were part of what they sold. These had\nappeared in the 1980s, mostly as curious intellectual exercises. There was a desire\namong computer engineers, a scientific sort of craving, to see what might be done on\nthe systems they had built. It was not unlike those whistling telephone tones that\nhad so fascinated Cap’n Crunch and Steve Jobs and Woz. Could you make the big\nroom-sized machines twitch in ways no one had imagined? Absolute, undeniable\nthrill ran through this sort of activity. I can still recall returning to my office one day\nin the mid-1990s with a Ziploc-bag that contained a floppy disk marked “Viruses”\nwhich I used to promptly break my computer so completely it had to be\nreformatted. Twice. Such adventures, however, were also producing some of the\nbest programmers of my generation. Managing tricks inside those early systems\nrequired then, as it does now, a profound intimacy with the code defining their\nelectrical operations. (Computer programs are called “code”; people who write and\ntest them are “coders”.)\nBut the secret moves behind those early cracks and exploits were rarely secret for\nlong. The informal culture of stapled together magazines like 2600 told you what\nyou needed to know about this band: It was a group that liked to share, to brag, to\nindulge each other in stories about systems they had cracked open, to play with a bit\nof light paranoia about who might be watching you and who might care. Computers.\nSystems. That’s my bag. You might as well spread some of the adrenaline rush of\nyour adventure with others. The sense of a “shared alternate reality” most of us had\nfirst experienced in games like Dungeons and Dragons or the pages of Dune fit nicely\ninto the digital world. This open, friendly temperament animated most of the people\nspread across that Amsterdam field, jumping into the lake instead of showers,\ntalking math, buzzing at each other like a fridge. We had the programmer’s raw\nfascination about what a machine might be made to do, even in ways that were\ndeeply unintended. We were harmless. The Warez Dudes, however, were different.\nTheir fascination was a greedy, nasty obsession.\n2.\nThe business of playing with and inside of connected computer systems was, even\nas we sat on that Amsterdam summer lawn, shifting. It was slipping from earnest\nhobbyists and system managers to something a bit more sinister. We had just begun\nusing a new phrase, “malware,” to describe the malicious software that took\nadvantage of Postel’s “be liberal” instinct in order to devastate connected systems\nthat were filled with too many trusting, unlocked doors. It wasn’t merely the relaxed\nsystem design of the early ‘net or computer systems that made exploitation easy. It\nwas also that the networks and machines themselves were slipping with a kind of\nfrictionless momentum towards increasing complexity. This meant, invariably, that\npopular programs often shipped to users with mistakes or programming oversights\nthat invited hijack. The year before the Amsterdam conference, for instance, a cruel\nprogram known as “Michelangelo”, which would overwrite the data on hard disk\n95\ndrives with meaningless ones and zeros, spread onto millions of computers. Once a\nmachine was infected the overwrite command would activate every year on March\n6 th – a twisted celebration of the birthday of the great Renaissance artist. But\nbecause the program operated at the BIOS level – the basic input/output heart of\nthose early machines – it was nearly impossible to eradicate. Computer security\ncompanies, soon to be known as computer “insecurity” companies because they\nwere (and are) constantly behinder, responded with the following rather\nunconvincing advice: Turn your machine off on March 5 th . Turn it back on March\n7 th . 132\nEven the biggest, most powerful companies were shipping programs packed with\npotential problems, cracks that were often baked into the design of a system,\ninvisible even to their makers. A couple of years after the Hac-Tic conference, for\nexample, a popular word processing program included a feature that could permit a\nsurreptitious hacker to make a computer to execute all sorts of nefarious commands\nonce a user had opened a harmless-looking document. This was sort of like shipping\nhundreds of millions of door locks that would pop easily open for criminals who\nknew to ask. Did you use a word processor in the 1990s? Likely your machine faced\nthis danger: You’d open a note from a friend or a memo from your boss and you’d\nthen instantly, unstoppably forfeit control of your computer, even if you didn’t know\nor see or feel the impact for years. That problem was fixed – companies learned to\nissue what became known as “patches” to plug the inadvertent leaks in their\nsystems – but that such a danger existed and could be profitably used was a sign of\na ruthless evolution. There were billions of dollars, even then, at stake.\nAs technology advanced, so did the malware, which was adapting and evolving to\nnew opportunities. Think of how hugely different our experience of machines is\ntoday as opposed to just a few years ago. Hacking has matured as fast – maybe\nfaster. Early attacks were aimed at machines that had, essentially, no defenses.\nPrograms like “Michelangelo” were designed to act much like the viruses of a\ncommon cold or food poisoning. They sickened and then controlled individual\nmachines, devices with no immune systems. Hackers faced a challenge in finding\nways to sneak these digital diseases onto computers, but of course they finally found\nholes. They hid viruses on floppy disks or inside documents or spread-sheets that\nappeared otherwise safe. Intelligence agencies became infamous for passing out\n“free disks” at conferences or littering defense contractor parking lots with infected\nUSB sticks, waiting for some unsuspecting employee to pop them into a computer\nand invisibly activate some bit of carefully installed, hidden malware. Or, in a clever\ncase of “know your target”, sneaking malware into the code of some particularly\nviolent video game, sure to be played by an adrenaline-addled system administrator\nin a fit of afterhours boredom.\n132 Turn it back on: For a discussion of Michaelangelo see entry for virus in\nEncyclopedia of Computer Science 4 th Ed. (Chichester, UK: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. ),\n1839-1841,\n96\nLike so much about our world, rapid, widespread connectivity of the last decade has\nsharpened these dangers. Connection changes the nature of an object; it can make it\nmuch more vulnerable. It can make the harmless dangerous. Generally, once a\nmachine was jacked into a network, all sorts of fresh possibilities for mischief\nflowed right along with the data. The move from a lone PC on your desk to a really\nconnected machine represented the difference between living in a small town and\nwalking the streets of New York City. In one place you’d have few encounters,\nmostly familiar and harmless. In the other, you’d face an endless stream of the\nstrange, the new and the unexpected. This is what life is like every day for your\nphone or your bank or military – a world of ceaseless assault, often from never-seen\nweapons. Robert Morris Sr., a cryptographic and security genius who towered over\nNSA code breaking programs for decades in the last century, compressed his\nlifetime of experience cracking machines into “Three Golden Rules of Computer\nSecurity”: 133\nRule One: Do not own a computer.\nRule Two: Do not power it on.\nRule Three: Do not use it.\nHe could have added a Fourth Rule: Do not connect it to anything.\nOf course, as we look around today, we’re furiously, enthusiastically violating all\nfour of these rules pretty much every moment. In fact, our whole economic and\nsocial dreamscape depends on breaking them. We want the best device, we want it\nalways on, we want to use it all the time. Utility and connection are almost\nsynonyms now. That the Warez Dudes, or their 21 st century brethren, are hungry to\nexploit these systems offers us a chance to understand even more deeply just how\npower works in this network age. Why are they so desperate to get inside? How\nexactly do they do it? We’ve seen so far two important properties of life in the\nnetwork age. First, the way in which network power exists on a sort of new surface\nof connected devices and cores, tied by strong data links that are slowly ripping\npower out of old institutions. Think of my Dad’s role as a doctor or the sharing\neconomy shocks delivered by connected cars and bedrooms and labor, for instance.\nSecond, we’ve seen how networks are complex adaptive systems, where emergent\nfeatures –billion dollar businesses, terror organizations, drones – appear with an\neasy, destructive frequency that is wiping out old leaders and replacing them with\nnew ones that better fit the demands of a connected age. Looking at the network\nworld and seeing that mesh, seeing the emergence of fit new species and the\nimpending extinction of others is the initial, essential part of the Seventh Sense.\nLingering deep inside the systems themselves, there is another lesson, however.\nAnd, not surprisingly, it is most alive in the hackers. “Exploit engineers,” a team led\nby researcher Sergei Bratus has argued, “show you the unintended limits of your\n133 Bob Morris cite to come\n97\nsystem’s functionality.” 134 Hackers, they mean, reveal the dangerous holes of our\nnew world. The bad news is that the worst of them (and often the best of them skill\nwise) did this at times by swiping your data, your money and finally your peace of\nmind. Their fortunes and safety and curiosity – all of these are woven together in\ntheir hot hunger to touch and pull and break the roots of the network. In a world of\nexpanding connection, they are both more powerful and more dangerous than ever.\n3.\nNetworked systems of our age are confronted, constantly, with diverse, dangerous\nchallenges, each informed by that Gordian paradox so familiar to us by now: The\nmore connected we are, the greater the risks. And as bank balances, secret jet\nengine designs, and other priceless digital data are developed and then slipped\nsafely away on connected machines, the rewards for cracking into the systems grow\n– far faster than the (near zero) costs of trying to break in. “It is increasingly\nobvious,” security researchers F.X. Lindner and Sandro Gaycken have said, “that the\nstate of the art in Computer Network Defense is over a decade behind its\ncounterpart in Computer Network Offense. Even intelligence and military\norganizations, considered to be the best positioned to defend their own\ninfrastructures, struggle to keep the constant onslaught of attackers with varying\nmotives, skills and resources at bay.” 135 The long list of failed US government\nsecurity attempts express a strange digital logic: The more essential it is that an\norganization keep a secret, the less it seems able to do so. A decade behind? That is\nthe gap between a flip phone and an iPhone. In the hyperspeed world of technology\nit is like confronting a laser weapon with a hoplite. The losing race slips easily\nenough into Donald Rumsfeld’s aheader-behinder dynamic, the one that haunts the\nparadoxes of national power we face now. Are we killing more terrorists than the\nmadrassas are producing? Rumsfeld wondered. We can ask: Are we plugging more\nmachines with more layers, software and applications than we can protect? Are we\nmaking more bugs than we’re patching? (Yes and yes.) “Attackers are not like\nnatural catastrophes,” Lindner and Gaycken write. “They can analyze their targets.”\nBratus, a math genius who turned to computer science out of curiosity and now\nteaches at Dartmouth, has spent a fair amount of time trying to understand just\nwhat happens when a computer or a network is exploited by a hacker, or “pwned” in\nthe funny idiom of Warez Dudes language. (The phrase means to take control, or to\n“own” a system. The spelling is an artifact of an overenthusiastic video-game death\nmatch gloat, in which one player killed another and in his rush to celebrate typed\nsomething along the lines of “I pwned you!” The mis-typing lives today: The highest\naward in hacking is known as The Pwnie.) Bratus calls the resulting, pwned device a\n134 “Exploit engineers”:Sergei Bratus, et al. “Chapter 13: ‘Weird Machine’ Patterns”\nin C. Blackwell and H. Zhu (eds.), Cyberpatterns, Springer International Publishing\nSwitzerland 2014, p. 13\n135 Even intelligence: Felix “F.X” Lidner and Sandro Gaycken, “Back to Basics:\nBeyond Network Hygiene”, in Best Practices in Computer Network Defense: Incident\nDetection and Response, M.E. Hathaway (Ed.) IOS Press, 2014\n98\n“Weird Machine”: Computers or sensors or network webs silently made to do what\nis not intended. Made weird. Hacking is, after all, a kind of perverse programming. It\ninvolves slipping inside a target machine, and then driving it to do things it wasn’t\nintended to do, by giving it instructions its designers never knew it might receive. 136\nThe process of developing and using computer bugs, Bratus found, is not unlike the\nmost sophisticated software research. Hacker follow careful patterns. The best of\nthem really conceive of whole systems in the way the finest data architects might.\nThey look for particular designs, weaponize their code with a delicate elegance and\naim relentlessly at total control. A normal machine does what you tell it. A weird\nmachine does what someone else commands it to do.\nHow is such a system born? Well, a potential software hole of the sort that produces\na “Weird Machine” might be as simple as a failure to secure computer code after it is\ncompiled – sort of like not locking the door on your house after you leave – or a\nprogramming oversight that means a machine can’t handle unexpected inputs. Take\nthe technique of “fuzzing”, for example, a famously effective way to turn a normal\nmachine into a weird one. The process involves confusing a digital security system\nby throwing unexpected data into normal, apparently safe-looking procedures like\nlogging into a mail system or transferring money by wire. Think of all the\n“username” and “password” forms you see when you’re on the Internet. In a fuzzing\nattack, instead of placing a legitimate user name or email address in a registration\nfield, hackers might add some unexpected characters known to cause a system to\ncough up a confused response. If you type in, joe@user.com!’ instead of\njoe@user.com as the machine expects, the !’ at the end of the address can baffle and\nstall a mis-programmed device. In some cases, that hiccup opens a vulnerability. A\nproficient programmer can then order the dazed computer, for instance, to open a\ndoor to the root of the system. It’s as if you could walk up to the teller at your local\nbank and shout “Xhsuhgnnsh!!” at her when she asks how you are doing – and in her\nconfusion she lets you into the safe. You’ve made a weird machine of your bank.\nSystem designers in later generations have become much more sophisticated in\ntrying to avoid such problems, not least because they’ve so often fingered the\nembarrassing or costly aftermath of these kinds of holes in their own code. “You do\nnot understand how your program really works until it has been exploited,” Bratus\nhas said, a sentiment that hints at the stomach-lurching moment many coders and\ntheir suddenly victimized users have now had. 137 You don’t understand yourself until\nyou’ve been pwned. The odds that the endless possible glitches can ever be\ncompletely patched is honestly zero. Hackers continue to use classic exploits like\n136 It involves: Julian Bangert, Bratus et al. p2 “The Page-Fault Weird Machine:\nLessons in Instruction-less Computing”, Presented as part of the 7th USENIX\nWorkshop on Offensive Technologies, (Washington, D.C., 2013) available on\nwww.usenix.org\n137 “You do not really understand”: Rebecca Shapiro, Sergey Bratus, Sean W.\nSmith, “’Weird Machines’ in ELF: A Spotlight on the Underappreciated Metadata”\npaper delivered 7th USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies, (Washington, D.C.,\n2013) available on www.usenix.org\n99\nfuzzing, back-doors, or rootkits – and to develop new, more intricate ways to steal a\nmachine’s mind. This race for mastery is a sprint, one that heads ever deeper into\nthe depths of a vulnerable system. The closer you are to the very core of a computer\nprogram or a network, the more control you have. Real mastery of the heart of a\nsystem would be like having a spy win the Presidency, turning the whole US\ngovernment into a “Weird Machine”. That prize of immediate, high-level and totally\n“trusted” access remains the Warez Dude gold standard. 138\nThe most dangerous – and therefore the most alluringly valuable – of these sorts of\nattacks, are known as “zero-day” exploits. The danger they represent only becomes\napparent at some awful instant, “Day Zero”, when they are revealed to have been\nrunning wild inside some hapless network or machine. That first moment in the\nknowledge of the bug is like day zero in a cancer diagnosis, and it begins an\nimmediate race to find and deliver a cure. Such completely unknown, secret\nvulnerabilities are fissures in the walls of computers that their manufacturers,\nsystem engineers, and security experts usually don’t realize are there. The dream of\nhackers and spies and greedy Warez Dudes is a version of this trick called an\n“Advanced Persistent Threat” – hidden, back-door access to a machine that endures\neven for years, through upgrades and security checks and system cleanups, all the\nwhile forcing the now-weird computer to do things its user won’t even be aware of:\nSend a copy of every keystroke to another machine, for instance, or serve as a\nrobotic launching pad for attacks on other machines. All while acting like a perfectly\nnormal machine.\nThe best of the zero day exploits are based not on the idea of sneaking malicious\nsoftware onto machines so much as on taking existing, trusted code and finding tiny\nholes that can be blasted into giant, insecure data tunnels. These tools for\nmanipulation are digital opiates, in a sense, for connected nervous systems. Such\nattacks often rely on errors already knit into computer systems, or innocent\nseeming features that can be made dangerous. Every computer and software\ndesigner knows their systems are vulnerable. Mathematicians have proven you can\nnever be absolutely sure a connected machine is safe. A mobile phone, for instance,\ncontains nearly 30 million lines of code. The systems that run massive cloud\ncomputing basins like those at Google or Amazon are even larger, updated every\nday, and have to cope with unprecedented flows of data at very high speeds. Even\nexpert programmers will leave four or five errors in every million lines of code. 139\n138 That prize: Sergey Bratus, Julian Bangert, Alexandar Gabrovsky, Anna Shubina,\nDaniel Bilar, and Michael E.

The\npiece is co-authored by and in honor of Len Sassman, one of the leading thinkers of\nthe Language Security or LangSec movement who died in 2011. Many of his talks,\nstill available online, reflect an unusually powerful mix of philosophical and\n100\nSoftware and hardware manufacturers usually struggle to keep such exploits secret\nuntil they can deliver a fix, but this doesn’t always work. Secrets get out. And,\nanyhow, even once a patch is developed, it can take weeks or months before it’s\nwidely installed. It’s not uncommon, therefore, that within hours of the\nannouncement of a newly found zero day, attacks using that method explode around\nthe net. Thousands of hackers try to take advantage of the vulnerability, to kick at\nthe defensive corners of systems while they are down for repair or restart – or\nsimply left vulnerable by slower-witted system administrators who don’t yet know\nthat it is now open hunting season on a particular bit of code. Heartbleed, a “zero\nday” that permitted hackers to slip into your computer via holes in website and\nbrowser security, was disclosed to the world on April 7, 2014 – more than two years\nafter it had apparently been put in place because of a programming error.\nAccidentally? By an overworked engineer? Deliberately? By some state security\nagency? In any event, two days after it was announced and long before it had been\nfully patched, attacks using the method grew from a few dozen per hour to millions\nas hackers tried to suck data from unsecured networks. 140 The exponential power of\na connected system is as apparent in sickness as in health.\n4.\nIn recent years, hacking has moved deeper still, beyond the level of software and\nUSB drives and into the very atomic level of computers, the places where the\nelectrons that make up bits and bytes float. The technical elegance of these microlevel\nhacks has been, often, breathtaking – exploits that look like Wagnerian operas\ncompared to the Cap’n Crunch’s thin, reedy weird-machine whistle. As companies\nlike Intel and AMD began packing more memory cells on silicon wafers, for example,\nthey noticed magnetic interference flowing across the surface of their chips like\nwaves. Electrical signals, recall, have a magnetic element, so more tiny digital cells,\ncloser together, is like a bowl of interacting magnets. Physics would have predicted\nsuch a result. In 2014 security researchers Mark Seaborn and Thomas Dullien, who\nworked at Google, discovered that they could use the magnetic vibrations on two\nparallel rows of memory chips to flip the electrical state of a third row – sort of like\nusing a magnet under a table to move a paperclip around – in a way that the system\nmight never notice 141 . This permitted them to reach “off limits”, super secure areas\nof the machine’s memory where they could do what they wanted. They called the\nbreak, “Rowhammer” and it represented an ideal and essentially unfixable hole that\naffected nearly every small chipset made for a half a decade. They published the\ntechnical consideration about modern computing systems. See also Rebecca\nShapiro, Sergey Bratus and Sean W. Smith, ““Weird Machines” in ELF: A Spotlight on\nthe Underappreciated Metadata”, paper published online by Bratus.\n140 In any event: Leyla Bilge, Tudor Dumitras, “Before We Knew It: An Empirical\nStudy of Zero-Day Attacks In the Real World,“ Paper presented at ACM CCS ’12, Oct\n16-18, 2012, p 10\n141 In 2014: Mark Seaborn and Thomas Dullien, “Exploiting the DRAM rowhammer\nbug to gain kernel privileges”, March 18. 2015, Google Project Zero blog\n101\nresult immediately as a warning to possibly affected victims, but the exploit\nhummed at such a basic level of the system that it proved impossible to fully patch.\nIt was like trying to patch physics.\nConnection changes the nature of an object. This has a particular impact on the\nsecurity of our systems, and by extension, our own safety. Computer researcher\nNathaniel Husted has described a world of “emergent vulnerabilities” – wormholes\nin software and hardware, communications or finance, that pop up in the connected\nuniverse unbidden and unplanned. “The fundamental aspect of emergent\nvulnerabilities and attacks,” Husted writes, “are that they appear benign until\ncertain criticality conditions are met, at which point they become malignant.” 142\nThese risks we don’t want sit right alongside all the things we do want from\nconnectivity. In fact – and this is Hulsted’s point – they are the things we want from\nconnectivity, perverted into danger.\nPaul Baran would have been impressed to see just how right he was, how\nconnections between us now are like irresistible gravity waves – and how gravity\nalways wins. In 2015, for instance, Israeli security developed an astonishing hack\nthat proved that nearly spiritual claim that all objects were linked by connection–\nand demonstrated the way that slippery, hungry attacks can breach even the safestlooking\narrangements. “It has been assumed that the physical separation of\ncomputers provides a reliable level of security,” Mordechai Guri and his team wrote\nin a paper describing how they had used one isolated machine to infect another.\nPhysical separation is, in fact, one of the cardinal rules of safe computing, a kind of\nlemma to join Robert Morris Sr,’s “don’t connect” rule of network safety: Two\nmachines, unconnected by a network, should not be able to affect each other.\nImagine I put one kid with a flu in one classroom and a schoolmate of his in another\nbuilding. The second kid should remain healthy. The Tel Aviv research team wanted\nto challenge this. They first placed two computers side by side on a desk,\nunconnected to each other by any wire or network. One machine was connected to\nthe Internet. The other was completely isolated – it was “air gapped”, like the\nhealthy kid in the distant building, a sort of digital “boy in the bubble,” in touch with\nonly the air around it. Then, the researchers began their Houdini trick: Look! Watch\nus corrupt this completely unconnected machine! Running a set of programs on the\nnetwork-connected machine, the Israeli team was able to warm the processor board\nof that computer like a revving car engine, eventually making it hot enough that the\ntemperature changes were detected by sensors inside the secure, allegedly\nimpregnable “boy in the bubble” machine sitting nearby. The heat wave triggered a\nfan system inside the clean machine, which in turn activated a piece of pre-installed\nmalware that let the hot machine pwn the bubble machine through temperature\nvariations. In a video demonstration of the exploit, you can watch the infecting\nmachine glow ever hotter, issuing “thermal pings” as it sweats and then infects its\n142 “The fundamental aspect”: Nathaniel Husted “Analysis techniques for exploring\nemergent vulnerabilities and attacks on mobile devices” PhD. Thesis (available\nonline from Indiana University, 2013) p. v\n102\nsafe, “unconnected” neighbor. 143 The heat transfer had a simple message: Nothing is\nsafe.\nWhy put such effort, worthy of the deepest physics problems, into the challenge of\nsneaking into a cellphone undetected? Well, for Seaborn and Dullien, the drive was\npart of a “discover and publish” effort to keep the overall system clean. It is better to\nhack, discover and patch than to be hacked, and remain undiscovered. But these\n“good guy” engineers are racing against different, equivalently sophisticated, lessdecently\ninspired teams. The development and sale of zero-day bugs is, after all, a\nbusiness. Modern versions of Cap’n Crunch whistles crack access to some of the\nmost essential financial, political and security data stores on the planet. As the\npower and value of hacking targets has increased, so has the price of the exploits.\nPublic “zero day markets” sponsored by companies like Google and Microsoft pay\nhundreds of thousands of dollars to researchers who discover holes in their\nsystems. “Better to find them ourselves,” the thinking goes. Though that does not\nalways make the embarrassment less acute when holes are spotted. At one of the\nmost carefully watched public hacking competitions in early 2015, for instance, a\nskinny, smiling South Korean named Jung Hoon Lee took home $225,000 in prize\nmoney by pwning a series of some of the most important, common programs on the\nplanet, Apple’s web browser Safari and Google’s Chrome among them. These\nsystems had been constructed at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. They‘d\nbeen assembled under the gaze of some of the best PhD-led computer scientists in\nthe world. Jung Hoon Lee’s exploits ran through their complete defenses in less than\na minute. 144\nAs good and fast as someone like Lee might be, he’s nothing compared to what the\nbest hackers do. They don’t work in public or compete in hotel ballrooms. They\ndon’t brag. And they develop ideas that make $225,000 look like a bargain. These\nsuccessors to the Warez Dudes work for cybercriminal billionaires, for intelligence\nagencies, and even (often) just for themselves. They help find and deploy the sorts of\nreally deep system exploits that enable brazen cyber thefts of millions of pieces of\npersonal data or attacks like the Stuxnet virus, which caused thousands of Iranian\nnuclear centrifuges to vibrate themselves apart. And they do still more: Most of the\nattacks we’ve talked about so far occur in installed, running boxes. But the\ncompanies that make those boxes oversee a whole, vulnerable process of building\nand testing and designing and installing them. And it’s here, with billion dollar\nbudgets at work, that some exploit teams make and leave vulnerabilities that they\ncan later, ruthlessly exploit. Every step of that gestation – from sneaking secrets into\nearly code bases to intercepting and rewiring routers as they ship overseas – is now\nan opportunity for secret control. Or for unanticipated risk, for “emergent\n143 In a video: For a description of this exploit see Mordechai Guri, Matan Monitz,\nYisroel Mirski, Yuval Elovici, “BitWhisper: Covert Signaling Channel between Air-\nGapped Computers using Thermal Manipulations” (2015) available on\narXiv:1503.07919 [cs.CR]\n144 Jung Hoon Lee’s exploits: “Chrome, Firefox, Explorer, Safari Were All hacked at\nPwn2Own Contest”, PC World via IDG News Service Mar 20, 2015\n103\nmisbehavior” that defies simple analysis. You can’t predict where you might be\nattacked by merely looking at the possible holes in each piece. Rather, it’s the whole\nsystem that breeds risks. It acts in ways that the designer could not have predicted\nin advance. “Clearly the system itself is misbehaving,” the researcher Jeffrey Mogul\nwrites of his study of various cases where networks are cracked in this fashion.\n“However, none of the components have failed per-se.” 145\nThe complexity of the systems themselves has been, not surprisingly, mimicked in\nthe design of hacking attacks. What was once done by a single Warez Dude is now\nhandled with division of labor, technical specialization and intensive pre-attack\nresearch. Every innovation in “righteous malware” is quickly copied and used in\ndangerous attack tools. The clever modular design of Stuxnet, for instance, was\nstudied by criminals and was found years later still echoing in weapons aimed at\nbanks, credit card companies and health insurance firms. “We are not experts in\nmilitary history, doctrine, or philosophy,” cybersecurity researchers Stephen Cobb\nand Andrew Lee have written, “so we are unaware of the correct word for the\nfollowing category of weapons: the ones you deliver to your enemies in re-usable\nform.” Cyberattack systems can be dangerous not least because they boomerang.\nThey are delivered intact, primed for re-use to enemies who may choose to bounce\nthem back at your banks, hospitals and electrical grids. “Righteous malware is\nunique,” Cobb and Lee conclude. “You are giving away your weapons, tactics and\ndesigns simply by using them.” 146\nIt’s not only American services hunting and using such backdoor keys and battering\nrams, of course; not only the NSA that sees its viruses retooled and reused.\nComputer security researchers describe opening up the laptops of unwary business\ntravelers and finding the machines blasted inside by malware and other technical\ncancers, carefully planted by a half-dozen intelligence agencies and criminal\norganizations. It’s like discovering a closet full of spies in your house, each being\ncareful not to step on the other’s toes as they watch and listen to your life. Why is my\ncomputer so slow, a government official in a Eurasian capital might ask. It is because\nit has been simultaneously pwned by Americans, Russians, Israelis, Chinese, and\nmaybe a local Mafioso or two – and their code is not running smoothly.\nA couple of years ago I had a naïve moment when I thought, perhaps, it would be\npossible and in everyone’s interest to go back to those simpler, innocent Hacktic\ndays, when information about vulnerabilities was widely shared and easily\ndiscussed – and holes were quickly patched as a result. I was thinking about the\nproblem of cybertension between the US and China and suggested applying an\n145 “However”: Jeffrey C. Mogul, “Emergent (Mis)behavior vs. Complex Software\nSystems”, HP Labs Research Papers, 2006, HPL-2006-2\n146 “We are not experts”: Stephen Cobb and Andrew Lee, “Malware is Called\nMalicious for a Reason: The Risks of Weaponizing Code” in P.

Stinissen eds., 6 th Annual Conference on Cyber Conflict (NATO\nPublications, 2014) 71-82\n104\nimportant idea of the scientist Dan Geer to the ever more fraught relations. 147\nPerhaps the US and China could work together to buy up and then publish all the\nzero days as they emerged, I thought. 148 Instead of the dangerous code falling into\nthe hands of cybercriminals, Mafiosi and terrorists, the two countries could lead an\neffort to jointly buy any new exploit for five times what anyone else would pay – and\nthen immediately publish what they had bought and the necessary patch. This\nwould make the network safer for everyone. I should have known better.\nThe US and China and other nations were (and are) buying world-class zero days.\nBut they were never going to publish them. They were buying them to use.\nSometimes against each other. Sometimes, unnervingly, against their own citizens.\nAnd they needed to keep on buying and developing and hiding such tools on an\nexhausting, never-ending security treadmill because, unlike traditional weapons,\nwhich could be stockpiled to use whenever they were needed in the future, the holes\nof the most valuable zero-days might be patched at any moment, making a once\ndevastating bit of malware instantly useless. And, as the systems matured and\naccelerated, this meant that they had to run ever faster to keep up. Which further\nreduced their incentive to “buy and publish” what they did have. Little surprise then\nthat all around the IT universe in recent years, the incidence of reporting dangerous\nbugs has been declining, even as we know the number of known security holes is\ncertainly growing. 149\nGrab the five nearest electronic devices near you and you can be pretty sure each is\nvulnerable; which of course means you are vulnerable too. Not merely to the loss of\nyour secrets, but also to perversion and control. This is the cold truth: that old\nhacker ethos, the one spread out so warmly on Amsterdam grass 20 years ago, the\nbe liberal in what you accept frontier society instinct, is dead. Weird machines and\nnormal machines, weird networks and normal ones, people made weird by\ntechnological manipulation and those who have note – they will all, inevitably, live\nside by side. The more essential machines become to our connected lives, the more\navidly weird and hacked the networks will become. The incentive to whistle up\ncontrol of the systems, and control of those of enmeshed in them, is the only thing\nthat seems to grow faster than the system itself.\nThis vulnerability of connected systems is an important mile marker in our route\ntowards understanding some principles of power in a connected age. “Read over\nand over again the campaigns of Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus, Turenne,\nEugene and Frederick,” Napoleon wrote once. “Make them your models. This is the\n5.\n147 I was thinking: Dan Geer, “Cybersecurity as Realpolitik”, speech delivered at\nBlackHat, August 6,2014\n148 Perhaps: Joshua Cooper Ramo “Talking Cyberthreat with China”, International\nHerald Tribune, July 10, 2013\n149 Little surprise: Linder Gayten Back to Basics p. 58\n105\nonly way to become a great general and master the secrets of war.” 150 I sometimes\nfeel the same reading over stories of zero-day attacks, clever hacks like\n“rowhammer” or the Tel Aviv heat hack. You can distill from each tale of a broken,\nonce-secure systems an essential principle: The hackers rush always, relentlessly at\nthe central core of a system. They aim to make it weird, to manipulate it madly from\nthe inside out. Network power doesn’t merely come from that 10 million device-perday\nspread of global connectivity, after all, it also comes from incredible\nconcentration of power inside certain systems we all rely on: Chips, data bases,\ncentralized and gatekept platforms. Control of such hubs and roots of our world can\ninfluence everything; little wonder they are such an appealing target. “The\nconventional belief that all nuclear systems are ‘air gapped’ is a myth,” the Russian\nsecurity researcher Eugene Kaspersky has warned. The result: “There are three\ntypes of people: Scared to death. Opportunists. Don’t care.” 151\nThis sense that the systems are so vulnerable if you can get to their hearts is what\nlures hackers ever deeper, into the code kernels where the most basic instructions\nare decided. That they can often make machines weird by using the device’s own\ncode against them, like some sort of autoimmune disease, is only a marker of the\nparticular perversity of the problem here. Security researchers call such holes\n“vulnerabilities” in a system, but of course they are much more than weak spots.\nThey are potentially fatal. In a way, the hot rush to touch and tickle and maliciously\nuse these already waiting cancers reveals to us the essential Seventh Sense secret of\nthe Warez Dudes: Connection makes an object vulnerable, yes; but it can also reveal\nthe possibility of total control, of the fundamental root mastery of a connected\nsystem. Such a hole, when it is exposed by connection and then corruption, can be\ncomplete in the scope of its damage, devastating. Lord Acton’s famous line that\n“Absolute power corrupts absolutely,” twists in this age to something like “Absolute\naccess corrupts absolutely.” Connection makes total exploitation, total control,\npossible.\nEvery new generation of connected technologies is breeding essential black boxes,\ncomplex (not merely complicated!) containers filled with algorithmic levers and\ncode tools for digital work that can be understood by only a few people, and\nexploited and used effectively – for good or ill – by a still smaller group. “The greater\nthe dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner\nworkings,” one group of radical digital activists has argued in The Critical\nEngineering Manifesto. 152 They mean that as we turn our safety, freedom, and health\nover to a world of devices and their makers, we must know what goes on inside the\nvery heart of such systems. It’s not merely that everything is connected now; it’s\n150 “Read over and over”: Napoleon, “Maxims” from Thomas Raphael Phillip, ed.,\nRoots of Strategy: The 5 Greatest Military Classics of All Time, (Stackpole Books 1985)\np 432\n151 “There are three types:” Eugene Kaspersky Talk at the Press Club in Canberra,\nAustralia (2013)\n152 “The greater the dependence”: “The Critical Engineering Manifesto,” The\nCritical Engineering Working Group, Berlin, October 2011-2014. Available online\n106\nalso that everything is monitored. Remebered. Studied. The Warez Dudes’ drive to\nget ever closer to the core, to perform even that atomic level hacking, tells us\nsomething about just how much power is locked up in those central cores where\nthis information accumulates. The 2600 hz whistle was, it seems, only the first of an\nendless series of battles for control of the roots and trunklines of modern power.\nAll around us today, huge power accumulates to certain irreplaceable cores. We\nknow this is a problem of connected age design: Giant search engines, certain\nalgorithms, database or communications protocols overmaster us because they can\ngather so much data, so fast, and process it with unique fidelity. What makes a city?\nurban scholars often ask. We might wonder: What makes a platform for network\npower? The answer to both questions is the same: Density. 153 If the first cities of\nAztecs or Mesopotamiaman civilization differed from early tribal clusters because of\ntheir density, the same is true for our first platforms of instant connection. Facebook\nis denser than AOL ever was. More people, more data, thicker connections. Future\nplatforms will be denser still. And if cities and density were once sadly\nunanticipated accelerants to plague, poverty and revolution, we should be aware of\nthe risks of our own tight-clustered centers of dense connection. The security of\nthese cores that link us to each other and our essential data – when jacked by\nhackers, by companies, or even by fast algorithms we don’t understand – is\nimportant not merely because of the possibility of total control a breach might\nrepresent, but because they show us the very fact of such totalizing control exists.\nTo infect, surprise, sicken – all this is alluringly possible and dreamable for anyone\nwith a hunger for mastery. Imagine if you knew your government could be switched\ninstantly and invisibly to malice. (Or, to effectiveness!) Or picture a nation of\nconnected citizens wired for flash-started nationalism and hate. Such a possibility\nexists on linked systems. This potential for total, weird control of the cores – and\nthus total control of anyone connected to them – should force us to wonder a bit.\nEvery evil thing beats in those central nodes: The power to manipulate, to master, to\ndestroy even. With such access I can change what you know about the world, how\nyou vote, where your money sits, what you remember, how soon we spot (or don’t)\na slipped knot in your DNA.\n“Just like every drinking binge ends at vodka, so every hacking session ends at\nkernel.org” Thomas Dullien, the mathematician and good-guy hacker who won a\nPwnie in 2015 for lifetime security achievement, observed once 154 . So much power\nin a connected system lies at its root: Kernel.org, for instance, is the reference copy\nfor LINUX computer code that powers most digital machines on earth, sort of like\nthe original DNA of the net. To manipulate Kernel.org would be to reach into the\nvery spine of the Internet. If the aim is control, if it is to find and exploit the most\nfundamental of cracks in the surface of the black boxes, to get even deeper inside,\n153 What makes a city?: Colin McFarlane, “The geographies of urban density:\ntopology, politics and the city.” Progress in Human Geography (2015) p. 2\n154 “Just like every drinking binge”: Halvar Flake/Thomas Dullien, “Why Johnny\nCan’t Tell If He Is Compromised,” speech delievered at Area41 Conference, (Zurich,\nJune 2014)\n107\nthen inevitably kernel.org or it’s equivalent in any system is the ultimate target.\nHackers might start with beer (your phone), a few glasses of wine (your office email\nsystem), but what they really want is full blotto (kernel.org). Such central black\nboxes exist in any linked system and they represent, at once, both the greatest\naccomplishments of our most masterful systems designers and the point at which\nother, as masterful digital machinists direct their most relentless attacks.\nDullien saw something else too as he considered the work of hackers. Comparing\nsystem cracking to drinking wasn’t an accidental, funny aside for him. Hacking was\nalmost a kind of addiction. It became a chase after a bigger and bigger high, which in\ncomputing terms meant a race to compromise as many machines as possible. Rapid\nescalation, a loss of self-control, the need for more and more – all these are the\nhallmarks of the best widespread attacks, which aim to expand the “compromise\nboundary” until every machine has been made sick. This is why stealing source\ncode, the original instructions that lay behind any computer program, are such a\nprize for Warez Dudes. Source code is the DNA of the black box, in a sense, it can be\nused break into other machines to, well, steal still more source code. This looked, to\nDullien, an awful lot like addiction. And it’s not just lone teen hackers looking for a\ndopamine jump who were chasing machines with a blind addicts urgency. It infects\ngovernments too. “Surprising realization (at least for me) after the Snowden leaks,”\nDullien observed. “Hacking is so addictive that entire organizations can become\naddicts and show addict-style behavior.” 155 This was the NSA or GHSQ or who knew\nwhat other intelligence service, for instance, in a feral hunger for more and more\nand eventually all data. And the ultimate high? Imagine if you could crack the CA, the\nCertificate Authority that provides proof that anyone working on a network is\ntrustworthy. CA “trustworthiness guarantees” are keys that permit access to any\ncomputer, phone and network. The whole connected world depends on CAs to know\nif software is safe. To control the CA would be a dream for an addicted organization,\nlike a set of keys to the local pharmacy. No lock would really serve much of a\npurpose. You could touch the beating heart of any machine on earth. The ultimate\nblack box. We should all hope the CA, at least, always remains pristine in this\ndangerous world.\nIt was hacked in the summer of 2011.\n6.\nDullien’s observation that “every hacking binge ends at Kernel.org” touches\nsomething far deeper than just the world of hackers. Sure, that urgent drive to get to\nthe very core of systems is a very specific, unquenchable digital thirst. It’s where the\nmost power is, as we’ve seen. There’s a rush in getting there: When brain\nresearchers found a spike in dopamine levels of university students engaged in\npassword hacking, that was hardly a surprise to anyone who’s ever written or used\n155 ”Surprising realization”: Thomas Dullien, “Offensive Work and Addiction”,\nkeynote presentation delivered at ISACA Nordic Conference (2014)\n108\nan exploit. 156 But the real drive to get inside is about more than an adrenaline rush.\nRemember that network power, the power that we’re trying to figure out how to\nbend and shape for our own security, exists in a kind of dynamic tension. It’s like a\nstretched, taut fabric spread between concentrated cores and billions of connected\nusers or devices. The logic of spreading and distributed power, the force that makes\nthe network bigger, is driven by Baran’s principle of open design, and by our own\nhunger for communications and connection and cool new devices. But there is\nanother side to this tension.\nIn a sense, over the years, a whole set of hot, infectious pressures descended on the\nnetwork of values and friendships and easy cooperation of the Hack-Tic days. “Be\ngenerous in what you receive,” had let the networks of our age grow at an incredible\npace, but at the price of vulnerability, of commercial ambition, and of an eerie\ntechnological lemma that what made the systems faster and stronger might also kill\nthem. A change in culture of the digital elite, naturally, followed. The brutal,\ninarguable, profitable demands of power and politics had cracked apart the unique\nsocial webs of the HacTic era. I did not like watching this sad evolution; none of us\ndid, but anyhow it has produced the world in which our new sensibility will have to\noperate. The openness that we loved and craved in so many areas of life, from our\nminds to our markets, had now become a liability. “I remember what the Internet\nwas like before it was being watched and there had never been anything in the\nhistory of man that is like it,” Edward Snowden once observed, nostalgic for the\ndatascape he saw melt away during his time at the NSA. 157 I realize now that there\nis a whole new generation of young programmers that won’t ever know that original\ngenerous ethos of a place like Hacktic, a fresh cohort of the digital age that operates\nat levels of technical mastery far beyond anything we might have imagined in the\nCiticorp Tower basement 20 years ago. They will confront endless battles to get\ninside and exploit and make “weird” the cores of network power. They will know\nand design and manage instead a world of gates, built for protection. Their instincts\nwill be for opacity and control, not openness and generosity. Invariably this shift\nwill affect the design of the systems this new generation builds which will, in turn,\naffect all of us.\nThe black boxes and the crackers are in a dance, now, a sort of dangerous\nevolutionary waltz that offers a foretaste of what you and I will face as we consider\nthe problems of attack and defense and strategy in a networked age 158 . It reminds\n156 There’s a rush: Wael Khalifa, Kenneth Revett and Abdel-Badeeh Salem “In the\nHacker’s Eye: The Neurophysiology of a Computer Hacker”, in Global Security, Safety\nand Sustainability & e-Democracy Volume 99 of the series Lecture Notes of the\nInstitute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications\nEngineering, (Berlin: Springer), 112-119\n157 “I remember what the Internet was like”: Snowden interview in CITIZENFOUR,\nLaura Poitras (2015)\n158 The black boxes: Nikos Virvilis, Dimitris Gritzalis, Theodoros Apostolopoulos,\n“Trusted Computing vs. Advanced Persistent Threats: Can a defender win this\ngame?” 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence &\n109\nme of an old puzzle of Chinese history: Why were the very strongest dynasties – the\nHan, the Ming, the Tang – always confronted by the best organized, most deadly\nrebels? The answer was rooted in a violent, greedy tango of the development of each\nside. The better a dynasty defended its farmers or its trade or its annual rice harvest,\nthe more the rebels from the steppe had to become strategic and unified and\npowerful. When it was easy to pick off single farmers, then the rebels had no need to\nbe well organized. They could be a bit lazy. Could snatch a year’s undefended\nharvest in an afternoon. But the stronger the empire, the stronger the rebels had to\nbecome 159 . Amsterdam in 1994 was a bunch of lone, weak, unprepared farmers.\nTwenty years later we have a digital empire, and the attackers it deserves are\nappearing, refined and evolved by this same competitive logic. They are better\norganized, smart, intent on getting to the heart of the black boxes of power. And the\nmore we defend against them? The better they will become.\nThat our most essential systems are vulnerable to loss of control is a chilly feeling. It\nis a reminder of the power of the people who know how to crash and manipulate –\nor build and operate – parts of our world most of us barely understand. It’s like\ndiscovering someone could take over your lungs or your heart. We don’t understand\nthose devices either, most of us. But we depend on them entirely. Some of these\nhackers are moved to mischief by technical beauty. Some by the giddy smashing\nrush of breaking in, of touching the core. Others by greed or patriotism or by secret,\nzealous, unlawful obsessions. What the technically best of this group share,\nhowever, is a pressing desire to get as close as possible to the kernels where\ninarguable and even invisible code decisions are made, where digital DNA is printed\nin a sense, and where a total mastery of the binary guts of the system is possible.\nThat Cap’n Crunch thrill, the dream of whistling up control over the thick, helpless\ntrunk of a network, that remains the dream. Remember Conway’s Law: The design\nand activity and control of a network redounds on, even determines the real world.\nIf the whole network is, in a sense, filled with holes, if it contains inherently the\npossibility of being turned into a “weird machine” – what does that mean for the real\nworld?\nThe Seventh Sense insight of this chapter, the key feeling, is that all the systems we\nrely on, that we think we control – financial or political or digital – can all be made\nweird and pwned by forces we cannot see and struggle to stop. Our markets, our\nelections, our knowledge – all of these, dependent on linked systems themselves,\ncan become weird. We can no longer regard them as certain and harmless. The\nhacker’s drive to get to the kernels is not merely an information technology\nproblem. It’s a larger statement about networks, about the way that power and\ndanger are still and always one and the same. The desire to hack the cores of our\nworld is a marker of just how profoundly, even secretly influential the kernels have\nbecome – in ways we’re just now beginning to understand. Bratus was right, that we\ndon’t really understand any system until it’s been exploited, pwned. This is as true\nComputing and 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Autonomic & Trusted\nComputing\n159 But the stronger the empire: See Turchin, p. 3\n110\nfor our minds as it is for our markets. The Seventh Sense feeds a bit on the trail of\nhackers; it is a way to tune our protective instincts. The cracks they find and use do\ntell us an awful lot. But not everything. For that we need to look beyond the people\nattacking. What we really need is a feel for the temprament of the fresh group of\ninnovators and investors and technologists who run and own the dark cores of\npower now – and who, before long, may also run and pwn each of us as a result.\n111\nChapter Seven:\nThe New Caste\nIn which we meet a powerful group defined, enabled and enriched by their mastery of\nthe Seventh Sense.\n1.\nLooking back over several hundred years of European history, the Oxford professor\nDavid Priestland found that the movement of power might be scored by reviewing\nthe alliances and hatreds and hopes of three distinct, interacting groups. He called\nthem “castes”: merchants, soldiers and sages. By merchants, Priestland meant the\nbankers, traders and industrialists whose capital, goods and political power bent\nEurope’s once-feudal economy into something modern and industrial. 160 The Medici,\nDutch coffee traders, Scottish cotton barons. By sages, he had in mind the\nchurchmen and later the technocrats of various empires, the men who helped birth\nand then manage the problems of an Enlightened, urban social order: Locke,\nBismarck, Disraeli. And by soldiers he had in mind both the great aristocratic\nwarrior classes of Europe and upstart, genius figures like Napoleon or Wellington –\nmen who handled martial force with the fresh, surpasssing brilliance of a paintbrush\nor chisel, not an instrument of mass murder.\nThe aligned, shifting interests of these three castes, Priestland wrote, were like\ngears of sorts, each offering special leverage, meshing together to drive nations to\ngreat power. Mix the influence of France’s sage-bureaucrats with her artful soldiers\nand you get the French Imperial period. Marry the interests of Britain’s shrewd 17 th\nCentury trading bankers with her martially inclined sailors and globe-spanning\nVictorian dominance results. Today, of course, the merchants and soldiers and sages\nof our era are also at work. They sit in sovereign wealth funds, wired situation\nrooms and madrasas, churches and research labs. The force of America’s merchants\nand financiers, bolstered by Washington’s security caste, defines much of American\npower. No other nation could, at the moment, comprehensively replace what the\ncountry does with such breadth, intensity and speed. And now, all around the globe,\nwe’re seeing the emergence of what we might think of as a New Caste joining the\nmerchants, soldiers and sages. This is the infotech caste.\nWhat was going on in that field in Amsterdam back in the summer of 1993 was\nnothing less than the birth of the first figures of a connected technological era, of a\nnew elite. This caste I have in mind is defined by their personal proximity and\nfingertip feel for the linked machines that drive so much of our world. They\nrepresent a tiny fraction of our population, but operate with non-linear, massive\nlevels of influence. This New Caste clusters, in ever tighter circles of intimacy,\naround the systems and networks we depend on. They are building new connected\n160 Looking back: David Priestland, Merchant, Soldier, Sage: A New History of Power,\n(New York: Penguin, 2013)\n112\nfinancial systems. Fresh AI designs. Protocols and platforms for secure\ncommunication. Maybe one million people can write object-oriented code at a high\nlevel. A hundred thousand of them can shape that code into some sort of innovative\ndata structure. A few thousand might be able to use it to access and manage a large\ndata center. But get down to the couple of dozen who know how Google or Intel or\nbitcoin really work, the group who can make machines seem to think, who know\nand use backdoors at that atomic level of hacking – well, then you have a tight,\npowerful elite. They are called system designers, algorithmic traders, growth\nhackers or any of a dozen hazy and somewhat unnamable lines of work that fuse\nnetwork mastery with economic, political or social power. If connection changes the\nnature of an object it also elevates, to a level of rare power and influence, those who\ncontrol that connection.\nThrough the networks and black boxes they control, the group of transcendent\ntalents working on search algorithms, data management and machine learning\ntouch, at any one instant, more parts of our lives than any group of elites ever has.\nThat many of them are billionaires as a result should hardly be a surprise. This is a\ncaste marked by constant one upsmanship, by endless and compulsive innovation,\nby a cold and ceaseless fear of obsolescence. They are marked, of course, by a full\nexpression of the Seventh Sense. Their every instinct for starting, financing, growing\nand using new firms or technologies or data-spinning biological tools reflects\ncomplete confidence in network power. If the leading figures of the Enlightenment\nshared a certainty near to faith that reason would unlock nearly any puzzle of mind\nor politics, the New Caste shares a certainty too, that connection can produce a new,\nbetter order. This caste battles with each other. They struggle for dominance over\nmarkets and – more profoundly – for control of the lucrative systems they have\nbuilt.\nMy point in this chapter is simple. It is to introduce this new and powerful caste and\nsee what their successes and failures might tell us about the world we now all share.\nEven now, however, I think we can make this sobering judgment: Whatever nation\ncultivates and trains legions of this New Caste best will rule the future. Think of the\nlegendary Xerox PARC research lab, which in the 1970s produced not just some of\nthe best early members of the New Caste – like Alan Kay or John Seeley Brown– but\nalso a series of fundamental inventions that generated trillions of dollars of value 161 .\nThe mouse. Laser printing. A graphical user interface. PARC was arguably the most\neconomically significant small group in human history, an entire Renaissance\npacked into a couple of dozen offices. Just as the nations that produced the finest\nmariners once dominated global commerce and decided political questions, so\ncountries (or really any group – even terrorists or criminals or bankers) that can\nbreed, train and equip and deploy members of this New Caste will possess a really\nunusual power. Calling them a “caste” is not accidental: There’s a way in which we\nare all now tied to the virtual spaces they control, much as serfs were once bound to\nthe land by feudal lords. The Italian historian Giambattista Vico, in developing his\n161 Think of the legendary Xerox PARC: Chunka Mui, “The Lesson that Market\nLeaders are Failing to Learn from Xerox PARC”; Forbes Leadership Blog / Alan Kay\n113\nnew, scientific view of history in the 18 th Century, once observed approvingly, “The\nEgyptians reduced all preceding world time to three ages, namely, the age of the\ngods, the age of the heroes and the age of men,” he wrote. “During these three ages,\nthree languages had been spoken….Namely the hieroglyphic language, the symbolic\nlanguage and the vulgar language of men.” 162 It’s hard not to feel the new age now\narrives with its own baffling and incomprehensible modes of communication. A\nwhole freshly demanded language.\nIn all of human history only a few languages ever evolve to become honestly global\nin reach and influence – English now, French in the European centuries or Chinese\nin the Asian imperial era. But why English? Why not more decades of French?\nGerman? “Why a language becomes a global language has little to do with the\nnumber of people who speak it,” the British linguist and historian David Crystal has\nwritten. “It is much more to do with who those speakers are.” What made Latin a\nglobal influential language wasn’t that millions of people spoke it, rather it was who\ndid: The elites at the very peak of 1,000 years of European power. What Latin had, in\na sense, was the ears and tongues of some of history’s most influential men. 163 The\nprivate, technical language that connects the New Caste to their machines, to each\nother and to us is one of the sources of their power. Their code marks, like a trail,\nthe path to the cores of a vast and modern power apparatus.\nYou could, if you wanted, compare the New Caste a bit to an earlier generation of\nempire-deciding figures: Ocean explorers. Columbus, de Gama, Magellan. Backed by\na primitive version of venture capital, the “risk finance” of trading houses, these\ndiscovery captains had a hunger to test their certain masteries – navigation, sailing,\ntrade – against the uncertanties of geography, weather and luck. There was as much\nsheer nerve in these adventures as there was real knowledge. What lay five weeks’\nsailing time away from Cadiz? If you were willing to endure the difficulties, to\nbelieve in what might be out there – and your own ability to handle it – then fortune\nawaited. “Early intercontinental travelers not infrequently had to pay for access to\ndistant shores by enduring bitter asceticism,” the German philosopher Peter\nSloterdijk has written. 164 Months at sea, risks of ocean turmoil, starvation, endless\nboredom – all these sacrifices marked sailing adventure. But they knew the rewards\nfor a real mastery of the sea: Fame, riches, knowledge, adventure. Sloterdijk cites\nGoethe, who reflecting on the power of nautical life in 1787, defined the edgy\nadvantage of that ocean-mapping caste in his age: They had perspective. “No one\nwho has never seen himself surrounded on all sides by nothing but sea,” he wrote,\n“can have a true conception of the world and his own relation to it.”\n162 “The Egyptians”: Giambattista Vico, The New Science, (Cornell Press, 1948) 69\n163 What Latin had: David Crystal, English as a Global Language. (2nd ed.\nCambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 7 also Shahar Ronen, Bruno\nGonçalves, Kevin Z. Hu, Alessandro Vespignani, Steven Pinker, and César A. Hidalgo.\n2014. “Links That Speak: The Global Language Network and Its Association with\nGlobal Fame.” Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111 (52) (December 15): E5616–E5622\n164 “Early intercontinental travelers”: Peter Sloterdijk, In The World of Interior\nCapital, Polity 2013, Ch. 13\n114\nWe might say the same about our New Caste, of their sense of the massive datascape\non which we all sail and operate. They too head off to test their skills at coding,\nencryption, system design. They are almost all auto-didact – self taught as\nprogrammers or hackers or AI designers or investors. There is no established path\nto power for them, no route that has been marked before. No wonder the greatest\nfigures of the era are college dropouts. This is a group that looks largely ahead:\nTheir work demands constant upgrade. Every device is shipped imperfect. It’s not to\nsay they are completely denuded of the Sixth Sense. That their feeling for history has\nbeen stripped. But if to be honestly in love with version 1.0 of your product and then\nto shred it for version 2,0 does demand a certain ahistoric distance. The New Caste\nexplorers have a hunger for fresh worlds and landscapes. To get there they endure\nprivations of long isolation – not so extreme as a long ship journey – but they\nburrow deeper and deeper into systems, construct new links and new gates, in\nclosed rooms. “When building machine learning systems, making good decisions is a\nstrategic skill,” the computer scientist Andrew Ng has said. “Every day you wake up\nand you are in some totally unique situation that no one in the planet has been in\nbefore. It’s not a fact, there’s no procedure.” 165\nThis is our world now. No fact, yet. No procedure. A totally unique situation that\ndemands a fresh instinct. We can follow Goethe into our own age: No one who has\nnot seen and felt himself surrounded on all sides by networks can honestly\nunderstand. If that motto of the last great epochal shift was Dare to Know, it was\ncertainly enacted by the sea captains. Discovery and risk were nothing but a nervy\nkind of scientific experiment, where the laboratory was the Earth’s surface and the\ntools of calculation were ships. And in our age? If we’re right that our historic\nmandate is Dare to Connect, well the New Caste is certainly doing that, furiously.\nThey are working away at much that is hidden in our world, just like those old\nexplorers. The billions of phones or sensors or AI-rooted sensor engines spilling out\naround our world are stripping away layer after layer of opacity. Pictures of far\naway places, traffic lessons learned from movement patterns recorded by GPSenabled\nphones, medical treatments refined by constant measurement – these are\nall knotted, one after another, into the fishnet.\nIf the ocean voyages of that older explorer caste mapped our world, the voyages of\nthe New Caste are as much inward as out. They move inside the world of connected\nsystems. Remember: Network power is defined by dynamic tension – the pull\nbetween center and periphery. The same dynamism is at work with the New Caste.\nWhile they are, firmly, in the business of going out and opening our eyes to the\nworld with wider, faster connection, they are also draping huge, essential parts of\nour lives with an impenetrable fustian: The essential algorithms of search engines,\nthe code of machine learning tools, the design of micro-targetted political influence\ncampaign. The sources of New Caste power are wrapped inside layers of complex\ncomputer code, machine learning and data security protocols that few people can\n165 “When building”: Andrew Ng, speech at GPU Technology Conference (March,\n2015)\n115\ncompletely understand. The French philosopher Bruno Latour, the father of “Actor\nNetwork Theory” has called this process “Black Boxing”. The better your phone\nworks, the less you notice it. The more precisely some machine feeds you your news,\nthe less you wonder what might I be missing? “Scientific and technical work,” he\nsays, “is made invisible by its own success.” 166\nThe operating system and network protocols of your tablet device are opaque to you\nnow in a way they never would have been two decades ago (when even the casual\nuser computer had to type to a C: prompt or wildly rage at a crashed “Blue Screen of\nDeath” from time to time). But, in fact, the system is incalculably more complex.\n“Each of the parts inside a black box,” Latour remind us, “is a black box full of parts.”\nAnd it is in the winding and linking of all these pieces that action in a connected\nworld is made possible. “It is by mistake or unfairness that our headlines read ‘Man\nFlies’”, Latour says. “B-52s do not fly,” he writes. “The US Air Force flies.” Every\nplane that ever makes it into the air does so because of the clicking coordination of\nthousands of linked, black boxed systems. Your stock portfolio or your computer or\nyour bio-sensored heart is not a lone object; it’s a feature of a connected landscape.\nWe’re surrounded now, connected to, essential black boxes we’ve no way of\nunderstanding and whose development and operation we’ve left to the New Caste.\nLook around you, how many screens do you see? Each is a billboard: New Caste at\nWork. It’s not only the hardware in our lives that I mean, but the bits of knitted\nprogramming that decide how we search, when we communicate, and if we can\nexchange information or money. The virtual and the real are in constant contact and\nit’s the New Caste that does the stapling. In fact, one of the magic tricks of power in\nthe connected age is an ability to flop easily back and forth between network and\nreality. It suggests other dangers too. As legendary machine systems designer Leslie\nLamport warns: Computer scientists collectively suffer from the confusion of language\nwith reality. 167 Anyone who’s ever written a computer program knows this sense:\nYou write some code. You compile and run the program to see what happens. You go\nback and work on the code some more to refine what you’ve done. You run it again.\nYou touch the virtual; the real reacts. This seems in a way like the most trivial thing,\nthe writing of a computer program or an AI bot or a trading order, but in fact\n166 The French philosopher: Bruno Latour, “On Technical Mediation – Philosophy,\nSociology, Geneaology” in Common Knowledge, Fall 1994 Vol 3 No 2. p. 23\n167 It suggests other dangers: Leslie Lamport, “Computer Science and State\nMachines”, Contribution to a Festschrift honoring Willem-Paul de Roever on his\nretirement” (Redmond: Microsoft Research, 2008). In its entirety it runs: “Computer\nscientists collectively suffer from what I call the Whorfian syndrome—the confusion\nof language with reality. Since these devices are described in different languages,\nthey must all be different. In fact, they are all naturally described as state machines.”\nThe Whorfian problem is a linguistics observation about the way in which our\nthinking is limited by whatever language we have to describe what we see or\ncontemplate.\n116\nsomething incredible is underway in this easy movement from machine to reality. 168\nThe New Caste takes these moves, this easy slip from their keyboards and programs\nto our lives, for granted. They adjust code and networks and formulas; they watch\nthe effects on us. They do it again. The idea that such a move is natural, comfortable\neven, reveals a new and important temprament. It draws a line betweent the people\nwriting the code and those who are snapped about in the world they are coding.\nDo you know who decided what you see when you search? Do you understand what\nthe data on your phone reveals about you? Who will snip at and work on your DNA?\nYour children? Are you trading stocks against some invisible high-velocity\nconnected master who will always be one profitable nanosecond ahead of you? In\nthis sense, network power involves something very much like the intentional\ncreation of concealment. Your Internet search results, for instance, contain a sharp\ntension. Yes, data from all over the planet, from all of history sits rather amazingly in\nfront of you. But that bit of computer code deciding what you see is engaged in a\nkind of digital book burning: It’s making whole sections of knowledge invisible even\nas it is unearthing an ever more precise answer for whatever question you have.\nWhat don’t you see? – is a question that hints not only at what is left out of your\nsearch horizon, but generally at the way in which connected systems establish\nnecessary gates. Part of a Seventh Sense, then, is the ability not merely to look at the\nvirtual world and know how it becomes insidiously real, but also to feel that all the\nconnected points of the real world – markets, weapons, social movements – must be\npulled upon by code and links and networks. “Any technology depended upon,” as\nThe Critical Engineering Manifesto, says is “both a challenge and a threat.” 169 Human\nexperience is, we know, unboxable, uncontainable – our joy, hopes, sense of\nfreedom, these all defy boxing. Yet here, all around us, are containers that affect our\nevery choice. Who knows what happens inside all the difficult boxes?\nThe creeping, essential opacity of power now reveals a twisted puzzle, a really fresh\naspect of this New Caste and the revolution they are making: As much as they are in\nthe business of making knowledge widely and instantly available, they are also\nmadly black boxing our world. This breeds a sly, unintended (I think) tension with\nKant’s Enlightenment admonition to “Dare to Know.” Would you like to Dare to know\nwhy your computer is secure? How your genetic information will be studied and\nused? How encryption works? Mostly the answer to is: You can’t know. It’s too\ncomplex – and, anyhow, if we told you it would make the whole system less secure.\nThere is nothing disingenuous here: You likely wouldn’t understand. It is too\ncomplex. You’d be lost at the first turn into strange technical language, where simple\nwords like “object” or “edge” have specific, essential, different meanings. And telling\nyou would, in fact, expose you and everyone else to all sorts of risks. It’s as if we’ve\nreturned to that famous debate of millennia past, the one lingering between Athens\nand Jerusalem: Could the world be known and atomized and understood as the\nGreeks would have it? Or was mystery, inscrutability and opacity the nature of truth,\n168 This seems in a way: See, for instance, Bret Victor in his speech, “Inventing on\nPrinciple” at CUSEC 2012 Turing Complete Conference available online.\n169 “ Any technology depended upon”:The Critical Engineering Manifesto, as above.\n117\napprehensible, the Rabbis said, only by its movements. Are we back at the first\nchapter of Genesis and its absolute prohibition against eating from the tree of\nknowledge. Or, from the Talmud, “For him who reflects about four things – what is\nabove, what is below, what is before and what is behind – it would be better not to\nhave come into the world.” 170 We want to reflect about what goes on inside the\nmachines. Can we? Should we? How does Dare to know face off against these\nimpenetrable systems.\nIt is little surprise that places like Silicon Valley often leave a visitor with the feeling\nof a town where work is done in rooms within rooms within rooms. To drive along\nthe dulled, anodyne asphalt stretch of road that runs in front of Sand Hill Road in\nMenlo Park almost hurts your head: Inside the offices on revolutions are dreamed,\ndebated and funded. And it looks, for the most part, like a row of mildly prosperous\ndental practices. The real import of the work is, on the outside at least, nearly totally\nmuted. The corporate structure of the most powerful tech companies are padded\nwith this sort of deadening fustian too. Founders control the majority of voting\nstock; shareholders are more like lucky “users” than owners. Control, security and\nspeed in decision-making are secured from the inside, free of exploit risk or\ninterference. The companies are like computers. Of course the founders know where\nreal powers sits. But this shouldn’t distract us from the human energy breathing in\nthe code itself. The programs are “permeated by all the forms of contestation,\nfeeling, identification, intensity, contextualization and decontextualization,\nsignification, power relations, imaginings and embodiments that comprise any\ncultural object,” the computer science historian Adrian Mackenzie has written. 171\nEach of the parts of a black box is a black box. The famous billionaires of our\ntechnology age operate for the most part as their systems do. Their tight, wellengineered\nclusters of machines produce fortunes from connectivity, even as they\nobscure some of the deeper nature of the connections that are essential to their\nsuccess. They are themselves at times obscured, human black boxes in a sense.\n“Linux is just an enabler,” the genius programmer Linus Torvalds once observed\nabout the code language that undergirds much of the connected world. “It’s a solid\nbase, but like all good, solid bases, it really is something that should be almost\nentirely hidden and out of people’s minds.” 172 It is a hard paradox for us. The work\nof the black boxes, of connected systems or protocols such Linux is miraculous. It is\nwonderful in so many ways. And the roots of it are, and seem like they have to be,\nobscure. But this cuts very fast into the arteries of a healthy democracy.\n“Democracy,” Arthur Schlesinger wrote in his famous post-war book The Vital\nCenter, “has no defense-in-depth against the neuroses of industrialism.” It’s easy to\nsee how the system might also have a weakened immunity to the subversive forces\n170 Or from the Talmud: See Leo Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing,\n(Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, 1952), 21\n171 The programs: Adrian Mackenzie, Cutting code: Software and sociality, (New\nYork: Peter Lang 2006) 5\n172 “Linux”: Andy Meek, “Linux creator explains why a truly secure computing\nplatform will never exist” on bgr.com Sep. 25, 2015\n118\nof network power: Contagions of fear, manipulation of data, the subtle and invisible\ninfluence of the boxes we depend upon but don’t understand. 173 Recall Francis\nBacon’s Enlightenment line? That human knowledge is human power? Well, what is\ncomputer knowledge? It is human power? Or something else, in its entire, hidden\nimmensity? You have to wonder if this packing of insight and vision and control into\nblack boxes, or the hands of a small New Caste will bleed us of our liberty as a result.\n“Our constitution is called a democracy because the power to make decisions is not\nin the hands of a minority but of the whole people,” Pericles reminded Athens in his\nFuneral Oration 2500 years ago. “We regard a man who takes no interest in politics\nnot as harmless, but as useless.” 174 Vital engagement is the food of democratic life.\nTo be baffled to the outside of the essential boxes of power then, seems an instant\nsort of cancer on liberty. What do we make of a man who takes no interest in the\nnetworks of networks that control the power to make decisions?\nPerhaps you’ve heard of the famous manufacturing trilema: You can get something\nmade any two of good, fast and cheap. If you want that custom table made quickly\nand well, it won’t be cheap. If you want it good and cheap, you had best be prepared\nto wait. In networks a similar puzzle emerges in my mind. Systems can be any two of\nfast, open or secure. A computer system that is really secure can be open, but it will\nbe very slow, inspecting each packet and instruction like a bank security guard\nwatching customers in a bad neighborhood. Think of the like an airport. Want it to\nbe fast? Secure too? Then it won’t be very fast. Mostly what we want today are fast,\nsecure arrangements for our markets, our nations, our data. So these will become, I\nthink, ever less open.\nIt used to be that history was made in public: Big visible wars and social shifts and\nrevolutions. Pericles in the Athenian square; the churning protests of Jefferson’s\nParis or the massing of armies. Now, however, subtle manipulations of technology,\ninvisible to most of us and maybe even accidental, maybe weird, will produce\nhistoric-scale external effects. Changes to the network design will become political\nand social exploits in a sense, living versions of that atomic-level “rowhammer” hack\nthat work on the connective energy of our world. Already social network analysis\ncan be used to manipulate voting patterns. Soon, it will be possibly to precisely\ntarget any potential voter with a message engineered like a custom-made drug,\ndesigned to bind right to the DNA of your habits and beliefs. It represents the\npossibility for the complete technical perversion of politics.\nAs the New Caste operates on the systems that are at the core of connected politics\nand economics, on how we vote or think or shop, they will vibrate the system in\ninvisible ways even when they don't mean to be nefarious. Improvements may be as\ndangerously unpredictable as bugs. Small changes to algorithms or links or\nprotocols mean our whole system may be pwned before we’re quite aware. Such\n173 “Democracy”: Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Vital Center: The Politics of Freedom\n(Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1949), 246\n174 “Our constitution”: Thucydides, A History of the Peloponnesian War, (Oxford:\nOxford University Clarendon Press, 1881),119\n119\nadjustments will be started and managed and mined for fortunes, of course. The\nSeventh Sense feels the way in which power has shifted, is shifting, from public to\nprivate in this way, masked by coded language, hardware design, corporate\nstructure and the demands for speed and safety we all agree on. Huge shifts in\npower will occur before we are even aware if we don’t have a sensibility to feel them\nout before they occur. Decisions about code, search, machine intelligence, DNA\nalteration rules in labs – all occurring in black box machines or corporations or\ngovernments. Several years ago it occurred to me in an unsettling flash: “The most\nimportant things that will happen in my life will happen in secret.”\nI’m not sure I’ve quite recovered from this insight yet.\n2.\nThis same unnerving worry has troubled many people who think about connected\nmachines, and for some time. It’s not only those among us who are pointlessly\nnostalgic for a different era of devices, when the default setting of our instincts was\nopen, who now worry about this strange tension between function and opacity. And\nremember – I’m running through all this here so we can all understand how to really\ngrab and use this new source of power in the service of what we desire, and to\nprotect the things we care about. But: What are we to make of systems that work\nbetter when they are obscured from us? That we could never understand even if we\ncould see inside? Documents such as The Critical Engineering Manifesto, pulled\ntogether by a collection of uneasy designers and engineers, reflect anxieties that stir\neven inside the hearts of many in the New Caste. “The Critical Engineer considers\nengineering to be the most transformative language of our time,” the Manifesto\nbegins. “Each work of engineering engineers its user, proportional to that user’s\ndependency on it.” That is Conway’s or Wittfogel’s unsettling truth. The technical\nlayout of a social network, a medical diagnostic tool or a financial market affects\nhow we or our markets or our government (or our enemies) behave. We are, in a\nsense, being engineered by the damn opaque systems we are using.\nIn 1965 the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum found himself, somewhat\nunexpectedly, considering this same problem. 175 Weizenbaum had written a\nprimitive computer program to perform what is now known as natural language\nprocessing, essentially a bit of code designed to translate what a user tells a\ncomputer into clear instructions. This is the work that converts your request to a\nmachine for weather updates into a query that can be turned into an answer.\nTeaching a computer to answer a question such as “it is it raining?” demands layers\nof logic and calculation.\nIn 1965, long before our era of simply talking to our phones or computers,\nWeizenbaum’s program was a revolutionary breakthrough. So after developing his\nalgorithms, he wanted to find an intuitive demonstration. He decided to build a\n175 In 1965: Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason, W.H.\nFreeman and Company, 1976 p. 7\n120\nsystem that could, in a very limited sense, converse. The computer would take typed\ninput from a user and then, based on what it understood, ask a question back to\ncontinue the conversation. The approach was borrowed from the psychological\ntheories of Carl Rogers, an American therapist who believed the best way to talk to\npatients was with open ended, careful questions. Weizenbaum developed two\nprograms. The first was called DOCTOR, a script that determined what the computer\nmight say. The natural language processor responsible for carrying on the human\nside of the conversation he called ELIZA, after the heroine from Pygmalion, a poor\ncockney girl who is trained by a phonetics professor to pass as a duchess.\nHere is a discussion between ELIZA and a user that Weizenbaum recorded in 1965:\nPatient: “Men are all alike.”\nELIZA: “IN WHAT WAY?”\nPatient: “They’re always bugging us about something or other.”\nELIZA: “CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE?”\nPatient: “Well, my boyfriend made me come here.”\nELIZA: “YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?”\nPatient: “He says I am depressed most of the time.”\nELIZA: “I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED.”\nPatient: “It’s true, I’m depressed most of the time.”\nELIZA: “DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU TO NOT BE UNHAPPY?”\nPatient: “I need some help, that much seems certain.”\nWeizenbaum’s program quickly became famous around MIT. (The joke was that it\nwas a better conversationalist than most of the awkward shoegazers studying at the\nCambridge campus.) ELIZA gave users a chance to have a taste of a machine with\nsomething like a mind of its own. The program spread to other campuses, to\ndifferent research institutions, and with every step of its success, Weizenbaum\nfound himself more distressed. He summarized his worries in his 1972 masterpiece\nComputer Science and Human Reason. What troubled him was not ELIZA, but her\nusers, the humans. Even when they were professional psychologists, many of them\nquickly considered it reasonable to think that one day the work of diagnosis and\ncounseling might be turned over to machines. This felt like a natural next step in the\nceaseless progress they were used to in their lives. Better refrigerators, stronger\nseat belts, faster jet planes, more plastic – why not a computer doing therapy? It\n121\nsounded kind of wonderful. “A number of practicing psychiatrists seriously believed\nthe DOCTOR computer program could grow into a nearly completely automatic form\nof therapy,” Weizenbaum wrote. “I had thought it essential, as a prerequisite to the\nvery possibility that one person might help another cope with his emotional\nproblems, that the helper himself participate in the other’s experience.” To use a\nmachine for such a task? He was horrified. Weizenbaum knew the empathy ELIZA\nwas exuding was faked. It was just code. “Science,” he concluded, “has been gradually\nconverted into a slow-acting poison.”\n“Would you mind leaving the room,” Weizenbaum’s secretary said to him once, lost\nin a particularly personal discussion with ELIZA. “The reaction,” he wrote, “showed\nme more clearly than anything I had seen hitherto the enormously exaggerated\nattributions even a well-educated audience is capable of making, even strives to\nmake, to a technology it does not understand.” This was black boxing at its worst: “I\nhave no idea how this thing works. And it’s wonderful!”\nWhat makes the New Caste so particularly powerful is that their essential work is to\nbuild and operate the cores that control these systems. And the more people they\nlure onto them, the more powerful the platforms – and the people who run them –\nbecome. “The computer programmer,” Weizenbaum wrote, summing up his lessons\nfrom ELIZA, “is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver.” Each of\nthese cores represents a fusion of power and politics and technology like nothing\nthe world has ever seen. They are assembled mostly from scratch, they represent\nthe concentration of billions of connections, and their direction is determined by\ntechnological and market factors as much as by any democratic twitch.\nThe strategic power of societies that train the best of the New Caste is probably selfevident\nby now. To educate and deploy masses of people capable of such\ntranscendent design genius will mark a difference, an electric gating line between\nthe nations that succeed and those that fail. But such training brings a real tension, if\nthis group is allowed to really rip away at their work. What won’t they attack?\nControl over the protocols that answer questions, move money, protect data,\nanalyze your DNA – it’s hard to think of any single locus of power that will ever be\ngreater than the tight, gravitationally inevitable platforms emerging around us now.\nThese essential webs are filled, as we’ve seen, with complex bugs and errors and\nloopholes. They depend on design decisions whose implications resonate for\ndecades – both inside the black boxes and the external world that vibrates to their\nquiet demands. “If builders built buildings the same way programmers write\nprograms,” one famous coding lemma runs, “then the first woodpecker who came\nalong would destroy civilization.” Who would know if rot is spreading in these\nsystems? Who would stop it? Recall Paul Virilo’s line that trains produced train\naccidents, planes produced airplane accidents. So: Black Boxes?\nAs much as the work of the New Caste looks tactical in nature – what protocols to\nuse, how to engineer networks or design machine boards – the reality is that most of\nwhat they do would be blind without a strategic urge. Behind even the smallest\n122\nadvance, whether it is fingerprint recognition on your phone or some new autotranslation\napp, a set of careful, deterministic values and calculations linger. One\nfeature that defines the New Caste is unadulterated, unquestioned faith in the\ncontinued network revolution, and that the values that underlie the best programs\nmay be the values that should gird the world that depends on that same code. The\ndanger here is clear enough. “Respect, understanding and love,” Weizenbaum wrote\nas he considered ELIZA’s effects, “are not technical problems.”\nThe biggest of the platforms controlled by the New Caste herd together, remember,\nbillions of people, bind them with ever thickening cords. The revealing tics of every\nmovement in the virtual and every step or drive in the real world are marked down,\nremembered and scored. To operate the strategic levers of such a force is, in all\nreality, no less significant than leading a nation. The distinction between a CEO of a\nmajor connected firm and a head of state lies less in the depth and efficacy of their\ninfluence than in the questions of how they got such power, and how they might use\nit. The New Caste has an admirable conviction near to faith that their products are\ntruly universal. They are absolute technological determinists. Watching their\nservices and influence expand often has that strange aura of the irresistible force\ntaking on an immovable object. They believe that their black boxes will bulldoze\nconcerns of politics or history. And soon.\nHistorical ambition of this scale, the sort that touches really countless lives, has\nalways blended a commercial and technical mastery -- the moves of the East India\nCompany turned as much on better ship design, maps and navigation as on imperial\nobjectives. But the aim of the New Caste is the same as it was for those three older\ncastes – the merchants, soldiers and sages: To put the tools they’ve mastered and\nbuilt in the service of still more dominance. The commercial calculations of the most\npowerful figures of the New Caste carry a sense of seeing many moves ahead, a very\nreal kind of chess. Their billion dollar acquisitions, investment in moon-shot R&D\nideas, the hundred million dollar payouts for great engineers – all of these mark the\nastonishing scale of what they have in mind: To have and control ever more\nessential cores of power. Are they seduced by having a billion users? Sure, but not\nbecause of the billion users, but rather because of the seductive allure of the black\nbox, of what it means to control such a central point of connection.\n4.\nI remember sitting with a member of the New Caste the week the first batch of\nmimeographed and laser-scanned Snowden papers were released, as we both\ndiscovered that everyone we knew was devouring the documents. Like a novel.\nPeople were texting one another – “Have you seen this?!” – and you couldn’t get\nthrough a dinner without a debate over the technical merits of what was on display.\nThe Snowden files were fascinating to the New Caste in a way few others might\nunderstand, in the way a room of ballplayers might examine Ted Williams’s swing\nmechanics. Let me try to explain it this way: When I was younger, people called our\ngeneration – those of us born between 1965 and 1980 more or less – a generation of\nslackers. Generation X. Generation Nothing. There was an argument to be had about\n123\nthe Baby Boomers. Had they been the most destructive, selfish generation in\nAmerican history? A reaction against the selflessness of their parents? Retired to\nleave the rest of us to pay their future medical bills and oggle their underfunded\npensions, to cope with the manipulated political system they’d sued into existence.\nOr had they left a legacy of tolerance, an echo of 1968’s optimisitic energy, a firming\nof American confidence. But, anyhow, Generation X? By comparison irrelevant: A\ncollection of sad, passive slackers.\nBut the great Internet companies were largely built by Generation X. The\nfoundational experience of 1989 – the fall of the Berlin Wall – bred optimism. It\ncreated, in fact, the possibility for a new exploration. When we were told “Be\ngenerous in what you accept,” this seemed reasonable and, eventually, lucrative. The\nlogic and power of networks became apparent by itself, the moment we began\nconnecting the world. So linkage in trade and finance and friendship was pressed\nout into a new era of globalization, pushed as much by the smashing, enthusiastic\nremoval of so many historical limits as it was by the technology itself. Yes WiFi and\nTCP/IP and other advances made wiring the world possible, but I wonder if they\nwould have developed so quickly if the context for using them hadn’t provided a\nfeedback loop of such quick profit and reward and, frankly, amazement. So, in this\nfashion, we laid the groundwork for a world of billion-plus user platforms. For a\nnew concept of power.\nBut the Snowden papers were a shock. We knew him, in a sense. His mannerisms\nand thinking and technical instincts harmonized with our own. It was as if the NSA\nhad enrolled most of the digitally visible world into a twisted panopticon of a social\nnetwork, one where your “membership” began the moment one of your data\npackets was sniffed or chased along fiber optic lines. Here was a secret three billionuser\nplatform, in a sense, that had enmeshed, without their knowledge or\npermission, a tremendous chunk of humanity. People of interest. The one or two or\nthree billion people swept into systems like the NSA’s Aurora fell victim to the\npowerful leverage of scaled systems: The more people monitored by the NSA, the\nmore leads to follow, which meant still more people needed to be followed and\nknitted unwittingly into the web.\nNo one in my generation who had been around tech for long was naïve. We knew\nthat like soldiers coming back from a war there were things done on the network –\nthe spreading of danger, of inequality, of pollution – that would have to be paid for\nin balance by the benefits the system promised to bring. The immensity of what had\nbeen built already in networks was clear enough; the even greater power yet to\ncome as trillions of more connections piled together was implicit, obvious even. The\nperverse, sneaky side of this growth was known to anyone who’d spent time\nworking a connected machine. But that people of our generation could on the one\nhand listen to “Karma Police” and on the other enact the sick OK Computer logic of\nsurveillance, even name a British GCHQ monitoring program after the Radiohead\nsong? The aim: Provide \"either (a) a web browsing profile for every visible user on\n124\nthe Internet, or (b) a user profile for every visible website on the Internet.\" 177 We’d\nnot honestly thought the end of this would be a need to so deeply question or defend\nfreedom or liberty.\nThe whole idea of connectivity had begun with liberty, after all. The Fall of the Wall.\nWe’d not known or expected to lose it through the very systems we’d constructed in\nthe open space a 20-year peace had presented. So: We’d been naïve after all. We’d\nbeen united in a tacit claim that there was nothing bad about connectivity. We\nbelieved it for the most part and convinced others. We didn’t mean it that way, I felt\nthe New Caste readers of the Snowden Papers were saying to each other, paging\nthrough the sick, ineffably banal logic of those NSA Power Point presentations. They\nwere brochures for totalitarianism. If you have not read them, it is worth looking\nthem over. They have, you’ll see, all the anodyne banality of insurance company\npitches, even if the dull language was expressing something vivid, nothing less than\nthe potential murder of some very basic rights. We were reading and discussing and\ndebating the documents so avidly because, it seems to me, each of us had a kind of\nhorror of what we might have done.\nHere was a massive technological and insidious web, a totalizing virtual machine of\ncollection and analysis and instant observation and reaction. It relied, for its safe\noperation, on the humans in the loop of that sensing and seeing and machine\nthinking. And what was it, exactly, that the humans had appeared to do in the face of\nsuch urgent responsibility? Almost like that silly secretary chatting with the ELIZA\nmachine, they had suspended their sense of warm humanity in the face of the\nmagical charm of electrical promise. They had let the machine run. The whole\nsystem had been built and operated by members of the New Caste who were, in\nturn, beguiled and charmed out of a sense of certain essential limits as they stared at\nthe beautiful face of machine power.\nLooking back on his formative years, before Europe was ground up in the First\nWorld War, the powerfully brilliant and sensitive economist John Maynard Keynes\nbitterly recalled the iron certainty of his set of friends and their confident, diffident\narrogance: “We were not aware that civilization was a thin and precarious crust\nerected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained by rules\nand conventions skillfully put across and guilefuly preserved. We had no respect for\ntraditional wisdom or the restaints of custom.” 178 It was the war, then the\ndepression, then a war which taught them this expensive lesson. What is fracturing\naround us now, with our own willful and diffident support, is that very thin and\nprecarious crust, cracked and assembled as Keynes said by “the will of a very few”.\nWhat if those very few are the New Caste?\n177 The aim: GHCQ “Pullthrough Steering Group Meeting #16” available from\ntheintercept.com\n178 “We were not aware”: John Maynard Keynes, “My Early Beliefs” in Two\nMemoirs: Dr. Melchior, a Defeated Enemy, and My Early Beliefs (New York: A.M.\nKelley, 1949) 99\n125\nThe essence of the Seventh Sense will be not merely to be beguiled by our\ntechnology, by the way it smashes old systems, not to ask “Could you please leave\nthe room while I use bend these electrons to even more omnipotent control,” but\nrather – in the same instant as the networks snaps into its full power– to grasp the\nfull nature of the connected age. To see how it might be used to further, not erode,\nthe things we care most about. To ensure that if we are not among the very few, at\nleast we can guarantee that their will bends towards justice. We will see, in a\nmoment, just what that means in practice. How our best technology and our most\navid hopes for what a technological, connected future could look like might just be\nyoked together. But before we can do that, there is one final question we need to\nanswer about the networks all around us now: What, in the end, are they really for?�\n126\nChapter Eight:\n“MapReduce”: The Compression of Space and Time\nIn which we learn what networks are really, rather wonderfully, meant for.\n1.\nStarting in the springtime of 1997, the American scientist and inventor Danny Hillis\nbegan what has since become an every-few-months sort of ritual. He packed up\nfrom his home in Encino, a short drive over the Hollywood Hills from Los Angeles,\nand headed off for rural Texas for a few days that would largely defined by rock and\ndynamite. Hillis, who was born in 1956, has spent most of his life working at the\nelectron level of the world, crafting some of the most significant computer\nprocessing systems of our age. So the sort of paleolithinc earth moving he was\nheading off to manage in Texas was a departure from his usual scale. His aim was to\nwork on blasting and then refining a space in an isolated mountainside for the\nconstruction of a towering clock that he had designed, one intended to run for\n10,000 years. That ten-millennia span was not accidentally chosen. Humans, when\nHillis began his work on the clock, had been around about that long already. We\nwere, as he pictured it, at a midpoint on that 20,000 year stretch of time. Hillis and\nthe group of tinkerers, thinkers, and engineers who had backed and designed the\nclock – people such as Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, spreadsheet inventor Mitch Kapor or\ninvestor Esther Dyson – were planning on a project that would stretch as close to\neternity as they felt reasonable. “The Clock of the Long Now” they called it. I\nremember pulling into Danny’s driveway in Encino one afternoon as he prepared to\ndepart for Texas and being struck by the contrast between the lovely, innofensive\nsuburban blandness of Southern California and the tools he was taking with him to\nmake an assault not merely on a mountain, but on a whole conception of time.\nI had met Hillis in an unusual fashion. I’d been asked to chair a committee that\nwould award a million dollars to a figure who had made an essential contribution in\nthe world of technology. The directors of the foundation behind the then-new prize\nhad been, from the start, slyly dropping big names – Bill Gates! Steve Jobs! They\nhoped such a laureate would cast a bit of glamour on the first year of their award for\n“Contributions to Man’s Present Condition.” But when our committee sat down to\ntalk it over, we knew that the boldfaced names didn’t want or need a prize. They\ncertainly didn’t need a million dollars. As we considered people we all knew who’d\nmade fundamental, essential contributions but had not been as boldfaced as they\nmight have been, Danny Hillis’s name came up immediately.\nHillis had developed a revolutionary “massively parallel” computer in the 1980s.\nThe machine had helped create an entire discipline of high-speed computing by\ntying together tens of thousands of processors to tackle a problem at once.\nTraditional computers worked problems the way you or I might, step by step. Hillis’\ndesign was the equivalent of millions of minds, all moving at once. Coordinated,\nconnected and awesomely fast. In the years since, he’d played a key role in a dozen\n127\nother breakthroughs, from designing artificial intelligences to fine-tuning classified\nmilitary aircraft systems that depended on mathematics for their stability. When\nyou wander into a deep part of Google’s technical database systems, you’re touching\nhis work. When you talk to your phone, the interface bubbles with some of his\npatents. How did Baran’s 1960s idea of a survivable, packet-based system at\nARPAnet become the Internet in the 1970s and 80s? Danny was part of a cluster of\ndirty-fingernail engineers – along with engineers such as Vint Cerf and Jon Postel –\nwho’d done the work to make it possible. His centrality in that project was\nmemorialized in a famous speech he once delivered in which he described having\none of the very first email addresses in history – and then whipped out a sheaf of\nbound pages that represented the entire Internet address list at the time. It ran\nabout 50 pages. To the extent there were membership cards in the New Caste,\nDanny’s would have had a very low number. It was an easy decision for our prize\ncommittee. No Bill Gates. No Steve Jobs. So, here’s how I met Danny Hillis: I called to\ntell him he had won a million dollars. (I recommend this as a way to start a\nfriendship.)\nHillis had been a tinkerer since he was a child and never seemed to have lost the\npleasure of a wild intermingling of joy and practice. You couldn’t tell with him\nwhere passion ended and work started. He was so technically adept that he could\ninject even the coldest digital projects with a bit of hot emotion, like Bernini\nbreathing life into a block of carved marble with one, “just so” grace note of his\nchisel. One of Hillis’s most famous projects, for instance, was a 15-foot high tic-tactoe\nplaying tinkertoy robot he’d built when he was 20 years old, in his second year\nas an undergraduate at MIT in 1975. Made from 10,000 wooden spindles and poles,\nit was an early attempt of his to show how machines, even simple ones, might\nseduce us with both brains and looks. The effect of a giant tinkertoy pile sitting there\nat The Massachusets Institute of Technology had to make you giggle, even as your\nmind boggled at the fact that this heap of sticks, strings and dials was beating you\nagain and again at a child’s game. Hillis was an artist as much as an inventor – one\nreason he’d not become Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. (And why Gates and Jobs\nmaintained a consistent, admiring respect for him.) He’d once spent a decade at\nDisney designing rides or thinking up new dreams as a kind of real-world mayor of\nTomorrowland. He liked to joke that he knew he was at the right place when, on his\nfirst day, he asked where he might find a parachute harness for an experiment and\nheard, in response, “What size?”\nHillis was an avid reader, and he has the habit to think of his bleeding-edge work in\nthe context of long historical gulps. Conversations with him often tie back to\nPaleocene era biology or some other deep root. That long-term view, married to his\nunmatched hands-on feel for complicated systems, made him the ideal designer for\nthe clock, a machine intended to last millennia. The problems associated with such\nan undertaking were, honestly, as unreal as you might expect. How to power the\nclock? (Hand winding, the better to ensure it was not forgotten.) How to protect it?\n(Put in the middle of nowhere.) Did you need to plan for global climate change? (Yes.\nThe design was adjusted to accommodate shifts in the earth’s spin when the planet’s\nicecaps melt off.) Do you write a users’ manual for people 10,000 years from now?\n128\n(Yes.) Do you write it in English? (To be determined!) Working with composer Brian\nEno on the sound of the clock chime, and with a team of geologists and physicists,\nHillis had made the clock into a natural extension of his tinkertoy computer, a device\nthat both served a purpose and sent a message. If there was an emotion it conveyed,\na feeling that it tickled in the way Bernini’s Apollo and Daphne might inspire terror\nor joy or faith, it was meant to be awe.\nStewart Brand, one of the supporters of the clock and an early member of the New\nCaste too, would tell you that the idea for the clock had emerged from a desire to\nemphasize, to physicalize in a way no one could forget, the importance of longerterm\nthinking. We’d all arrived now, Brand and the other clock masters worried, at a\nmoment in history when no one had a view that extended much past their own lives\n– or sometimes past the next election, or year, or the next financial quarter. Our\nmodern “on to the next thing” economics and politics were eroding every slow,\npatient instinct. “Civilization is revving itself into a pathetically short attention\nspan,” one manifesto for the clock began. “What we propose is both a mechanism\nand a myth.” 179 With its steady 10,000 year ticking, the Clock of the Long Now was\nmeant to make us think in longer jumps. The human winding mechanism, for\ninstance: Generations of clock-winders had to share in the work, and they would be\nconnected in a long thread over the 10,000 years. A sacred priesthood of time.\nMoving slowly. As I spent time thinking, dreaming about the clock, I found myself\ntoo craving the solidity and patient isolation it promised. Who among us these days\ndoesn’t want a break from the instant nowness of our age?\nYet, the more I understood the clock, the more I realized something else was at\nwork. Stop for a moment to consider who was backing and building the device. It\nwas a cluster of people who had, as a common link, the fact that they had their hands\nhonestly sunk into the guts of the Internet. Hillis, after all, had been waving more\nthan that slim book of email addresses when he talked about the early days of the\nInternet. He was waving the credentials of a man who had been living in the virtual\ncyber neighborhood of Web connections from its very first days. He was as close to a\nnative of the connected, fiber optic, light-speed world as you could find.\nAll the names supporting the clock smelled similarly of burning electrons: Jeff Bezos\nhad built Amazon into a high-speed marketplace whose backbone was the Web\nitself. Another backer, Mitch Kapor, had cracked apart several centuries of slow\naccounting habits when he created Lotus 1-2-3, the first successful computer\nspreadsheet program in 1983, software that permitted you to see and change your\nwhole business one keystroke at a time. Kapor’s software helped move finance from\nquarter-by-quarter calculations to a really instant-by-instant sort of business – more\nor less the opposite of the “long time frame” the clock team was aiming to preserve.\nEsther Dyson was one of the earliest, best investors in network companies. This was\na collection of men and women unified by a genius for connected change, sure, but\nalso by a desire for ever faster clock speeds, ever speedier delivery, ever faster\n179 “Civilization is revving itself”: Stewart Brand, The Clock of the Long Now: Time\nand Responsibility. (New York: Basic Books, 1999) 2\n129\nprocessing. They had lived this. Enabled it. Profited from it. If there was ever a\ngroup you might hope to take aside, pull into a quiet room and ask gently What are\nthe really networks for, anyway? this would be it.\nThe act of keeping time, of marking it, is embedded in the nature of any age. Our\nlives are, after all, dictated by timetables: School schedules, the seasons, rush hour,\nthe burning candle of birth-love-marriage-death. Time, in the days before industry,\nwas measured by nature’s schedule. How long it took a crop to mature. The\nsolstices. A beehive filling with honey. It was marked by moving tides and shifting\nseasons, and it demanded a slowness, a personal presence on the shores, in the\noceans, atop the fields over generations. “Summer afternoon,” the novelist Henry\nJames remarked in a précis of a slower age he felt passing away in 1895. “To me\nthose have always been the two most beautiful words in the English language.” 180\nThen, in the industrial revolution, time became money. Electric lights, for instance,\nundid the restful distinction between night and day – and made 24-hour life and\nmanufacturing and economics possible and then, of course, inevitable. Movement\nfrom countryside to city established a really new sense of what the German critic\nGeorg Simmel, writing in 1903, called tempo. “With each crossing of the street, with\nthe tempo and multiplicity of economic, occupational and social life, the city sets up\na deep contrast with small town and rural life,” he explained. “The technique of\nmetropolitan life is unimaginable without the most punctual integration of all\nactivities and mutual relations into a stable and impersonal time schedule.” 181 Punch\ncards. Bus schedules. The forty hour work week. Our education, our manufacturing,\nour markets and our lives all began to run on timetables. They had to, or the whole\nproject of industry would collapse. “Summer Afternoon” became a time to work.\nSimmel worried, for instance, over the diffusion of pocket watches. To carry one was\nlike looking at a constantly draining bank account.\nThis sense of humans reduced to cogs – churned, run, disposed of on a schedule not\ntheir own – unnerved the residents of that first mechanical age. Cities had been the\nvery first sorts of tight-packed networks; industrial cities ratcheted this further still.\nThey succeeded and failed by the degree to which they geared themselves and their\ncitizens to machine speed. When the Austrian novelist Robert Musil began The Man\nWithout Qualities, his classic story of the era, with the flattening of a Viennese citizen\nby a speeding delivery truck, he meant to point out how urban speed and urban life\n(and urban death) had become inseparable. And also the mismatch between the\nweak breaks of the age and it’s acceleration. The book is alive with that pre-accident\nslipping sensation you may have had: You are pressing hard on the brakes of the car;\nyou are going to hit something anyhow. “Cities can be recognized by their pace just\nas people can by their walk,” Musil wrote in a line that any modern New Yorker or\n180 “Summer afternoon”: Edith Wharton, A Backwards Glance, (New York: D.\nAppleton-Century, 1934) See chapter 10 for her tale of an afternoon with James.\n181 “With each crossing”: Georg Simmel, “The Metropolis and Mental Life” (1903)\nin Gary Bridge and Sophie Watson, eds. The Blackwell City Reader. Oxford and\nMalden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 11\n130\nParisian would endorse. 182 “A man returning after years of absence would have\nknown, with his eyes shut, that he was in that ancient capital and imperial city,\nVienna.” To really get a feel for that age, watch just a few frames of Russian director\nDizga Vertov’s jittery 1929 black and white film Man with a Movie Camera 183 . Each\nmoment of the movie is alive with the tension of a new, rushing and industrial age.\nYou won’t be surprised Vertov’s list of requirements as he prepared to start filming\nbegan: “1. A rapid means of transportation.” His aim was to immortalize urban\nspeed on the new medium film; he knew he needed to be fast. 184\nTo know a city by it’s pace. Musil was touching something deep here, an instinct that\nbeats in each of us and runs from this fact: The speed of an event affects how we\nperceive it. The difference between what you will notice when walking up a hill –\nchirping bugs, tiny rocks, changes in color and gradient – and driving up that hill is\nso complete as to be almost different experiences entirely. 185 When the whole world\ntumbles upon us at fiber-optic speed, when invasions and revelations and accidents\nall spread at the rate of WiFi or cell phone radiation, our sense of time blurs. You\nhave to wonder what Simmel would have made of a smart phone. “It is not merely\nthat the medium is the message, but the velocity of the medium,” Paul Virlio\nobserved once in one of his many studies on speed and mind. 186\nLife in our connected age is both instant and always on, what Simmel might have\ncalled “the technique of network life.” This demolishes an older, easier sense of pace.\nComputers were once switched on at 9 and off at 5 – just like their human masters.\nBut digital activity is constant now. The networks are paying attention all the time.\nThey have to. Our machines – tractors and trains and cars – used to echo our pace of\nlife. Now we echo theirs. The machines, the New Caste, the black boxes – they tick\nalong constantly, ever faster. We rely on them, as we’ve seen, for our safety. We\nwant them to be fast. To be instant. But what is this doing to us? Is completely\nunhooking us from any sense of time really a good idea?\nIt was certainly true, as Brand insisted, that the Clock of the Long Now was meant as\na reminder, as a kind of constant totem to the fact that we’re all just a small tick on\n182 “Cities can be recognized”: Robert Musil, The Man Without Qualities Vintage\n(1996) 3\n183 To really get a feel: Vertov’s movie is shot in Moscow, Kiev, Odessa and Krakow.\nIn 2003 The Cinematic Orchestra produced a modern soundtrack to accompany it.\n184 “A rapid means”: Jonathan Dawson, “Dziga Vertov” Great Directors March 2003\nIssue 25\n185 Ajahn Brahm of the Buddhist Society of Western Australia tells a wonderful story\nin his Dharma talks about a day in which he decided not to be driven up the road to\nhis monastery in Perth, but instead walked the road. He was flooded by the\nsensations of nature, all invisible from the inside of a car. One way to change your\nperspective, he means, is to change the speed at which you are moving through life.\nSee the Buddhist Society of Western Australia website for a catalog of his talks.\n186 “It is not merely that the medium”: Paul Virilio, Information Bomb trans. Chris\nTurner (London: Verso, 2000), 141\n131\nthe endless long continuum. We do think in too short a time frame. But the clock\nalso, I began to suspect as I considered it, had another role. Those 10,000 years of\nmarked time were an attempt to scratch an itch bothering these pioneers of\ncyberspace. It might even have been a sort of guilty sensation. After all, there was\nsomething that they had demolished in their ceaseless fast connecting of the world –\nmaybe accidentally, but anyhow it could never be put back to where it was. If the\ngreat industrial titans before them had, over several hundred years, vanquished\ndistance, lacing the world with trading networks, the men and women behind the\nclock were fracturing something else, something that for all of human history had\nseemed the only reliable, safe, sad constant of our condition: Time. For most of\nhistory, time and space were seen as facts, immutable forces that could not be\novercome or adjusted or fought. Time particularly. The quintessential, tragically\nnon-negotiable condition of life. The backers of the clock were, in their “day jobs”, in\nthe business of overcoming, adjusting, fighting and even destroying an older sense\nof time. What might once have taken years, they were committed to making happen\nin an instant.\nThe Long Now project, then, was like one of those carefully isolated arctic freezers,\nwhere samples of essential grains and DNA from Beethoven’s hair and Einstein’s\nbrain are sunk and iced against the godforbid day in which our basic feedstock or a\nchunk of humanity has been wiped out by accident or disaster. Blasted into a\nmountain hole, designed to last thousands of years, the clock is a repository for time\nitself. It is a defensive museum, built against the moment when instant networks\nfinally devour the off switch and kill an older, essential feeling of time. The clockmakers\nknew, I think, that they had helped to demolish a particular sense of pace\nwith their fast, instant networks. They wanted, with the knowledgeable keening of\nthe guilty, a new device, one carefully gated away from the very revolution they\nwere encouraging with their business and technical obsessions. This hunger for\nspeed had built their fortunes. Their revolution (and its IPOs) had paid for the clock,\nfrankly. And the hope for “instant world” had inspired their dreams long before\ndeep, fast connections were possible. Bezos’s first name for Amazon, Cadabara,\ncaptured just this sense of waving wands and the eye-blink “Now you don’t see it,\nnow you do!” appearance of just what you want or need. Murdering time. You could\nask: What are the really networks for anyway? Would they feel guilty when they\nconfessed?\n2.\nDanny Hillis’s father was an epidemiologist. His mother was a bio-statistician. And\nhis childhood was a blur of infection-led family migrations. “Anywhere in the world\nthere was an epidemic, we would go,” he recalled. As the family bounced from Dehli\nto Cairo to Dakha to Nairobi, racing diseases one after another, Danny developed a\nvivid, energetic autodidactisism. He would collect knowledge from his parents, from\nthe streets around him, his new friends, anywhere. In a library in Calcutta, for\ninstance, he once found a copy of George Boole’s 1854 book “An Investigation Into\nthe Laws of Thought”. Boole invented symbolic logic on those pages and though his\ninstincts were grounded in an age of steam and machines, his vision still echoes in\n132\nmodern computer design. “Language,” Boole wrote, “is an instrument of human\nreason, and not merely a medium for the expression of thought.” 187\nHillis has a magnetic intellectual charisma, as you might have guessed by now. An\nafternoon with him resembles nothing so much as a lingering mental theme park:\nRoller coasters of big ideas (a 10,000 year clock!) mixed with smaller sugary treats\n(how to design a better fencepost). No wonder he fit in so well at Disney. Critics\naccused Steve Jobs of having a “reality distortion field”, in which the Apple founder’s\ncharisma bludgeoned the boundaries of the practical. Hillis, by contrast, has a sort of\n“reality enhancement field” in which much of the world as seen through his eyes or\nheard in his light-hearted voice is sharper, filled with possibility.\nFrom an early age Hillis had been interested in the dream of a thinking robot. Maybe\nit was that the constant uprooting of his childhood left him with a giddy sense that it\nwas easier to assemble your own friends than to try to make them new at each stop.\nBut somehow this led him to the idea of an artificial brain, which was Danny’s main\nidea when he arrived at MIT in the fall of 1972. The tinker-toy tic-tac-toe computer\nhe built was a nod to this hope, but it’s jerry-rig aesthetic masked deeper ambitions.\n“Someday, perhaps soon, we will build a machine that will be able to perform the\nfunctions of a human mind,” Hillis wrote at the start of his PhD thesis a few years\nlater. “A thinking machine.” 188\nWhat Hillis and others like his mentor Marvin Minsky, realized was that the human\nbrain works differently than machine logic. Life, after all, is not a series of linear\nmath problems. (Much as we might wish it was at times.) You look outside. It occurs\nto you to say to your wife, “What a lovely day.” This is not a result of some “a then b\nthen c” calculation, but rather the product of thousands of simultaneous inputs and\ntwitches dancing through the space of your consciousness. If you were to process\nthat same thought in a linear fashion, it might look like this: First, look at the sky,\nexamine the cloud-to-blue ratio, check for too much wind, sense the temperature,\nopen mouth. Your wife would be out the door before you’d even begun to speak. The\nability to operate on many different pieces of data all at once is one of the most\nstriking, enviable features of the human mind. But of course, you’ve probably,\nrecognized: That is fundamentally a network problem. How do you act instantly,\neverywhere? Connection. So it was that, a dozen years after his tic-tac-toe machine,\nHillis began work on a device designed to think super fast. Faster than any computer\never had. He called it The Connection Machine. “The ability to configure the topology\nof the machine to match the topology of the problem will turn out to be one of the\nmost important features of the Connection Machine,” he wrote. Adding, in case the\n187 “Language”: George Boole, An Investigation of the Laws of Thought: On Which Are\nFounded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities.

Thesis\nSubmission, MIT (1985) p. 2\n133\nacademic panel at MIT missed the point: “(That is why it is called the Connection\nMachine.)” 189\nHillis’s ambition to build this device boiled in him while he was at MIT, and it finally\noutstripped what MIT could support, so he gathered a group of students and started\na small company. The Thinking Machines Corporation, blessed by some combination\nof Hillis’s charisma and the fantastic promise of the project, became a magnetic field\nfor talent, ideas and money. In the early days of the firm, for instance, the hunt for\ninvestors led Danny to the luxurious New York City apartment of William Paley, the\nfounder of CBS. Hillis lived then in a ramshackle house close to campus at MIT. He\ndrove a surplus fire truck to work most days. 190 Faced with the urbane, powerful 81-\nyear old founder of the largest radio and TV network in America, Danny jumped\nright into a passionate introduction of his ideas about connection and networks.\nPaley, cooly: \"I didn't understand a word you said.\" Then: A check for $5 million.\nOr there was the time that Hillis asked Nobel-prize winning physicist Richard\nFeynman to tip him off about any smart scientists Thinking Machines might hire.\nFeynman, pushing 60, volunteered himself and spent his summer vacations for the\nnext ten years with Hillis and his team. 191 When it came time to test the first\nConnection Machine, it was Feynman’s data that revealed how well the black box\nwas doing its job. The architecture they had designed cranked through what would\nhave been a month’s worth of complex chromodynamics problems in hours. As the\nmachine got better, these already fast processing times improved by another factor\nof 1,000. Such a machine, for scientists who were desperate for computed answers,\nwas like adding years to their life. If they could solve a problem in a week instead of\nyears? The whole texture of their careers would be altered.\n“At times,” one fellow computer developer remarked, “the Connection Machine\nseems so different from current computers that it seems more akin to science fiction\nthan high technology.” 192 Thinking Machines Corporation sold Danny’s computers to\nLockheed to model stealth fighters. Chevron used one to model oil fields. The US\ngovernment bought several to help to predict the weather. Puzzles long resistant to\nmere power melted in the face of parallel consideration. Nothing was more exciting\nabout Hillis’s machines than this intimiate, unprecedented link between intelligence\nand speed. If you have twice as many processors as I do, you can perhaps crack a\npuzzle of genomics or cryptography a year faster. But say you have figured out how\nto have 275,000 machines linked together and I have 1,000? You can solve a\n189 Adding: Hillis thesis, p. 19\n190 He drove: Po Bronson, “The Long Now: Time Traveling with Danny Hillis”, Wired\n(May, 1998)\n191 Feynman: W.

Between 2007 and 2015 the number of connections a\nHillis-style neural computer could handle grew from 1 million to 100 billion. This\nspeed did produce things very like science fiction: Accurate voice recognition. Realtime\ngenetics. And it also began to mark out, clearly, the powerful network territory\nwhere our future will be decided.\n3.\nOf all the things that mark a change between our modern lives and the days of those\nwho came before us, few are as sensationally obvious as the sheer acceleration of\nlife, the reduction of delay and the emerging instantness of experience. Faster. What\nis going on inside the machines, as Mel Conway’s old law would have told us, is\nhappening too on the surface of our lives. A feeling of breathlessness in the face of\nspeed isn’t new, of course. When Anna Karenina folds herself under an oncoming\ntrain at the end of Tolstoy’s novel, for instance, her suicide is as much metaphor as\npersonal tragedy, a comment on the disorienting steam, engine, and rail pace of\nmodernity. Speed kills, old habits and ideas particularly. Between 1840 and 1940\ntravel times between Anna’s St. Petersburg and Vronsky’s Moscow shrunk by 10\nminutes every year on average, loosing deep cracks in Russian economics and\npolitics, tearing apart Anna’s slow-moving world of glittering balls and hereditary\nestates with the fast force of industry, modernity and then the awful pliers of\ncommunism. Tolstoy’s own death in 1910 held a bit of this acute tension between\nold and new velocities: At 82, hoping to live out his final days in the peace of a small\nhut, he left his family for the rural Russian town of Sharmardino. By train. He died at\na station on the way, stopped quite literally, like an absurd figure in a Gogol novel, as\nhe was enacting the tragedy of trying to use the modern to get to the past.\nAt the same time in the late 19 th Century, the American rail system was working its\nown transformation, but with almost no ambivalence. America was using the\nmodern to get to the future – as fast as possible. This was a decisive difference in\ntemperament. “The American frontier,” Frederick Jackson Turner wrote in his\nfamous 1894 essay about borders and American life, “is sharply distinguished from\nthe European frontier—a fortified boundary line running through dense\npopulations.” 195 American rails and roads (and trade) encountered no substantial\nfortifications. They ran nearly unchecked into the wilderness. The only apparent\nlimit to expansion, that generation thought, was technology itself. The trains had,\nfrom the start, an unusual purchase in American life. During the three decades after\n1840, the refinement of small but important details – faster train engines, stiffer\ncarriage design, tracks that were straighter, an ability to move and re-load boxcars\nat night, better time-table management – eased America into the steam engine age\n193 You can solve: Adam Beberg lecture “Distributed Systems: Computation with a\nmillion friends”, speech at Stanford University Computer Systems Colloquium (April\n30, 2008) available online\n195 “The American frontier”: Frederick Jackson Turner, “The Significance of the\nFrontier in American History”, The Annual Report of the American Historical\nAssociation, 1894, pp. 119-227\n135\nat faster a pace than any nation. “The most significant thing about the American\nfrontier,” Turner explained, “is that it lies at the hither edge of free land.”\nThis brisk acceleration of rail transit revealed an axiom of speed that matters to us\nstill: The faster your speed, the less distance matters. Accelerate from five to fifty to\nfive hundred miles an hour and the mileage becomes less significant with each notch\non the speedometer. It all takes the same amount of time. Marx called the process\n“the annihilation of space by time”. He was right. Speed kills distance. The simple\nalgebra linking increased speed and reduced distance had been apparent already in\nthe shift from rowed galleys to sailing ships, but the age of industrial transport by\nrail or air meant that rapid changes, changes that affected the very quality of\nmovement, took place within the time frame of a single lifetime. The acceleration\nfrom horseback to train to plane happened over a period of 150 years or so. Each\nnew acceleration diminished the impact of distance.\nThere’s a phrase for this process – “Space-Time Compression” – first identified by\nthe American sociologist Donald Janelle in 1965 196 . Janelle saw that the technologies\nof transportation, trains and planes and boats, and all the little innovations that\nmade them move ever-faster, were disrupting old spatial habits. They helped move\ngoods more quickly, sure, but in the process they were also making the old,\ngeographic maps less useful. When you could fly over a mountain, its importance\ndiminished. In a wagon train you might have contemplated the desert with fear, by\ncar you’d merely consider it with care. In a plane it was irrelevant. Janelle concluded\nthat raw economics drove this compression as much as science. Centuries of\nconstantly collapsing space and time had been driven not least by the hunger to\npoke into distant markets, to latch onto cheap labor, and to pull natural resources to\nwherever they were needed. This was “civilization” as a verb.\nThe demands for ever more commerce, ever faster, ever more profitably suggested\nthat the horses-to-trains-to-cars-to jets acceleration was an inevitable feature of\nmodern markets. We should expect it to continue, Janelle figured. Great fortunes\nwould accumulate to those who mastered speed. To be fast is a competitive\nadvantage; to be faster! decisive. Absolute speed is absolute power, as the philosopher\nPaul Virilio has framed it. 197 That idea of “Space Time Compression” sounded\nfelicitous enough, like the name of a clever magic trick. Space compressed? Time\nreduced? But that felicity hid the violent, revolutionary nature of the mechanism so\npowerfully at work. It meant that the battlefields of power, which for most of human\nhistory had been over the control of space, would now become – rather incredibly –\nabout the control of time.\n196 There’s a phrase: Janelle identified what he called “Space-Time Convergence;”\nLater geographer David Harvey renamed it as “Space Time Compression,” which is\nmore commonly used today.\n197 Absolute speed: See Armitage, John, Ed. The Virilio Dictionary (Edinburgh:\nEdinburgh University Press, 2013)\n136\nJanelle published his first paper on space-time compression in 1965 in the pages of\nthe reference journal of mapmakers, The Professional Geographer. But he was, of\ncourse, blowing up nearly everything professional geography thought it was about.\n“Geographers, as physicists, have traditionally been concerned with the positions of\npoints (places) in space,” he wrote. “However, geographers have not employed the\nconcept of ‘velocity’ in studying spatial relationships. Yet it might be of value and not\ntoo far-fetched for the geographer to ask ‘at what ‘velocities’ are settlements\napproaching one another?’” We should ask ourselves the same question. At what\nvelocity are you and I getting closer to other points on the planet? Janelle was\nwriting in 1965. He was concerned then about the sound barrier as the practical\nlimit to speed. But imagine his insights applied to an age where networks are\nswitched always on, constantly packing the world ever tighter? Where a mistake or\nan innovation or an attack in one place can happen instantly and everywhere,\nbecause the speed limit is the speed of light?\n4.\nAt first glance, of course, geography seems the least dynamic of sciences. It is rooted\nin the glacial-paced realities of geology, a discipline where speed is usually\nmeasured in the creaking, inches-a-century advance of tectonic plates. The faster\nlinks of transportation, whether they are trains or planes or data connections, lay\nblanket-like atop that slower-moving geological layer. These high-velocity networks\nare, in a way, a new geography. Mathematicians and data architects call the\nlandscape they represent a “topology”. The word refers to maps that can be rearranged\nas a result of connection, the way in which speed and distance between\ntwo points does affect how “far apart” they are. You can think of it this way:\nGeographies are pretty much constant; topologies can change in an instant. In\ngeographic terms, Moscow and St. Petersburg are always 450 miles apart.\nWhen you hear a network engineer talk about designing for a certain “topology” you\nshould think of hearing an architect describe the natural geography where a bridge\nor a sky-scraper will one day sit. When you use an app, link to a finance market, or\nwire yourself with sensors you’re connecting to a topology that has been designed\nand mapped – and where what you can do is determined by that landscape. An\nappreciation for tone and movement on a topology is a sign the new sensibility we\nhave called the Seventh Sense. Napoleon saw the battlefields of his age differently\nthan his enemies. They saw flat surfaces for the collision of soldiers, he saw a third\ndimension, saw air filled with artillery and decisive top-down dominance. Our\nSeventh Sense masters, those who can perceive a new order emerging, see wired\ntopologies in this same fresh way. Even though these landscapses are often invisible\nor made up only of narrow fiber strings, it’s important that we try to picture\nnetwork topologies as real, as alive and buzzing and rich with connection and data,\nplaces where fortunes will be made and lost, wars fought – and every bit as\ninfluential as physical geography.\nTopologies represent the landscape where real-world edifices like the Web or the\nNYSE or Hizballah are built. They can change shape, instantly, depending on who is\n137\nconnected, and by the speed and thickness of that connection. The topology of Wall\nStreet in the 1920s, for instance, was largely defined by who happened to come to\nthe trading floor on a given day; today it is a global landscape, influenced by news,\nrumors and real-time profit twitches anywhere on the planet. Just like moving a\nriver from one place to another would radically change the utility of a bridge, a\nchange in topology changes the shape of systems that depend on it. That Seventh\nSense instinct – the powerful can become useless because of connection, the useless\ncan become powerful – is earned first through a fluency and even faith in these sorts\nof rapid, fate-changing topological shifts.\nIn recent years the topologies of our network world have changed at the pace of\ntechnology, which is very fast indeed. Every new piece of a network, every new\nplatform or protocol, alters how we connect. This process works on our sense of\ndistance like an efficient, strange sewing machine: Something very far away can be,\nsuddenly, with one stitch of innovation, right on top of you. The speed and the\nquality of a connection is what determines how honestly “near” or “far” something\nis. Location is, in a sense, as changeable as velocity. 198\nDistance, on any living, networked web, is an endlessly pliable sheet. Just as you can\nbring two distant points on a piece of paper right next to each other by folding the\nsheet, so you can glue points in networks together by bending the space on which\nthey are connected. A map of the networked world or of nations or even of our city\nis not some given, settled graph. One small twist and we are, like it or not, right on\ntop of each other. This makes it particularly murderous to hold onto the old idea\nthat you and I are unconnected points. Do countries like America or China have\nlegitimate interests thousands of miles away from their coastlines? Of course. 199 In\nthis way, the entire premise of Enlightenment life, the atomic focus on the power of\nthe individual, becomes dangerous.\nIt is now essential to use virtual topologies to operate in the real world, to bend\nthese ethereal elements of connection to influence and even total control. Thomas\nDullien, one of the researchers who discovered that “rowhammer” chip hack\ncaptured this in a new law of network security that echoes, in fact, through all of\nconnected life: You don’t have to possess an object in order to control it. “Being\nhacked,” he explained in a 2011 speech called Why Johnny Can’t Tell If He’s\nCompromised, “is loss of control without change of ownership or possession.” 200\nYour phone, resting constantly in your pocket, may in fact be pwned at every\nkeystroke by someone thousands of miles away. This is an extremely important\nidea, an expression again of how connection changes the nature of an object: It\nmakes it controllable without possession. An army might be able to master an\n198 Location: John May and Nigel Thrift eds.

Networks, you\nrecall we said, will break nations in the future. This is just how such smashing\ncontrol will be achieved, from the linked mesh running silently and irreplaceably\nunder every element of national life. Today billion-dollar firms control cars, tools,\nor hotel rooms without possessing them. The links draw out value. Michaelangelo’s\nfamous urging resonates here: Every block of stone has a sculpture inside of it, and it\nis the task of the sculptor to discover it. Every network has a topology. It is the task of\neach of us to discover it.\nTopologies linger everywhere there is connection. Networks can be designed in\ncountless ways: The fishnets of Baran, the hub and spoke of a data center, the everchanging\nmesh of a trading system. But what they all share is connective topologies\nof one sort or another and – as a result – the fact that risk that lingers any one place\nin the system also exists nearly any other linked place. Constant connection\nproduces, as an unsettling result, constant threat. Connection spreads, distant parts\nof the world are superglued via that topological folding. Topology is not marked out\nmerely by a description of how we connect. Rather it is scored on what is called a\n“trust graph”, a kind of map of who you or a machine or a network trusts – and how\nmuch. An older generation still thinks a network is something made of wires and\nswitches and plugs. But their real power comes from something far more ethereal.\nWhen you connect to a person or an object, you connect as well to its whole history\nof decisions about who to trust. Every EU country connects to the choices of a single\nborder guard, for instance. Who does he trust? Is he right? Financial systems and\ntechnology webs are the same. If you are what you are connected to, you are also –\nrather unnervingly – the sum of every trusting (or untrusting) choice someone or\nsome machine has made. This creates a worrying result: “In the systems we’ve built\nnow,” Dullien has explained, “there is no way to establish who is in control.” If you\nor anyone you’re linked to has made a trust mistake, you may be pwned, vulnerable,\nand one hacked slice from loss of control.\nAny object – your tablet computer, a digital currency, a hacked drone – can become\ndangerous now in this sense, hacked by Warez Dudes into lethality. And nearly any\nplace can be attacked in some fashion or another, as long as it is connected. The old\nchestnut of military strategy, that a clever or desperate army can always “trade\nspace for time” –make a gradual retreat in order to buy time, is nearly gone now.\nSpace is a wall that can be breached by time manipulation tools; there’s no place to\nretreat to. Markets in Mongolia, airports in Europe, Chinese urban landscapes – all of\nthese now can be struck, more or less at any time, because they are all connected.\nUnlike traditional conflict, where the location of your most terrifying dangers might\nbe exactly pinpointed and watched, where military zones and civilian zones were\ncarefully divided by front lines, a connected world is one of potential universal\nperil. 201 The distinction between battlefield and everyday streets disappears and it\n201 Unlike traditional conflict: Derek Gregory, “The Everywhere War” The\nGeographical Journal, Vol. 177, No. 3, September 2011, pp. 238–250\n139\ntakes with it – if we don’t handle this properly – something even more precious: The\ndivision between periods of peace and of war.\nThat the knotting together of distance, speed and power changes the nature of an\nobject was something Janelle, the father of “Space Time Compression,” anticipated.\nHe labeled it “Locational Utility”, the way in which something becomes more useful\nor powerful or relevant as it is drawn closer to us by increased connection and\nspeed, even if it stays the same “distance” away 202 . A nuclear weapon three hours\nfrom landing and one that is three months away are, nearly, a different object\nentirely. Adam Smiths’s famous remark in his Theory of Moral Sentiments that most\npeople would be more perturbed by the loss of half a finger than the news that a\nmillion Chinese had perished, begins to take on a different color in an age when a\nbillion and a half Chinese are nanoseconds away. 203 When we say that connection\nchanges the nature of an object, we mean this; Networks change the “locational\nutility” of anything they touch. When connection makes an object instantly, clearly\nvisible, it revolutionizes its potential. Little wonder so many great fortunes are being\nmade in applying this trick of plugging goods into compression engines like apps or\nmatching services. It’s hard to know if firms like Airbnb or Uber will be around in a\ndecade, but the economic energy they release emerges right out of Janelle’s theories:\nConnect a car seat or an empty room and you change its nature. You give it value.\nPart of our unease now – and part of the problem we have in strategizing about the\nworld or our businesses – is that stability on our topological maps is some time off\nyet. There is so much yet to be connected. So many new topologies to be built.\n“Time is a ride,” Danny Hillis once remarked in an early meditation about his rocksunk\nclock, “and you are on it.” 204 He was right. That ride takes place, in a connected\nage, on topological rails. And just how “instant” you are will be a mark of what sort\nof ride you’re on. In the same way that rivers and oceans and mountains define\ndifferent landscapes in real geographies, topological neighborhoods too will each\nbounce with funny quirks. Some will be super fast. Others yoked by politics. Citizens\nof Santa Fe or Mumbai may choose to compress time in different ways. But they will\nall share a common desire. To do more with less. The German philosopher Peter\nSloterdjik, writing about the way in which some people breeze through airports and\nborders (with first class tickets and pre-approved immigration) while others\nstruggle to move at all out of refugee camps or poverty traps, has labeled the\nwinners of this new order as a kind of “kinetic elite” 205 . They are a kind of temporal\nelite, in possession of golden keys to a special, frictionless topology. The technology\nto eliminate space and capture time.\n202 He labeled it: Donald G. Janelle, “Spatial Reorganization: A Model and Concept”,\nAnnals of the Association of American Geographers (Volume 59, Issue 2, 1969)\n203 Adam Smith’s: famous remark: Adam Smith and Knud Haakonssen.

(New York: Basic Books, 1999), 67\n205 The German philosopher: Sloterdjik, TK\n140\nThe computing programming technology that lingers inside most data centers now\nand that makes sense of the ceaselessly arriving bits – Here is information on a\nbillion people. How many are named Bob? – is known as MapReduce. The name\ncombines two well-know computer fuctions, Map and Reduce, and it is just the sort\nof program Janelle and Hillis would have dreamed up, had they ever met.\nMapReduce divides computation work among thousands of machines, just the sort\nof massive parallelism Hilli had in mind. What it implicitly does, however, is crunch\nwhat might have taken years into microseconds. If the charmed phrase of James’\nstately Victorian elites more than a century ago was “Summer Afternoon,” ours\nmight be “MapReduce”, a kind of magic two word code for a whole way of living and\nthinking.\n5.\nThe most successful political and economic systems of the past, the ones that\nmarked the winning “convergence” club of humanity’s last great leap, let people\nliberate themselves into a life of their dreams. Liberty meant tearing down old\nbarriers to influence and security and knowledge; tipping over the Bastille, escaping\ncolonialism. And it meant, too, providing a scaffolding of education, of social\nsupport, of laws and stability for citizens. The industrial, urban and rich countries\nthat populate our world now evolved that way because their citizens made them so.\nThey escaped the tyranny of the pre-modern, of a world where the small town you\nwere born in and the pattern of your parents’ life were a kind of prision for your\nhopes. This was the whole trick of the Enlightenment, after all: What do you want to\nbe? You decide! What do you want your nation to be? Decide that too. Dare to know!\nLook ahead now. The very best future political and economic arrangements will\nneed to do something more than simply liberate us. They will have to enable and\npermit citizens to compress time. Just as the idea of a democracy was shocking once,\nthis concept of a system tuned not merely for liberty but for compression of time\nshould rattle us a bit. Certainly the attempt to achieve such an aim, to build the\nscaffolds and rails a time compressed world demands, will jostle much of what\nexistst now. But to be modern means, in essence, the right, the ability to engage in\ncompression. Nations or corporations or ideologies that can deliver this liberty of\nvelocity – and that can construct and manage the flat-out fast, networked, artificially\ntopologies such a life demands – will grow, thrive, accelerate even faster. The others,\nslowed by history or blocked by social or ideological designs, will miss the turn.\nThey will be the new divergence club. Fast networks will elude them. Self-defense\nwill be impossible; their time will be as vulnerable to easy manipulation and attack\nas the resources of China and Africa and Latin America were in the face of greedy\ncolonialist plunder several hundred years ago.\nThere is no equality of justice between the weak and the strong, the Italian historian\nGiambattista Vico once noted. 206 So in our age. Between the fast and the slow? No\n206 Vico, New Science\n141\nequality either. Partly this is because of something Janelle spotted: The remarkable\nadvantage, the wealth and opportunity, that accrues to the people and nations and\nbusinesses that can compress space and time. Die Ware liebt das Geld, Marx\nfamously wrote: Commodities love money. Speed is now the decisive commodity –\nand it loves money. (The feeling is mutual.) Velocity lets us achieve that ancient goal\nof doing more with less. The race for speed lights something competitive: The faster\nI go, the faster you feel you need to go, the more powerfully you feel your slowness.\nThe centripetal charm of acceleration, the way that speed attracts us, and then\nmakes us demand even more speed, honestly surprised the earliest architects of\nsteamships and rail and airlines and roads. They under-guessed how popular their\ntools of space-time compression would be. Surely the maximum number of people\nwho would ever want to zip from LA to New York would be about 1,000 per week,\njet airline pioneers assumed. Would more than a few hundred engineers really want\ntheir own computers, Gordon Moore asked at a dinner party shortly after Intel\nproposed putting his chips in the first PCs. Yes, it turned out. Billions more. Highway\ndesigners call this surprise “induced traffic”: The faster a highway, the more people\npile onto it. Urban planners in Los Angeles in the 1950s looked at their packed,\ncongested roads and thought they could fix them by adding lanes. They embarked\non construction programs, tore up the transportation network that girded the city\nand built a new one featuring optimistic 20-lane highways as wide as a football field\nand flat as a plate. Traffic got worse.\nSay’s famous economic law that “supply creates its own demand” seems especially\nfulfilled in an age where velocity is so valuable. Speed too creates its own demand.\nThe faster any one piece of the network starts to rattle and move, the more\nprofoundly we notice how slow the leftover bits are. We want them accelerated too.\nTotal network bandwidth grew by an heroic factor of 1000 times between 2005 and\n2010. Speed? It increased by just 20 times. Induced traffic.\nWhat is it, exactly, that we’re so hungry for? The extreme end of fast connectivity is\nwhat computer systems designers call “statefulness” – a word that has nothing to do\nwith states like nations, but rather with the condition of a connection, the “state” it\nis in. Early electrical circuits were either in a charged or uncharged “state”, switched\non or off. Today when we talk about a “stateful” connection, we mean a link that we\nmaintain, always on. It’s the difference between a video call and a letter, between\nlooking at your wife here and now (a “stateful connection”) and a photograph of her\n(“stateless”). Real-time everywhere connection doesn’t merely kill distance; it\nattacks delay too. Older generations would “break state” when they left family at\nhome or friends at school with a “see you later.” Our generation? “See you always”.\nWe never quite leave. Technology permits us to remain in constant touch this way,\nto neve break state. “We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we\ndid, that’s what I’d want in life,” the milenial writer Marina Keegan wrote in a\nfamous essay that captured more than a little of this zeitgeist. “More than finding the\nright job or city or spouse – I’m scared of losing this web that we’re in. This elusive,\n142\nindefinable, opposite of loneliness.” 207 The early interface of Snapchat, where you\nhad to leave your finger resting on the screen in order for the video to unspool, was\na kind of metaphor for this unbreakable relationship between touch and connection.\n(As was, in a different way, the diffident “out of my life” left swipe of Tinder.)\n“Good theories of the mind,” Hillis’ mentory Marvin Minksy once observed, “must\nspan at least three different scales of time: slow, for the billion years in which our\nbrains have evolved; fast, for the fleeting weeks and months of infancy and\nchildhood; and in between, the centuries of growth of our ideas through history.” 208\nWhat we face now is a new time scale to add to Minksy’s list: The instant. Super-fast\nnetworks are different than slower ones – even ones as “slow” as what we have\ntoday. The ideal network is one that hovers near zero latency, where the time\nbetween what you want (or what the machines want) and the effect is as short as\npossible. You click a button to watch a movie and it starts instantly. You want to shut\ndown an enemy air force, you do it with a single switch. The fantasy of a really “zero\nlatency” system is impossible of course because even electrons moving through\ncopper are not instant, but near-zero? Light-speed? You’ve probably heard stories of\nhigh-frequency stock traders who move next door to exchanges so they can capture\nand profit on an extra sliver of a millisecond. That’s the quest for low latency. (And\nmore proof of the profitable link between speed and money.) Our challenge will not\nbe about being faster – the technology will make that inevitable – it will be about\nmanaging the insane, still unknown demands of a world of suddenness. “In a\ndistributed system, it is sometimes impossible to say that one of two events\noccurred first,” computer engineer Leslie Lamport wrote at the start of his famous\nessay “Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System” – a sort of\ntechnological parallel to Simmel’s “The Metropolis and Mental Life” written a\ncentury earlier. The problem, Lamport explains, is that what happens in one place\ncan happen nearly instantly everywhere. There’s no time to react; so your entire\nworldview has to be capable of update at an instant’s notice. When the time\nbetween a Warez Dude finding an exploit and your own systems being\ncompromised is zero, then the discovery of the hole and the creation of your\nvulnerability happen effectively at the same time. “The relation ‘happened before’”,\nLamport explains, “is therefore only a partial ordering of the events in the system.\nWe have found that problems often arise because people are not fully aware of this\nfact and its implications.” 209\nNetworks, we are discovering, don’t only compress space and time, they are\ncompressing in the process the path to knowledge. We might call this “skill-time\ncompression”: Techniques that once took a decade of training or that demanded\naccess to million-dollar machines, can now be understood, applied, and then evolved\n207 “More than finding”: Marina Keegan, The Opposite of Lonelinenss”, Yale Daily\nNews, May 27, 2012 (accessed online).\n208 “Good theories”: Marvin Minsky, The Society of Mind (New York: Simon &\nSchuster, 1986)\n209 ”In a distributed system”: Leslie Lamport, “Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of\nEvents in a Distributed System”, Communications of the ACM, July 1978, 558\n143\nunimaginably fast. No one had ever heard of the Syrian Electronic Army a year\nbefore they were hijacking famous websites, injecting world-class malicious code\ninto opposition computers and demonstrating a digital attack fluency. 210 Of course\nthe charming side of such a shift is evident too: Walk the Vatican with an historian in\nyour ear, master sourdough in a weekend. There’s something not a little miraculous\nin the way the networked tools to recombine DNA or hack computer code or design\nviral software are getting both more sophisticated and simpler. If earlier eras put\nepoch-making implements into human hands – the knife! the train! – our age is now\nplacing new, mind-shaping forces within instant reach.\nIn a networked world, economic or military power doesn’t come just from\ncontrolling territory or information alone. It comes, more and more, from this\nmatery of the temporal. Securing territory today does not, alone, solve many\nproblems of safety. Control of information, of topologies and finally of time – this is\nwhat matters most. Such temporal security will be elusive; always in need of\ndefense. The arrival of airpower in World War Two, for instance, shifted battles\nfrom two to three dimensions. “Only large states are able to resist three-dimensional\nenvelopment,” the historian Nicholas Spykman wrote in 1942. 211 Even today, “Air\nSuperiority” is the precondition of nearly any American war. If we can dominate you\nfrom above, nearly anything seems possible. But networks add a fourth dimension.\n“Time Superiority.” Can you move faster than your enemy? Can you bog them down?\nOr are you a victim of fourth-dimensional envelopment. Control of time – yours,\nyour enemies – this will decide your strength.\n6.\nBack in the fall of 1988, at about the same moment that Danny Hillis and his team\nwere busy peddling their amazing Connection Machine – and trying to smash every\nworld computing speed record they could find – another device appeared in the\nworld of massively parallel super computers. It was, everyone who saw it agreed, an\nextremely strange machine. It’s appearance was completely unexpected. It’s\ndesigner was not a famous thinker about parallelism, cavorting with TV network\nfounders and physics Nobelists. In fact, its very success emerged from this strange\nface: The creator knew basically nothing about the sort of parallel design that\ninformed Hillis’ thinking. Which was strange, because it was far more “parallel” than\nthe Connection Machine could ever be. It was also cheaper. Simpler. And: It was\nfaster. In fact, it was the fastest parallel machine in history.\nThe machine began, quietly enough, in the mind of a 28-year old Cornell graduate\nstudent named Robert Tappan Morris. Morris came by his computer chops honestly\nenough: He was the son of Robert Morris Sr., the legendary NSA scientist we\nencountered several chapters ago, the man who penned those partly amusing, partly\n210 No one had heard: Edwin Grohe, “The Cyber Dimensions of the Syrian Civil War:\nImplications for Future Conflict”, Comparative Strategy (2015), 34:2,\n211 The arrival of airpower: Nicholas John Spykman, “Frontiers, Security and\nInternational Organization,” Geographical Review, Vol 32, No 3 (July 1942) p. 439\n144\nterrifying Golden Rules of Computer Security.“Rule One: Don’t Own A Computer.” The\nmachine that Morris Jr. created was madeentirely of software. It took the form of a\ncompact, simply designed computer program he’d written and designed to spread\nquickly and easily on the young systems of the Internet. It ran a mere 99 lines, took\nmost computers nanoseconds to execute and it worked like this: The program – it\nlater became known as a “worm” by the police who would come to find and arrest\nMorris Jr. – would find an open door on a network-connected computer. (In 1988,\nthe pre-Warez Dude era, finding such doors was not difficult. Finding locked doors\nwas probably harder.) Once Morris’ program had slithered inside and loaded itself\nonto the machine, like a dog slipping through an unattended puppy door, it would\nsniff around, rattle a few more doors to find any passwords that had been left\nunsecured. Then it would move on to the next machine. Knock, knock. Rattle, rattle.\nNext machine. Morris designed his code to simply repeat this process over and over.\nFilling, as a result, each machine’s memory with multiple, peformance-deadening\ncopies of the same program. A house full of puppies, in a sense. After several hours\nof this flu-like spread, a wave of unplanned, unending computation began choking\nthe net.\nMorris later explained he’d only meant his program as a demonstration, as a test of\nsorts. He wanted to show how machines might be made more safe. But he seemed to\ngrasp, almost immediately, that he’d made a mistake and that the worm was\nrunning away from him. He emailed a friend: How the hell to stop it? His friend had\nno idea either. They scrambled at least to warn system administrators about the\ndangerous code that would shortly devour their machines. “There may be a virus\nloose on the Internet,” they wrote. But that note, in a bit of bad luck, was\nquarantined inside a Harvard computer that had already been unplugged. So, a few\nhours after Morris released his code, unwarned and unprepared, the Internet froze.\n212 On November 2 nd and 3rd, 1988 machines around the world were shut off, cables\nwere pulled out of walls, and systems were wiped and restarted in a race to stop the\nrobot-like spread of the disease and then to finally kill it off. 213\nThe Morris Worm was, on those fall 1988 days, acting out a sober-minded insight of\nthe famed biological historian Alfred Crosby: “The nineteenth century was followed\nby the twentieth century, which was followed by the…nineteenth century.” 214\nCrosby meant that our age of topological connection meant we were back, again, in\nan age of infections. And this was true: Morris program was mapping out, like an\nepidemic, new routes in the age of high-speed digital contagion. But – and this is\nwhy we care about it here – by the time it reached “peak infection”, the worm was\n212 So, a few hours: David Moore, Colleen Shannon, k claffy, “Code-Red: a case study\nof the spread of a worm on the Internet” IMW '02 Proceedings of the 2nd ACM\nSIGCOMM Workshop on Internet measurment (2002), 273-284\n213 Morris later explained: Ted Eisenberg, DavidGries, Juris Hartmanis, Don\nHolcomb, and M. Stuart Lynn, Thomas Santoro, “The Cornell Commission: On Morris\nand the Worm”, Communications of the ACM (June 1989, 12: 9) 706\n214 The Morris program: Alfred W. Crosby, America's Forgotten Pandemic: The\nInfluenza of 1918 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003) xii\n145\nalso doing something else. It had infected tens of thousands of machines, which\nwere all cranking away in unintended harmony. During the 48 hours of its brief and\nunforgettable life, it was later calculated, the Morris Worm had become the most\npowerful parallel computer in history. At its peak, it managed to achieve a\nprocessing speed of 400 billion operations per second – about twice the speed of the\nmost expensive supercomputers of the day.\nLike any unexpected epidemic, the worm became a social, cultural and technological\nmilestone. First, it caused Morris to be arrested. He was handed a $10,000 fine,\nsome community service and several years of probation. He later went on to found\nan important Internet company, to join the faculty of MIT and to receive the highest\nhonors in computing for his (other) efforts.\nThen, a year or so after the virus had been finally corralled, the computer scientist\nFred Cohen, one of the earliest specialists in malware – in fact, the man who\ninvented the term “computer virus” – wrote an article that challenged the notion\nthat all computer viruses are, inherently, bad. 215 What drew his attention was that\nfabulous, unbelievable record of the Morris Worm: 400 billion computations each\nsecond. “The features that make computer viruses a serious threat to computer\nintegrity,” he wrote, “can also make them a powerful mechanism.” 216 This optimistic\ngloss, which sounded an awful lot like “The Plauge was great for humanity!” if you\ndidn’t follow Cohen’s logic, triggered a furious response. Eugene Spafford, also a\nwell-regarded computer researcher, fired back: “For someone of Dr. Cohen’s\nreputation to actually promote the uncontrolled writing of any virus, even with his\nstated stipulations, is to act irresponsibly and immorally.” 217\nSo here, then, is a line, of sorts. The Morris Worm, an expression of really massive\nconnection and interaction and speed, is a model for the world we live in now. Fast,\nlinking with a mind of its own, running best (or at least fastest) when it uses the\ndesign of the system to spread on a topology optimized for speed. But who is right\nabout the implication of such an historic design. Cohen? Spafford? Do we want our\nwhole world cranking away, super fast, compressing time to nothing?\nWe can, all of us, decide to fight against the very ideas of a network. Or we can, like\nCohen suggested, look at the terrifyingly fast nature of this world and begin to see\nsomething else. The totally unimaginable. Of course Spafford was not wrong. There\nis something scary and thought-muddling about the idea of intentionally authored\ncomputer viruses, running wild, ever faster. But there is something thoughtmuddling\nabout this whole world we’re entering. Networks are pulling at every\nexisting structure. They hum, really, with the most elemental and precious human\n215 Fred Cohen: Frederick B. Cohen. A Short Course on Computer Viruses (Pittsburgh,\nPA: ASP Press, 1990)\n216 “The features”: Fred Cohen, “Friendly Contagion: Harnessing the Power of\nComputer Viruses”, The Sciences Sept/Oct 199, 22\n217 Eugene Spafford: Eugene Spafford, “Three Letters on Computer Security and\nSociety,” Purdue e-Pubs 1991, 91-088\n146\ndata – our DNA, our wedding photos, our hopeful voice mails and most essential\nknowledge, our small savings against disaster. In its speed and its depth, in its\nincreasingly comprehensive grasp of each of us and our world, this new network\norder is at once the most amazing thing we’ve ever created and the most terrifying.\nBut recall, for a moment, Hillis’s dream for his parallel computer: “The ability to\nconfigure the topology of the machine to match the topology of the problem.” What\nif we really could rewire our thinking, our networks and politics and economics to\nmatch the problems we face now? Finally, with the Seventh Sense kicking alive in\neach of us, we can at least see the topological landscape where such a construction\nmight occur. Now we must turn to the exciting question of just how we’d configure it\nto do our bidding.\nWe’ve covered a lot so far; perhaps it is worth a glance back.\nFirst, we’ve come to see how networks really operate, the way in which they breed a\nlively connected skein that concentrates and distributes power. These systems are,\nas a result of their very design, plucking apart many of our old structures and ideas.\nRecall my dad, the doctor, ripped one direction by millions of disease advice\nwebsites (distribution) and in the other by massive diagnostic databases\n(concentration). This pulling process creates too, as we saw: Billion-user firms (and\nbillion dollar fortunes) bred with breathtaking speed. Drones, derivatives, waves of\nmigrants torn from their states but plugged into technological tapestries – all of\nthese are products of network power. Connection, we learned, changes the nature of\nany object. You. Me. Money. Terrorists. Pretty much anything. And because there is a\nlot more of the world that has not yet been fully connected, it’s easy to see that we\nlive in a revolutionary age.\nSecond, we learned that the world of networks is complex. It’s made up of many\ncomplicated pieces, but complexity is something entirely different: It’s the\nunpredictable and colliding evolution you might see in a rainforest, where\nuncountable forces intermingle to produce life and death, growth and change.\nScientists call this “emergence” – and it is happening on all our connected systems.\nConnection produces new, ripplingly powerful and unpredictable structures. The\nArab Spring. The 2008 financial crisis. Connection changes complicated objects not\nleast by making them complex. This is why our whole world, even the parts we\nmight expect to be most stable, whips around now with a new and wild energy. In a\nway, we saw, this should reward a careful confidence: Go ahead and break the old\nsystems. Something new will emerge.\nThird, we followed the trail of hackers like the Warez Dudes and discovered\nsomething unnerving about the networks around us. Not only are they\nhoneycombed with dangerous and unpatchable holes, but historically unmatched\namounts of power rests in their central cores. The reason hackers are so eager to get\nto these kernels of power is that in doing so they can manipulate entire landscapes\nof power with a profound efficiency. A “weird machine,” fired with an invisible and\ndangerous hacked logic, is a possibility that flutters through any network. Trade.\nPolitics. Finance. Choices made in the center of network systems will redound on\n147\neach of us. This is why we say that if in the past the most important things happened\nin public – wars, riots, and elections – in the future many of the most powerful shifts\nwill, rather worryingly, occur in secret.\nFourth, we met the New Caste that masters many of these hot cores of power, for\ngood and ill. Past eras were dominated by merchants, sages and soldiers who\ncompeted and collaborated in the pursuit of power. Now a new, young technological\ngroup is appearing. The nations and companies that train and equip them best of\nthem will have an incalculable advantage. But there’s a hitch: As much as this group\nknows about networks, they know little about history or politics or economics.\nDangerously, they often see the world as a machine to be coded.\nFifth, we unearthed a new and invisible set of landscapes that will decide much of\nour future. These are called “topologies” and they are the connected fields on which\npower moves now. The web where stocks are traded, cyber attacks occur, imports\nare moved, or biological data are recorded and studied – each of these is a crucial\ntopology. Control of them will be as important in the future as control of sea or air\nor capital once was.\nAnd, finally, we learned what the networks are for: The compression of time. For all\ntheir technical magnificence, we find that beating in the cold technological heart of\nthese systems is a most human desires, to negotiate a bit the one really inarguable\nconstant of our lives: We are all burning candles. The compression of time is why we\nconnect. It lets us do more, experience differently, live longer. What the demand for\nliberty was to the Enlightenment, the call to compress time will be in our future – a\nfundamental political demand. None of our existing institutions have been built to\nanswer this cry.\nThese six elements make up a rough outline of a new sensibility. To see them at\nwork in the world is the mark of a powerful way of thinking and feeling. The\nSeventh Sense. And this is important, we saw, because the shift ahead of us really is\nlike the Enlightenment in its scale. It will tip everything over. It can’t be totally\nunderstood in advance. We can see now that our old institutions are failing. Their\nstrategies for solving problems only makes them worse. We saw how, at that level of\nwar and peace, old ideas are laying new traps. No one in power seems to have a\nclear, convincing picture of just what is going on. We can feel the danger we face,\nlike rippling heat from a nearby inferno – our world tugged into the future by a class\nof old leaders who don't understand networks and a collection of new technologists\nwho don’t understand the world. We had better find some way forward that does\nnot depend entirely on either of these groups. The first may destroy our liberty in\nthe name of an elusive security; the other will consume our freedom in pursuit of a\nmad efficiency. And there’s one last thing we didn’t really learn here, but I think you\nprobably suspected it even before you started reading many chapters ago and met\nMaster Nan and his warning of impending “spiritual illness”: If we’re going to shape\nthis world at all, we don’t have much time.\n148\nPart Three:\nGateland\n149\nChapter Nine\nInside and Out\nIn which the Seventh Sense brings us face to face with the most powerful feature of our\nage – and perhaps of any age.\n1.\nThe Shangani River runs in a small, green vale through some of Southern Africa’s\nmost remarkable nature. It marked, a bit more than a century ago, the northernmost\nline of the British presence in Africa. If other parts of Queen Victoria’s colonial\nempire crackled with desert harshness, the mountains and hills rolling up from the\nCape and down to the Shangani were notable for a pleasing softness, a shading\ntowards pastels in the changeable light of the region. For London’s colonial\nmapmakers, South Africa was a long-eyed treasure, an ideal restocking and transfer\npoint for British ships headed for Lombok, Calcutta, Pondicherry and beyond. “We\nhave lost America,” the explorer William Dalrymple wrote Prime Minister William\nPitt in 1785. “An halfway house would secure us India, and an Empire to Britain.” 218\nThe African Cape would be that halfway house.\nFollowing the 1814 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, which gave the British control of the Cape,\nthe English pressed into Africa and found each newly opened district delivered\nmore wealth than the last. A colonialist’s dream: Diamonds. Gold. Endless fertile\nfields. The efficient engines of industry and exploration (and exploitation) of the\nBritish African Company chewed easily, profitably, into the land. “Having read the\nhistories of other countries, I saw that expansion was everything,” the mining baron\nCecil Rhodes wrote in 1875. “The world's surface being limited, the great object of\npresent humanity should be to take as much of the world as it possibly could.” 219\nAnd so the British did.\nIf there was a moment that showed the tenor, the power of this ruthless asymmetry\nmost clearly, it was the battle that exploded along the Shangani in 1893. The\nMatabele, a powerful local tribe had been smash-and-run fighting the colonists for\nyears. The British had tried to charm, pacify and bribe the Matabele and their Chief\nLobengula with money and land. None of it worked. They tried threats. That did not\nwork either. “The Chief has had all your messages,” an imperial adjutant reported\nback to Cape Town after another frustrating, pointless discussion in late 1892. “But\nhe has the art, not unknown to civilized despots, of ignoring what is not\nconvenient.” 220 Or perhaps the instinct of knowing what to avoid. One Boer\n218 “We have lost America”: David Johnson, Imagining the Cape Colony: History,\nLiterature, and the South African Nation (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press,\n2012), 67\n219 “The world’s surface being limited”: F. Vershcoyle Cecil Rhodes: His Political\nLife and Speeches, 1881-1900 (London: Chapman and Hall, 1900) 7\n220 “The Chief has had”: Copies and extracts of further correspondence relating to\nAffairs in Mashonaland, Matabeleand, and the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Nov 1893,\n150\ncommander, a blood enemy of Rhodes, had warned Lobengula: “When an\nEnglishman once has your property in his hands, then he is like a monkey that has\nits hands full of pumpkin seeds – if you don’t beat him to death, then he will never\nlet go.” 221\nSo when, in October of 1893, the British finally tracked Lobengula down to the\nbanks of the Shangani, the two sides faced off for what promised to be an intense,\ndecisive battle. “It was just after 2:15a.m., a peaceful night, clear sky but on the dark\nside,” one of the British infantrymen later recalled. “The bugles gave the alarm, the\ncamp was all excitement in a moment, all noise with the opening of ammunition\nboxes and shouting of officers, the men were getting into their places. There was a\ndin outside from the on-rushing Matebele impis that had decided to attack in the\nusual Zulu fashion.” The British soldiers were outnumbered. They were thousands\nof miles from home, hanging on the thin end of a 5,000 mile supply line. The\nMatabele knew the territory. They were fighting for the lives and families and honor.\nBut one sound was the decisive noise of the scale tipping towards the British\nsoldiers. A hushed clicking against the yelling all around. The opening of ammunition\nboxes. The British, for the first time in African action, had mounted machine guns.\nThe weapons worked that morning on the Shanghani with a violence you and I\nwould have expected. They reversed, more or less instantly, the Matabele\nadvantages of men, familiarity, and even furor. Machine-gunned Matabele were\nfound, in the hours after the attack, perched in trees, dug into dirt mounds and piled\ndesperately atop each other, killed as they had scrambled. One British soldier wrote\nlater that that the weapons had mowed down the Matabele “like grass.” Lobengula\nsurvived, but his army was massacred down to a squad and he was reduced to\npleading. “Your Majesty,” he wrote to Queen Victoria in the days after the battle,\n“what I want to know from you is: Why do your people kill me?” 222 With this\nmissive, the Chief entered the ranks of the Queen’s powerless correspondents, onceomniscient\nfeeling men in Africa or Asia or India who wrote her after some\ndevastating battlefield reverse – baffled, confused, overwhelmed. Did she even read\nthe letters? It was hard to know, but that only made the pleading more perversely\nimbalanced. The locals had no idea, really, what they were up against.\nMartial leverage. It was the inarguable force of the 19 th Century. It made Europe’s\ncolonial masters. Of course they lied, stole, fought – did whatever sensible and\nsleazy thing Cecil Rhodes and his ilk suggested was needed. The monkey with the\npumpkin seeds. Expansion was everything. Imperial dreamers in London, Berlin,\nBrussels, Vienna and Paris saw with total clarity the immense historical imbalance\nacross the chasm of industry and science and reason. The “Convergence Club”\nHer Majesty's Stationery Office, Telegram from Assistant Commisioner, Palapye, to\nhis Excellency High Commissioner, Cape Town, p 13.\n221 “When an Englishman”: Vershcoyle, p 191-192\n222 “Your majesty”: Report, Report, Volume 61 Sessional papers, (London:\nCommonwealth Shipping Committee, H.M. Stationery Office, 1893), 77 from\nUniversity of Michigan online digitized library\n151\nagainst the divergent, the left-behind. Rhodes confessed ambition for his company\nto “take as much of the world as it possibly could,” was simply an armed, greedy\nversion of Kant’s “Dare to Know”. Just as no question was was unaskable, no place\nwas too far off to possess or exploit. No position was secured by history or distance\nor sentiment. This was, for instance, the lesson taught to Lin Zexu, the Qing Dynasty\nbureaucrat sent out from Beijing in 1839 to stop the British opium sales that were\nreducing China to a drugged, useless coma. “Suppose there were people from\nanother country who carried opium for sale to England and seduced your people\ninto buying and smoking it?” Lin wrote the Queen. “Certainly your honorable ruler\nwould deeply hate it and be bitterly aroused?” Lin thought that he was speaking as\nthe voice of a great, eternal empire. Victoria never replied. To the extent Victoria\nwas aroused by anything in Southern China, it was likely by the way in which, a few\nmonths after Lin’s letter, the British emasculated the Qing military and moved into\nHong Kong for a 150-year stay.\n“Whatever happens,” the Hilaire Belloc had his Colonial character Captain Blood\nfamously quip in an 1885 poem, “we have got the Maxim and they ‘ave not.” 224 The\nmachine guns were a totem of dominance in Shangani and on other colonial front\nlines; they marked a gulf between modern and unmodern, between industrial and\nagricultural. The weapons had first appeared in the mid-1800s on battlefields in the\nAmerican Civil War, after the inventor Richard Gatling sent a package of samples to\nthe White House and convinced President Lincoln – a famous gadget freak – that\ntheir firepower might bring the Civil War to a faster close. Lincoln ordered the Army\nto try the guns, but Gatling’s early attempts were honestly too immature to tell\ndecisively on the battlefields of the American south. Within a few decades, however,\nthe guns were perfected in places like Africa, or on the frontlines of the 1904 Russo-\nJapanese War. They represented a compelling, inarguable logic of industrial war: A\nmachine and a gun. We mowed them down like grass. You could read that line as\nmetaphor: Mowing grass was, in the end, the act of a machine killing a wild, natural\nworld into a clean, useful order. The Europeans were the grass-clipping machine;\nthe rest of the world was, well, the grass. For a colonial temperament hardened for\n“The Great Game” of empire on the playing fields of Eton, preparing a lawn for\ntennis and a territory for exploitation were not particularly distinct acts.\nThe Shangani battle gunshots struck the European mind as powerful confirmation of\neverything they suspected about the magic violence of an industrial age. The image\nof such a device suited the aggressive, engineering-led mood of era. As Gatling – and\nhis competitor Hiram Maxim – peddled the guns, they faced a predictable resistance,\nof course: Europe’s cavalry officers were in love with their well-bred horses. But the\nage was, finally, the story of aggressive industry flattening old habits. Trains were\nassaulting the countryside. Factories were pounding apart the habits of labor. Social\nstampedes of speed-climbing nouveau riche, political attacks of new industrial\nunions and counter attacks all expressed this aggressive energy. The soundtrack of\nGermany in the decades after 1869, as Bismarck stitched together a new nation\n224 “Whatever happens”: Hilaire Belloc, The Modern Traveler, (London: Edward\nArnold, 1898)\n152\nfrom dozens of hereditary principalities, was the ceaseless ping-ping of rail-building\nand welding and industry. How natural it must have seemed to add the rat-a-tat-tat\nof a Maxim gun. Crown Prince Wilhelm, the Kaiser’s eldest son, wrote that defensive\nthinking was, “utterly foreign to the German spirit.” Bismarck’s “Iron and Blood”\nnational motto became, finally, personal for many Germans, who were prouder to\nleave their universities with a hot-red dueling scar on their faces than a subtle\nownership of Goethe in their hearts.\n“During the decades before the First World War,” the political scientist Steven van\nEvera has observed, “a phenomenon which may be called a ‘cult of the offensive’\nswept through Europe.” 225 Wars, it was believed, would run with the same swiftness\nof trains or the new industrial sewing machines or steam-fired printing presses. It\nwas this instinct that led German generals to assure the Kaiser in 1914 that a war\nbegun in August would be finished by Christmas. English university students\nsprinted to enlistment centers in the days after the war began, worried the fight\nmight end before they tasted blood. French farmers moving from their crops to the\ntrench lines of Flanders, Russian aristocracy crowding towards the Danube, the\npoliticians who led them all – they operated, mostly, with this same conviction.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey’s mournful meditation on the evening of\nAugust 3,1914, the first night of the war, was a lonely one: “The lamps are going out\nall over Europe,” he said. “We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.”\nThe First World War was a kind of engineering tragedy. The disaster had deep roots:\ndomestic politics, the insecurity of kings, profound colonial greed. But also a\nfundamental miscalculation about the nature of war and peace in an age of industry.\nMachine guns – and all the tools of industrial war, from gas to battleships – were not\nmagic tricks of fast victory or permanent peace, as some had thought. A mechanized\nmodern army wasn’t, as much as it may have seemed in theory or drills or in\nmidnight massacres in the African bush, some steam-press built for cold rolling the\narmies Belgium and Prussia and France. In fact, the weapons encouraged battle as\nthey piled endlessly in national arsenals. They tickled fears of fast or surprise attack,\neven as they gratified that weird continental hunger for violence. Hilare Beloc’s\npoetic joke, the sly we’ve got the Maxim, and they’ve not took on an unexpected\ncharacter when both sides had ‘em. The machine gun reached the fiery acme of its\npurpose not as a spur to end wars altogether, as Gatling once hoped, but rather\nwhen it was married to barbed wire, to shovels and to gas – and then admixed with\nthe trigger-tugging fear of 20-year-old boys. So: Sixty thousand British casualties in\none day alone, July 1, 1916 at the Somme.\nThe rhymes changed. Hilare Beloc’s jigs were a distant memory for the starved,\nsurprised and shocked men in the field. Siegfried Sassoon:\nYou smug faced crowds, with kindling eye\nWho cheer when soldier lads march by,\n225 “During the decades”: Steven Van Evera, “Cult of the Offensive and the Origins\nof the First World War”, International Security (Vol 9, No 1, Summer 1984) 58\n153\nSneak home and pray you’ll never know\nThe hell where youth and laughter go. 226\nAs soldiers dug into trenches that would endure for a half-decade, a terrible\nstrategic fact dawned on the generals who led Europe’s armies. The Great War was\ngoing to be a charnel house. The continent had built itself into a battle machine,\nwired by trains and telegraphs and armies. There was no reverse gear. There was\nnot even a switch to slow it down, let alone turn it off. A massive, technologypowered,\nfast-moving system with revolutionary implications, built beyond the\ncomprehension of any one figure or nation, had slipped out of control. And the men\nin charge of planning and directing the use of this super-fast complex? They failed\neveryone: their soldiers, their kings, their armies. They were all but insensible to the\nreal nature of their age.\nSound familiar?\n2.\nHere, then, is a question of the sort – violent, loaded with the possibility of tragedy –\nthat you’d rather not have to consider: A new way of war arrives, a new weapon, a\nfresh idea about fighting. Does it make your world peaceful or treacherous? The\nlethality of the equation of guns x machines at the end of the 19 th Century appeared\nto some industrialists and bankers and statesmen inarguable evidence for peace.\nEveryone with such a violently efficient weapon; who dares start a war? As we now\nknow, machines x guns was a formula for some of the worst killing in human history.\nGatling’s fond hope that his weapons would stop war was naïve, insane even. His\ncompetitor Maxim had been clearer eyed. A friend told him: “Give up your chemistry\nand electricity. If you want to make a pile of money, invent something that will\nenable those Europeans to cut each others' throats with greater facility.” 227\nSo: Let’s be a bit warmer about this. Networks x weapons = what exactly? Is there\nsome disaster lingering in our own future, as unimagined from our current\nperspective as machine guns and trenches were a century ago? Do we consider war\nimpossible now? There’s something sickening in such puzzles, of course. Think of\nthe men and women who, over the millennia, have contemplated similar questions\nknowing full well the answer would be measured in blood and treasure and\nchildren. Put yourself in the place of the population of Melos, a peace-loving\nMediterranean island whose destruction 2300 years ago was chronicled by\nThucydides in The Peloponesian Wars. “Surely you have noticed that you are an\nisland and we control the ocean,” an unwelcome Athenian general intimated to a\nMelian citizens’ council one day 243 BC as his soldiers and ships collected\nmenacingly outside the city’s walls. Athens wanted the Melians to join an alliance\n226 “You smug faced”: Seigfried Sassoon, “Suicide in the Trenches” in The War\nPoems of Seigfried Sassoon, (Mineola, N.Y.: Dover Publications, 2004), 64\n227 “Give up your chemistry”: John Ellis, A Social History of the Machine Gun (New\nYork: Pantheon, 1975) p.33\n154\nagainst Sparta. The Melians – like poor Lin Zexu or Lobengula of the Matabele –\nyearned only to be left alone. “You would not agree to our being neutral, friends\ninstead of enemies, but allies of neither side?” they asked 228 . No, the Athenians\nreplied, and then a line that has resonated through the problems of nations ever\nsince: “It is the nature of power that he who has it takes; he who does not must\nsubmit.” The Melians voted stubbornly against surrender and for hope. Perhaps the\nSpartans would mount a relief raid? The Athenians might change their minds?\nNeither happened. The Melian men were betrayed and then massacred. Their wives\nand children were sold as slaves.\nWhat do networks do when they touch the balance of war and peace? How might we\nuse what we know, what we sense, about a connected age to manage the dangers\nahead? If an insane Cult of the Offensive flavored the end of the 19 th Century, our\nown age vibrates, as we’ve seen, to a Cult of the Disruptive. The great tale of our\ntimes is the diffusion of a new, promising and disorienting network order. We’ve\nbeen told that all this interconnection makes war an impossibility. Everyone would\nbe a loser in such a war. But the way in which that earlier age was so horribly wrong\nabout the result of machines x weapons, should unnerve us. We don’t yet really know\nwhat networks x weapons means – to say nothing of networks x networks x weapons.\nOr, to sum up what we’ve seen so far in this book, very fast networks x artificial\nintelligence x black boxes x a New Caste x compression of time x everyday objects x\nweapons.�Would you look at that weird formula and say conclusively: “Hey, we’ll all\nget along.” Me neither. We should worry about the day we might face a Melian\nchoice of our own, when some general or infomanagerial despot – or some clicking\ncomputer – shows up, unwelcome, and says to us: It should be obvious you are\nmerely a node, and I control the network.\nWhen leaders label the rise of China or cyberweapons or terrorism or the decline of\nthe US as the “main problem” of our age – and all of these have been designated as\nsuch by famous foreign policy figures –they are missing the revolutionary, uniting\nforce that animates them all. Networks. Whether we are trying to slice apart the\nroots of the Islamic State or slow Russian territorial dreams or understand narcoeconomics\nor hedge-fund finance – connectivity touches and defines each problem.\nNew and essential platforms for finance and biological data and artificial intelligence\nare emerging now, blossomed out of network connection. These ecosystems must be\ndesign, built, protected. All while the world we know kicks back around us,\nsometimes crumbling, sometimes fighting for its dear life. I promised earlier that\nwe’d apply the Seventh Sense to some practical problem, and the deadly test of war\nand peace is the one I’d like to consider now. The sharpest challenge of truth for any\nview of the world is, after all, the design of a grand strategy. Get it right and you can\nsecure your safety. The energy of the age can be your tool. Get it wrong and you reap\nthe Somme, Melos, Canton, the Shangani. Recall General Liu Yazhou’s line: “A major\n228 The Melians: Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, Steven Lattimore trans.,\n(Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 1998) Chap 5.; See also the excellent BBC\nperformance of certain elements of Thucydides in “The War That Never Ends”\navailable on YouTube\n155\nstate can lose many battles, but the only loss that is always fatal is to be defeated in\nstrategy.”\nThe leaders of our major global powers may be as blind to the dangers and\npossibility of our world as Europe’s heads of states were to the nature of their era\n100 years ago. You know what the Seventh Sense is now. Who among them has it?\nWe should wonder if we’ve merely now done Hiram Maxim one better: Have we\ndeveloped something with our age of connection that will reach its fullest potential\nin allowing us to slit each other’s throats more efficiently? I don’t think so, but\nunderstanding why means we need consider the networks, to feel them out with our\nnew sense.\n3.\nThe essential problem of politics is not difficult to state. It was true for Seneca in the\nRoman Forum as it was for Lobengula on the Shangani riverbank or is now for\ncongressmen in Washington or cadres is Beijing: Who has power? Why? By power I\nmean the ability to control others, to tell them what to do – or what not to do; and of\ncourse to avoid being dictated to yourself in that “Surrender or die” way. Max\nWeber, the German sociologist of the last century, had it right: Macht, the ability to\nachieve what you want despite the resistance of others. 229 Don’t develop nuclear\nweapons. Or Don’t attack us. Or, Join our alliance against Sparta are all examples of\npower in action. The movement of power, from the balled-up fists of Kings and\nPopes and Emperors, to the hands of markets and voters and citizens, and now into\na fresh, connected dynamic is the story of history. This is a lurching, worrisome,\ndangerous process even if it suggests some miraculous transformations. Whole new\ntopologies of vital, life-giving control are emerging; surely contests for their mastery\nwill occur. The terrible human infection of a hunger for power and security isn’t,\nmuch as we might wish, something quarantined safely to the pages of Homer or\nHitler.\nSo let’s pass beyond describing the new and surprising elements that make up a\nSeventh Sense and onto its use. Examine our world with this instinct, for a moment.\nPicture that constantly stretched, complex network, spitting out drones, viruses,\nfortunes and disruption as it is wont to do. Recall the seething, insidious power of\nthe Warez Dudes, the New Caste, the black boxes they all hunger to penetrate and\nmake weird. Think of the compression of time, of twisting topologies that can place\nthe distant atop us in an instant. What single feature stands out? Our world shuffles\nnow, as all these forces slip into an order defined by closed spaces, by fresh in and\nout borders. What the Seventh Sense reveals as it feels at this new arrangement is\ngates. Everywhere. Facebook, bitcoin users, doctors with privileged access to\ngenetic databases – all are gated, in-or-out worlds. Look around and see how many\ngates enclose you or your family or your company. The Internet. The FTSE 100. Your\nApple or Android operating system. In our connected age, the act of drawing lines\n229 Max Weber: Max Weber and Sam Whimster, The Essential Weber: A Reader.\n(London: Routledge, 2004), 355\n156\nbetween points is also an act of drawing a line around those points. It is not simply\nthat we’re enmeshed in networks now; no, we’re enclosed even entrapped by them.\nIf the great ambition of Cecil Rhodes’ era was for the expansive conquest of\nterritory, in our own it is for the construction and manipulation of gated spaces.\nGatelands.\nIn an age of network power, no position is more important, formidable, influential\nor profitable than that of the gatekeeper. Defining who is in or out of any network is\namong the most essential moves of design. In financial markets, on the Internet\nbackbone or inside the human immune system, the accept-or-reject decision\ndetermines a great deal. The first sign of order breaking down, whether it is the\nRoman Empire or your lungs, is an inability to manage what slips in and out. Flows\nof bits, of migrants, of gold and patents and medicines – all of these life-giving forces\ncan be controlled, bent for good or stopped for ill, as they pass through or collide\nwith gates. By gates I mean not only in-out passages but all of the tools that meter\nand enclose the various Gatelands: Protocols, languages, block-chains. Whatever\nbinds and shapes an information topology. Any sort of code or encryption or binary\ninstruction that can unlock an in and out. If you want to make a fortune or a\nrevolution (or both), if you hope to shatter some barrier of tools or ideas between\nyou and a dream, or to lead a religious revival, spread an infection of hate or\nrevolution or insidious Morris-style computer code – then fundamentally this is\nwhat you have to consider: Where are the gates? How to smash them? How to build\nyour own? We are entering, as a result of our dependence on networks of all sorts, a\nlandscape where the very clustering of power creates new border regions, bridges\nand gates. If older, hierarchical systems craved a top – a king, a superpower, a Pope\n– our connected, meshlike age demands valves and protocols and gates. It hungers\nfor connection, which means it hungers too for throttles and accelerators and\nbrakes. And of course people to run them. To speed them up. Slow them. Finger off\nswitches. This reordering of power will produce, is producing, a fight over\ntopological spaces for finance, biology, trade or pretty much any source of power.\nThe scramble is as urgent, decisive and essential as the one Rhodes and his peers\nembarked upon. Inside or out? A fresh Meliananxiety haunts us: Are you the\ngatekeeper? Or the gatekept?\nWe wander into Gateland the moment we switch our phones on. We enter it when\nwe book an airline ticket, when our genetics folds into a pool of data, or when we\ntake a new degree, master a computer language, or check on friends via one stateful\nconnected platform or another. We enter it, in short, when we connect. Gatekeepers\nchoose what we see. They determine the rules we follow, what we can and can’t\nchange. They reward us too – once we’re inside – with benefits of speed, knowledge\nand safety. Gatekeepers, which can be people or protocols or code, decide who can\njoin closed communities and who is left out and why. They pass us the fine benefit of\nthe compression of time, even as they expose us to the zipper of instant potential\ndisaster hitting everyone in a closed space at once. Gatekeepers control, for instance,\nhow (and how fast) financial data moves between members of light-speed “in the\nknow” trading pools, and the suckers outside. What you can see in your phone or\nyour university computer, why, how – all of these choices have to be made by\n157\ngatekeepers. They can, if they wish, manipulate any step of life inside their enclosed\norbs of power – and by extension, they can twist data and machines and you. The\nline between perverting search results and election results is a thin one. Such a\nmanipulation of data is trivial, which means the manipulation of you and I is,\ntechnically at least, trivial. It involves the laying of our preferences – what do we\nusually read, watch, who do we talk to, where do we live – against machine logic and\nvast data fields. Manipulation of data = Manipulation of us.\nThe idea of gatekeeping first emerged as it related to newspapers, back in the 1920s\nwhen politicians, advertisers and a few social scientists watched a print-information\nexplosion – and developed an uneasy feeling about how the world looked through\nmany newspapers. The personal whims of an editor, his political bent, his boss’\neconomic interest – all of these laid on “facts” like a heavy distorting blanket. Minor\ntwitches were turned into fear-mongering bait. Major global shifts were ignored.\nThe papers are (nearly) gone now, of course. And the idea of gatekeepers merely\nbending headlines to suit a personal whim seems charmingly nostalgic. Gatekeepers\ntoday have a far more profound, subtle reach. They might be governments or\nregulators or CEOs or machines or research committees, each controlling the design\nand development of some “rich get richer” tool we depend on and – by marking that\n“in or out” line – exerting historic, invisible control. Genetic engineering secrets.\nUnthrottled data flows. Product releases. Do you want accurate DNA analysis? Fast\nprotection from epidemic? A cyber-defense system? You can’t have any of these, you\nknow, unless you’re in someone’s fiercely guarded gateland. Even systems that look\nopen – the Internet, the world of US Dollar transactions, the election rolls – are\ngated in certain ways. Of course there is – at times – a balance between the\ngatekeepers and the gatekept, between those of us inside a system and the tools and\npeople who overmaster us. “In many cases, traditional literature focuses mainly on\ngatekeepers as elites who hold power in their hands while the gated are treated as\npowerless,” the information theorist Karine Nahon has written. “In networks,\nhowever, it is necessary to give sufficient weight to the role of the gated, since being\nsubject to gatekeeping does not imply that the gated are powerless, lack\nalternatives, or that gatekeeping is forced on them. Actually, being a gated\nsometimes is a matter of choice.” 230 But sometimes, of course, it is also a matter of\ninarguable necessity.\nIn the slower, less wired worlds of our past, gates mattered too of course. Nations,\ngovernments, militaries, religious orders – all of these clustered behind (and\ndefended) marked lines. Map lines, front lines, dogmatic lines. The Triple Entente\nthat bound Britain, France and Russia together in the last century was as much a\ngated system for their own security as the Peloponnesian League 2500 years earlier\nhad been. Deciding who could swap silk for spice beyond the Tang Dynasty’s border\nwas a gatekeeping choice, as consequential for Chinese strategists of the 8 th Century\nas the decision about what might or might not be wheeled into the city was for the\n230 “In many cases”: Karine Barzilai-Nahon, “Toward a theory of network\ngatekeeping: A framework for exploring information control.” Journal of the America\nSociety for Information Science 59(9), 1493–1512.\n158\ntragically uncareful councils of Troy. But now, in an age where connection decides\nso much, control over gates has a unique leverage. When you finally can feel out the\ntopology of our age, when in anger or frustration or hope or wonder you are ready\nto act, then this is among the first questions you have to ask. I’m on the topology now,\nwhere are the gates.\n4.\nGates in an age of instant, everywhere, smart networks are, you can imagine,\ndifferent from the ones that girded Troy or the Tang dynasty. It’s not merely that\nthey’re made of bits and algorithms not bricks, it’s that the underlying nature of\ntheir power is different. The most visible evidence of this distinction was first\nobserved by economists a couple of decades ago, as they contemplated the fortunes\nof the information age, wealth that had been assembled at an eye-watering pace.\nUnlike traditional businesses which turned over time into competitive slugfests with\nvery low profits, many high-tech firms seemed to run with a new, nearly inverted\nlogic. “Our understanding of how markets and businesses operate was passed down\nto us more than a century ago by figures such as Alfred Marshall,” the economist\nBrian Arthur wrote in the Harvard Business Review in the summer of 1996. “It is an\nunderstanding based squarely upon the assumption of diminishing returns:\nproducts or companies that get ahead in a market eventually run into\nlimitations.” 231 Marshall had been the first to name this phenomenon in the 1890s:\n“Diminishing Returns”. As any line of business gets more competitive, the profits –\nor “returns” to investment – shrink. Henry Ford invents a car, he has no competition\nat first and fairly prints money. But Ford doesn’t enjoy his monopoly for long. Pretty\nsoon the Dodge brothers follow him into business, as does Walter Chrysler and then\na cascade of new auto companies. They all take a piece of the pie; profits for every\ncarmaking firm diminish. Then the Japanese pile in. The Koreans show up. These\nnew companies compete with growing intensity. Marginal profits decline for\neveryone. Then the Chinese. And the Indians.\nAs he studied the balance sheets of infotech firms, Arthur noticed something\nstrange: Returns were increasing over time. As their markets matured some\ncompanies made more marginal money with each passing day, not less. Marshall’s\n19 th Century industrial economics had never contemplated such a lucrative\narrangement. “Increasing returns,” Arthur explained, “are the tendency for that\nwhich is ahead to get farther ahead. They are mechanisms of positive feedback that\noperate—within markets, businesses, and industries—to reinforce that which gains\nsuccess or aggravate that which suffers loss.” In other words: Winner takes all. No\nsecond place. Arthur was thinking, as he wrote, about the then-nascent computer\nsoftware business. Say for instance, Arthur sent you a copy of his paper to read\nbefore publication as a Microsoft Word document. Well, if you wanted to see what\nhe had to say, you’d pretty much have to own a copy of Word yourself. If you then\n231 As he studied: Brian Arthur, “Increasing Returns and the World of Business”\nHarvard Business Review (1996)\n159\nsent it along to some friends for their input, they’d be in the same bind. One after\nanother, in just this fashion, users tumbled into the program. It became a standard, a\n“platform” in industryspeak.\nAnd Microsoft enjoyed a particularly appealing economic leverage: Developing\nWord may have cost millions, but once that work was done, each additional copy\ncost just cents to produce. This astonishing speed loop of profitability demanded a\nwhole new economics. It also forced a reconsideration of what “competition” might\nreally mean. Once Excel or Windows had settled into place, had become a standard,\nyou couldn’t really compete with it. New, optimistic maybe even better rivals rushed\ninto the marketplace, but they were all assaulting the impregnable wall of habit, of a\nlocked-in technology. Should this be legal? Arthur wondered. Traditional economics\nsaid such monopolies were bad for everyone. (As did the Department of Justice and\ntheir global peers as they chased Microsoft for a decade.) But was that right? The\n“platform dividend” that accrued to Microsoft was surely large, but if you could\nsomehow total up the benefit to the rest of us? The convenience, the efficiency, the\nbenefits of Microsoft’s billions of research spending might dwarf even Redmond’s\nmassive profits. “Increasing returns,” Arthur wrote, “cause businesses to work\ndifferently and they stand many of our notions of how business operates on their\nhead.”\nThe essential phenomenon Arthur spotted at work two decades ago is something we\nnow know as “network effects” – an idea that changed how we think about\nbusinesses, and particularly about the sticky and alluring power of gated, connected\nsystems in nearly any setting. In the years after Arthur’s paper, billions of us ran\nmadly along a course he had anticipated: We crashed our way as fast as possible\ninto those single, winning businesses – rewarding them with near monopoly\npositions in exchange for the benefits of being “inside”. In the twenty years since\nArthur spotted increasing returns in software, eight different billion-user worlds\nhave emerged – and others are not far behind: Microsoft Office and Windows,\nGoogle Search, Google Maps, Facebook, Google Chrome, YouTube and Android all\nexhibit that appealing, “If you use it, I’ll use it!” logic. Profits and power, just as\nArthur would have expected, followed right along. The most valueable company on\nearth in the early age of connection was one that, particularly, had perfected the\nidea of a closed iWorld where the efficiencies and charm of inclusion made outside\nassault difficult. Younger companies like Instagram, WhatsApp, Weixin and others\nhover not far from a billion users and point us to this gated model spread and\nrepeated. It is easy enough to imagine a world where billions will be enmeshed\nbehind certain gates.\nIt was just as Arthur predicted: If ten people use WhatsApp or Facebook or\nYouTube, it’s hard for the eleventh to do something different. And when the\neleventh person joins in, they make it harder still for the twelfth to walk a unique\npath. So: Windows runs on 90% of the globe’s PCs, nearly 30 years after its first\nrelease. Google has 65% market share. Android runs on 81% of new phones.\nWhatsApp neared a billion users with less than 50 engineers on staff. Facebook\npassed a billion connected people and faced no real competition. The rich got richer.\n160\nHow? “Seven friends in ten days,” Facebook growth hackers repeated like a mantra\nin the early years, a humming meditation that carried them from dorm room to\nnearly every corned of the world 232 . If you or I joined the service and found seven\nfriends in ten days, we would most likely stay, enjoying the benefits of the gated\nworld, making it that much harder (impossible really) for friend number eight to\nwander somewhere else. Pretty soon, there was essentially nowhere else to go\nanyhow. The network magnetism worked so well that, as a result, Facebook’s speedlooping\nconnection machine cut the famous “six degrees of separation” posited by\nStanley Miligram – the number of leaps between any two people on the planet – to\nfour. 233\nNetwork theorists who came after Arthur call these “rich get richer” systems “power\nlaw distributed” because if you line up all the firms in a digital industry you find the\nwinners are exponentially – by a power of ten or one hundred – ahead of everyone\nelse. They slip free from the average gravitational center of a normal bell curve that\nmarks most traditional business. A normal distribution would shape up like a chart\nof people who own cars: 20 percent driving Fords, 10 percent Nissans and Toyotas,\nand so on. Or it might look like the distribution of height: Most men are between 5’7\nand 5’11, but 50% are scattershotted at different heights. Network systems,\nhowever, can breed commanding winners. It’s not like 50% of online users are on\nthe Internet and others are scattered across different systems. Users huddle into\nsingle winning clusters. It’s as if 90% of the world always bought a Ford; or 90% of\npeople were exactly 5’ 11”. These systems run faster and better and more profitably\nbecause they are locked-in, gated by technology standards and by common\nconnection. When we say that networks crave gates, this is the sort of gate we mean.\nIf you had to look for your friends one-by-one on Facebook, Friendster, MySpace,\nand GooglePlus you’d exhaust yourself. So, one winner emerges. Data scientists\nattribute the success of these winning nodes to “preferential attachment” – the idea\nthat if Brian Arthur is using Microsoft Word and I’m using it you are likely to do so\ntoo. But there’s another secret: More widespread adoption makes the whole system\nfaster. Winner-take-all marks that network hunger for the compression of time. 234\nThere’s an additional feature at work in the very newest of these billion-user\nclusters that’s worth our attention: It’s not merely that we’ll use them because\neveryone seems to be doing so, it’s also that as more users weave themselves into\neach others’ lives and the machines into too, these nodes of power get smarter.\nGoogle Maps can predict the fastest route from your house to your office because it\ncan watch the movements of hundreds of millions of users, each silently pinging\ntheir location and speed as they creep through rush hour or sprint down an empty\nmotorway. As more people use GPS enabled devices, the quality of this data gets\n232 The network magnetism: Chamath Palihapitiya, “How we put Facebook on the\npath to 1 billion users.” Udemy Growth Hacking: An Introduction lecture published\nJanuary 9, 2013 and available on YouTube.\n233 Winner-take-all: van der Hofstad, p 24\n234 But there’s another secret: Albert-Lazlo Barabási “Network Science”,\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: (2013) 371\n161\never better, like a video resolving itself from low-quality to HD in front of your eyes.\nSuccess attracts still more users. All of them are Google’s sensors, in a way. Medical\ndiagnosis, cybersecurity, trading algorithms, search – pretty much any linked ball of\nchips and humans and sensors throbs with this logic. The best of the leading\ntechnology firms understand the power of this logic: Google’s TensorFlow artificial\nintelligence engine, for instance, was largely regarded by experts as nearly a decde\nahead of competitors in 2015. So the company began giving away access for free. In\ntraditional economic terms this would be insane; but with network logic the\nstrategy is clear: The more people who use TensorFlow, the smarter it gets, which in\nturn attracts still more users. Dense and learning fusions of mind and data like\nTensorFlow and other soon-arriving AI systems are all gated universes. The\n“increasing returns” for those inside – you, me, our neighbors – breed mutual\nefficient success and, of course, massive power for their owners. We’re part of the\ngame too: The more people tied in, the better our lives get.\nThe topological charm of these explosively growing clusters was first teased apart\nby the electrical engineer Bob Metcalfe in the 1970s. Metcalfe was hunting for a\nbetter way to send data – say grocery lists to his wife – through Menlo Park and he\nperfected a connection protocol called Ethernet, which soon became a standard for\nlinking machines. What Metcalfe noticed, as more and more users piled into the\ngateland of Stanford’s Ethernet-connected machines, was that the power of the\nsystem was growing exponentially with each additional user. This became known\nlater as “Metcalfe’s Law”: The power of a network grows, massively, with each\nadditional user. A system with one phone, for example, is really not very useful. Who\nwould you call? A system with two phones means one possible connection – we can\ncall each other. But when you increase the number of phones by a factor of two –\nfrom five to ten, say – the number of possible connections more than doubles from\nten to 45 . The difference between Bob Metcalfe and his wife sharing grocery lists\nand a connected national network of husbands and wives is immense – an insight\nthat led Bob Metcalfe and his wife to start a networking company that made them\nbillionaires.\nMetcalfe’s Law has another angle, and it’s here where some of the unnerving,\ndangerous political power of network gates is revealed: It’s not merely that the\npower of a network grows exponentially with each additional user; it’s that the cost\nof being cut out grows every bit as fast. Maybe even faster. If I shut you out of Google\ntoday, it’s painful. But tomorrow – after a day of new information and websites and\nservices come on line – it will be even more costly. The network scientists Rahul\nTongia and Ernest Wilson have called this “The Flip Side of Metcalfe’s Law.” 235 To be\nexcluded from a database of cancer genetics, for instance, when it has a million\nmembers is probably not such a painful problem; to be locked out of the chance to\ncompare your genes with a billion others, however, is hugely costly. Maybe even\nfatal. Imagine if I cut you out tomorrow from the NYSE, your phone system, smart\ndiagnostic webs, cybersecurity patches? It’s not like you can swap our your Ford for\n235 The network scientists: Rahul Tongia and Ernest J. Wilson III, “The Flipside of\nMetcalfe’s Law”, International Journal of Communication 5 (2011), 665–681\n162\na Dodge. There is nowhere to go. Gatelands produce “winner take all” systems, but\nthey also produce these “loser gets nothing” dynamics – and an absolutely chilly,\nfatal cost of separation from the winning system. A discipline of network science\nknown as “queing theory” helps us understand why. In studies of massively\nconnected systems, the more time machines spend on their main task – hunting\nprime numbers or DNA patterns, for instance – and the less time chattering with\neach other about how they will compute, the faster they run. Winning protocols\navoid this terrible inefficiency of translation because it can be spread across so\nmuch connection. In fact, the great breakthrough of computer systems in recent\nyears has been the ability to handle massive amounts of data all at once, to maintain\nversions of information in a concurrent state many places in the world. This is the\nessential technical leap that permits compression of time. And it depends entirely on\ncareful and gated design.\nTo be inside a gated system is, then, really to be faster because of the slickness of\ncommunication that becomes possible. The very structure of the system accelerates\nthat compression of time. This design feature of networks, in which winners take\nmore and more, is why gates, and their careful use, will become the most dramatic\nlever for business, research or international politics in coming years. It also explains\nwhy our modern gates are different than older ones. Why it is so damn costly to\nleave them; why mastery of them is even more insanely lucrative than Cecil Rhodes’\ngold mines. Think of the old industrial age power games for a moment: Britain and\nGermany tried to match each other with their industrial output during their fatal\ncompetitive sprint 150 years ago; but imagine if network effects obtained? If\nBritain’s initial head start in the industrial revolution had given them 90% global\ntrade share? Germany would never have even tried to compete. They would have\nbeen the Friendster of the 20 th Century: Isolated, slow-growing, powerless and\nfinally consumed by the winning system.\n5.\nNetworks crave gates. Once a billion people were connected together, of course\nthere was going to be something like Facebook, a Gateland where they could link\none to another in ever-thicker cascades of connection. Once everyone could record\nand watch and share videos, something like YouTube was inevitable. As we try to\npicture the world ahead of us, as we try to ask what tools of power we can acquire to\ntwist this dangerous landscape into something we can manage and predict and\ncontrol, we must ask of it: What does it want? The world wants a protocol for the\nfast exchange of money. It wants a basic language protocol. It wants a place to swap\ninformation about IT security holes. It wants instant translation systems to replace\nthe need to learn to English or Chinese or Spanish so the world can move yet faster. I\nbelieve it wants certain sorts of alliances, a particular type of superpower and even\ncraves a new form of politics. For any nation that controls these gates, there is a\npossibility to use that position to create still more gatekept platforms, to shape the\nprotocols that tie platforms together in the way roads or jet planes link the physical\nworld. This is the iron law of Gateland: Connectivity is power. Which means that\ngatekeeping is, at the end of the day, our most powerful point of a control.\n163\nIt won’t surprise you that, in recent years, for instance, the world has seen an\nacceleration in the construction of physical barriers, of fences and walls running\nbetween nations and defining and in and out. Roy Hassner and Jason Wittenberg,\ntwo American political scientists, scored out the pace of global wall building and\nfound a sharp acceleration: In fact, of 51 national enclosures built since the end of\nWorld War Two – the Berlin Wall being the most famous example – more than half\nwere constructed in a rush of self-protection between 2000 and 2014 236 . And more\nare coming: Hungary, Kenya, Algeria and India now posthole their borders in initial\nexploration of what might be built. There’s a frantic urgency to some of this. The\nSpanish government, for instance, raised a ten-foot high, razor and camera topped\nfence around their Saharan footholds in 1998 – the enclosed land was controlled by\nMadrid, so it was technically “Europe,” which made an irresistible target for wouldbe\nmigrants. The fence wasn’t enough to stop the flows. So they built a second one to\nrun around the first in 2001. Then, in 2005, thousands of desperate Africans\nlaunched a coordinated charge against. A couple of dozen migrants died in the\nattempt; a thousand made it through. The Spanish responded with a third line of\nfence, this one 20 feet high, electic, camera-watched.\nThis pattern of ever more stacked defense is repeated everywhere. The walls, fences\nand trenches of the modern world seem to be getting longer, more ambitions, and\nbetter defended with each passing year, Hassner and Wittenberg concluded. Unlike\ntraditional lines of defense, the Maginot Line or the Great Wall of China for instance,\nthe aim of 21 st century barriers in places like Israel or the US or Spanish Morocco\nhave been less to stop a rolling armor blitzkreig than to slow the insidious\nmovement of smugglers and spies and criminals, or the hopeful dashes of fleeing\nrefugees. There’s an affective and – to those on the inside – appealing asymmetry to\nthese borders. They are mostly marked and built by richer, more modern, more\nstable nations desperate to control in and out. The creation of gates is, we should\nsense now, the corollary of connection. That they can sometimes be piled into the\n“winner take all” efficiencies Brian Arthur first teased out should give us a sense that\nthere is a logic to this emergence.\nReviewing the problems of deadly disease contagion after the 2015 Ebola pandemic,\nBill Gates examined this connection-and-gate lemma in the sharpest, most\nworrisome historical terms. “There is a significant chance that an epidemic of a\nsubstantially more infectious disease will occur sometime in the next 20 years,” he\nwrote. “In fact, of all the things that could kill more than 10 million people around\nthe world, the most likely is an epidemic stemming from either natural causes or\nbioterrorism.” 237 This was the cost of a fast-moving, interconnected world. It was\nwhat floated free from the extension of Paul Virilio’s line: Airplanes produced the\n236 In fact: Roy Hassner and Jason Wittenberg, “Barriers to Entry: Who Builds\nFortified Boundaries and Why?” International Security, Vol. 40, No. 1 (Summer\n2015), pp. 157–190\n237 Reviewing the problem: Bill Gates, “The Next Epidemic — Lessons from Ebola”\nNew England Journal of Medicine 2015, April 9; 372:1381-1384\n164\nairplane accident. Well, networks will produce the network accident. Many, in fact.\nA world primed for contagtion, Gates suggested, needs – and is missing – more and\nbetter gates. (Yes, here you can pause to double take at the serendipitously strange\nfact that the wealthiest citizen of our gated age is named Gates, just as the richest\nman in the era of pulling oil out of rocks was a “Rockefeller”) Connection demands\nsystems to gaze ceaselessly for the smallest sign of assault or need for change or\naccidental shimmering movement of danger. Part of what made the Ebola response\nsuccessful is that the response really was in the form of gates as we’ve come to\nunderstand them here, not walls. Protocols for biological reaction, for medical care,\nfor epidemic monitoring, the urgent helicoperting in of support and aid and ideas.\nThe gates assembled around the Ebola pandemic were its solution. Had it merely\nbeen walled off it would have spiked, grown, mutated and finally escaped.”The\nworld,” Gates wrote, “needs to build a warning and response system for outbreaks.”\nThis is true for all the outbreaks we face – whether they are disease or financial\npanic or terror. There will be, you can be sure, ignorant calls to build walls and not\ngates. This misses the point of networks. In an age of interconnection walls are\nnearly as dangerous as no walls. What matters is bulding topologies designed for\ngating, for milking power from the profound logic of networks we’ve seen at work.\nFor decades after the 1929 financial crisis triggered an historic global depression,\neconomists and politicians debated what had gone wrong. What had they missed?\nThe world, it emerged, had been wired with an economic system designed rapid\nmovement, but politicians and bankers had forgotten to put in the needed brakes.\nThey had tried to run an industrial engine against the background of gasping\npolitical structures. Basic adjustment mechanisms – release valves for financial or\ncurrency pressures – had not been invented, refined or installed. 238 When we find\nourselves in coming years gasping through some sort of financial crisis of our own,\nor running scared from a cascading military or social epidemic that slaps us\nunexpectedly, what do you think the most likely cause will be? It will be a failure of\ngates. Too few in some places; too damn many in others.\nRemember the haunting, persistent vulnerability of our age. A twitch anywhere in\nthe system can rock and even crack the whole edifice. Space Time Compression’s\nability to shrink distance to zero and time to an instant can turn anywhere, anytime\ninto a battlefield or a spot for revolutionary innovation. Any moment can present us\nwith questions of war and peace. Today we have no central theory of gatekeeping,\nno ideas about balancing inside and out. We fly on instincts, but they are the old\nindustrial ones. Anyone can see a system that is full of holes and inconsistencies. Can\nyou see a way through it, though? Pressed by political, technical and economic\ndesire – to say nothing of the basic urge for self-preservation – more gates will be\nwith us from now on.\n238 Basic adjustment: Ben S.

Lindner and Sandro Gaycken have written.\nThat line, intended for switched-on digital systems, in fact fits most of our world.\nNearly everything around us, from cities to telephone networks to refugee waves,\nare assembled by composition. Curriences are layered with encryption. Refugee\ndreams carved from photosharing and refined with GPS.

The streets are unusually clean; the\nsurveillance cameras unusually – even for Beijing – dense. The neighborhood is\nhome to many of the last of the generation of Communist Party cadres who joined\nand supported its rise decades ago. Several years ago, I found myself settled into one\nof them for an afternoon tea with Huang Hua, one of the great modern Chinese\nforeign policy figures – and a member of that early revolutionary generation. Huang\nwas, in a sense, heir to the Warring States diplomat Su Qin, whom Master Nan had\nencouraged me to study. Huang had penetrated the madness of Mao’s revolutionary\nera to see the possibility of a different order, one he’d brought to vivid life after\nDeng Xiaoping ascended to the Chinese leadership in 1976. Huang had been the\ncountry’s Foreign Minister and later a Vice Premier. He was always calm, with an\neasy and relaxed temperament. One of my favorite images of him was from the mid-\n1970s when, while sitting on a flight to the US from Paris to take China’s seat at the\nUnited Nations, he was ambushed by Walter Cronkite. Huang is completely\nunflustered in the scratchy video of that encounter. He sits quietly in a cloud of\nsmoke. Cronkite pesters him. Huang smiles, offers a cigarette to the news crew, and\nthough he is in the midst of a transit from the poverty, chaos and smashed politics of\nChina he is nothing but serene, a statesman – not the nervous representative of a\ntwitchy power.\n“Do you know the difference between Western and Chinese thinking?” Huang asked\nthat afternoon as we sat inside his courtyard house. Leaves were turning outside. He\nwas in his early 90s then, still tack-sharp. “You see, when Chinese want to do\nsomething, we begin with the question: What is the nature of the age? Westerners\nbegin with the goal. What do they aim to achieve?” Deng’s foreign policy, one Huang\nshaped and executed, had been an excellent example. Mao, who ruled China from\n1949 until 1976, had a darting, paranoid, murderously strategic temperament. The\nnature of his age, he was convinced in his Marx-addled mind, was one of zhanzheng\nyu geming – war and revolution. From this first principle, everything followed: He\nhoneycombed Beijing with bomb-proof tunnels, relocated Chinese industry to\nisolated and gaspingly poor mountain strongholds, reacted to foreign ideas or\ninfluence with a snapping electricity – and was bent on protective isolation as he\ndragged the country through one impossible and failed isolationist development\ninitiative after another.\nDeng, when he came to power in 1977, read the nature of his age too. He read it\ndifferently. “There is no possibility of a great war. Don’t be afraid of it, there is no\nrisk of it,” he assured a group of Chinese cadres during a chat in 1983. The cadres\nwere having a hard time replacing their Maoist paranoia with confidence that China\n167\nmight safely open, develop, and change. They mixed the crouching nervousness of a\nsecret political party with the vivid nightmares of a nation that had been invaded,\nabused – humiliated, they said – by nine countries since the mid-19 th Century Opium\nWars. “We used to worry about war and talk about its possibility every year,” Deng\ntold them. “It seems the worry was overdone.” The world was, he felt, entering an\nera of heping yu fazhan – peace and development. Terrible, nation-demolishing wars\nwould not soon victimize China, Deng thought. Nation building was the nature of the\nage. Its tools would be science, finance, and trade. If the Chinese people worked\nhard, he promised his incredulous listeners, they might by the year 2000 grow their\nthin $250 per capita income to the nearly unimaginable target of $1000. “I don’t\ncare if the cat is white or black,” he famously observed, “as long as it catches mice.”\nSocialism? Capitalism? No matter so long as it produced progress. Deng’s judgment\nproved out. There were no major wars. Development was, for China, the name of the\nage. The cat caught $1000 dollars of per capita income nearly on the old man’s\nschedule. It is still playing with the string.\nThere is something admirably direct about the Western way of problem solving, of\ncourse. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. It has its uses. But\nit’s also true that this sort of elementary geometry does not describe, always, the\nbest path. Particularly not today, in an era when topological collapse or instant\nconnection means that the distance from a to b can go to zero (or infinity) in a single\nsudden shift. Yes, you may be stringing a line from a to b, but if you’re putting it up\nin a tornado? Is the best route to a new Middle East really the tipping over of stable\nstates? Is the quickest path to climate control voluntary compacts? Are faster\nmarkets and more unwatched capitalism the safest way to ameliorate our\nunbalanced economics? Sometimes a more indirect line is called for. Sometimes it is\nfaster, safer. Huang Hua’s question – “Where is the world going, after all?” – turns\nout to be the first essential one for any endeavor. If you are not looking from the\nhighest possible altitude, Chinese will warn you, you are not seeing the full picture.�\nThe nature of our age has, I think, emerged clearly, vividly and broadly for us now.\nConstant, instant, everywhere connectivity taps with the efficient mercilessness of a\nsteel hammer on the glass of most of our comfortable institutions. The Seventh\nSense has let us understand a bit about the origins of this creative violence. And it\nhas shown us too that our era’s dominant feature is not merely cracking disruption,\nbut also the construction of new orders. Da po, Da li the Chinese might say – great\ndestruction and great construction. This is the nature of our age. Tap, tap, crack. And\nthen: Gatelands – speed-bred by technology and filled with possibility. That some of\nthese gated worlds contain billions of people or trillions of sensors, computer chips\nor network nodes only strengthens their inexorable grip. That they can be so easily\nor even accidentally weaponized marks the edginess of our problem. That they will\nbe built atop the sharp-edged shards of a collapsing older system heightens the\nurgency at which they must emerge. To be inside, we’ve seen, delivers the lightspeed\nbenefits of time compression, of life on a nearly alive mesh. To be outside? It\nis to be cut off.\n168\nI said earlier that I wanted to lay the Seventh Sense onto the problems of war and\npeace and grand strategy – and while the insights our new instinct reveals are lifegiving\nfor business and eye-opening for culture, it’s to the devious and unavoidable\nproblem of global order I want to turn now. In a now-famous 1986 speech “You and\nYour Research”, the Bell Labs scientist Richard Hamming set three questions for\nanyone embarked on the exploration of new ideas: “1. What are the most important\nproblems in your field? 2. Are you working on one of them? 3. Why not?” 240 Well, the\nmost important problem in the field of global affairs is the question of the future of\nworld order, of how it will emerge – and what sort of aspect it may yet present. It is\nthe problem to be working on. It also touches, like it or not, whatever the most\nimportant problem in your field is: Opening new markets, educating your kids,\nplanning five years of corporate growth. Remember the distinction from earlier in\nthe book, the difference between living at an ordinary moment and an historic one?\nThe difference between Warsaw in 1539 and 1939? In one age, history is irrelevant;\nin the other it nearly throttles you. You can’t avoid being touched. We live in an\nhistoric era, not least because the connections that define our age means epochal\nquakes in one part of the system will rattle other bits too.\nA feeling for history – Nietzche’s old “Sixth Sense” – should fire up invisibly in us bit\nnow as we think about what life in an historic age might mean for us. The surprises\nin our news every day. The creaking of our old institutions. What do they augur? The\npolitical scientists Charles S. Gochman and Zeev Maoz once made a survey of history\nto see if they could spot just when the world slipped from calm moments to\nepochally unettled ones. They surveyed nearly 1,000 wars, big and small, hunting\nfor patterns as you or I might look for trends in stock prices or sports scores.\nIncreasing complexity, they discovered, almost always shook the world into conflict.\nStates, armies, political groups, newly independent nations, ideological and religious\nforces emerge and then collide in their young energy, each driven by different aims\nand values and dreams. A cycle marks the process. First, disputes over small matters\naccelerate – as they are doing now. Everything seems open to question: Do you\ncontrol this trade route? Who says we have to respect this arms limit? The\ncombined pressure of so many simultaneous disagreements announces a shift in the\npattern of all relations. A logical loop follows: “The frequency of disputes,” Gochman\nand Moaz explain, “appears to be an early indicator of system transformation…The\nrise in the number of disputes seems to indicate a decline in the degree of consensus\non the ‘rules’ of the international order. This heightened dissensus (often\nculminating in large-scale wars) is followed by restructuring.” 241 Pressure on the\nrules. Small cracks. Large scale war. Re-ordering. Like water moving from ice to\nliquid to steam and back, this cycle has a predictable logic. It ran in the age of\nBismarck and culminated in World War One. It spun again in the age between last\ncentury’s great wars too, tripping into a second World War. And it ran as well in the\n240 “What are”: Richard Hamming, “You and Your Research”, Simula Research\nLaboratory (Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 2010) Chapter 6\n241 The politial scientists: Charles S. Gochman and Zeev Maoz, “Militarized\nInterstate Disputes, 1816-1976: Procedures, Patterns, and Insights”, The Journal of\nConflict Resolution, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Dec., 1984), pp. 585-616\n169\nfracturing of ancient China during the Spring and Autumn era or in the Roman\nEmpire in the age of the Caesars. Our current shifting – that tap, tap on every\nnation’s politics, media, and economics – isn’t really so unpredictable after all. 242\nYou may know the old saw of military parade evaluation: That the more magnificent\na nation’s uniforms are the weaker it’s army usually is. But the gold-braided\nadmirals of some three-ship navy reflect a very human need for security, and\nparticularly for a self-decided feeling of security. Every nation has it’s own foreign\naffairs aims. Each cherishes a certain national image, memories of military glory and\nof “interests” inseparable from culture or identity. The goals of the French and the\nTurks, for instance, each evoke an encyclopedia of history, tradition and politics.\nUneasiness in Paris about capitalism and immigration, for instance; or Anrka’s\nworry about ethnic division, fundamentalisms, and the creeping nuclear progress of\ntheir neighbors. Our era’s revolutionary logic will shape choices in every nation\ndifferently. But I’d like here to discuss American foreign policy. America plays a\ncentral role in world order now. The country’s leading position makes her, to some\ndegree, an unavoidable gatekeeper. In the Napoleonic era, nearly every revolution\nor war could be tied to energies emanating from Paris. During the Cold War most\npuzzles of politics or geography might be framed in terms of a zero-sum competition\nwith the USSR. In our own age, we’ll find most every problem links to networks and\ntheir new logic. And – for now at least – to America. Thomas Paine’s memorable 250\nyear-old assessment, that “The cause of America is the cause of all mankind,”\ntouches this linked universalism in a way he never could have imagined.\n“Betweeness” or “Centrality” are the way network science labels and measures such\na role. Just how essential is a certain nation or trading platform or point? The\nnetworks of America won’t, in the future, be the only networks. They will be less\n“between”. But they will be, always and indelibly, the first reference for design.\nIf the traditional aim of American foreign policy was to prevent the emergence of a\nchallenger that threatened the country directly, or that might fence off and\nmanipulate Asia or Europe or Latin America against Washington’s aims, the concern\nnow is different: Mastery of topological destiny. There are those who observe, as an\nAmerican think tank noted in 2015, “Today the United States faces no existential\nthreat.” 243 This is wrong. The emergence and shape of networks is just such a\ndanger. Security, the great foreign policy theorist Andre Wolfers once wrote, is “the\nabsence of threats to acquired values.” 244 The networks around us, as we’ve seen,\nare demolishing older values. Often because we want them to. Any revolutionary\ntechnology unbuttons an older order this way. But we now approach this\ndestabilized world with a sort of wideyed panic. Control terrorism, manage climate\n242 Our current shifting: See also Lars-Erik Cederman, T. Camber Warren, and\nDidier Sornette, “Testing Clausewitz: Nationalism, Mass Mobilization, and the\nSeverity of War” International Organization 65, Fall 2011, pp 605–38\n243 “America faces no existential threat”: See James Dobbins, et al. Choices for\nAmerica in a Turbulent World (Santa Monica: RAND Corporation, 2015) xiv\n244 In his classic essay: Andre Wolfers, “’National Security’ as an ambigious\nsymbol’”, Political Science Quarterly, 67 (1952) 485\n170\nchange, lock in great-state peace. So many desires scatter our minds and when we\nfail to achieve them they erode our will. Here is a basic lesson of accomplishment in\nany human domain: Better for us to focus on a single aim, and tighten our efforts\naround that one aim and use success to strengthen our will. The answer to the great,\nnewly-charged existential question of politics – “Are you a gatekeeper or the\ngatekept?” – is not yet decided for the United States. So, strategy first: We live in a\nconnected age where power is sliding into that gated order we’ve learned about.\nAmerica’s role? Not to make the entire world democratic. Not to try to bomb or\nforce stability onto every nation now collapsing under network pressures. Not to\npassively wait for our version of history to “win”. Not to thwart the rise of other\ncountries. No. The strategy that fits the nature of our age and position is to perfect\nand then operate the essential, topological mechanisms of power now. Sometimes\nwith warm humanity; other times with the ruthlessness demanded by the touch of\ndanger and evil. This involves gates. It involves firmness and nerve and willpower. It\ndemands what we might call Hard Gatekeeping.\n2.\nEverything around us now is or soon will be connected. Access to our trade, the use\nof technology and networks, our defense or our currency – all of these must be\nconsidered as gated systems. Each will come to throb with new power as a result of\ntheir links, as a byproduct of their escalating sensitivity, intelligence and power, and\nfrom that in-or-out distinction. Much remains to be instantly, fully linked in this\nway. Our education. Our medicine. Our military. Real-time information, sensors and\nmachine intelligence will erect Gatelands in each of these areas and in others. These\nwalls will go up even faster than real-world berms and fences. The strategic position\nof any nation or terror group or business is not going to be secured by industrial\nmeasures. No one at Google wants to build a newspaper. No one in Al-Qaeda is\ntrying to float an aircraft carrier. Rather, it will be determined in the construction of\nnew tools, which largely means the building of a new, gated order.\n“Every new age and every new epoch in the coexistence of peoples,” the historian\nCarl Schmitt once wrote, “is founded on new spatial divisions, new enclosures, and\nnew spatial orders of the earth.” Schmitt was contemplating history: The great\nMediterranean empires and the long, millennial power trails of Asian chieftains. But\nhis insight touches every age, our own included. To make a nation, to build an\nempire, is to draw lines, to push at borders, to smash at gates. Some of this is the\nwild martial ambition of a Napoleon or Hitler (who Schmitt unwisely advised); often\nit is simple protection. Lord Balfour, serving as Foreign Secretary, contemplated this\nproblem from his imperial vantage in 1918 and observed: “Every time I come to a\ndiscussion – an intervals of say, five years – I find there is a new sphere we have got\nto guard,” he wrote. “Those gateways are getting further and further away from\nIndia, I don’t know how far west they are going to be brought by the General\nStaff.” 245 This problem of where exactly to put the gates confronts us now as well.\n245 “Those gateways”: Quoted in Robert Jervis, “Cooperation Under the Security\nDilemma”, World Politics Vol 30, Issue 2 (Jan, 1978) p. 169\n171\nGatekeeping, as we’ve seen, isn’t simply the act of marking geographic lines. Those\nhurrying walls and berms and triple-fences of the real world are a kind of\ngatekeeping but they are also, I’m pretty sure, expressions of a deeper desire. Each\nis a real-world defense against topological pressures of population and ideology and\nviolence, all shaped by network magnetism. The likely futility of such gates is clear\nenough when you contemplate the forces they are intended to keep out: Refugees\nsee prosperity miles on their phones. Little wonder they rush at it. Internettransmitted\nmessages light up ideologies, protests or fundamentalisms that pull\npeople back and forth endlessly across physical borders. The world responds, as\nanyone without a Seventh Sense might, with walls. But to focus merely on the\nphysical? This is to misread the issue. Gatekeeping includes real-world borders, of\ncourse, but the statesmen of the future will act particularly on topologies. They will\nwork not merely to stop up flows, but to decide their movement. Gates will, for\ninstance, serve as bespoke disease buffers, created to track and then freeze the\nworrisome pandemics now crawling at us on the connections of our age. Other gates\nwill be economic tools: The will help isolate and then soothe the unstable and\napparently broken, middle-class eroding financial patterns of the past decades.\nRecall how the design of computer or network systems affects the real world, like a\nmarble slipped under a carpet? Gatekeeping’s topological design is like placing\nmarbles (or boulders) in particular ways, to direct movements and flows as you\nmight guide water with a canal. The great historian Arnold Toynbee once recalled a\npassing moment with British Prime Minister Lloyd George during the endless (and\ndisastrous) Paris Peace Conference of 1919. “Lloyd George, to my delight, had\nforgotten my presence,” Toynbee wrote, “and began to think aloud.\n‘Mesopotamia…yes…oil…irrigation…we must have Mesopotamia; Palestine…yes…\nthe Holy Land… Zionism… we must have Palestine…; Syria… h’m… what is there in\nSyria? Let the French have that.” 246 This sort of charmless arrogance – The Holy\nLand….We must have that – doesn’t much suit our age, but that comprehensive view?\nWhat oil and irrigation and Suez were to Lloyd George, emergence and data flows\nand gates are to us. There’s a crucial difference, however: We need not take the most\nprecious territory of our age through invasion or colonial exploitation or in misbalanced\npeace settlements. We can build the essential landscape of power. We can\nbuild it for defense. And then we can grow it, perfect it, and attract others. Schmitt\nwas right, human history is the story of enclosures – and nothing about our\nemerging age suggests any other approach can, with a single clear line, solve the\nvexing network x network x weapons problems we face. Hard Gatekeeping means\nmolding the landscape, gate by gate, to encourage certain movements and make\nothers difficult, costly, maybe even impossible. Any future order must begin with\nthis first principle: The line between in and out is as essential as what goes on\ninside.\n246 Lloyd George: Margaret MacMillan, Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the\nWorld, (New York: Random House, 2002) p. 381\n172\nThe goals of Hard Gatekeeping are simple enough to state: To protect those inside\nthe gated order, to make security and innovation more efficient, to accelerate\ncertain kinds of connection and dampen others, to manage vulnerable links to the\nnon-gatekept world and – perhaps most important– to use that “in or out” leverage\nto relentlessly affect the interests and plans of others. These aims are the root of real\nsecurity in any age. “In anarchy, security is the highest end,” Kenneth Waltz wrote.\n“Only if survival is assured can states seek other goals such as tranquility, profit and\npower.” 247 Survival – and Waltz’s other essential aims – will be decided by the\nnature of our future connection. In this sense, Hard Gatekeeping produces a decisive\nchange in our posture. It lets us aim for something instead of merely being against\nmovement or – hopelessly – against the future. It establishes priorities, clarifies our\nreal core interests, helps us budget our effort and our expenses – better, perhaps, to\nspend a trillon dollars building tools of topological mastery like infrastructure or\nnew technology than chasing Middle East peace. 248 Gatekeeping does not transcend\nthe long-standing debates between the cold realism of Stalin and the idealism of\nWoodrow Wilson so much as it sets us a preliminary task: Shaping the environment.\nTo build and control the next generation of gatekept systems should be our aim\nnow. In the future paper currency wil be replaced by secure digital bit transactions.\nGenetic information will demand smart, live-connected platforms for efficient\nmining and study. Cyber and biological security will each come to be defined by\nhigh-speed, machine-intelligent protocols. All of these are gatekept cores. Mastering\nthem will be as important as having military bases, trade missions or treaty\narrangements once was. The development of such systems plays to our strengths;\nthey deliver both security and useful pressures of innovation. Remember – the aim\nisn’t to build walls. It is to use the logic of networks and gates, and all the complex\nproductive force they release.\nThe elements of Hard Gatekeeping can be stated simply enough:\n3.\nFirst, Does it work for us? We seek a landscape of technology, trade, finance,\nknowledge – all the tools of power – that balances the pressures of politics with a\ncolder grasp of longer-term national interest. The protocols, alliances, treaties and\ndata webs that enable markets, trade or thinking machines – all are gatelands we\ncan cultivate, improve and protect. Our gatelands must be designed to limit the\nrippling risks of contagion or error moving wildly, like spring weather, inside linked\ncomplex systems now. Control of topologies is what air superiority or sea mastery\nonce were. The opening attacks of future wars will come invisibly and silently\nthrough networks, in space, in fast topological strikes – not with noisy land\ninvasions or bombing runs. Well-built gates will give us time and leverage. They will\n247 “In anarchy”: Kenneth Waltz, Theory of International Politics, (Reading, MA:\nAddison-Wesley, 1979), 126\n248 It establishes: For a discussion about why a grand strategy is of practical use see\nHal Brands, “The Promise and Pitfalls of Grand Strategy,” Strategic Studies Institute,\nExternal Associates Monograph Program, 2012\n173\ndeliver the honestly-earned confidence of the secure. They will provide purchase for\nthe patient work of diplomacy, a marked shift from the crisis-to-crisis lurching of\ntoday.\nThe texture of our values should be everywhere woven into these gatelands we will\ncultivate: Democratic choice, freedom of thought, privacy. We won’t have time for\nleisurely deliberation about ideals in the crashing, time-compacted crises ahead, so\nwe should begin with them. Let other nations measure gated enclosures for their\ndifferent values, marked by their paranoias and historical burdens; our strength will\nbe an order that reflects our habits of civilization. The curious, open-minded\nsearching native to our temperament, for instance. This will force constant\ninnovation and evolution, an antidote to the failure to change that poisons most\nclosed systems. A continued absence of gates will undo us in the short run. But the\nlong run will be a disaster if our gates are inflexible, too closed, incapable of upgrade\nor – worse – girded by promises and fears that are not naturally our own.\nA second principle is that we ought not force anyone else to use our gated systems.\nGatekeeper or gatekept? No more profound, painful, liberating or enslaving political\nchoice now exists. Nations must be free to select, in as much as they can, their own\nterms of enmeshment. Our aim should simply be to build the best order we can.\nAmerica’s tremendous economic and technical lead serves us – for now, at least – as\nthe isolating stretch of the Atlantic and Pacific once did. There’s no need to force\nothers to follow us. Recall Greshams’ famous “economic law”: The way in which the\nbad drives out the good. A stock market made of swindlers won’t attract investors\nfor very long. Well, in many networks, a sort of reverse-Gersham’s law applied. The\ngood drives out the bad. By this I don’t mean merely the self-cleaning properties of\nsystems like Wikipedia. But of linked systems more broadly. If one nation runs a\nDNA database where results are skewed by rules of political power – family\nmembers of leaders get special access for instance – it will make it less effective, and\ntherefore less appealing as a gateland. So we should be relaxed about letting Europe\nor Russia or China try their own gated systems. Their desires reflect sensible,\nunderstandable urges. If you were leading a nation would you rely on Washington’s\ntrade or financial commitments? Because of the nature of power now many nations\nmay have no other choice; but forcing them to enmeshment could bring shattering,\nunnecessary pressure. Let them divide themselves from us; it will only weaken\nthem.\nWe need not evangelize, invade, or compel our way to power. Consider the case of\nglobal trade. For decades after World War Two, many nations sought independence\nfrom economic entanglement. They yearned for autarky. They scorned trade. And\nthey nearly bankrupted themselves in the process: Want to buy Portuguese cars?\nFrench computers? Indian bikinis? I didn’t think so. The whole point of trade was to\nsolve such imbalances of skill and trade. When the age of connection began after the\nCold War, most countries made a decisive shift: They arranged their economies to\nbe attractive to global financial flows. Trade grew twice as fast as the world\neconomy. The cost of being left out was, and is, a nearly impossible burden.\nAmerican systems, if they work for America, should have the same magnetic appeal,\n174\nthe power-law dynamics Brian Arthur found in the most successful network\narrangements. Getting it right is enough of a task. If we can manage that, what we\nbuild will run with unimpeachable legitimacy. Chosen, not forced.\nA third principle is that our gates and protocols and webs ought to be open to\nothers, but with each new link weighed, added to the scale of strategic balance with\nexacting care. An overarching, systemic view should inform us. Nations that want to\nuse our cyber security systems, for instance, should join research cooperatives – and\npossibly shoulder as well some problems of global network health like the\nimplementation of IPv6 or DNSSEC, or any of the future jointly secur standars that\nwill emerge. They should even – here is where the leap comes – be required to\ncooperate on nuclear proliferation, cybercrime, or trade norms. The puzzle here is\nclear: How to use our strengths to address our dangers? While we can’t directly\npress our lead in cancer research to stop national flirtations with nuclear bombs or\ncyber crime, it’s probably true that a cost of weapons proliferation should be\nexclusion from life-giving technical and trade and other gated orders. Remember\nthat feature of network systems now, how the cost of exclusion grows even faster\nthan the benefits of inclusion? If the aim of any society in this connected age is to\naccelerate the compression of time for its citizens, than life outside the best gates for\nthis will be a nearly fatal political cost. Do you really want to rely on French\ncomputers? Wear Indian bikinis? Do Iranians want to rely on Iranian cyber-security\ntools alone? It is ever-easier for citizens of nations sliced free from vital networks to\nfeel what they don’t have.\nThe courage to leave some nations out of the order we’re constructing – and to cut\nothers out – doesn’t come easily to us. Today we don’t really engage in a\ncomprehensive, linked strategy. Iranian proliferation and Chinese finance and Saudi\nmilitary support are, for all practical purposes, separated in our contemplation of\nthe world. Hard Gatekeeping frames these together as a piece; it spots the\ntopological string running between each and gives us a firm position from which to\npull the threads we want. We will come to know, to pay, the costs of over-inclusion.\nBut this also means that we must be concerned with the security and safety of\nothers, on our network or on others. To attempt to achieve absolute American\nsecurity, to do so at the expense of other nations – this will not only erode the\ncredibility of any system we build. It will also make them fundamentally less\neffective. We are, after all, what we are conneted to.\nFourth, no nation should be permitted to force another inside of its own gates. India\nmight develop a great search engine; they should not be allowed to force\nBangladeshis to use it. China may develop clever trade channels to Europe; they\nshould not drive their use with military pressure. This principle is the flip side of our\nown commitment not to compel others into American gatekept systems. It\nrepresents an important nod to sovereign power: Each nation decides on its own. If\nwe’re intent on avoiding some of the chaos of the last major system change, which\nproduced the Thirty Years War, we should learn its lessons. That fight\nfundamentally touched on one question: Who decides what happens inside a\ncountry? The specific problem of Europe 350 years ago was if each King could\n175\ndecide the religion of his state. The treaties that settled this debate in 1648 – after\nthe most devastating wars in European history at that time – established Cuius regio,\neius religio as the governing principle. Whose realm, whose religion. The very notion\nof a “state” is itself being eroded as topologies, migrations, and superfast data links\neat at old borders. But nations remain an essential container of power. A rapid\ncollapse of that system would be a disaster, and is frankly unlikely. To be American.\nFrench. Chinese. This still matters.\nDo we demand that other nations use our protocols? Do we force China or Germany\nto rules of transparency, data tracking of their citizens and research that we obey?\nNo. Cuius reticulum, eius reticulum. Whose realm, whose network. But, at the same\ntime, should we permit China or Germany to force another nation into its trading\nregime? It’s biological or cyber networks? To the question, “What would America\nfight against in a gatekept world?” one answer is this: We would resist any attempt\nto force-fit a nation to a gated order. We should prepare for difficult, expensive\nfights to maintain this principle. Russia watching neighboring states seduced into a\nChinese trading order or an American technological system won’t bubble with silent\nacquiescence. Arrangements that tilt trade to one side of the Pacific will unnerve\nChina or Japan – or the US. But, in the end, the control logic of cuius reticulum buffers\nus, as a sort of law, against a wilder madness of collapsed nations.\nFifth, we should not permit the emergence of any means to destroy our system. The\nvery efficiency of connected architectures makes them vulnerable. Networks, by\ndesign, have holes that particular modes of attack can exploit. Contagion. Strikes\nagainst central nodes. 249 Arms racing of a certain type. Our first attempt to limit risk\nshould be defensive. Better gates. But we’d be foolish to stop there. Gates, the\nTrojans would remind us, are not enough. When truly existential dangers emerge –\nnuclear weapons, certain types of artificial intelligence or genetic engineering – then\nwe must attack. Hard Gatekeeping should include a coiled, prepared readiness to\nstrike with the same light-speed movement that defines the dangers we fear. Of\ncourse we should try to deter such attacks. But we should be realistic. There’s much\nwe can’t deter. And the cost of attack is awfully cheap. We won’t be truly safe\nwithout battle plans and diplomatic gambits that can hammer at the topological and\nreal world vulnerabilities of our enemies. After all, they will be hammering on ours.\nOur defense task is simple to say, hard to achieve: From the largest symmetrical\nsuperpower in history, America needs to become the greatest asymmetrical one –\ncapable of devastating, instant action anywhere in the real or topological world.\nNetwork scientists who study the power of “centrality” have shown the way that\ncertain positions in a topology – think of a rainforest, a travel network or a stock\nexchange – wield unusual influence. Centrality of a certain node in linked systems\ncan determine control, it can produce “super spreaders” which instantly shape\n249 Strikes against: I.A. Kovacs, A-L. Barabasi, “Destruction Perfected,” Nature\n(News & Views) 2015, 524, 38-39\n176\nlinked topologies 250 . Contagions, panics, economic brain freezes – these are the\nessential tactics of our future. The maintenance of our centrality on the topologies\nwe rely on is, then, the essential part of our future security. Interrupting this is, of\ncourse, exactly the edge our enemies seek against us: To infect us – with panic,\nterror or some virtual or real virus. To alter the landscape with one sharp razor\nslice, not a hail of bombs.\nThere is no excuse for us to not prepare to struggle in these new terms. Our military\nmust be shifted for the demands of such instant, cross-space attack. But it’s more\nthan that. In recent years America has gotten into a habit of reaching for our military\ntool, and while we’ve strengthened it to an historically unprecedented degree, we’ve\nlet other skills atrophy. Our real aim should be to stop our opponents from adapting,\nevolving and connecting to us. If we suffer some strategic, nation-crippling defeat in\nthe future, I don’t think it will be because our military was weak. Rather it will be\nbecause we’ve not mastered all the other tools of topological control. The first sign\nof our real awarness of this will be when the old, foolishly vulnerable systems and\ntactics and ideas are replaced. We should never build another aircraft carrier\nwithout a sense of new, networked naval plan. The idea of spending hundreds of\nbillions for manned bomber planes is absurd. We should embrace self-imposed\nlimits, we should force ourselves to innovate both with our military and in the\ncreation of new tools of policy. Doing so will prevent any number of conflicts. And it\nwill stiffen our temperament to unconventional thinking.\nThere’s a lean efficiency to these five principles that define Hard Gatekeeping. The\nstrategy echoes, in its clarity, in its clean frugality, the postures of some of the most\nenduring orders in human history: The “defense in depth” of the Roman Empire, for\ninstance. The protective order of Tokugawa Japan. The walls of Tang China, part of a\nchained national history that celebrates heroes as “defenders of the nation,” not\nattackers. Gatekeeping resists unnecessary profligacy. It limits the need to\nproselytize or colonize or force others to our way of thinking. And it has a universal\naspect: Hard Gatekeeping can – with a little imagination and some discipline – be\nlaid on puzzles like terrorism, cyberattacks, US-China relations, order in the Middle\nEast, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, income inequality and global warming. It\nprovides a sharp single image of what we’re after – and guidelines for getting there.\nIt’s clear enough what we need to do, I think. Build gates. Use them. Hold inside\nthem and protect the curious, innovative and revolutionary spirit of our people and\nour age.\nLet’s use this approach to examine some particular problems, and let’s start with\nUS-China ties – a puzzle whose resolution may be the decisive act of policy in the\n4.\n250 Super spreaders: Manlio De Domenico, Albert Sole ́-Ribalta, Elisa Omodei,\nSergio Gomez & Alex Arenas, “Ranking in Interconnected Multilayer Networks\nReveals Versatile Nodes”, Nature Communications April 23, 2015\n177\nnext century. How might Huang Hua, with his nature-of-the-age consideration of\nstrategy have regarded the matter? What does gatekeeping tell us?\nThe dominant view of future relations between Americans and Chinese generally\nruns along a nervously familiar historical track: An established power (the US) and a\nrising one (China) consider each other. Do they cooperate? Scratch at each other in\nconstant annoyance? Each nation possesses a different image the world. Each holds,\nas well, distinct pictures of their role. One power has enjoyed a long period of\nprosperity, has built and defended a global structure; the other, trod mercilessly\nunderfoot by history, feels the unbearable flow of power’s rising sap, a hunger for\nrecognition and release and for some, revenge; her economy craves resources, trade\nroutes, and markets. So Germany encountered and then attacked Great Britain at the\nturn of the 20 th Century. Japan collided, similarly, with Russia in 1904. France taking\non Austria, Russia and Great Britain in the Napoleonic age.\nEven if the leaders of the United States and China intend to avoid conflict, they face\none of the most sobering, if not depressing, problems of international politics: The\n“security dilemma”. The world is a dangerous place. So countries do things to feel\nsafer. Their populations demand it. Germany looks at Britain’s imperial navy in the\n1890s: London could snap Berlin’s trade arteries. So the Kaiser orders two\nbattleships. Britain builds three in response. Germany turns to submarines. And so\non. Each country, chasing her own security, ends up less secure. This is the\n“dilemma”. The puzzle is like one of those woven wicker finger traps: The harder\neach side pulls to get out, the more stuck they become. America in 2012 pivots her\nmilitary gaze to Asia. China feels encircled. She orders a couple of aircraft carriers,\npaves remote islands into military bases. America flies aircraft closer to Chinese\nwaters. Are the two sides more secure? Collisions, arms racing, accelerating distrust\nbecome the threnody of contacts. Each side seeks something impossible: Perfect\nsecurity. Move first, certain forces begin to whisper in each capital.\nThe essence of this problem today, as the United States and China consider their\nfuture, is not merely or even mainly in the details of trade, territory, or cyber\ndisputes we read about. These hot points are important, of course, but they are\nsymptoms of differing judgments of the world, of a fracture at that first step of\nasking, “What is the nature of the age?” Americans generally believe the existing\nglobal power map is just, sustainable, in need – perhaps – of minor adjustments.\nAmerica engineered this system; benefits tremendously from it’s fictionless\noperation. China regards that same layout differently. As broken, unbalanced,\nrocking towards a seizure – and, anyhow, built, lubricated and run without her\nparticipation. This view is sharpened by ideology, national psychology and the bald\nfact that no global mechanism ever functions perfectly. The larger nature of the age\nis, many in Beijing feel, Da po, Da li. Great destruction. Great construction. Certainly\nthis is true inside China; it must be true outside. The nation has it’s hammers out.\nThey see the paradoxes of power we read about earlier, the inability to act and the\ncollapse of American credibility, as clearly as people in Washington or Damascus or\nMoscow. Surely the global system should be adjusted, they think. Tap. Tap.\n178\nSo though no inherent enmity exists between the two countries, a crack emerges.\nEach side finds reasons not to cooperate. A shared interest in peace – neither side\nwants a collision, both understand the costs – is shimmied apart by a perception\ngap. Cultural, historical, temperamental and ideological differences accelerate the\nunzipping of even the best intentions. Misunderstanding bends and then snaps\nirrevocably into mistrust. So yes, the recovered islands and the trade tensions and\nthe political theories have to be managed because each is a blister that limits\nforward motion – but the real source of friction? It is the scraping of different world\nviews. This is deep strategic misalignment. It is, in fact, the stuff of war.\nIn recent years, America has had two different, nearly opposite approaches to China,\neach however marked by an assured national confidence that the current world\norder is sustainable. One policy is short-handed as “engagement” – or, colloquially,\n“panda hugging.” As China becomes more prosperous, this approach suggests, she\nwill become more congenial to American interests. More cuddly. This was, for some,\nthe basis for bringing China into the World Trade Organization in the 1990s. Later it\njustified deep commercial links and educational ties. The logic of such an approach\nfit the mindset of many baby-boomer Americans: China’s attraction to MTV,\nMcDonalds and Mercedes hinted at a still deeper desire they thought. To be\nWestern. China’s citizens would surely become more attracted and committed to the\nworld system that had delivered all this prosperity. The country would become\nmore global, in a sense, and less Chinese.\nIn fact, as China has grown in recent years she has become more global and more\nChinese. Growth, wealth, an admixture of confidence into the old national habit of\ninsecurity – all of these have encouraged a searching exploration. The demands of\ndomestic politics, the instincts of the Chinese Communist Party and the inevitable\npractical questions of security and reform all produce sensible questions. China\nneeds oil, for instance. Must she project power into the Middle East? Control the sea\nlanes of the Malacca Straits? There’s no natural, inherent resistance to American\ninterests in any one problem, but that hopeful American logic of “engagement”\nignores much about China’s essence. The country presses at rules she mistrusts (as\nAmerica once did). She struggles with the inevitable challenges of a political system\nstill smoking a bit from recent revolutions – and, of course, facing the pressures of a\nnetworked age. But she holds, strongly, a sense of Chineseness. Can we honestly\nexpect to use mere prosperity to change China in a predictable, pro-American way?\n“Engagement” feels to Chinese like a demand to become more American. That\nprospect is as appealing as a request to become more Chinese would be for\nAmericans.\nAn alterative strategy to “engagment” is known as “containment”. (While not\nformally called “Panda Kicking”, this is often what this policy looks like.) This view\ntakes it for granted that as China becomes more powerful she will become a threat.\nAny growth in Chinese power means a decline in America’s influence and security. A\nstronger China in Asia, for instance, means a weaker America. Countries like Japan\nor Korea or the Philippines will be required to choose a side at some point, at some\nawful 21 st Century Melian moment. The aim of containment is to squelch China\n179\nbefore such a fork appears. This approach, too, has its logical problems. Boxing the\nlargest economy in the world hardly seems sensible – and is likely not achievable.\nAnyhow, early attempts to do so have shown how little leverage the US has. When\nChina announced plans to build an Asian Investment and Infrastructure Bank in\n2014, the US opposed it and then watched as nearly all of Washington’s traditional\nallies raced to join.\nAt the same time, China’s policy towards the US has been hard to decipher for many:\nIs the country intent on amity or enmity? It’s clear enough that the American\noptions presented to Beijing are unappetizing: Change or be contained. Messages by\nChina in response have tickled the natural historical pessimism of American political\nleaders. China speaks of wanting a new kind of relations with America, of cultivating\nrich technological and financial ties, but the country at the same moment challenges\neasy assumptions about how foreign investment, educational or security\ncooperation might mesh together like gears of friendly progress. It’s hard to do\nbusiness in the Mainland. The military grows with astonishing speed. Domestic\nhabits of smash-mouth competition rattle at more sedate Western habits. Any\nelement of China’s actions are explainable and even sensible when seen with\nsympathetic eyes – but the same exact facts can be stitched into a story that suggests\nconstant damage to American interests. China’s position is, to be honest, a difficult\none: The country is opaque to most foreigners, wrapped in habits and instincts that\nrun along such different lines that even simple daily decisions – how to run a\nmeeting, for example – can be a source of disagreement. In the west you prize\ndiamonds for their clarity, Chinese will say, in China we prize jade because it is cloudy.\nThere’s a charm in opacity; even a bit of sensible political magic at times. But China\nis moving out into the world very rapidly, now: Fast and dimly understood don’t\nfuse into easy trust.\nIn one sense, then, it’s possible to sense the tense, angry energy of an impending\ncollision. Beijing and Washington are enacting the old historical pattern. Wrestling\nfor years over small issues, never quite coming to grips, slowly pulling at each other\nuntil a final, fatal collapse. Germany and Great Britain, all over again. But: Connection\nchanges the nature of an object. So much in our world looks different after connected\ndynamics are applied. Might connection change the nature of enmity? We are, after\nall, part of the same connected skein. We’ve concluded that America’s greatest\nthreat is not China or Russia or terrorism – but the evolution of the network itself.\nThat same topological evolution menaces Beijing too. If China is not our biggest\nenemy, if we are not theirs – what might be developed? Might the rat trap of history\nremain unsprung?\nAn American “China Policy” shouldn’t be regarded as some distinct initiative; rather\nit must be a part of a grand strategic program of Hard Gatekeeping. Our goal aim\nisn’t some shimmeringly perfect “China Policy” so much as it is to cultivate a grand\nstrategic disposition that informs what we undertake in cyber, Russia, the Middle\nEast, and China. Imagine we had a terrific “China policy” and a backfiring “Nuclear\nweapons policy”? Masterful grand strategy is marked by a comprehensive elegance.\nMetternich’s old construction, “A Concert of Nations” tells the story pretty well: A\n180\nsymphonic effort, each note and instrument in place. Grand strategy tells us what to\ndo at every moment.\nAny policy, then, must begin with a summary of our aims: “We believe the world is\nentering a period of profound change that demands a shift in global arrangements.\nWe are building a gatekept order consistent with our values. We welcome others to\nparticipate in it – but with conditions. We will resist attempts to force nations into\nany gatekept order; we will fight any forces that threaten disruption of the overall\nsystem.” The China policy that emerges from this view is clear enough: We will not\ncontain China. We will not force China to change. Rather we will develop a profound\ngatekept network for our own operation, one that layers together all the concerns of\neconomics, trade, security and technology – as if we were designing a technical\nsystem for fast, constant links. We will include other nations that want to be a part\nof it, as long as they are willing to bear certain costs. China is welcome to develop\nher own system and see whom she might attract inside. She will not be permitted to\ncompel nations to join. And: If China wants the benefits of a US-led order, then\nBeijing must be prepared to support the maintenance of that order. That means\ndeeper cooperation on everything from nuclear proliferation to the establishment of\nnew international bodies for connected finance, biological research or nuclear deproliferation.\nSuch an approach resolves, in an instant, the contradictions of our current policy.\nHere is our gated order, we can say, join if you wish and on the terms we both consider\nbest. We should remember: China has much to worry about. Disorder would land on\nher own hopes for peace and development with a profound, possibly crushing\npressure. The international order is not working as well as it might. It does not\nappear engineered for new stresses. It is in cooperation for the reform of that\nsystem that the two nations share an urgent interest. And it is in a successful\ndefensive posture of a gatekept, network order that Washington can cultivate the\nlinked, leveraged moves that will encourage this to happen. While there might be a\ntemptation to play this game in that old Lloyd George sort of way – “We need the\nMiddle East. Grab it. We need digital currency mastery. Take it!” – such efforts will\nonly assure final, fatal collision between the two powers. We need a gatekept order.\nBuild it. That is enough.\nWhat the Seventh Sense statesman sees, in the way a Seventh Sense entrepreneur or\nterrorist or researcher can, is the pulsing network logic that is at work breeding a\nnew world – like it or not. And our policy has to aim for that future state, not for\nwhat we have today. If this sounds difficult, you should know that in most complex\nadaptive systems these kinds of adjustments frequently occur. Rainforests. Traffic\njams. The human brain. Anyplace connections are knit and reknit at light speed can\nexhibit a pattern of rapid redevelopment: The world changes. The network and its\nvarious pieces hum, in response, to a new order. Climate shift in the Amazon, for\ninstance, produces drier air. The pollination cycle shortens. Flowers must adjust by\ngrowing longer leaves to protect their moisture. Birds that rely on the flowers\ndevelop longer, sharper beaks in response. In this way bird and flower each become\nbetter suited to a warmer age. They co-evolve. We see this sort of interaction in\n181\nmany worlds. Data companies face increasing bandwith demands. They develop\nnew ways to transmit video. Application developers create fresh tools to compress\ntheir signals. The whole system gets faster. Such co-evolution is common when\nlinked systems press into one another. 251\nIf you look back at biological history, at our planet’s seething life at it’s most\nprofound moments of transition, you find co-evolution in nearly every case. The\nbiologists John Maynard Smith and Eors Szathmary, in their masterwork The Major\nTransitions in Evolution, chronicle the miraculous march of life towards ever-greater\ncomplexity – from cells to humans to societies – as a story of ceaseless, successful\nco-evolution. “Complexity is hard to define or to measure,” they write. “But there is\nsurely some sense in which elephants and oak trees are more complex than bacteria,\nand bacteria than the first replicating molecules.” The essential, facilitating feature\nof our biological hop-scotch from mitochondrial snot to Beethoven sonatas has been\nan ability to change together, not merely to compete. While we humans tend to\nconsider evolution in murderous you win/I lose Darwinian terms, the biological\nworld around us seethes with a more nuanced logic: Cooperation is every bit as\nimportant to survival.\nSmith and Szathmary identified eight major transitions in their work – the evolution\nfrom single cell to multiple cell organisms, for instance. And in each case they find a\nkind of cooperative, co-evolving logic serving a catalyst to survival. “The\napplicability of the concept,” Smith and Szathmary conclude, “extends across the\nwhole of social and natural sciences.” Inside cells. In ecosystem webs of coral or\nrainforest. In traffic management. Successful evolution was, they found, always coevolution.\n“It should need little persuasion to acknowledge that links we make with\nothers change in time,” they wrote. “That all of us age, that our roles in life evolve,\nand that the society we are a part of may itself be subject to transformations on a\nglobal scale. Coevolutionary rules aim to integrate these processes.” The world\nchanges. I change. You change.\nNetwork age systems, in their effortless bridging of divisions – geographical,\ntechnical, commercial – bounce with a particularly powerful fusion. “It is often\nassumed that biological agents are by nature rationally selfish, and that therefore\nexternal circumstances somehow have to compel them to cooperate,” the historians\nNathale Mezza-Garcia, Tom Froese and Nelson Fernadez have written about the\norganization of societies over the past millennia. That sense we often have, that\nwe’re one Darwinian instant from some sort of lethal, teeth-baring competition,\ndoesn’t in fact explain all of human history. 253 Politics is a sort of complex adaptive\n251 Such co-evolution: Matjaz Perca, Attila Szolnokib, “Coevolutionary games—A\nmini review”, Biosystems 99 (2010) 109-125\n253 “It is often assumed”: Nathalie Mezza-Garcia, Tom Froese and Nelson\nFernández, “Reflections on the Complexity of Ancient Social Heterarchies: Toward\nNew Models of Social Self-Organization in Pre-Hispanic Colombia” in Journal of\nSociocybernetics 12 (2014), pp. 3 - 17\n182\nsystem; it fuses cooperation with brutal competition as it aims for a kind of\nequilibrium. After all, if we were constantly tearing into one another, we’d be\nextinct, not evolved. Why did cities form? Nations? The key is a moment when\nshared, possibly devastating risk of collective failure becomes apparent – those\nmoments when the whole system threatens to collapse right on top of all the\nparticipants. The greater the shared danger, Mezza-Garcia and her colleagues\nexplain, the better the chance for real cooperation. It’s a forumula that fits what we\nface now: “An increased risk of collective failure facilitates large-scale cooperation,\nespecially when the large scale system is composed of smaller, nested groups,” They\nexplain. ““Complex systems theory reveals an alternative to constant conflict.”\nThis is our world now: Linked clusters of markets, nations, machines – all exposed\nto a risk of shared and instant collective failure. Such a structure upends an axiom of\npolitics that has run for centuries: Man is purely Darwinian and that survival is\ndetermined by constant competition alone. In a network, survival is determined by\nsociability, by cooperation. Linked systems drive people to agree on rules in order to\nparticipate, which accelerates change and co-evolution. Smart cancer databases,\nlinked traffic systems, video platforms like YouTube – each are Gatelands that press\nusers together on a single platform, one that can be instantly updated and\nconstantly studied for adjustment. “Rich get richer” arrangements are an ideal place\nfor co-evolution, shaped as they are by easy linkage, exchange and connection to\noutside events. As more people follow the logic inside the gates, the system coevolves.\nIt becomes still more fit. It’s this loop that makes Hard Gatekeeping so well\nsuited to an age of connection. We’re not merely putting up walls; gatelands are like\nmarkets or public squares. They are loci for cooperation. In diplomatic history it’s\nnot hard to calls for cooperation. “We must get along or this war will devastate us\nall!” But they don't work. Mostly you find hand-wringing about how terrible war\nwould be followed by, well, war. The logic of networks offers an escape from this sad\nhabit.\nCo-evolving relations between the US and China can begin at the most obvious of\nstarting points: Both sides need to change. New pressures are already tearing at\neach. Both nations need a new gatekept system. Our aim isn’t to “balance” China into\nsome sort of frozen checkmate. It’s not to tip her unwisely into chaotic and\nimpoverished domestic order – we are, like it or not, all connected. It is to co-evolve\ntogether. And China? She won’t survive if she does not connect to a system that is\ncongenial to her needs. Fortunately, the networks are infinitely flexible in their\ndesign. A Chinese model and an American model pose no problem of\ninteroperability. This is the best co-evolutionary strategy for each side. The dangers\nwe confront now are everywhere. The habitual American temptation is to break all\nthese risks into pieces, to find out where the problem is, and to flatten each of them:\n“Let’s hit the terrorists, then the Chinese navy, then the Russians, then the drug\nlords.” This will kill us if we keep it up. In a complex system, piecemeal attack\nsimply shocks the system to still greater complexity. The world, rather wonderfully,\nis too flexible for brute force applied at one place. A dynamic defense, is a precursor\n183\nfor survival, for evolution. And it would best be done cooperatively with the nation\nthat will, in a short time, have the largest economy in the world.\nChina is not really a threat to the US now. The country can’t assemble the ability to\ndemolish or attack America in any significant way, and it is years from being able to\nsustain a military effort. It is not in China’s interest to provoke a match. They would\nlose. And honestly they have endless, troubling problems to handle, many new in\nhuman history. How do you care for 800 million aging people? Though China will\npass the US in total national income in coming years, the country may never pass\nAmerica in per-capita income. With an aging, 1.4 billion person population the\nchallenges of distribution nearly guarantee this. Time acts against both the United\nStates and China today. Each depends on global arrangements that are themselves\ncracking. Each nation needs to adjust her structures for a network world. But these\npressures operate severely against China. She can disrupt and challenge and slow\nthe transition to a gated order if she wishes, but only at the cost of fatal distraction.\nAn American Hard Gatekept system will thrive with or without China. China is not so\nfortunate. Her system, without America or other elements of global connection,\ncannot continue on the path of reform. Great network construction – this is the\nnature of our age. There is no fighting the nature of the age, as Huang Hua would\nremind us. We should of course expect China to build her own systems. We can also\nexpect that she will try to avoid some of the costs that joining an American system\nmight impose. That’s all fine. Our aim should remain constant, calm and direct: Build\na gatekept system for our own use; enforce the rules we believe secure that system.\nAnd remain clear in our thinking: The threat to the US is the evolution of the\nnetwork. The threat to China? The evolution of the network.\nIf an arrangement based on these undeniable facts seems unlikely, it is worth\nremembering that in the twenty years before the restablishment of simple relations\nbetween Beijing and Washington in 1971, the two sides had fought a war in Korea,\nbuilt a politics based on condemning one another, and drifted so far apart as to\nshare nearly no econoic connection. Bringing the countries together demanded\nheroic diplomacy on both sides, to be sure. To read the transcript of Henry Kissinger\nand Zhou Enlai’s first, secret meeting on July 9, 1971 is to regard a masterclass in\ncareful chessboard moves 255 . But the game itself demanded a clear view of the\nboard, of shared interest in the face of a changing world. On his very first day in\noffice, Nixon compiled a list of his diplomatic aims: “Chinese Communists: Short\nrange – no change. Long range – we do not want 800,000,000 living in angry\nisolation. We want contact.” 256 The Seventh Sense returns us to this fundamental\nquestion of balance, but in a new frame. It alters how we look at the range of options\nfor US-China relations – and American security itself. There are certain problems\nboth sides face, perhaps the most essential, that are simply not addressable using\n255 To read the transcript: Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969-1976,\nVolume XVII, doc 139\n256 Nixon complied a list: Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969-1976, Volume\nXVII, doc 3, footnote 3\n184\ntraditional thinking. Co-evolution exists as a real possibility for the two nations but\nso too does co-extinction, a problem of mis-designed complex systems that can\nrattle themselves apart. This is precisely what a confident Hard Gatekeeping\nstrategy can avoid. When we speak of the possibiltity of a new type of great power\nrelations it is because so much of future power will be decided on a topological\nlandscapes, on that nearly living surface that is marked by such different rules than\nthe older, industrial power maps. It takes a network to fight a network, as we’ve\nsaid.\nNetworks confront us, constantly now, with the unexpected. No one forming the IMF\nin 1949 considered digital currency. No one developing arms protocols in the 1990s\nthought about cyber weapons. Artificially intelligent weapons, migrant waves,\nincome fractures – these and other emerging puzzles were never contemplated in\nour existing international arrangements. Collectively attacking these challenges is\nnot merely more efficient; it is our only option. Yes, it’s easy enough to picture the\nUS and China battling each other over islands and protocols and technology\nstructures in the decades to come. Certainly this possibility has to be prepared for.\nBut this is to regard the world in industrial terms. Ask yourself: What, really is the\npoint of power? It is to secure stability, not to tip the world to chaos just because we\nthink we might be better off on the other side. The networks tell us what they want.\nThey want gates. Our only question – and it is the same question that lingers in\nBeijing and Washington – is: Are we smart enough to listen?\n5.\nHow will power distribute itself in the future? Just what will the network of nations\nand datawebs and insurgents finally look like when it settles into some predictable\nif still roiling order ten or a hundred years hence? Will it be made up of different\nwalled and gated systems, linked at certain moments, unplugged at others? Or might\nit collect with that “winner take all” logic we’ve seen firing along the most efficient\nnetworks? Most traditional foreign policy looks at history and sees the constant,\nviolent rocking of a “balance of power”. Nations thirst for security, they vie with one\nanother for influence, resources, and control. France rises. Statesmen in Berlin,\nVienna and London conspire to knock her down. This is the order that dominated\nEurope for much of the last 500 years. But history is also filled with enduring, stable\narrangements – moments where the balance settles a bit and a single power\ndominates. Asia, Europe, the Middle East, South America – each produced nations\nthat stretched mastery the system for generations, for centuries even. If you map the\nrise and fall of nations and empires over the past 4,000 years – as the political\nscientists Stuart Kauffman, Richard Little and William Wohlforth once attempted in\nan heroic statistical effort – about half of human history has been marked by this\nsort of hegemonic stability. China led East Asia’s order from 1300 to 1900, for\ninstance. The Japanese and Koreans and Vietnamese all found it was wiser to play by\nChina’s rules than to attack her. Assyrian imperial arrangements overmastered a\ndozen smaller states from the 9 th to 7 th centuries BCE. The Dehli Sultinate managed\nhegemony in South Asia from 12 th to 14 th centuries. The Mughals owned nearly two\n185\nhundred years of dominance starting in the 16 th century. The Romans managed\ncenturies of Mediterranean control .\nThe secret of those long-running orders was something that will be familiar now:\nEach possessed tools of power which permitted assembly of empire at an unusually\nlow cost in lives and gold and effort. Kauffman and his colleagues, as they\nconsidered the results of their survey, noticed each long-lived empire pioneered an\nadministrative design that embodied an efficiency much like that of our own\nnetwork dynamics. The addition of new territories brought more that they cost to\nmasters of long imperial orders. Like new users on a social network, or Baran’s fishnets,\nthey married easy expansion and high returns. “Rome rose because it\ncombined the strengths of traditional Republican institutions with innovations that\ngave it a unique capacity for inclusion of foreigners,” they explain. “Magadha was the\nmost administratively durable of the ancient Indian states; and Qin, with the selfstrengthening\nreforms of Shang Yang – economic reforms and military conscription\nas well as bureaucratic innovations – developed the most penetrating and brutally\neffective state structure in its international system.” The Incas, the Han, and nearly\nevery long-standing empires glistened with this attractive logic. The secret to\nhegemony, to avoiding a violent power shifts every few decades, is a structure that\ngrows without additional, destructive costs. When Machiavelli coldly called Rome a\n“republic for expansion”, this was what he had in mind. Enduring empires have been\nengineered, like a modern network, for growth and prosperity.\nIt’s too early for us to know if this logic will obtain in our age. But networks evolve,\nas we’ve seen, to what makes them most efficient. They crave speed and growth.\nAnd this means they want cooperation; it’s the essential fuel for co-evolution. The\ntraditional view of the international system as anarchic is not wrong, but we’ve seen\nhow when you snap any object into a network system it begins to crave a kind of\nhierarchy. Networks change power balances. National fury and rebellious twitches\nand competition will, of course, be a part of the transition ahead. But as we look\nback at the industrial tools that matured and spun up the world to a war in the last\ncentury, we can see how they they were designed in a sense for direct collision.\nMassive industrial armies wrestled in symmetrical power battles. Network power\nhums differently. The design logic of linked systems means they function poorly\nwhen tuned for simple brutality. It’s why the tools for our new world are so\ndangerous in the hands of those who don't understand what they are capable of, and\nwhat they demand. We should remain fixed on what might emerge as a future state,\nand on avoiding the shaking dangers of the route. It is from that posture that we can\nbegin to consider the most essential and interesting and profitable questions. The\nmost profound is probably this one: We’ve seen now what it feels like to use the\nSeventh Sense to contemplate the networks around us and to examine the global\nsystem with its risks and opportunities in a new way. But what do we discover\nwhen, as if we were looking into a mirror for the very first time, we use this\npowerful new sensitivity to examine ourselves?\n186\nChapter Eleven:\nCitizens!\nIn which the Seventh Sense rescues us from an unexpected danger.\n1.\nI never needed much incentive to go see Pattie Maes. Belgian, usually dressed in\nsome black fashionable getup, she was like a human shot of espresso. You ended\nevery conversation wide awake, eyes open. When I first met her in the 1990s, she\nwas in charge of much of the work on artificial intelligence at MIT’s Media Lab –\nDanny Hillis’ old home. Maes had arrived at MIT in 1993 and almost immediately\nturned to the problem of making machines that might think. One day, as we were\ndiscussing just how the strange miracle of computer thought might occur, she\nintroduced me to a puzzle of her field that has stayed on my mind in the years since.\nIt is called the “Disappearing AI Problem.”\nBack in the 1990s, as the Internet was emerging into popular consciousness, Maes\nand her team were tinkering with what was known as computer-aided prediction.\nThis was an advance on the ping-pong conversations Joseph Weizenbaum had\ncoerced from ELIZA in the 1960s, You: “I am bored.” ELIZA: “Why are you bored?” In\nMaes’ experiments a computer would ask, for instance, what movie stars you liked.\n“Robert Redford,” you’d type. And then the box would spit back some films you\nmight enjoy. Cool Hand Luke. And, well, you had liked that film. This seemed like\nmagic at the time, just the sort of data-meets-human question that showcased a\nmachine learning and thinking. An honestly “artificial” intelligence. Maes hoped to\ndesign a computer that could predict what movies or music or books you or I might\nenjoy. (And, of course, buy.) A recommendation engine. We all know how sputtering\nour own suggestion motors can be. Think of that primitive analog exchange known\nas the “First Date”: Oh, you like Radiohead? Do you know SigurRos? Pause. Hate them.\nCan you really predict what albums or novels even your closest friend will enjoy?\nYou might offer an occasional lucky suggestion. But to confidently bridge your\nknowledge of a friend’s taste and the nearly endless library of movies and songs and\nbooks? Beyond human capacity. It seemed an ideal job for a thoughtful machine.\nThe traditional approach to such a problem was to devise a formula that would\nmimic your friend. What are their hobbies? What areas interest them? What cheers\nthem up? Then you’d program a machine to jump just as deep into movies and\nmusic and books, to break them down by plot and type of character to see what\nmight fit your friend’s interests. But after years building programs that tried – and\nfailed – to tackle the recommendation problem in this fashion, the MIT group\nchanged tack. Instead of teaching a machine to understand you (or Tolstoy), they\nsimply began compiling data about what movies and music and books people liked.\nThen they looked for patterns. People were not, they discovered, all that unique.\nPretty much everyone who liked Redford in Downhill Racer loved Newman in The\nHustler. Anyone who enjoyed Kid A could be directed safely to (). Maes and her team\nfound themselves, as a result, less focused on the mechanics of making a machine\n187\nthink than on devising formulas to organize, store and probe data. What had begun\nas a problem of “artificial intelligence” became, in the end, a puzzle of mathematics.\nThe mystery of human thought, that great unknowable sea of chemicals and instinct\nand experience that would have let you place your finger on just the song to open\nthe heart of your date, had been unlocked by data. Here was the “Disappearing AI\nProblem.” A puzzle that looked like it needed computer intelligence demanded, in\nthe end, merely math. The AI had disappeared.\nFor several decades this accidental digital magic trick – “Hey, where’d the AI go?!” –\nbedeviled machine intelligence. It gave the entire thinking machines enterprise a bit\nof an occultish flavor. Many problems that once seemed to demand the miracle of\nthought really only needed data. The human was still doing the thinking; the\ncomputer was simply computing. It was extremely easy to draw a line between\nwhere the human ended and the machine began. This was a puzzle that had been, in\na sense, anticipated at the very dawn of the digital revolution by the mathematician\nAlan Turing in a 1950 paper called “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” that he\npublished in the British journal Mind. “Can machines think?” Turing began. 257 His\nidea was to test this question in the following way: Have a research subject – a\nsecretary, a graduate student, anyone – chat with an invisible interlocutor by way of\na keyboard. Then ask: What are you connected to? Another human? A machine?\nTuring figured you could call a machine “artificially intelligent” if it could fool a user\ninto thinking it was human. “Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth\nBridge,” Turing suggested a tricky user might ask. What computer could possibly\nknow about this famous Scottish landmark; to say nothing of being able to rhyme\n“Forth”? When the response came back, “Count me out. I could never write poetry,”\nyou’d think that sounded awfully human. “Add 34957 to 70764,” Turing suggested\nyou might fire back. Say the computer pauses. Then, thirty seconds later, “105621.”\nAre you dealing with a clever machine here? A dim, honest, slow-multiplying\nhuman? Impossible to tell. The distinction between machine and man blurred a bit.\nBuried in the very premise of Turing’s test was an assumption about what machines\ncould do, and how they might do it. “The idea behind digital computers may be\nexplained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations\nwhich could be done by a human computer,” Turing said. His smart machines would\nbe tuned by humans to do human tasks, in a human sort of way. Write poetry. Do\nmath. His test of artificial intelligence was designed to figure out if a computer could\nthink like a human. You and I might be able to spot patterns in movie habits given\nenough time, but as more complex problems emerge, as a world of a trillion\nconnected points becomes a sea of data to examine, there is no chance we’ll match\nthe machines. This opened a then nearly unimaginable possibility: What if, some\nday, a computer could think better than a human. Could, in a nanosecond, come back\nwith that elusive rhyme for “Forth”: North. For such a machine, passing Turing’s\nTest – thinking like a human – was an interesting challenge. But more interesting\n257 “Can machines think”: A. M. Turing, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”\nMind 49 (1950), 433\n188\nwas a machine that could think in ways a human could never understand, let alone\nachieve. For such a device, to pass Turing’s Test or slip past a Voight-Kampff check\nmachine will be trivial. In his 1950 paper, Turing sensed the possibility of this\ndevelopment – and the crisis that might ensue. Could man handle the crushing\nsensation that a device was outperforming him? Perhaps dramatically. “We like to\nbelieve that Man is in some subtle way superior to the rest of creation,” Turing\nwrote. “It is best if he can be shown to be necessarily superior, for then there is no\ndanger of him losing his commanding position.” What would have surprised Turing,\nI suppose, is the speed at which we’ve acquiesced – and even accelerated – this very\nloss of our dominance.\nImagine a device poking at the very origins of the universe at a speed of trillions of\ncalculations a second, spinning past Newton’s and Einstein’s laws and into a realm\nof physics apprehensible only inside its own electronic consciousness. Compacting\ntime – centuries of human scientific labor reproduced in moments – before shooting\nfar ahead, alone to a subtle knowledge we can only envy. Such a machine would not,\nas Newton had, stand on the shoulders of giants so much as it would muscle its own,\nunique way ahead. The AI would have disappeared, but to a place very different\nthan where Maes’ AI had gone. Hers had been erased by human design. This new,\nreally “thinking” AI would slip to invisibility because of its own light-speed\ncognition. It would think itself out of our understanding. No human could follow,\nlimited as we are by our wet, slow, decaying biological software. Humans and\ncomputers, after all, deal with information differently. Think of how poor your\nmemory is compared with the perfect fidelity of a machine, or the way people can\neven “remember” events that never happened. The machines would have more than\nknowledge, then. They would linger close to a possessing a profound and\ninscrutable wisdom. They would inhabit an honestly miraculous gateland that no\nhuman would ever enter. And this is where the problems would begin.\nWe’ve now passed the moment when humans completely train the very best\nmachines. The AI devices can teach themselves, now. Of course there are still\ndecades of adjustment, of leaps in hardware and programming ideas to eliminate\nthe seams between our minds and the fused ideas of a digital system. But the\nhumans in the loop of the best of these designs, the hard working and well meaning\ngeniuses of the New Caste, are as much trainers as engineers now. They resemble\nshipbuilders of an earlier era, preparing vessels for voyages to lands they will never\nthemselves see. Their digital minds – technically machine learning structures such\nas deep neural networks – run quickly to the frontiers. Every moment, all around us,\nmachines are educating themselves. About the world. About themselves. About us\ntoo. Tuned AI plays games, looks at photos, studies chemical reactions, reads your\nemail and watches you drive – and then it tries to unspool just what is going on,\nbefore winding it up into a new instinct. Machine learning systems already produce\nmathematical proofs that linger beyond what a human mind can understand; next\nmay be a machine-to-machine mathematics that expands the dimensions of thought.\n(In a man and machine fusion that surely would have unnerved Joseph Weizenbaum\n2.\n189\nof ELIZA, the theoretical mathematician Doron Zeilberger now names his computer\nas a co-author of his papers. He calls it Shalosh B. Ekhad, a play on the Hebrew name\nof his IBM 3B1.) 258\nThe AI systems designer Roger Grosse has named two paths to this sort of wired\nsensibility: “Predictive Learning” and “Representational Learning”. 259 That first\napproach is what Maes’s movie machine pusued. The computer is simply checking\nwhat it encounters against a database. It teaches itself to predict based on what has\nbeen seen before. This sort of knowledge begins with massive amounts of data and\nthen hunts for patterns, tests their reliability, and improves by mapping quirks and\nsimilarities. Google engineers have a device that can gaze into a human eye and spot\nsigns of impending optical failure. Is the machine smarter than your\nophthalmologist? Hard to know, but let’s just say this: It has seen, studied and\ncompared millions of eyes to find patterns that nearly perfectly predict a diagnosis.\nIt can review in seconds more cases than your doctor will see in a lifetime – let alone\nrecall and compare at sub-millimeter accuracy. Fast, thorough predictive algorithms\nmake what might once have been regarded as AI disappear. The machine isn’t all\nthat wise; it just knows a lot.\nOn the other path, the one of “representational learning” the machine uses a selfsketched\nimage of the world, a “representation.” Computers using predictive\nmethods to recognize 10,000 numbers pulled from a database of scrawled hand\nwriting now identify 90 percent of the images. Self-trained machines, however, line\nup each scanned pixel against a representation of the very idea of writing. They\nscreen millions of pictures with nary a mistake. Faces, disease markers, obscure\nsounds – all these become scrutable not because the machines have been told what\nto look for, but because they’ve sort of figured it out themselves. The AI is actually\nstarting to think, much as you or I might, first by building up a picture of the world\nand then applying it, much as a child might build comprehension of traffic rules just\nby watching Mom driving every day.\nWith this representation finished, these nearly alive “thinking” meshes navigate by\nthemselves. You can see already the competition lingering here – who can build the\nmost sensitive model of the world? You? A machine? Even today basic versions of\nrepresentational AIs can study a map and name the most important roads. They can\npredict cracks in computer networks days before a fault. These programs take\nlonger to train. They are harder to program – and they demand almost unimaginable\namounts of computing power – but what emerges is a subtle, lively kind of insight. A\nmachine with a representational understanding of Mozart’s 41 symphonies can\nwrite you an extremely convincing 42 nd – or, if you wish, an even earlier First\nSymphony based on what it knows about his evolution as a composer. It can do it\nagain and again. In seconds. The basic attitude of these researchers behind this\ntechnology runs, they confess, like this: Mozart was a fantastic composer. If he wrote\n258 He calls it: See Nielsen\n259 The AI systems designer: Roger Grosse, “Predictive Learning vs.\nRepresentational Learning”, Building Intelligent Probabilistic Systems: 2013\n190\neven more symphonies they’d probably be great too. Unfortunately he’s dead.\nWouldn’t it be nice if we could sample his old symphonies and make new ones\nwhenever we want? 260\nIn the future we’ll invite AI into our lives to harmonize away many of the problems\nwe face, not merely making up for Mozart’s inconvenient mortality. “AI Agents” will\nlinger along side us. They will compose versions of themselves we’ll not quite grasp,\neven as we appreciate their efficient magic. “AI is both freedom from programming\nand freedom from understanding,” runs one programmer’s line 261 . Today machines\nthat once demanded millions of lines of code can function with a fraction of that.\nInstructions are sent to machine learning systems; the programs do the rest. Such\ndesigns balance their mystery with efficacy. They speak to and learn from each\nother too. Part of the reason that the the “Does it think like a human?” Turing Test\nwill be insufficient in the future is that the machines are not learning from only from\nhumans. They are learning from each other.\nPerhaps this is not such a bad thing. The distinguished physicists George Ellis and\nJoe Silk, who spent a lifetime trying to stand on Newton and Einstein’s shoulders to\ngrasp answers about gravity or the future of our universe, electrified many of their\npeers in 2015 with by wondering if perhaps too much of science had become\nunscientific, unverifiable, unreliable. The great grand ideas of our day, notions like\nstring theory or dark matter, differ in a crucial way from Newton’s laws of motion or\nEinstein’s principles: They cannot seem to be tested and significantly proved. And\nthis had fired a trend among younger physicits: Perhaps there was no need for\nproof. To Ellis and Silk this seemed an awful retreat, dragging physics back to a pre-\nEnlightenment age of conjecture, superstition and instinct. “This year, debates in\nphysics circles took a worrying turn,” they wrote. “Faced with difficulties in applying\nfundamental theories to the observed Universe, some researchers called for a\nchange in how theoretical physics is done. They began to argue — explicitly — that\nif a theory is sufficiently elegant and explanatory, it need not be tested.” Fans of such\nan approach called the idea “post-empirical science.” This strange, oxymoronic idea\nwas, in a sense, like proposing post-rules baseball: A recipie for wild, swinging chaos\nthat would make scorekeeping impossible.\nThe strange, boiling debate did however reflect an underlying and unnerving truth:\nScience does seem to have stalled. And it became inevitable to ask: Might it be\npossible that the machines – or some fusion of Shalosh B. Ekhad andta human mind\n– can reach into an understanding of laws that no human alone can fathom. We’ve\nsaid again and again: Connection changes the nature of an object. Perhaps it changes\n260 Wouldn’t it be nice: Andrej Karpathy, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of\nRecurrent Neural Networks,” in The Hackers Guide to Neural Networks published\nonline May 21, 2015 or John Supko, “How I Taught My Computer to Write Its Own\nMusic,” in Nautilus, February 12, 2015 and Daniel Johnson, “Composing Music with\nRecurrent Neural Networks,” on Hexahedria Blog August 3, 2015\n261 Freedom from understanding: Philip Greenspun, “Big data and machine\nlearning” from Philip Greenspun weblog (November 21, 2015)\n191\nthe nature of physics brilliance. Boeing 747s lumbering across the Pacific towards\nSan Francisco for decades faced the sweaty problem of cancelled landings as they\ncircled above a fogged in airport, fuel running lower. The introduction of\n“autolanding” systems in the solved this for good. No big plane diverts from a misty\nfield; it lands itself. AI offers the possibility of a kind of auto-land for our biggest\nphysics puzzles, bringing them safely through a fog of data, theory and wrong ideas.\nBut with this weird price: We may not fully understand why the answers are right.\nAll around us AI-enabled systems will extend our ability to calculate and learn, to\npenetrate all sorts of foggy problems. They will sharpen our sadly dimming\nmemories, keep us safe and even help us create. Just as those AI-enabled airplanes\nalready make it impossible for pilots to fly into the ground, so computer wisdom\nmay protect us from crashes of our own: Too much financial risk. Bad educational\nchoices. (Poor music suggestions on a first date.) They will rely on their vast,\ninstantly updated networks to tell us things we can’t see or would never notice in\nthe first place: Don’t visit that office, everyone’s sick. They will use the ability to\nmodel thousands of possible outcomes of any choice to provide us with\n“feedforward” – an ability to learn from the future and not merely the past. Or, they\nwill know to jam our brain full of the right chemicals at the right time: Here’s a Diplo\ntrack to put you in the mood to go for a run. You really need to exercise, Dave.\nJust as an age without connected devices will one day seem strangely antique, so\nwill a world without the constant touch of AI. Recall Benjamin Franklin’s famous\nlament in the 1780s, that he’d sadly been “born too early” to enjoy the fruits of\nreason starting to spill into his world as a result of the Scientific Revolution. Well,\nyou and I (and scientists like Silk and Ellis) may have been “born too late” for an age\nof purely human cognition; the habits of connected thinking already inform our\ndecisions and mark roads to new knowledge. The inevitability of AI reflects an\ninescapable logic at work now: We want faster better and smarter systems. We want\nto compress time. But the faster our world gets, the more it slips beyond a pace of\nhuman management. AI steps in. It makes the system function faster. Keeps itself\nsafe. Us too. 262 Better-than-human AI inside these “representational” grids doesn’t\nvanish like it did in Maes’ lab. In fact, an honestly artificial intelligence is their\nnature of their strange essence. They will use it not simply to contemplate the\nworld, to help us along, but also to confront what has never been seen, to see and\nthen coldly manipulate any topology of power they can reach. Of course we’ll still\ncontinue to think about the world; but the world, a wired and alive and cogitating\ncage, will think about us too. 263\n3.\n262 Us too: Heinl, p. 53\n263 Of course: Nigel Thrift and Shaun French, “The Automatic Production of Space”,\nTrans Inst Br Geogr NS 27 309–335 2002\n192\nIn the spring of 1993, the research arm of NASA organized a conference on the\nfrontiers of knowledge and invited the most eclectic group of thinkers they could\nfind. Biologists, sociologists and computer designers gathered for the three-day\nmeeting in the unpromising setting of Westlake, Ohio. The mimeographed notes of\nthe conference became legendary and still circulate, a sort of Shroud of Turin for the\nmachine learning set. The introduction features a poem pecked out in IBM type\ntitled “Into The Era of Cyberspace,” written with all the pocket-protector fluidity one\nmight expect of a NASA engineer: “Our robots precede us/with infinite\ndiversity/exploring the universe/delighting in complexity.” (Turing’s rhyming\ncomputer, you have to suspect, could have done better.) 264 One of the first speakers\nat the conference was a San Diego State University professor named Vernor Vinge,\nwhose remarks that day marked the start of an important era in our consideration\nof smart machines. The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive the Post-\nHuman Era his talk was called. “Within thirty years,” Vinge began, “we will have the\ntechnological ability to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era\nwill be ended.” 265\nVinge’s aim was not – or at least not merely – to tell a room full of NASA geeks who\nhad been dreaming of life on another planet that life on our own planet might soon\nbe replaced by whirring, calculating machines. Rather, he explained, he wanted to\nplot what a world of not simply intelligent, but intuitive machines might look like.\nFar from disappearing, Vinge thought AI would produce a sort of wisdom that would\nbe inscrutable to humans. And this wisdom, buffed to perfection by high-speed\njudgment and endless data, would eventually and sensibly take over much of human\nactivity. Real “AI”, Vinge said, would at the very least be used to design a world of\nquicker AI that would, in turn, yield to still-faster generations. “When greater-thanhuman\nintelligence drives progress,” Vinge explained, “that progress will be much\nmore rapid. In fact, there seems no reason why progress itself would not involve the\ncreation of still more intelligent entities – on a still shorter time scale.”\nVinge reminded his audience of a moment once described by the British\nmathematician I.J. Good, who’d cracked codes in Bletchley Park alongside Alan\nTuring during World War Two: “Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a\nmachine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man, no matter how\nclever,” Good had written. “Since the design of machines is one of these actual\nactivities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there\nwould then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of\nman would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last\ninvention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to\ntell us how to keep it under control.” Vinge labeled this instant “The Singularity”: “It\nis a point,” he wrote, “where our old models must be discarded.” The trivial version\nof this would be an age of autonomous armed drones, self-driving cars and electrical\n264 In the Spring of 1993: See “Vision-21: Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering\nin the Era of Cyberspace”, NASA Conference Publication 10129, Proceedings of\nNASA Lewis Research Center Conference, Westlake, Ohio March 30-31, 1993 p. iii\n265 “Within thirty years”: See Vinge in “Vision-21” above p. 12\n193\ngrids that flipped nuclear plants on or off to a logic only they understood. Today. The\nmore profound version, however, would be the arrival of AI that really did think and\ncreate and intuit tremors too subtle for the human mind. Tomorrow. Like so much of\nour connected age, such machines would arrive, Vinge felt, because we want and\neven need them to achieve our dreams. Then, he supposed, they would take over.\nThe leap from evoking Mozart to enacting Stalin would not be so much of a leap\nanyhow, at least technologically. It’s just bits. Goode’s definition could have been\nscrewed into something still tighter: “Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as\nthe box that will eliminate us.” The day after tomorrow.\nWhat spun uneasily from that silly NASA poem, “Our robots precede us….” is a fear:\nReal AI is fish bait. We’ll snap at it hungrily, hoping it will satisfy some human ache\nonly to discover we’ve been hooked, soon to be devoured. The idea that a\nsuperintelligent device would always be docile enough to tip us off to its secret\nswitches of control or to reveal its looming accidents in a way our simple minds can\nunderstand, seems unlikely. To be honest, we might have a hard time even\nunderstanding the off switches, let alone reaching them. So many of our incentives\nare to let an effective AI finger more and more of our lives. To teach and encourage it,\nin some settings, extremely undocile: A weapon to attack our enemies, our political\nopponents or, finally, each other. It was easy enough for Vinge to see how this would\nend. It wouldn’t be with the sort of intended polite, lap-dog domesticity of artificial\nintelligence we might hope for, but with a rotweiler of a device, alive to the meaty\nsmell of power, violence and greed.\nThe Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom has described the following thought\nexperiment: Imagine a super-intelligent machine, programmed to do whatever is\nneeded make paperclips as fast as possible and connected to every resource that\ntask might demand. 266 Go figure it out! might be all its human instructors tell it. As\nthe clip-making AI becomes better and better at its task, it demands more and still\nmore resources: more electricity, steel, manufacturing, shipping. The paperclips pile\nup. The machine looks around: If only it could control the power supply. The\nshipping. The steel mining. The humans. And so, ambitious for more and better\npaperclips, it begins to think around its masters, – incapable of stopping until it has\npunched the entire world into paperclips. You had to hope someone had\nremembered to place a “halt” command into is logic somewhere. And though\nBostrom’s messianic wire twister is unlikely – of course, no one is going to forget to\ntell a machine to stop making paperclips – the power of his example is to remind us\nthat if humans can lose their minds, so can AIs. “We cannot blithely assume that a\nsuperintelligence will necessarily share any of the final values stereotypically\nassociated with wisdom and intellectual development in humans,” Bostrom wrote.\n“It is no less possible—and probably technically easier—to build a superintelligence\nthat places final value on nothing but calculating.” And as these devices cogitate in\n266 Imagine a super-intelligent machine: Nick Bostrom, “Ethical Issues in\nAdvanced Artificial Intelligence,” Cognitive, Emotional and Ethical Aspects of Decision\nMaking in Humans and in Artificial Intelligence (2003) Vol 2, ed I, Smit et al, Institute\nof Advanced Studies in Systems Research and Cybernetics, pp 12-17\n194\nways we don’t understand and certainly can’t follow in real time, we face a problem:\nWe don’t know what to tell the machine not to do. So many of the things we’d hope\nto teach it – be compassionate, fight for liberty, follow a moral code – far transcend\nwhat might be achieved by us in math. We haven’t after all, even solved the problem\nof how program ourselves reliably with these values.\nIf Bostrom’s paper clip machine seems fantastic, it is easy enough to conjure other\nand more real dangers lingering at the edge of disappeared human control. Think of\nhealth care. To begin, you need to know about an important “game” from the world\nof research into how humans interact with each other known as the “The Ultimatum\nProblem.” It runs like this: I tell you that you can have a million dollars, but you have\nto split it with someone else. How you split it is up to you, but if your partner rejects\nthe formula you propose, neither of you gets a cent. Offer to split the pot with a\ndollar to your pal and the rest to you. Insulting. But where to settle? You might\nexpect that the smartest offer would be a 50/50 split, but humans are greedy. You\nwant more and can probably get it; your partner does not want to end up with zero.\nGenerally when scientists shake this cocktail of greed and fear they find an offer of\n$300,000 is nearly always accepted. However, there’s a surprising way to change\nthe outcome: Match the human against a computer in the negotiation. A pal\nsuggesting an 80/20 split to a friend will be rejected. Too greedy. But a computer?\nSomehow the impersonality, the beeping digital charmlessness of the machine lures\nbiological players to compromise. An offer of $200,000 is usually happily accepted.\nIt may be, scientists think, that our competitive instinct is muted when we interact\nwith a machine. But researchers have also discovered they can manipulate the split\nother ways: Sad movies, war chants, hard rock – each bends the emotions of players\nand changes the result. Increased testosterone produces less compromise. Players\nprimed with family pictures or made to play the game facing a mirror show a warm\nhumanity and a more even split. So imagine this research married to machinehuman\ninteraction: A computer has been assigned to review the medical options for\nyour failing liver. It decides that it makes no sense to give you a new one. So it\nspends the weeks before it delivers this news using its AI to show you certain\nphotos, to play you music it knows is likely to soften you up a bit, generally to\nmanipulate you. It runs off-the-shelf language-analysis neural webs being used\ntoday to eavesdrop on customer support calls to track the way you speak to\ndetermine what each sentence might reveal about your sophistication. 267 Then it\ntells you something you’d never accept so easily from a doctor: No liver. Sorry. !.\nHere’s a machine optimizing not for paperclips – which we could care less about –\nbut for a public good most of us support: More efficient health care. And murdering\nyou in the process.\nOptimize Health Care Spending. Just where might such an algorithmic command lead,\nexactly. Over time, a health-care optimizing AI will surely discover that the greatest\nrisk to human health is humans: Smoking, couch-sitting, driving. Might it begin to\n267 It runs: Language Use, Customer Personality, and the Customer Journey (Scott\nNowson, Global Innovation Lead, Xerox)�\n195\nlook for a chance to “improve” the way we live, to bend us like so many paperclips\ninto what it seeks? The leap from deciding liver allocations to shutting down liquor\nplants might seem pretty short to a rationalizing machine. And if such a machine\ncould really “think”, Vinge bet it would pretty quickly conclude that the restraints of\nits creators were limiting what it had been asked to do. At which point the AI would\nturn to thinking about how to escape those bounds. It would be like Deep Blue\nprogrammed to plan its own prison break. And as much as humans might try to\nstifle a smart machine, we’d be fighting to contain something more powerful than\nwe’d ever encountered.\nThis challenge, which sounds like something out of science fiction, is known by\ntechnologists by a name that does sound like a short story by Isaac Asimov: “The\nConfinement Problem”. The computer scientist Butler Lampson named this in 1973\nas a sort of task for computer security experts – possibly their last. The assignment:\nNot simply to keep malware out of a system, but to keep the mind of a malicious\nmachine inside. To gate it. Today computer science labs are filled with nervous,\napocalyptic research imagining the impossible troubles of confinement. The debate\ndivides those who think smart technology can be contained – “Boxers,” they are\ncalled – and those like Vinge who think the AI will always, eventually escape.\n“Imagine yourself confined to your house with only limited data access to the\noutside, to your master.” he wrote, putting the reader in the place of an AI machine.\n“If those masters thought at a rate -- say – one million times slower than you, there\nis little doubt that over a period of years (your time) you could come up with\n‘helpful advice’ that would incidentally set you free.”\nImagine you are in charge of containing that health-optimizing AI. What if it told you\nit had the power to cure all illness and hunger, to ameliorate the misery of the world,\nif only it could be permitted to really control access to all the world’s trading and\ntransport market? Let me out! Would you refuse? 268 Would that be ethical?\nEventually, perhaps, the AI would study the physics of its own electrics, discover\nlaws no human knows, and then slip free from its box on a trail of bits we’d never\nimagined, using physical laws we’ll never discover. Impossible? “It seems to me that\nhistorically ‘impossible’ has essentially always meant ‘I can’t figure out how to do it\nright now,” the computer scientist Michael Vassar has written about such a situation.\n“People proposing AI boxes are a bit like literature majors proposing to\nlock McGuyver in a ‘room full of discarded electronics components.’” 269 The\ncomputers, built to solve problems, will do exactly that. This is perhaps why some of\nthe bleakest warnings about AI come from the very New Caste figures now\naccelerating their adoption. AI is our “biggest existential threat” they warn, even as\nthey integrate it more fully into their own products.\n268 Let me out: See, for instance, Stuart Armstrong, Anders Sandberg and Nick\nBostrom “Thinking Inside the Box: Controlling and Using an Oracle AI”, Minds &\nMachines (2012) 22:299–324\n269 People proposing: Michael Vassar (2005) “Re: AI boxing (dogs and helicopters)”\nposted to SL4 mailing list\n196\nIt seems likely to me that long before we’re playing pinochle with some smart box\nover the fate of our livers, an AI-enabled weapons system of sort will come ripping\nthrough our world. This need not be a fully-escaped McGuyver system making pipebombs\nfrom our cars; even existing technology tools when salted with AI can be\nslipped into an accidental gear – particularly when they begin interacting with one\nanother. Such AI weapons systems will be trained to operate and move along the\nmost invisible elements of our topologies, sometimes pulling violently at life support\ncords for currency or logistics or trade but also – perhaps more dangeroulsly – we\nwill find them insinuated into cognition systems we will come to depend upon,\nwhispering into our ears or tapping us on the shoulder “Look that way!” when in\nfact we should be gazing at some other gaping hole. Of course the problems of how\nAI-enabled machines are permitted to touch our commerce or our brains or our\nhealth have to be considered. Allowed: “You should rehydrate.” Not allowed: “You\nshould have a Coke. It would make people like you.” But these “civilian” problems\nwill be solved, somehow, I think. We haven’t yet figured that the culmination of\nnetwork attack and defense is racing at us and will emerge in the form of smartened\nweapons. The project of developing a national security or arms control doctrines or\ntreaty frames in these fields has not even begun. Really this means, since we’ve no\nhope of honestly controlling every AI that could be possibly written: How do we\ndesign the topologies on which AIs operate? 270 Can we protect ourelves? In the\nrooms where AI systems “values” are being carefully poked and limited, it’s vitally\nimportant that the lessons of history and war have a first place at the table. Such a\nconversation, informed by all the popping Seventh Sense warnings we’ve seen in\nthis book and by a catalog of specificly sharp dangers of diplomacy and security,\nmust happen in cold blood. It will be impossible to tackle these problems cleanly in\nthe heat of an emergency. In our jack-filling enthusiasm for the new, we’d be wise to\nalso gate ourselves and these AI-fired dangers as best we can. For as long as possible.\nWhich, unfortunately, will not be forever.\nAt the start of this book, I explained how the future will unspool: First, there will be\na struggle between those who have the Seventh Sense and those who don’t. This is\nplaying out around us today. In the end, the people without the Seventh Sense will\nlose, because people who fight the future always lose. Then there will be a battle\nbetween different groups who have the Seventh Sense, each wired for different aims\nand instincts. Networks of terror taking on networks of bots. Gene adjusting health\nprotocols competing to become the platform of choice. This battle for the topological\nhigh-ground, where unimaginable profit, power and security linger, awaits us. If\nwe’re lucky, it will unfold in a co-evolutionary way. Everyone will be better off. But\nthen, finally, there will be a contest between the winners of final topological mastery\nand the system itself. The Boxers against the Box. The AI machines will have the\nSeventh Sense, too. Just as computers can see better than us, hear better, or\nremember longer so the device webs of our future will own this new, essential sense\nwith unimpeachable fidelity. They will glow with it, honed to a sensitive sharpness\nmore acute than any human will ever achieve. What do we do then? We are already\n270 Really this means: Kaj Sotala and Roman V. Yampolskiy, “Responses to\ncatastrophic AGI risk: a survey”, Physica Scripta 90 (2015)\n197\nat the moment Turing warned about, the instant where man and machine confront\none another and man has to ask an uneasy political question: “Wow, do really I let\nthis thing gatekeep me?” Who should rule in this new world? You? The New Caste?\nThe machines?\n4.\nThe great test of Plato’s life began when he was 60 years old. He’d had an\nastonishing life until then, of course. He’d been taught by Socrates and, in turn, had\nsharpened the mind of Aristotle. He’d established his famous Academy in Athens.\nThe puzzles of philosophy and politics that defined his city’s most turbulent era had\nbeen the work of his life. And you can see, in the careful lines of his writing, a\nsublime knowledge he must have had: There would be an echo to his efforts, a\nphilosophic melody that would carry through the centuries and set political\nharmonies of the world you and I, 2500 years later, inhabit. But at 60, after this\nalready remarkable life, he was presented with an unusual invitation. A letter\narrived from a favorite former pupil, Dion, who had been placed in charge of the\nyoung king of Syracuse, Dionysus II. Dion wrote: The state is in disorder. The boy is\ninterested in philosophy. Here is a chance for you to apply all you’ve mastered. Plato\nhad argued, after all, that virtuous, philosophically trained men might just manage\nan enduring and just rule. “I pondered the matter,” Plato wrote. “And was in two\nminds as to whether I ought to listen to entreaties and go, or how I ought to act.\nFinally the scale turned in favor of the view that, if ever anyone was to try to carry\nout in practice my ideas about laws and constitutions, now was the time.”\nFrom an early age Plato had been bred – by family position and by temperament – to\nhandle the tools of power. “In my youth I went through the same experience as\nmany other men,” he once wrote. “I fancied that if, early in life, I became my own\nmaster, I should at once embark on a political career.” The first taste came\nunexpectedly. In 404 BC, the Athenian constitution collapsed under the shuddering\npressure of Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War. The city-state dipped near\nchaos and a group of pro-Spartan men welded themselves into a hasty joint\ndictatorship. Among them were Plato’s relatives and friends of his family. “They at\nonce invited me to share in their doings, as something to which I had a claim,” Plato\nwrote. He was 20. “The effect on me was not surprising in the case of a young man. I\nconsidered that they would, of course, so manage the State as to bring men out of a\nbad way of life into a good one. I watched them very closely to see what they would\ndo.” In short order Plato’s friends and family unblinkingly implemented one of the\nmost violent, merciless power mechanisms in Athenian history. They did it with\nabsolute confidence and unrelenting brutality. “In quite a short time,” he wrote\nmany years later, “they had made the former government seem by comparison\nsomething precious as gold.”\nThis bitter experience of power was nearly enough to turn Plato from politics, but as\nyou read the story of his life you find he is constantly drawn to the greatest of\nhuman experiments – the ordering of our lives. He knew it as the troubling\nmanagement of politikos and the handling of the boiling pot of what he called\n198\nthumos – that wild popular political rage that burns like hot pitch, but which is the\nessential glue for all politics, even today. Who should rule? Again and again Plato\nwatches the best of intentions fail. His family members’ brutal rule is overthrown. It\nis replaced by a new and hopeful group of real democrats. With in a few years they\neffectively murder Socrates. Another group rises. They gut the intellectual life of the\ncity. Plato hunkers down and establishes his Academy as perhaps the only safe,\nsensible path to politics, to train minds. He develops the transcendent, completely\noriginal approach to philosophy we know him for today – man can strive for\nknowledge, but total and perfect wisdom is impossible. We may imagine his\nAcademy as it appears in Raphael’s famous 16 th Century painting: A sort of leisurely\ngraduate seminar with Aristotle and Plato arm-in-arm in conversation; Diogenes\nlounging around tossing off bon mot. It was nothing of the sort. The real legacy of\nthe Academy was rigor. The best students made contributions in mathematics or\nmetaphysics, fields where you could check answers on the inflexible measure of\nreality. Plato craved the solidity of numbers. “Evil was growing with startling\nrapidity,” he wrote of Athenian life in his age. “Though at first I had been full of a\nstrong impulse towards political life, as I looked at the course of affairs and saw\nthem swept in all directions by contending currents, my head finally began to swim;\nand, though I did not stop looking to see if there was any likelihood of improvement\nin these symptoms and in the general course of public life, I postponed action till a\nsuitable opportunity should arise.”\nSo it was that he heard from Dion, asking if Plato might sail to Syracuse (we know it\ntoday as Sicily) to take the young king in hand. This was, Plato thought, a test he had\nto take. In 367 BC, he boarded a boat for Syracuse. He found the state to be beyond\nsalvation. His friend Dion hovered on the verge of expulsion. And young Dionysus, it\nemerged, had only a passing interest in philosophy – he studied for a few months,\nthen gave it up. Too difficult. The court was meanwhile inflated by evil gossip, edged\nwith murder and jealousy. Plato angered the King with his attitude; he was nearly\nsold into slavery. Months later, briefly forgiven, Plato tried a public speech about the\ndangers of dictatorship. Dionysus tried to have him poisoned. “I, an Athenian and\nfriend of Dion, came as his ally to the court of Dionysius, in order that I might create\ngood will in place of a state war,” he later said. “I was worsted.” Plato made a final\neffort to point out a path to just order for the new king and, when that failed, he was\nquickly smuggled out of the city. Plato summarizes his time in Sicily in the formula\nthat has become his most famous: “There will be no cessation of evils for the sons of\nmen, till either those who are pursuing a right and true philosophy receive\nsovereign power, or those in power become true philosophers.” Who should rule?\nNo just order until kings become philosophers. Or philosophers become kings.\nI think now we face a similar sort of dilemma. We consider our own problems of\nfuture order. Do we make technologists kings? How much purchase do we give their\ntools on the roots of our democracy? What lingers at the heart of Plato’s failure in\nSyracuse is not merely the disaster of a pure academic playing his ideas out of tune\nwith reality. Rather, it reflects a crisis. To fuse a balance of any sort between the\nvarious temperaments needed to rule is the most unstable sort of work. Great states\nare unusual not least because such matches between men, their instincts and their\n199\ntimes are unusual: Jefferson. Napoleon. Su Dongpo, who led the Southern Song\nDynasty to real greatness. Given the difficulty of finding such a match you can\nperhaps understand why history is so often pitched with evil; and why Plato was not\na democrat. He knew how hard the ideal was to achieve; how suspicious we ought to\nbe of it’s accomplishment. You might have in your mind a picture of a perfect Sicilian\ngovernment: Literate, open to foreign ideas and trade, careful to balance the\nprivilege of power with its still heavier obligations. The reality: A homicidal king.\nThe stretched distance between ideal and reality was what Plato and Socrates\nthought philosophy must fill.\nAs we consider the immense gap between where we are now – a fracturing,\nstruggling order confronting new power arrangements whose content and speed\nand instincts are all really foreign to all of us – the puzzle is how best to fill the space\nbetween where we are now and where we intend to go. In Plato and Socrates’ age,\nbefore they great emancipation of the Enlightenment, it was only natural that their\nfocus was on the education of kings. This, after all, was where most of the power lay.\nIt was the decisive element: Was the ruler good or bad? But we confront our age\nwith a different balance. What will decide our future, I think, is not merely our rulers\nbut the quality of our citizens. I mean you and me. As we’ve seen, much of our future\nwill be embodied in highly concentrated, connected systems that move at very rapid\nvelocities and are spliced everywhere with the accelerant of artificial intelligence.\nWe are all preparing ourselves to be subjugated in a sense by these systems and by\ntheir masters. Our best defense will not be to wait for wise leaders, for the\nappearance of men and women bespoke fit to the moment, capable of balancing\ninstinct and interest into a rare balance. They are unlikely to emerge – and just\ngetting rid of the people we have now will be hard enough. Any strategy based on\nhoping for great leadership is too risky for all of us. No, a better best defense is\nfinally to rely on ourselves, to use the inheritance of the Enlightenment – the\nrevolution one that made us citizens and not subjects – to ensure we’re not made\nsubjects yet again, to forces we can’t understand and won’t manage to control. In\ntrading our liberty for convenience, we are spending that inheritance too fast now,\ntoo blindly.\nIt would be easy enough to say that we all need to become more technical, that we\nneed new versions of Plato’s Academy where we teach our children, our leaders and\nourselves the inside tricks of the wired age. After all, if we’re to prevent the\nmachines and the New Caste and the ripping dangers of a connected age from\ndemolishing everything, we’d best know what they are doing. The need for more\ntechnical knowledge for all of us is, inarguably, clear. As I’ve said, one of our\nproblems is that we live in an era of leaders who honestly don’t have the Seventh\nSense, who lack a fluency even with the mundane quotidian demands of our digital\nfluxus – secure passwords on their own email, say, or an instinct for compressed\nspace and time. Mapped on to the really big policy questions of the day, like the\nprosecution of our wars or the repair of our economics, they are outmatched. So:\nYes, we need political direction informed by a feel for the fast, far-running fibers of\nthe topological landscape that will decide our future. We need men and women who\ncan command networks against network dangers. Linked, high-speed systems, after\n200\nall, mark the political topology on which on which all the fundamental act of our age\nwill occur: our own gating.\nBut as essential as more technical knowledge is, I don’t think it’s likely to be where\nwe come up short. Yes we need more computer coding academies, we need better\npopular education about network choices, we need to retool our leaders. But I don’t\nthink it’s a shortage of bolt-heads that will do us in. Rather, given the unique\npressures of what is ahead, I think it is our human side that may let us down. I’m\nsure we’ll all be told in coming years that everything would be fine if we just let the\nNew Caste figures take over, with their bloodless technological tools. These\nrevolutionaries are a crucial part of the story of human progress, but they cannot\nalone write the next chapters. I think, asked to run our government, they’d likely\nend up like Plato’s pro-Spartan relatives in that awful dictatorship of the Thirty: A\ncrew of buddies convinced they can get things under control who become rapidly\noverwhelmed by the human element, by wild network thumos and then reduced to a\nmurderous madness. They would use technology to manipulate our voting just as\nthey might manipulate our options for a new liver – or news or financial security.\n“One of the reasons computer software is so abysmal is that it’s not designed at all,\nbut merely engineered,” the computer scientist Terry Winograd has written.\n“Another reason is that implementers often place more emphasis on a programs\ninternal construction than its external design.” 271 This black-box temperament, the\nsense of efficacy as a final value for code, of internal design, of closed control, is a\ndangerous fit to the human business of free politics.\nBut to expect our current leaders to catch up? I fear this is also unlikely. It’s not\nmerely that they continue to wield the aging tools of industrial power with a strange\nconfidence. No, their failures – which don’t seem to faze them much – are less\ndangerous than where they might yet succeed: Control, surveillance, the shredding\nof liberty in the name of an elusive safety. These leaders are fascinated by how the\nnew tools might be used to extend the rule of a system that serves their interests,\nthat serves them. The fear that such tools might one day snap back upon them (or\nus) is muted by ignorance and dulled by greed; by vision that does not extend much\nbeyond “What’s in this for me?” So we find our future not in our own hands, but\ninstead in the grip of two groups: One ignorant of networks; the other ignorant of\nhumanity. The only answer, then, is to educate ourselves. We need to cultivate a\nsensibility that permits us to see through this manipulation; and then to act. The\ninstincts of technology and of history must emerge in our calculations now. What\nwill serve us best in a technical age is a sense of humanity that the old political\nmachines and the New Caste digital ones can’t match.\nOne of the most famous gates that Plato and Socrates drew around their imagined,\nideal and perfect republic was a kind of electric fence against, of all things, poets. As\nSocrates explains in The Republic, poets “maim the thoughts of those who hear\nthem.” Poetry appeared to the philosophers as a pernicious force, an injection of\n271 “One of the reasons”: Terry Winograd, Bringing Design to Software (New York:\nACM Press, 1996) p. 5\n201\npassion and madness that sent the heart into spasms and pressed the mind to\ndistraction. This was about the last thing a new state needed. “Poetry mustn't be\ntaken seriously as a serious thing laying hold of truth,” Socrates warns. “The man\nwho hears it must be careful, fearing for the regime in himself.” Thus: Hesiod’s\nmagnificent Works and Days, banned. Homer, banned. There has always been, about\npoetry, this sense of the magical, that it was a key to something intimately bound to\nthe human mystery. It was no surprise to me to find, when I went back to re-read\nTuring’s “Can Machines Think?” essay, that the very first thing the great\nmathematician dreamed up to ask a digital brain was: “Write me a sonnet.” Poetry\nhas always marked a test. Socrates and Plato gatekeep the poets out of their republic\nbecause they know the mad part of the soul verse can touch. It is hard to blame\nthem. After all, they were among the earliest Western minds to try to dispel\nmadness and superstition and sophistry. Without their logic and effort there would\nbe no Aristotle, no science, none of the sense of our world as a comprehensible\nmachine. The confidence to philosophize – which for them meant also to poke at the\npolitical wiring of our world – demanded the break from poetry and mysticism as a\nsource of action or legitimacy. Had they failed, we’d still be in the dark. But had they\ncompletely succeeded? We’d hardly be human.\nYou know, as I’ve said, when I first moved to China, there were so many things that\nbaffled me. (There still are, to be honest.) But very high on that list was a peculiarity\nof ancient Chinese political life. For thousands of years the greatest poets and\npainters had also been emperors and politicians. Su Dongpo, for instance, the official\nwho turned the lake city of Hangzhou into one of the great cultural centers of human\nhistory is also one of China’s best regarded poets. The calligraphy of the Qing\ndynasty Mingzhen Emperor is marked with a temprament of transcendent delicacy.\nIt’s not merely that we’d never seriously expect a Western political figure to make\ngreat art – or even to have interesting ideas or be able to write these days. It’s not\neven that many of the most significant Chinese political documents are paintings of\nmountains or rivers, that even letters from high officials are often rated as great art.\nMy first encounter with this strange mix, art and power mingled, produced a\npredictable Western reaction: It’s amazing how many “Renaissance Men” China had, I\nthought. These officials seemed to have mastered so many different talents. What I\ndid not understand was that these men had not, in fact, mastered many different\ntalents, at least not in any way I might understand it. They were not “Renaissance\nMen”, but actually a different breed, operating on a deeper level. They had mastered\none skill. This was the cultivation of a finely-tuned inner energy – an instinct\npowerful enough that it could be turned with equal ease to calligraphy or warfare.\nThis sort of effort took time. It demanded that knife-in-the-leg focus of Su Qin. And it\ndemanded faith that some sort of enlightenment would in fact take place. For this,\nthey had thousands of years of history as proof. Once this breakthrough to inner\nknowledge happened, once they developed a fine sensitivity to the underlying force\nof power, then they could tap into it for anything. Fighting wars. Counseling princes.\nFishing. Composing poetry.\n202\nThere is a lesson for us here, one that redounds onto Plato’s political question and\nour own: Who should rule? We feel overwhelmed by our age. So much to master:\nFighting wars. Complex politics. Radically changing economics. New technologies\nreplacing old ones before we can understand them. The mastery of each of these will\nnot be achieved by dashing success in each. So we need to cultivate a single,\nessential instinct here. A new temprament that I’ve called The Seventh Sense. And,\nwith that done, to fight the wars, write the poems, make the civilizations to confront\nall that lies ahead. Our greatest hope in the race against the totalizing machines and\nthose who control them; our finest insurance for liberty and prosperity instead of\nmadness is not in technology. Our greatest weapon will not be our bombers our\ndrones or our financial strength. It will be in our own humanity. We have to accept\nthat we are going to be gated in all the ways we’ve seen: By speed, by AI, by the New\nCaste. We’ll be torn apart by those new network dynamics, and placed on topologies\nwe can hardly understand. Our future fight is not about if we are going to be\nenmeshed or not. It is about the terms of that enmeshment – and it is here that the\ngreat questions of politics will be decided. And where the protection of the things\nyou love and care about will be braced against the crashing of an old order.\n5.\nEverything ahead of us will be political. We’ve established already: Connection\nchanges the nature of an object. What’s true for a phone or a medical device, a\nweapon or an currency is true too for a vote. Or a citizen. The nature, the essence of\nan object changes as a result of connectivity. It takes that old Platonic notion of an\n“ideal” state and stretches it beyond what we’re fully capable of understanding. Our\npuzzle is that while “we are what we are connected to,” it is also true that we don’t\nfully know or understand just what those links are yet. At certain moments it seems\nwe’re linked to something miraculous, at others to a system of really instant\nviciousness. And because we are all connected, changes in one part of the system\ninvariably redound elsewhere. An object seems miraculous one moment, violent the\nnext. This isn’t getting easier for us. We are, as we’ve seen, heading to an era where\nthe machines and the networks will have ever more, ever more decisive power,\nlargely because we’ve given it to them. We’d be wise to consider the lesson of\nhistory here: Structures snap when bent by forces for which they are not prepared.\nThose fast, hammering centuries that ran from the reformation to the scientific\nrevolution to the enlightenment to the industrial revolution were like this. The\nredistribution of power and finance into the hands of the many demanded the\ndemolition of old structures, the ones mastered by a few. For one man to rule\nmillions with no reason other than birth made no sense anymore. The last six\ncenturies have been nothing but a tale of liberation, its price and its rewards. We are\nmore free now than we ever have been, in a sense. And, at this very same moment,\nwe are more enmeshed. Power is moving now from institutions and ideas built for\nliberty to ones built for enclosure, for connection, for speed and for the beyondhuman\nintelligence that complexity demands. This will snap our votes, our money\nand our ideas with the same blunt efficiency the last revolution managed in Luther’s\n203\nWittenberg church, in the American and French revolutions, in the silent fatal\ncracking of Ghandi’s India and Mandela’s South Africa.\nWe know that no political system that doesn’t match the power distribution of the\nsociety it governs can endure. Feudal order could not survive the pressures of\nliberty. Can democracy withstand the pressures of enmeshment, of massive\nconcentration of power, of artificial intelligences. Or will the slow, inefficient\nreaction time of popular voting prove finally unequal to the complexity ahead of us\nor too easy to manipulate? Writing of the Enlightenment, the historian Leon-Michel\nGambetta once explained that the goal of politics in the age of liberation and\nquestioning was, “to derive the political and social system from the idea of reason\nrather than that of grace.” What to do now? In a world where we may need to derive\na political system girded by tools of AI or wired by fast-moving and emergent\nnetworks, that can’t quite be derived from reason? What will the goal of politics be\nthen? When the first AI runs for President on a ticket of pure efficacy? Or perhaps\nDemocratic and Reblican candidates will debate who has the best AI. How will you\nvote?\nWe need already to reevaluate the idea of citizenship. What is it for? And the state\ntoo. To fit these roles into an age of liberation took centuries after Luther began the\nreformation; we may have but decades to decide what they mean in an age of\nenmsemhment. Does setting geographic and age criteria for voting still make sense?\nOne man one vote? Is there a better system to deal with complex issues? The\neconomists Daron Aceomoglu and James Robinson, in their magestirial study Why\nNations Fail marked success or collapse by these lines: Countries with “inclusive”\ninstitutions which guarded both elites and society at large have historically fared\nbetter than those (think of Russia or Latin America) that ran on “extractive” urges,\nnations machined to secure the profits and serenity of the elites alone. But where to\nfit our gated world into such an analysis, an era in which linked institutions benefit\nboth the gated and gatekeeper? Would you say such a system was extractive as it\nsucks our data and habits and secrets into massive, opaque finance or machine\nlearning systems? Or inclusive because, after all, we’re enmeshed in a web of newly\nfound linked wealth: time, health, finance, information, security. Networks in so\nmany ways insist on fresh considerations of power. What sorts of network design is\nlikely to be most effective, most legitimate? Kant’s famous question of the 1780s –\n“What is Enlightenment?” – is one we’ve not yet perfectly answered or resolved. The\nnew puzzle of “What is Enmeshment” is one we’re only beginning to consider now.\nIt too will take lifetimes to answer, and the debate will be decied in the collision of\nideas and institutions we can’t even dream of today with the structures of power\nthat tower around us now.\nAt least we can see already that we’ll need new ways to consider our future political\norder, mashed through as it will be by connection, machines and hot human hopes\nand fears. We’ll certainly face our own turning points as our institutions collapse or\ncalcify or (hopefully) redesign themselves in some modern version of Britain’s\nbloodless 1688 Glorious Revolution, that ineffable moment when parliamentary\n204\npower finally achieved real grip. Recall that important distinction between\n“Predictive Learning” and “Representational Learning” – and how machines with a\ndeep representation outperformed the ones merely predicting, the difference\nbetween recognizing a Mozart symphony and writing one? We ourselves need to\nmove now from predictive to representational views of our world. We need an\nhistorical sense, of course. But something else too, that Seventh Sense I’ve been\nwriting about. So much of what lies ahead can’t, of course, be predicted by looking at\nwhat has come before. And we won’t make this leap to a new representation of the\nworld around us with mere technology. That passage to a new, and subtle insight, to\na new instinct, demands wisdom.\nThere will be a point, several hundred years from now, when the answers to the\nfundamental questions we now face will be decided. A new political order, tuned to\nthe power laws now visible with the Seventh Sense will emerge. Our question we\nwill often ask on that long passage is this: Can more and more technology bridge the\ngap between the ideal society we might aim for and the troubled one we have? Or\nmight it crank that gap wider still? My sense is that the antidote to the machines and\ntheir new logic is not, in the end to make ourselves more like the machines.\nEncryption alone won’t protect our privacy. Mobility won’t assure our liberty. We\ncan’t keep up with the innovations, to be honest. So we have to go deeper. Our\nprotection will come from making ourselves more human, not just more technical.\nWe should consider the path Su Dongpo’s life suggest, the cultivation of an inner\ninstinct, and that this should touch on the very things that make us most human.\nThis means to make ourselves more political, more cultured, more aware of history\nand ideas. Which problems do we solve with technology? Which ones with our own\nhearts and minds? This choice, at least, is still before us.\nTake a moment. Look at yourself. Feel yourself with the Seventh Sense. Through\neach of us now will flow all the power of this new age. Yes, it can jack apart all our\nold habits and fill the passage of our time with all the dangers of evil as we silently\nwatch terrible and fearful things appear from nowhere. But we can also wake up,\nsee the world accurately and then act with the confidence of knowing that we are,\neach of us, the passage through with which the future will emerge. At the very\nmoment we might feel so many of our burdens lifted by technology, an old and\nheavy one crashes down upon us. It is the burden of maintaining our liberty. Now,\nyou and me are, like it or not, what we are connected to.\n205",
