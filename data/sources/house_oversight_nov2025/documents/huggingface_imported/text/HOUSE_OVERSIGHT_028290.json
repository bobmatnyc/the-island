The show, entitled \"The House of the Noble Man\" (12-20 October), will open at 2 Cornwall\nTerrace, an 18th-century building off Regent's Park in London near to the Frieze Art Fair site. The exhibition is\ncurated by artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, whose works will feature in the display, and Russian curator Victoria\nGolembiovskaya. Around £20m worth of art will be for sale, approximately a third of the show, confirms Von\nLenkiewicz.\n\nAccording to the co-curator, the Picasso pieces on offer will include Buste d'Homme a Ia Pipe (1969, priced at\n£3m); the 1905 drawing The Family of Saltimbanques and a cubist painting, Nature Morte au Gobelet (around\n1914).

Von Lenkiewicz's own works will be in the\n£30,000-£60,000 price range.\n\n\"The Picassos etc. are from anonymous dealers who will take their portion of the percentages. Any other\nproceeds made during the show will go back into the funding of the exhibition which is hugely expensive despite\nits sponsorship [by the Russian real estate company Mirax],\" adds Von Lenkiewicz. A selection of works from\nCharles Saatchi's \"New Sensations 2010\" roster of emerging artists will also be for sale. Twenty students\nshortlisted for the prize, which is sponsored by Cadogan Tate, have been chosen to present their work; these\nartists include Matthew Welch, Katie Sims and Pablo Wendel. A non-selling section will include works from the\nLondon-based Zabludowicz Collection and the holdings of the Iraqi-born industrialist Ragdan El-akabi.\n\n\"The show came about when | was in Moscow exhibiting my work at Triumph Gallery. Victoria took me to the\nMirax city project, a huge development in central Moscow. She talked to Sergei Polonsky [head of Mirax] about\n\nthe Cornwall Terrace buildings which he has shares in. He was willing to sponsor the show,\" says Von Lenkiewicz.\nThe Mirax group are co-developers of the Cornwall Terrace historical complex, parts of which are up for sale.\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028290",
