We think that large defense imports are typically amortized over a\nnumber of years. Defence spending is an important part of fiscal spending in Saudi\nArabia, accounting for c30% of total budgeted spending. Defence spending in 2016 was\nbudgeted at SAR213bn (US$56.9bn; 9.0% of GDP), down from SAR307bn (US$81.8bn;\n12.7% of GDP) in 2015. Increased military and security projects in 2015 saw an\nadditional overspend of SAR2Obn last year. It is unclear to us if all of the regional\nmilitary costs have been recognised on-balance sheet. A negotiated settlement to the\nYemen conflict through the ongoing political negotiations in Kuwait could help contain\nsecurity spending near-term.\n\n22 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016132",
