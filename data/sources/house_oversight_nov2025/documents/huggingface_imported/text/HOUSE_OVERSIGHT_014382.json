  "text": "First Bancorp Puerto Rico (FBP)\n\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $6.50 price\nobjective. We assign a 1.0x multiple to our 2Q17E TBV, below the 1.6X for peers, due to\nthe overhang of PR fiscal issues that may reduce TBV. Our revised implied 2Q17E TBV\nof 1.0x is consistent with a 5% ROE. We assign a 10x multiple to our 2017E EPS, in line\nwith peers. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth\nrate of 3%.\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are a worse-than-expected restructuring of PR\ngovernment debt, deterioration in the Puerto Rican economy that could hurt the ongoing\ncredit and earnings recovery at FBP, a change in management's strategy to dispose\ntroubled assets, and potential regulatory risk stemming from the ongoing\nimplementation of the Dodd-Frank financial rules. Upside risks to our price objective are\na much stronger economic improvement in Puerto Rico and a better-than-expected\nimprovement in asset quality trends at FBP.\n\nFirst Hawaiian Inc. (FHB)\n\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $31 PO\nand assign a 2.2x multiple to 2017E TBV and 17x multiple on 2017E EPS, representing\npremium target multiples for the median smid-cap banks under coverage. We have\nweighted the P/E and P/TBV factors equally.\n\nA superior profitability profile suggests an above peer multiple. Our DCF assumes a two-\nstage cost of capital of 8% and a terminal growth rate of 4%.\n\nRisks include 1) FHB's reliance on the Hawaiian economy with 80% of the franchise\nspread across Hawaii, Guam, and Saipan poses downside risk to EPS from a severe\neconomic downturn in this region. 2) While FHB has a history of conservative\nunderwriting its exposure to auto loans could serve as an overhang if investor concerns\naround the health of the auto sector and consumer increase. 3) Expectations for\ncontinued divestiture by French bank BNP (owns 82% of shares o/s) could temper stock\nperformance.\n\nFirst Horizon National Corp. (FHN)\n\nWe use a three-prong valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $16 price\nobjective and assign a 1.5x multiple to 2Q17E TBV and a 14x multiple to 2017E EPS\n(inline with median for our mid-to-small cap universe). We believe that this valuation\ndiscount is warranted given the below average earnings growth that we forecast for\nFHN. Our P/TBV and P/E targets reflect our expectation that earnings growth and\nprofitability will remain challenged by a low growth low interest rate environment. Our\nDCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 5%.\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are a double dip in home prices and slower\nresidential real estate recovery. Upside risks are FHN being taken out above our price\nobjective and better performance in the economy than we expect.\n\nFranklin Financial Network, Inc. (FSB)\n\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $36 price\nobjective and assign a 1.8x multiple to our 2Q17E TBV, given that we believe the market\nwould pay no premium for FSB's 2016 estimated returns of 14%, below the median of\nits peer group (High performing, Southeast peers, and SMIDs). We place a 14x multiple\non our 2017E EPS, a premium to its peer group given above average expected EPS\ngrowth. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth\nrate of 3%.\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) execution risk leading to slower than\nexpected loan growth or lower than expected improvement in the efficiency ratio, 2}\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n68 2016 Future of Financials Conference | 17 November 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014382",
