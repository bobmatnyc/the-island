  "text": "Te Fundamental Four are so named because they are the four books I recommended to aspiring\n\nlifestyle designers prior to writing The 4-Hour Workweek. Still well worth reading, here is the sequence I\nsuggest:\n\nThe Magic of Thinking Big (192 pages)\n\nBY DAVID SCHWARTZ\n\nThis book was first recommended to me by Stephen Key, an ultrasuccessful inventor who has made\nmillions licensing products to companies, including Disney, Nestlé, and Coca-Cola. It is the favorite\nbook of many superperformers worldwide, ranging from legendary football coaches to famous CEOs,\nand has more than 100 5-star ratings on Amazon. The main message is don’t overestimate others and\nunderestimate yourself. I still read the first two chapters of this book whenever doubt creeps in.\n\nHow to Make Millions with Your Ideas:\n\nAn Entrepreneur’s Guide (272 pages)\n\nBY DAN S. KENNEDY\n\nThis is a menu of options for converting ideas into millions. I read this when I was in high school and\nhave read it five times since. It is like steroids for your entrepreneurship cortex. The case studies, from\nDomino’s Pizza to casinos and mail-order products, are outstanding, even if outdated in a few instances.\n\nThe E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don’t Work and What to Do About It (288 pages)\nBY MICHAEL E. GERBER\n\nGerber is a masterful storyteller and his classic of automation discusses how to use a franchise mind-set\nto create scalable businesses that are based on rules and not outstanding employees. It is an excellent\nroad map—told in parable—for becoming an owner instead of constant micromanager. If you’re stuck in\nyour own business, this book will get you unstuck in no time.\n\nVagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel (224 pages)\n\nBY ROLF POTTS\n\nRolf is the man. This is the book that got me to stop making excuses and pack for an extended hiatus. It\ncovers bits of everything but is particularly helpful for determining your destination, adjusting to life on\nthe road, and re-assimilating back into ordinary life. It includes great little excerpts from famous\nvagabonds, philosophers, and explorers, as well as anecdotes from ordinary travelers. This is the first of\ntwo books (the other was Walden, below) that I took with me on my first 15-month mini-retirement.\n\nReducing Emotional and Material Baggage\n\nWalden (384 pages)\nBY HENRY DAVID THOREAU\n\nThis is considered by many to be the masterpiece of reflective simple living. Thoreau lived on the edge\nof a small lake in rural Massachusetts for two years, building his own shelter and living alone, as an\nexperiment in self-reliance and minimalism. It was both a huge success and a failure, which is what\nmakes this book such a compelling read.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014030",
