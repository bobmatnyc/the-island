Because if you do, it means you’re in a world\nof trouble.\nThe Steptoe & Johnson LLP partner is one of the country’s preeminent white collar defense\nlawyers. His clients have included former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers, former Enron\nchief accounting officer Richard Causey, former Tyco general counsel Mark Belnick and film\ndirector Roman Polanski, as well as Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.\nBut if you do have to call him, here’s a bonus: he’s one of the most\ninteresting, engaging lawyers you’ll ever meet.\nWeingarten spoke at length with the Litigation Daily about his\npractice—what it means when he wants the “smart jurors,” what he\nsays to prosecutors in their offices to convince them not to bring a case,\nhow he and close friend Eric Holder Jr. years ago started a foundation\nthat has helped thousands of juvenile offenders and at-risk teens.\nThe interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nLit Daily: A corporate executive recently told me he thought the best\nlawyers are as much psychologists as legal experts. Do you agree?\nReid Weingarten: Yes, yes, yes. The ratio is probably two-thirds lawyer, one-third shrink.\nThere are two distinct parts to my practice—the New York piece, largely CEOs and CFOs,\nWall Street guys, hedge fund guys—and the D.C. piece, largely but not exclusively public\nofficial types and people who deal with public officials.\nThese are all big-ego, extraordinarily successful people who find themselves dramatically at\nodds with Uncle Sam, because typically people don’t come to me unless the Justice\nDepartment wants to put them in prison for a long time and take all their money.\nWhite Collar Titan Reid Weingarten on Juries Clients and the Scariest Federal Prosecutor...\nhttp://www.litigationdaily.com/printerfriendly/id=1202736534962\nPage 2 of 5\n9/8/2015\nSometimes their reaction is denial, sometimes shock and horror, sometimes anger, but it’s\nalways dramatic. The mission at a minimum is to get the client to understand what’s\nhappening so that he can be effective for me, in terms of my defending him.\nLD: Have you ever declined to represent someone because you were so appalled by what\nthey did?\nRW: At this point, I’m in the fortunate position of turning down more cases than I take. I turn\ndown cases for many reasons, though it’s not so much that I’m appalled by the behavior.\nThe way I look at it is, do I bring value? Is there something about me representing the\nindividual that adds something, as opposed to every other lawyer in town? I think if I halted,\nor I was so shocked or appalled or dismayed by the conduct that I’d pull my punches, I’d\nknow that.\nI break bread with the would-be client. If there’s a visceral feel, either overtly or covertly, that\nI’m not going to want to spend time with him or her, it all factors in. There are often a variety\nof factors that cause me to take seriously the potential of the representation, and then I turn\nit down.\nLD: Are conflicts much of an issue?\nRW: Steptoe & Johnson is a big firm, but it’s not one of the megafirms. There have probably\nbeen a dozen significant matters I got conflicted out of because of Steptoe’s other\nrepresentations. But I have colleagues who work at much bigger firms who are constantly\ngetting conflicted out of representations.\nI represented the CEO of Goldman Sachs, and Goldman intersects with everyone in the\nworld. If I had nothing but Goldman-like representations, that would be an issue. But if you\nrepresent Jesse Jackson Jr. or [other] public officials, as I do, the potential for conflicts is\nsignificantly less.\nLD: What agency is most likely to strike fear in the heart of defendants?\nRW: The Southern District of New York is the elite prosecutor’s office in the country. I don’t\nthink you’d get much dispute there. They’re aggressive, they’re smart, they have this\nenormous home court advantage. Right after them, there are several very fine, very\naggressive, very talented U.S. attorneys offices like Chicago, Boston, EDVA and certainly\nthe District of Columbia. And you can go to Topeka, Kansas, or Burlington, Vermont, and\nfind a federal prosecutor who is very smart, has a good case and is talented in court.\nIn the Justice Department itself, there’s the Criminal Division, and the two litigating\nsections—the public integrity section, where I was for 10 years, and the fraud section.\nThey’ve had their ups and downs. As a defense attorney dealing with both sections\nregularly, you can have your hands full with either.\nLD: Some of the people you’ve represented have been so high-profile. How much of a\nchallenge is jury selection, and how do you handle it?\nRW: By way of example, in my most recent trial I went down to New Orleans. I represented\nthe former head of exploration for BP, who was accused of lying to Congress about how\nWhite Collar Titan Reid Weingarten on Juries Clients and the Scariest Federal Prosecutor...\nhttp://www.litigationdaily.com/printerfriendly/id=1202736534962\nPage 3 of 5\n9/8/2015\nmuch oil was coming out of the hole after the explosion. BP had pleaded guilty to the very\nsame conduct and paid $4 billion. That was not a positive piece.\nI was told by everybody that BP was loathed in New Orleans. So now I have to pick a jury in\nNew Orleans for the very same conduct the company pleaded guilty to. And BP had paid a\nzillion dollars to every fisherman and stripper in New Orleans who claimed the spill\nprevented them from earning a living. But now, BP was getting pissed off that they were\ngetting ripped off, and were pulling back. In addition to being hated for killing all the pelicans\nand ruining tourism and fishing, now they’re pulling back on their largesse.\nSo I have to pick a jury. We had all the consultants you can imagine. The common wisdom\nwas, don’t pick anybody close to the gulf, because anyone close to the explosion will hate\nBP, and don’t take African-Americans because they hate fancy white lawyers from\nWashington, blah blah blah.\nI picked a jury and I did exactly the opposite, because my gut was that a sophisticated\nperson near the water who is familiar with the industry will appreciate how difficult it is to drill\nthese wells. If you have 100 deep sea wells in the gulf, every once in a while, you’re going to\nhave an accident.\nAnd there’s no reason to assume that the rest of the population, no matter what their\nbackground or color, wouldn’t strive to be fair. I also thought I had the upper hand in that I\ndidn’t think my client was guilty of anything, so I went against the grain.\nYou have standard thinking among most defense counsel on jury selection, and this is an\ninstance where I threw it out, and the jury came back in about two seconds and acquitted. I\nwas lucky and right.\nIt’s interesting to see who wants the smart jurors. Sometimes prosecutors want the smart\njurors, sometimes I want the smart jurors. That is an indication of who thinks they have the\nrighteous case. When prosecutors are striking all the lawyers and accountants and collegeeducated\npeople, and—in New York City this happens—they want doormen and bus drivers,\nwhat they want is to rely on visceral hatred for the target and also a visceral reliance on\nUncle Sam, as opposed to the facts.\nWhen that happens, I want to blow my brains out, because that’s not how prosecutors\nshould behave. Prosecutors always should have the righteous case, and it should only be\ncrafty defense attorneys who want to obscure the facts. When I want the smart jurors\nbecause I think I have a righteous case, that case never should have been brought.\nThese days I find that to be the case many times.\nLD: How do you prepare for court? Do you rehearse what you’re going to say?\nRW: I can’t prepare that way. There are clients who say, \"I want to hear your opening before\nyou make it.\" I say, \"Get another lawyer.\"\nThis is not good or bad, it’s just Reid. I can’t say the same thing twice, and I cannot read a\nspeech. It’s not how I work with information.\nWhite Collar Titan Reid Weingarten on Juries Clients and the Scariest Federal Prosecutor...\nhttp://www.litigationdaily.com/printerfriendly/id=1202736534962\nPage 4 of 5\n9/8/2015\nIf I think there’s a real likelihood there’s going to be a trial, I’ll make a file for opening, a file\nfor closing, a file for putting the client on, and I’ll make a cross-examination file for the snitch\nor snitches. If I’m taking a walk or kayaking in the North Atlantic or sleeping and have a\nthought, I’ll throw notes in there. Two days before the opening, I’ll go through the notes.\nI’ll have it largely in my head. I used to have a chocolate Lab I’d walk in the woods behind\nmy house. I’d talk to myself, and I’d talk to Emma the chocolate Lab, and we’d try things and\nI’d practice my opening with her, but only with her.\nThe notes I toss in those files end up being what I do in court.\nLD: You’ve been described as “almost constitutionally incapable of settling a case.” Do you\nthink that’s true?\nRW: No. I’ve had a lot of trials, but the great majority of my advocacy is done in prosecutors’\noffices. I’ll say one or two things. One is that ‘this is not a righteous case, and here’s why,’\nand/or ‘If you bring it, I’ll kick your ass.’ I find sometimes No. 2 is more effective, especially if\nit’s a high-profile matter. In that sense, the case doesn’t go to trial.\nBut Jesse Jackson Jr., for example, pleaded guilty and went to prison for couple of years. I\ndidn’t do it because I am a snitch lawyer or because I’m a rollover guy. I did it because the\nevidence was overwhelming, and there was no choice about it, and it was in his interest.\nAnd of course it was what he wanted to do.\nI settle cases. But the people who come to me generally are people who have thought\nthrough the issues and decided there’s a real chance of a scrap, and someone recommends\nme. Those are the people with whom I have the initial conversation, not people who are\nlooking for an old-timer who routinely gets the best deals. Those are not the people who\ncome to me.\nLD: How do you handle losses?\nRW: Do I want to throw myself off a bridge? Yeah. It’s interesting psychologically—I just had\nthis very nice win in New Orleans. I expected it, I was gratified, I’m very fond of my client, I\nwas pleased—and three minutes later I’m done, on to the next one. When I lose, I replay the\nspool and second-guess myself constantly. It’s hard to shake. The pain of a defeat is much\ngreater than the joy of victory. I don’t know why that is—I wish it were otherwise.\nLD: Is there one win that stands out as particularly satisfying?\nRW: It would be hard to separate them out. A couple come immediately to mind.\nI represented a kid named Lamar Owens. He was a black Navy quarterback accused of rape\nby a white young woman who was his classmate. He actually moved into my house and\nbecame close friends with my son. He was acquitted of the rape charge.\nI represented Ron Carey, the president of the Teamsters, during 9/11. I actually saw the\nsecond plane go into the tower. And we came back two weeks later when the court was put\nback together and got an acquittal. That was a huge experience.\nWhite Collar Titan Reid Weingarten on Juries Clients and the Scariest Federal Prosecutor...\nhttp://www.litigationdaily.com/printerfriendly/id=1202736534962\nPage 5 of 5\n9/8/2015\nTed Wells [at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison] and I did Mike Espy together. That\nwas probably the first huge national trial I had as a defense lawyer. Espy was a very\npromising former congressman from Mississippi who [Bill] Clinton made secretary of\nAgriculture. It was very controversial because traditional, white hidebound farmers were not\ncrazy about Mike Espy being secretary, and he was charged with taking bribes from Don\nTyson. It was a huge trial, and I think there were 35 counts of not guilty on everything. That\nput me in a different place. I’m friends with Espy to this day, and very close friends with Ted\nWells.\nLD: Do you wind up being friends with many of your clients?\nRW: Some, certainly not all. For many, even when there’s an acquittal, the experience is so\nharrowing that they want to close that chapter. To maintain a relationship with me would\nhamper that closure for them.\nWith opposing counsel—these days, that’s prosecutors—one of two things happens. We\nbecome close friends or we never speak again. There’s no middle ground.\nLD: Tell me a little about the See Forever Foundation and how it came into existence.\nRW: By accident of history, [former Attorney General] Eric Holder and I are extremely close.\nWe grew up together in the Justice Department and had offices next to each other for many\nyears in the public integrity section. We’re like family. We used to go to Oak Hill, which was\nthen this dreadful juvenile justice facility in Maryland, and teach and tutor in the jail.\nWe came to the conclusion that one-third of these kids are hopelessly gone, we can’t fix\nthem no matter what, too much damage. One-third who knows, but one-third we could fix.\nThese were the kids with the bright eyes and quick wit, usually drug runners. We made a\ncommitment and we started the foundation. David Domenici, the son of the senator from\nNew Mexico, and James Forman Jr., son of the famous civil rights leader, they deserve the\ncredit. Reid Weingarten does not. I started it. Eric had to drop by the wayside when he\nbecame the U.S. attorney [for the District of Columbia], because he had to prosecute these\nkids. It was an obvious conflict. He’s been a supporter in his heart since then.\nBut David Domenici and James Forman are phenomenally gifted lawyers who for 20 years\nthrew their lives at this. They brought Maya Angelou in. Bob Strauss of Akin Gump gave us\na million bucks, and we bought a building on Ninth Street in the Shaw neighborhood. That\nwas a huge turning point.\nWe took over the education at Oak Hill, turned it around, and right now it’s a model for the\ncountry. We are also a large public charter school. Frankly, it’s had its ups and downs. But\nwhen I put my head down for the last time and think about what I’ve done and not done, the\nSee Forever experience will be one of the things that gives me the most satisfaction.\nContact Jenna Greene at jgreene@alm.com or on Twitter @jgreenejenna.\nCopyright 2015.
