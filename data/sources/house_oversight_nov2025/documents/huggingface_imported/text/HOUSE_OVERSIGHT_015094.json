  "text": "For example, | occasionally went too far while wearing my anti-\nCommunist mask. When former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach\nexposed the DuBois Clubs as a Communist front organization, poison-pen\nletters and threatening telephone calls were received by many of the Boys\nClubs from patriotic Americans who were understandably confused by the\nostensibly coincidental pronunciations. But in my function as National\nBoard Chairman of the Boys Clubs of America, | charged that the name\nchoice was “an almost classic example of Communist deception and\nduplicity” and that the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs “are not unaware of the\nconfusion they are causing among our supporters and among many other\ngood citizens.”\n\nIn retrospect, however, | admit that this was a slightly foolish\n\nposition to espouse.\n\nIn August of 1945, while | was still serving in the Navy, stationed in\nMaryland, there was a Committee of 100 seeking—according to an\nadvertisement they placed in several California newspapers—a candidate\nfor Congress “with no previous political experience, to defeat a man who\nhas represented the district in the House for ten years.” This was a\n\nreference to Jerry Voorhis.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015094",
