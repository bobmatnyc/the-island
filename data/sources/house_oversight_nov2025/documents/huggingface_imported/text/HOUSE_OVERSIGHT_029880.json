Milton Center is a \nDepartment of Juvenile Justice facility; therefore I will need to get her records from DJJ. DJJ will not release the records \nwithout a signed release by Jane Doe. I have attached a general HIPPA release for your review. Would you please have \nJane Doe sign it? DJJ does not have a standard form. \nAlso, will you agree to one more week on Responses to Net Wirth ROGS?? \nPlease let me know. \nJess — \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029882 \nfrJge..a e9), Yccia' \nCertified Paralegal \nFlorida Registered Paralegal \nBURMAN CRITTON LUTTIER & COLEMAN, LLP \n515 N.
