  "text": "Evolution of social connection by\ncommunication\n\nThe human social brain\nconstructs connection and understanding\nby anthropomorphic projection as\ndiscussed by Nick Epley in his chapter.\nWhen we observe the behavior of\nnonhuman entities, anthropomorphic\nprojection may form a feeling of social\nconnection. Social connection depends\nin part on empathic responses to\nobserved action. It has been argued that\nthis same foundation is the basis for the\nevolution of language as well--observed\naction may be the foundation for\nlanguage.”\n\nA mirror neuron theory of the\nevolution of language starts with the\nassumption that we understand others by\nobserving their actions. Communication\ndepends on the regularization of typical\nactions that can be pantomimed. In\nprinciple this could lead to a kind of\nmanual gestural system of\ncommunication akin to sign language.\nHand and arm movements can depict a\nwide range of actions both by first-\nperson depiction of an action such as\nscrewing the top onto a jar and by third-\nperson depictions such as using the\nfingers to portray a person walking.\nHand and arm postures can depict\nobjects such as a cupped hand\nrepresenting a bowl. Combining\nsequences of such object and action\ndepictions can communicate relatively\ncomplex messages even without a\nformal language. This is a far cry from\nsign languages in which the mapping\nbetween hand shapes and movements is\nnot visually transparent in this way. But\nas the pressure to communicate a\nbroader range of messages increases, a\nmanual gestural language would have to\nbe modified to reflect more abstract\n\nPage |71\n\nsymbols ultimately leading in the\ndirection of a sign language.\n\nHowever, this kind of manual\nlanguage has one major drawback.\nCommunication depends on visual\ncontact. In order to understand a\ngestural message it is necessary to see\nthe hand movements. This limits the\ndistances over which communication can\ntake place. Moreover, a communication\nsystem that is effective for a group\nshould not depend on face-to-face\ndyadic interaction, but allow for more\nbroadcast communications. There is a\ngreat survival advantage in being able to\nmaintain social connection and convey\ninformation over distances that go well\nbeyond face-to-face communication.\n\nMany species of fish,\namphibians, reptiles, birds, and\nmammals commonly exchange\ninformation at a distance through\nvocalizations. The learned songs (and\nsome calls) of songbirds are particularly\nrich sources of information conveying,\nto the receiver, individual identity and a\nhost of other characteristics of the\nsender. Some mammals exchange\ninformation at great distances through\ncalling behavior. Humpback whale\nvocalizations are perceived over\nextremely long distances and may be\nused to maintain social groups at\ndistances as great as 5 km. African\nelephants can recognize friends and\nrelatives from their calls at a distance of\n2.5 km. Human sheepherders keep each\nother company from the top of one\nmountain to another in the Canary\nIslands using a whistled language called\nSilbo Gomero. Whether for purposes of\nmating, threat, warning, or social\norganization, conveying information\nregarding location, identity and\nmotivation, and directed at one\nindividual or towards far-flung groups,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021317",
