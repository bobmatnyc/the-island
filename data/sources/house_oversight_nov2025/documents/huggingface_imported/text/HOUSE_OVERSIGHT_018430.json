  "text": "at the moment Turing warned about, the instant where man and machine confront\none another and man has to ask an uneasy political question: “Wow, do really | let\nthis thing gatekeep me?” Who should rule in this new world? You? The New Caste?\nThe machines?\n\n4,\n\nThe great test of Plato’s life began when he was 60 years old. He’d had an\nastonishing life until then, of course. He’d been taught by Socrates and, in turn, had\nsharpened the mind of Aristotle. He’d established his famous Academy in Athens.\nThe puzzles of philosophy and politics that defined his city’s most turbulent era had\nbeen the work of his life. And you can see, in the careful lines of his writing, a\nsublime knowledge he must have had: There would be an echo to his efforts, a\nphilosophic melody that would carry through the centuries and set political\nharmonies of the world you and IJ, 2500 years later, inhabit. But at 60, after this\nalready remarkable life, he was presented with an unusual invitation. A letter\narrived from a favorite former pupil, Dion, who had been placed in charge of the\nyoung king of Syracuse, Dionysus II. Dion wrote: The state is in disorder. The boy is\ninterested in philosophy. Here is a chance for you to apply all you've mastered. Plato\nhad argued, after all, that virtuous, philosophically trained men might just manage\nan enduring and just rule. “I pondered the matter,” Plato wrote. “And was in two\nminds as to whether | ought to listen to entreaties and go, or how I ought to act.\nFinally the scale turned in favor of the view that, if ever anyone was to try to carry\nout in practice my ideas about laws and constitutions, now was the time.”\n\nFrom an early age Plato had been bred - by family position and by temperament - to\nhandle the tools of power. “In my youth | went through the same experience as\nmany other men,” he once wrote. “I fancied that if, early in life, | became my own\nmaster, I should at once embark on a political career.” The first taste came\nunexpectedly. In 404 BC, the Athenian constitution collapsed under the shuddering\npressure of Sparta’s victory in the Peloponnesian War. The city-state dipped near\nchaos and a group of pro-Spartan men welded themselves into a hasty joint\ndictatorship. Among them were Plato’s relatives and friends of his family. “They at\nonce invited me to share in their doings, as something to which I had a claim,” Plato\nwrote. He was 20. “The effect on me was not surprising in the case of a young man. |\nconsidered that they would, of course, so manage the State as to bring men out ofa\nbad way of life into a good one. I watched them very closely to see what they would\ndo.” In short order Plato’s friends and family unblinkingly implemented one of the\nmost violent, merciless power mechanisms in Athenian history. They did it with\nabsolute confidence and unrelenting brutality. “In quite a short time,” he wrote\nmany years later, “they had made the former government seem by comparison\nsomething precious as gold.”\n\nThis bitter experience of power was nearly enough to turn Plato from politics, but as\nyou read the story of his life you find he is constantly drawn to the greatest of\n\nhuman experiments - the ordering of our lives. He knew it as the troubling\nmanagement of politikos and the handling of the boiling pot of what he called\n\n198\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018430",
