W. against you has?”\n\nThe matters addressed in these questions were the central focus of Epstein’s claims\nagainst Edwards. lEpstein’s refusal to answer these and literally every other\nsubstantive question put to him in discovery deprived Edwards of even a basic\nunderstanding of the evidence alleged to support claims against him and substantiated\nEdwards’ position that no such evidence ever existed. Epstein’s case was doomed to\nfail on the basis of the “sword and shield” doctrine alone. But other grounds were\nequally and independently fatal to Epstein’s attempt to use the legal system to scare\nEdwards into submission.\n\nAll of Edwards’ conduct in the prosecution of valid claims against Epstein was\nprotected by the absolute bar of the litigation privilege.\n\nAnd most fundamentally, Epstein’s claims against Edwards were not only unsupported\nby but also directly contradicted by all of the record evidence. From the beginning,\nEdwards diligently represented three victims of sexual assaults perpetrated by Epstein.\nEach and every one of Edwards’s litigation decisions was grounded in proper\nlitigation judgment about the need to pursue effective discovery against Epstein,\nparticularly in the face of Epstein’s stonewalling tactics. Edwards’s successful\nrepresentation finally forced Epstein to settle and pay appropriate damages. Effective\nand proper representation of child victims who have been repeatedly sexually\nassaulted cannot form the basis of a separate, “satellite” lawsuit, and therefore\nEdwards was entitled to summary judgment on those grounds as well.\n\nFacing these insurmountable obstacles, on the eve of the scheduled hearing on\nEdwards’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Epstein dismissed all of his claims against\nEdwards.\n\nPut simply, Epstein made allegations that he knew were baseless, that he never\nintended to try to support, and that were precluded as.a matter of well-established-law.\nHis lawsuit was merely a desperate measure by a Serial pedophile to prevent being\nheld accountable for repeatedly sexually abusing minor females. Epstein’s ulterior\nmotives in filing and prosecuting his lawsuit are blatantly obvious. Epstein's behavior\nis another clear demonstration that he feels he lives above the law and that because of\nhis wealth he can manipulate the system and pay for lawyers to do his dirty work -\neven to the extent of having them assert baseless claims against other members of the\nFlorida Bar. Epstein’s Complaint against Edwards was nothing short of a far-fetched,\nfictional fairy-tale with absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support his preposterous\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029317",
