  "text": "That is when I made the decision to take the trip and bought a one-way ticket to Europe. I started\nplanning my adventures and eliminating my physical and psychological baggage. None of my disasters\ncame to pass, and my life has been a near fairy tale since. The business did better than ever, and I\npractically forgot about it as it financed my travels around the world in style for 15 months.\n\nUncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism\n\nThere’s no difference between a pessimist who says, “Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing\nanything,’ and an optimist who says, “Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine\nanyway.” Either way, nothing happens.\n\n—YVON CHOUINARDZ founder of Patagonia\n\nFE... comes in many forms, and we usually don’t call it by its four-letter name. Fear itself is quite fear-\n\ninducing. Most intelligent people in the world dress it up as something else: optimistic denial. Most who\navoid quitting their jobs entertain the thought that their course will improve with time or increases in\nincome. This seems valid and is a tempting hallucination when a job is boring or uninspiring instead of\npure hell. Pure hell forces action, but anything less can be endured with enough clever rationalization.\n\nDo you really think it will improve or is it wishful thinking and an excuse for inaction? If you were\nconfident in improvement, would you really be questioning things so? Generally not. This is fear of the\nunknown disguised as optimism.\n\nAre you better off than you were one year ago, one month ago, or one week ago?\n\nIf not, things will not improve by themselves. If you are kidding yourself, it is time to stop and plan\nfor a jump. Barring any James Dean ending, your life is going to be LONG. Nine to five for your\nworking lifetime of 40-50 years is a long-ass time if the rescue doesn’t come. About 500 months of solid\nwork.\n\nHow many do you have to go? It’s probably time to cut your losses.\n\nSomeone Call the Maitre D’\n\nYou have comfort. You don’t have luxury. And don’t tell me that money plays a part. The\nluxury I advocate has nothing to do with money. It cannot be bought. It is the reward of those\nwho have no fear of discomfort.\n\n—JEAN COCTEAU, French poet, novelist, boxing manager, and filmmaker, whose\ncollaborations were the inspiration for the term “surrealism”\n\nS ometimes timing is perfect. There are hundreds of cars circling a parking lot, and someone pulls out\n\nof a spot 10 feet from the entrance just as you reach his or her bumper. Another Christmas miracle!\n\nOther times, the timing could be better. The phone rings during sex and seems to ring for a half hour.\nThe UPS guy shows up 10 minutes later. Bad timing can spoil the fun.\n\nJean-Marc Hachey landed in West Africa as a volunteer, with high hopes of lending a helping hand. In\nthat sense, his timing was great. He arrived in Ghana in the early 1980s, in the middle of a coup d’état, at\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013826",
