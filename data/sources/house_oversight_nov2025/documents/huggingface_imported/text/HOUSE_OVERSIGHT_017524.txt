The times they are a-changin’

Which global events in the first years of this century will appear
in future textbooks of history? My first bet is a gradual change
that came about without headlines. When I was born in 1948
we were less than one billion children in the world. Today there
are almost two billion aged 0-15 years. The game-changing
event in the first decade of this century was that the number of
children stopped growing. Two-child families are now the norm
for 80% of mankind. The fast population growth will be over
around 2050 and at that point only 10% of the 10 billion in the
world will live in what was the West. Demographics are major
changers of the market place.

My second bet is the G20 meeting in Washington 2008.
As the richest needed to borrow money they asked the emerging
economies to join and changed their name from G7 to G20.
‘The official photo of the heads of state tells the story. In the
middle stands the host, President George W. Bush. On his right
is President da Silva and on his left President Jintao and King
Abdulla, most probably placed according to their ability to lend
money to US in the time of crisis. We know of the lending from
Saudi and China. But Brazil has on its own been lending US
about 30 billion USD per year since 2008. The economic
strength of the world is shifting.

What do the ongoing tectonic shifts in demographics
and economy mean for the future of frontline medical research?
Will basic medical research be the last to globalize as it requires
a unique functional combination of venture capital, institutions
and creative individuals? Or will we see tectonic shifts in how

the world does basic medical research already in the next

decade?
