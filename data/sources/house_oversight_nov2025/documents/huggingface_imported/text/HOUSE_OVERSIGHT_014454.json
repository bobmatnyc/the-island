  "text": "Appendix 1: Methodology\n\nThis publication is aimed at multi-asset institutional investors who tend to have a longer\nterm time horizon for their investments. As such, we will be looking to come up with\nideas that will have a minimum six month horizon and ideally longer than a year. The\nindividual trade ideas will be sourced from our strategists across BofA Merrill Lynch\nGlobal Research.\n\nThis publication is not meant to be an agglomeration of all the trade ideas published by\nBofAML Global Research strategists, but instead represents those that fit with our\nlonger term themes (as opposed to shorter term tactical trades). In addition, there may\nbe several different trade ideas published by BofAML Global Research strategists across\ndifferent asset classes that seek to leverage off of the same theme. In most cases we\nwill seek merely to take the trades that have the best risk adjusted return. By risk\nadjusted we mean the risk undertaken in a trade vs the likely return on that trade. In\nconsidering that we will look at the underlying volatility in the individual asset class. This\nwill be combined with our own view of what the likely downside is in an adverse\nscenario vs the payoff in the expected scenario and our own assessment of the\nlikelihoods of such scenarios.\n\nOnce selected it is assumed that the trade would likely be retained for a minimum of six\nmonths (as per the selection rationale). Should any analyst change their view on the trade\nand cease to recommend it, then it will be immediately removed from our list’. Equally\nshould our target be met for a trade and the relevant strategist feels it has run its course\nthen it will also be removed (see footnote). Otherwise we will review our trades on a\nmonthly basis in this publication. If we feel a new trade idea has a better risk adjusted\nreturn than an existing one in the same asset class then we would replace it.\n\nThe objective of the trades is that they would be suitable for a typical objective of the\nmulti-asset fund managers, which is typically framed in terms of a Libor+ benchmark\n(this can be anything from Libor +300bp to Libor +700bp). That return is also coupled\nwith a target volatility, for example half MSCI ACWI volatility. The volatility target will,\nof course, be a function of the expected return, but there is a general focus on\nproducing lower volatility returns. Our set of trades should not be regarded as a\nportfolio but a collection of ideas to implement in a multi-asset portfolio.\n\nAppendix 2 - Recommended COCO bonds\n\nTable 4: COCO basket\n\nISIN Bond Issuing entity Price Mid YtM\nXS$1055037177 ACAFP 6.5% EUR Perp-21 CREDIT AGRICOLE SA 100.5 54\nXS$1002801758 BACR 8% EUR Perp-20 BARCLAYS PLC 100.9 a\nXS$1033661866 BBVASM 7% EUR Perp-19 BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARG 91.1 al\nX$1073143932 NYKRE 4% EUR 2036-21 NYKREDIT REALKREDIT AS 102.4 2f\nXS0972523947 CS 5.75% EUR 2025-20 CREDIT SUISSE 107.6 3.6\nDEO00DB/XHP3 DB 6% EUR Perp-22 DEUTSCHE BANK AG 18.3 67\nXS$1043545059 | LLOYDS 6.375% EUR Perp-20 | LLOYDS BANKING GROUP PLC 97.5 57\nXS$1171914515 | RABOBK 5.5% EUR Perp-20 | COOPERATIEVE RABOBANK UA 98.5 5.5\nXS0867620725 | SOCGEN 6.75% EUR Perp-21 SOCIETE GENERALE 98.8 5.9\nXS1107890847 | UCGIM 6.75% EUR Perp-21 UNICREDIT SPA 84.5 if\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research *As of 28/11/2016 close\n\n| Under these circumstances, we will publish a note immediately.\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Global Cross Asset Strategy - Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 23\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014454",
