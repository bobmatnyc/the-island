  "text": "in declaring that this so-called sequester\nthreatens the military as well as domestic\nprograms. But his plan to avoid it basically\nrepeated the offer of a “balanced approach”\n— unspecified tax hikes and spending cuts\n— which Republicans have already\nrejected.\n\nSomewhat more substantively, he called for\na larger deficit-reduction deal built around\nloophole-closing tax reform and what he\ncalled “modest” reforms to Medicare and\nentitlements. In an apparent effort to rally\nDemocrats to this cause, he called on\n“those of us who care deeply about\nprograms like Medicare” to “embrace”\nreform.\n\nYet in promising the same amount of\nMedicare savings as the Simpson-Bowles\ncommision proposed, Mr. Obama did not\nmention that this would be a mere $341\nbillion over 10 years. All told, he envisions\nshaving an additional $1.5 trillion off\nprojected deficits over 10 years, which\nwould leave the national debt at a\nhistorically aberrant 70-odd percent of\ngross domestic product. In short, he\ndeclined to push back against the mind-set\nwithin his party that considers acceptable\n“stabilizing” the debt at this level by the\ntime Mr. Obama’s second term ends. At\nbest, that would buy a respite of a few\nyears before the debt resumed its upward\nclimb.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025042",
