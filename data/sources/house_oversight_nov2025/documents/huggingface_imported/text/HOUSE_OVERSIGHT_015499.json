In some cases, existing cancer drugs can simply\nbe repurposed, such as discover-\ning that an immunosuppressant\ndrug works for certain bladder\ncancers. Or 1t might mean find-\ning new life for an experimental\ndrug that had been abandoned.\nIf Conley and Doroshow can\npinpoint who might be helped\nby an abandoned drug, a phar-\nmaceutical company might\nhave to do just one or two fur-\nther studies to get that drug\napproved for routine use.\n\nThe future might look some-\nthing like what’s been gomg on\nfor several years at the Genome\nInstitute of Washington Univer-\nsity, where genome sequenc-\ning 1s being used to help people\nwith relapsed cancers and who\nhave run out of options. The\nproject puts insights from stud-\nies like Solit’s into practice, analyzing a patient’s tumor\nto determine whether currently available drugs might\ntarget the troublemaker mutations. Combining whole\ngenome sequencing, exome sequencing, and RNA\nexpression analysis—what Washington University pro-\nfessor of genetics and Genome Institute co-director\nElaine Mardis calls the “Maserati approach”—the team\ncompares a comprehensive genetic profile against a\ndatabase of drugs that target specific gene variants,\nlooking for a match.\n\nIf there is a match, the results can be impressive,\nas was the case with a young Washington University\ndoctor with leukemia, Lukas Wartman, who had suf-\nfered two relapses. In his case, analysis revealed that\na gene called FLT3 was expressing more RNA than\nnormal. A drug that inhibits this gene, usually used in\n\n39\n\nkidney cancer, sent his cancer into remission. Wash-\nington University now has a special genetic test for\npatients with his type of leukemia.\n\nJust recently, Solit’s group solved another excep-\ntional responder mystery—a case of ureteral cancer\neliminated with a combination of old and new drugs.\nThe old drug is a standard chemotherapy treatment\nthat prevents DNA from unwinding, which it must do\nin order to duplicate itself dur-\ning cell division. The new one\nsensitizes cells to the effects of\nradiation. This patient tumed\nout to have a mutation in RADSO,\ninvolved in repairing broken\nDNA strands (badly repaired\nDNA can lead to uncontrolled\ncancerous growth). Here, too,\nthe outlier finding may lead to\na new treatment, since about\n4 percent of the other tumors\nSolit has looked at have muta-\ntions that affect part of the\nRAD50 complex. “To look at\nthese individuals’ cancers can\ntell us a lot more than just a\nrandom case of cancer,” says\nSolit. “There’s a phenotype—a\nresponse—that gives you infor-\nmation about the genes.”\n\nSolit is now making a quick,\nreliable test for the TSC1 mutation to single out people\nwith bladder cancer who might be helped by everoli-\nmus, and 1s planning a new study to test the drug in\nthem. And the original outlier, the woman with blad-\nder cancer? Three years later, she’s still on everolimus\nand still having a “complete response,” Solit says. She’s\ndoingfine. ©\n\nkat mcgowan is acontributing editor at Discover magazine\nand an independent journalist based in Berkeley, Calif.,\nand New York City.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015499",
