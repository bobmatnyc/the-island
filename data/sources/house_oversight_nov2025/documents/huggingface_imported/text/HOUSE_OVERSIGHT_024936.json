  "text": "employees who do not have roles to play during this situation. I am not sure why people are expecting a peak in\nthe coming months. The whole process is a restructuring course that was well received by all Dubai Holding\nemployees.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, Dubai was accused in the media that laid-off Arabs descend from a\nspecific nationality, what is the reality?\n\nRumors feed on human emotion. Verifiable facts, and even simple common sense, have little or nothing to do\nwith the way a rumor spreads. I would say that due to the steep global crisis effect on domains such as PR and\nadvertising, which employ by coincidence a large number from a particular nationality, or the construction\nsector which also employs a large number of architects from one nationality, there is absolutely no focus on\nlaying off any Arab or non-Arab nationality.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, your recent visit to Russia complements your strategy in visiting the\nstrong economic countries worldwide such as Germany and China last year. Do you\nthink that these visits are still useful nowadays? Are you planning to20continue this\napproach and what is the objective of those visits? What was the outcome of your last\nvisit to Moscow?\n\nThis is a strange question. We are pretty sure that this crisis will not last forever, and that it will end. The UAE\nhas always had good relations with all countries around the world and especially the weighty economic\ncountries. Our duty is to work toward developing and enhancing those relationships. In fact, during global\ncrisis countries should broaden those visits and enhance their bilateral relations especially since this crisis may\nresult in forming a new economic and political world construct.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, do you think that the current crisis would impose new changes on the\nfederal and local levels in the UAE as rumors are spreading regarding a change in\nprogress in the cabinet?\n\nIt is obvious that things do change. Whoever does not take up the new situation and cooperate positively with it\nfor the benefit of the nation and nationals would be incompetent. However, it is you who’s saying that there are\nrumors that a change in the cabinet is under way.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, people who are aware of the relationship between Dubai and Abu Dhabi\nsay that there is no need to worry about the effect of the crisis on Dubai because it relies at\nthe end of the day on the financial strength of Abu Dhabi, which owns the biggest\nsovereign fund in the world. What would you say?\n\nThose people know well that they can’t bracket the relationship between both Emirates into just a financial\nrelation. The money element is a very minimal component in a superior relationship built on family ties with a\nunity soul, with “tolerance” essence and foundation concurred by both Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid on 18\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024936",
