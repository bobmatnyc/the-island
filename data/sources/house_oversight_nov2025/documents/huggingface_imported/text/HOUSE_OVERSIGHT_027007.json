  "text": "Operations on these representations include reinforcement\nlearning and classification, perceptual top-down/bottom-up\nprocessing, abstraction, analogy formation, associative and\nsyllogistic reasoning, planning, reflection, anticipation and\nseveral modes of reorganization.\n\nCreating a scientific community\n\nThe Comprehension\nChallenge\n\nThe task of the Structure of Mental Representation initiative will\nat first consist in the creation of a large and competitive\ncommunity, built around a set of benchmark problems.\n\nI suggest picking a set of problems that covers most of the\nabove architectural requirements: the comprehension of\ndynamic visual sequences (movies) and narratives. The\nevaluation of comprehension may focus both on a discourse\nlevel (asking the system general and specific questions about\nthe consumed visuals or narratives) and directly, by producing\ndynamic renderings and depictions of knowledge represented\nwithin the system. At least on the discourse level, a direct\ncomparison to the functional properties of child performance\nat different cognitive stages is possible.\n\nTurning the benchmark task into a regular competition allows a\ndirect comparison between models, and offers a strong\nincentive for exchange of solutions among research groups. The\nneed to for broad solutions with given material and intellectual\nresources will enforce a higher degree of the reuse of code and\nideas than we currently see in AJ architectures (outside of\nrobotic soccer, where such competitions have turned out to be\nhighly successful).\n\nBy structuring the comprehension tasks into different levels\nand sub-domains (such as basic language acquisition tasks,\ngrammar, perceptual and logical tasks, social reasoning/theory\nof mind, affective evaluation, constructive problem solving, use\nof analogies and metaphor etc.), we can formulate consistent\nlong-term goals and realistic short-term problems.\n\nThe Formation of a Pilot Team\n\nTo pull the Structure of Mental Representation initiative off the\nground, we will need to create a pilot team, which is the object\nof this proposal. The pilot team has the following tasks:\n\n- Bring a critically sized group of people together, with a\nwell-defined set of shared goals\n\n- Formulate an initial set of hypotheses\n\n- Bring these in the context of an existing or hypothetical\ncognitive architecture, so specifications can be derived\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027007",
