  "text": "Last week Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin stated that he expects an\nexpanded partnership between Ukraine and NATO will lead Ukraine to a\nmembership in the Alliance following a path similar to that of Montenegro.\n\nWith regard to the United States, for now President Trump’s ambiguous\npositioning in Russian affairs seems to have little impact on the U.S.\nAdministration's Ukraine policy. The Administration is expected to continue its\nsupport for the actions of NATO, the IMF and Secretary of State Tillerson has\nreaffirmed in April 2017 that the U.S. will not lift sanctions against Russia as long\nPresident Putin does not hand Crimea back to Kiev.\n\nIn internal politics, we would expect Mr Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, to\nsign the Association Agreement, thus improving his diminishing ratings and to\nwin the presidential elections in 2019. In my opinion, Mr Poroshenko is also\ndelaying the elections in the conflict zone of Donbass, a major requirement\nfeatured in the Minsk Agreement, in order to avoid the negation of his good\nperformance on the European prospect, and then, assessing the Russian conflict\nsituation at that point in time, to progress with the Minsk Agreement and\neffectively resolve a major part of the conflict. I do not think that Crimea will ever\nfind its way back to Ukraine but if all other matters are resolved, a financial\nsettlement would be considered.\n\nTherefore the status of “frozen conflict” in the Donbass area would remain in the\nshort to medium term but the economy of Ukraine has been operating for a number\nof years now without the Donbass and the annexed to Russia Crimea. All growth\nestimates published by various international institutes incorporate similar\nassumptions.\n\nBanking Sector\n\nIn the past 3 years there has been a clean-up by the National bank of Ukraine\n(NBU) with the support of IMF mainly as well as of EBRD and IFC. The number\nof banks has been reduced from 192 to 92 and there are still banks that will be\nliquidated. The most drastic action was the nationalisation of Privatbank, the\nbiggest bank in the country (market share 17.7% by assets, 36% of deposits of\nphysical persons), owned by an oligarch that was posing a systemic risk to the\ncountry’s economy and which was found to be insolvent mainly because of bad\nlending practices with loans extended to related parties. However, Privatbank is\nservicing 20 million customers providing to them state-of-the-art digital banking\n\n5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026138",
