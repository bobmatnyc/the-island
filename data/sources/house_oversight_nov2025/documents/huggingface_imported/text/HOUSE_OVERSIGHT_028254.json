  "text": "/ BARAK / 120\n\ncapable to taking over Gaza. But what then, I asked. Unless we were prepared to\nresume open-ended Israeli control, we’d be left with no one to run Gaza\nafterwards. The obvious candidate, Egypt, was even less interested than we were in\nassuming responsibility for the more than one-and-a-half million Palestinians who\nlived there. I doubted that even Arafat would have been ready to do so. But\nrelations had only worsened, since his death in 2004, between the Fatah old guard\nin the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank and the Hamas overlords in Gaza. I\ndoubted very much that Abu Mazen would want to get involved. I did send an aide\nto see him to ask whether, in principle, he was open to reassuming control of Gaza\nfollowing an Israeli takeover. His answer was unsurprising and unequivocal: no.\n\nI secured cabinet support for the more limited aim of restoring a period of calm\nfor Israeli citizens in the south. I said the military operation had to be as sharp and\nshort as possible, and end with some kind of political understanding that the\nrockets would stop for a significant period of time. The final plan was presented to\nministers a few days before the operation. It would begin with surprise air strikes\nand a naval bombardment, followed by a limited ground incursion to hit remaining\nHamas targets outside of the major refugee camps, which I was determined to\navoid. The whole operation was intended to last for two weeks at the most.\nHopefully, closer to a week, with diplomatic efforts through Egypt to secure a\nlasting cease-fire and, ideally, prevent Hamas from resupplying its rocket\nstockpiles through its smuggling tunnels from the Sinai.\n\nWhen we launched Operation Cast Lead on the morning of December 27,\nnearly all the Hamas forces were where we’d expected them to be. Two waves of\nair strikes, with over a hundred jets and attack helicopters, killed 350 Hamas\nfighters. We destroyed Hamas’s headquarters and dozens of its government and\npolice installations. The attacks continued in the days that followed. We took a\nrange of actions designed to minimize civilian casualties. We dropped leaflets\nbefore bombing sorties, phoned residents, and fired light missiles before heavier\nordnance was used. Still, I realized that civilian casualties were unavoidable — if\nonly because Hamas, like Hizbollah in Lebanon, was deliberately firing its rockets\nfrom civilian areas, sometimes even near schools or hospitals. Civilian casualties\nwere obviously tragic in themselves. They also made it inevitable that the longer\nthe operation went on, the more likely we were to face international criticism, and\ndiplomatic pressure to bring it to an end. That was an additional reason I had\ninsisted that the operation be well defined and time-limited.\n\n406\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028254",
