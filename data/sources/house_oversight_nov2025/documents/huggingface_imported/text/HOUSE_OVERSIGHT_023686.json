  "text": "CHINA DAILY Wednesday, October 18, 2017\n\nG Five years on\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\n\nHistorical starting point for new stage of development\n\nhe 19th National Congress of the\n\nCommunist Party of China,\n\nwhich begins on October 18, will\n\nset the leadership and establish\nthe policies for the next five years, at least.\nWhile Party national congresses are\nalways seminal events in the political life\nof the country, there is reason to expect\nthat this congress will have even greater\nand longer-reaching impact.\n\nThe context of the 19th\nCPC National Congress is\nthe grand vision for Chi-\nna presented by CPC\nCentral Committee Gen-\neral Secretary Xi Jinping,\nwho is now the “core” of\n“the CPC Central Com-\nmittee and of the whole\nParty” It is an epic narra-\ntive of what China has\nremarkably achieved, what China has yet to\ndo, and what China envisages as necessary\nto become a great nation.\n\nXi’s grand vision is famously expressed as\n“the Chinese Dream’; described as “the\ngreat rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’,\nwhich has personal and national implica-\ntions. It is specified by two overarching\ngoals: the two centenary goals of establish-\ning a moderately prosperous society by\n2020 — the 100th anniversary of the CPC is\n2021 — and establishing China as a “fully\nmodernized, socialist nation” by the 100th\nanniversary of the People’s Republic of Chi-\nna in 2049.\n\nThe first goal, which includes the total\nelimination of extreme poverty in the coun-\ntry, will likely be achieved within the five-\nyear term of the 19th CPC National\nCongress. It is the second goal that is of spe-\ncial interest at this time, because in drawing\nthe roadmap and formulating the policies\nto achieve China’s mid-century goal, this\nCongress may set the agenda for the next\n30-plus years.\n\nThe CPC national congresses are the\nhighest authority of CPC governance and\ndecision-making. The CPC constitutional\nprovision of holding congresses every five\nyears was reaffirmed by Deng Xiaoping in\nthe early days of reform (in part to establish\norder and collective responsibility after a\nperiod of chaos and political vicissitudes),\nand since 1982, Party congresses have been\nheld scrupulously on schedule.\n\nThe congresses establish the senior lead-\nership of the Party and hence the nation by\nelecting the CPC Central Committee, which\nin turn elects all top Party positions, and\nalso the Central Commission for Discipline\nInspection; review and assess the achieve-\nments and challenges over the five years\nsince the previous Party Congress; set the\nvision, goals and objectives, agenda and pri-\norities for the subsequent five years; revise\nthe Party constitution (to keep up with the\ntimes); and project an image of unified pur-\npose and direction to engender national\nconfidence and commitment.\n\nThe review and assessment of the previ-\nous five years and setting the agenda and\npriorities for the subsequent five years are\nformally presented in the Report, delivered\nby the general secretary representing the\noutgoing Central Committee and thus\nreflecting the consensus view of the Party\nleadership. Ratified by the congress (after\nminor modifications), it becomes the guid-\ning document that drives policy for the\nincoming Central Committee.\n\nOn the day following a congress, the first\nplenum of the new 19th Central Committee\nis convened to elect the Party’s new senior\nleadership, including the Political Bureau,\nthe Standing Committee of the Political\nBureau (to which, in essence, everything in\nChina reports), and the general secretary of\nthe Central Committee. Also approved are\nthe Central Military Commission (which\noversees the People’s Liberation Army), the\nSecretariat (which runs Party daily opera-\ntions), and the head of the Central Commis-\nsion for Discipline Inspection.\n\nThe planning for the national Party Con-\ngress follows similar patterns. Beginning\nmore than a year in advance, it involves\nboth formal and informal processes. The\nformal process includes the election or\nappointment of about 2,300 delegates\n(2,280 delegates at the 19th National Con-\ngress) from among the Party’s over 89 mil-\nlion members, at all levels and in all sectors,\nand the preparation of the Report via an\nelaborate system of extensive research in\ntargeted areas (involving thousands of\nexperts), solicitation of broad input, drafts\n(or sections) circulated to numerous Party\nexperts and officials for comments, and iter-\native intense reviews by higher bodies and\nsenior leaders. In addition, smaller groups\nare assigned the more sensitive tasks of\namending the Party constitution and rec-\ncommending candidates for the new Central\nCommittee and senior leadership positions.\n\nFinal decisions for this year’s congress, as\nwell as final edits of the Report, were made\nat the Seventh Plenum of the 18th CPC Cen-\ntral Committee, held on Oct 11 to 14, days\nprior to the opening ceremony of the 19th\nCPC National Congress.\n\nTo understand the position and role of\nCPC Central Committee General Secretary\nXi at the 19th Party National Congress, we\nshould appreciate what it means for Xi to\n\nRobert\nLawrence Kuhn\n\nbe the core. It was in October 2016, at the\nSixth Plenum of the 18th CPC Central Com-\nmittee, that Xi was designated the “core” of\nthe CPC Central Committee and of the\nentire Party. The appellation was an unam-\nbiguous assertion that China requires\nstrong leadership to maintain stability and\nensure development given China’s unprece-\ndented, complex challenges: domestically,\nslower growth, industrial overcapacity,\nendemic pollution, unbalanced develop-\nment, income disparity, social injustice,\nsocial service demands; and internationally,\nregional conflicts, sluggish economies, vola-\ntile markets, trade protectionism, ethnic\nclashes, terrorism, geopolitical rivalries, and\nterritorial disputes.\n\nMoreover, because China must deepen\nreform to achieve the goal of being a moder-\nately prosperous society, the resistance of\nentrenched interest groups must be over-\ncome. In fact, the necessity of having a lead-\nership core to maintain stability and\nexpedite reform was a primary factor relat-\ning to Xi’s elevation to be the core.\n\nIn addition, not only does Xi have the\nresponsibility for China’s transformation;\nhe is also accountable for it. He has shown\ncourage in combating rampant practice of\ngraft, bribery and illicit patronage. Xi’s\nrelentless anti-corruption campaign is\naltering how officials in government and\nmanagers in industry work, and even how\nthey think. And let no one assume that Xi’s\nbattle against corruption has been risk-free.\n\nXi as the core does not change the Party's\ncardinal principle of “democratic central-\nism” The Party says it is encouraging the\ndemocratic solicitation of input and feed-\nback from Party members, lower-ranked\nofficials, and the general public; and\nstrengthening centralism through Xi’s core\nleadership.\n\nIn acomplex world, given the diverse\ninterests and forces in Chinese society, the\nParty asserts that the Chinese Dream can-\nnot be realized without unity. Strong leader-\nship is required to build and maintain unity\nfor China to continue its development.\n\nWhen Xi received the core appellation, he\nwas already general secretary of the Party,\nchairman of the Central Military Commis-\nsion, and president of the country — the\nthree highest leadership positions in China\n— so how does being the “core” augment his\nperceived stature or actual power?\n\nThe 2016 Party plenum communique\nconfirmed that “the collective leadership\nsystem ... must always be adhered to”,\nNonetheless, there must have been shifts in\nterms of both the setting of the agenda and\nmaking final decisions — or else making Xi\nthe core would have little meaning.\n\nWhen foreigners dismiss the political\naphorisms of China’s leaders as simplistic\nsloganeering, they miss an opportunity to\nenrich their understanding. Chinese offi-\ncials certainly hold Xi’s frameworks in high\nesteem.\n\nXi’s thought for the Party, the inner-Party\ndirectives, include the “eight regulations”\n(against waste and perks); “four self-confi-\ndences” (in the country’s development path,\n\nThe China model, Xi\nsaid, successful at home,\nalso broadens the way\nfor developing countries\nto modernize, thus\nproviding Chinese\nwisdom and Chinese\nsolutions for problems\nfacing mankind.\n\ntheories, systems, culture of socialism with\nChinese characteristics); opposing the “four\nevil winds” (formalism, bureaucracy,\nhedonism, decadence); the “four greats”\n(struggles, projects, enterprises, dreams).\n\nThe combined intent is to make Party\nmembers, especially Party and government\nofficials, more dedicated, committed, com-\npetent and loyal, with exemplary moral\nstandards of probity and rectitude. It is no\nsmall order.\n\nThe Party’s unremitting anti-corruption\ncampaign, unprecedented under Xi, has\nwon strong public support and will certain-\nly continue. But some foreign analysts mis-\ntakenly see Xi’s anti-corruption campaign\nas largely a tool of political power, thus\nreflecting a superficial and one-dimension-\nal understanding of China. Befitting the size\nand complexity of the country, for almost\nevery decision of importance, China’s lead-\ners have multiple motivations.\n\nFor the anti-corruption campaign, these\nmotivations include respect for the rule of\nlaw and judicial impartiality; effective func-\ntioning of the Party devoid of personal\ninterests; public trust in the Party; efficient\neconomic resource allocations (corruption\ndistorts markets); expediting reform (by\nbreaking up “interest groups” that resist\nreform); maintaining national unity (by\nremoving officials with non-standard politi-\ncal ambitions); elevating morality of Chi-\nnese society; restoring ethical standards of\nChinese civilization; and facilitating China’s\nemergence as a world-business center and\nglobal role model.\n\nXi’s thought for the country — his new\nideas, new strategies, new initiatives set\nforth over the past five years — can be\nencapsulated as the overall vision of the\n“Five in One” construction (economic, polit-\nical, cultural, social, ecological); governance\nof the country via his “Four Comprehen-\nsives” (a moderately prosperous society;\ndeepening reform, strengthening the rule of\nlaw, strictly governing the Party); and\nrenewed economic development via the\nFive Major Development Concepts (innova-\ntion, coordination, green, open, sharing),\nplus “supply-side structural reform’,\n\nXi’s thought for national rejuvenation\nincludes a grand vision for global govern-\nance, consisting of eight big diplomatic con-\ncepts: a global community of shared destiny\nand future; win-win cooperation; economic\nglobalization; fairer global governance; a\nnew kind of major power relationship;\nexpanding cooperation while managing dif-\nferences; multilateralism; and people-to-\npeople exchanges. Moreover, Xi’s Belt and\nRoad Initiative — facilitating economic\ndevelopment in developing countries, espe-\ncially by building much-needed infrastruc-\nture — is China's “project of the century”,\n\nChina recognizes it has international\nresponsibilities and seeks to uphold a com-\nmon, comprehensive, cooperative and sus-\ntainable security strategy. China’s own.\nrequirement is to protect the country’s\nthree sacrosanct “core interests” — its polit-\nical system, economic development, and\nnational sovereignty (territorial integrity).\n\nChina appreciates that to be a major\ncountry, with its political influence reflect-\ning its economic strength, and also to pro-\ntect its own core interests, its diplomacy\nmust be pro-active. China does not claim\nthat its “China model” can be adopted by\nother countries, but the world should\nunderstand Xi’s principles of governance as\noptimally suited for China’s domestic condi-\ntions.\n\nParty congresses have similar styles and\nto casual observers, they can all seem much\nthe same. But they do have differences,\nwhich are usually subtle and often mean-\ningful.\n\nFor the 19th National Congress, some of\nthe things to look out for are:\n\nAre political frameworks and policies\nstated in their expected forms? If so, confi-\ndence in political and economic stability is\nreinforced.\n\nHow is General Secretary Xi Jinping’s sta-\ntus as “core” further stressed, as expected?\n\nWho are the members of the new Stand-\ning Committee of the Political Bureau and.\nwhat are their portfolios?\n\nAssuming the Party Constitution is\namended to include Xi’s new ideas, new\nstrategies, new initiatives, will they be given\nan overarching label?\n\nWhat is the composition of the new Cen-\ntral Committee?\n\nIn listing the essential economic, politi-\ncal, cultural, social and ecological policies,\nare there shifts of emphasis that, however\nnuanced, suggest changing priorities?\n\nFor deepening reform, surely stressed,\nwhat targets are specified? For example,\nwhat will be stated explicitly about State-\nowned enterprise reform?\n\nEnvironmental protection is a high prior-\nity, but what specific regulations and\nenhanced enforcements distinguish the\nfight against pollution under Xi from those\nof previous congresses?\n\nMany social areas will be highlighted —\nfor example, education, healthcare, rural\nland reform, migrant worker residencies —\nbut do any stand out?\n\nAs already affirmed, the anti-corruption\ncampaign will continue, but will its intensi-\n\nSHI YU / CHINA DAILY\n\nty or direction change in any manner, will it\nbe institutionalized? How will the forth-\ncoming National Supervisory Commission\nwork?\n\nWhat is the relative prominence of mili-\ntary reform and modernization?\n\nWhat is the relative prominence of inter-\nnational affairs, given the high-profile Belt\nand Road Initiative and China’s intense,\npro-active diplomacy?\n\nForecasting the 19th CPC National Con-\ngress is not all guesswork and triangulating\nrumors. Following tradition, Xi offered to\nParty leaders a preview of his Report.\nSpeaking on July 26, he outlined China’s\nachievements since the previous national\ncongress: new concepts of development,\ndeepened reform, enhanced rule of law,\nstrengthened environmental protection,\nand a more capable military.\n\nChina, Xi said, has, after suffering centu-\nry-long hardships and tribulations, taken\nthree historic leaps, from standing-up to\nbecoming better-off to becoming stronger.\nXi called for a comprehensive, strategic and\nforward-looking action program, highlight-\ning the success and vitality of socialism with\nChinese characteristics, the increasing\nstrength of the Party, and China’s expanding\ncircle of friends in the international com-\nmunity. In China, he stressed, political legit-\nimacy is founded on competence and\naccomplishment.\n\nSignificantly, Xi asserted that China’s\ndevelopment stands at a new historic start-\ning point and that socialism with Chinese\ncharacteristics is entering a new develop-\nment stage. The CPC cannot rest on its lau-\nrels, he stressed. The country faces daunting\nchallenges. He warned the Party against\nself-satisfaction and blind optimism.\n\nXi’s comments resonated with his core\nvalues and bear witness to his consistency.\nIn 2006, then Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi\ntold me that China should be proud of its\nsuccesses, but its “achievements should not\nengender complacency’, adding “we need to\nassess ourselves objectively”:\n\nPreparing for the upcoming congress, Xi\nrecognizes that the people's desire for a hap-\npier life is stronger than ever. They want\nbetter education, higher incomes, stable\njobs, reliable social insurance, higher quali-\nty healthcare, more comfortable living con-\nditions, a more beautiful environment and\naricher cultural life.\n\nAnd there has been an inflection point in\nChina’s international perspective, reflecting\nthe nation’s consequential global engage-\nment. The China model, Xi said, successful\nat home, also broadens the way for develop-\ning countries to modernize, thus providing\nChinese wisdom and Chinese solutions for\nproblems facing mankind.\n\nThe influence of the 19th CPC National\nCongress and the impact of Xi Jinping’s\nthought seem for decades to come.\n\nThe author is a public intellectual, interna-\ntional corporate strategist, and China\nexpert/commentator.
