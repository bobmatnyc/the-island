  "text": "Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL\n\nAppendix 1: The Team and Our Process\ne Electron Focus\n\nElectron’s universe of utility and infrastructure stocks is deep, comprising 375 companies with a market\ncap of $2.8 trillion. Stocks covered include the electric, gas, water and waste utilities in addition to\ninfrastructure companies (defined as those levered to utilities or utility-like). Our approach is truly global\nas 40-60% of the portfolio’s historical gross has been allocated outside the US.\n\ne Electron Team\n\nElectron’s cohesive, long-standing team consists of 8 members, including 5 investment professionals who\nhave worked (with Jos Shaver as Portfolio Manager) at SAC Capital and the original Electron Capital for an\naverage of 6 years. In addition, 4 of the 5 investment professionals have lived outside the US, a distinct\ncompetitive advantage given our global approach. Each investment professional brings his/her own\nspecific expertise and diligent research to our process, working collaboratively across regions to conduct\ndeep-dive research on the most compelling opportunities in the global utility sector.\n\nThe other members of Electron complement the skills and experience of the investment team. Electron’s\nexperienced operations/investor relations professionals are former Intrepid Capital employees who\nworked with the Electron team during the first iteration of Electron (2005-2008) when the firm had a\nservices agreement with Intrepid Capital.\n\nFinally, a Senior Advisory Board consisting of former C-level utility executives from around the globe has\nbeen with the team since the launch of the original Electron Capital in 2005, and all have rejoined for\nElectron’s re-launch.\n\nAs Portfolio Manager, Jos Shaver has covered the global utility and infrastructure sectors for the past 21\nyears, and his sector perspective benefits from his having lived 10 years abroad (5 years in Asia covering\nthe Asian utilities and 5 years in Europe covering European utilities) and 11 years in the US. In addition, as\nManaging Partner, Jos controls all major decisions at Electron.\n\ne Track Record (7 years)\n\nElectron’s 7-year track record (3 years audited from the original Electron and 4 years from SAC Capital)\nhas annualized 10.3% since inception and has been characterized by strong alpha generation on both the\nlong and short side (80% of returns, based on Jensen’s alpha calculation). Electron generated this 7-year\ntrack record during an exceptionally challenging period for global utilities — the MSCI World Utility Index\nhas been the worst-performing MSCI Global Sector ex-financials over the track record period, down -0.2%.\nNotwithstanding, Electron’s track record has bested the MSCI World Utility, S&P 500 and HFRI indices by\n91%, 67% and 61%, respectively.\n\ne Process\n\nFirst, given Electron’s global approach to utility research, we tend to have a clear competitive advantage\nwith respect to early recognition of cross-border structural change (e.g., how a change in Asian seaborne\ncoal market might affect off-peak power prices and thus earnings for a Midwest US utility). Moreover,\nour global research approach allows us to gain perspective on structural change outcomes given our\nknowledge of global precedents and the likely reaction from various interested parties (e.g., governments,\nregulators, managements, customers, consumer groups, rating agencies, shareholders, debt holders, et\nal.) We analyze other global precedents, develop a thesis and then conduct deep-dive research to gain\nconviction. Once we have developed a structural change thesis, we proceed to a full bottoms-up analysis\n\n20 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024221",
