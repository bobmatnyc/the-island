  "text": "What is the relevance of this to the\nstory of the social nature of humankind? Our\nresearch findings have led me to believe that\nwe all have made Eddington’s error in the way\nwe have thought about, studied, and tried to\ndeal with an invisible force that motivates us\nto seek and maintain our connection with\nothers — including the loneliness one feels\nwhen we feel important social connections are\nthreatened or absent. Historically, the\nscientific perspective on loneliness was not\nonly that it was a painful and miserable state,\nbut that it was an aversive state with no\nredeeming features. All one needs to do is to\nreflect on the last time one felt terribly lonely,\nand one can appreciate the seemingly self-\nevident truth of this characterization. But as\nSir Arthur Eddington’s story shows us, the\nobvious and intuitive can sometimes be very\nmisleading. It is now widely recognized that\nmany structures and processes of the mind\noperate outside of awareness, with only the\nend products sometimes reaching awareness.\n\nHumans have evolved to seek\nconnections with and validation from\nother minds, and these social\nconnections represent an important set of\ninvisible forces operating on our brain\nand biology. The need for social\nconnection extends beyond kin relations\nand beyond face to face relations to\ninclude felt connections with\nsuperorganismal entities such as teams,\npolitical parties, nations, and God. The\nunseen forces compelling these\nconnections can be quantified and\ninvestigated objectively independent of\none’s spiritual beliefs. Underlying these\naspirations are selfish genes that have\nproduced a social brain which activates\nreward regions of the brain when we\ncooperate effectively with others (33) or\npunish the perpetrators of social\nexploitations (34), and which activates\nthe pain matrix in the brain when we feel\nrejected by others (35). When people\n\nPage |27\n\nfeel socially isolated (i.e., lonely)\ncompared to when they do not feel\nlonely, they are more likely not only to\nperceive nonhuman objects as human-\nlike but to believe in the existence of\nGod (3/, 36). To understand the full\ncapacity of and forces operating on\nhumans, we need to appreciate not only\nthe memory and computational power of\nthe brain but its capacity for\nrepresenting, understanding, and\nconnecting with other individuals and\nwith the emergent structures, fictional\nand real, that the brain can represent.\nThat is, we need to recognize that we\nhave evolved a powerful, meaning-\nmaking social brain and a need for social\nconnection.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
