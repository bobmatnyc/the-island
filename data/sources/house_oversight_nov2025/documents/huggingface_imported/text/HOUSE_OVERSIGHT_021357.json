Her interests include the social\nshaping of psychological experience, and the\nway that social practice may affect even the most\nconcrete ways in which people experience their\nworld, particularly in the domain of what some\nwould call the “irrational”. Her first project was\na detailed study of the way apparently reasonable\npeople come to believe apparently unreasonable\nbeliefs (“Persuasions of the Witch’s Craft’,\nHarvard, 1989). Her second project explored the\napparently irrational self-criticism of a\npostcolonial India elite, the result of colonial\nidentification with the colonizers (“The Good\nParsi’, Harvard 1996). Her third book identified\ntwo cultures within the American profession of\npsychiatry and examined the way these different\ncultures encouraged two different forms of\nempathy and two different understandings of\nmental illness (“Of Two Minds”, Knopf, 2000).\nShe trained at the University of Cambridge (PhD\n1986), and taught for many years at the\nUniversity of California San Diego. Prior to\nmoving to Stanford she was the Max Palevsky\nProfessor and a director of the Clinical\nEthnography project in the Department of\nComparative Human Development at the\nUniversity of Chicago.\n\nReligion is often understood as a matter\nof belief: a yes/no proposition. This essay\nsuggests that it may be more helpful, and more\naccurate, to understand religious commitment as\na response to sensory experience that can be\nlearned, and that the capacity to learn depends\nupon one’s knowledge and belief, one’s\nproclivity for experiencing the world in\nparticular ways, and the impact of devotional\npractice.\n\nPage |111\n\ninvisible and immaterial, as God is\nwithin the Christian tradition? This is not\nthe question of whether God is real, but\nrather how people learn to make the\njudgment that God is present. Such a\nGod is not accessible to the senses.\nWhen you talk to that God, you can\nneither see his face nor hear his voice.\nYou cannot touch him. How can you be\nconfident that he is there?\n\nAnthropology cannot answer the\nquestion of whether God is real. But the\ntraditional method of the discipline,\nparticipant observation, can use the\nslow, careful method of fieldwork to\nexplore the way that people learn to\nexperience God as present in their lives.\nAnd what the method can teach us is that\nthis often intensely private and personal\nrelationship between a creature and its\ncreator is built through a profoundly\nsocial process.\n\nIn fact, one of anthropology’s\nmost useful contributions to\nunderstanding the experience of God is\nto draw attention to just how much work\nfaith takes, and to the fact that different\nkinds of faith—and different\nunderstandings of God—demand\ndifferent kinds of work. Many who do\nnot believe in God approach the question\nof religious belief as the problem of why\npeople should believe in the existence of\nan invisible, intentional agent in their\nworld. One of the more persuasive\nrecent answers emerges from the\nobservation that many of our cognitive\ntraits evolved to help us survive.\nEvolutionary anthropologists and\npsychologists argue that belief in\ninvisible beings is an accidental\nbyproduct of the way our minds have\nevolved over the millennia. Our quick,\neffortless, automatic intuitions lead us to\n“anthropomorphize,” or to see faces in\nthe clouds, as one scholar puts it. From\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021357",
