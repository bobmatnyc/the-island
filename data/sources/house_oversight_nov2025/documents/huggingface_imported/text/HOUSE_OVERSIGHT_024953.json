  "text": "By Al Bayan newspaper\n\nHow do you foresee the impact of the unified GGC currency on UAE’s economy?\n\nIt will have a positive impact on all GCC countries economies. The currency is a federal issue, and the UAE has\nbeen very enthusiastic about the unified currency and showed interest in hosting the GCC Central Bank.\nBy Al Bayan newspaper\n\nHow do you evaluate the experience of the women whom you empowered to assume\nadministrative and legislative roles in the UAE?\n\nThe experience has been very successful and most of those women have demonstrated remarkable commitment\nand significant competency in performing their duties and fulfilling their responsibilities. They have also\nproven that the UAE woman is completely reliable and worthy of trust in all leadership and non-leadership\npositions.\n\nBy Al Bayan newspaper\n\nWhat was the response of the UAE health authorities following your direct criticism of\ndoctors’ professional competencies and your urging that medical services across the\ncountry be enhanced?\n\nThere has been remarkable progress in quality of health care services, which still fall short of our expectations.\nI totally appreciate that pulling together loose ends to rectify mixed processes accumulated over long years\ntakes time. Yet, efforts are now underway to develop the healthcare sector and work is progressing in the right\ndirection. Competition resulting from the growing presence of private healthcare organizations has reflected\npositively on the overall medical performance in the country. I believe all private=2 Oand public sector doctors\nwill live up to international best practices very soon.\n\nEmirates Business 24/7\n\nThere has been increasing federalism in the handling of the financial needs of the\nEmirates, which has been hailed as a good step forward. How do you see this evolving in\nfuture?\n\nThe UAE follows unified legislative, financial and fiscal systems. Federal authorities, led by the UAE Central\nBank and the Ministry of Finance, assume full responsibility of developing and implementing these systems.\nMeasures adopted by the UAE government in response to the global financial crisis only reflect conditions of\nthe UAE market, which has been around for the last 35 years since the Fiscal Council was first established. The\nUAE government’s swift action to address impacts of the global financial crisis has amazed many people. It is\nimportant to remember that the UAE’s response to previous crises, such as the real-estate crisis of the early\n1980s, has always been carried out at the federal level. The increased federalism that you refer to in your\nquestion is yet another proof that the federation is getting stronger.\n\nEmirates Business 24/7\n\nMany laws including the Federal Companies Law have been under scrutiny for a long\ntime. Do you feel there is a need for faster amendments to federal laws to meet today’s\neconomic and social needs of the country?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024953",
