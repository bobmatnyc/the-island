  "text": "discussion of thermodynamic energy and its conservation in Lectures in Physics\nbegins with the premise that it is a numerical quantity that does not change when\none or many alterations in the system occurs. His heurism for energy and its\nconservation involves the premise that Dennis the Menace has 28 indivisible blocks,\na number which his parents find constant at the end of every day of play. If one day\na count yielded 27, an investigation would reveal that a block could be found\nelsewhere, say under the rug. If at the end of the day, the count was 29, the extra\none had to come from somewhere else, perhaps Dennis’s playmate Bruce. If\nDennis locked some of his blocks in the toy box and threw some into a bathtub of\ndirty water and (1) A block weighed three ounces; (2) The box alone weighed 16\nounces; and (3) Each block raised the water level of 6 inches by one fourth of an\ninch, then this metaphoric energy relation can be expressed:\n\n\\4 (weight of box)-16 ounces (height of water)-six inches\n\n(blocks seen = constant (28)\n\n3 ounces 1/4 inch\nFeynman notes that this representation of an energy relation, computed as a\nnumber of blocks, will always remain the same. If there were no blocks in sight, and\none used this energy conservation relation with blocks as units of energy, we find\nno blocks as such in the expression at all.\n\nThe abstract and formal idea of energy in physics first arose in\nmechanics and was generalized to electrostatics and electrodynamics. If one\nidealizes these systems, eliminating real world factors such as friction, temperature\ngradients, temperature dependence of the properties of materials, viscosity,\nhysteresis and other nonlinear behavior, then the energy conservation law says that\nin an isolated and interacting set of systems, the sum of the energies of the several\nsystems remains constant. If, on the other hand, a system interacts with its\nsurroundings, not isolated and interacting, then the increase in the energy of the\nindex system is equal to the work done on the system by its surrounds. Like pre-\nEnron bookkeeping of corporate cash flow and balancing ones personal checking\naccount, energy, like money, does not disappear; it is only changed in expression.\nAs in the context of currency equivalent value, energy can represent a very general\n\nquantity applicable to a wide array of specific objects and activities.
