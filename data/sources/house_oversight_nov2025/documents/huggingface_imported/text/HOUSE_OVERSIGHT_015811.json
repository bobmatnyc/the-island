  "text": "The Brain 121\n\ncomputer. The sophistication is achieved through reading and writing\nmany numbers in parallel, and chaining the steps together so that if you\nread a particular number it triggers another read/write process, and so\non. I’m glossing over some details such as logical functions but, if you\nknow how a modern computer chip is constructed, my description is\nnot far off. Almost all logic today is implemented in tables to achieve the\nspeeds we expect from modern chips.\n\nAll modern computers are clocked. A small piece of quartz rock\nhas been polished, coated with metal, and wired up to a control circuit in\nthe computer. When you apply voltage to the rock it bends and absorbs\nenergy. When the voltage is taken away it bends back and gives out the\nenergy. This is effectively a pendulum and it can be used to make an\naccurate clock. I used to design these for a living. Every logic gate in a\ncomputer is connected to this clock, and each time the clock ticks the\nlogic gates in a computer compute.\n\nMost modern computers are entirely synchronous. The clock rate\nis set so that the gates in the computer fully recover by the time of the\nnext tick, and every gate is therefore ready in its standard position when\nthe next instruction arrives. The human brain does not have a central\nclock. Each neuron acts independently — firing regardless of whether the\nneurons it is adjacent to are ready or not. It is wrong to think of the brain\nas digital. Each neuron does fire and recover, but it may be triggered again\nbefore it fully recovers. This makes for a chaotic and essentially analogue\noperation. If one neuron fires when a second has only half recovered, then\nit gets half an effect. Ifthe neuron is 80% recovered, an 80% effect. Neuron\nrecovery time is quite long, perhaps as much as 1/1000\" of a second, and\nthey are wired in three dimensions to as many as 10,000 other neurons.\nIt is perfectly possible for a set of neurons to run one ‘program’ when\nthey are rested and a completely different ‘program’ when they are 50%\nrecovered and yet another programs if triggered from different starting\nlocations. I have said ‘program, but arguing a brain runs a ‘prograny is\nmisleading. It is not organized like this.\n\nNeural Networks\n\nA neural network is our best attempt at a computer model for the human\nbrain. Each neuron is represented by an entry ina table. The entry records\nall the connections to it, along with the strength of each connection —\nthese are called ‘weights. In some models the connections can be both\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015811",
