  "text": "Case 1:19-cv-03377-LAP Document 36-4 Filed 07/03/19 Page 6 of 6\n\nwhile I did not know Ms. McCawley before our contact in this case, I have since learned of her\ntremendous devotion to her clients and her admirable motivation to insure that victims of sexual\nabuse receive effective legal representation when attacks on their credibility are made.\n\nConclusion\n55. In light of all these facts, I believe that Mr. Dershowitz’s bar complaint against Mr.\nBoies and Ms. McCawley is frivolous. The foregoing statements are my personal statements and\nare not an institutional position of the University of Utah. I request that this information be\ntreated confidentially by the Florida Bar and not disseminated outside of the Bar (and those\n\ninvolved in this proceeding) in order to avoid any argument that I have somehow defamed\nanyone.\n\nI declare that the foregoing statements are all true the best of my information and belief,\nand I make these statements under penalty of perjury.\n\nSincerely,\n\n~t sei, gq.\n\naN UDaws Bara.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016202",
