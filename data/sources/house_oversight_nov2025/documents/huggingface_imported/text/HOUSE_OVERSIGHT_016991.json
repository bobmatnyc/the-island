  "text": "People worry about the scenario in which Als take over. I think something much more\namusing, in a sense, will happen first. The AI will know what you intend, and it will be\ngood at figuring out how to get there. I tell my car’s GPS I want to go to a particular\ndestination. I don’t know where the heck I am, I just follow my GPS. My children like\nto remind me that once when I had a very early GPS—the kind that told you, “Turn this\nway, turn that way”—we ended up on one of the piers going out into Boston Harbor.\n\nMore to the point is that there will be an AI that knows your history, and knows\nthat when you’re ordering dinner online you'll probably want such-and-such, or when\nyou email this person, you should talk to them about such-and-such. More and more, the\nAls will suggest to us what we should do, and I suspect most of the time people will just\ngo along with that. It’s good advice—better than what you would have figured out for\nyourself,\n\nAs far as the takeover scenario is concerned, you can do terrible things with\ntechnology and you can do good things with technology. Some people will try to do\nterrible things with technology, and some people will try to do good things with\ntechnology. One of the things I like about today’s technology is the equalization it has\nproduced. I used to be proud that I had a better computer than anybody I knew; now we\nall have the same kind of computers. We have the same smartphones, and pretty much\nthe same technology can be used by a decent fraction of the planet’s 7 billion people. It’s\nnot the case that the king’s technology is different from everybody else’s. That’s an\nimportant advance.\n\nThe great frontier five hundred years ago was literacy. Today, it’s doing\nprogramming of some kind. Today’s programming will be obsolete in a not very long\ntime. For example, people no longer learn assembly language, because computers are\nbetter at writing assembly language than humans are, and only a small set of people need\nto know the details of how language gets compiled into assembly language. A lot of\nwhat’s being done by armies of programmers today is similarly mundane. There’s no\ngood reason for humans to be writing Java code or JavaScript code. We want to\nautomate the programming process so that what’s important goes from what the human\nwants done to getting the machine, as automatically as possible, to doit. This will\nincrease that equalization, which is something I’m interested in. In the past, if you\nwanted to write a serious piece of code, or program for something important and real, it\nwas a lot of work. You had to know quite a bit about software engineering, you had to\ninvest months of time in it, you had to hire programmers who knew this or you had to\nlearn it yourself. It was a big investment.\n\nThat’s not true anymore. A one-line piece of code already does something\ninteresting and useful. It allows a vast range of people who couldn’t make computers do\nthings for them, make computers do things for them. Something Id like to see is a lot of\nkids around the world learn the new capabilities of knowledge-based programming and\nthen produce code that’s effectively as sophisticated as what anybody in the top ranks can\nproduce. This is within reach. We’re at the point where anybody can learn to do\nknowledge-based programming, and, more important, learn to think computationally.\nThe actual mechanics of programming are easy now. What’s difficult is imagining things\nin a computational way.\n\n188\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016991",
