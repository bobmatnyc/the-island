  "text": "effort was to identify a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is\neffectively hawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million\nwith each. I knew paltry little about this and so rather found myself\nidentifying with the young women to whom Epstein was explaining the\nbasic math and mechanics—out of my league, but grateful for the lesson.\n\nThe Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and club like,\npart hang out, part secret society. Along with the difficulty in explaining\nwhy, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful have yet beaten a path to\nhis door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf,\nthat everybody, when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.\n\nA week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on\nSunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, TK,\nTK, TK.\n\nEpstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the\npolitics of the middle of East, entertained that evening a delegation from\nQatar, including Sheikh Hamad, the foreign minister. Hamad, indeed, lives\nacross the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the\nsame decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused demeanor, kept\nprodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of\nthat?”\n\nThe Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most\nworried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery\nallegations.\n\nAt 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining\nroom by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in\ntrouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein.\nWeingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a failed\ndefense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland. (Epstein: “You\nactually believe he was getting fucked?” Weingarten: “From minute one.\nI’m not a virgin. But his was the worst I’ve ever seen. It was like an\nassassination. )\n\nAfter a short discussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving\nthe chocolate, made from pistachios grown on the Shakes farm—and\nspeculation about who actually controls ISIS, I am asked to leave the room.\nTwenty minutes later, after what ever business has been transacted or\nparticular confidences, shared I am asked back in.\n\n“Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the\nroom, “do some many people keep coming back here, everything\nconsidered.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022732",
