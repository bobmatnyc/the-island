  "text": "The charges included “IV therapy,” billed at $787 for the adult and $393 for the child, which suggests that the difference in\nthe amount of saline infused, typically less than a liter, could alone account for several hundred dollars.\n\nTricia O’Malley, a spokeswoman for the hospital, would not disclose the price it pays per IV bag or break down the therapy\ncharge, which she called the hospital’s “private pay rate,” or the sticker price charged to people without insurance. She said\n\nshe could not explain why patients covered by Medicaid were billed at all.\n\nEventually the head of the family, an electrician’s helper who speaks little English, complained to HealthFirst, the Medicaid\nH.M.O. It paid $119 to settle the grandmother’s $2, 168 bill, without specifying how much of the payment was for the IV. It\npaid $66.50 to the doctor, who had billed $606.\n\nAt White Plains Hospital, a patient with private insurance from Aetna was charged $91 for one unit of Hospira IV that cost the\nhospital 86 cents, according to a hospital sookeswoman, Eliza O'Neill.\n\nMs. O’Neill defended the markup as “consistent with industry standards.” She said it reflected “not only the cost of the\nsolution but a variety of related services and processes,” like procurement, biomedical handling and storage, apparently not\nincluded in a charge of $127 for administering the IV and $893 for emergency-room services.\n\nThe patient, a financial services professional in her 50s, ended up paying $100 for her visit. “Honestly, | don’t understand the\nsystem at all,” said the woman, who shared the information on the condition that she not be named.\n\nDr. Frost, the anesthesiologist, spent three days in the same hospital and owed only $8, thanks to insurance coverage by\nUnited HealthCare. Still, she was baffled by the charges: $6,844, including $546 for six liters of saline that cost the hospital\n$5.16.\n\n“It’s just absolutely absurd.” she said. “That’s saltwater.”\n\nLast fall, | appealed to the New York State Department of Health for help in mapping the charges for rehydrating patients in\nthe food poisoning episode. Deploying software normally used to detect Medicaid fraud, a team compiled a chart of what\n\nMedicaid and Medicare were billed in six of the cases.\n\nBut the department has yet to release the chart. It is under indefinite review, Bill Schwarz, a department spokesman, said,\n“to ensure confidential information is not compromised.”\n\nBack to top\n\nStates scramble to get health-care law’s insurance marketplaces up and running\nSarah Kliff and Sandhya Somashekhar - Washington Post\n\nWith a key deadline approaching, state officials across the country are scrambling to get the Affordable Care Act’s complex\ncomputer systems up and running, reviewing contingency plans and, in some places, preparing for delays.\n\nOct. 1 is the scheduled launch date for the health-care law’s insurance marketplaces — online sites where uninsured people\nwill be able to shop for coverage, sometimes using a government subsidy to purchase a plan. An estimated 7 million people\nare expected to use these portals to purchase health coverage in 2014.\n\nThe task is unprecedented in its complexity, requiring state and federal data systems to transmit reams of information\nbetween one another. Some officials in charge of setting up the systems say that the tight deadlines have forced them to\ntake shortcuts when it comes to testing and that some of the bells and whistles will not be ready.\n\n“There’s a certain level of panic about how much needs to be accomplished but a general sense that the bare minimum to\nget the system functional will be done,” said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.\n\n“It will by no means be as smooth and as seamless as people expected.”\n\nOregon announced this month that it will delay consumers’ direct access to its marketplace, opening the Web site only to\nbrokers and consumer-assistance agents in order to shield consumers from opening-day glitches.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028634",
