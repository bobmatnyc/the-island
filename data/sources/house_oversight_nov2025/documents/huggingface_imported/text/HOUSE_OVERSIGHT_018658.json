  "text": "I've previously defined aftercare as \"a cool-down period after an S&M encounter, which\noften involves reassurance and a discussion of how things went.\" That's a decent quick\ndefinition, but there's a lot more to it. Bodily violence sometimes creates a mental\nmalleability and vulnerability that can be used in good ways... but also in terrible ways. I\nsee aspects of this in competitive sports, especially the ones that involve fighting and\nhurting other people very directly. (Have you ever seen that phenomenon where two guys\nfight each other and then become Best Friends right afterwards?)\n\nBeing together with an S&M partner during aftercare can be used to free people, to make\nthem feel amazing and establish extraordinary intimacy. But it can hurt people too; it can\nhurt them terribly.\n\nAftercare, like subspace, is one of the most mysterious parts of S&M. Like subspace, a\nlot of S&Mers describe aftercare in nigh-mystical language. One excellent page of\naftercare advice begins by saying:\n\nAftercare is the last act of the SM drama. It is the culmination, the pulling together of all\nloose ends, the finishing touches, the final communion between sharers of the SM ritual,\nthe phase where the participants formally give the fantasy scene a context in everyday\nreality. Its technical purpose is to transition both players from the elevated states created\nina scene [i.e., an S&M encounter] back into normalcy, returning to the motor control\nand awareness they will need to drive home once the scene is over. But as any good SM\npractitioner will tell you, it's much more than that. It is the time after the action when the\nparticipants come together in mutual affirmation that something special was created and\nshared. It is when affection and closeness is offered and sought. It is, at very least, the\nproper time to express thanks to the person who has shared this tiny segment of your life\nwith you. It can be, and often is, the most beautiful part of a scene, and it is part of the\nscene. To skip it altogether is as rude as having dinner at a friend's house and then\nbolting once you've eaten your fill.\n\nAftercare is not always extraordinary, the same way S&M isn't always extraordinary. Not\neveryone wants or needs aftercare, although I've always felt that if you \"don't do\naftercare,” that's something to warn your partner about ahead of time.\n\nI guess from the outside, aftercare often looks like a combination of snuggling and\nchatting and giggling -- sometimes, crying and/or comforting. From the inside, though,\naftercare can feel like... a shot of pure empathy. Blissful connection. Words like\n\"basking\" and \"glowing\" and \"transcending\" come to mind. As someone said to me when\nI was first getting into S&M: \"Very few S&Mers actually enjoy giving or receiving pain.\nWhat they like is where pain gets them.”\n\nThe Practicalities of S&M Intimacy\n\nI believe that S&Mers should try very hard to put boundaries around our S&M\ninteractions; we should work to communicate carefully, and compartmentalize what we\ndo. Consent, and well-communicated boundaries, are the factors that separate S&M from\nabuse. I talked about those boundaries in \"Thinking More Clearly About BDSM versus\nAbuse,” and I also talked about them in \"What Happens After an S&M Encounter 'Gone\nWrong.\" I've written about S&M communication tactics that enable communication and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018658",
