In the US, the housing market\nrecovery continues and the labor market remains on a modest uptrend. This has helped\nimprove the sentiment of US consumers, and consumption remains the most important\ncontributor to US GDP growth. Growth has also begun to pick up in key areas of the\nemerging markets, including China and Brazil. While the Eurozone economy remains weak,\nwe expect Q3 2012 to mark the bottom, and that growth will begin to get \"less bad\" from\nQ4 2012.\nEquities\nEquity markets have been supported by central bank action and the recent improvements\nin economic data. Our preferred markets remain the US and Emerging Markets (EM).\nInvestor funds have started to flow back into EM, as economic data is improving and\ninflation remains under control. Canada and Australia remain our least favored regions\ndue to falling earnings.\nFixed Income\nUS high yield bonds remain supported by strong corporate fundamentals, modest\neconomic growth, and the broad demand for yield-generating assets. Given this, we see\npotential for further spread tightening. Meanwhile, benchmark rates are expected to rise\ngradually on better economic data, while short rates remain ultra-low. While investment\ngrade corporate bond spreads are approximately fair value, we continue to view their\nabsolute yields as attractive.\nCommodities\nWe keep a neutral stance on commodities. Increased global liquidity has pushed prices up\nover the last few months, however, for a more sustained price increase we likely need to\nsee further evidence of an acceleration in global growth.\nForeign Exchange\nWe remain underweight the Japanese yen. The Japanese economy continues to weaken\nagainst its peers, leading to rising pressure for the Bank of Japan to engage in further\nquantitative easing. We have closed our preference for the Canadian dollar following its\nrecent strength, and therefore close our offsetting short CHF position.\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n3\nCross-asset preferences\nC:\\Program Files\\UBS\\Pres\\Templates\\PresPrintOnScreen.pot\nMost preferred\nLeast preferred\nPortfolio weights\nEquities\nFixed income\n• US\n• Western winners from EM\ngrowth\n• High quality dividend yields\n• Event-driven and relative value\nhedge funds\n• Natural gas growth gainers\n• US high yield\n• Global investment grade credit\n• EM corporate bonds\n• Event-driven and relative value\nhedge funds\n• Canada\n• Australia\n• Developed market\ngovernment bonds\nCommodities\n5%\nReal Estate\n5%\nHedge Funds /\nPrivate Equity\n10%\nEquities USA\n10%\nLiquidity\n10%\nHigh Grade\nBonds\n7%\nInv Grade\nCorporates\nBonds\n9%\nHigh Yield\nBonds\n6%\nEmerging\nMarkets Bonds\n3%\nEquities\nEquities Other\nEurope\n23% EmMa Equities\n6%\n6%\nNote: Portfolio weights are for an advisory\nclient with a \"EUR moderate\" profile.

Historically, dividends have made a\nsubstantial contribution to total returns, and we expect this to remain\nthe case in the current environment.\nWestern winners from emerging market growth (sourced from\nexisting equity holdings)\nEmerging economies continue to grow faster than developed\neconomies. With little need to deleverage and repair balance sheets,\nAsian economies are also well positioned to continue to outpace their\nWestern peers in the years ahead. We have identified companies from\na variety of sectors in Europe, the US and Japan which have significant\nexposure to the rapidly growing emerging regions. We believe a\ndiversified portfolio of these companies will reward investors seeking\nto profit from the robust demand growth in emerging economies.\nNatural gas growth gainers (sourced from existing equity\nholdings)\nNatural gas is a relatively clean source of energy, and we think it will\nbenefit from continued substitution for other energy sources over the\nlong term. We have examined the dynamics of the global market and\nthe various components of the gas value chain, and identified the\nareas we see as the most significant beneficiaries currently. These\ninclude producers in Europe and Asia, suppliers of infrastructure,\nservices and related machinery, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)\nin the US, that offer both attractive yields and growth.\nEM corporates: a growing asset class (sourced from global\ngovernment bonds – CIO UW)\nGiven our relatively constructive current view on risk, we regard EM\ncorporate debt as more attractive than EM sovereign debt due to its\nhigher overall yield. Over a 6-month horizon, we expect EM corporate\nbonds to outperform US Treasuries and deliver total returns of close to\n4%.\n� Government bond alternatives (sourced from government bonds –\nCIO UW)\nDeveloped world government bonds offer a comparatively small cushion\nagainst future interest rate hikes and many face increasing credit risk. We\nexpect selected bonds of supranational or national agencies, sub-national\ngovernments, multinational corporates, and covered bonds to outperform\ngovernment bonds. We recommend switching out of government bonds\ninto these alternatives.\n� US high yield corporate bonds (sourced from government bonds –\nCIO UW)\nPositive economic growth, robust corporate earnings and healthy balance\nsheets provide support to US high yield corporate bonds. Current yield\nspreads of 540 basis points still price in a more dire economic outcome\nthan we expect. Historically, US high yield bonds have delivered similar\nreturns as US equities with lower volatility. We continue to believe that\nUS high yield corporate bonds represent a more favorable risk/return\npotential than equities and expect mid single digit returns over the next 6\nmonths. Senior loans are exposed to similar positive fundamentals, and\noffer an attractive, floating rate alternative to US high yield.\n�\n�\nThe place to be in Hedge Funds\nGrowth in most developed markets remains muted. In this environment,\nless directional hedge fund strategies, such as relative value and event\ndriven, should offer above average returns.\nEM currencies: An underappreciated asset class (sourced from\ngovernment bonds – CIO UW)\nThe currencies of emerging countries, collectively as an asset class and\nmeasured using total returns (i.e. including interest received), have the\npotential to contribute positively to the longer-term returns of a welldiversified\nportfolio. We believe that this is especially relevant now that\nthe developed world is settling into an extended period of very low\ninterest rates.\n= New theme\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n6\nGlobal economic outlook – Summary\nKey questions\n• What are the prospects for the global economy in 4Q 2012 and 1Q 2013?\n• What are the risks that the US economic recovery will falter in the near term?\n• When is the European economy likely to emerge from contraction?\n• What is the near-term outlook for the Chinese economy?\nCIO View (Probability: 75%*)\nSluggish expansion\n• Global economic activity has shown signs of improvement over the last month – albeit from a low base. Importantly,\nthe JPM global composite PMI (a survey measuring economic activity) rose significantly to 52.5 in September from 50.9\nin August. The increase was driven by improvements in both manufacturing and service sector activity. Thus, the\nglobal manufacturing PMI rose marginally to 48.9 from 48.1, while the services PMI jumped two index points to 54.\n• Geographically, improvements were concentrated in the emerging markets and the US. Indeed, we think that\ndownside risks in the US have diminished lately and we expect the moderate recovery to continue ahead. Chinese data\nare still mixed, but we think that an improvement in the economic momentum is in the cards in 4Q. In the EMU and\nUK, recent PMI surveys deteriorated but we still expect the EMU to improve gradually in coming quarters. Overall, we\nexpect the moderate improvement in global economic activity to continue ahead. A key driver here is the latest wave\nof ultra-expansionary monetary policy. Downside risks have diminished somewhat in recent months. We expect Greece\nto stay in the euro this year and sign a new memorandum in November. In the US modest fiscal tightening is expected\nwith the Fed mitigating downside growth risks. The risk of an idiosyncratic slowdown in Asia has declined as the latest\nChinese data confirms that the economy has bottomed.\"\n• Global consumer price inflation peaked in summer 2011 and has since fallen gradually. Base effects and rising\ncommodity prices since June may push up the global headline rate of inflation in coming months.\n� Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*)\nReturn to long-term trend\n• The Eurozone crisis abates. Financial market conditions recover, mitigating the drag from fiscal austerity.\n• Growth in Western Europe turns decisively positive by early 2013 and the US economy grows above trend.\n� Negative scenario (Probability: 15%*)\nRecession\n• There are three key downside risks to the global economy: 1) a significant escalation of the Eurozone debt crisis; 2) a\nsharp fiscal contraction in the US, and 3) a sharp deceleration of the Chinese economy. Each of these risks could\nprecipitate a significant downturn of the global economy.\nKey dates\nTBA\nTroika report on Greece\n2 Nov Nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rate for October\n6 Nov US presidential and congressional elections\n8 Nov The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China\n22–23 Nov European Council\nC:\\Program Files\\UBS\\Pres\\Templates\\PresPrintOnScreen.pot\nGlobal growth expected to be around 3% in\n2012 and 2013\nReal GDP growth in % Inflation in %\n2011 2012F 2013F 2011 2012F 2013F\nAmericas US 1.8 2.1 2.3 3.1 2.1 1.7\nCanada 2.4 2.0 2.3 2.9 2.0 2.3\nBrazil 2.7 1.5 4.5 6.5 5.4 6.5\nAsia/Pacific Japan -0.8 2.3 2.0 -0.3 0.0 0.3\nAustralia 2.1 3.7 3.2 3.4 1.7 2.5\nChina 9.3 7.5 7.8 5.4 2.8 3.6\nIndia 6.5 5.5 6.5 8.0 7.5 7.0\nEurope Eurozone 1.5 -0.4 0.2 2.7 2.4 1.9\nGermany 3.1 0.9 1.1 2.5 1.7 1.5\nFrance 1.7 0.2 0.4 2.1 2.0 1.3\nItaly 0.5 -2.4 -0.2 2.9 3.3 2.7\nSpain 0.4 -1.6 -1.7 3.1 2.4 2.7\nUK 0.9 -0.3 1.0 4.5 2.7 2.3\nSwitzerland 1.9 1.1 1.4 0.2 -0.5 1.2\nRussia 4.3 3.8 3.7 8.5 5.1 6.8\nWorld 3.2 2.7 3.1 3.9 2.9 3.0\nSource: UBS CIO, as of 24 October 2012\nIn developing the CIO economic forecasts, CIO economists\nworked in collaboration with economists employed by UBS\nInvestment Research.

We expect flattish growth in 4Q 2012 and 1Q 2013 (in line with\nconsensus). Beyond this, uncertainties regarding the debt crisis and continuing fiscal austerity efforts will likely keep\nthe pace of recovery subdued. The ECB is still in easing mode but after announcing a conditional bond purchasing\nprogram, it would take a marked worsening of the debt crisis and/or a worsening of economic data to trigger any\nfurther policy action.\n• There is political pressure on Spain to apply for official financial support (OMT by the ECB and direct support from\nthe EFSF/ESM). However, the government may hesitate until market pressure rises and/or clear political benefits are on\noffer. We think that Italy will have to apply for an aid package similar to Spain’s. We see a high probability of Spain\nbeing downgraded to junk by at least one rating agency.\n• OMT bond purchases in the secondary market will focus on maturities of up to three years and countries will be\nexpected to maintain their funding profiles by also issuing longer-dated bonds. Hence, longer yields should stay\nelevated as bondholders remain concerned about countries' ability and willingness to implement necessary reforms,\nand about the de-facto subordination to ECB holdings and official loans. The central banking supervision at the ECB is\nunlikely to be ready by January 2013, meaning that direct bank recapitalization through the ESM remains unavailable.\n• We think Greece will not exit the euro in 2012 but will sign a new memorandum by November, although further\ndelay is possible. We think that Greece's failure to meet targets may trigger a cut-off from funding by early 2013 and\na possible gradual exit later. Portugal and Ireland should remain on track with their bailout packages, Cyprus will\nlikely get a new package and Slovenia may ask for help soon.\n� Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*)\nReturn to macro stability\n• Bond yields are contained as peripheral countries' budgets stay on track and economic activity recovers faster than\nexpected. Greece complies with the new austerity plans and market confidence is restored.\n� Negative scenario (Probability: 15%*)\nMajor shock\n• Major shocks include Spain and Italy being fully cut off from bond markets, i.e. requiring all new funding through\nEFSF/ESM/IMF loans, with European rescue funds only able to cover them until the end of 2013; resistance from core\ncountries against the ECB program and further support; a Portuguese default; a Greek euro exit before the end of\n2012; or a major external shock.\nKey dates\nTBD\nTroika report on Greece\n8 Nov ECB press conference\n12 Nov Eurogroup meeting\n15 Nov Eurozone GDP 3Q: first estimate\n22 Nov Eurozone composite purchasing managers index\n22–23 Nov European Council\nPurchasing managers indices point to\nongoing contraction in 3Q\n65\n60\n55\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS, as of October 2012\nYield of Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds\nover German Bunds (in bps)\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n07 08 09 10 11 12\nManufacturing Services\nComposite No-change line\n0\n03/2011 06/2011 09/2011 12/2011 03/2012 06/2012 09/2012\nItaly\nSpain\nSource: UBS, Bloomberg, as of 16 October 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n* Scenario probabilities are based on qualitative assessment.\nFor further information please contact CIO analyst Thomas Wacker, thomas.wacker@ubs.com and\nCIO economist Ricardo Garcia, ricardo-za.garcia@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n8\nKey financial market driver 2 –\nUS economic outlook\nC:\\Program Files\\UBS\\Pres\\Templates\\PresPrintOnScreen.pot\nKey questions\n• Is the nascent growth recovery sustainable? Will the Fed stimulus boost growth?\n• How will the election result change fiscal policy deliberations?\n• Can politicians find an agreement to avoid a sharp fiscal contraction in early 2013 (i.e. the \"fiscal cliff\")?\nCIO View (Probability: 70%*)\nModerate expansion\n• The economy stays on a moderate growth path but the unemployment rate comes down only very gradually – the\nSeptember report exaggerated the pace of improvement. Core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation stays\nslightly below or close to the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. UBS forecasts real GDP growth of 2.0% in 3Q 2012\n(consensus: 1.8%) and 1.6% in 4Q 2012 (consensus: 1.9%). The Fed has added considerable stimulus: it extended\nOperation Twist and its interest rate forward guidance, indicated that it will stay highly accommodative even after the\nrecovery strengthens, launched an open-ended agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchase program of USD\n40bn per month, and shows a strong easing bias tied to the state of the labor market. The Fed actions effectively\nmitigate downside growth risks, but they are unlikely to dramatically boost growth.\n• In the elections, Republicans will likely lose seats in the House on a net basis but retain a majority; we expect them\nto be even with Democrats in the Senate. Obama will likely retain the White House. Such an electoral outcome would\nprolong the existing gridlock between Republicans and Democrats.\n• Due to the ongoing political gridlock, we expect modest fiscal tightening. The government will likely let\nunemployment benefits phase out and payroll tax cuts expire, but postpone income tax hikes and sequester spending\ncuts. Such a decision would lower the federal deficit by 0.7% of GDP, with a likely lower real GDP growth impact as\nhouseholds could buffer the income loss with lower savings.\n� Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*)\nStrong expansion\n• Propelled by expansive monetary policy and a fading Eurozone crisis, growth accelerates persistently above 3.0%.\nThis leads to higher inflation and the Fed responds by halting QE3 and raising rates sooner.\n• The better economic outlook raises the odds of an Obama reelection and makes it harder for Republicans to gain\nseats in Congress. Faster-rising tax collection and a Democratic stronghold leads to some tax hikes and limited\nspending cuts. Fiscal policy tightens by about 1.2% of GDP in 2013.\n� Negative scenario (Probability: 20%*)\nGrowth recession\n• US fiscal deleveraging and an escalating Eurozone crisis weigh on the cyclical recovery. Falling profit margins weigh\non business capital expenditures. Real GDP growth deteriorates much further. The Fed massively purchases agency\nMBS and Treasuries under its QE3 program.\n• The debt limit is reached earlier and the Treasury runs out of money before year-end. Political gridlock becomes\ndysfunctional, thus sending the country over the \"fiscal cliff,\" with fiscal policy tightening by\nUSD 607 billion (3.7% of UBS estimate of 2013 GDP) in 2013.

Inventory reductions\nshould be less of a drag on growth and the government is rolling out more investment plans. At the same time,\npolitical uncertainty should diminish after the power handover in November. We think that real GDP will grow 7% y/y\nin 4Q (consensus: 7.7%) before improving mildly to 7.3% in 1Q 2013 (consensus: 7.9%).\n• Indicators measuring inventory levels have fallen recently, showing that the destocking cycle is well advanced. In\naddition, domestic prices for some major raw materials appear to have bottomed out, which should support a mild\nrebound in production activity in the coming months. However, this may not be sustainable without a genuine\nrecovery in final demand.\n• While the government has recently announced trillions of infrastructure investment projects, the spending will span\nseveral years and the source of funding remains unclear. In addition, real estate investment growth is likely to stabilize\nbut not rebound strongly in the months ahead. We therefore do not expect a sharp rise in investment growth. Fiscal\nsupport measures should help to stabilize economic growth, but are unlikely to result in a strong growth boost.\n• The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be held on 8 November, which is exactly the same\ndate as in the previous leadership handover in 2002. With the transition of the senior Communist Party leadership\ntaking place in this meeting, political uncertainties should be reduced. Execution of policy easing measures could\nimprove, although a substantial new stimulus is unlikely in the near term. In terms of monetary policy, we do not\nexpect any interest rate cut for the rest of the year, but a reserve requirement cut is still possible to manage liquidity.\nSource: CEIC, Wind, UBS, as of 15 October 2012\nInvestment staying supportive to growth\n� Positive scenario (Probability: 20%*)\nHigher-than-expected growth\n• Chinese GDP grows above 7.7% in 2012. This would require more effective fiscal and monetary policy support from\nthe government and possibly also a fast improvement in the Eurozone debt crisis.\n� Negative scenario (Probability: 10%*)\nHard landing\n• Chinese GDP grows below 6%, i.e. a hard landing of the economy. This could be triggered by a global financial\ncrisis/recession, causing a slump in Chinese exports, or domestic policy staying adrift during the leadership transition\nperiod. Other risks include a sharp movement in residential property prices, or a surge in inflation that forces the PBoC\nto significantly tighten monetary policy.\nKey dates\n1 Nov Manufacturing purchasing managers index (October)\n8 Nov The 18 th National Congress of the Communist Party of China\n9 Nov Consumer price inflation, industrial production, fixed-asset investment (October)\n10-15 Nov New bank lending, M2 (October) Source: Bloomberg, UBS, as of 15 October 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n* Scenario probabilities are based on qualitative assessment.\n10\nFor further information please contact CIO analyst Gary Tsang, gary.tsang@ubs.com, Glenda Yu, glenda.yu@ubs.com, Patrick Ho, patrick-ww.ho@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nSection 2\nAsset class views\nSection 2.A\nAsset class views\nEquities\nEquities overview\nC:\\Program Files\\UBS\\Pres\\Templates\\PresPrintOnScreen.pot\nGlobal equity markets – Key points\n• We keep an overall neutral allocation to equities (see summary on slide 3).\n• We keep our preference for US equities. Resilient company earnings still speak for an overweight\nstance. Continued economic growth should underpin earnings also in 2013.\n• We keep our neutral stance on Eurozone equities. Value is attractive compared to global equities.\nHowever, due to the recession in several countries the earnings dynamics remains weak. In addition,\nuncertainty as to when and under what conditions Spain will sign a memorandum of understanding keeps\nus from taking a more positive stance.\n• We have an overweight position in EM equities. Monetary easing as well as fiscal stimulus in key\ncountries, coupled with relatively attractive valuations, are supporting factors. Economic activity is likely to\nimprove gradually over the coming quarters, supporting company earnings.\n• We keep our negative stance on Canadian equities. Corporate earnings continue to decline, showing\na weak development relative to the global trend. In addition, valuation is not compelling.\n• We are cautious on Australian equities. Realized earnings continue to come down for the market.\n• We are neutral on Swiss equities. Companies show solid earnings growth, which is expected to hold up\nbetter than in other regions. Although the Swiss franc is still overvalued, the weakening to the USD and\nrelated currencies since this summer provides additional earnings support.\n• We keep our neutral view on UK equities. In the UK the earnings dynamics lags behind other markets.\nAlso, the recent strengthening in the pound is a drag for earnings measured in local currency terms.\nPreferences (6 months)\nNorth\nAmerica\nEurope\nAPAC\nEM\nunderweight\nEquities\ntotal\nUSA\nCanada\nEMU\nUK\nSwitzerland\nSweden\nAustralia\nHong Kong\nJapan\nSingapore\nGlobal EM\nneutral\nnew old\nNote: Preference in hedged terms (excl. currencies)\noverweight\nGlobal equity sectors – Key points\n• We keep our overweight in Consumer Staples. Among the defensives it offers good earnings growth\nprospects due to its geographically diversified revenue generation.\n• We reiterate our preference for global IT due to a superior growth outlook and as we are in the\nseasonally strong second half year. With healthy balance sheets and good cash flows, sector valuation is in\nline with the overall market, while we believe it deserves a larger premium.\n• We continue to like Healthcare as it offers solid long-term earnings prospects with low volatility and\nstrong balance sheets. We reiterate our underweight in Telecoms, where we expect ongoing weak\nrevenue growth as well as margin pressure.\n• We are negative on Consumer Discretionary as earnings expectations may be too optimistic. With\nleading indicators in major regions still deteriorating, we keep our underweight in Industrials. We have\nconcerns over weak manufacturing momentum leading to increased earnings revisions.\n• The earnings outlook for US and Asian Financials is solid. We are neutral globally on Financials.

Earnings continued\nto hold up better than in other regions during the recent economic slowdown. Continued economic\ngrowth should allow companies to show mid single digit earnings growth over the coming 12 months.\n• The US central bank's (Fed) very pro-growth oriented policy stance is a clear advantage for the local\nequity market; the recent introduction of additional quantitative easing (QE 3) is positive for riskier assets.\n• We still expect some potential for re-rating over the coming 6 months, in terms of increases in the priceto-earnings\nratio (P/E).\n• The debate around the fiscal cliff implies increased uncertainty over the coming months.

While the sovereign debt crisis remains a risk factor\n(see slide 8), the conditional bond buying program by the ECB (OMT) and the introduction of the ESM have\nsignificantly reduced downside risks.\n• Near-term we might see volatility increasing as politicians wrangle about the steps needed to provide a\nmore lasting solution to the debt crisis (setup of a single banking regulator, solving the banking related\nproblems in Spain, etc. ). We think that attractive valuations sufficiently compensate for those risks.\n• The weak economic environment with recessions in the southern countries continues to weigh on\ncorporate earnings.

Commodity related sectors show steep earnings declines,\nwhich is expected to moderate only in a lagged fashion to stabilizing commodity prices. The Healthcare\nsector suffers from company specific issues which affect earnings also negatively.\n• With the oil price expected to trade down over the next 3 months, earnings of companies in the energy\nsector - comprising about 20% of the market – should remain depressed over the coming quarters. Within\nfinancials, law suits related to mis-selling of insurance related products represent a special risk factor.\n• Recent strengthening of the British pound is also a headwind for the competitiveness of UK companies,\nas earnings measured in the local currency are negatively affected.\n• The PE of UK equities looks attractive at first sight.

Swiss companies are internationally well\ndiversified, with about 2/3 of revenues generated in the US and in emerging markets. This provides the\nbasis for solid revenue and earnings, despite economic weakness in Europe.\n• Swiss companies are trying to mitigate concerns about global economic prospects and a strong Swiss\nfranc using tight cost controls. This should protect operating margins.\n• While the Swiss franc remains overvalued, the currency is not longer a drag. In fact, after depreciating\nsince summer versus the USD and related currencies, Swiss companies' earnings will show positive currency\ntranslation and margin effects.\n• Especially in an environment of low economic growth we like the properties of decent earnings growth,\nsolid balance sheets and a reasonable valuation.\n� Positive scenario SMI (6-month target): 7,500\n• Eurozone economic growth is reaccelerating considerably, providing further relief to Swiss financials as\nwell as Swiss exporters. Defensive sectors would likely be left behind in a strong global relief rally.

A relatively high growth rate\nstill reflects last year's sharp decline caused by two natural disasters. Still, the earnings recovery has\ndisappointed so far. Earnings growth continues to slow down and is expected to move toward a more\nnormal single-digit growth in 2013.\n• The government started implementing its JPY 18 trillion recovery budget in Q4 2011; we expect it to\nboost GDP by 0.5-1.0% in FY2012, and about 0.5% in 2013.\n• However, we see only limited scope for an additional earnings boost from the local economic recovery.\nSlowing export markets also curtail the outlook. June quarter-earnings results revealed emerging market\ndemand was below expectation, capping earnings growth.\n• We expect the TOPIX trailing P/E to drop to around 13.5x from 15.0x over the coming months, mainly due\nto the earnings recovery; this provides room for moderate price increases only.\n� Positive scenario Topix (6-month target): 970\n• Stronger global demand and stabilizing European markets lead to improved risk-taking. Falling risk\naversion is likely to lead to a weaker yen, providing an additional increase in earnings.

One implication of these low\ninterest rate policies, we believe, will be to enhance emerging market (EM) equity returns in USD by\nsupporting EM currencies more broadly against the USD over the next six months.\n• In our base case, we see the P/E multiple of the MSCI EM Index staying around the current level of 11x\ntrailing (i.e. realized) earnings over the next six months. Over the next 12 months, we expect EM earnings\ngrowth of around 11% (slightly below consensus).\n• Over the past month, structural reforms that will have longer-term benefits were announced in India\n(retail sector), Russia (energy sector) and Mexico (labor market). This highlights that the emerging\neconomies have options to improve the competitiveness of their economies, if they choose to do so.\n� Positive scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 1,325\n• The outlook for the global economy improves, boosting EM's ability to grow more strongly in 2013. This\nstronger economic growth leads to earnings growth of 15%. Investor confidence improves, leading to a\nbetter P/E multiple of 14x trailing earnings. If oil prices rose too, Russia would benefit in this scenario.\n� Negative scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 800\n• A significant escalation in the Eurozone, a sharp fiscal contraction in the US, and a rapid deceleration in\nChinese growth could each hit EM's economic prospects. In such a scenario, we would expect a 20% decline\nin earnings over six months. More defensive Malaysia would do better, whereas more cyclical South Korea\nand Russia would underperform.

US economic\ndata is forecast to stabilize and then show moderate economic growth in the second half of 2012 and into\n2013. The greater domestic sales exposure of US mid caps reduces the earnings risk coming from Europe.\n• In Europe, we prefer companies with a large market capitalization (large caps) over ones with a small one\n(small caps) in the current very challenging economic environment. Small caps generate more sales in\nContinental Europe than large caps. Thus, they are more negatively affected by weak domestic demand.\nSmall caps also have a more cyclical earnings exposure than large caps.\n• Globally, high-quality dividend paying stocks promise to provide a real and stable income stream to\ninvestors in the current low-yield environment. Furthermore, they give exposure to the long-term potential\nof equity markets while tending to suffer less in declining markets.\n� Positive scenario\nPrefer value, low quality and small caps\n• Leading indicators continue to move higher, and risks related to the Eurozone debt crisis subside. In this\ncase, add deep cyclical value (cheap price/book, price/earnings) regardless of the sector, with high beta and\nhigh leverage. In such an environment, small and mid-cap stocks should also perform well. A dividend\nstrategy would be too defensive to outperform the market.\n� Negative scenario\nPrefer quality and large caps\n• The global economic picture deteriorates markedly. In this case, buy high-quality growth companies and\nlarge caps. Do not look for value opportunities, but be as defensive as possible with your equity exposure.\nLook to high-quality, dividend-paying stocks for yield.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).\nRegional differentiation\n• In the US, we prefer mid caps to large\ncaps.

This is likely to have a slightly negative effect on most developed\ngovernment bond prices, and is likely to result in a total return around zero over this period.\n• Price fluctuations in the month ahead could originate from developments in the Eurozone and the US.\nThey include the Troika report on Greece, Spanish local elections/referendum and the possible delayed\nrequest for additional ECB support in Europe. In the US, the extent of the fiscal cliff is dependent on the\nelection outcome and the results from the debates in the subsequent lame duck session of congress.\nWhile we expect the full cliff to be avoided, it poses a significant downside risk to domestic growth.\n• Overall, we suggest keeping the duration close to neutral, as we expect global growth to remain\nlackluster and central banks to continue supporting bond markets.\nPreferences (6 months)\nshort duration neutral\nUSD\nEUR (DE)\nGBP\nJPY\nCHF\nCAD\nlong duration\nCorporate and emerging market bonds – Key points\n• We maintain a preference for investment-grade (IG) and US high-yield (HY) corporate credit. A strong\n(US) corporate sector, the ongoing moderate recovery of the US economy, determined central bank\nsupport and a strong technical backdrop are likely to further support credit segments.\n• Investment-grade corporate bonds have achieved a total return of more than 10% so far this year, at\nremarkably low volatility. While absolute returns will likely be moderate in the next six months (1-2%),\nthe asset class should continue outperforming government bonds, offering higher liquidity than HY\nbonds. We see the highest return potential in the lower-rated IG segments (BBB and A).\n• US corporate bonds of lower credit quality (HY) remain fundamentally supported by solid balance\nsheets and a benign US growth outlook. Given the low risk of default losses, valuations are attractive at\nan effective yield of above 6%.

Improving domestic economic and sentiment data\nwas balanced by concerns of the elections/fiscal cliff weighing on the US economy. However, both the ECB and the\nFed have provided substantial and credible backstops that significantly reduce tail risks. This reduces the flight to\nquality and the risk discount placed on Treasuries in the event of a re-escalation of the European debt crisis. This\nrepresents a clear floor with little chance of retesting the historical lows of July (~1.4%). In addition, the Fed's\nwillingness to fall behind the curve in support of the domestic labor market will increase inflation expectations over\nthe medium term. This implies steeper yield curves.\n• In addition, the credible and conditional central bank backstops have already improved sentiment and should help\nto kick-start growth if politicians provide the necessary tailwinds. Yields will then return to their slightly higher,\npreviously stable ranges over a six-month horizon (1.8%-2.1%).\n• At the same time, US yields should be capped, as the US economy continues to be vulnerable to spillover effects\nfrom the Eurozone. Structurally weak growth which will be dampened by the upcoming US fiscal consolidation, will\nadd to volatility and limit the increase in yields.\n� Positive scenario for US bonds US 10-year (6-month range): 1.4–1.6%\n• US fiscal deleveraging beyond our expectations weighs on the cyclical recovery and is a drag on yields.\n• A re-escalation of the European debt crisis burdens yields.

Markets still await\ncrucial developments in Spain, Greece and the extent of the US fiscal cliff, and have not fully reflected\nmixed but stabilizing fundamentals. However, when compared to the all-time lows witnessed in August\n(~1.2%), yields are still trading at decisively higher levels. This is supported by the ECB announcement to\nact as a lender of last resort by intervening in the secondary markets with unlimited and conditional\ngovernment bonds purchases. In addition, the open-ended Fed stimulus hinging on the labor market\ncontributed to improving sentiment. This provides a cap for short-term peripheral yields and a floor for\nBund yields.\n• Over a six-month horizon, we expect yields to trend slightly higher, returning to previously higher ranges.\nThe central bank backstops have already improved confidence and resulted in convergence between the\nperiphery and the core. This speaks for slightly better growth prospects and thus slightly higher yields.\n• However, growth is still structurally weak, and short-term uncertainties (US elections, fiscal cliff, Spain)\nremain. Consequently, short-term downside risks persist around year end. The ECB, however, will limit the\nspread from widening, providing a bottom to Bund yields as well.\n• In the UK, economic data stabilized and we expect the BoE to extend quantitative easing in November.\n• In Switzerland, yields rose only slightly owing to mixed economic data. The Swiss National Bank stands\nready to act. With much negative news priced in, we believe Swiss yields will gradually start to normalize.\n� Positive scenario for German bonds 10-year Bund yield (6-month range): 1.2–1.5%\n• Implementation risks in the ECB framework remain, in particular the need for Italy and Spain to apply for\naid. At the same time, Greece may announce a second debt restructuring and is likely to leave the\nEurozone in 2013.\n• US fiscal deleveraging beyond our expectations weighs on the cyclical recovery and is a drag on yields.\n• Further non-standard policy measures by the Fed are supportive for Bunds and speak for lower yields.\n� Negative scenario for German bonds 10-year Bund yield (6-month range): 1.8–2.3%\n• A moderate Eurozone economic recovery kicks in. Spain and Italy are ahead on their austerity\ncommitments without needing ECB support.

Still, IG bonds will likely continue to\noutperform government bonds, offering low volatility and stable income.\n• We lower our spread target from 170bps to 140bps due to the improved global macro and risk\nenvironment after recent central bank action and the pickup in economic data. IG bonds remain\nsupported by our outlook for sluggish but positive global growth, ongoing investor appetite for incomegenerating\nassets, and expected negative net issuance.\n• Non-financial corporates: While total yields are at record lows, the pickup over government bonds and\nmoney market rates is still attractive. Aggressive re-leveraging by companies looks unlikely.\n• Financial corporates: Due to regulatory challenges, spreads are expected to remain above past averages.\nUS banks are in a more favorable position than their European peers as they are better capitalized and\nearnings have been strong recently. US financial spreads are thus likely to tighten further.\n� Positive scenario\nSpread target (6-month): 130bps\n• Global growth accelerates more forcefully than expected. This could compress spreads closer to pre-crisis\nlevels. Spreads for Financials are likely to remain elevated due to regulatory challenges. However, in this\ncase, rising benchmark yields would likely lead to slightly negative IG returns over six months.\n� Negative scenario\nSpread target (6-month): 380bps\n• Main risks include a sharp slowdown of the US economy (e.g. the \"fiscal cliff\"). Also, risks in the\nEurozone persist (e.g. Greek exit, Spain/Italy getting cut off from private funding).

In\nparticular, the Fed's buying of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) is likely to provide further support for the\ncredit universe.\n• Thus, US high yield (HY) bonds continue to offer attractive value although spreads tightened\nconsiderably in Q3. We think the recent rally has been justified in light of the favorable default outlook\nand central bank action. The ongoing slow recovery of the US economy, healthy company balance sheets,\nrobust earnings, and strong investor appetite for yield assets continue to push spreads lower. US HY thus\nremains our preferred asset class.\n• Despite the recent uptick in defaults, in the absence of a renewed US recession, we expect the default\nrate to remain stable at 3.5% until the end of the year. A heavy load of new issuance so far this year means\nthat HY companies will be faced with a lower risk of failed refinancing going forward (e.g. in case of an\nunexpected economic slump).\n� Positive scenario\nUSD HY spread target (6-month): 400bps\n• Even in the positive economic scenario, spreads are unlikely to tighten to pre-crisis lows of below 300bps\ndue to lower liquidity and a generally higher risk premium after the financial crisis. Benchmark yields\nwould rise, limiting HY returns to around 7%. European HY outperforms the US.\n� Negative scenario\nUSD HY spread target (6-month): 1,000bps\n• A global recession is the major risk for high yield bonds. Based on the robust state of the corporate\nsector, we would not expect spreads to surpass \"usual\" recession levels around 1,000bps. Although shortterm\nspikes are possible due to liquidity suddenly drying up, we expect a quick normalization.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nRecommendations\nTactical (6 months)\n• US high yield corporate bonds offer an\nattractive return outlook and should be\noverweighted.\n• We prefer US over European issuers given\nthe increasing proportion of peripheral\nand financial issuers in the European HY\nuniverse and the poorer economic outlook\nin Europe.\n• Inflows into HY mutual funds have been\nstrong so far in 2012.

We think valuations\nof EM corporate bonds are more attractive than valuations of EM sovereign bonds. Additionally, the\ngradual recovery in EM we expect over coming quarters should support the performance of EM corporate\nbonds relative to EM sovereign bonds. Corporate bonds tend to outperform sovereign bonds during\nperiods of accelerating growth.\n• However, absolute returns of EM bonds will be lower than in the past, we think, as the room for spreads\nto tighten further has become more limited. We expect total returns of less than 2% for EM sovereigns\nand close to 4% for EM corporate bonds over the next six months.\n• Negative headlines from the Eurozone or global growth fears might put renewed short-term pressure on\nEM bond prices. We think that periods of price weakness offer attractive entry points.\n� Positive scenario\nEMBI Global/CEMBI spread target (6-month): 235bps/230bps\n• Yield stability in Europe's core markets and higher-than-expected growth in the US would provide a\nfavorable backdrop for EM fixed-income spreads.

Given that the ECB action was EUR-positive and\nthe Fed action USD-negative, EURUSD has jumped considerably, but since then moved little.\n• We believe the risks to the pair are now more balanced, and see a range between EURUSD 1.28–1.35 for\nthe months ahead. A Spanish ESM/OMT request would be EUR positive. While the US elections and US\nfiscal cliff could lead to short term USD strength, we see the USD weaker over the next 6 months.\n• The CAD remains supported by better growth dynamics in Canada and QE in the US. However, we believe\nthe recent appreciation against the USD could see a near-term setback and we close the overweight.\n• We keep the overweight position in the GBP despite the current asset purchasing program by the Bank of\nEngland (BoE), which we believe will be terminated in November. The GBP remains well supported given\nthe recent rebound in economic data, the expectation of a stronger economy in 2013 and because\ninvestors are seeking liquid alternatives to the EUR, the USD and the JPY.\n• EURCHF has traded higher in our 1.20–1.23 range recently and we continue to see the pair in that range.\nThe SNB protects the downside, while a strong upside move is also limited by a potential flare-up in the\neuro crisis and reserve unwinding of the SNB at some point. Given this balance, we have decided to close\nthe underweight in the CHF.\n• Sweden and Norway stand out for their lower debt-to-GDP ratios and current account surpluses. Both the\nSEK and NOK have appreciated on diversification and safe-haven inflows, but economic data in both\ncountries has become weaker recently, which led to a setback in the SEK. A rate cut in Sweden cannot be\nruled out, but seems to be priced in already.\n• Longer-term debt issues and weak competitiveness of major exporters are hurting the Japanese economy\nand PMIs have disappointed. We therefore think the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance will maintain\nan expansive policy bias and continue trying to weaken the JPY. We are underweight JPY.\n• For commodity currencies, the AUD and NZD continue to trade at the top of their well established\nranges. We got the expected rate cut in Australia and expect another cut by year end. Do not buy AUD\nabove AUDUSD 1.00. We have a preference for the NZD over the AUD.\n• We maintain a positive medium-term view on emerging market (EM) currencies. This is supported by\nhigher short-term rates which provide an attractive yield pick-up relative to developed market currencies\nas monetary policies are expected to remain loose for longer. We think investors should increase EM FX\nexposure across regions. Lower tail risks in Europe should be especially supportive of the higher-yielding\ncurrencies in EMEA and Latin America.\n• Our most preferred emerging market currencies are currently the MXN, ZAR, PLN, KRW and SGD.We\nexpect the CNY to appreciate 2% against the USD, moving towards 6.20 over the coming 12 months.\nInternationally marketable instruments (such as CNH, the offshore version of the Chinese currency traded\nin Hong Kong) have similar appreciation potential.\nPreferences (6 months)\nunderweight\nneutral\nUSD\nEUR\nGBP\nJPY\nCHF\nSEK\nNOK\nCAD\nNZD\nAUD\nnew old\nSource: UBS CIO WM Global Investment Office\noverweight\n30\nFor further information please contact CIO asset class specialist Thomas Flury, thomas.flury@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nG10 currencies\nC:\\Program Files\\UBS\\Pres\\Templates\\PresPrintOnScreen.pot\nUBS View\nSee table for current exchange rates and CIO forecasts\n• We believe the risks to the EURUSD currency pair are now more balanced, as tail risks on the European\nside have been considerably reduced.\n• The GBP trended higher despite stimulus measures by the Bank of England. The main reason is the need\nfor diversification out of the EUR and USD and decisive UK policy making. We maintain an overweight\nafter the strong rebound of economic data in 3Q 2012 which we expect to persist into 2013.\n•The CAD remains supported by better growth dynamics. However in the short term, around the US\nelections and fiscal cliff debate, a setback cannot be ruled out. We also remain underweight in the AUD.\n• The SNB has shown that it can defend the CHF floor. With EUR tail risk reduced the CHF likely recovers\ntogether with the EUR against most other currencies. Thus we close the CHF underweight.\n• We expect stronger policy intervention in Japan to weaken the JPY over the coming months.\n� Positive scenario FX targets: EURUSD >1.35 / EURJPY 115\n• The announcement of unlimited QE in the US, as well as a stronger-than-expected acceleration of global\ngrowth or further European integration would be EURUSD positive. EURUSD should trade above 1.35 in\nthis case. Yen weakness should come as the Bank of Japan intervenes to weakens its currency.\n� Negative scenario FX targets: EURUSD <1.25 / EURJPY 90\n• The European growth outlook deteriorates further with continued recession in 2013. The euro could\nrapidly fall below 1.25. A European debt-default cascade (possibly triggered by a disorderly Greece euro\nexit) is a tail risk for the single currency. Risk aversion would lead to an extended USD and JPY rally.\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nChinese growth\nEuropean sovereign\ncrisis, ECB policy\nUS growth and Fed\npolicy response\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nWe expect China to land softly and then recover. Should China disappoint with a\nhard landing, then risk-unwinding would support USD and JPY vs. risk-taker\ncurrencies. In the base case, a Chinese recovery should support the AUD in the\nmedium term, but a dip below parity is likely in the short term.\nThe main focus lies on the Spanish application for ESM/ECB support, which would\nbe EUR positive; a rate cut (not expected) would hurt the EUR.

We think monetary\npolicies of major central banks will remain loose for longer whereas the easing cycle in several emerging\nmarkets is over.

Long\nterm investors should therefore diversify into EM currencies using surplus exposure to these currencies.\n• In Europe, both the Polish zloty (PLN) and the Turkish lira (TRY) have supportive fundamentals in the\nlong-term and could benefit from inflows into their fixed-income market which offers attractive yield\nrelative to G4 currencies.

Investors\nhave started to reflect on the underlying economic challenges that motivated the easing decisions by\nkey central banks. With global economic growth barely accelerating, the asset class will struggle to\nappreciate firmly over the coming months. We therefore advise investors to have only low single digit\nreturn expectations for commodities warranting a neutral stance.\n• Gold is less depending on economic growth, however the metal could be a beneficiary of ample\nliquidity provided by central banks. But ebbing QE news flow at a later stage (6-12 months) might\nchallenge the necessary investment demand inflows to balance the market. Hence, we stay neutral\non precious metals.\n• The return outlook of the energy sector remains not compelling in 4Q12 and we stay neutral. Global\ncrude oil supply should expand firmly and surpass incremental demand in 4Q12. We think this will bring\nBrent crude oil prices temporarily towards USD 95/bbl while WTI should slide towards USD 78/bbl in\n4Q12. However, a weaker USD due to QE3, ongoing social turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa\nand the risk that Iranian tensions have the potential to heat up after the US presidential elections are\nlikely to keep the oil price at around USD 105-110/bbl in 6 months. In addition, demand growth from\nEM countries in 1Q13 could start to gather pace.\n• Base metal prices should hold their ground, with China's growth deceleration coming to an end. So\nwe keep our neutral stance. That said, it is too early to call for a strong extension of the liquidity\ndriven price rally seen until now, despite the RMB 1 trillion in infrastructure approvals by the NDRC\n(National Development and Resource Commission) in rail, highways, ports and other infrastructure\nprojects. Many of the announced projects are already part of the 12th 5-year plan. The incremental\ndemand impact of speeding up investments should therefore be rather muted this time compared with\nprevious stimulus packages. Besides that, China's steel intensity for one unit of RMB of investment (FAI)\nhas halved over the last 5 years.\n• A 15% increase in grain prices remains our base case for 4Q12, with room for prices to top out in\n1Q13. Demand rationing in case of corn and soybeans is still needed to limit the damage done to global\ninventories by lower supply. The quarterly stock and the monthly WASDE report by the USDA are\nreiterating the critical conditions of US grain inventories. The softs, on the other hand, should remain\nunder pressure due to ample South American production and export activity. That said, the sub-sector\nalready weakened quite a bit, which will limit the downside in the short run and we remain neutral.\nPreferences (6 months)\nCommodities\ntotal\nPrecious\nMetals\nEnergy\nBase Metals\nAgricultural\nunderweight\nnew\nneutral\nSource: UBS CIO WM Global Investment Office\nold\noverweight\n34\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nPrecious metals\nC:\\Program Files\\UBS\\Pres\\Templates\\PresPrintOnScreen.pot\nPreference: neutral\nGold (24 Oct): USD 1,702oz (last month: USD 1,764/oz)\nUBS View (gold)\nGold 6-month target: USD 1,875/oz\n• So far we saw inflows into gold of around 4 million ounces via physically backed ETFs since Bernanke's\nspeech at Jackson Hole. We expect this trend to continue and to lead to an undersupplied market, with\nfinancial demand also finding its way into gold futures and physical gold bars and coins.\n• Additional demand support comes from central banks, which are likely to further increase their foreign\nreserve allocation to the yellow metal. At the same time the drag from India's jewelry demand is set to fade\nwith an already lower base in 2H11 and a stabilizing Indian rupee.\n• Securing sufficient investment demand to push prices sharply higher is different from securing the\nneeded demand over a long period of time, and along these lines we see less support for the price over a 6-\nmonth perspective. Secondly, from a portfolio perspective we currently prefer to take some risk off the\ntable instead of on, and we thus maintain our neutral stance on gold.\n� Positive scenario\n6-month target: USD 2,250/oz\n• Unorthodox monetary policy measures by the Fed start to weaken the USD persistently. Moreover, the\nrisk of a Eurozone breakup intensifies, which triggers a tidal wave of investment demand for gold.\n� Negative scenario\n6-month target: USD 1,450/oz\n• A hard landing of China and India or the Fed backing off from the recent monetary policy\nannouncements would be a key drag on the yellow metal. The latter would have the strongest impact.\nRecommendations\nTactical (up to 6 months)\n• Although it is possible for gold to test its\nall-time high in the next three months, we\nare aware that the metal has already\nappreciated firmly ahead of the QE3\nannouncement, which requires an ever\ngrowing amount of investment demand\nto hold the current upward trajectory.\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• To protect investors' portfolios from\nunorthodox monetary policy measures,\nholding gold exposure is a viable and\nattractive strategy. Alternatively, we\nrecommend palladium as well as\nplatinum. Structural supply issues with\nregard to platinum and a reduction in\nRussian stock sales of palladium speak in\nfavor of PGM exposure, despite higher\nvolatility.\nWhat we're watching\nPhysical demand/supply\nInvestment flow\nMonetary policy\nWhy it matters\nIn the months ahead, with the festive season in India starting and monsoon\nactivity having improved considerably, supporting rural incomes, Indian\nphysical demand is likely to pick up. Key dates: World Gold Council mid-\nNovember release.\nMining activity in South Africa is unlikely to return to normal in the coming\nmonths. Hence, we are closely tracking mining news from South Africa,\nincluding the aggregated PGM IP numbers to assess the overall situation.\nIn order to see the gold price reaching our target, investment inflows into\nphysically backed ETFs need to continue.

While Syria's crude oil exports already dropped to near zero due to international sanctions,\nthe oil market's concerns relate to the Kirkuk–Ceyhan oil pipeline (Iraq-Turkey – capacity of 0.4mbpd) and\nthe crude exports from the Turkish port of Ceyhan, around 70km from the Syrian border.\n• Though we believe that Syria and Turkey are not interested in a military confrontation, a stop of crude oil\nflows from Iraq via Turkey would curb global incremental crude oil supply in 4Q12 by more than 50%. It\nwould also tighten up the market balance in early 2013 and put additional pressure on the structurally low\nspare capacity in the crude oil market.\n• In the absence of a further escalation, which remains our base case, ebbing news related to Syria-Turkey is\nlikely to ease supply concerns. This should keep the market focus on weak demand growth and strong\ncrude oil output from North America, allowing the Brent price to temporarily reach USD 95/bbl.\n• A weaker USD, reduced economic tail risk for Europe, ongoing social turmoil in the Middle East and\nNorth Africa and the risk that the Iranian topic heats up again after the US presidential elections are likely\nto keep the Brent price around USD 105-110/oz in 6 months.\n� Positive scenario\nBrent 6-month target: USD 140–180/bbl\n• Iranian oil exports are subject to a complete embargo, which would drain another 0.5–0.75 mbpd of\nglobal crude oil supply. Alternatively, a military confrontation that affects crude oil supply via the Strait of\nHormuz would be the ultimate supply shock, requiring crude oil to be rationed on a large scale.\n� Negative scenario\nBrent 6-month target: USD 75–80/bbl\n• Political tensions lead to a breakup of the Eurozone or intensify the economic contraction. At the same\ntime, the Fed is not successful in promoting growth. Supply-wise, a restoration of Iranian exports and no\nsupply cuts by OPEC would push oil inventories firmly up and weaken Brent prices towards USD 80/bbl.\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nThe biggest risk related to a potential military confrontation is an Israeli air strike\nIran tensions\non nuclear facilities in Iran. A preemptive strike could easily destabilize the region\neven further and threaten global crude oil supply.\nSupply\nChanges in the US gasoline blending mandate with ethanol (made from corn)\nmight fuel higher crude oil prices as spare capacity increases slides further.\nUS crude oil supply progress (room to grow by 1.3 mbpd from 2011 to 2013) is a\nvital offsetting factor to supply outages seen in the MENA region.\nDemand\nMost of China's demand growth seems to be related to stock building (strategic\nand by refineries). If this is true, the import should stay on the weak side y/y.\nRecommendations\nTactical (6 months)\n• OPEC is in a good position to balance the\noil market, which should limit the price\nweakness. Along with central banks'\nsupport and with the geopolitical risks\nremaining, we believe that the potential\ndownside for the oil price has declined,\nthereby warranting allocation.\nStrategic (3–5 years)\n• We regard the long end of the forward\ncurve in crude oil as mispriced. To satisfy\nemerging market demand in the long run,\nprices around USD 90–95/bbl are unlikely\nto secure the needed investments to keep\nsupply growing adequately. This gives\nstrategically oriented crude oil investors\nthe opportunity to build up some longterm\ncrude oil exposure over the next\nthree to five years.\nPetroleum demand in selected markets\nYear-on-year change – in mbpd\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n0.0\n-0.4\n-0.8\n0.3\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\nChina\nLatin\nAmerica\n2012E\n-0.4\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.1\nEurope\nUS\n0.1\n-0.1\nJapan\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\nMiddle\nEast\nOther\nAsia\n2013E\n0.7\n1.0\nWorld\nOil market reports Key date: 13 Nov, IEA Oil market report Source: UBS, as of Oct. 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n36\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nBase metals\nC:\\Program Files\\UBS\\Pres\\Templates\\PresPrintOnScreen.pot\nPreference: neutral\nCurrent (24 Oct) (last month): Copper USD 7,815/mt (8,271); Nickel USD 16,336/mt (18,351);\nAluminum USD 1,912/mt (2,079)\n6-month target: Copper: USD 8,800/mt; Nickel: USD 19,000/mt; Aluminum: USD 2,100/mt\nUBS View\n• After the swift uptick in prices, base metals have been under renewed pressure. The initial price strength\n– a simple catch up with Chinese prices triggered by a shift in demand expectations – is losing strength.\n• In order to continue the price rally, a firm increase in final metal demand is needed. Since global\neconomic growth is far from seeing such a demand uptick in industrial activity during 4Q12, we think that\nprices are likely to trade only sideways in the coming months before trending higher in 1Q13.\n• Loose monetary policy is a good precondition for activity to pick up, but not a guarantee after so many\nrounds of monetary stimulus. We therefore look east to China. Although industrial activity growth in China\nis likely to bottom out, the upcoming leadership change in the country (November 2012 to March 2013),\nwill likely delay a bigger investment program into 1Q13. The latest stimulus program will probably prevent\nChinese IP from decelerating even further, but will not lift it meaningfully higher.\n• On a single commodity level, we favor copper and nickel. For nickel, short-term supply issues due to a\nslower ramp up of new and existing projects have temporarily brought the market closer to balance than\ninitially expected. Furthermore, we should see higher Chinese stainless steel demand with stabilizing\nhousing activity and a demand pick up in stainless steel related products.\n• With regards to copper, we expect import activity to remain strong, as seen in the import figures for\nSeptember. Overall, the copper market should remain undersupplied, which could widen if financial\ndemand is finding some store of value in the metal. We think this puts structurally low LME inventories at\nrisk and should push the metal price towards USD 8,800/mt or higher over six months.\n� Positive scenario\n• China eases monetary policy aggressively, pushing credit growth to 20% y/y. In the US the Fed is able to\nlift GDP growth via QE3 and the ECB puts an effective backstop to declining industrial activity.\n� Negative scenario\n• To passive Chinese authorities keep GDP growth on a constant deceleration path. A severe escalation of\nthe Eurozone crisis (room for a break-up) triggers a setback in investment activity – including in Germany.\nWhat we're watching\nDemand\nSupply\nEconomic data/forward\ncurve\nWhy it matters\nChina's growth deceleration should come to an end. But hard economic activity\nindicators, especially for China, have yet to catch up with the increase in prices.\nHence, the current base metal market is already reflecting considerable growth\ngoodwill that is in need of a demand confirmation by China, the US or Europe.\nCopper output continues to undershoot market expectations and should be\nwatched closely, as investment activity in mines increased sharply. For zinc,\nprospects for mine closures have been delayed and should keep the market\noversupplied.\nChinese economic data – trade data, CPI, IP and loan growth by financial\ninstitutions. Key date: 10-15 Oct\nRecommendations\nTactical (6 months)\n• We reiterate that the strong uptick in\nbase metal prices is skating on thin ice, in\nour view. Real activity has yet to follow\nand support prices over a longer time\nperiod. 50% of the upside potential on a\n6-month horizon is likely to be behind us,\nmaking only copper and nickel attractive,\nwith +10% expected return.\nStrategic (2 years)\n• Although the strongest performance\nshould be visible in zinc and lead, with\nexisting mine capacity expected to peak\nin 2014/15, the recent price strength\nmakes such an investment unattractive\nnow, based on timing. Given a\nstructurally solid supply side, investors\nshould avoid aluminum and nickel. A\nfirmer supply side should also limit the\nupside in copper.\nNet speculative copper position at\nComex are far from being overstretched\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n(20)\n(40)\n(60)\n(80)\nIn thousand contracts\nJan-93 Jan-96 Jan-99 Jan-02 Jan-05 Jan-08 Jan-11\nLong positions Short positions Net long position\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS, as of Oct. 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n37\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nAgriculture\nC:\\Program Files\\UBS\\Pres\\Templates\\PresPrintOnScreen.pot\nPreference: neutral\nCurrent (24 Oct) (last month): Soybeans, USD 15.17/bu (16.12); Corn, USD 7.54/bu (7.44);\nWheat, USD 8.84/bu (8.87)\nUBS View\n6-month target: Soybeans: USD 17.0/bu; Corn: USD 9.0/bu; Wheat: USD 9.5/bu\n• Major US supply surprises on the grains side are rather unlikely in the near term as harvesting is in full\nswing. However, we think that demand is unlikely to drop as quickly as the USDA expects. According to the\nlatest USDA grain stocks and WASDE reports, feed demand remained surprisingly resilient in 3Q12. To\neffectively ration demand, especially on the feed side, in an environment of critically low US corn and\nsoybean stocks, higher prices are still required. For wheat, global production estimates were further\nlowered due to production losses in Australia, EU, Russia for 2012/13, which likely keeps prices supported in\nthe near term. We expect corn and soybean prices to appreciate by 15% in the coming months.\n• On the other side, the softs are likely to remain well supplied, which should keep prices under pressure.\nImproved export activity of coffee and strong stock selling from Vietnam in 4Q12 should weigh on coffee\nprices in the short-term. For sugar, higher production from Brazil and other producers should continue to\nburden prices in the near term, but also offer buying opportunities on a 12-month perspective.\n• Aggregating the above points, the risk/reward for being long across the entire sector is not a given. We\ntherefore reiterate our neutral sector stance.\n� Positive scenario\nCorn 6-month USD 10/bu; Soybeans 6-month USD 19/bu\n• With a reduced probability of El Niño, the yield potential for South American crops is likely to be lower.\nAny deterioration in South American supply prospects would require additional demand to be rationed.\n� Negative scenario\nCorn 6-month USD 6/bu Soybeans 6-month USD 12.5/bu\n• A change of the US ethanol-gasoline blending mandate would be a game changer. Increases in planted\nacreage combined with a steep decline in US demand for exports and feed would weigh on prices.\nRecommendations\nTactical\n• Despite the recent setback in corn prices,\nrisk-seeking investors should still hold on\nto long positions in corn. Demand\nrationing is still required to limit the drag\non inventories. The expected return\ntarget for a long position in corn stands\nat 15%.\nStrategic\n• Our expected return outlook for grains\nstands at around –10% over the next 12\nmonths. With grain prices not far below\nhistorical highs, the supply side is highly\nlikely to expand meaningfully in 2013/14\nand pressurize prices at a later stage.

Despite the good performance the asset class\nremains slightly attractive based the high dividend yield and implied property yield compared to bonds.\nAsia has been the strongest performer and Europe has outperformed the US year-to-date as tail risk was\nreduced by the ECB launching the OMT. QE3 is not an imminent performance driver but provides a support\nfor capital values going forward and helps to keep interest levels low.\n• Due to the current search for yields, listed real estate companies are able to refinance their investments at\nlower yields with longer maturities. The implied property yields to bonds and earnings yields over five-year\nswap rates are even more attractive due to low interest rates offering good opportunities within the global\nreal estate space.\n• Low to decent supply of commercial surfaces helps to push vacancy rates down which in turn increases\nthe rent. We further see capital appreciation as possible in the light of overall stable fundamentals.\n• Asia remain the positive performance generators in our view as this is the more cyclical market, whereas\nAustralia is supported by high dividend yields. Overall Europe remains comparatively weak, while the UK\nand the US have already priced in some market improvements.\n� Positive scenario UBS Global Index DTR (6-month target): 1,650\n• Improving fundamentals maintain listed real estate in fairly valued territory, despite stronger\nperformance as occupancy rates grow faster than expected and rental income accelerate. Ongoing\nreflationary monetary policies across the world help to maintain favorable spreads between rental yields\nand bonds, maintaining real estate as a comparatively attractive asset class. Refinancing costs remain low.\n� Negative scenario UBS Global Index DTR (6-month target): 1,300\n• US, European and Chinese growth rates disappoint investor expectations and cause the comparatively\nhigh valuation levels in the US to partially correct. Furthermore, a more severe recession in Europe triggers\na tightening of credit standards and cuts real estate companies from the capital market, making listed real\nestate more dependent than ever on bank financing. Real estate underperforms global equities.\nWhat we're watching\nCorporate bond yields\nRental yield and capital\nappreciation\nCredit markets and\nfinancing costs\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nWhy it matters\nThis is one of the best indicators for listed real estate as a low yield helps reduce\nfinancing costs. A steep yield curve is furthermore a signal that the overall\neconomic environment is improving. Both are currently supportive.\nThe rental yield is usually inflation linked, as the upcoming supply is currently low\nthis pushes up the occupancy rates and thus increasing the rents. Capital\nappreciation is expected to be stable to positive. Overall are both supportive.\nLending conditions are still challenging for developers and private investors.\nPublic companies by contrast have very good access to credit and capital.\nRecommendations\nTactical (6 months)\n• We continue to be neutral global listed\nreal estate recommending to have\nexposure to the Hong Kong, Singapore\nand Australia markets. The asset class is\noverall slightly attractive on relative\nvaluation and the current low interest\nrate is supportive, but the uncertain\nenvironment warrants a neutral stance.\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• Real estate is supported by several factors\nin the long term.

On the active risk side of the equation, we have seen lower gross\nexposure and net-market exposure within the overall hedge funds group, with traders being cautiously\npositioned. With systemic risk at bay, we favor relative-value (RV ) and event-driven (ED) strategies.\n• The inherent hedging in relative value is appealing. Credit relative-value managers should perform well\nin this environment of higher fixed-income volatility and increasing pricing anomalies created by central\nbank interventions and limited competition.\n• While ED managers share some of the performance drivers, idiosyncratic bets reduce the correlation to\nmarkets. The real reason to own this strategy, however, is the potential for outsized returns in distressed,\nhigh-yield, and other credit investments as the Eurozone crisis plays out.\n� Positive scenario\nPrefer Equity long-short\n• Reduced uncertainty (e.g. resolution in Europe) lowers equities' correlation and volatility. This helps\nbottom-up fundamental analysis and equity long/short managers the most. Also, CEOs will likely make\nmore corporate transactions that can be monetized by event-driven managers, and a clearer\nmacroeconomic environment with more persistent trends would support CTA managers.\n� Negative scenario\nPrefer Trading (Global Macro + CTA)\n• So far this year, the market has remained plagued by short-term reversals, due to central banks'\nintervention and stimulus effects, an obstacle for trend-following managers. Still, if the European\ndeleveraging (or fiscal cliff, China hard landing) is unmanaged, this could threaten risky assets. Trading\ncan do well if such a scenario unfolds.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).\nRecommendations\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• Recommendation: Active risk\nmanagement is instrumental for capital\npreservation during adverse market\nconditions. At the moment, we therefore\nfavor relative-value and event-driven\nstrategies, since they are less correlated to\nequity markets and other risky assets than\ntrading.\n• Value proposition: Hedge funds should\nachieve robust performance over an\nextended horizon, while displaying\nlimited volatility vis-à-vis equities and\nother risky assets. Hedge funds try to\nminimize downside losses in adverse\nmarket conditions (e.g. active risk\nmanagement), which plays a crucial role in\nwealth appreciation.

The\neconomic cycle impacts the strategies differently.\nCorrelation is an important performance/alpha driver for equity long/short, the\nlargest HF strategy by assets under management.\nGross and net leverage are key to monitoring risk.\nThe direction influences certain HF strategies (e.g. convertible arbitrage).\nImportant in particular for large, less nimble HFs, it enables them to enter and\nexit their strategies.\nVolcker rule, USCITS III/IV\nPerformance, year-to-date\nRelative value\nEvent driven\nTrading\nEquity hedge\nHedge Funds\n-2.0% -1.5% -1.0% -0.5% 0.0% 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 4.0% 4.5% 5.0% 5.5%\nSource: HFRI, UBS, as of 31 Sep 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n40\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Cesare Valeggia, cesare.valeggia@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nPrivate equity\nC:\\Program Files\\UBS\\Pres\\Templates\\PresPrintOnScreen.pot\nPrefer small-/mid-cap buyouts in US/emerging markets;\nUBS View\ndistressed debt in Europe\n• Global M&A volume has continued its downward trend since Q4 2010, falling by -20% quarter-by-quarter\nin Q3 2012, with a drastic decline in Europe of -46%, the third lowest quarter since 2001. However, private\nequity withstood the negative M&A environment as global activity grew by +13% in Q3, and the US posted\nits strongest quarter since Q3 2007. The importance of private equity in emerging markets continues to\ngrow, now accounting for 13% of global activity, strongly driven by Asia, but increasingly also by Africa.\n• We prefer buyout strategies in North America, given reasonable valuations, liquid debt markets and our\nhouse view of economic outperformance vs. Europe. Emerging markets offer compelling opportunities for\nPE investors, especially outside the main hubs (China, Brazil), which have become expensive. Distressed\nstrategies which focus on acquiring complex/illiquid loan positions from banks in Europe are also attractive.\n� Positive scenario\nPrefer small-/mid-cap buyout and secondaries\n• An abating Eurozone debt crisis and improved business confidence would increase deal flow and exit\nopportunities for private equity managers, but would also increase entry prices. In such a positive scenario,\nwe would perceive commitment strategies to secondary funds as attractive for building exposure to an\ninvested private equity portfolio.\n� Negative scenario\nPrefer distressed debt\n• A renewed escalation of the debt crisis would significantly impact deal activity, the availability of debt\nand company owners' willingness to sell. At the same time, it would offer even more attractive\nopportunities within distressed strategies and lower entry prices for long-term private equity investors.\nWhat we're watching\nCredit markets\nExit activity\nSector activity\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nWhy it matters\nIn H1 2012, leveraged loan issuance, an important ingredient of PE activity,\ndropped 17% y/y in the US, but over 41% in Europe. The US debt market is\nmuch deeper than Europe, raising over EUR 153bn of leveraged debt, while\nEurope achieved only EUR 16bn in 1H 12 at less attractive conditions.\nExit activity is an important indicator for the health of the PE market and a key\nreturn driver for investors. Despite the difficult macro environment,\ndistributions from portfolio sales (USD 69bn) have held up, and grew 20% yoy.\nTransactions in consumer discretionary and in energy & utilities remain the\nmost preferred sectors for private equity investors in 2012.\nRecommendations\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• In Europe, the ongoing deleveraging has\nled to attractive opportunities for special\nsituations. We thus recommend pursuing\nless liquid investment strategies with a\npreference for debt to benefit from the\nmacroeconomic adjustment process and\nselling pressure for many European banks.\n• We prefer small-/mid-cap buyouts in North\nAmerica given the better economic\noutlook vs. Europe, higher transaction\ncertainty and more attractive entry prices.\n• Investors looking for downside protection\nduring economic uncertainty can consider\nlarge-cap buyouts in the US, which offer\nexposure to large, diversified companies\nat more attractive prices and are\nsupported by liquid debt markets.\n• We advise investors make an ongoing\nallocation to private equity in emerging\nmarkets, which offer an attractive way to\ncapture superior long-term growth and\ngain access to small-/mid-cap companies\nunavailable on the stock market.\nThe US has seen its strongest quarter since\nQ3 2007, while sentiment in Europe remains\nweak\nUSD billions\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nQ1\n2010\nQ2\n2010\nQ3\n2010\nQ4 Q1 Q2 Q3\n2010 2011 2011 2011\nUS Europe RoW\nQ4\n2011\nQ1\n2012\nQ2\n2012\nQ3\n2012\nSource: S&P, UBS CIO, as of October 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Stefan Brägger, stefan.braegger@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nNote: We emphasize the equal importance of fund manager selection and the commitment strategy.
