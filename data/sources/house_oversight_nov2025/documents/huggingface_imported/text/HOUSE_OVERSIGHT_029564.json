  "text": "﻿English is a difficult language......for some! \nThis is a true story from the Japanese Embassy in US!!! \nA few days ago, Prime Minister Mon was given some \nBasic English conversation training before he visits \nWashington and meets president Barack Obama... \nThe instructor told Mon Prime Minister, \nwhen you shake hand with President Obama, please say 'how r u'. \nThen Mr. Obama should say, 'I am fine, and you?' Now, you should \nsay 'me too'. Afterwards we, translators, will do the work for you.' \nIt looks quite simple, but the truth is... \nWhen Mori met Obama, \nhe mistakenly said 'who r u?' Instead of 'How r u?..) \nMr. Obama was a bit shocked but still managed to react with humor: \n'Well, I'm Michelle's husband, ha-ha..' \nThen Mon replied 'me too, ha-ha...'. \nThen there was a long silence in the meeting room.",
