This\nyear, her exclusive Oscar diary\nchronicles close encounters with\nMichelle Williams, Meryl Streep,\nHarvey Weinstein, Nancy Reagan,\nElizabeth Olsen, George Clooney\nand his French doppelganger\nJean Dujardin and, of course, Uggie.\n56 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012\nphotographs by Patrick McMullan and Billy Farrell Agency\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise\nAPRIL 2012 • AVENUE MAGAZINE | 57\nOctavia Spencer, The Help Director Tate\nTaylor,, Viola Davis and George Clooney\nN\navigating our presidential\ncampaign was a piece of cake\ncompared to understanding the\nnuances of the 2011 Oscar race for the\nmost revered artistic honor in the world.\nThis is how nine films fell into the big\npicture.\nThree premiered in Cannes mid-May,\na distant nine months ago, creating an\nOscar campaign as long as any human\npregnancy. At the Palais, the first inkling\nof Oscar buzz was born as the reclusive\nWoody Allen premiered Midnight in\nParis. PBS later aired a documentary of\nWoody discussing his forty-four films\nshowing the astonishing depth of his\ntalent that made you want to immediately\nhand him the Oscar for Best Picture.\nAcademy rules and Woody forbade\nmarketing this gem.\nWoody is not a member of the\nAcademy becase he doesn’t feel that films\nshould be in competition. He told me, “A\nstatue does not change your life. You still\nget a cold. You can’t get a date. You still\nhave everyday things to worry about.”\nThe Academy learned to love him from\na distance and gave him Best Original\nScreenplay as a consolation.\nTerrence Malick’s long-awaited,\nesoteric The Tree of Life was unveiled at\nCannes and won the coveted Palme D’Or,\npositioning it for a nomination.\nThe Artist, created by the French, shot\nin Hollywood and about Hollywood was\nthe festival surprise. This charming and\noddly original black-and-white silent\nentry was introduced by the ringmaster\nhimself, Harvey Weinstein. No one\ncould pronounce or spell director Michel\nHazanavicius’s name. Jean Dujardin\ncould not speak a word of English and\nneither could his 10-year-old co-star, the\nJack Russell Uggie who had been rescued\nfrom the pound after two adopters found\nhim too wild. Tragically Uggie developed\nan undisclosed neurological disorder\nduring production, forcing him to retire\nat the height of his popularity.\nNo slam dunk Oscar winner emerged in\nCannes. Any future film could easily win.\nDreamWorks’ The Help premiered\nin LA in August and distributor Disney\nbegan propelling the politically correct and\nsocially significant film to box office heaven\nof $200 million. Viola Davis and Octavia\nSpencer were forecast to win Oscars.\nIn September, the Toronto and New\nYork Film Festivals and Fox Searchlight\npresented Alexander Payne’s Hawaiian\nfamily saga, The Descendants, which broke\nout of the pack with whispers of winning.\nBeloved George Clooney, playing a\nfather for the first time was hailed as a\nshoo-in for best actor. Directing Ides of\nMarch added momentum.\nAlso at New York’s festival Marty\nScorsese and Paramount sneaked an\nunfinished cut of Hugo in Alice Tully\nHall, built for concerts but converted into\na 3-D theater. Marty was christened the\nvisionary genius of an innovative, costly\n3-D masterpiece.\nDirector Bennett Miller’s highly\nanticipated Moneyball for Sony hit a\ngrand slam at its west coast premiere in\n58 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012\nOakland putting the film, its heart throb star\nBrad Pitt, Jonah Hill and seasoned writers\nSteve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin in play.\nSpielberg’s epic War Horse for DreamWorks\ncame thundering down the pike with a huge\npremiere back at Alice Tully Hall, with\nposters of Lincoln Center’s Tony winning\ntheatrical version and their indelible puppets\nin the background. Steven paid homage to\nlegends John Ford and David Lean and the\ncountry fell in love with a horse named Joey\nand his 14 stand-ins.\nStudios worked their stars to the bone.\nIronically, Harvey Weinstein’s independent\nFrench talent who lived in Paris were not\nas available as their competitors, therefore\nUggie became a superstar igniting a pet war.\nChristopher Plummer, who had Best\nSupporting Actor in the bag promoted his\nJack Russell, Cosmo. Diminutive Scorsese\nwas seen on TV on a small couch with his\nlarge Doberman, Blackie, drooling on his\nsuit. Spielberg never got a chance to trot\nout his lead horse Joey, previously seen in\nSeabiscuit because his ravishing reddish coat\nwas now darkened for another role.\nBy December, as film critics bestowed\ntheir own awards upon many films, Stephen\nDaldry struggled to finish Extremely Loud\nand Incredibly Close with a new score. There\nwas buzz Daldry could be editing the winner.\nProducer Scott Rudin juggled his astounding\nthree films in one year from Daldry, Miller\nand David Fincher directing Girl with the\nDragon Tattoo.\nDaldry has received three consecutive\ndirecting nominations. In January, for\nhis fourth film, he received a Best Picture\nnomination, for a boy’s emotional journey\ndealing with 9/11, and the nine films were\nofficially off and running. Forty-five film and\nmedia groups handed out awards leading up\nto Oscar night.\nMartin Scorcese\nLily Collins\nPrincess Charlene and\nPrince Albert II\nof Monaco\nBerenice Bejo\nand Michel\nHazanaviciu\nMeryl Streep\nMichelle\nWilliams\nWednesday, February 22\nMy airplane seatmate to LAX was\nSony Classics Michael Barker. The night\nbefore Woody Allen had shown Michael\nTo Rome With Love, his new film\nshot in Rome and rumored to be his\nbest. When Woody won the Oscar\nSunday night, for a record breaking\n23rd overall nomination, he had just\nfinished pasta at Sette Mezzo on\nLexington Avenue with art dealer\nLorinda Ash and Soon-Yi. He went\nhome and watched the N.B.A. All-Star\ngame. Soon-Yi watched the awards\nshow on a TiVo delay in another room.\nBrad Pitt and\nAngelina Jolie\nDavid and\nVictoria\nBeckham\nJane Fonda and Richard Perry\nBy the time Woody won, he had fallen\nasleep and Soon-Yi didn’t want to wake him.\nThe next morning he went to the breakfast\ntable alone and read in The New York Times\nthat he had won. He had to think it was a\ngood omen and he would not catch a cold\nthat day.\nBefore Michael and I flattened our\nrecliner chairs for the big sleep, I told him\nI felt confident his Iranian film A Separation\nwould win Best Foreign Film. He told me The\nArtist would take Best Picture and Director.\nActor was a tight race between Brad Pitt,\nJean Dujardin, the “Clooney of France”\nand the real George Clooney. George was\nessentially running against a version of\nhimself, which only slightly amused him.\nThe biggest dilemma was Viola vs. Meryl.\nMichael picked Meryl as New Yorkers did.\nScarlett\nJohansson\nSalma Hayek\nBilly Crystal\nMeryl’s publicist\nLeslee Dart\nwhispered to me.\n“She is dressed like\nan Oscar. What do\nwe do if she loses?”\nTom Hanks and\nRita Wilson\nEmma Stone\n60 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012\nJessica\nChastain\nThe Help had taken on a life of its own lead\nby vivacious Viola in LA. The Iron Lady, a\nmuch criticized film, showcased Meryl’s\ntour-de-force performance. Few knew at\nthe last minute, on President’s weekend,\nHarvey’s shout out, “She hasn’t won in 29\nyears!” resonated.\nAn androgynous driver named Monica\ngreeted me at the airport in a black\ntuxedo that would make Albert Nobbs\nweep for joy, prompting me to devilishly\nthink of her as “Nobbs” all weekend.\nShe barely recognized me sporting a new\nSally Hershberger hairdo, “the yenta with\nthe dragon tattoo.”\nChecking into the Beverly Hills Hotel I\nbumped into Best Actress nominee, Golden\nGlobe and Spirit Award winner Michelle\nWilliams with her daughter Matilda Ledger\nheaded to the swimming pool. Innocently\nstanding there with no makeup she was\nremarkably the antithesis of Marilyn\nMonroe. I told her she so deserved the\nOscar for her mesmerizing transformation\nwhich did not cheer her up knowing the\ngold was going to Viola or Meryl.\nThis year there seemed to be more parties\nthan ever. Vanity Fair publisher Edward\nMenicheschi staged a staggering six\nnights of “CAMPAIGN HOLLYWOOD.”\nErmenegildo Zenga and Colin and\nLivia Firth hosted an intimate dinner at\nthe Chateau Marmont to benefit Oxfam\nAmerica, Colin’s pet charity. Editor\nGraydon Carter and Edward greeted\nCameron Diaz, Kristin Davis, Gary and\nAlexandra Oldman and Mia Wasikowska.\nIn addition, Livia spoke about her ‘Green\nCarpet Challenge’ which uses eco-friendly\nfabrics for “wear it once” gowns at awards\nshows. Get it? Go green on red.\nThursday, February 23\nThursday night boasted 15 events\ncausing party panic. Here is a brief\nrundown of seven.\nAt The Hollywood Reporter’s Nominee\nNight, editor Janice Min and publisher\nLynne Segall greeted the power brokers.\nWith ballots in, competing studios\ncordially mingled in the Mayor’s\nbackyard. Owen Wilson slipped in the\nback door and hung with Michael Sheen\nand producer Letty Aronson. Producers\nKathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall\nchatted with DreamWorks’ partner Stacey\nSnyder, producer Graham King and Emily\nMortimer. Fox’s Tom Rothman and Jim\nGianopulos compared notes with Focus’\nJames Shamus. Young directors Drake\nDoremus (Like Crazy), Sean Durkin (Martha\nMarcy May Marlene) and Oscar nominee\nand Spirit Award winner J.C. Chandor\n(Margin Call) drank at the bar. Breakout\ndirectors Nick Jarecki (Arbitrage), Zal\nBatmanglij (Sound of My Voice and\nThe East) and Jay Duplass (Jeff Who\nLives at Home) dreamed about their\nfuture nominations. Aaron Sorkin,\nPiers Morgan and Lawrence O’Donnell\nhandicapped Romney vs. Obama as\nBrooklyn Decker sashayed by.\nUrs Fisher’s exhibition Beds & Problem\nPaintings featured two bed sculptures at\nLarry Gagosian’s Gallery followed by his\nprivate dinner at Mr. Chow’s. Art lovers Vera\nWang, Russell Simmons, Steve Martin, Jean\nPigozzi and John Waters attended.\nThe US-Ireland Alliance honored\nnominees Hugo screenwriter John Logan,\nBridesmaids star Melissa McCarthy and\nMichelle Williams at Bad Robot. Logan also\nwrote Rango, Coriolanus, 007’s Skyfall and\nJersey Boys for the big screen.\nJennifer Lopez\nDiane\nKruger\nTerry Richardson\nRooney Mara\nGraydon Carter and Anna Scott\nAPRIL 2012 • AVENUE MAGAZINE | 61\n\nFran Leibowitz\nMichael Douglas and Kirk Douglas\nWendi Deng Murdoch\nAbbie Cornish\nBar Refaeli\nWoody is not a member of the\nAcademy because he doesn’t feel\nthat films should be in competition.\nHe told me, “A statue does not change\nyour life. You still get a cold. You can’t\nget a date. You still have everyday\nthings to worry about.”\nAlfre Woodard hosted a down and\ndirty girls night out in a rented house\nabove Sunset for Viola Davis and Octavia\nSpencer.\nUniversal honcho Ron Meyer hosted a\ncivilized private buffet at his Malibu home\nfor Graydon Carter with Tom Cruise,\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Barbra Streisand,\nTom Hanks and Michael Douglas.\nStunning socialite Betsey Bloomingdale\ngave a seated dinner at her Holmby Hills\nhome for best friends Nancy Reagan,\nWendy Stark, Bob Colacello, Joan\nCollins and fashion icon Lynn Wyatt.\nTobias Meyer, auctioneer for Sotheby’s\nand art dealer Mark Fletcher hosted\nan open house at their Mulholland\nDrive home for American avant-garde\nphotographer Terry Richardson. This is\nthe only pre-Oscar party where a guest\ndropped his pants and mooned the red\ncarpet and Terry signed a fans breast.\nArt collectors Bill and Maria Bell, Todd\nEberle, rock singer Jack Donahue and\nFrancesco Clemente schmoozed.\nFriday, February 24\nAt the BHH I ran into David Heyman,\nEnglish producer of the Harry Potter\nfranchise who was honored at the\nPublicists Awards lunch at The Beverly\nHilton. “Motion Picture Showman of the\nYear” was the consolation prize for being\nsnubbed by the Academy for visualizing\na publishing miracle for children around\nthe world.\n“Nobbs” whisked me off to the\nBritish Film Reception hosted by\nJeremy Hunt, UK Secretary of State for\nCulture and Olympics and the British\nConsul-General Dame Barbara Hay,\nin her Hancock Park residence. Upon\nintroduction, I blurted out that my friend\nLord Astor was interested in having\nL.A. people get to know his son-in-law,\nPrime Minister David Cameron. As an\nappointed diplomat she was horrified by\nmy indiscretion and turned to greet the\nnext American idiot. I was just making\nconversation.\nDaldry told Sony’s Sir Howard\nStringer and astute film CEO Michael\nLynton, Kenneth Branagh, Janet McTeer\nand Gary Oldman that he, as executive\nproducer of the Olympics, was headed\nback to London to oversee special events,\nincluding the opening ceremony, directed\nby Danny Boyle. Victoria Beckham\n62 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012\nmade a dramatic, sullen, last-minute\nappearance looking perfectly skinny in a\ndress from her eponymous collection.\nAt the Women in Film cocktail party\nat Cecconi’s, Gwyneth Paltrow, Shailene\nWoodley, Selena Gomez and Vanessa\nHudgens networked with Jessica, Octavia\nand Viola now of social stamina fame.\nBlythe Danner kissed me at the door\nas a military-type looked on. I kept saying\nto him, “Where have we met?” Nowhere.\nHe was astronaut Mark E. Kelly who\ncame with Blythe and is married to\nformer congresswoman Gabrielle\nGiffords, Paltrow’s second cousin. Only\nI could mistake an astronaut for a movie\nmarketing guy.\nVanity Fair fêted Scorsese and The\nFilm Foundation, which has saved 555\nfilms in 22 years. Cocktails were at the\nrestored Bel-Air Hotel. Honorary Jewess\nLorraine Bracco ran past me yelling\nthat she was late for Ronald Perelman’s\nShabbat dinner. Three, three-time Oscar\nwinners: composer Howard Shore,\ncostume designer Sandy Powell and editor\nThelma Schoonmaker were honored.\nSir Ben Kingsley, Danny Huston, Patty\nClarkson, Irwin Winkler and Giorgio\nArmani’s niece Roberta Armani with\nWanda McDaniels debated best\ndirector: Marty or Michel?\n“Nobbs” delivered me to WME’s\nParty at kahuna Ari Emanuel’s\nBrentwood estate, where NFL\nquarterback and new client\nTim Tebow was the toast of\nthe party, especially to Taylor\nSwift who made $35.7 million\nthis year. Michael Douglas\ngave me a kiss… doesn’t\nget any better. Longtime\nlovebirds Robert Pattinson\nand Kristen Stewart made\na rare appearance, glued\nto each other’s hips.\nThey mingled with costar\nTaylor Lautner,\nMiley Cyrus, and her\nHunger Games beau Liam\nZoe\nSaldana\nHemsworth. Meanwhile\nCharlize Theron, Jack\nBlack, Rooney Mara, Ben\nStiller, Barry Sonnenfeld\nand Larry David talked\nbusiness with moguls Les\nMoonves and Viacom’s\nPhilippe Dauman.\nNext was UTA Chairman\nFelicity Jones\nBrooklyn\nDecker\nJim Berkus’ soiree that police almost\nshut down because the DJ got carried\naway impressing Harrison Ford,\nChanning Tatum, Jerry Bruckheimer,\nTom Freston, Disney’s Rich Ross,\nSNL’s Lorne Michaels and Oscar show\nproducer Brian Grazer.\nSunset Tower Hotel owner Jeff Klein\nand producer John Goldwyn hosted a\nsecret dinner for Anna and Graydon\nCarter at their Hollywood Hills home\nwith Tom Ford, Mitch Glazer, Fran\nLebowitz, Vito Schnabel, Denise Hale,\nLisa and Eric Eisner and VF’s Punch\nHutton, who is Tim Hutton’s sister.\nLast stop was CAA Byran Lourd’s\n“Friday Night Party”. “Nobbs”\nwas instructed to drop me off at a\nneighborhood school where a luxury van\ntransported guests to the stone and glass\nBel-Air estate situated on a narrow street.\nI knew that guests Colin Firth, Penelope\nCruz, Sofia Vergara, Salma Hayek,\nSandra Bullock, and Glee’s Matthew\nMorrison did not arrive by bus. Once\ninside the playing field leveled out and\npound for pound there was more famous\nflesh per square inch than the Oscars\nMiley Cyrus\nthemselves.\nI huddled with Meryl on the couch and\nwe talked about her race. She thought\nViola. I thought Meryl. She didn’t know\nabout Harvey’s last-minute “29 year”\nshout out.\nI hugged Bette Midler and flirted\nwith Jim Sturgess and Bennett Miller.\nUniversal’s Donna Langley, who is\noverseeing Tom Hooper’s production\nLes Miserables, mentioned Hugh\nJackman’s impeccable manners should\ninsure best behavior from Russell Crowe.\nI introduced HBO’s Game Change\ndirector Jay Roach, who is an authority\non Hitler, to George Clooney who is\nwriting a thriller about the Nazis stealing\nart. Clooney whispered, “The Frenchman\nis winning.”\nI thanked Bryan Lourd, Kevin Huvane\nand Richard Lovett, got on the bus and\nprayed that I get invited back.\nSaturday, February 25\nI dragged my tired ass to the Academy,\nas foreign film aficionado Mark Johnson\nwas conducting a symposium on the\nnominated films, which included Sony\nAPRIL 2012 • AVENUE MAGAZINE | 63\nColin Firth and Livia Giuggiolo\nNatalie\nPortman\nClassic’s Footnote from Israel and A\nSeparation from Iran. From the other\nside of the world both governments\nmonitored their directors as the Sony\nboys kept the peace.\nMichael and Tom Bernard invited me\nto the Independent Spirit Awards at the\nSanta Monica Pier. Michael hosted his\nTake Shelter nominees Jessica Chastain,\nMichael Shannon and director J e ff\nNichols. Tom held court at the next\ntable with the entire Iranian cast of A\nSeparation, which won. Tom almost had\na heart attack when I threw my arms\naround Iranian director Asghar Farhadi,\nwhich in Iran is unacceptable behavior,\nespecially by a Jewish American Princess.\nTom wished I had gone to the crowded\nchampagne brunch in honor of Prince\nAlbert and Princess Charlene at the Bel-\nAir Hotel where Montblanc launched\nGrace Kelly watches. Simultaneously,\nTV producer Gary Pudney hosted\nanother secretive, lunch which Albert\nand Charlene actually attended with\nGraydon Carter, Carolina Herrera,\nWallace Annenberg, Bobby Shriver,\nBobby Marx, Kathy and Ricky Hilton\nand Lynn Wyatt. Wolfgang Puck\njoined them for dessert.\n“The French,” as the The\nArtist gang was nicknamed, had\nwon six Césars, France’s version\nof the Oscars, in Paris the night\nbefore. They flew all night and\nHarvey’s chauffeur arranged a\npolice escort from LAX just in\ntime for them to win four Spirit\nAwards, cementing the Oscar\nwin.\nBack at the BHH, Spielberg\nwas the first to arrive at the\ntenth annual “Night Before”\nfundraiser in support of the\nMotion Picture and Television\nFund. Jeffrey Katzenberg had\nalready secured $200 of a $350\nmillion fundraising goal that\nincluded money from him,\nTom Cruise, Steve Bing,\nCasey Wasserman, Clooney\nand Spielberg. Every nominee\nshowed up.\nChanel and Charles Finch\ncooked up their chic soiree at\nMadeo, where a mariachi band\nenthusiastically announced\neveryone’s arrival. Bedecked\nexclusively in Chanel were Diane\nKruger, Elizabeth Olsen, Rose Byrne,\nGinnifer Goodwin and Rachel Bilson.\nAlso air kissing were Rachel Zoe,\nRosanna Arquette, Alice Evans and\nIoan Gruffudd, Zachary Quinto, Julia\nOrmond and Dustin Hoffman.\nMy Week With Marilyn’s English\ndirector Simon Curtis insisted we join\nKenneth Branagh at The Weinstein\nOlivia Wilde\nCompany’s bash at the Soho House in\ntime to hear Tony Bennett sing “Autumn\nLeaves” to Harvey’s surprised 86-yearold\nmother Miriam, Madonna and\nMeryl. Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo,\nMichel Hazanavicius and producer\nThomas Langmann staggered around\ncompletely jet lagged, too tired to speak\nEnglish. Uggie on the other hand was\nthe absolute star of the evening as his\ntrainer placed him in everyone’s arms\nfor photos. W.E’s Andrea Riseborough\nand Abbie Cornish sat next to baseball\ncap-clad Leonardo DiCaprio as his ex,\nBar Refaeli, kept her distance across\nthe room. Zoe Saldana walked in\nholding hands with Bradley Cooper.\nScarlett Johansson introduced me to\nher boyfriend Nate Naylor. Katy Perry,\nFelicity Jones and Malin Akerman\ncircled a refreshed Gerard Butler. The\ntwo daughters of New York slain hero cop\nPeter Figoski, Corrine, 14 and Caroline,\n16 who had also been Harvey’s guests at\nthe Super Bowl stood in the middle of\nthis circus and just fainted.\nSunday, February 26\nI met interior designer Nicky Haslam\nin the Polo Lounge and found Nancy\nReagan brunching with Bob Colacello\nand Carolina Herrera. Nancy knows me\nas “The DVD Lady”. I promised to send\nher The Iron Lady. I didn’t have the heart\nto tell her that her late husband, who was\nMargaret Thatcher’s best friend, was\nbarely mentioned in the film.\nIn a Marchesa gown, Dennis Basso\nfur and Iradj Moini necklace, I collected\nSimon Curtis and headed to the\nHollywood & Highland Center. Simon,\nwho has never been to the Oscars before,\nmiraculously scored a front row seat\nbetween Michelle Williams and Clooney.\nWe pulled up to screams of hysteria at the\nmother of all red carpets.\nMeryl’s publicist Leslee Dart\nwhispered to me. “She is dressed like\nan Oscar. What do we do if she loses?”\nSacha Baron Cohen hilariously guilted\nthe Academy into letting him wear his\ncostume from The Dictator and, after\nsoiling Ryan Seacrest, he went directly\nto dinner at Vanity Fair. Gwyneth\nPaltrow won the style award in Tom\nFord’s white column and Angelina Jolie\nso successfully invented a new one legged\npose in a thigh high slit gown on the red\ncarpet she repeated it for 39.3 million\n64 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012\nI introduced HBO’s Game Change director\nJay Roach, who is an authority on Hitler, to\nGeorge Clooney who is writing a thriller\nabout the Nazis stealing art. Clooney\nwhispered, “The Frenchman is winning.”\npeople onstage.\nTickets were so tight that I gave my plus\none to Penelope Ann Miller because she\npromoted The Artist every day for four\nmonths. Seated next to us were co-stars\nJames Cromwell and Missi Pyle.\nBilly Crystal made us laugh, Cirque de\nSoleil made us gasp and most of the wins\nwere expected.\nColin Firth crowned Meryl her third\nwin on a record 17 nominations and\nHarvey beamed.\nThe Academy was so confident The\nArtist would win, they invited Uggie,\nwho waited in the wings and ran out as\nTom Cruise announced the film.\nOnce the show was off the air, I followed\nmy seatmates to the stage loaded with\ntheir programs, wraps and handbags and\nled the French to the press rooms.\nThe Governor’s Ball was the next\nstop where the winners got their Oscars\nengraved. Everyone paid respects to\nthe Academy’s Tom Sherak and Dawn\nHudson. Stars headed to the Sunset Tower\nto Graydon’s glittering Vanity Fair Oscar\nbash and their militarized security with\nmicro chipped cards. If your name was\nnot on the list and you were carrying an\nOscar, you could walk in. Billy and Janice\nCrystal were mobbed with well wishers.\nElton John made $5 million dollars at his\n20th AmFar event which also auctioned\noff two tickets to Vanity Fair’s party for\n$230,000.Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\nwere thrilled to talk to George Lucas.\nGwyneth snuggled with Coldplay’s Chris\nMartin and Jennifer Lopez brought boy\ntoy Casper Smart. Every major actor\npreviously mentioned is standing in the\nroom. Spotted in a sea of celebrity were\nTina Fey, Glenn Close, Olivia Wilde\nand Jason Sudeikis, Terry George, Jane\nFonda, Demian Bichir, Claire Danes,\nMeryl’s daughters Mamie Gummer with\nhusband Ben Walker, Grace Gummer,\nSalma Hayek, Brit Marling, Natalie\nPortman, Sofia Coppola, Peter Brant,\nStephanie Seymour, Ryan Kavanaugh,\nIngrid Sischy, Sandy Brant and Wendi\nMurdoch with Bingbing Li.\nGeorge Clooney threw his own\nexclusive after party at Craig’s in West\nHollywood for close friends Bryan\nLourd, Grant Heslov, Stan Rosenfield,\nBrad and Angelina, Emily Blunt and\nJohn Krasinski, Cindy Crawford,\nJimmy Kimmel, Ryan Seacrest and best\nadapted screenplay winner Alexander\nPayne.\nGeorge and Brad cancelled each\nother out with two great performances.\nClooney immediately returned to his best\nrole as humanitarian, flew to the Sudan,\nmet with Obama and was dramatically\narrested at a protest.\n“The French” threw a wild\ncelebration at the Chateau\nMarmont, poured champagne\ndown their throats and threw\neach other in the pool at 3:00\na.m. Nobody spoke English.\nBy 4:00 a.m. Harvey\nrounded up his artists for a\nlive broadcast on The Today\nShow from The Four Seasons\nlobby. In disheveled black tie,\nfive Oscar winners, all total\nunknowns a year ago, made Oscar\nhistory with the first silent film to\nwin since 1927.\nIt wasn’t God, but 5,800\nAcademy voters who said they\nwon. This had to be the most\nexciting night of their lives. The\nglory and memories live forever.\nThe next day they went back\nto reality . As Woody says, “A\nstatue does not really change\nyour life. You still get a cold.”\nUggie was invited\nto the White House\ncorrespondent’s dinner as\na guest of the Washington\nTimes in April.
