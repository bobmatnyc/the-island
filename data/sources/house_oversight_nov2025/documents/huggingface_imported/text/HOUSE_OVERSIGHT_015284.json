  "text": "the riots consisted of white lynch mobs attacking blacks, and blacks\nfighting back. This reaction to a boxing match was one of the most\nwidespread racial uprisings in the U.S. until the 1968 assassination of civil\nrights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.”\n\nZirin points out that “There was a time in Texas when it was illegal\nto teach slaves to read. The fear was that ideas could turn anger often\ndirected inward into action against those with their boots on black necks.\nIt is perhaps the most fitting possible tribute to Jackie Robinson and Jack\nJohnson that they still strike fear into the hearts of those wearing the\nboots.”\n\nIn the Dallas County jail, one of the largest in the country, a//\npublications are refused, including daily newspapers such as the Dallas\nMorning News. “They seem to have a rather callous disregard for the\nConstitution,” said Paul Wright, publisher of Seattle-based Prison Legal\nNews, with a circulation of 9,000. He filed a federal lawsuit challenging the\nban on First Amendment grounds, and won. His lawyer, Scott Medlock,\nprisoner rights attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project, points out that\nsome jails have argued that prisoners can watch TV news in jail, so they\n\ndon’ t need access to publications.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015284",
