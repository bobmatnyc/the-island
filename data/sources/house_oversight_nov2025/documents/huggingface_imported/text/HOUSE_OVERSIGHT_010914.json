What I love about it is the chance to prove ideas. |\nlove Wall Street innovations such as swaps and futures and ETFs and mortgage-\nbacked securities, even admitting their dangers. And who would have thought that\nthe San Francisco Bay area, a stronghold of political correctness at the voters’ booth,\nwould nonetheless innovate Siri and Alexa and driverless cars, in its free market\nhavens here and there, over the past five years?
