I'm not sure I know how to ask her to join this\ncompany without asking her to be\n\npart of poetry in america. It does also seem to me perhaps relevant that Serena thinks of herself as a poetry\nperson.\n\nFor people who think that way, maybe not nothing (hasn't been nothing to others) that a Harvard poetry\nprofessor seeks her wisdom on the art form?\n\nWould really appreciate your edit.\nLisa\n\nOn Sun, Nov 25, 2018 at 6:41 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\nsorry , that was meant as a filler what is important is that she is joining the others priority . and not\nappearing on your show. !:) iinvite you to appear is DOA\n\nOn Sun, Nov 25, 2018 at 7:39 PM Lisa New __.- wrote:\n\nthis poem about childbirth and is not for children.\nIt's for adults and it raises awareness on the issues of discrimination against women athletes in sports\nand, against women of color in childbirth.

Fingers crossed.\n\nI'm going upstairs to hunt for my copy of Lolita, or will get on my kindle and reread on our way to\nAustralia. I may have lent it to one of my kids. I would recommend reading My Antonia by Cather next\ntime you're on a long plane trip. The prose is gorgeous, and the book has-- come to think of it-- similar\nthemes to Lolita in that it's about a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young\ngirl.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029593",
