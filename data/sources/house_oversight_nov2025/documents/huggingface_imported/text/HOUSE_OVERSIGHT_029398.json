Because a suit against\nDonald Trump alleging that he raped a 13-year-old girl has new life.\nOn Monday, Florida criminal defense lawyer J. Cheney Mason—best known for successfully\ndefending Casey Anthony, who was charged with killing her 2-year-old daughter—filed court papers\nto represent “Jane Doe” in a suit against Trump and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.\nNew Firepower in Shocking Suit Against Trump | Law.com\nhttp://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/10/10/new-firepower-in-shocking-suit-against-tr...\nPage 2 of 3\n10/11/2016\nThe rape suit isn’t exactly new. It was filed pro se by “Katie Johnson” in Los Angeles federal court in\nApril, dismissed, refiled in the Southern District of New York, withdrawn and refiled on Sept. 30. But\nwith the addition of Mason—a media-savvy lawyer not known for shying away from the\nspotlight—the stakes have changed.\nSuddenly, it’s a lot more serious. Which is not the same as legitimate, but\nthe odds that the case will go away quietly are much slimmer given the\nfirepower of her new counsel. Especially now, in the wake of a 2005\nrecording where Trump bragged about using his star power to kiss and\ngrope women.\nThe allegations in the suit are truly awful. Jane Doe says that when she was\n13, she attended parties at Epstein’s New York City townhouse, enticed by\npromises of money and a modeling career. She allegedly had sexual\nencounters with Trump on four occasions there.\nThe complaint states, “Defendant Trump tied plaintiff to a bed, exposed\nhimself to plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape plaintiff. During the\ncourse of this savage sexual attack, plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no\neffect. Defendant Trump responded to plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking plaintiff in the face with\nhis open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.”\nEpstein allegedly raped her as well. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage girl for\nprostitution, and has faced other suits by women who allege underage sexual assault.\nTrump’s lawyer Alan Garten, has unequivocally denied the allegations. In fact, the current complaint\nquotes his denial: “The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level\nand clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is\nabsolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.” Doe’s suit claims that this statement is libelous.\nThe only reason I can think of for including such a seemingly absurd claim (how can you libel\nsomeone who is anonymous?) is that it’s not time-barred. The rest of the complaint probably is.\nThe alleged incidents took place in 1994—22 years ago. The complaint claims that Doe didn’t come\nforward because she was “unrelentingly threatened by each defendant that, were she ever to reveal\nany of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by defendants, plaintiff and her\nfamily would be physically harmed if not killed.”\nBut Epstein in 2008 was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Why couldn’t she have come forward\nthen?\nThat’s not the only problem with the case.\nI wrote about the suit when it was first filed in LA with great skepticism—“an anonymous stink\nbomb,” I called it.\nIn large part, I was dubious because the person filing the complaint, “Katie Johnson,” claimed her\nonly past work experience was as a freelance model. And yet her pro se complaint was perfectly\nformatted, with proper margins and numbering; it correctly cited statutes, got the venue and\njurisdiction correct and contained no typos.\nNew Firepower in Shocking Suit Against Trump | Law.com\nhttp://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/10/10/new-firepower-in-shocking-suit-against-tr...\nPage 3 of 3\n10/11/2016\nIt looked more to me like the secret handiwork of a lawyer intent on smearing Trump.\nIf so, however, there was no way to hold anyone accountable. The phone number provided was\ndisconnected and Johnson’s address was an abandoned, foreclosed house.\nThe allegations in the latest complaint by “Jane Doe” are the same, albeit with fewer lurid details and\nno explanation why she is no longer Katie Johnson. But the biggest difference is that she’s got\nlawyers now.\nIn addition to Mason, “Jane Doe” is represented—improbably—by New Jersey patent litigator\nThomas Meagher, the managing partner of nine-lawyer IP boutique Meagher Emanuel Laks Goldberg\n& Liao.\nMason and Meagher did not respond to requests for comment.\nCampaign finance records show that Mason gave $2,000 to Hillary Clinton in February. Meagher\nduring this election cycle has donated to Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush. He has\nnever given money to a Democrat, according to Open Secrets data.\nSo is the suit for real? Or is it an especially dirty way to attack Donald Trump?\nThere’s a You Tube video of the plaintiff, with her faced blurred and her voice distorted, where she\nrecounts the rape. Under these conditions, it’s impossible to tell if she’s credible or not.\nThe complaint also includes an affidavit from “Joan Doe,” a school friend who said the plaintiff told\nher about the rapes in 1994, and from “Tiffany Doe,” who said she recruited the plaintiff to come to\nEpstein’s parties and witnessed the sexual assaults. So perhaps more evidence will emerge to bolster\nJane Doe’s claims.\nOn the other hand, if the complaint is determined to be without merit, Mason and Meagher could be\nsanctioned by the court for filing a frivolous lawsuit.\nOr Trump could respond like Alan Dershowitz, who was also accused of sexual misconduct with a\nminor in connection with Epstein. The Harvard Law School professor said lawyers for the accuser\nacted unethically and fabricated the allegations; in turn, they sued him for defamation. The case\nsettled earlier this year on undisclosed terms.\nIn the Trump case, U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams set an initial conference for Dec. 16. The real\nquestion: if Clinton wins, will this case simply disappear?\nJenna Greene can be reached at jgreene@alm.com. On Twitter: @JgreeneJenna\n© Copyright 2016. ALM Media Properties, LLC.
