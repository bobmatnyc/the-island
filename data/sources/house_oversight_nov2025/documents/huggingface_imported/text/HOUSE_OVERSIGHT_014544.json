Both\nfactors depend on policy changes, and we do not\nhave any definitive reason to be either optimistic or\npessimistic at this time.\n\nThe second component of the unfavorable\ndemographics perspective has been the drop in\nlabor force participation, particularly among\nmales. Exhibit 10 shows the rapid growth in labor\nforce participation that occurred as the baby\nboom generation reached working age and as\nwomen joined the labor force in growing numbers\nafter 1950. The labor force participation rate,\nhowever, peaked in 2000 and declined by 0.3%\n\na year until it troughed at 62.4% in September\n2015. Most of the drop was driven by three\nfactors: significant decline in male labor force\nparticipation, retirement of baby boomers and the\ncyclical decline in demand for labor as a result\n\nof the global financial crisis. Some of the cyclical\ndecline reversed as the economic recovery entered\nits eighth year: the participation rate has risen to\n62.7% as of November 2016.\n\nThe male labor force participation, however,\nhas been declining, coincidentally also by 0.3%\n\nExhibit 10: US Labor Force Participation Rate\nBoth cyclical and structural factors have contributed to a\ndecline in the participation rate from the 2000 peak.\n\n%\n70\n\n68 + 67.3\n66\n64 4\n62 62.7\n60 4\n58\n56 +\n54\n52 4\n\n50 +\n1950 1956 1962 1966 1974 1980 1986 1992 1998 2004 2010 2016\n\nData through November 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\n\nper year—but since 1952. The trend has occurred\nacross all age cohorts. An important driver of this\ndecline has been reduced demand for lower-skilled\nand less-educated males. The US ranks 32 out of\n34 OECD countries in participation of prime-age\n(between the ages of 24 and 54) males in the labor\nforce, ahead of only Italy and Israel. A Council of\nEconomic Advisers report in June 2016 attributed\nthat low ranking to the fact that the US spends\n\nless than other OECD countries on job search\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 11\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014544",
