  "text": "Prison Legal News is also preparing a lawsuit against the Utah\nDepartment of Corrections for a policy that bars all books except those\nthat are shipped directly from Barnes & Noble. Generally, prisons require\nthat books be sent directly from the publisher or a major distributor, for\nsecurity reasons. Otherwise, a spokesperson for one jail explains,\n\n“There’ s a possibility something could be in one of the pages that we\ndon’ t want. There could be little bits of drugs in the pages.”\n\n“We have not yet sued them.” Wright told me, “since they only\nsporadically censor us and aren’ t letting us develop a good fact\npattern.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’ s Department\nsaid that its jails allow inmates to receive books from booksellers after\nchecking to see whether they can be fashioned into a weapon, promote\nviolence or have sexually explicit content. Across the country, only\npaperbacks are accepted. Hardcovers are rejected because they provide\n\n“source material” for fashioning weapons. When the Supreme Court\nruled that law libraries did not have to be provided to prisoners, jails in\nMontana not only removed the entire contents of the law library, but they\n\nalso removed the typewriters.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015285",
