  "text": "PROLOGUE:\nAILES AND BANNON\n\nhe evening began at six-thirty, but Steve Bannon, suddenly among the world’s most\npowerful men and now less and less mindful of time constraints, was late.\n\nBannon had promised to come to this small dinner arranged by mutual friends in a\nGreenwich Village town house to see Roger Ailes, the former head of Fox News and the\nmost significant figure in right-wing media and Bannon’s sometime mentor. The next day,\nJanuary 4, 2017—little more than two weeks before the inauguration of his friend Donald\nTrump as the forty-fifth president—Ailes would be heading to Palm Beach, into a forced,\nbut he hoped temporary, retirement.\n\nSnow was threatening, and for a while the dinner appeared doubtful. The seventy-six-\nyear-old Ailes, with a long history of leg and hip problems, was barely walking, and,\ncoming in to Manhattan with his wife Beth from their upstate home on the Hudson, was\nwary of slippery streets. But Ailes was eager to see Bannon. Bannon’s aide, Alexandra\nPreate, kept texting steady updates on Bannon’s progress extracting himself from Trump\n‘Tower.\n\nAs the small group waited for Bannon, it was Ailes’s evening. Quite as dumbfounded\nby his old friend Donald Trump’s victory as most everyone else, Ailes provided the\ngathering with something of a mini-seminar on the randomness and absurdities of politics.\nBefore launching Fox News in 1996, Ailes had been, for thirty years, among the leading\npolitical operatives in the Republican Party. As surprised as he was by this election, he\ncould yet make a case for a straight line from Nixon to Trump. He just wasn’t sure, he\nsaid, that Trump himself, at various times a Republican, Independent, and Democrat,\ncould make the case. Still, he thought he knew Trump as well as anyone did and was eager\nto offer his help. He was also eager to get back into the right-wing media game, and he\nenergetically described some of the possibilities for coming up with the billion or so\ndollars he thought he would need for a new cable network.\n\nBoth men, Ailes and Bannon, fancied themselves particular students of history, both\nautodidacts partial to universal field theories. They saw this in a charismatic sense—they\nhad a personal relationship with history, as well as with Donald Trump.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019883",
