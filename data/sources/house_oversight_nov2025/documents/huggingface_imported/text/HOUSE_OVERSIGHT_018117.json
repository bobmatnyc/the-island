But a war might not\nend cleanly, and the U.S. administration could find itself in a messy\nand protracted conflict. This suggests the need for both an expansive\napproach to net assessment and deep and broad preparation not just\nof the military but also of the “home front” and the economy, for Iran\nmay choose to fight on these fronts as well as within its own borders\nand in the region.\n\nHow well prepared is the United States for this kind of fight? This is\nat least in part a question of national or societal resilience. If all\noptions are on the table, as both Bush and Obama Administration\nspokesmen have insisted, are preparations for employing all options\nbeing made ready? If not, then Iran may decide that some of the\noptions on the table lack credibility.\n\nThe second conclusion we should take from this discussion is that, in\nattacking Iran, we would be trading one set of risks for another. Any\noption we choose, even choosing not to choose, will have political as\nwell as military-strategic consequences. As hard as it is to know the\nconsequences of war, it is just as hard to know the consequences of a\ndecision to “learn to live” with a nuclear-armed Iran. Both courses\nare fraught and logically open-ended. Thus the fear of potentially\nnegative consequences from a war should not necessarily rule one\nout. Winston Churchill, reflecting on British policy before World\nWar II, wrote:\n\nIf the circumstances are such as to warrant it, force may be used. And\nif this be so, it should be used under the conditions which are most\nfavourable. There is no merit in putting off a war for a year if, when it\ncomes, it is a far worse war or one much harder to win.17\n\nIn any case, if the United States decides to attack Iran it should\ncertainly look before it leaps and prepare itself for a hard landing.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018117",
