Edwards, who said he was working pro bono,\nknew that this suit against the government would not allow for\nmonetary recovery of any sort (including lawyers’ fees). But he\nalso knew that if the government, urged by Jeffrey Epstein, had\nentered into a contract that improperly or illegally violated the\nrights of Epstein’s victims, then that contract, by nature, would\nhave been improper in and of itself—in which case, the only\ntemedy would have been to have the contract invalidated. And\nwhile it is difficult to know what, exactly, would happen if the\ncontract is overturned, one possibility is that the government\ncould prosecute Epstein for crimes against his victims, if the\n\n| Statute of limitations on those crimes has not expired.\n\nAt the time of this writing, that case is winding its way\n\n_ through the courts. It has all the earmarks of a modern-day\n| Bleak House—the Charles Dickens novel about a legal case that\n“iS so massive and so complex that it drags on forever and drags\n\n| everyone involved into the mire.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010532",
