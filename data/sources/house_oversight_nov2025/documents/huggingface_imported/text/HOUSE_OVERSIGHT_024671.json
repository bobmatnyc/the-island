  "text": "ACKRELL\nCAPITAL CHAPTER Ill Cannabis Industry Segmentation\nCompared to indoor cultivation facilities that use electrical lighting, greenhouse and outdoor facili-\nties are generally less expensive to operate and more appropriate for large-scale projects, but provide less\ncontrol over growing conditions. The use of natural sunlight provides substantial savings on lighting\nequipment and energy costs, but may limit the number of grow cycles per year. Outdoor and green-\nhouse environments are more exposed to environmental risks that may negatively affect crops, such as\npests, contaminants and adverse weather. Outdoor and greenhouse cultivation facilities are prevalent in\n\nOregon, California and certain Latin American countries, which have climates conducive to outdoor\n\ngrowing.\n\nTae\n\nOutdoor Greenhouses\n\nThe Business of Cannabis Cultivation\n\nCultivation businesses must navigate a host of operational challenges, including state and local licensing\nrequirements, facility design and construction, research and acquisition of cannabis strains, intellectual\nproperty protection, cultivation process engineering, supply-chain management, yield optimization,\nfacility management and security. Many cultivation businesses retain outside consultants to advise\non one or more of these issues, although some businesses manage their entire cultivation operations\ninternally. A cultivator may wholesale cannabis flower and other plant material to cannabis concentrate\nmanufacturers or retail dispensaries, or it may be part of a vertically integrated production and retail\nbusiness that sells its flower and other internally manufactured products through its own dispensaries.\n\nCertain U.S. laws, foreign laws and international treaties currently restrict interstate and some\ninternational movement of cannabis products. A cultivation business that wishes to scale its operations\ninto a new jurisdiction often must invest significant capital in a new cultivation facility located within\nthe new jurisdiction. As laws change to allow more interstate and international transportation of can-\nnabis products, cultivators who are operating redundant facilities or expensive indoor facilities will face\nincreased margin pressure. As the cannabis industry matures and becomes more commoditized, we\nexpect the most successful cultivators will be those with strong consumer brands or scalable low-cost\noperations in regions where the climate is conducive to agricultural production.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 35\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024671",
