  "text": "Summary\n\n\"Global growth\nis showing\nbroad-based\nsigns of\nimprovement.\"\n\n2 UBS\n\nEconomy\n\nGlobal growth is showing broad-based signs of improvement, supported by decisive\nmonetary policy from the world's major central banks. In the US, the housing market\nrecovery continues and the labor market remains on a modest uptrend. This has helped\nimprove the sentiment of US consumers, and consumption remains the most important\ncontributor to US GDP growth. Growth has also begun to pick up in key areas of the\nemerging markets, including China and Brazil. While the Eurozone economy remains weak,\nwe expect Q3 2012 to mark the bottom, and that growth will begin to get \"less bad\" from\nQ4 2012.\n\nEquities\n\nEquity markets have been supported by central bank action and the recent improvements\nin economic data. Our preferred markets remain the US and Emerging Markets (EM).\nInvestor funds have started to flow back into EM, as economic data is improving and\ninflation remains under control. Canada and Australia remain our least favored regions\ndue to falling earnings.\n\nFixed Income\n\nUS high yield bonds remain supported by strong corporate fundamentals, modest\neconomic growth, and the broad demand for yield-generating assets. Given this, we see\npotential for further spread tightening. Meanwhile, benchmark rates are expected to rise\ngradually on better economic data, while short rates remain ultra-low. While investment\ngrade corporate bond spreads are approximately fair value, we continue to view their\nabsolute yields as attractive.\n\nCommodities\n\nWe keep a neutral stance on commodities. Increased global liquidity has pushed prices up\nover the last few months, however, for a more sustained price increase we likely need to\nsee further evidence of an acceleration in global growth.\n\nForeign Exchange\n\nWe remain underweight the Japanese yen. The Japanese economy continues to weaken\nagainst its peers, leading to rising pressure for the Bank of Japan to engage in further\nquantitative easing. We have closed our preference for the Canadian dollar following its\nrecent strength, and therefore close our offsetting short CHF position.\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025250",
