  "text": "sales and marketing becomes more efficient as commercial campaigns only need to target those\nphysicians seeing specific subsets of patients;\n\nRegulatory Authorities evaluate the risk-benefit of new therapeutics on specific subgroups of\npatients that are known to be suffering from a specific sub-type of diseases, and can thus\nrequire fewer patients and shorter timelines in clinical programs, ultimately lowering the risks\nand costs of the approval pathway for developers of new therapeutics; and\n\nInvestors can expect to see improving returns as the risk/reward equation of drug\ndevelopment is shifted significantly as a result of shortened timelines, smaller clinical trials,\nimproved probabilities of success, and reduced risks at the clinical, regulatory, and commercial\nlevels.\n\nSecond, the biopharmaceuticals sector is an improving regulatory environment in the U.S.,\nhelping set the stage for a positive investment cycle. There is strong evidence that over the last\ndecade the FDA has been working to improve the drug approval process in the U.S. in tangible\nways that benefit biopharmaceutical companies and reduce the risk for their investors.\nAlthough the path to regulatory approval for product programs has not been made easy by any\nstandard, the FDA has made strides in making the process more predictable and streamlined.\nSome of the most significant improvements have been in therapeutic areas where there is a high\nlevel of unmet medical need. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is\ndemonstrating clear interest in working more constructively with industry to bring new safe\nand effective therapeutics to market that target diseases that have potentially large cost burdens\non the healthcare system (e.g., oncology). Additionally, the FDA has also improved the way\nthat they communicate and interact with sponsors of new products, by creating set\nadministrative procedures and timelines that they are required to meet through legislation like\nthe Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) and the FDA Modernization Act. The FDA has\nimplemented other initiatives that attempt to clarify requirements and shorten regulatory\ntimelines for certain types of therapeutic products that they view as highest priority. These\ninitiatives include programs to grant special designations, including Breakthrough Therapy,\nAccelerated Approval, and Priority Review, which can cut significant time out of the standard\napproval process. The impact of these and other programs has become apparent in the number\nof new drug approvals (“NDAs”) by FDA in both 2011 (0 NDAs) and 2012 (39 NDAs), which\ntrended higher compared to the previous six years and versus historic averages.” Overall,\nthese initiatives and others, both in the U.S. and in other markets (e.g., E.U. and Japan), have\nmade the regulatory environment more favorable for investors in the biopharmaceutical sector,\nand have reduced some of the uncertainty in a critical part of drug development.\n\nA third factor supporting the positive investment thesis in biopharmaceuticals is the interplay\nof favorable conditions in the capital markets and the strategic needs of the large and mid-sized\ncompanies in the sector. These dynamics should create a positive financing and exit\nenvironment for biopharmaceutical companies for the foreseeable future, and the Fund\nManager expect them to contribute to improving venture returns. The aforementioned\ncontraction in the number of active firms and capital flows into healthcare technology venture\nfunds has significantly reduced the level of competition between firms. At the same time, large\nand mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies have become increasingly dependent on\n\n78 Food and Drug Administration.
