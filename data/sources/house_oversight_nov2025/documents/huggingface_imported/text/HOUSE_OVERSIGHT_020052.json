  "text": "Republic Airport in Farmingdale, Long Island. Accompanying Hannity was a small group\nof current and former Fox employees, all Ailes and Trump partisans. But each felt some\nopen angst, or even incredulity, about Trump being Trump: first there was the difficulty of\ngrasping the Comey rationale, and now his failure to give even a nod to his late friend\nAiles.\n\n“He’s an idiot, obviously,” said the former Fox correspondent Liz Trotta.\n\nFox anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle spent much of the flight debating Trump’s entreaties to\nhave her replace Sean Spicer at the White House. “There are a lot of issues, including\npersonal survival.”\n\nAs for Hannity himself, his view of the right-wing world was shifting from Foxcentric\nto Trumpcentric. He did not think much more than a year would pass before he, too,\nwould be pushed from the network, or find it too inhospitable to stay on. And yet he was\npained by Trump’s slavish attentions to Murdoch, who had not only ousted Ailes but\nwhose conservatism was at best utilitarian. “He was for Hillary!” said Hannity.\n\nRuminating out loud, Hannity said he would leave the network and go work full time\nfor Trump, because nothing was more important than that Trump succeed—“in spite of\nhimself,” Hannity added, laughing.\n\nBut he was pissed off that Trump hadn’t called Beth. “Mueller,” he concluded, drawing\ndeeply on an electronic cigarette, had distracted him.\n\nTrump may be a Frankenstein creation, but he was the right wing’s creation, the first,\ntrue, right-wing original. Hannity could look past the Comey disaster. And Jared. And the\nmess in the White House.\n\nStill, he hadn’t called Beth.\n“What the fuck is wrong with him?” asked Hannity.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nTrump believed he was one win away from turning everything around. Or, perhaps more\nto the point, one win away from good press that would turn everything around. The fact\nthat he had largely squandered his first hundred days—whose victories should have been\nthe currency of the next hundred days—was immaterial. You could be down in the media\none day and then the next have a hit that made you a success.\n\n“Big things, we need big things,” he said, angrily and often. “This isn’t big. I need big.\nBring me big. Do you even know what big 1s?”\n\nRepeal and replace, infrastructure, true tax reform—the rollout Trump had promised\nand then depended on Paul Ryan to deliver—was effectively in tatters. Every senior staff\n\nmember was now maintaining that they shouldn’t have done health care, the precursor to\nthe legislative rollout, in the first place. Whose idea was that, anyway?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020052",
