See, eg. id. 1420 (claiming\nthat in January 1999 Princess Haifa made\npayments to Al-Bayoumi, a Defendant al-\nleged to have paid rent on behalf of two of\nthe hijackers). Finally, Plaintiffs allege\nthat members of the Saudi Royal family\nprovided support to al Qaeda in their offi-\ncial capacities as members of the Supreme\nCouncil of Islamic Affairs. Federal Com-\nplaint 19 426464.\n\n4. National Commercial Bank\n\nNCB was established in 1950 by Salim\nbin Mahfouz, the father of Defendant\nKhalid bin Mahfouz, as the first commer-\ncial bank of Saudi Arabia. Ashton Com-\nplaint 1563; Burnett Complaint 188. The\nAshton Plaintiffs allege that the bin Mah-\nfouz family controlled NCB until 1999\nwhen the Saudi government bought a ma-\njority of its shares. Ashton Complaint\n1573.21 The Ashton and Burnett Plaintiffs\nclaim that NCB has a wholly-owned sub-\nsidiary in New York, SNCB Securities,\nLtd., through which it operates an interna-\ntional banking business. Ashton Com-\nplaint 1563; Burnett Complaint 1 88.\n\nPlaintiffs claim Osama bin Laden and al\nQaeda used NCB as “a financial arm, oper-\nating as a financial conduit for [their] oper-\nations.” Ashton Complaint 1564; Burnett\nComplaint 189. In 1986, Khalid bin Mah-\nfouz became NCB’s President and CEO\nand remained so until 1999. Ashton Com-\nplaint 1563; Burnett Complaint 188.\nAlso in 1986, Khalid bin Mahfouz became\nthe Chief Operating Officer and a major\nshareholder of the Bank of Credit and\nCommerce International ““BCCI’). Ash-\nton Complaint 11564, 566; Burnett Com-\n\n21. The Ashton Plaintiffs moved to amend this\nallegation to claim that the Public Investment\nFund (“PIF”), not the Saudi government, pur-\nchased a majority of NCB shares in 1999.\nAshton Docket ## 137, 138.\n\nplaint 11.89, 91. He was subsequently in-\ndicted in New York state in connection\nwith his involvement in BCCI’s fraudulent\npractices, which also implicated NCB. Ash-\nton Complaint 11564, 566; Burnett Com-\nplaint 1189, 91.\n\nPlaintiffs claim both NCB and BCCI\nsupported international terrorism. Ashton\nComplaint 19 564-68; Burnett Complaint\n1791-93. Specifically, a “1999 United\nStates Senate Report on the BCCI scheme\ndetailed the role of [NCB] in hiding assets,\nmoney laundering, the cover-up and ob-\nstruction of a Senate investigation, and\nsponsoring international terrorism.” Bur-\nnett Complaint 189. Additionally, a 1998\nNCB bank audit revealed irregularities in-\nvolving direct donations to several chari-\nties and that $74 million had been funneled\nby the bank’s Zakat Committee to IIRO.”\nAshton Complaint 9569-71; Burnett\n19 94, 95. NCB also allegedly made loans\nto charitable organizations without the\nknowledge of the Zakat Committee. Jd.\nPlaintiffs allege “direct donations were re-\nceived through NCB facilities to the Red\nCrescent Committee, [IIRO], and the Mu-\nwaffaq Foundation,” all Defendants in\nthese actions. Ashton Complaint 4570;\nBurnett Complaint 195. Muwaffaq alleg-\nedly provided Osama bin Laden with $3\nmillion in 1998. Ashton Complaint 1573.\nPlaintiffs claim NCB knew or should have\nknown it was materially supporting al Qae-\nda, Osama bin Laden, and international\nterrorism. Ashton Complaint 1570; Bur-\nnett Complaint 1 95.\n\nC. Defendants’ Status as\nStates for FSIA Purposes\n\nThe Court must first determine if the\nmoving Defendants are “foreign states” for\n\nForeign\n\n22. Zakat is required almsgiving by all Mus-\nlims. See, e.g., Burnett Complaint at 275; id.\n140.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017852",
