  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nThe jury at the second trial, having heard our new scientific evidence, acquitted Murphy of\nmurder. They believed neither the burking nor the cocktail theory. The more like cause of death,\nthey concluded, was a self-administered overdose of heroin. Murphy now lives in California,\nwhere she runs an art gallery.\n\neven though there was little other evidence of Binion's state of mind before his death. But\nif the statement was relevant to show Binion's state of mind at the time he made the\nstatement, the exception still does not allow the statement to be used as evidence of the\nintent or conduct of anyone else-in this case, Murphy. The district court did not give a\nlimiting instruction advising the jury that the statement was only admissible for the limited\npurpose of showing Binion's state of mind.”\n\n19]\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017278",
