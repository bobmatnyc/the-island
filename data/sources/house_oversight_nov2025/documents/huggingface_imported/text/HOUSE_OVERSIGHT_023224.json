( note : I'm confident that both\nthe debt , and the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining\nroom ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that\nI am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are\nimplemented . you may recall that you appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that 1 would go\nback on my word\" I said no , of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that\nwhen amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay ,.\n\nFrom day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed .\nthough this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was\nnever told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were\ndiscussed (ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a\ndetailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon\nwas not forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement\nwarranted a discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one\ntime in three years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and\nlets say he made a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a\nlarge amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was\nknown . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times ,_a detailed\nexecution plan was provided . then and only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a\nnumber of conversations with brad karp that only 20m would be paid , (and even that was more than\noriginally contemplated ) for both transactions . I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of\nour prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp\nsit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of\ncourse. Ifthe transactions were never consummated , 1 would not be owed a dime, however , the price\nwas known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the price that had\nbeen requested before the transaction was begun, and had Iready heavily discounted, out of friendship,\nfrom our agreement . I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly left me felling quite uneasy.\n\nsince you asked since last nov. ifound 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in\neileens drawer. . went through cash flows for phaidon shwoing that john murphy is not an accountant.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023224",
