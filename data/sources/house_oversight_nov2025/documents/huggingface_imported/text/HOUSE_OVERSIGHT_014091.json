Cassell, by through their undersigned\nattorneys, move to compel production of documents relevant to this action that defendant Alan\nM. Dershowitz has refused to produce.\n\nDershowitz has told numerous media sources that he has collected documents that\nprovide “absolute proof” that he has not sexually abused a minor woman known as “Jane Doe\nNo. 3.” And yet despite having received a valid discovery request for these and other related\ndocuments more than 45 days ago, Dershowitz has refused to produce these documents to\nEdwards and Cassell. Indeed, he has refused to produce any documents to them. Accordingly,\nthe Court should direct Dershowitz to produce these materials forthwith, as well as order him to\npay reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees necessitated by his refusal to make any appropriate\n\ndocument production.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014091",
