  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\ninvoluntary. Again the state sought review by the Supreme Court. This time their petition was\ndenied, and Doody’s conviction was finally and definitively reversed.\n\nThe state of Arizona is now planning to retry him without using his false confession. Bail has\nbeen set at $5million, which his, of course, impossible for the Doody family, which has no money,\nto raise.\n\nIf justice delayed is justice denied, then Jonathan Doody has surely been denied justice. The\nthorough decisions of the United States Court of Appeals have all been in his favor, but he\n\nremains in jail for a crime of which he is now presumed innocent and which he may not have\ncommitted.\n\n201\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017288",
