They’re lying.\nQuestion: They show letters in which they offered to depose you.\nAnswer: And they didn’t show my letters in response saying, (a), if you ask me about\nmy legal relationship with Epstein and I’ll be happy to answer. . . . And I responded\nthat I would be happy to be deposed if you could give me any indication that I would\nbe a relevant witness .... They will be proved — all of them [i.e., Cassell, Edwards,\nand Ms. Giuffre] — to be categorically lying and making up this story. And it will bea\nterrible thing for rape victims. ... We [Epstein and Dershowitz] had an academic\nrelationship. I was never in the presence of a single, young, underaged\nwoman. When I was with him, it was with prominent scientists, prominent\nacademics. And they’re just — again — lying about this. I never saw him doing\nanything improper. I was not a participant. I was not a witness.\n\nToday Show, Jan. 22, 2015 (emphases added).\n\nAs another example, in Miami Herald, Dershowitz called the Joinder Motion that he\nseeks to have sealed “the sleaziest /egal document1 have ever seen. They [Edwards and\nCassell] manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested in money. This is a\ndisbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred. They will rue the day they ever made this false\n\ncharge against me” — i.e., Edwards and Cassell will “rue the day” they ever filed the Joinder\n\nMotion. Miami Herald (Jan. 3, 2015).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010771",
