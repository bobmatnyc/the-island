The photographer wanted the photo to be published but many publishers refused and she only managed to do so\nin 1991. The book was titled ‘Living With the Enemy’ and chronicled events of domestic violence. Thanks to Donna’s\n\nefforts, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.\n\n#5 Behind The Counter\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020670",
