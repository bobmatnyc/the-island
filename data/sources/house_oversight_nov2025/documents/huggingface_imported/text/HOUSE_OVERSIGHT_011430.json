I submit if you review\n\nthat, you will see the reason why that it should come into\n\nevidence. But regardless of the hearsay issue and the business\n\nrecords exception, again, as you said in your June 20th\n\norder, the point of defendant's knowledge at the time she mad\n\na defamatory statement is very significant in this case, so if\n\nshe knew ven if she didn't believe my client, if she knew\nthat there had been a number of other under-age minors that\nwere abused in this circumstance, to call my client a liar in\n\nthe face of all that knowledge is something the jury should be\n\nable to consider. So that is a piece that is important and\n\nrelevant to this case. And you can always give a cautionary\n\ninstruction. If you're concerned at any level, as you know,\n\nyou could add a cautionary instruction with respect to the\n\npolice report. But we should be entitled to ask her questions\n\non the stand when she's under oath about what she knew with\n\nrespect to this very significant document.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011430",
