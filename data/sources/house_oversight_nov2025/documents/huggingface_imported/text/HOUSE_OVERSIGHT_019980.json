  "text": "In nearby Alexandria, Virginia, Richard Spencer, the president of the National Policy\nInstitute, which is sometimes described as a “white supremacist think tank,” who had,\npeskily for the White House, adopted the Trump presidency as a personal victory, was\norganizing his trip to CPAC, which would be as much a victory march for him as it was\nfor the Trump team. Spencer—who, in 2016, he had declared, “Let’s party like it’s 1933,”\nas in the year Hitler came to power—provoked an outcry with his widely covered “Heil\nTrump” (or “Hail Trump,” which of course amounts to the same thing) salute after the\nelection, and then achieved a kind of reverse martyrdom by taking a punch from a\nprotester on Inauguration Day that was memorialized on YouTube.\n\nCPAC, organized by the remnants of the conservative movement after Barry\nGoldwater’s apocalyptic defeat in 1964, had, with stoic indefatigability, turned itself into\nthe backbone of conservative survival and triumph. It had purged John Birchers and the\nracist right and embraced the philosophic conservative tenets of Russell Kirk and William\nF. Buckley. In time, it endorsed Reagan-era small government and antiregulatory reform,\nand then added the components of the cultural wars—antiabortion, anti-gay-marriage, and\na tilt toward evangelicals—and married itself to conservative media, first right-wing radio\nand later Fox News. From this agglomeration it spun an ever more elaborate and all-\nembracing argument of conservative purity, synchronicity, and intellectual weight. Part of\nthe fun of a CPAC conference, which attracted a wide assortment of conservative young\npeople (reliably mocked as the Alex P. Keaton crowd by the growing throng of liberal\npress that covered the conference), was the learning of the conservative catechism.\n\nBut after a great Clinton surge in the 1990s, CPAC started to splinter during the George\nW. Bush years. Fox News became the emotional center of American conservativism. Bush\nneocons and the Iraq War were increasingly rejected by the libertarians and other suddenly\nbreakaway factions (among them the paleocons); the family values right, meanwhile, was\nmore and more challenged by younger conservatives. In the Obama years, the\nconservative movement was increasingly bewildered by Tea Party rejectionism and a new\niconoclastic right-wing media, exemplified by Breitbart News, which was pointedly\nexcluded from the CPAC conference.\n\nIn 2011, professing conservative fealty, Trump lobbied the group for a speaking slot\nand, with reports of a substantial cash contribution, was awarded a fifteen-minute berth. If\nCPAC was supposedly about honing a certain sort of conservative party line, it was also\nattentive to a wide variety of conservative celebrities, including, over the years, Rush\nLimbaugh, Ann Coulter, and various Fox News stars. The year before Obama’s reelection,\nTrump fell into this category. But he was viewed quite differently four years later. In the\nwinter of 2016, during the still competitive Republican primary race, Trump—now eyed\nas much as a Republican apostate as a Republican crowd pleaser—decided to forgo CPAC\nand what he feared would be less than a joyous welcome.\n\nThis year, as part of its new alignment with the Trump-Bannon White House, CPAC’s\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019980",
