  "text": "beginning I kept having this nagging\nthought: what is so bad about getting\nbetter from a placebo?”\n\nThat kind of thinking, still hard for\nmost doctors to accept, was heretical in\n1990, when Kaptchuk arrived at Har-\nvard. “People kept saying, ‘Oh, this is just\nthe placebo effect” You would hear that\nevery day,” Kaptchuk said. He had spent\nyears studying Chinese medicine (and\nmedical history), and this made no sense\nto him. “I thought, Ted, step back a\nminute. This wasn’t just something that\nwas a negative. It was something that\nneeded to be understood.”\n\nSlowly, over the past decade, re-\nsearchers have begun to tease out the\nstrands of the placebo response. The\nfindings, while difficult to translate into\nmedicine, have been compelling. In most\ncases, the larger the pill, the stronger the\nplacebo effect. Two pills are better than\none, and brand-name pills trump gener-\nics. Capsules are generally more effective\nthan pills, and injections produce a more\npronounced effect than either. There is\neven evidence to suggest that the color of\nmedicine influences the way one re-\nsponds to it: colored pills are more likely\nto relieve pain than white pills; blue pills\nhelp people sleep better than red pills;\nand green capsules are the best bet when\nit comes to anxiety medication.\n\nConditioning and expectations mat-\nter, and so does learned behavior. In the\neighties, Levine and Gordon divided a\ngroup of postoperative patients into three\nsections: those in the first section re-\nceived morphine secretly, those in the\nsecond were told they would receive\nmorphine (and did), and those in the\nthird were given a placebo that was de-\nscribed as a powerful pain reliever. The\nresults were startling. Patients who were\ntold that they would receive a painkiller,\nwhether they actually received it or not,\nhad the same experience in the trial as\nthose who secretly received between six\nand eight milligrams of morphine—a\nsignificant amount. The covert dose had\nto be increased to twelve milligrams to\nsurpass the effect of the placebo. Over\nthe past two decades, the Italian neuro-\nscientist Fabrizio Benedetti (who studied\nwith Gordon and Levine), and Luana\nColloca, a colleague of Benedetti’s, who\nis now based in the United States, at\nthe National Institutes of Health, have\nexpanded on these studies. They have\n\nfound, for example, that diazepam—\nmore commonly known as Valium—has\nno discernible effect on anxiety unless a\nperson knows he is taking it. And, in-\ncreasingly, studies like those have been\ncarried out with the help of imaging\ntechniques—such as PET scans and func-\ntional M.R.I.s—that can track brain\nchanges as they happen. These advances\nin brain imaging, along with an increased\nunderstanding of neurochemicals, have\ntransformed a vague and mysterious no-\ntion into a tangible effect that scientists\nconsider worthy of investigation.\n\n“What's exciting here is that, ifwe are\nto talk about using placebos in a clinical\nsetting, they would have to have a mea-\nsurable effect and a biology we under-\nstand,” Wayne Jonas told me. Jonas is an\ninteresting hybrid in a world often\nsharply divided between conventional\nand alternative therapies. In the early\nnineties, he served as the director of the\nMedical Research Fellowship Program\nat the Walter Reed Army Institute of\nResearch, in Washington, D.C. He went\non to run the Office of Alternative Med-\nicine at the National Institutes of Health,\nfrom 1995 to 1999. Today, Jonas is the\npresident of the Samueli Institute, a\nWashington research group devoted to\nshifting the focus of health care from\ntreatment to prevention.\n\n“The morphine studies bring us a long\nway,” he said. So did a recent investiga-\ntion by Kaptchuk, in which participants\n\nsuffering from irritable-bowel syndrome\nwere not deceived about their treatment;\nin fact, they were told in great detail about\nthe placebos they received and that they\nwere often as effective as real medicine.\nThe pills brought them relief.\n\nFor many people in the field, results\nlike those achieved in the morphine and\nI.B.S. studies, while preliminary and in\nneed of confirmation, hint at something\nfar more significant than the effect of a\nplacebo or problems with a particular\ndrug. They suggest that the “magic bullet”\napproach to health care—simple, effective\nsolutions to single problems, like a strep\ninfection or polio—can no longer remain\nour principal approach to treating disease.\n\nThere has always been a distinction\nbetween disease and illness. Disease is a\nbiological condition that we have histor-\nically treated with drugs, surgery, and\nother technological solutions. Illness, on\nthe other hand, defines the context of a\nmedical encounter, including the rela-\ntionship between doctor and patient.\nLike Kaptchuk, Jonas believes that pla-\ncebo research demonstrates that it is es-\nsential to consider both the science and\nthe art of medicine—to think about dis-\neases as illnesses, and not to rely solely on\nshort-term, high-tech solutions. Scien-\ntists hope that, even if it proves impossi-\nble to replace drugs with placebos, re-\nsearch into the way they affect us will\naccomplish nothing less than a transfor-\nmation of American medicine. “There are\n\n“Bore me to sleep, Daddy.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029928",
