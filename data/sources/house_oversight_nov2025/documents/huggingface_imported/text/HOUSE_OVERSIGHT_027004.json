This idea is quite similar to (and\nlikely inspired by) Henry Markram’s Blue Brain project in\nLausanne, which recently won a 1.5Bn grant from the European\nUnion. While this is an interesting project in its own right, it\nwill not address the key question of cognitive science:\nWhat is the mind? What are the building blocks and\nfundamental operations of thinking and perception?\nHere, I would like to suggest the instigation of a project that is\nat once more ambitious, more narrowly targeted, and likely to\nyield more profound theoretical, practical and cultural insights\nthan the Brain Activity Mapping initiative: The study of the\ncomputational structure of mental representation.\nMental representation, not\nneurons will inform the\ncore our understanding of\ncognition.\nCognition is incidentally enabled by human nervous systems,\nbut in its nature, it is not a chemical, biological or physiological\nphenomenon. Instead, cognitive systems are a class of\ninformation processing systems, thinking is a set of certain,\nfunctionally identifiable operations, over certain, functionally\nidentifiable types of representations, and with respect to a set\nof problems and properties given by certain environments.\nThus, the Structure of Mental Representation initiative should\nfocus on mental content, with all its dynamic, relational,\nconceptual, and linguistic elements, and it’s grounding in\nperception and interaction.\n2\nThe study of mental\nrepresentations requires a\nnew scientific discipline\nIntegrating concepts from\nlinguistics, cognitive\npsychology and\nneuroscience within the\nmethodological framework\nof constructionist Artificial\nIntelligence\nA new common ground\nbetween AI and cognitive\nscience researchers\nUnraveling mental representations will be an interdisciplinary\neffort among several cognitive sciences, but distinct from the\ndisciplines that we find now:\nThe project will differ from linguistics, for instance, in similar\nway as geography differs from plate tectonics. Where linguists\nstudy the intrinsic ‘geography’ of languages, and the structural\ncommonalities among them, mental representations uncover\nthe underlying dynamics that produce natural languages (as\nthe solutions to the problem of translating between\nhierarchical, distributed, associative, ambiguous\nrepresentations and the discrete strings of symbols that we use\nas a means of exchanging and organizing ideas).\nMental representations lie outside the domain of neuroscience,\nwhich mostly focuses on material descriptions of the function\nof the underlying substrate. They cannot be studied well within\ncontemporary psychology, which favors an experimentalist,\nquantitative approach, where we need to address qualitative\nquestions by constructing working, implementable systems.\nAnd needless to say, the study of mental representations is\ncurrently not well represented in Artificial Intelligence\nresearch, which does provide a productive methodology, but\nhas mostly turned towards applications and narrow AI\nsolutions.\nDespite the lack of a common methodological ground between\nthe cognitive sciences, we can now observe a growing\nconsensus on how to approach the problem of modeling the\nmind, and its representational apparatus. During the last\ndecade, a number of initiatives have sprung up within AI,\npsychology and cognitive science, each with journals,\nworkshops and conference series, and a large personal overlap\namong each community. Examples include Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures\n(BICA), Cognitive Systems, and Cognitive Modeling (ICCM).\nAmong those groups, there is an emerging consensus on\nseveral paradigms:\n-­‐\n-­‐\n-­‐\nIntegrated architectures of cognition. We need to study\nwhole, working systems, both for the purpose of\ncomparison between approaches, but mainly, because\ncognition is not the product of the activity of individual\nmodular functions, but of the interaction between them.\nUniversal representations. Representations must provide\nboth distributed and localist aspects, to enable neural\nlearning, information retrieval via spreading activation, as\nwell as symbolic processing (language and planning).\nPerceptual grounding. Representations should be\ngrounded in an environmental interaction context, using a\nbottom-­‐up/top-­‐down perception paradigm, to allow for\n3\nopen-­‐ended autonomous learning and language\nacquisition.\n-­‐\n-­‐\n-­‐\n-­‐\n-­‐\nIntegration of perception and action. Environmental\ninteraction is (at least partially) a control process that\nrequires a modeling of the relationship between sensory\ndata and operations performed by the system.\n(Semi-­‐) Universal problem solving, enabling paradigms\nof learning, planning, reasoning, analogies, language\nacquisition and reflection.\nA structured memory, including provisions for a\nworld/situation model, a protocol of environmental\ninteractions, procedural memory, declarative and\ntypological abstractions, a model of self, and a 'mental\nstage', to facilitate anticipation and planning.\nDecision making and motivational mechanisms, to\naddress both autonomous, goal-­‐directed cognition in\ncomplex, open domains, and the genesis of goals and\nintentions.\nThe direction and modulation of attention, and the\nemergence of emotion and affect, which are\nconfigurational aspects of cognition that either reflect the\nallocation of cognitive resources, or structure social\ninteraction.\nConstraints for Mental Representations\nBased on the emergent paradigm of a new generation of\ncognitive architectures, we can think about mental\nrepresentations in a new and productive way. More specifically,\nwe know that mental representations include perceptual and\npropositional/conceptual content and we are aware of many\nconstraints. Mental representations must\n-­‐\n-­‐\n-­‐\n-­‐\n-­‐\n-­‐\nOffer support for both connectionist and symbolic\nprocessing (including compositionality and grammatical\nstructures), with the latter one being a special case of the\nformer\nPossess a hierarchical structure, bottoming out in\nsensory perception\nCover prototypes, individuals and abstractions\nInclude perceptual and relational features, objects,\nsituations, and episodic knowledge\nAllow simulation of dynamic processes\nSolve the bridge problem between fuzzy associative\nhierarchies and the discrete symbol strings of natural\nlanguage\n4\nCreating a scientific community\nOperations on these representations include reinforcement\nlearning and classification, perceptual top-­‐down/bottom-­‐up\nprocessing, abstraction, analogy formation, associative and\nsyllogistic reasoning, planning, reflection, anticipation and\nseveral modes of reorganization.\nThe task of the Structure of Mental Representation initiative will\nat first consist in the creation of a large and competitive\ncommunity, built around a set of benchmark problems.\nI suggest picking a set of problems that covers most of the\nabove architectural requirements: the comprehension of\ndynamic visual sequences (movies) and narratives. The\nevaluation of comprehension may focus both on a discourse\nlevel (asking the system general and specific questions about\nthe consumed visuals or narratives) and directly, by producing\ndynamic renderings and depictions of knowledge represented\nwithin the system. At least on the discourse level, a direct\ncomparison to the functional properties of child performance\nat different cognitive stages is possible.\nThe Comprehension\nChallenge\nTurning the benchmark task into a regular competition allows a\ndirect comparison between models, and offers a strong\nincentive for exchange of solutions among research groups. The\nneed to for broad solutions with given material and intellectual\nresources will enforce a higher degree of the reuse of code and\nideas than we currently see in AI architectures (outside of\nrobotic soccer, where such competitions have turned out to be\nhighly successful).\nThe Formation of a Pilot Team\nBy structuring the comprehension tasks into different levels\nand sub-­‐domains (such as basic language acquisition tasks,\ngrammar, perceptual and logical tasks, social reasoning/theory\nof mind, affective evaluation, constructive problem solving, use\nof analogies and metaphor etc.), we can formulate consistent\nlong-­‐term goals and realistic short-­‐term problems.\nTo pull the Structure of Mental Representation initiative off the\nground, we will need to create a pilot team, which is the object\nof this proposal. The pilot team has the following tasks:\n-­‐\n-­‐\n-­‐\nBring a critically sized group of people together, with a\nwell-­‐defined set of shared goals\nFormulate an initial set of hypotheses\nBring these in the context of an existing or hypothetical\ncognitive architecture, so specifications can be derived\n5\n-­‐\nBuild an initial software infrastructure for testing\nbenchmark problems, and to create a common\nmethodological ground\nComposition of a pilot\nteam\nThe pilot team should consist of a scientific board, including a\nmutually compatible sub-­‐set of contemporary thinkers in the\nfield. Its core should consist of a new generation of researchers\nthat have the resources and impetus to work full-­‐time on the\ndesign, implementation and publication of the project’s\ninfrastructure. The initial team size should not be large, but\nagile and effective (I would suggest about five permanent\nresearchers, about the same number of dedicated software\ndevelopers, and 2–3 slots for visiting scientists at a time).\nThe initial duration should be about 2.5 years, followed be an\nevaluation, and a possible continuation of similar length.\nPossible candidates for the scientific board include (in no\nparticular order) Paul Rosenbloom (who worked with Alan\nNewell on the cognitive architecture Soar, and now started a\nnew architecture), John Sowa (well-­‐known for his\ngroundbreaking work in semantic networks), Ben Goertzel\n(designer of the cognitive architecture OpenCog), Luc Steels (an\nAI researcher studying the emergence of natural language in\ncommunities of software agents), Jerome Feldman (who\ndevised building blocks for a Neural Theory of Language),\nStephen Pinker (who thought much about the relationship\nbetween language and mental representation), Stephen\nKosslyn (an expert on the psychology of mental\nrepresentation), Daniel Dennet, Cristiano Castelfranchi (an AI\nresearcher specializing on mental representations of intentions\nand social context), and many others.\nThe project should start out with a number of kickoff\nmeetings to invite the interaction between suitable candidates,\nand the formation of a core group. The eventual pilot team\ncould be located in many possible places, however, the project\nshould be able to draw on the vicinity of academic and other\ninfrastructure, and the influence of a creative environment.\nAbout me (Joscha Bach):\nDriven by an interest to learn hot the mind works, I studied philosophy\nand psychology, graduated in computer science/artificial intelligence, lead\nseveral small academic research groups, built the cognitive architecture\nMicroPsi and obtained a PhD in cognitive science. I co-­‐founded a couple of\nstartup companies in Berlin, but turned back towards academia to\ncontribute to the question of how to build a mind.",
