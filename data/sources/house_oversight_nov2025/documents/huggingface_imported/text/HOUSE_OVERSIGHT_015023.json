Certain of\nthe people deeply involved in these manipulations thought it was kismet that an individual well-suited\nto head the newly ordained Department of Homeland Security (that as we all know was the result of\nlegislation rushed through Congress in the aftermath of the 9/11 (2001) attack) was born on the\nmagical September 11th (this is Jeh Johnson); similarly, it is again being deemed a sign that the new\nDirector of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (chosen and positioned as she was) is first-\nnamed France (last name Cordova) and that this name so perfectly relates to US intentions to use\nthe NSF to forward \"ops\" that will solidify a US-France working relationship in the same way the\n2005 London Bombings helped solidify the US-British working relationship.

On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights\nand feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously\nand with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary\nInjunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire.\n\n4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against\nwhom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's\nmother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive\nmonetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those\nrelationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011,\nand wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against\nMs. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of\na Temporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011.\n\n- Initial Complaint, 5/11/11, McGuire v.
