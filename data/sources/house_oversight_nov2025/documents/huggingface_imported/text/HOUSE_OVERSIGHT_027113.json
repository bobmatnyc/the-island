But\nHamas is afraid to fall into the same trap that others, like Fatah, have\nfallen into without getting anything in return except loss of popular\nsupport, as was demonstrated in the elections seven years ago. In light of\nthe demands that the movement should recognize the two-state solution\nand make political commitments, some influential circles within the\nHamas leadership think that the movement is being drawn into going\nbeyond its rational political discourse and how it deals with the reality on\nthe ground, and into recognizing Israel and exchanging messages with\n\nit.

As Hamas is being smothered, with a few breaches here and there,\nthe demands that it should recognize Israel are ongoing and without letup.\nIn other words, Hamas must choose between recognizing Israel to stay in\npower, or losing what it has achieved democratically as punishment for\nhaving to refused to bow to the world’s conditions.
