  "text": "larges private house in Manhattan. (Rumors will continue for many years, that\nWexner owns the house and Epstein is just squatting in it, paying taxes on it, —an\n18-year squat.) He buys an airplane. He buys another. He expands his holdings in\nNew Mexico. He begins a Zanadu refurbishment of his Caribbean Island.\n\nHe befriends Bill Clinton in his new after-office life.\n\nAnd that’s quite the fatal pairing.\n\nThe post-Monica Clinton, now having pardoned the on-the-lam financier\nMarc Rich—at this point, before his own rehabilitation, Clinton really is the\nworld’s ultimate sleaze ball—is suddenly being ferried around in the jet of...who\nexactly?\n\nThe New York Post is the first to take formal media note of the\nClinton-Epstein connection, hinting at a sex and money bromance. (“I suppose\ntravel with Clinton changed the arc of my life,” Epstein tells me. “There were, I\nknew, lots of obvious reasons not to do it, but having the ability to spend 100 hours\nwith a former president just doesn’t happen to many people.”’)\n\nThe instinctively private Epstein is not just increasingly exposed, but clearly\ncurious about the nature of exposure.\n\nI met Epstein around this time. Epstein had become a more and more active\nbacker of advanced scientific research and in 2002 he was taking a small group of\nscientists out to the TED conference in Monterey. The TED organizers invited\nvarious other TED participants, including me, to join the flight. A small group\nassembled at the private plane terminal, most of us unfamiliar with our benefactor,\nand as we headed in the direction of the discrete private plans we were gently\npointed to our ride: Epstein’s 727.\n\nIt is some thoroughly updated drawing room set-up, all of us nervously\nensconced in this luxury plane, waiting for our unknown host to arrive—and soon\nhe does, tanned, relaxed, with wide open smile, accompanied by three young\nwomen.\n\nIt would be unlikely, outside of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe life,\nthat you could locate this in reality. Epstein’s sincere attentions, taking time with\neach of his passengers, seemed impossible to account for. The quiet of the plane,\nengineered into acoustic perfection, seemed spooky. Epstein’s three companions\nwere witty, poised, helpful as well as powerfully alluring—as though stewardesses\nof bygone times.\n\n(One more thing about this trip: Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey\nBrin, with their company still in its infancy, came out to see the plane on the\nMonterey tarmac and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran whopping from one\nend of the plan to the other. Then they described for Epstein, in what I can not now\nremember as a put on or entrepreneurial brainstorm, a brand extension in which\nthey would market a line of Google bras with the Os as convenient cups.
