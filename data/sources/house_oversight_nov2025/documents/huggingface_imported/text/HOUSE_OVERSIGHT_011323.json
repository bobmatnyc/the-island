No, your Honor. The defendant's own expert report\ndescribed our client as a prostitute. Your Honor has under\nadvisement th xpert report from Dr. Esplin, and so I deposed\n\nDr. Esplin, and I said, \"Are you sure that's an accurate term\n\nin the context of this case? Because we have a child who\n\ncannot consent to sexual activities.\" And he backed off\n\nimmediately and agreed that that was an inaccurate term for him\n\nto use to describe my client, Ms. Giuffre. So even the\ndefense's own expert says the term \"prostitute\" is\ninappropriate.\n\nYour Honor has authority, of course, under Rule 611 to\n\nmanage the trial, to avoid undue harassment or embarrassment.\n\nAlso Rule 403 allows you to restrict things that would be\n\nsubstantially prejudicial with no probative value, which is\n\nexactly what we have here. So we would ask you simply to reign\nin derogatory language, both from witnesses and opposing\ncounsel.\n\nMS. SCHULTZ: Your Honor, I'll be addressing the next\n\nseveral points in the omnibus motion, starting with number 8.\n\nI think I can narrow this issue a little bit at the outset.\n\nMs. Giuffre concedes here that illegal or\nnonprescription use of drugs during the years that she was with\ndefendant is admissible. However, any evidence pertaining to\n\nany use of drugs, illegal or not, and alcohol from any periods\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011323",
