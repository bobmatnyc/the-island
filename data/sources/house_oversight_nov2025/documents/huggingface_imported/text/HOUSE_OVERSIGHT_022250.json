By telling a reporter \"I'm \nan offender\", he seems to be admitting guilt. \nWhich brings me to the big question of the day. Why did Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan D.A., allow a \nLevel 3 sex offender (the most dangerous kind) to reside -- even for ten minutes -- in a house that is right \nnext to Central Park and a school? Isn't that unlawful given the housing guidelines for sex offenders? \nAccording to the NYPost, Epstein's Level 3 designation means that he is at \"high risk\" to repeat his \noffense and poses \"a threat to public safety.\" \nWhen I rang Vance (twice) to discuss Epstein's residential guidelines he did not take my calls. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022250 \nAccording to a few of the attorneys who represented Epstein's victims in the civil cases, the financier \nnever agreed to a psychological evaluation prior to or during his sentence, a requirement of all sexual \npredators. \nWhile Epstein's self-incriminating statements are published (this week he told the Post \"the crime that \nwas supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York\" -- an interesting choice of words -- he \ncontinues to mock the law that applies to all other sex offenders who are found guilty of the same crime. \nEpstein served 13 months in the West Palm Beach Stockade and 18 months under community control (a \nrather permissive version of house arrest), for 2 Counts of Solicitation of Prostitution with a Minor. \nIn August of 2010, immediately following his release from \"community control\", Epstein returned to his \n$50 million East 71st Street town house given to him by his former client and long time friend Leslie \nWexner. \nJust in the last few weeks he held a house warming dinner to celebrate his release from jail and \nreportedly invited television reporters Katie Couric, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulus and his close \nfriend, HRH Prince Andrew, according to the NY Post. \nYou would think these professional television reporters would have done their homework prior to \naccepting his invitation no matter how desperate they were to rub elbows with Prince Andrew. \nAccording to a 53-page sealed indictment Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple counts of \nstatutory rape, and child sex trafficking. \nCourt documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out girls as young as 14 and paid them $200 to \n$1,000 for sexually explicit massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan. \nIn the New York sex-offender database, Epstein isn't registered under a zip code rather a \"name search\" \noption that does not list his New York address. \nThe reason for this is because Epstein's Upper East Side home is considered \"temporary\" and by NY state \nlaw, he is required to provide only his permanent address to the database. \nEpstein is currently listed under his Florida home even though he is no longer a Florida resident either \n(after his arrest he immediately became a US VI resident), but then again who's keeping count? \nOnce again these are mere technicalities when it comes to Epstein's sexual predator case. The two most \ndisturbing parts of this story are that this could easily happen again and that once again there will be no \njustice. \nHad Epstein been a caring benefactor contributing to society and these young girl's education and well \nbeing then the world would have judged him differently. \nWhat he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage to hundreds of underage \ngirls who could have been sponsored towards a better education. \nWith respect to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, I'm confused by his decision to allow this sexual predator to \nlive at his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun \ncontrol as witnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPost when asked about a Florida driver cleared in a \nManhattan weapon's charge, \"guns brought illegally into New York City\" he said, \" for any reason \nviolate well established state laws and are a threat to our public safety\". \nThen wouldn't a registered sex offender living 500 feet from a park (Central Park where young girls \ncongregate), and with resources to spare be an even more dangerous threat to society? \nThe Billionaire Pedophile's Sex Den \nby Conchita Sarnoff javascriptvoid(0) \n• javascript:;javascript:; \n• http://www.thedailybeast.comiblogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billionaire-and-his-sex-dendull/ \n• javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:void(0) \n• Email \n• javascript:void(0) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022251 \nNewscom Hedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who  went free this week, lived in a \ndepraved world of thrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only \nnow being revealed. Conchita Sarnoff reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive \nexposé. Also: \n• Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the bathroom soap was shaped \nlike sex organs \n• Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three massage appointments each \nday \n• The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than Epstein—for trying to sell \nnotes regarding massage appointments \n• Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling agency \nMC2 \n• According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2—often from \nEastern Europe—then traveled on Epstein's private jets \nJeffrey Epstein's loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously \nlenient. They insist that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and \nessentially harmless. As the police records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told \nthey could \"say no\" at any time during a massage as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault \nthat was remarkably similar in every victim's statement: First she would be asked to remove her shirt, \nthen her pants. He would attempt to fondle her buttocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a \nlarge vibrator. There was sometimes digital penetration, and the more willing girls were lured into full-\nblown sexual relations with both Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts \nand police reports as Epstein's live-in \"sex slave.\" \nA former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., \nconfirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein's private jets. \nIt's true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily \nseveral times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of \nthe contact, particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this \ncase—judging by arrangements at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund \nmanager, organized his life around this sexual compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests \nhe felt he was beyond the law. \n• Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe  \n• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free  \nAccording to police who executed a search warrant, the house was decorated with large, framed photos \nof nude young girls, and similar images were found stashed in an armoire and on the computers seized at \nthe house (although police found only bare cables where other computers had been). Some bathrooms \nwere stocked with soap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a \"twin torpedo\" \nvibrator and creams and lubricants available at erotic specialty shops, were stowed near the massage \ntables set up in several rooms upstairs. \nEpstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley \nGroff, and Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated \nthat they would not be charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all \nfour women, among their other duties, worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-\ndaily \"massages\" was stocked with fresh recruits. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late \nCzechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years Epstein's live-in partner, \nalso recruited young girls. \nSince his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a \ndozen lawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days \nbefore a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's \n$2 billion net worth. \nThe victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef \noften gave them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid \nnamed Lupita, who was a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022252 \nmassage sessions, picking up soiled towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo \nof Epstein with the pope hung next to one of him with a young girl. \nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced \nto more jail time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein's activities. He was \nfired, he says, for inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house \nunannounced to collect money. He saw an unfamiliar \"beater\" in the driveway one evening and called \n911. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriguez took away some notes and emails about massage \nappointments as \"protection\" against his own prosecution, and failed to produce them during the Palm \nBeach Police Department's initial investigation. \n• javascript:;javascript:; \n• http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billionaire-and-his-sex-den/full/ \n• javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:void(0) \n• Email \n• javascript:void(0) \nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell \nthis \"golden nugget\"—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he \nmade the offer to an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with \"obstruction of official \nproceedings\" for withholding information that could have advanced the criminal investigation of \nEpstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in \nfederal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach county jail), and now awaits \nan additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms, another deal he \nsays he made to pay the bills after he lost his job. \nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000 \nin cash on hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley \nRobson who brought them to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the \nPalm Beach Police Department, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of \nhis various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, \nin his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to the police department \n(which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department \n$100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchase when Epstein \ncame under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein's local \nattorneys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was \n\"very passionate\" about massages being \"therapeutically and spiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told \npolice they had no massage training.) \nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc \nBrunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and \nMarcinkova \"deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children \nthrough MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.\" (Which would \namount to trafficking.) \nBrunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling \nagency. He lives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices \nin New York, Miami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) \nBrunel has been observed as a house guest at Epstein's Palm Beach home and may well have had contact \nwith him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an \napartment on elegant Ave. Foch. \nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted \nin Michael Gross' book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugly Business pfBeautiful Women. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022253 \nPyes told the author that Brunel \"ranks among the sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking \nabout a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls were not only harassed but molested.\" Now \nThe Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire transfer to Brunel's offshore bank \naccount in September 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan or a \nbackdoor investment in the new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving \nevidence in the Epstein investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked \nin April of Brunel's activities, Epstein said \"I'm 100 percent convinced that he doesn't traffic children.\" \n(Brunel has never been charged.) \nAn American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very \nbeautiful; many were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency's \nMiami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became \nfrequent guests on Epstein's private jets. \nPilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. \nOther times, the pilot would just list the other passengers plus \"female.\" \nPosted 02 August 2010 - 12:47 AM \nJeffrey Epstein, Jew Billionaire Pedophile, Child Trafficker Goes Free..WoW! 20 year old Hearsay is enough to destroy catholic priest.

She is writing a book about child trafficking in \nAmerica. \nHedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived in a depraved world \nof thrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now being revealed. \nConchita Sarnoff follows up on her investigation of the legal wrangling that saved him from a long \nprison term and reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: \n• Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein's \"special treatment\" and gave The Daily Beast an \nexclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation. \n• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have landed \nEpstein in prison for 20 years. \n• Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former \nSoviet republics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift. \n• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be \nevidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was \nconvicted of. \n• Epstein's attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered \nprivate investigators to follow and intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. \n• Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he \"would have instructed the \nJustice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022254 \nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a \nlife of privilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house \narrest in Palm Beach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski's time at a Swiss ski chalet. \nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis \nDuring Epstein's term of \"house arrest,\" he made several trips each month to his New York home and \nhis private Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a \nminor-13 months in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, \nEpstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to \nperform \"massages\" at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, \ndays before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent \nEpstein's $2 billion net worth. \n• Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe \n• The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den \nWith that, the known victims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case \nagainst him is closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving \nassets out of the U.S. and may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile. \nBut the question remains: Did Epstein's wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; \nPrince Andrew; former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and \nformer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private \njets—allow him to receive only a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? \nWas he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, \nRoy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice? \nEpstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe \nhttp://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork  \nThe Justice Department is investigating Jeffrey Epstein for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has \nlearned—and has widened the scope of its probe to include a famous modeling agency. \nHedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last \nweek. But it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that: \n• Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein's activities, to see whether there is evidence of \nchild trafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the \narrangement between Epstein and the Department of Justice allowing him to plead guilty to lower-level \nstate crimes. Trafficking can carry a 20-year sentence. \n• The FBI is also investigating Epstein's friend Jean Luc Brunel, whose MC2 modeling agency appears \nto have been a source of girls from overseas who ended up on Epstein's private jets. \nBecause Epstein's predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, \nthere may well be more evidence to uncover. \nUnder the concept of double jeopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges \ncovered by his non-prosecution agreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of incarceration, \nfund the civil suits of named victims, and register as a sex offender. The victims who accepted cash \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022255 \nsettlements in these civil suits agreed not to testify against him or speak publicly about the case. \nHowever, new evidence developed by the Department of Justice on other offenses not covered by the \nagreement, including allegations by additional victims who come forward, could lead to new charges. \nThere is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-trafficking law, which was also enacted by the state of \nFlorida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-\nlooking girls, there may well be more evidence to uncover. (Several young women who claim to be \nEpstein victims have recently contacted a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer, but to date no new civil complaints \nhave been filed.) \n• Conchita Sarnoff: The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den \n• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free \nThese new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about \nEpstein's pattern of sexual contact with underage girls, which Palm Beach police began investigating in \n2005 and the U.S. Attorney's office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. The first article quoted a deposition \nby then-Palm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter, in which he stated that Epstein, a billionaire with \nmany powerful friends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his \nincarceration. Although federal investigators at one point produced a draft 53-page indictment against \nEpstein, he was eventually allowed to plead guilty to only two relatively minor state charges and receive \na short term of incarceration: 13 months in the county jail, during which he went to the office every day, \nand one year of community control, during which he traveled frequently to New York and his private \nisland in the Virgin Islands. \nThe Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which Epstein apparently received special \nconsideration: As a convicted sex offender, he is required by law to undergo an impartial psychological \nevaluation prior to sentencing and to receive psychiatric treatment during and after incarceration. This is \nbecause child molesters tend to be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According to a source \nin law enforcement, however, Epstein was allowed to submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr. \nStephen Alexander of Palm Beach, Florida, whose phone has since been disconnected with no \nforwarding information. \nThe Daily Beast's second article provided details about Epstein's systematic abuse of underage girls at \nhis Palm Beach mansion, where members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers, \nmost of them 16 or younger, to perform daily massages that devolved into masturbation, groping, and \nsometimes full-blown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between Epstein and Jean \nLuc Brunel, a frequent visitor to whom he gave $1 million around the same time that Brunel was starting \nhis MC2 modeling agency. Some of the young girls MC2 recruited from overseas—often from Eastern \nEurope and South America—are known to have been passengers on Epstein's private jets. \nThe U.S. Attorney General's Office in Florida says that it is against policy to confirm or deny the \nexistence of an investigation. Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer, Jack Goldberger, says he has no knowledge of an \nongoing probe, and he told The Daily Beast, \"Jeffrey Epstein has fully complied with all state and federal \nrequirements that arise from the prior proceedings in Palm Beach. There are no pending civil lawsuits. \nThere are not and should not be any pending criminal investigations, given Mr. Epstein's complete \nfulfillment of all the terms of his non-prosecution agreement with the federal government.\" \nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and \nhas produced three current-events debate TV programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and \na segment for The Oppenheimer Report.
