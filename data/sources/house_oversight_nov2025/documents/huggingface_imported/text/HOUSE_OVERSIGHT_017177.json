From the beginning of my\ncareer as a First Amendment lawyer, I have taken aim at this analogy, both in my writings and in\nmy cases. In my view, it is one of the least persuasive, though most influential, arguments for\ncensorship that ever came from anyone’s pen!\n\nThe case that gave rise to the “Fire!’”’-in-a-crowded-theater analogy— Schenck v. United States—\ninvolved the prosecution of Charles Schenck, who was the general secretary of the Socialist Party\nin Philadelphia. In 1917 a jury found Schenck guilty of attempting to cause insubordination\namong soldiers who had been drafted to fight in the First World War. He had circulated leaflets\nurging draftees not to “submit to intimidation” by fighting in a war being conducted on behalf of\n“Wall Street’s chosen few.” Schenck admitted that the intent of the pamphlet’s “impassioned\nlanguage” was to “influence” draftees to resist the draft. Nothing in the pamphlet suggested that\nthe draftees should use unlawful or violent means to oppose conscription. As Justice Holmes\nfound: “In form at least [the pamphlet] confined itself to peaceful measures, such as a petition for\nthe repeal of the act” and an exhortation to exercise “your right to assert your opposition to the\ndraft.” Many of the pamphlet’s words were quoted directly from the Constitution. It would hard\nto . Aclear case of petitioning one’s government for a redress of grievances, which is\nexplicitly protected by the worlds of the First Amendment.\n\nHolmes also acknowledged that “in many places and in ordinary times the defendants, in saying all\nthat was said in the circular, would have been within their constitutional rights.” “But,” he added,\n“the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is\n\ndone.” And to illustrate that truism he went on to say, “The most stringent protection of free\nspeech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater, and causing a panic.”\n\nJustice Holmes upheld the convictions, finding that the pamphlet created “a clear and present\ndanger” of hindering the war effort while our soldiers were fighting for their lives and our liberty.\n\nThe example of shouting “Fire!” obviously bore little relationship to the facts of the Schenck case.\nThe Schenck pamphlet contained a political message—a series of ideas and arguments. It urged\nits draftee readers to think about the message and then — if they so chose — to act on it ina\nlawful and nonviolent way. The man who shouts “Fire!” in a theater is neither sending a political\nmessage nor inviting his listener to think about what he has said and decide what to do in a\nrational, calculated manner. On the contrary, the message is designed to force action without\ncontemplation. The shout of “Fire!” is directed not to the mind and the conscience of the listener\nbut, rather, to his adrenaline and his feet. It is a stimulus to immediate action, not thoughtful\nreflection.\n\n> The core analogy is the nonverbal alarm, and the derivative example is the verbal shout. By cleverly substituting\nthe derivative shout for the core alarm, Holmes made it possible to analogize one set of words to another—as he\n\n90\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017177",
