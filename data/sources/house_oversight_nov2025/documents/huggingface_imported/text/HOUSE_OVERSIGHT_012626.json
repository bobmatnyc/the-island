  "text": "Talk to Jack Goldberger about this group. They are all very good personal injury lawyers, but I\nhave concerns about whether there would be an inherent tension because they may feel that\nTHEY might make more money (and get a lot more press coverage) if they proceed outside the\nterms of the plea agreement. (Sorry — I just have a bias against plaintiffs’ attorneys.) One nice\nthing about Bert i is that he is in Miami where there has been almost no coverage of this case.\n\nJust so you know, I have never met Bert, but a good friend in our appellate section and one of the\ndistrict judges in Miami are good friends with him and recommended him.\n\nCan you let me know tomorrow? I am going to be out for a while starting on Friday, and I\n_ would like to get this underway before I leave.\n\nThank you.\n\nA. Marie Villafatia\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney\n\n500 S.
