  "text": "782\n\nNovember 5, 2004, when the Court heard\noral argument from the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia in its motion to dismiss the Federal\nInsurance complaint.\n\nI. Subject Matter Jurisdiction Under\nthe FSIA\n\n[2-4] Under the FSIA, a foreign state\nand its instrumentalities are presumed im-\nmune from United States courts’ jurisdic-\ntion. Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 US.\n349, 355, 1138 S.Ct. 1471, 128 L.Ed.2d 47\n(1993); 28 U.S.C. §§ 1602-1607. The\nFSIA’s exceptions to immunity provide the\nsole basis for obtaining subject matter ju-\nrisdiction over a foreign state and its in-\nstrumentalities in federal court. Argen-\ntine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping\nCorp., 488 U.S. 428, 439, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102\nL.Ed.2d 818 (1989); Robinson v. Gov't of\nMalaysia, 269 F.3d 133, 188 (2d Cir.2001).\nFederal courts must inquire at the\n“threshold of every action” against a for-\neign state whether the exercise of its juris-\ndiction is appropriate. Verlinden B.V. v.\nCent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 493,\n103 S.Ct. 1962, 76 L.Ed.2d 81 (1983).\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n[5,6] In a Rule 12(b)() motion to dis-\nmiss challenging subject matter jurisdic-\ntion under the FSIA, “the defendant must\nfirst ‘present a prima facie case that it is a\nforeign sovereign.’” Virtual Cowntries v.\nRepublic of South Africa, 300 F.3d 230,\n241 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting Cargill Intl\nS.A. v. M/T Pavel Dybenko, 991 F.2d\n1012, 1016 (2d Cir.1993)). In response,\nthe plaintiff must present evidence that\none of the statute’s exceptions nullifies the\nimmunity. Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at\n241 (“Determining whether this burden is\nmet involves a ‘review of the allegations in\nthe complaint, the undisputed facts, if any,\n\n15. The parties have agreed that resolution of\nthis motion will also apply to Vigilant Insur-\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nplaced before the court by the parties,\nand—if the plaintiff comes forward with\nsufficient evidence to carry its burden of\nproduction on this issue—resolution of dis-\nputed issues of fact.’”) (citing Robinson,\n269 F.3d at 141); Leutwyler v. Office of\nHer Majesty Queen Rania Al-Abdullah,\n184 F.Supp.2d 277, 287 (S.D.N.Y.2001D\n(explaining plaintiff may “rebut the pre-\nsumption of immunity ... by proffering\nevidence of record that the defendant un-\ndertook certain activities that fall within\nthe scope” of one of the statutory excep-\ntions) (citing Drexel Burnham Lambert\nGroup Inc. v. Comm. of Receivers for\nA.W. Galadari, 12 F.3d 317, 325 (2d Cir.\n1993)). In challenging this Court’s sub-\nject matter jurisdiction, the moving Defen-\ndants retain the ultimate burden of per-\nsuasion. Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at\n241 (citing Cargill, 991 F.2d at 1016);\nRobinson, 269 F.3d at 141 n. 8 (noting\ndefendant’s burden must be met with a\npreponderance of the evidence).\n\n[7] Defendants may “challenge either\nthe legal or factual sufficiency of the plain-\ntiff’s assertion of jurisdiction, or both.”\nRobinson, 269 F.3d at 140 (citations omit-\nted). “If the defendant challenges only\nthe legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs juris-\ndictional allegations, the court must take\nall facts alleged in the complaint as true\nand draw all reasonable inferences in favor\nof the plaintiff.’ Jd. Ginternal quotations\nand citations omitted); Sweet v. Sheahan,\n235 F.3d 80, 83 (2d Cir.2000). “But where\nevidence relevant to the jurisdictional\nquestion is before the court, ‘the district\ncourt ... may refer to that evidence.’ ”\nRobinson, 269 F.3d at 140 (quoting Maka-\nrova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 118\n(2d Cir.2000)); see also Filetech S.A. v.\nFrance Telecom S.A., 157 F.3d 922, 932\n\nance v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 03 Civ.\n8591(RCC).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017847",
