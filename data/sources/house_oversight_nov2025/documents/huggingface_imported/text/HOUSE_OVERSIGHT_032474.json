As discussed, I'm doing a book on the first 100 days of the Trump White House--POTUS and key staff \nknow all about it and are cooperating--and would love to chat with Tom on or off the record.

Also, I'd love a reintroduction to Kathy \nRuemmler. I need some off-the-record perspective on White House procedures. \nAre you in NYC soon? \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
