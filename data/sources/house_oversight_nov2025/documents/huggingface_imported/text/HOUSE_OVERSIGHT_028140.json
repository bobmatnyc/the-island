He also had what was probably the best line in the\ndebate, saying that if Israeli voters were choosing a male model and not a Prime\nMinister, Bibi might indeed be their man. Yet Bibi was much the more polished\nperformer, and the more focused. No matter what question Margalit asked him, he\nalmost invariably answered with the driving message of his campaign: that because\nof Peres, Israeli citizens were living in fear, wondering where the next suicide\nbomber would strike or the next Katyusha would land. And unavoidably, there was\nanother contrast as well: Bibi, who, after all, was 26 years younger, projected\ngreater youth, energy and confidence. When it was over, and Peres asked us how\nhe’d done, we all hemmed and hawed. Only Avraham Burg was prepared to offer a\nclear verdict. He told Peres that Bibi had been the clear winner.\n\nStill, it remained possible that Ramon’s football-game strategy might work.\nThough Peres’s poll lead had been narrowing by the day, he was — just — ahead.\nWith a large number of voters undecided, however, Bibi pulled one final trick out\nof his campaign bag. Under Israeli law, election spending is tightly regulated and\nnearly all campaigning is barred during the last 48 hours before polling day. Yet\nwith the backing of wealthy overseas supporters, the Netanyahu campaign\nsuddenly flooded Israel with blue-and-white banners under the slogan: Bibi, Tov la\nYehudim. “Bibi is good for the Jews.” Would it swing tens of thousands of votes\namong the Orthodox voters who were the main target? It was impossible to say.\nBut it seemed clear it was going to be a very close election.\n\nI had worried for some time we might lose. That was why Nava and I had\npersuaded Michal, our eldest daughter, to bring forward her wedding. She was\nmarrying her teenage boyfriend, a wonderful young man named Ziv Lotenberg.\nThey had originally planned it for a week later. But we did want to risk having it\novershadowed by an election defeat. The wedding took place in a beautiful area of\nlawns and gardens called Ronit Farm, north of Herzliya. It was how weddings are\nmeant to be, full of smiles, good food and dancing. Near the end, Shimon showed\nup. As he walked over to greet us, one guest after another shook his hand, patted\nhim on the back, hugged him, wished him luck. It was as if all the pressure and\ntension of the campaign had suddenly flowed out of him. He smiled, returned the\nembraces, even joined in the dancing. When he left, I told him that he’d done all he\ncould to secure victory, and that I hoped the voters would make the right choice.\n\nThe first exit polls suggested he was going to win. But our internal polling was\nless clear. As more and more votes were counted, Shimon’s margin inexorably\n\n292\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028140",
