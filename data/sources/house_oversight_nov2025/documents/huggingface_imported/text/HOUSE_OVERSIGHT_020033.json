  "text": "The central problem was that the president was neither inclined to make fun of himself,\nnor particularly funny himself—at least not, in Conway’s description, “in that kind of\nhumorous way.”\n\nGeorge W. Bush had famously resisted the Correspondents’ Dinner and suffered\ngreatly at it, but he had prepped extensively, and every year he pulled out an acceptable\nperformance. But neither woman, confiding their concerns around the small table in\nConway’s office to a journalist they regarded as sympathetic, thought Trump had a\nrealistic chance of making the dinner anything like a success.\n\n“He doesn’t appreciate cruel humor,” said Conway.\n“His style is more old-fashioned,” said Hicks.\n\nBoth women, clearly seeing the Correspondents’ Dinner as an intractable problem, kept\ncharacterizing the event as “unfair,” which, more generally, is how they characterized the\nmedia’s view of Trump. “He’s unfairly portrayed.” “They don’t give him the benefit of the\ndoubt.” “He’s just not treated the way other presidents have been treated.”\n\nThe burden here for Conway and Hicks was their understanding that the president did\nnot see the media’s lack of regard for him as part of a political divide on which he stood\non a particular side. Instead, he perceived it as a deep personal attack on him: for entirely\nunfair reasons, ad hominem reasons, the media just did not like him. Ridiculed him.\nCruelly. Why?\n\nThe journalist, trying to offer some comfort, told the two women there was a rumor\ngoing around that Graydon Carter—the editor of Vanity Fair and host of one of the most\nimportant parties of the Correspondents’ Dinner weekend, and, for decades, one of\nTrump’s key tormentors in the media—was shortly going to be pushed out of the\nmagazine.\n\n“Really?” said Hicks, jumping up. “Oh my God, can I tell him? Would that be okay?\nHe’ll want to know this.” She headed quickly downstairs to the Oval Office.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nCuriously, Conway and Hicks each portrayed a side of the president’s alter ego media\nproblem. Conway was the bitter antagonist, the mud-in-your-eye messenger who reliably\nsent the media into paroxysms of outrage against the president. Hicks was the confidante\never trying to get the president a break and some good ink in the only media he really\ncared about—the media that most hated him. But as different as they were in their media\nfunctions and temperament, both women had achieved remarkable influence in the\nadministration by serving as the key lieutenants responsible for addressing the president’s\nmost pressing concern, his media reputation.\n\nWhile Trump was in most ways a conventional misogynist, in the workplace he was\nmuch closer to women than to men. The former he confided in, the latter he held at arm’s\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020033",
