  "text": "Case No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nEdwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment\nPage 12 of 15\n\nreliance on public filings, including the Scherer Complaint against Rothstein is unavailing. As discussed\nabove, the evidence warrants the finding that Epstein knew that Edwards was legitimately pursuing the\nclaims on behalf of his clients which included the effort to secure testimony from Epstein’s close\nconfidants. Therefore, Epstein cannot rely upon the referenced public documents to support his claims\nagainst Edwards given that he knows that information to be untrue and he refuses to answer questions\nabout the veracity of the information. See Exh. G at pgs. 53:6-24; 78:16-24; 87:20-88:14. Consequently,\n\nEpstein had no good faith basis to rely on such information.\n\nEpstein’s Assertion of his Fifth Amendment Privilege Gives Rise to Adverse Inferences\nPertinent to His Motion for Summary Judgment and Precludes His Reliance on Purported\nUndisputed Facts\n\nAs discussed above, Epstein’s multiple invocations of his Fifth Amendment Privilege results in\nadverse inferences which directly impact the issues advanced in his Motion for Summary Judgment. “It\nis well settled that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions\nwhen they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.” Baxter v.\nPalmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976); Accord, Vasquez v. State, 777 So. 2d 1200, 1203 (Fla. at 2001).\nThe reason for this rule “is both logical and utilitarian. A party may not trample upon the rights of others\nand then escape the consequences by invoking a constitutional privilege — at least not in a civil setting.”\nFraser v. Security and INV. Corp, 615 So. 2d. 841, 842 (Fla. 4\" DCA 1993). The adverse inferences\ndrawn from Epstein’s assertion of the Fifth Amendment undercut his claim of justifiable reliance based\nupon the purported undisputed material facts to support his Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\nMoreover, because Epstein elected to hide behind the shield of his right against self-incrimination\nto preclude his disclosing any relevant information about the criminal activity at the center of his claims,\nhe was effectively barred from prosecuting his abuse of process claim against Edwards. Similarly, Epstein\nshould be barred from utilizing the Fifth Amendment privilege to secure summary judgment based upon\n\nassertions of fundamental facts when Epstein refused to testify on essential issues pertinent to the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013315",
