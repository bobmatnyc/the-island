(Photo Reuters )\n\nTo understand the next 4 years, you have to understand the world according to Chicago ...\nWhile Chicago isacityin [Illinois , it is almost a completely different country when\n\nit comes to politics, with a whole different set of morals and language.\n\nThere are only three rules and a Prime Directive which anybody can understand. You don't\neven need an attorney to understand them --and if you need an attorney, well, you know too\nmuch...so look out for Rule #3!\n\nRULE #1...No matter what you see, hear, or do --you don't know anybody and you don't\nknow nothing!\n\nRULE #2...If you capture something on tape or camera -- it doesn't reveal nothing!\n\nRULE #3...1f you know what everybody knows in Chicago --well, you sti//l don't know\nnothing.\n\nThe PRIME DIRECTIVE in CHICAGO ...No matter what the vote Democrats win\nthe election. Now pay close attention!\n\nIt's very simple....we'll illustrate. Remember, you know nothing.\n\nThese two? They don't know each other! They said they didn't.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031013",
