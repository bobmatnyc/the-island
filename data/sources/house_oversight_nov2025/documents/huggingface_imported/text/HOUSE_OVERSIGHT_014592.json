As shown in Exhibit 68, Japanese\nvaluations are middling based on their history\nsince 1999, which we believe is the relevant\nevaluation period given the deflationary headwinds\nthat emerged thereafter. For equity multiples\nto move significantly higher from here would\nrequire sustainable above-trend earnings growth\nor a sizable increase in direct equity purchases\nby the Japanese central bank. But with the BOJ\nalready holding a remarkable 60% of Japanese\nETF market assets!” and profit margins near\ntheir peak levels, neither of these upside catalysts\nseems probable. In fact, P/E multiples are forecast\nto contract in our base case, as the 6% earnings\ngrowth we expect will likely disappoint current\nmarket expectations of 12%.\n\nPutting these pieces together, we expect neither\na boom nor a bust for Japanese equities. Instead,\nthe combination of mid-single-digit earnings\ngrowth, slight compression in valuation multiples\nand a 1.9% dividend yield should generate a\n5% total return. While this return is attractive\nfrom an absolute standpoint, it also comes with\nsignificant downside risks given the country’s\npoor demographics, declining labor force and\nhigh government debt load. Consequently, we are\ntactically neutral on Japanese equities currently.\n\nEmerging Market Equities: Finally in Gear,\nbut Potholes Ahead\n\nEmerging market equities as a whole finally moved\nforward in 2016 after three years in reverse:\nmultiples expanded, earnings estimates improved\nand currencies appreciated, generating a 12%\n\ntotal return. Politics and commodity prices were\nkey performance differentiators among emerging\nmarkets last year, leading Brazil and Russia to the\nwinners’ podium while leaving Turkey and Mexico\nin last place.\n\nWe expect emerging market equities to remain\non track in 2017. Our central case calls for\nearnings growth of 5% in US dollar terms, driven\nby faster nominal GDP growth and the lagged\nimpact of easier financial conditions and higher\ncommodity prices. But with multiples already at\npost-crisis highs in an environment of rising global\nrates and heightened risks, we see little scope for\nfurther expansion. Combining these two inputs\nwith a dividend yield of 2.6%, our forecast implies\na total return of about 7% this year.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty around this forecast\nis quite large, as emerging market equities face\nseveral potential potholes on the road ahead.\nChief among these is the ultimate policy agenda\nof the incoming US administration. On the one\nhand, a policy mix that favors US growth over\ntrade restrictions would support emerging market\nexports and boost profits and equity returns.\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 59\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014592",
