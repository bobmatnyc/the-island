  "text": "139\n\nAlthough the United Front Work Department has attracted much media attention,\n\nand the term “United Front” has become a euphemistic one for many analysts writing\nabout China’s influence activities abroad, the scope of the UFWD’s activities in\nChina’s external influence operations is actually limited. Its primary target audience\n\nis the Chinese diaspora in general, and its elite members in particular. The mission\n\nof engaging and influencing nonethnic Chinese audiences, individuals, and foreign\ninstitutions is assigned to other specialized Chinese entities—such as the Chinese\nAcademy of Social Sciences, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education,\n\nthe Ministry of State Security (e.g., China Institutes of Contemporary International\nRelations), and other institutions that have well-trained professionals and long-standing\n\nties with their counterparts overseas.\n\nInternational [Liaison] Department\n\nThe CCP’s International [Liaison] Department (#RE44#8) is in charge of “party-to-\nparty relations” (3#fRX¥) and has the primary mission of cultivating foreign political\nparties and politicians around the world. This Party organ has existed since before\n1949 and was formerly charged with maintaining China’s fraternal ties with other\ncommunist and socialist parties around the world, but in the wake of the Cold War,\nthe CCP/ID drastically broadened its mandate to interact with virtually all political\nparties abroad (except fascist and racist parties). Today it claims to maintain ties\nwith over 400 political parties in 140 countries, receives about 200 delegations,\n\nand dispatches about 100 abroad every year. CCP/ID exchanges have provided an\nimportant prism through which the CCP and other organizations in China monitor\nthe outside world and absorb lessons for China’s own modernization. This kind of\ninformation gathering goes well beyond traditional intelligence collection (although,\n\nto be sure, the ID also engages in this activity).\n\nThrough its interactions with political parties all over the world, the CCP/ID serves\n\nan important function as a kind of “radar” for identifying up-and-coming foreign\npoliticians before they attain national prominence and office. Having identified\nsuch rising stars, the CCP/ID brings them to China (usually on all-expenses-paid\nvisits) often offering them their first exposure to China and trying to make the\nbest possible impression on them. Another key dimension of this function has been to\nexpose CCP leaders at the provincial and sub-provincial levels to the outside world—\noften for the first time. Many provincial Party secretaries, governors, mayors and other\n\nleading local cadres are taken abroad on ID delegations every year. The CCP/ID has\n\nAppendix 1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020598",
