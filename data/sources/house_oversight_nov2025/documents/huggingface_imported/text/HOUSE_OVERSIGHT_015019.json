We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between\nthe actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack\non the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no\nuncertain terms sponsored terrorism:\n\n(Writes Scott) \"The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult\nand painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection\nwe have surveyed:\n\n1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to\nparticipate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing;\n\n2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which could\nhave prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing;\n\n3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him\nfree to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing;\n\n4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an \"unindicted coconspirator\" in the 1993 WTC bombing case\nand Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing.\n\n(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State)\n\nScott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack\non the WTC:\n\n(Writes Scott) \"For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened,\nletting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by\nsome as \"conspiracy theory.\" Yet in this chapter, | will show that this claim doesn't to arise from\ntheory, but from facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-\nreported in the American mainstream media. | am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015019",
