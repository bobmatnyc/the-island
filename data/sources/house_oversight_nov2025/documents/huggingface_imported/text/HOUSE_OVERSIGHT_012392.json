  "text": "my opinion, is clearly unconstitutional.\" Id. at 1357. The President stated that, \"[i]n order that I may be\non record as indicating my opinion that the foregoing provision of the so-called Lend-Lease Act is\nunconstitutional, and in order that my approval of the bill, due to the existing exigencies of the world\nsituation, may not be construed as a tacit acquiescence in any contrary view, I am requesting you to\nplace this memorandum in the official files of the Department of Justice. I am desirous of having this\ndone for the further reason that I should not wish my action in approving the bill which includes this\ninvalid clause, to be used as a precedent for any future legislation comprising provisions of a similar\nnature.\" Id. at 1358.\n\n2) Message to the Congress on Legislative Vetoes, Pub. Papers of Jimmy Carter 1146 (Jun. 21, 1978 ):\n\nIn this memorandum President Carter expressed his strong opposition to legislative vetoes and stated\nthat \"[t]he inclusion of [a legislative veto] in a bill will be an important factor in my decision to sign or\nto veto it.\" Id. at 1148. He further stated that, \"[a]s for legislative vetoes over the execution of programs\nalready prescribed in legislation and in bills I must sign for other reasons, the Executive Branch will\ngenerally treat them as 'report-and-wait' provisions. In such a case, if Congress subsequently adopts a\nresolution to veto an Executive action, we will give it serious consideration, but we will not, under our\nreading of the Constitution, consider it legally binding.\" Id. at 1149.\n\nHistorical Materials\n\n1) Statement of James Wilson on December 1, 1787 on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution,\nreprinted in 2 Jonathan Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 418 (1836): Wilson argued that the\nConstitution imposed significant -- and sufficient -- restraints on the power of the legislature, and that\nthe President would not be dependent upon the legislature. In this context, he stated that \"the power of\nthe Constitution was paramount to the power of the legislature acting under that Constitution; for it is\npossible that the legislature . . . may transgress the bounds assigned to it, and an act may pass, in the\nusual mode, notwithstanding that transgression; but when it comes to be discussed before the judges,--\nwhen they consider its principles, and find it to be incompatible with the superior power of the\nConstitution,-- it is their duty to pronounce it void . . . . In the same manner, the President of the United\nStates could shield himself, and refuse to carry into effect an act that violates the Constitution.\" Id. at\n445-46.\n\n2) Letter from Chief Justice Chase to Gerrit Smith (Apr. 19, 1868), quoted in J. Schuckers, The Life\nand Public Services of Salmon Portland Chase 577 (1874): Chase stated that President Johnson took\n\nthe proper action in removing Secretary of War Stanton without Senate approval, in light of Johnson's\nbelief that the statutory restriction on his removal authority was unconstitutional. In this regard, Chase\ncommented that \"the President had a perfect right, and indeed was under the highest obligation, to\nremove Mr. Stanton, if he made the removal not in wanton disregard of a constitutional law, but with a\nsincere belief that the Tenure-of-Office Act was unconstitutional and for the purpose of bringing the\nquestion before the Supreme Court.\" Id. at 578.\n\nCongressional Materials\n\n1) The President's Suspension of the Competition in Contracting Act is Unconstitutional, H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 138, 99th Cong., Ist Sess. (1985): The House Committee on Government Operations concluded\nthatthe President lacked the authority to refuse to implement any provision of the Competition in\nContracting Act. The Committee stated that, \"[t]o adopt the view that one's oath to support and defend\nthe Constitution is a license to exercise any available power in furtherance of one's own constitutional\ninterpretation would quickly destroy the entire constitutional scheme. Such a view, whereby the\nPresident pledges allegiance to the Constitution but then determines what the Constitution means,\ninexorably leads to the usurpation by the Executive of the others' roles.\" Id. at 11. The Committee also\nstated that \"[t]he Executive's suspension of the law circumvents the constitutionally specified means\nfor expressing Executive objections to law and is a constitutionally impermissible absolute veto\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012392",
