  "text": "each is laid out in clinical, lurid, and near-identical detail. A cold Epstein\ndemands that these allegedly unwitting juveniles (though they have come here for\nthis very purpose) perform repulsive (or at least repulsively described) acts on him\nand then they return again. (Although the nature of the allegations will\ndramatically grow into threesomes and forced sexual encounters, nobody at this\npoint alleges anything more than Epstein masturbating. )\n\nEpstein vastly raises the stakes by calling Dershowitz, who flies into Palm\nBeach to put the local authorities in their place—alienating Palm Beach\nofficialdom—and, doubling down on the profile of the case, brings in Roy Black\nthe famous criminal attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape\ntrial in Palm Beach.\n\nHere’s the narrative: the shadowy rich man, friend of the louche and\ndisgraced President, at all times surrounded by a retinue of young and gorgeous\nfemale retainers doing his bidding, is now found to have gathered a network of\nwrong-side-of-the-tracks Palm Beach girls to provide him with weird sexual\nservices. (It somehow reads weirder that he doesn’t have sex with them.) To boot,\nhis former girl friend, Ghislaine Maxwell—the daughter of the disgraced Robert\nMaxwell—encouraged at least one of the girls to come to Epstein’s home (and\nforever more has become a fixture of further weird possibilities in this tale).\n\nPalm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter is reported to say: “This is bigger\nthan Rush Limbaugh,” who, in a storm of publicity, has just been arrested in Palm\nBeach for possession of controlled drugs.\n\nOn one side are some of the nation’s most powerful defense attorneys (who,\nincreasingly, seem more stumblebum than effective), on the other side, a round-up\nof hapless girls, with sensational tales of perversion and infamy (in the telling they\nare not so much sex workers, as Dickensian victims), relatively speaking giving the\nPalm Beach authorities the choice between utter capitulation to the powerful or\nstanding on the side of the seemingly exploited and powerless.\n\nStill, with a cold eye, it also quite appears to be a straightforward tale of\nprostitution (however more or less kinky). And even though some of the girls are\nminors, age is not a distinguishing factor in a solicitation charge in Florida, (in\nNew York, for instance, at this time soliciting sex with anyone over the age of 14\nis a class D misdemeanor calling for a $100 fine—the law has recently been\nchanged to TK).\n\nIn fact, the very “SG” clearly tells the police that she lied about being 18\nbecause otherwise she knew she would not have been admitted to the house (other\ngirls will say they knew this is what they had to say, nevertheless not stopping\nthem from saying it).\n\nThe local sex crimes prosecutor, Lana Belhalevic, interviews all the girls and\ndetermines that the offense is solely related to prostitution—that there are “no real\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022858",
