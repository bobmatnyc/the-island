We know that\ninformation and communication technology has\nevolved significantly and innovation is occurring\nat a rapid pace. We know that the BEA reviews\nits statistical methodologies every five years\nand revises them as needed, recognizing that\nmeasurement methodologies have to evolve with\nthe evolution of the US economy. We also know\nthat we as consumers carry incredibly powerful\ndigital equipment in the palms of our hands and\npay less for it than we paid for equipment with\nlesser functionalities not so long ago. Common\nsense supplemented by extensive research by the\nexperts on productivity and mismeasurement\nreinforces our view of a glass half-full when it\ncomes to innovation and productivity in the US.\n\nWe realize this debate will be resolved only\nwith the benefit of hindsight, in the same way\nthat realized productivity growth exceeded the\n\nWe realize this debate will be resolved\nonly with the benefit of hindsight, in\nthe same way that realized productivity\ngrowth exceeded the prognostications\n\nof Hansen in the late 1930s and\nKrugman in the early 1990s.\n\nprognostications of Hansen in the late 1930s and\nKrugman in the early 1990s. Our clients will be\ninundated with conflicting views from headlines\nin the media and books with captivating titles.\nSeparating fact from fiction remains challenging.\nRecently, an article in the Wall Street Journal\nhighlighted “dwindling gains in science, technology\nand medicine.”*° The article suggested that\nimprovements in breast cancer mortality have\nslowed since 1985. Exhibit 15 shows the 10-year\nnet survival rate for breast cancer and prostate\ncancer since 1971. Maybe it is only a matter of\nperspective, but, to us, a 78% 10-year survival rate\nfor breast cancer and an 84% 10-year survival\nrate for prostate cancer represent significant\nimprovements over the rates of the early 1980s,\n48% and 25%, respectively, and are even more\nsignificant for those whose lives have been saved.\nProbably one of the more amusing instances\nof conflicting perspectives can be seen in the\n2016 publication of two books with\ndiametrically opposed messages:\nProgress: Ten Reasons to Look\nForward to the Future“ and The\nInnovation Illusion: How So Little\nIs Created by So Many Working So\nHard, both written by authors born\nin Sweden in the early 1970s. Our\nviews, of course, are more aligned\nwith the first book. The second book,\nhowever, raises important concerns\nabout excessive regulation and how\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014550",
