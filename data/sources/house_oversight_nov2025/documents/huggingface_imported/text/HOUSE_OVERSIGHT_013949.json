In\nthe context of this chapter, “job” will refer to both a company if you run one and a normal job if you\nhave one. Some recommendations are limited to one of the two but most are relevant to both. So we\nbegin.\n\nI have quit three jobs and been fired from most of the rest. Getting fired, despite sometimes coming as\na surprise and leaving you scrambling to recover, is often a godsend: Someone else makes the decision\nfor you, and it’s impossible to sit in the wrong job for the rest of your life. Most people aren’t lucky\nenough to get fired and die a slow spiritual death over 30-40 years of tolerating the mediocre.\n\nPride and Punishment\n\nIf you must play, decide on three things at the start: the rules of the game, the stakes, and the\nquitting time.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013949",
