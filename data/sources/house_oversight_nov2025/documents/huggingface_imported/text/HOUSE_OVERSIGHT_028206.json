There is no power in the world that can force on us\ncollective national suicide. Peace will be achieved only if there is a willingness to\nnegotiate on both sides. I am sure the people of Israel, and the American people,\nwill understand it when the details will be revealed.”\n\nClinton had already left for Arafat’s cabin by the time Danny Yatom went to\ndeliver the letter. But the President, too, was in a more sober and downbeat mood\nby the time that meeting was over. Late that night when, having now read my note,\nhe joined me on the balcony of Dogwood. He looked exhausted. “It was the\ntoughest meeting I’ve ever had with Arafat,” he said. Clinton said he had told the\nPalestinian leader that only one side, the Israelis, had so far been negotiating in\ngood faith.

Shlomo and Gili\nwent beyond what I could live with. If this offer can’t move him, then I believe we\nare left to prepare for war.” I told the President he didn’t even need to phone me\nafter hearing from Arafat if all he offered was some clever half-reply. Only if it\nwas serious and substantive. I also reminded him that while he’d promised Arafat\nthat he would not “blame” the Palestinians if the summit failed, that had been on\nthe basis of negotiating in good faith. I hoped that, if the summit collapsed in these\ncircumstances, he would keep to that standard.\n\nFinally, I touched on an immediate concern if the summit broke up. For months,\nthe Palestinians had been talking about simply “declaring” a Palestinian state. The\nAmericans had insisted neither side should resort to unilateral action in a conflict\nwhose resolution depended on mutual agreement. The Europeans had been less\n\n358\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028206",
