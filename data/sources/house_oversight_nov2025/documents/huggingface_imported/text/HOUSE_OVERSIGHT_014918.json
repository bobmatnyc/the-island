  "text": "Priceline (Buy, $1,920 PO)\n\nStock view: Expect solid 1Q top-line, but 2Q can be rough for guidance\n\nPriceline’s metric trends and commentary, along with 1Q booking and room night\nguidance, indicate that the company continues to capture strong market share growth in\nthe category, with little impact from hotel direct booking initiatives or competitive OTA\nmarketing spend. We expect a strong 1Q, with perhaps a little less upside than usual\ndue to the late 4Q reporting date.\n\nLooking forward to 2Q, we have our usual caution on guidance as 2Q is the most back-\nend loaded quarter for bookings and revenues. However, in 2017 the Easter shift is a\npositive factor and will help 2Q revenues and earnings. We also expect 1Q bookings and\nroom night growth upside to translate into higher 2Q gross profit growth, and\nmanagement indicated that there is less marketing ROI pressure expected in 1H'17 than\nin 2H'16. Overall, we expect Priceline’s strong business trends to continue, and would\nuse extra conservatism in guidance as a buying opportunity.\n\nGiven strong execution and higher exposure to more fragmented International markets,\nPriceline remains our top long-term idea in Online travel. However, on a near-term\nbasis, we think Expedia could see a bigger stock benefit from an acceleration in room\nnight growth over the summer.\n\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Room night growth\n\nWe expect Priceline to report 26% y/y room night growth (deceleration v. 31% in 4Q),\nahead of the company’s outlook of 20-25% hotel room night growth. Priceline has a\nhistory of guiding 1Q conservatively, looking at Priceline’s historical 1Q results for\nBookings, revenue and EPS vs guidance suggests modest upside to our bookings growth\nforecast of 22% and reported 1Q’17 EPS closer to $9.55 (13% upside vs. the midpoint)\nvs. our estimate of $9.08 and the Street’s estimate $8.75.\n\nTable 20: 1Q Bookings Growth, Revenue Growth and EPS Guidance vs. Actuals\n\n1013 1014 1Q15 1Q16 1Q17\nGuidance Actual Upside Guidance Actual Upside Guidance Actual Upside Guidance Actual Upside Guidance Actual Upside\nBookings 30-37% 36% No 23-33% 34% Yes 29% 12% Yes 12-19% 21% Yes 17-22% ?\nInternational Bookings FX-Neutral 35-42% 43% Yes 25-35% 38% Yes 17-24% 29% Yes NA NA NIA\nRevenue 17-24% 26% Yes 15-25% 26% Yes 4.11% 12% Yes 9-16% 17% Yes NIA\nEPS $4.90-$5.30 $5.76 Yes $6.35-$6.85 $7.81 Yes $/.20-7.75 $812 Yes $9.00-9.60 $10.54 Yes | $8.25-8.65 2?\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg, Priceline\n\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n¢ Concerns on threat of increasing marketing competition with Expedia and\nTripAdvisor\n\n¢ Potential pressure on US inbound traffic given the Trump travel ban (unlikely to\nimpact Priceline given high Intl exposure)\n\n« Marketing deleverage — our model assumes 340bps of y/y online marketing\ndeleverage in 1Q\n\n« Pressure on hotel revenue take rates given less hotel participation in commission\nprograms and longer booking windows\n\nEarly 1Q RevPAR data mixed\n\nPriceline’s Booking.com has roughly 1.2mn properties on its site (>611k hotels and 576k\nvacation rental properties).
