Would like to hear more from you about them, when we have a chance. Is it worldwide, or \nmostly here? \nMy impression is that the fear is mostly in the US. There's nothing in (much more vulnerable) Europe comparable to the \nVisa Waiver program (insanely targeting Iran, which has not been involved in terrorism, while exempting Saudi Arabia, \nthe source of almost all jihadi terrorism). Or Trump-style ban them all. Or Cruz-style carpet-bomb them. For a long \ntime, probably back to colonial days, this has been a very frightened country, maybe the safest in the world but also the \nmost frightened. Impressions. \nSometimes it's quite weird. By accident, I took the first flight PanAm 103 after the Lockerbie bombing, together with an \nold friend, a veteran Middle East correspondent. It must have been the safest flight in human history. The plane was \nempty. We were bumped up to first class because there was no one there. \nFrom: jeffrey E.

Saudi and Iran doing the same, dividing spheres of influence. . it seems few people paying \nattention to palestinians . maybe next generation. - israel going further right it appears. I find that media \ninduced fear is driving world markets. . very odd. gas prices down nobody shopping, . hotel prices down less \ntravel, commodity prices way down, little building. luxury market decimated. no russians or chinese \nplayers. . still virtually zero interest rates. . borrowing not up, fear and paralysis. , ( I add these topics as to \nthese at least, i can speak with a modicum of knowledge ) \nOn Thu, Dec 24, 2015 at 10:51 AM, Noam Chomsky < > wrote: \nThis is the program David Marr initiated, developed by Shimon Ullman and others. Makes sense, and there are some \ninteresting results. David was a friend, and we often discussed these topics. In fact, his famous three levels adapted a \nmodel from generative grammar. But there was always the fundamental problem I mentioned. Vision is an input \nsystem, crafting coherent images from lines, points of light, etc. Language is used for that purpose too, but it's not \nwhat language is. \nThat fundamental difference, along with the fact that the principles involved seem quite different, has always been a \nstumbling block to seeking any link. \nFrom: jeffrey E.

The visual grammar just grows, and as is known, \ncan develop in various ways depending on early experience. Same with the language grammar, though the period in \nwhich experience has a shaping effect is much longer. \nHowever, there are fundamental differences between vision and language. Can send you a recent paper about it if \nyou like. Vision is an input system. Language isn't. It's an internal capacity, a system of knowledge, which is used to \nprocess input and also to produce thoughts (sometimes externalized). Seems also to be modality independent. And \ntheir properties look wholly different, so it's hard to see how one could piggy-back on the other. \nNoam \nFrom: jeffrey E.
