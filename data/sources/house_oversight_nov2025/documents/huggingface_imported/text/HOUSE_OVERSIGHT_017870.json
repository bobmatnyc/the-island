  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n805\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nwithin the state ....” N.Y. C.P.L.R.\n§ 302(a)(2) (McKinney 2002). Courts have\ndefined “agent” to include a defendant’s\nco-conspirators “under certain circum-\nstances.” Chrysler Capital Corp. v. Cen-\ntury Power Corp., T78 F.Supp. 1260, 1266\n(S.D.N.Y.1991) (citing Lehigh Valley In-\ndus., Inc. v. Byrenbaum, 389 F.Supp. 798,\n806-07 (S.D.N.Y.1975), affd, 527 F.2d 87\n(2d Cir.1975)). Thus, “acts committed in\nNew York by the co-conspirator of an out-\nof-state defendant pursuant to a conspira-\ncy may subject the out-of-state defendant\nto jurisdiction under C.P.L.R. 302(a)(2).”\nChrysler Capital Corp. 778 F.Supp. at\n1266.\n\n[38-40] Plaintiffs are not required to\nestablish the existence of a “formal agency\nrelationship” between the Defendants and\ntheir putative co-conspirators. Daventree\nLid. v. Republic of Azerbayan, 349\nF.Supp.2d 736, at 759, 2004 WL 2997881,\nat *18 (S.D.N.Y.2004). Yet, “the bland\nassertion of conspiracy ... is insufficient\nto establish jurisdiction for the purposes of\nsection 302(a)(2).” Lehigh Valley Indus.\nInc., 527 F.2d at 93-94; Lamarr v. Klein,\n35 A.D.2d 248, 315 N.Y.S.2d 695, 697-98\n(st Dep’t 1970) (holding that conclusory\nstatements about defendant’s role in con-\nspiracy were insufficient to establish juris-\ndiction under the co-conspirator doctrine).\nTo establish personal jurisdiction on a con-\nspiracy theory, Plaintiffs must make a pri-\nma facie showing of conspiracy, allege spe-\ncific facts warranting the inference that\nthe defendant was a member of the con-\nspiracy, and show that the defendant’s co-\nconspirator committed a tort in New York.\nChrysler Capital Corp. 778 F.Supp. at\n1266 (citing Singer v. Bell, 585 F.Supp.\n300, 302 (S.D.N.Y.1984)).\n\n[41] “To plead a valid cause of action\nfor conspiracy under New York law, a\nplaintiff must allege the primary tort and\nfour elements: ‘(a) a corrupt agreement\n\nbetween two or more persons, (b) an overt\nact in furtherance of the agreement, (c) the\nparties’ intentional participation in the fur-\ntherance of a plan or purpose, and (d) the\nresulting damage or injury.” Chrysler\nCapital Corp. T78 F.Supp. at 1267 (quoting\nKashi v. Gratsos, 790 F.2d 1050, 1055 (2d\nCir.1986)). To warrant the inference that\na defendant was a member of the conspira-\ncy, Plaintiffs must show that “(a) the de-\nfendant had an awareness of the effects in\nNew York of its activity; (b) the activity of\nthe co-conspirators in New York was to\nthe benefit of the out-of-state conspirators;\nand (c) the co-conspirators acting in New\nYork acted ‘at the direction or under the\ncontrol’ or ‘at the request of or on behalf\nof the out-of-state defendant.” Chrysler\nCapital Corp. 778 F.Supp. at 1268-69\n(quoting Dixon v. Mack, 507 F.Supp. 345,\n350 (S.D.N.Y.1980)).\n\n“Whether an alleged conspiracy ... ex-\nisted is ‘a mixed question of law and\nfact.’” Daventree, 349 F.Supp.2d 736, at\n760, 2004 WL 2997881, at *19 (quoting\nMario Valente Collezioni: Ltd. v. Confez-\nont Semeraro Paolo, S.R.L., 264 F.3d 32,\n36 (2d Cir.2001)). Accordingly, the Court\ncannot accept “conclusory assertions on\nthose issues; instead it must resolve such\nquestions based upon an independent ex-\namination of the factual allegations while\nmindful of its duty to draw all factual\ninferences in plaintiffs’ favor.” Jd. (reject-\ning conspiracy theory of personal jurisdic-\ntion without permitting jurisdictional dis-\ncovery).\n\n[42] Plaintiffs claim that all Defen-\ndants in these actions conspired with the al\nQaeda terrorists to perpetrate the attacks\nof September 11. See, eg., Ashton Com-\nplaint 1296; Federal Complaint 11 66, 72-\n74. Without supporting factual allega-\ntions, such a statement is insufficient to\nestablish an agency relationship. Lehigh\nValley Indus. Inc., 527 F.2d at 93-94; Da-\nventree, 349 F.Supp.2d 736 at 762-63, 2004\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017870",
