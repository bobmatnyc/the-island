SBG’s motions to\ndismiss the Ashton and Burnett complaints\nfor failure to state a claim are therefore\ndenied without prejudice.\n\n7. SAAR Network\n\n[101] The Federal Plaintiffs’ allega-\ntions against the SAAR Network are out-\nlined in Part II.C.9. The Court’s analysis\nof the SAAR Network’s arguments in fa-\nvor of 12(b)(6) dismissal depend on a pred-\nicate finding of which entities are subject\nto this Court’s personal jurisdiction and\nwhich entities—and under what circum-\nstances—transferred money to terror\nfronts. Accordingly, the SAAR Network’s\nmotion to dismiss is denied without preju-\ndice. It may be renewed upon completion\nof personal jurisdiction discovery.\n\n8. Adel A.J. Batterjee\n\n[102] The Burnett Plaintiffs’ allega-\ntions against Mr. Batterjee are outlined in\nPart II.C.10. For substantially the same\nreasons the Court found it had personal\njurisdiction over Mr. Batterjee, it denies\nhis motion to dismiss for failure to state a\nclaim. The allegations against him and his\ndesignation as a terrorist are sufficient to\npermit the inference that he provided sup-\nport to al Qaeda directly or through Al\nShamal Islamic Bank, BIF, or WAMY.\nBurnett Complaint 1975-76, 183-84, 196,\n199, 230; Exec.
