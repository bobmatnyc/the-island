Because of the\nwinner takes all system in France we find investors are more concerned with the\nsituation there. Marine Le Pen and the Front National look likely to make it to the\nsecond round of voting (again according to polls) and until the vote comes in we suspect\ninvestors will be cautious about European markets. A Le Pen victory could likely bring\nthe future of the EU and the Euro into question as she has talked about France\nwithdrawing from both. That in turn has arguably the potential to be even more of an\nearthquake for the world’s financial markets. Our central case is that centre right\nPresident is elected in France (with Francois Fillon now the official Republican\ncandidate) and Merkel is returned at the head of a coalition government in Germany.\n\nChart 19: German polls show a consistent lead for Merkel’s CDU party Chart 20: Fillon well ahead of Le Pen in polls showing a potential run-off\n40 100\n: 90\n\" Oy On%@ gate 20 tHe “008 as” “ehan 46 06 4 80\n30 +4 4 a aa a a4 a4 4 70\n2 1 an aMMe, 0.0 06 Oas,, 4 OaatPBasatataiaa” a\n20 ‘a! ll WHY Weems’ Wemen’) anehame@eh 4 50\n40\n18 z ri 30\n40 Ma aat@Pannatatatatata*an*enans aMa 20\n5 10\n@CDU @SPD aAfD 0\n0 rw eee 12-14 15-17 13-16 10-12 14-17 9-11 25-Nov 27-Nov\nOND IND ND ND ND NTP ND ND ND PND ND ND GN AP ND ND ND CAD END NS | 7\nFes vee Sy SES ov ox or an in d SO see April April May June June Sept\nHEELEEEEEE SS PEPE P PORE m Francois Fillon (%)  ™ Marine Le Pen (%)\n\nSource: Ifop (12-14 Apr, 14-17 Jun), BVA (15-17 Apr, 13-16 Mar, 10-12 Jun, 9-11 Sept), Odoxa (25\n\nSource: Allensbach (15-Sept, 13-Oct), Emnid (7-Sept, 14-Sept, 21-Sept, 28-Sept, 5-Oct, 12-Oct, 19- Nov), Harris Interactive (27 Nov}, Note: all 2016.\n\nOct, 26-Oct, 2-Nov, 9-Nov, 19-Nov), Forsa (2-Sept, 9-Sept, 16-Sept, 23-Sept, 30-Sept, 7-Oct, 14-Oct,\n21-Oct, 28-Oct, 4-Nov), Forschungsgruppe Wahlen (22-Sept, 13-Oct, 27-Oct, 10-Nov), GMS (14-Sept,\n12-Oct, 12-Nov), Infratest dimap (21-Sept, 5-Oct, 19-Oct, 2-Nov), INSA (5-Sept, 12-Sept, 19-Sept, 26-\nSept, 3-Oct, 10-Oct, 17-Oct, 24-Oct, 2-Nov, 7-Nov, 14-Nov, 22-Nov), Ipsos (10-Oct)\n\nWere this to be the case then we think there may well be room for a significant relief\nrally in European assets.

Going forward we see it as\nan ongoing issue but mostly for the UK. The political uncertainty is likely to be extended,\neven after Article 50 is triggered as any significant negotiations probably need to await\nthe outcome of the French and German elections. We expect the UK economy to\nstruggle as the lagged effect of the fall in the currency hurts consumers and while there\nmay be contrarian trades available in the GBP during 2017, our strategists think it goes\nlower first on the triggering of Article 50.\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n12 Global Cross Asset Strategy - Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014443",
