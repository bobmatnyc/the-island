  "text": "reconcile. She came back, not for the money, but because she sincerely\nbelieved that the nation needed Jack Kennedy, and she didn't want to bear\nthe burden of losing enough public favor to forestall his winning the\npresidency.\n\nConsequently she was destined to bear a quite different burden--\nwith great ambivalence--the paradox of fame. She enjoyed playing her role\nto the hilt, but complained, “Can't they get it into their heads that there's\na difference between being the First Lady and being Elizabeth Taylor?”\nEven after she became First Widow, the movie magazines would not--or\ncould not--leave her alone. Probably the most bizarre invasion of her\nprivacy occurred in Photoplay, which asked the question, “Too Soon for\nLove?” --then proceeded to print a coupon that readers were requested\nto answer and send in. They had a multiple choice: “Should Jackie (1)\nDevote her life exclusively to her children and the memory of her husband?\n(2) Begin to date--privately or publicly--and eventually remarry? (3)\n\n“Marry right away?” Mrs. Kennedy fumed. “Why don't they give them\nsome more decisions to make for me? Some rea/ ones. Should | live in\noccasional sin? Should | use a diaphragm or the pill? Should | keep it in the\nmedicine cabinet or the bureau drawer?” But she would never lose her\n\ndignity in public; she had too deep a faith in her own image.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015084",
