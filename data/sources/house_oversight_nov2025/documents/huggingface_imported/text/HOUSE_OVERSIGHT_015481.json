Every atom of iron in your blood, which helps\nyour heart shuttle oxygen from your lungs to your\ncells, once helped destroy a massive star. The fierce\nnuclear fusion reactions that set stars ablaze create\nthe atomic elements of life. As the star ages, it fus-\nes progressively larger elements, such as silicon, sul-\nfur, and calcrum. Eventually, iron atoms are fused.\nThe problem is that iron fusion consumes as much\n\nenergy as it produces, so it weakens the star. If the\n\nstar is big enough, it will collapse in on itself, its outer\nlayers rebounding against the dense imner core, and a\nsupernova explosion will result. The blast sprays out\n\niron at supersonic speeds, fillmg great swathes of space\nwith debris that can form new solar systems. The iron\nin your frying pan, house keys, and blood is essentially\ncosmic shrapnel from the tremendous explosions that\nripped through our galaxy billions of years ago. The\nsame blasts also released carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and\nother elements of life, which later produced the sun,\nthe Earth, and eventually—you. ©\n\ncurt stager is an ecologist and climate scientist at Paul\nSmith’s College.
