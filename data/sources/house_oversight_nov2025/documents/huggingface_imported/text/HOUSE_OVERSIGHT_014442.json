We have core PCE in the US reaching 1.9%\nnext year in our core scenario. Our headline inflation numbers are higher because of the\nexpected increase in the oil price from our commodity strategists. Indeed with oil\nexpected to reach $60pb (OPEC permitting) headline CPI inflation in the US could push\n3%. In the Euro Area we see headline inflation rising to 1.2%, albeit with core inflation\nonly nudging modestly higher. UK inflation is expected to move markedly higher care of\nthe lower pound, again with headline inflation pushing towards 3%. In Japan driven by\nour more optimistic view of the economy we project core CPI at 1%.\n\nChart 17: BofAML sees GDP accelerating into 2018...

Both had something to\ndo with the Peak Inequality and Peak Globalisation themes. Politicians on both sides of\nthe Atlantic tapped into a deep disquiet, particularly amongst white male blue collar\nvoters that they were not benefitting from this new globalised world. If opinion polls are\nto be believed (something which we have all learnt to question) then Italy may well end\nthe year with another vote against the governing party - although that one is perhaps a\nlittle more complicated to dissect. We recently added a put spread on the eurostoxx to\nhedge against such a bad outcome here, which would be the case if it is perceived to be\n\nBankof America 2 Global Cross Asset Strategy - Year Ahead | 30 November 2016-11\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014442",
