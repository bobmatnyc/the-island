  "text": "Becoming a member of the NR is not just about working smarter. It’s about building a system to\nreplace yourself.\n\nThis is the first exercise.\n\nEven if you have no intention of becoming an entrepreneur, this is the ultimate continuation of our\n80/20 and elimination process: Preparing someone to replace you (even if it never happens) will produce\nan ultrarefined set of rules that will cut remaining fat and redundancy from your schedule. Lingering\nunimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them.\n\nBut what about the cost?\n\nThis is a hurdle that is hard for most. If I can do it better than an assistant, why should I pay them at\nall? Because the goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things.\n\nThis chapter is a low-cost exercise to get you past this lifestyle limiter. It is absolutely necessary that\nyou realize that you can always do something more cheaply yourself. This doesn’t mean you want to\nspend your time doing it. If you spend your time, worth $20—25 per hour, doing something that someone\nelse will do for $10 per hour, it’s simply a poor use of resources. It is important to take baby steps\ntoward paying others to do work for you. Few do it, which is another reason so few people have their\nideal lifestyles.\n\nEven if the cost is occasionally more per hour than you currently earn, the trade is often worth it. Let’s\nassume you make $50,000 and thus $25 per hour (working from 9-5, Monday through Friday, for 50\nweeks per year). If you pay a top-notch assistant $30 per hour and he or she saves you one full 8-hour\nshift per week, your cost (subtracting what you’re being paid) is $40 to free an extra day. Would you pay\n$40 per week to work Monday to Thursday? I would, and I do. Keep in mind that this is a worst-case\ncost scenario.\n\nBut what if your boss freaks out?\n\nIt’s largely a non-issue, and prevention is better than cure. There is no ethical or legal reason for the\nboss to know if you choose non-sensitive tasks. The first option is to assign personal items. Time is time,\nand if you’re spending time on chores and errands that could be spent better elsewhere, a VA will\nimprove life and the management learning curve is similar. Second, you can delegate business tasks that\ndon’t include financial information or identify your company.\n\nReady to build an army of assistants? Let’s first look at the dark side of delegation. A review is in\norder to prevent abuses of power and wasteful behavior.\n\nDelegation Dangers: Before Getting Started\n\nThe first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient\noperation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient\noperation will magnify the inefficiency.\n\n— BILL GATES\n\nH... you ever been given illogical assignments, handed unimportant work, or commanded to do\n\nsomething in the most inefficient fashion possible? Not fun and not productive.\n\nNow it’s your turn to show that you know better. Delegation is to be used as a further step in\nreduction, not as an excuse to create more movement and add the unimportant. Remember—unless\nsomething is well-defined and important, no one should do it.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013875",
