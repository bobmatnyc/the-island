  "text": "KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\nRelevant Past Cases\n\nWe have not been able to find a single federal prosecution based on facts like these—but\nhave voluminous evidence of federal prosecutors routinely declining to bring charges in cases far\nmore egregious than this one. To take just one obvious example, federal prosecutors have self-\nconsciously refrained from involvement in the literally dozens of sexual cases of former priests,\nopting instead to allow seasoned state prosecutors (like the ones in this case) to pursue the\naccused former clergymen. That is so despite (1) the large number of victims, (2) the vast\ngeographic diversity of the cases, and (3) the fact that some of these cases involve allegations\nthat the defendant forcibly molested, abused, or raped literally dozens of children—including\nsome as young as five years old—over a period of years. Nonetheless, federal prosecutors have\nnot hesitated to let their state counterparts pursue these cases free from federal interference—\neven though the sentences meted out vary greatly on account of the fact that “[c]riminal penalties\nare specific to localities or jurisdictions.”3 The facts of this case, which involve the solicitation\nof consensual topless massages and some sexual contact, entirely in the privacy of his home and\nalmost entirely by women over the age of 18, pale in comparison to the outright sexual abuse and\ndegradation of preteen minors in many of the priest cases.\n\nNor does this case bear any of the hallmarks that typify the cases that federal prosecutors\nhave pursued under the federal statutes at issue here. When asked, the closest case suggested by\nthe prosecutors was United States v. Boehm—and it hardly could differ more from Mr. Epstein’s\ncase. In Boehm, the defendant was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine\nbase to minors, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), and 859(a); being a felon in\npossession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1); and sex trafficking of children in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 1591. United States v. Boehm, Case No. 3:04CR00003 (D.\nAlaska 2004). Boehm’s actions, unlike Mr. Epstein’s, also had a strong interstate nexus: Boehm\npurchased and distributed large quantities of crack cocaine and cocaine that traveled in interstate\ncommerce, and he used his home and hotels (which were used by interstate travelers) to purchase\ndrugs and distribute them to minors while also arranging for these minors to have sex with him\nand others. Indeed, Boehm not only (1) purchased cocaine in large quantities; (2) distributed the\ndrugs to minors; (3) possessed illegal firearms; (4) and arranged for the minors to have sex with\nother members of the conspiracy in exchange for drugs; but (5) admitted to knowing the ages of\nthe individuals involved.4 Here, by contrast, as previous stated, all of the conduct took place in\nMr. Epstein’s private home in Palm Beach; there was no for-profit enterprise; no interstate\ncomponent; no use by Mr. Epstein of an instrumentality of interstate commerce; no violence; no\nforce; no alcohol; no drugs; no guns; and no child pornography.\n\n3 See http /Iwww.bishop-accountability.org/reports/2004_02_27_JohnJay/2004_02_27 Terry_JohnJay_3.htm\n#cleric7.\n\n4 In fact, Boehm and his co-defendants distributed drugs to approximately 12 persons between the ages of 13 and\n21. Boehm also had a prior criminal history—and one that clearly showed he was a danger to society: he\n\npreviously had been convicted of raping both a thirteen year-old girl and a fifteen year-old girl. (Day 7 of\nSentencing hearing p. 32).\n\n13\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012154",
