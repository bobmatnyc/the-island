  "text": "area. In addition, Myanmar is in a critical geographic position\nfor China’s economic concerns. President Xi has the Belt and\nRoad Initiative, this far reaching strategy to build\ninfrastructure across Asia and into Africa and even Eastern\nEurope. And Myanmar plays a critical position potentially for\nan oil or energy pipeline that would allow China to get\nresources from the Middle East and avoid the bottleneck in\nthe Straits of Malacca. For all of these reasons, China would\nsupport the Myanmar government.\n\nHost: Robert, is China’s support strengthened by opposition\nfrom Washington where President Trump’s administration is\ncalling for Rohingya refugees to return to safe zones?\n\nRLK: | don’t think that’s a big motivation for China. Far more\nimportant are local geopolitics, the Belt and Road Initiative,\nthe potential energy pipeline. I don’t think China considers\nopposing Washington a major motivator for their strategy.\nU.S. comments seem normal for these situations, but are fairly\nineffectual - look at Crimea or other places in the world\nwhere similar situations have occurred.\n\nRLK: Refugee crises are great tragedies for the world and it\nseems like we have more of them. There’s more of a desire for\nindividual groups of people to assert their own independence.\nWe see it in the Kurds, South Sudan, many places in the world.\nPerhaps it’s our interconnected world of 24-hour-a-day\ninternet, which allows similar people to congregate together\nand take up their own personal interests. So it’s a very\ncomplex situation. China is dealing with it - for the reasons |\nsaid - for what it believes to be in its own interests.\n\nHost: Robert Lawrence Kuhn, thank you very much for\njoining us from Beijing. We appreciate your insights.\n\nT= Local Time 20:13\n\nROHINGYA REFUGEE CRISIS\nUN: Rohingya Muslims facing humanitarian catastrophe\n\nEIGN WORLD NEWS 3s ” ROHINGYA MUSLIMS RESPOND TO CLAIMS THE\nw,.!\n\nROHINGYA REFUGEE CRISIS\nMyanmar's army denies targeting civilians\nEIGIS WORLD NEWS 4g] DOW 22158.18\n\nNASDAQ 6460.19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033254",
