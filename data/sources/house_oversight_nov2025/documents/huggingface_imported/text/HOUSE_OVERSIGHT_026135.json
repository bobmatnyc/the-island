GDP, which declined from its\npeak of US$183 billion in 2013 to US$90 billion in 2015, is now recovering at a\ngrowth above 2% and is expected to grow at 3.2% in 2018. Growth is projected at\n3.5%-4% in the medium term (IMF).\n\nThe current account deficit fell sharply, from over 9% of GDP in 2013 to 3.6% of\nGDP in 2016 and reserves-while still low-have more than doubled to US$17.6\nbillion (end of 2017 target at US$21.3 billion). The overall fiscal deficit-including\nthe energy sector’s quasi-fiscal losses, which had increased to 10 percent of GDP\nin 2014, declined to 2.3% of GDP in 2016, supported by strong spending control\nand the decision to raise energy tariffs to market levels.\n\nInflation has fallen steadily from its peak of 61% in April 2015 to 12.4% by end-\n2016, well within the target range of the NBU. It is projected to reach 9% in 2017\nand 5% in the medium term.\n\nUkraine has entered into a 4-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with IMF in\nMarch 2015 for US$17.5 billion. Following the third review by IMF the fourth\ntranche of US$1 billion was approved which would bring total disbursements\nunder the arrangement to about US$8.38 billion. The EFF aims to put the economy\non the path to recovery, restore external sustainability, strengthen public finances,\nmaintain financial stability, and support economic growth by advancing structural\nand governance reforms, while protecting the most vulnerable.\n\nThe Ukrainian administration showed commitment to reforms by nationalising the\nlargest private bank, Privatbank, and liquidating over 100 banks within 3 years.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026135",
