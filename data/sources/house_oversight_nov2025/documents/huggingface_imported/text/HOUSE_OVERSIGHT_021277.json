He has\ninterests in the relation of the social sciences to\nreligious ethics for the purpose of addressing\nvarious challenges facing modern life. His books\ninclude Generative Man (1973, 1975; National\nBook Award Finalist, 1974), Religious Thought\nand the Modern Psychologies (1987, 2004), the\nco-authored From Culture Wars to Common\nGround: Religion and the American Family\nDebate (1997, 2000), Christian Ethics and the\nMoral Psychologies (2006), and Equality and the\nFamily (2007). He co-edited Sex, Marriage, and\nFamily in the World Religions (2006), American\nReligions and the Family (2006), Children and\nChildhood in American Religions (2009), and\nChildren and Childhood in World Religions\n(2009). He is the co-principal investigator with\nJean Bethke Elshtain of a Templeton Foundation\nfunded $4,000,000 New Science of Virtue\nproject.\n\nIn this essay, Browning acknowledges\nthe antagonistic relationship that can be found\nbetween science and religion, but he proposes\nthat the dialogue between science and religion\ncan now be conducted on philosophical grounds\nthat promote a new religious humanism that will\nhonor the core ideas of the great religions, refine\ntheir view of nature, and increase the values of\nhealth, wealth, education, and general well-\nbeing.\n\nPage |31\n\nyears, new energy and fresh public\ninterest have been injected into this\nconversation. This largely has come\nabout due to the new insights into\nreligion and ethics achieved by\ncollaboration between evolutionary\npsychology and cognitive and social\nneuroscience.\n\nWhat are the likely social\nconsequences of this new interest in the\nrelation of science and religion? There\nare at least three possible answers. One\nmight be the new atheism exemplified\nby the writings of Richard Dawkins,\nDaniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and\nChristopher Hitchens. In this approach,\nthe alleged defective thinking of the\nworld religions is exposed, and a\nworldview and way of life based strictly\non science are offered as replacement. A\nsecond option might be the return of a\nhegemonic dominance of religion over\nscience. However, polarizing rhetoric\nfrom advocates for the exclusive\ninterpretive priority of either science or\nreligion has long since ceased to be\nculturally or academically productive.\nInstead, through dialogue about common\nissues, scientific and theological thinkers\nmay pose questions that lead to more\nsophisticated inquiry in both fields.\n\nConfidence in the productive\npossibilities of reciprocal questioning is\na hallmark of the long tradition known\nas religious humanism. Here I illustrate\nthe potential contribution of religious\nhumanism by bringing recent\npsychological research into dialogue\nwith the religious concept of love.\n\nWhat would this religious\nhumanism be like? The major world\nreligions would remain visible and\nviable as religious movements. But the\ncontributions of science would help\nthese religions refine their interests in\nimproving the health, education, wealth,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021277",
