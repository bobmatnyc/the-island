In\nExhibit 21, we compare the five-year annualized\nexpected total returns published in our 2013\nOutlook to what transpired over the last four\nyears. Our forecasts for 1) fixed income returns\nincluding both investment grade and high yield,\n\n2) hedge fund returns, and 3) EAFE equity returns\nwere close to the mark. Directionally, we were\n\nalso right about US equity returns but off in terms\nof magnitude. We were also struck by how close\nour US bank sector return forecasts were to the\nrealized returns—approximately a quarter of which\nwere realized after the November election. This\nobservation has reinforced our belief in one of the\npillars of our investment philosophy: having the\nappropriate horizon for various strategies is critical\nto long-term success.\n\nNot surprisingly, we have not been right\nacross the board. We underestimated Japanese\nequity returns by 11.4 percentage points on an\nannualized basis and we overestimated emerging\nmarket equity and emerging market local debt\nreturns, by sizable 13.5 and 12.1 percentage\npoints, respectively, on an annualized basis.\nJapanese equities realized an annualized 18%\nreturn and EM equity and local debt realized\nnegative returns, at -2% and -5% annualized,\nrespectively. While our forecasts were off\nthe mark, our emerging market investment\nrecommendations were on the mark.
