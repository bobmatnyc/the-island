  "text": "Turkey, a member of the NATO alliance, hosts American troops\nand warplanes at Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for\nthe U.S.-led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAt a news conference in Washington, Weingarten and Michael\nMiller, another Steptoe attorney, said evidence from a 2015\ncase financed by the Turkish government against Gulen in U.S.\nfederal court in Pennsylvania showed that the Turkish\ngovernment relies on dubious proof to make its case against\nhim.\n\nThat case alleged Gulen issued coded orders to followers in the\nTurkish judiciary in a 2009 sermon to persecute members of\nanother religious sect. It also alleged that the script of a popular\nTurkish television show was laced with follow-up messages.\nThe case was dismissed by a judge in June.\n\nTurkish government officials, however, say such evidence is\nvalid because Gulen operates covertly and sends encoded\nmessages to his followers.\n\nTurkey has sent the United States new documents in recent\ndays containing evidence that Turkish authorities say proves the\ncleric was behind the attempted coup. U.S. officials say they are\nlooking through them.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Harte; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and\nJames Dalgleish)\n\nFrom: Keough, Michael [mailto : i |\n\nSent: Friday, August 05, 2016 1:10 PM\n\nTo: Will Bohlen i i e; King, Kathryn <i Miller, Michael\nSE; K2telyn Woh ford <>; Y.
