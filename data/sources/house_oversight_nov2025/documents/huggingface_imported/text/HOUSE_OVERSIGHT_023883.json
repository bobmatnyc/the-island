  "text": "CHAPTER 10\n\ni\n\nMZ\n\nDefining Intelligence\n\nAll our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to\nthe understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing\nhigher than reason.\n\n—Immanuel Kant\n\nWhat is school for? A common answer is, to make people more knowl-\nedgeable. Another is, to socialize them and prepare them for living\nwith others. Another is, to make them ready for work. (This last one\nseems almost laughable because it is clearly untrue in the modern\nworld, but people do seem to still believe it.) Another is, to prepare\nthem for more school. (People take this one very seriously.) My answer\nis: School should make people more intelligent.\n\nReally? Can we make people more intelligent? There are those\nwho would argue, and I am quite sure they are right, that intelligence\nis genetic: It can’t be altered by school, one way or the other.\n\nNevertheless, I think that school should make students more\nintelligent.\n\nHow can I believe both things?\n\nIt all depends on how you define intelligence. Let’s think about in-\ntelligence the way ordinary people define it when they say that some-\none seems dumb or that someone seems to be very smart. There is a\nlot to be learned by considering seriously the folk view of intelligence\nas opposed to the classical school/testing view.\n\nIn the 2007 Miss Teen USA contest, Miss South Carolina responded\nto this question:\n\n“Recent polls have shown that a fifth of Americans can’t locate\nthe United States on a world map. Why do you think this is?”\n\n137\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023883",
