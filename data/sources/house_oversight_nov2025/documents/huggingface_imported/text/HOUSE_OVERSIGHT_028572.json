  "text": "14 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting\n\nSee H.R. Rep. No. 1208, at 1. That multilateralism is\nthreatened if one nation alone, through application of its\nown liability rules (by nonexpert judges), can shape the\npolicy choices or actions that an international organization\nbelieves it must take or refrain from taking. Yet that is\nthe effect. of the majority’s interpretation. By restricting\nthe immunity that international organizations enjoy, it\n“opens the door to divided decisions of the courts of differ-\nent member states,” including U. 8. courts, “passing judg-\nment on the rules, regulations, and decisions of the inter-\nnational bodies.” Broadbent v. Organization of Am. States,\n628 F. 2d 27, 35 (CADC 1980); cf. Singer, Jurisdictional\nImmunity of International Organizations: Human Rights\nand Functional Necessity Concerns, 36 Va. J. Intl L. 58,\n63-64 (1995) (recognizing that “[i]t would be inappropriate\nfor municipal courts to cut deep into the region of autono-\nmous decision-making authority of institutions such as the\nWorld Bank”).\n\nMany international organizations, fully aware of their\nmoral (if not legal) obligations to prevent harm to others\nand to compensate individuals when they do cause harm,\nhave sought to fulfill those obligations without compromis-\ning their ability to operate effectively. Some, as I have\nsaid, waive their immunity in U.S. courts at least in part.\nAnd the D. C. Circuit, for nearly 40 years, has interpreted\nthose waivers in a way that protects the organization\nagainst interference by any single state. See, e.g.,\nMendaro, 717 F. 2d, at 615. The D.C. Circuit allows a\nlawsuit to proceed when “insistence on immunity would\nactually prevent or hinder the organization from conduct-\ning its activities.” J/d., at 617. Thus, a direct beneficiary of\na World Bank loan can generally sue the Bank, because\n“the commercial reliability of the Bank’s direct loans ...\nwould be significantly vitiated” if “beneficiaries were\nrequired to accept the Bank’s obligations without recourse\nto judicial process.” Id., at 618.
