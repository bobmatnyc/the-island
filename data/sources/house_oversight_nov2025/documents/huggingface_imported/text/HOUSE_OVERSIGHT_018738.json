  "text": "Tenant Overview\n\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS” or “CIS\") is a component of the\nUnited States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which in turn is under the General Services\nAdministration (GSA). It performs many administrative functions formerly carried out by the former United\nStates Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which was part of the Department of Justice. —\n\nThe stated priorities of the USCIS are to promote national security, to eliminate immigration case backlogs,\nand to improve customer services. USCIS is headed by a director, currently Leon Rodriquez, who reports\ndirectly to the Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security. USCIS consists of 18,000 federal employees and\ncontractors working at 250 offices around the world.\n\nUSCIS is charged with processing immigrant visa petitions, naturalization petitions, and asylum and refugee\napplications, as well as making adjudicative decisions performed at the service centers, and managing all\nother immigration benefits functions (i.e., not immigration enforcement).\n\nUSCIS’ official website is USCIS.gov which includes an online appointment scheduling service known as\nINFOPASS. This system allows people with questions about immigration to come into their local USCIS\nd\nit\n\noffice and speak directly with a government employee about their case. Additionally, USCIS maintains a\nblog entitled “The Beacon” as well as the “@uscis” Twitter account.\n\nUnlike most other federal agencies, USCIS is funded almost entirely by user fees. Under President George\nW. Bush's FY2008 budget request, direct congressional appropriations made about 1% of the USCIS budget\nand about 99% of the budget was funded through fees. The total USCIS FY2008 budget was projected to\nbe $2.6 billion.\n\nno\n\n\\ U.S. Citizenship\nand Immigration\n\nExceptional Credit Tenancy - i~< * Services\nBoasting an “AA+\" credit rating by S&P and an “Aaa” credit rating by Moody’s, the lease is guaranteed by\nthe United States of America.\n\nHigh Renewal Probability -\nThe General Services Administration’s lease renewal probability is 96% in new, first generation space such\nas the Property, and the GSA remains in its space for over 25 years on average.\n\nUS CITIZENSHIP\nAND IMMIGRATION\nSERVICES\n\nPage 12 GSA Investment & Acquisition Opportunity | St Thomas, USVI ee) Stan Johnson Company | THE NET LEASE AUTHORITY®\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018738",
