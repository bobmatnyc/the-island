  "text": "“rotation” with Yitzhak Shamir, so that\nhe could be in the government. He\nproposed the ideal of “national unity,”\nand greatly devalued the democratic\nconcept of parliamentary opposition.\nFormer Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni\nruined her reputation when she refused to\njoin Netanyahu in his last government.\nWhile it is quite true that Livni was an\nineffective opposition leader, it is the\nvery fact of her refusal to join the\nadministration and “influence it from\nwithin” that has provoked most of the\ncriticism by Israeli political\ncommentators. Similar criticism is\ncurrently being leveled at Labor Party\nleader Shelly Yachimovich for stating\nclearly that she would not join\nNetanyahu’s next government, but would\nserve as leader of the opposition. There\nare certainly many reasons to criticize\nYachimovich, but not her eminently\ndemocratic decision to lead the\nparliamentary opposition. Very few of\nour political commentators have ever\nexpressed respect or even understanding\nfor the concept of opposition. The most\npopular political idea in Israel today is\nnational unity—better still, a National\nUnity Government: “We should all rally\nround the flag and support our\ngovernment in these critical times.” This\nposition, widely espoused, echoes what\nPeres has said repeatedly over the years.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029795",
