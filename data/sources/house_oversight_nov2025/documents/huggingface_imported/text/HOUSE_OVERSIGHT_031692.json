A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner\n\nThis was just a few months after he finished his prison obligations in Florida.\nAnd here he is, entertaining --- with children present.\n\nThis Break Fast is one of a number of social events involving post-prison Jeffrey that attracted celebrated, powerful people.\nOf course I have zero idea who said, \"NO WAY\" and didn't cross his doorway.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) I You have known him for decades, were/are friends, etc.\n\nWhy was your reaction to his crimes to continue being his friend --- and not in a covert way?\n2) What would he have had to do for you to shun him --- to cut him out of your life?\n\nYou're the ultimate professional; you may not want to respond.\n\nEspecially because I'm NOT reaching out to anyone else who's named in the piece.\n\nI don't care about them.\n\nBut it ain't me to blindside you.\n\nJK\n\nOn Apr 30, 2011, at 4:03 PM, Peggy Siegal wrote:\n\nWould love to talk to you.
