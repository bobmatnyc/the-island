  "text": "collapse from within. But the opposite\nis true!\n\nWe have no intention of collapsing\nfrom within. But this requires that we\ncome to our senses and act with the\nright national priorities in mind for\nsociety and the economy.\n\n¢ The young generation, the\nfuture, must be prioritized. And the\nsame applies to those groups in society\nwho carry its burdens:working hard,\npaying taxes and serving in the IDF.\nCultivating mutual respect, openness,\ntolerance, and acceptance of others;\nMore equitable distribution of the\nnational wealth; equal opportunities for\nall and encouraging individuals,\ngroups and communities to take\nresponsibility. All of these are part of\nour mission — and we have a long road\nahead of us.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029383",
