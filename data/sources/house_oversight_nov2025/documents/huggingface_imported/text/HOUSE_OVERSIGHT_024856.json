This has been reflected in\nconsistent strong growth from MNST'’s Ultra line, which offers functional benefits\nwithout the sugar, Muscle Monster, which is high in protein, as well as the emergence of\nBang, which contains BCAA. At their recent Analyst Day, MNST indicated that they will\nbe launching a new product called Reign, which will offer 5x the amount of BCAA as\nBang. As the lines between core energy drinks and health and wellness offerings\ncontinue to blur, we would expect all of the major players to come to market with\nofferings that contain CBD and provide incremental functional benefits (such as muscle\nrecovery).\n\nWe believe that by 2020 it is reasonable for CBD’s share of the energy category to reach\n~1%, which we view as conservative as it is below the current market share run rate that\nBang has already been able to achieve. A 1% share would imply revenues of ~$180 mm\nfor the CBD segment, assuming that the category continues to grow at the same 4.3%\nCAGR it has delivered over the past three years. We can see below that implied category\nrevenues for total energy would grow by over $1 bn over the next two years to ~$17 bn.\n\nFigure 63 Almost $200 MM In Revenues Assuming 1% Share By 2020 Figure 64 Extrapolating 4.3% CAGR Results In Category Revenues\n\nSurpassing $17 BN In 2 Years\n\nU.S. CBD Energy Drink Sales ($ in mm)\n\n$200\n\n$150\n\n$100\n\n$50\n\n0)\n2018\n\n2019E\n\nU.S. Energy Drink Sales ($ in bn)\n\n$180 $18 $165 S16 ca\n$16 S44 $14 $15 BY |\nS44 I\n$12 I\n$10 l\n$8 |\n$6 I\n$4 I\n$2 ,\n$0\n2020E 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019E 2020F\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nSource: The Nielsen Company and Cowen and Company\nNote: Assumes 75% coverage in Nielsen\n\nBelow we provide a scenario analysis on CBD energy revenues associated with market\nshare gains. We would note that a 0.3% share by 2020 would be at the low-end of our\nexpectations and result in revenues of ~$50 mm. As a point of reference, recall that\nMutant, which did not perform to expectations and has essentially been de-prioritized by\nMNST, has a current market share of ~0.2%.\n\nFigure 65 Blurred Lines Between Core Energy And H&W Make CBD Ripe For Entry Into Category\n\n2020 Market Share Scenario Analysis\n\nMarket Share 0.3% 0.6% 0.8% | 1.1% 13% 1.6% 18%\n\nAbsolute Sales (S$inmm)| $52 $95 $137 $223 $265 $308\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024856",
