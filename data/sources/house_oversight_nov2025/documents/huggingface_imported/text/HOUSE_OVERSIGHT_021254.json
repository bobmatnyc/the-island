  "text": "The science of the mind is not\nunique in this regard. As the historian\nDaniel Boorstin (1983, /) noted:\n\nNothing could be more obvious\nthan that the earth is stable and\nunmoving, and that we are the\ncenter of the universe. Modern\nWestern science takes its\nbeginning from the denial of this\ncommonsense axiom...\nCommon sense, the foundation\nof everyday life, could no longer\nserve for the governance of the\nworld. When “scientific”\nknowledge, the sophisticated\nproduct of complicated\ninstruments and subtle\ncalculations, provided\nunimpeachable truths, things\nwere no longer as they seemed.”\n\n(p. 294)\n\nAnd just as the observation that we roam\non stable ground led to the incorrect\ninference that we are the center of the\nuniverse, so too is the modern notion\nthat the human brain is a solitary,\nautonomous instrument whose\nconnections with other brains is a matter\nof deliberate choice and of no real\nimport.\n\nThe human brain, the organ of\nthe mind, is housed deep within the\ncranial vault, where it is protected and\nisolated from others, so it may seem\nobvious that the brain is a solitary\ninformation processing device that has\nno special means of connecting with\nother brains. But we are fundamentally\na social species. Faces, expressive\ndisplays, and human speech receive\npreferential processing in neonate as\nwell as adult brains. When a person\nfeels rejected by others, their brain\nshows the same pattern of activation as\nwhen they are exposed to a physically\n\npainful stimulus. Permit a person to\ncooperate with others, and their brain\nshows the same pattern of activation as\nwhen they are given a rich reward such\nas delicious food or drink. We may not\nbe aware of it, but human evolution has\nsculpted a human need for social\nconnection, along with neural circuits\nand hormonal processes that enable and\npromote communication and connection\nacross brains. As we shall see in the\nchapters to follow, our sociality is an\nimportant part of who we are as a\nspecies and it plays an important though\noften invisible role in the operations of\nour brain and our biology. Among the\nquestions we examine is whether our\nsocial brain also contributes to the\nubiquitous human quest for spirituality.\n\nThe Chicago Social Brain Network\n\nFor hundreds of years, theology\nand philosophy were the hub disciplines\nof scholarship, and other fields of\ninquiry orbited around this dyad and\nwere tightly constrained by it. Over the\npast three centuries, the sciences have\ncome into their own, displacing theology\nand philosophy at the center of the\nacademic universe. In so doing, they\nhave produced extraordinary advances in\neveryday life. People may reminisce\nabout the good old days, but thanks to\nscience and technology the amount of\ntotal income spent on the necessities of\nfood, clothing, and shelter dropped from\n80% in 1901 to 50% in 2002/2003. Yet\nthere remains an inchoate sense that\nsomething is missing in our lives,\nsomething intangible and elusive.\nScience has improved our material lives,\nbut improvements in material life may\nnot be enough to optimize human well\nbeing.\n\nCan these two very different\nways of seeing the world be used\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021254",
