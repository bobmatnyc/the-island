  "text": "/ BARAK / 130\n\nup in our inner Group of Eight discussions, I could usually count only on Dan\nMeridor, and occasionally a handful of others, to argue in favor of any form of\ninitiative on our side. In private meetings, Bibi did sometimes engage in discussion\nabout what Israel might do. But he invariably steered the conversation elsewhere,\ninsisting that the real issue was the Palestinians’ lack of any interest in making\npeace.\n\nMy main worry wasn’t the immediate future of the negotiations. For now, the\nchances of an agreement seemed close to zero. It was the longer-term damage\nBibi’s approach would do in further delaying any serious move by Israel to put our\nrelations with the Palestinians on a more stable and sustainable footing. The\ndithering, delay and deadlock suited him politically. Ironically, my own efforts on\nthe security front had also made it easier for us to do next to nothing. Intermittent\noutbreaks of violence always remained a threat. Yet the West Bank security fence,\nalong with our military, police and intelligence measures, meant it was very\nunlikely we’d see a return to the full-blown terror war of the second intifada. I was\nalso working to secure US support for our development of increasingly effective\nanti-missile weapons to reduce the threat from Hamas in Gaza. The overall result\nwas that for many, if not most, Israelis, the conflict with the Palestinians didn’t\nimpact on their day-to-day lives. It was unseen and largely unfelt.\n\nStill, the effect of the stalemate on our relationship with Washington did matter:\nboth for our security cooperation on things like the anti-missile weapons and,\ncrucially, the challenge which had led me into Bibi’s government in the first place:\nkeeping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n\nIt was a race against time. The Iranians were producing more and more\nyellowcake, building more advanced centrifuges, accumulating more low-enriched\nuranium. They were getting better at hiding and protecting the network of facilities\nbeing used to try to produce a nuclear weapon. And in the early months of Bibi’s\nPrime Ministership, the question we faced wasn’t even whether to take military\naction against Iran — something I knew, from Bob Gates and others, that the\nObama administration viewed no more favourably than George W. Bush. It was\n\n416\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028264",
