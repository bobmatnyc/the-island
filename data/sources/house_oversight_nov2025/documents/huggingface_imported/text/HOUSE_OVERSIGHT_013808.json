  "text": "A for Automation puts cash flow on autopilot using geographic arbitrage, outsourcing, and rules of\nnondecision. From bracketing to the routines of ultrasuccessful NR, it’s all here. This section provides\nthe second ingredient of luxury lifestyle design: income.\n\nL for Liberation is the mobile manifesto for the globally inclined. The concept of mini-retirements is\nintroduced, as are the means for flawless remote control and escaping the boss. Liberation is not about\ncheap travel; it is about forever breaking the bonds that confine you to a single location. This section\ndelivers the third and final ingredient for luxury lifestyle design: mobility.\n\nI should note that most bosses are less than pleased if you spend one hour in the office each day, and\nemployees should therefore read the steps in the entrepreneurially minded DEAL order but implement\nthem as DELA. If you decide to remain in your current job, it is necessary to create freedom of location\nbefore you cut your work hours by 80%. Even if you have never considered becoming an entrepreneur in\nthe modern sense, the DEAL process will turn you into an entrepreneur in the purer sense as first coined\nby French economist J. B. Say in 1800—one who shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and\ninto an area of higher yield.\n\nLast but not least, much of what I recommend will seem impossible and even offensive to basic\ncommon sense—I expect that. Resolve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking. If you\ntry it, you'll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won’t ever go back.\n\nTake a deep breath and let me show you my world. And remember—tranquilo. It’s time to have fun\nand let the rest follow.\n\nTIM FERRISS\n\nTokyo, Japan\nSeptember 29, 2006\n\n1. Uncommon terms are defined throughout this book as concepts are introduced.
