  "text": "North Korea has set off a third nuclear test explosion. It has done so in\ndefiance of the UN, America, Japan and even, reportedly, its sponsor,\nChina. It has said to hell with everyone, in a brutal comment on western\neconomic sanctions.\n\nThe UN security council met yesterday and Washington threatened\n\"significant consequences\" — code nowadays for \"tighter sanctions\". Every\nshred of evidence suggests that these will not achieve the declared goal.\nThey will merely add to the impoverishment of North Korea's people by\nits own government. Sanctions are the most counter-productive tool\nknown to diplomacy. Yet we keep imposing them. Why’?\n\nSanctions assume that all countries react to external pressure as might a\ncapitalist democracy. They assume a misguided regime will change its\nmind and put financial advantage above its definition of national interest.\n\"Smart sanctions\" (really dumb sanctions) further assume the rich can be\npunished without punishing the poor, and that all dictators' wives want to\nfly abroad and shop at Harrods. They assume that trade guides political\naction and political action trumps dictatorship.\n\nEconomic sanctions are hugely popular to western politicians, not because\nof their effect but because of their cause: the desire to stand on an\ninternational stage and being seen to \"do something\". They are the least-\ncost first resort of the laptop bombardiers of global intervention. They\nsound punitive and aggressive without inflicting any hardship on the\nimposer.\n\nAfter North Korea the other target in the sanctions frame is Iran.\nEverything at present suggests that ever-tighter sanctions have done\nnothing to curb Iran's nuclear programme. Indeed, by inducing paranoia,\nprobably the reverse. Sanctions have certainly \"bitten\", to the glee of their\nadvocates. They have brought inflation and a collapse in the currency, the\nrial. They have harmed ordinary people and solidified sentiment against\nthe west and the \"great Satan\" of the US. Assassination and cyber-\nweapons have wiped out a few scientists and scrambled a few computers.\n\nWhat sanctions have not done is weakened the power of the ayatollahs or\ntheir private army, the Revolutionary Guards. Both seem as secure as ever,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028651",
