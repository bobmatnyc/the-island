As shown below, there is a significant\nchange in return for every $1 change in price per CBD%. A deterioration of this pricing\nwith no corresponding change in cost would impact CBD production. Breakeven for the\nmodel above is ~$9/Ib for dry matter yield compared to the $30/Ib used to calculate the\nmargin over variable cost per acre used. While price % CBD can fluctuate, the second\nfactor determining the dry matter yield/Ib price is CBD%.\n\nFigure 5 - Sensitivity Analysis\n\nPrice per% CBD Total Revenue Returns Above Variable Costs\n\n$43,200\n$36,000\n\n$28,800\n$21,600\n$14,400\n$7,200\n\nSource: hemp.ca.uky.edu, Cowen and Company\n\nCBD Hemp Clearly An Attractive Option For Growers. No other crop in the U.S. offers\nthe type of return of the CBD Plasticulture Model. We would expect the two largest\ncrops in the U.S.: corn and soybeans to lose some acreage to CBD hemp, though given\ncorn and soybean area planted was 89.1M and 89.2M acres respectively in 2018. (Total\nplanted acres in the U.S. is ~320M acres.)\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024830",
