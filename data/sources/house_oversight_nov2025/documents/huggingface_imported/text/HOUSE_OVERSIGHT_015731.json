  "text": "Determinism\n\nhave free will.\n] Look...\n\nI can choose to type any word I like.\n\nGiotto...\n\nMany philosophers tell me I am deluded. I was always going to type\nthat word and I have no free will. Everything in my life is predetermined.\nI’m rather like a character in an enormous video game. The character\nmight think it was free to act, and its actions would appear random.\nYet from the moment the player clicked the button to start the game,\nevery action the character takes is determined by a preprogrammed set\nof rules. This is the free will debate. How can we tell we are free? Would\nthere be any observable effect?\n\nOne of the big problems is that philosophers codified much of our\nmodern theory of free will in the 19\" century, at a time when all the\nknown physical laws were deterministic and reversible. They could not\nsee a way for free will to emerge from such physical laws. There was even\na group called the Compatibilists lead by David Hume that thought free\nwill could coexist with determinism. Provided you felt free it did not\nmatter that your actions were inevitable.\n\nWe all want free will to mean actual freedom to make conscious\nchoices. We would like to affect the world in which we live; not the other\nway around. I dislike making definitions — I find they take away from the\ncore argument and only result in linguistic jousting, but it seems that two\ncenturies of philosophers have avoided a proper discussion of free will by\nloosely defining the term. Here is my definition:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015731",
