Such recalls may result in financial burdens and reputational\nharm and may subject cannabis companies to increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\n* Consumer perception of cannabis products can be significantly influenced by scientific research\nor findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding\nthe consumption of cannabis. Any unfavorable developments in these areas could have a material\nadverse effect on the demand for cannabis products in general or on the products or prospects of\na particular company.\n\nRisks Related to Early-Stage Cannabis Companies\n\n* Most cannabis companies are in early stages of development and have limited operational his-\ntory, so it is difficult to accurately predict and forecast their business operations. Many cannabis\ncompanies will fail.\n\n¢ The success of many early-stage cannabis companies is premised on receiving and maintaining\nthe licenses, permits and regulatory approvals required for their proposed cannabis activities.\nMany of such companies will not receive or maintain such licenses, permits and approvals or may\nbe able to do so only at significant expense.\n\n* Cannabis companies’ access to the capital required to grow and to finance ongoing operations\ninvolves challenges particular to the industry's uncertain and rapidly evolving legal landscape.\nMany early-stage companies in the cannabis industry will not be able to obtain the requisite\ncapital or will run out of capital prior to reaching profitability.\n\n° Early-stage cannabis companies may experience unexpected problems in the areas of product\ndevelopment and quality, manufacturing, marketing and general management, which, in some\ncases, cannot be adequately solved. Companies may also be subject to product pricing and cost\npressures and to claims of intellectual property infringement.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 167\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024803",
