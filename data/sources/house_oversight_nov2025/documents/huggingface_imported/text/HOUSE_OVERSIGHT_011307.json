So we were trying to streamline\n\nthe case to the statements about Maxwell and her involvement\n\nwith Epstein.\nSo in the omnibus motion you'll see, for example, that\n\nthey have claimed she's made statements about other\n\nindividuals, and we say that that's not what's at issue, what's\n\nat issue are the statements\n\n=\n\nTHE COURT: That may be an issue of credibility. That\n\nmay be an issue of credibility. I'm talking about what we're\n\ngoing to go to the jury on.\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Yes. And that is the statements that\nMaxwell made about my client.\n\nTHE COURT: And that's it.\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Yes, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: Let me ask the defense.

MENNINGER: Your Honor, I think it's slightly more\n\nnuanced. Plaintiff has claimed our client's statement is\n\nfalse. Our client's statement is not just limited to the\n\nlittle snippets that they included in their complaint, it's the\n\nntire statement. That entire statement talks about Virginia\nGiuffre's allegations against Ms. Maxwell have been proven\n\nuntrue.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011307",
