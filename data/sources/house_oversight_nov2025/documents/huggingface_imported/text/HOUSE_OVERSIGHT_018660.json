  "text": "chemical thing. My body will crave him beyond words, even if my brain knows he's a\nterrible idea.\n\nI once heard about a woman who won't allow herself to have orgasms during casual sex,\nbecause she knows the orgasm itself will bond her to her partner. I don't experience\norgasms that way. But when a partner really puts me under with S&M, pulls me in deep,\nand then he gives me aftercare while I surface? That's where I fall in love.\n\nI've heard of polyamorous S&M relationships in which the primary relationship disallows\nS&M with non-primary partners. I can certainly understand wanting to reserve that for\nthe primary relationship. I've also heard of polyamorous S&M relationships in which the\npartners can do S&M with outside partners... but won't allow aftercare with outside\npartners. I can understand that even better.\n\nte Ok ok\nBrainwashing: Intimacy Within Abuse\n\nIn late 2010, I cross-posted an article about an intense S&M experience to the blog\nFeministe. In the article, I included these words:\n\nThere it was. I felt the tears building, gasps torn from my throat, I felt myself starting to\nfall apart and reform: around him, around his guidance and force and demands. Almost\nunable to think. Until finally he relented and said my name, and said softly, \"Come\nback,\" and ran his hand reassuringly down my hair.\n\nThere it was: the reason I want it so much.\n\nIn response, a commenter named FormerWildChild wrote:\n\nFor some of us, the idea of being hit by another person makes us want to jump up and\nrun out of our skin. It seriously wigs us out. It is not a moral judgment; is a true phobia\nfor another person. It reminds me of when we were at the un-civilized end of Grand\nCanyon with our children. All that stood between my kids and certain death was inches\nof loosely packed sand. When we were done sightseeing, I discreetly walked behind the\nvan and threw up until I could breathe again.\n\nI had that same terrified feeling when I read about your account of your last session. I\nwanted to go wrap a blanket around you, hold you in my arms and feed you tea and\ncookies until I can finally breathe again.\n\nAnd my fear is not because I fail to really \"get\" what you experience. It comes from an\nabsolute recognition of what you describe.\n\nI have experienced what you described at the end of your BDSM session, the breaking\nand reforming of yourself around someone. I have felt exactly what you are talking\nabout, that feeling of finally letting go, of surrendering, and the other person sensing that\nyou are finally there, and then stopping. I have felt the sweetness of those moments of\npost-thrashing closeness when tenderness seems to hover in the room. I know the feeling\nof intense closeness which can follow the next day. The air is filled with a cathartic\ncleanness, the experience of inflicting pain and of receiving pain has cleared the air\nbetter than any southern thunderstorm. I can even imagine coming to crave that feeling\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018660",
