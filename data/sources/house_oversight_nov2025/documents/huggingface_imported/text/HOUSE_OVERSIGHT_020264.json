  "text": "Liz\n\nhe was the most famous visitor in Hong Kong, his passage through passport control may have\nreflected the acquiescence of the Hong Kong authorities to the reported request of China to be rid\nof Snowden by June 23rd. All we know for certain is that Hong Kong airport police did not stop\nSnowden.\n\nHe was allowed on the Aeroflot flight at Hong Kong International Airport. Aeroflot, a state-\nowned airline, presumably responds to the Russian government when matters of state security are\nconcerned. According to one Aeroflot official, ordinarily all international passengers are required\nto have a valid passport as well as a visa to the country of final destination. Snowden had neither\na valid passport nor a visa. These boarding requirements were waived so that Snowden was able\nto board the flight to Moscow.\n\nSnowden only met Harrison in person on June 23\", the day he was to depart Hong Kong. She\nwas waiting for him in the private car that Jonathan Mann had arranged to take him to the airport\nthat morning. Snowden was dressed in a grey shirt and khaki slacks. Harrison was also casually\ndressed in jeans and flip-flops. She said she chosen this dress style so that they would blend in at\nthe airport with vacationing tourists. As she had financed the trip, she was apparently now calling\nthe shots. Harrison’s concern was that they might be arrested at the airport, so Mann\naccompanied them through passport control. He was able to do this because he bought a ticker\non a cheap international flight. Harrison also gave Mann a phone number to call if they got\narrested. When they finally boarded the flight at 12:45 pm, Harrison effectively became\nSnowden’s second “carer”—a job that would require her presence in Moscow for the next four\nmonths.\n\nOnce the plane took off, Snowden, who had only said a few words in the car, said to her, as\nshe recalled, the first full sentence she had heard from him. It was “I didn’t expect that WikiLeaks\nwas going to send a ninja to get me out.”\n\nMeanwhile, Assange continued creating “distractions,” as he put it. On June 24\", a booking\nwas made for Snowden on the Aeroflot flight to Cuba, and this information was relayed to the\nforeign press organization in Moscow, resulting on over a dozen reporters buying tickets on the\nflight. But Snowden never showed up for the flight. This ruse resulted in these foreign\ncorrespondents flying to Havana. “In some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about\nthat [flight] on open lines to lawyers in the United States,” Assange said. One subsequent piece of\nhis misinformation was that Snowden was flying to Bolivia on the private plane of Bolivian\nPresident Evo Morales (who was then in Moscow for a meeting.) That misinformation had the\ndesired effect. US allies in Europe, including France, Spain and Portugal refused to allow that\nplane to fly through its airspace, forcing the plane to land in Austria. This Assange-inspired\ndistraction caused an international incident but did not change the fact that Snowden was in the\ncustody of Russia.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020264",
