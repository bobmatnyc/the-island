  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n811\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nHanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253, 78\n§.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1288 (1958)).\n\n[52] For purposes of the minimum con-\ntacts inquiry, a distinction is made be-\ntween specific and general jurisdiction.\nSpecific jurisdiction exists when the forum\nexercises jurisdiction over the defendant in\na suit arising out of the defendant’s con-\ntacts with that forum. Metro. Life Ins. 84\nF.3d at 567-68. General jurisdiction is\nbased on the defendant’s general business\ncontacts with the forum; because the de-\nfendant’s contacts are not related to the\nsuit, a considerably higher level of contacts\nis generally required.™ Jd. at 568.\n\n2. Reasonableness\n\n[53] In determining whether the exer-\ncise of personal jurisdiction is reasonable,\na court is to consider:\n\n(1) the burden that the exercise of juris-\n\ndiction will impose on the defendant; (2)\n\nthe interests in the forum state in adju-\n\ndicating the case; ©) the plaintiffs in-\nterest in obtaining convenient and effec-\ntive relief; (4) the interstate judicial\nsystem’s interest in obtaining the most\nefficient resolution of the controversy;\nand (5) the shared interest of the states\nin furthering substantive social policies.\n\nMetro. Life, 84 F.3d at 568 (citing Asahi\nMetal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480\nU.S. 102, 1138-16, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94\nL.Ed.2d 92 (1987)). “These considerations\nsometimes serve to establish the reason-\nableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser show-\ning of minimum contacts than would other-\nwise be required.” Burger King, 471 U.S.\nat 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174.\n\n[54] There obviously are competing\npolicy considerations at play here. In gen-\n\n34. At oral argument, Plaintiffs focused on\nspecific jurisdiction, see Oct. 12, 2004 Tran-\nscript at 44, but Plaintiffs include general\njurisdiction arguments in many of their oppo-\n\neral, “‘great care and reserve should be\nexercised when extending our notions of\npersonal jurisdiction into the international\nfield’” Asahi Metal Indus. 480 U.S. at\n115, 107 8.Ct. 1026 (quoting United States\nv. First Nat'l City Bank, 379 U.S. 378, 404,\n85 S8.Ct. 528, 138 L.Ed.2d 365 (1965) (Har-\nlan, J., dissenting)). “[T]he unique bur-\ndens placed upon one who must defend\noneself in a foreign legal system should\nhave significant weight in assessing the\nreasonableness of stretching the long arm\nof personal jurisdiction over national bor-\nders.” Jd. at 114, 107 S.Ct. 1026. On the\nother hand, “[t]here is some merit ... to\nthe plaintiffs’ argument that no foreign\nterrorist today can fairly assert a lack of\n‘fair warning’ that it could be ‘haled into\ncourt’ in [this forum.]” Beton v. Palestine-\nan  Interrm Self-Government, 310\nF.Supp.2d 172, 178 (D.D.C.2004).\n\nC. Jurisdictional Discovery\n\n[55,56] Plaintiffs urge the Court to\ndeny Defendants’ motions and order juris-\ndictional discovery. In evaluating jurisdic-\ntional motions, district courts enjoy broad\ndiscretion in deciding whether to order\ndiscovery. See, eg., APWU v. Potter, 348\nF.3d 619, 627 (2d Cir.2003) (noting a court\nmay “devis[e] the procedures [to] ferret\nout the facts pertinent to jurisdiction”);\nMarine Midland Bank, N.A. v. Miller, 664\nF.2d 899, 904 (2d Cir.1981) (noting a court\nhas considerable procedural leeway in de-\nciding whether discovery would assist res-\nolution of motion to dismiss for lack of\npersonal jurisdiction); Lehigh Valley In-\ndus. v. Birenbaum, 527 F.2d 87, 938-94 (2d\nCir.1975) (finding no abuse of discretion in\ndenying discovery where the complaint\nfailed to plead sufficient facts to establish\n\nsition briefs, see, e.g., Ashton Opp. to Prince\nMohamed at 22-24; Burnett Opp. to Aljo-\nmaih at 11. The Court considers all argu-\nments.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017876",
