If you\nwanted to improve the logic of the elevator you would need to rip out all\nthe relays and rewire everything from scratch.\n\nTuring’s first imaginary machine was set up in the same way. It\nhad a fixed set of hard-wired logic, a rule book. In order to perform\ndifferent tasks — say addition or multiplication you had to use a different\nrule book. His revolutionary idea was to write a rule book that told\nthe machine to read a soft-wired set of instructions from the tape and\nexecute those instead. He called this a Universal machine since it could\nperform any procedure written on the tape. Today we call this software.\nIt is fair to say Turing was not the first to use this idea. Charles Babbage’s\nanalytical engine could read instructions from cards and execute\ndifferent procedures, but Turing thought through all the ramifications\nof the idea and made it general purpose, giving us the modern science\nof computing. It is easy to build a real Turing machine, but by today’s\nstandards it is a little clumsy; a team in Denmark has built one using\nLego. You can see a link on my website.\n\nVery soon after Turing’s paper was published, a number of people\nproposed better practical implementations. In 1943, John von Neumann\nof Princeton University created the architecture for ENIAC, the first\nstored program computer, developed for the United States Army’s Ballistic\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015913",
