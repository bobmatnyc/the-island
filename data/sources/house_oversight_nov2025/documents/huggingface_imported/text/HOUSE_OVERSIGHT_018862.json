THOMAS - Both Boards of Elections\nin the VIrgin Islands have run afoul of the V.I.\nCode and board policies in the wake of\nTuesday's general election, from which paper\nballots are still being tallied.\nThe V:1. Code requires the boards to count the\nvotes for each candidate within a day of receiving\nballot materials from the polling places:\n''Each board of elections, afIer having received\nall statements, books, lists, papers, vouchers,\nballots, ballot boxes and district register from\neach polling district and polling place in its distric�\nshall convene not later than one day following\nthe receipt thereof and determine the total\nnumber of votes cast in the election district for\neach candidate.\"\n. The law states that the boards must convene\nno later than three days afIer receiving the aforementioned\nmaterials to tally votes for the Board\nof Education and Board of Elections races.\nOn Tuesday, a majority of the votes from all\nraces were cast on electronic machines, and\nresults from those ballots were available within\nhours of the polls closing.\nHowever, widespread diSbUSt of the machines\nled to a spike in the use of paper ballots - more\nthan 4,500\nvote count and, in effect, hampered the boards'\nabilities to comply with the law.\nToday marks the third day since the boards\nreceived all the ballots from the polling sites\nTuesday night.\nThe St. Thomas-St. John Board hopes to fiuish\ncounting the Senate races by the end of the\nday today before moving on to other races,\naccording to board member Lorna Thomas.\nThe St. Croix Board is scheduled to begin\ncounting its 2,781 paper ballots today.\nThomas, who helped on Thursdsy to oversee\nher board's tally of about 600 ballots in the\n..\nISSN 2159-3019\n� Virgin Islands\nD,ily N,w, MiI,h\",\nCom,,,y ,,,.

He said the policy never was put into\nwriting, but it may exist in some fonn in minutes\nfrom the meeting. He also said the policy lacked\nan enforcement mechanism.\nRoss said the intent of the policy, which\npassed by a 6-5 vote, was to ensure that processing\nof the paper ballots began as soon as possible.\nThe sooner the counting begins, the easier it\nis to comply with another section of the law that\nrequires the boards to certify a fiual vote count\nwithin 10 days of an election, Ross reasoned.\nThe certification deadline already was weighing\non the mind of Thomas, who pointed out the\nSt. Thomas-St. John Board has yet to louch\nlocked ballot boxes containing absentee ballots\n�d walk-in votes.\nElections Supervisor John Abramson Jr. has\nsaid the district processed ·412 walk-in ballots\nand mailed 331 absentee ballots.\nBut Thomas was optimistic that the board was\ngaining momenttun afIer a troubled start.\n\"Tempers were a little tight yesterday, but\neveryone's happy today,\" Thomas said. \"The\npublic was much quieter and accommodating\njudges to do their jobs.\"\nCandidate Lawrence Olive, who earned 304\npaper-ballot votes on Thursday to bump Lisa\nWilliams from ninth place in the Senate' race.\nsaid he told his supporters to use the paper ballots\nas a more reliable - and legal- alternative\nto the electronic machines.\n\"If the trend continues, I don't see no reason\n\"(hy 1 will not be in the top seven,\" Olive said.\n\"It just goes to show you that the paper ballot is\nthe true count.\"\n- Contact reporter Lou Mattei at 714-9124\nor emaillmalfei@dailynews.vi.\nthat he had not yet been fully briefed\non the fire, but he had a deputy on\nst.

Russell said he was\ntold that Williams had surrendered to law.enforcement\nofficers.\n\"He turned himself in, that's what\" I understand,\"\nRussell said.\nRussell said he had no additional information\nThursday.\nIn October 2011, about 25 federal and local law\nenforcement officers raided the St. Thomas Senate\nbuilding and·Williams' office.\nA federal grand jury handed up an indictment\nThursday charging Williams, Blackett and a third person\nwith operating and participating in crintinal activities\nincluding bribery, wire fraud and mail fraud, U.S.\nAttorney for the District of the Virgin Islands Ronald\nSharpe said in a prepared statement\nThe indictment has not yet been posted by the District\nCourt. However, the statement from Sharpe includes a\nnumber of details from the charging dOCuments inclnding\nthat Williams is accused of:\n• Attempting to bribe Public Works Commissioner\nDanyl Smalls with $10,000 in cash.\n• Accepting bribes from the developers of Raphune\nVIstas.\n• Accepting $35,000 in bribes from the developers of\nthe wind twtines atTutuParkMall.\n• Soliciting kick-hacks from his own staff in exchange\nfor salary raises.\n• Committing wire frand by using public funds to pay\nfor courses and having staff members submit work in\nhis name to obtain an online degree in his name from\n.\nUniversity of Phoenix.\nAccording to Sh3Ipe, if Blackett and Williams are\nconvicted, they face a maximum 20-year prison sentence\nand up to $250,000 in fines.\nPublic Works\nOn Sept. 5, 2009, Williams gave the V.I.

The legislation also would\nhave allowed wholesale renewable energy production\nin B-4 and B-3 zones.\nThe measure was line-item vetoed by deJongh in\nJuly 2009.\nCampaign funds and false reports\nFrom January 2006 to December 20 II, Williams\nand a legislative staff member failed to deposit-certain\ncampaign contributions; withdrew funds from a\ncampaign account; and submitted false campaign disclosure\nreports that failed to include certain contributions,\naccoraing to Sharpe.\nKick-backs from staff\nIn the summer of 20 1 0, Williams tried to solicit\nkick-backs from his own staff in exchange for giving\nthem salary increases, the statement from the U.S.\nattorney's office said.\n.

But the president went beyond that in his victory speech and\nadded some less familiar words to his policy vocabulary.\nChildren should live in a world that is not burdened by debt or weakened by\ninequality, he said, but also one \"that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a\nwarming planet.\" That suggests he knows he has an opportunity to address climate\nchange with more vigor, going beyond auto-mileage standards and renewable-energy\njobs to possibly advocating tougher carbon emissions standards.\nThe president also said he was looking forward to working with Republicans\nto fix the immigration system, giving him a chance to do more than promote\nthe DREAM Act for young immigrants. He could lead the way to comprehensive\nreform that combines strong enforcement with a path to citizenship for\nimmigrants already here. He also hinted that combating poverty might move\nhigher on his priority list.\nAnd he spoke of tax reform, an issue that will immediately begin to grow\nlouder with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts at year's end. Obama won\nre-election on an unambiguous promise not to renew those cuts for incomes of\n$250,000 or more, and his supporters eXpect him to stick to that vow. In coming\nmonths, after he persuades Congress to keep taxes from rising on the middle\nclass, he should push to restore a fair estate tax and raise the low capital\ngains rate to the level of ordinary income.\nHe even mentioned the need to fix a balloting system that left thousands of\npeople standing in long lines to vote this week, a tantalizing hint that electoral\nreform might become a priority.\nAll these agenda items require the same ingredient: ending his standoffish\nattitude toward Congress and working closely with any leader or lawmaker\nwilling to make real progress. That may be easier now that Senate Democrats\n(and their independent allies) have expanded their majority by two seats to 55,\nmany of them filled with newcomers more liberal and feisty than their predecessors,\nmost notably.ElizaMth Warren ofMassachuseUs.\nThe new Democratic caucus' first order of business should be a reform of\nthe filibuster that prevents its routine abuse by Republicans, and the majority\nleader, Harry Reid, suggested Wednesday that he supported some modest\nchanges. The newcomers, along with the White House, should forcefully\nadvocate Iliat he go as far as possible,\nA newly energized Obarna administration and Senate could have the effect of\nisolating the supply-side dead-enders in the House. John Boehner, the House\nspeaker, announced Wednesday that nothing had changed; he and his caucus\nstill oppose higher tax rates for the rich and still want to pursue Romney's\ndefeated goal of raising revenue by lowering rates and cutting unspecified loopholes.\nStanding up to Republican recalcitrance on this and many other issues\nwill require bringing to bear political pressure from the coalition that gave\nObarna a commanding victory in the Electoral College on Thesday.\nThe president's victory was decisive, and many who didn't support him\nnonetheless told pollsters that they agreed with his positions on taxes, health\ncare and immigration. He now needs to use the power that voters have given\nto him to enhance and broaden his agenda.\nSee Your Views In Print\nWe require that you include your full name, island of residence and telephone\nnumber so our staff can contact you.

Then there are\ntimes when we take great leaps forward.\nIf you examine the history of\nour country back to the days of the\nfirst Spanish, English and French\nimmigrants, you will see certain\nmoments when our national dynamic\nshifted.\n1bis week, we saw a moment when\nthe America that has been growing and\nchanging by degrees met with a\nmoment when America made a hard\ntum on its path.\nFor years we have seen the browning\nof America. For years we have seen\nthe tolerance and acceptance level of\ndifferent religions, economic conditions,\nsexual orientations, political\nbeliefs and ancestries grow in measured\nsteps through the increase in on.,.\non-one interactions and social media. -\nFor years we have seen the steady\nprogress of women, and felt a subtle\nshift in the rllythm of America.\nThis week, we saw several of these\ntrends converge in a moment when it\nbecame evident that once again,\nAmerica has changed.\nThe demographics of the exit polls\ntell an interesting story. President\nObama's support came overwhelmingly\nfrom groups of people who are often\ndescribed as disenfumchised:\n• Those who make less than $50,000\nper year;\n• Those with some or no college\neducation;\n-Women;\n• Young people;\n• People of color.\nThese groups, who in the past have\nfelt like their votes were taken for\ngranted, for the first time in a long time,\nsaw their votes carry weight that makes\nthem get noticed.\nPeople more \"wonky\" than me will\n�®2P'??'�\\b5T.�i2m'\nMariel Blake\nbe going over these numbers for\nmonths to come. These numbers tell\nme, though, that the reason why so\nmany people were surprised about the\noutcome in this race ignored the numbers\nthat had nothing to do with polls.\nThey want to say that it is because\nthese communities were voting to keep\ntheir entitlements and \"handouts,\" but\nthat is just a denial of the real truth.\nWhat people want is to no longer\nfeel disenfumchised and marginali:ml\nWhat people want is for their voices\nto be included, not shouted down.\nRecent data shows that women now\noutnumber men by a slim margin.\nMore people live in cities. People of\ncolor now make up alinost a third of\nthe population. The average age is 37.\nAlmost two thirds of us own homes,\nbut there are more of us who have\neither never been married or are\ndivorced than there are those ofus who\n. are martied.\nThe fastest shrinking - demographic\nis white men.\nSo many of the people who fit the\ndemographics that elected President\nObarna are those in demographics that\nare seeing their numbers grow and also\nare becoming more politically active\nand savvy. They are truly looking to\nconnect with candidates who have their\nconcerns in mind. These are not one\nissue voters.\nThey care about the economy but\nthey also care about their place in our\nsociety. They want their social issues to\nbe a part of the discussion. Our national\nidentity is more about inclusion than\nassimilation. This is a vast switch from\nwbere we have been\nThose of us in groups that have been\nconsidered on the fringe ·or in the\nminority have found solidarity in our\nexperiences in this country and are\nincreasingly deciding we are no longer\nsatisfied with trying to fit in and would\nrather have a seat at the table as our\nunique selves.\nWomen, the LGBT community and\nLatinos made great strides with this\nelection. AfricanAmericans and young\npeople reminded the political parties of\nthe value of their support.\nThere is a lot of finger pointing from\nthe Republican .talking heads as to why\ntheir candidate lost. It seems they are\nslowly coming to realize it was not\nonly whom they ran as candidates but\nalso where those candidates stood on\nissues that are important to this growing\nvoting power block.\nI was struck by how few people of\ncolor were in the crowds for Mitt\nRomney toward the end of the campaign.\nIt was like they no longer cared\nabout even the illusion of inclusion,\nand instead decided to hank their future\non their main demographic. What their\ncampaign failed to take into consideration\nis that the issues that matter most\nto people right now stretch across racial\nand gender lines.\nThose of us usually considered on\nthe fringe are multifaceted and have\nlearned a very powerful lesson after\nthis election. When we band together\nto get our issues on the agenda, we\nforce the conversation to change.\nHopefully, both parties have learned\nthat you don't have to pander to us, but\nyou do have to listen to us because we\nare not going away.\nAmerica has changed, and ifhistory\nis any indication that is a very good\nthing.\nLet's just hope we embrace the\nchange in the spirit of cooperation and\nnot segregation.\n- Co ntact Daily News co ntributing\nco lumnist Mariel Blake at\nmarie/fbiake@gmail.com.\n•\n•\n•\nI\nj\nFriday, November 9, 2012\nOPINIONS\nHappy days, even with the cliff\nLa Di Dab Di Dab ...\nWe have been through a lot, people.\n• But now the presidential race is settled\nBarack Obama won. People on both\nsides worked heroically, and, on\nThesday, their candidates behaved well.\nThis should be a happy time.\nOb, my God! There's a fiscal cliffl\nWe're all going to fall over and go\nbankrupt!\nDid you just hear the cheerful rule?\nThe fiscal cliff doesn't happen until the\nend of the year when the Bush tax cuts\nexpire and monster budget cuts automatically\nkick in. Now that the election's\nover, everybody will certainly be\nready to move forward and WOlX something\nout.\nExcept possibly Gov. Rick Perry,\nwho celebrated the president's re-election\nby demanding the repeal of\nObamacare.\nAnd then there was Donald Trump,\nwho tweeted during the vote count:\n\"Lets fight like hell and stop this great\nand disgusting injustice! The world is\nlaughing at us.\"\nActually Trump has no conceivable\nimpact on anything. I just wanted to\ntake this opportunity to reminisce about\nthe time he sent me an irate, handwritten\nmessage in which he misspelled the\nword \"too.\"\nBut look at Rep. John Boehner. On\n• Wednesday, the House speaker gave a\nspeech in which he vowed to be cooperative.\n\"Mister President, this is your\nmoment. We're ready. to be led,\" he\nsaid.\nExcept for a few no-go areas, such\nas any tax increases on \"small business.\"\nYou may remember from previous\nerises that the House Republicans\noppose raising income taxes on the\nwealthy because it would impact struggling\nsmall businesses such as a hedge\n•\n,\nGail Collins\nfimd manager with an eight-figure\nannual income.\nBoehner also raised a whole new\nspecter of political peril: \"going over\npart of the fiscal cliff.\" That sounded\nless dire, as long as we all slay inside\nour dangling cars and refrain from\nmaking any moves until help arrives.\nBut, by the end, it sounded as if the\nonly cliff-avoidance Boehner was really\ninterested in was one that raised new\nrevenue through \"fewer loopholes, and\nlower rates for all.\"\nWe have already seen that plan. It\nwas proposed by a man who, on\nTuesday, lost the state in which he was\nborn, the slate in which he was governor\nand the three slates in which he\nowns houses. Thanks to a blog by Eric\nOstermeier in Smart Politics, I am able\nto point out that the only candidate for\npresident who lost his home state by a\nlarger margin than Mitt Romney was\nJohn Fremont in 1856. And Fremont\nwas coming out of a campaign in\nwhich the opposition accused him of\nbeing a cannibal.\nWhile Boehner was explaining the\nimportance of not going halfway over\na cliff, or raising income taxes on the\nricb, he looked somber and somewhat\nunhappy. This may have been because\nhis Republican colleagues just lost the\nWhite House and the Senate. Or perhaps,\nit was simply because he's an\n. older white guy, and, therefore, part of\nthe biggest loser demographic of the\nelection, the flip-side of the insurgent\nLatino vote.\nOn election nigh� people were talking\nabout the not-young male population\nas if they were a dwiodling tribe of\ngraybeards sitting around a sputtering\nstove in Oklaboma Republican _\ngist John Weaver worried about\nbeconting \"a shrinking regional party\nof ntiddle-aged and older white men.\"\nOn Fox News, Bill O'Reilly moaned\nthat \"the white establishment is now\nthe minority.\"\nO'Reilly, 63, added that the new\nmajority was composed of people\nwho \"want stuff.\" As opposed to\nolder white men, all of whom have\nsigned a pledge Dever to accept veteran\nbenefits, Social Security or\nMedicare.\n\"It's not a traditional America anymore,\"\nO'Reilly sadly concluded\nAlmost everybody thinks of the\nworld of their youth as the traditional\nworld. In the future, today's teenagers\nwill he looking back and mournfully\ndeclaring that traditional America was\na place where folks really knew how to\nTwitter. Still, it's unseemly to identify\nthe true America as the one where your\ngroup ran everything.\nCheer up, white men! You seem to\nbe doing OK. Next year women will\nhave 20 percent of the seats in the U.s.\nSenate, and we're celebrating.\nAnd since it looks as if we're not\ngetting any downtime, we'll have to\nget cracking on this latest congressional\ncrisis. Root for a bipartisan solution\nthat does not involve the White House's\nbeing hijacked by a guy who keeps\nbabbling about going halfway over a\ncliff\nIn the past, when these things came\nup, the president's big failing was his\ninability to hide his contempt for many\nof the people who occupy Capitol Hill.\nNow it's a new day, and he needs to be\nso perpetually and visibly avaiJahle that\nthe negotiator.; beg to be left alone.\nIf all else fails, strap John Boehner\nto the roof of a car.·\n- Gail Co llins is a New\n.\nYo rk\nTImes columnist.\n�����\n2012\nThe Virgin Is!ands Daily News.25\nCan Republi·cans adapt?\nThis was one that the Republicans\nreally should have won.\nGiven the weak economy,American\nvoters were open to firing President\nBarack Obama. In Europe, in similar\ncircumstances, onc government after\nanother lost re-election. And, at the\nbegimting of this year, it looked as if\nthe Republicans ntight win control of\nthe U.S. Senate as well.\nYet it wasn't the Democrats who\nwon so much as the Republicans who\nlost - at a most basic level, because\nof demography. A coalition of aging\nwhite men is a recipe for failure in a\nnation that increasingly looks like a\nrainbow.\nSchadenfreude may excuse\nDemocrats' smiles for a few days, but\nthese trends portend a potential disas\nter not just for the Republican Party\nbut for the health of our political system.\nAmerica needs a plausible center-right\nopposition party to hold\nObama's feet to the ftre, not just a\ncollection of Tea Party cranks.\nSo liberals as well as conservatives\nshould be rooting for the Republican\nParty to feel sufficiendy shaken that it\nshifts to the center. One hopeful sign is\nthat political parties usually care more\nabout winning than about purism.\nThus the Democratic Party embraced\nthe pragmatic center-left Bill Clinton\nin 1992 after three consecutive . losses\nin presidential elections.\nThat was painful for many liberals,\nwho cringed when Clinton interrupted\ncampaigning in the 1992 primary\nto·burnish his law-and-order credentials\nby overseeing the execution of a\nmentally impaired murderer. But it\nwas, on balance, less painful than los\ning again.\nYou would expect the Republican\nParty to make a similar lurch to the\ncenter. But many Republican leaders\nstill inhabit a bubble. It was stunning\nhow many, from Karl Rove to Newt\nGingrich, seemed to expect a Mitt\nRomney victory. And some of the\nright-wing postmortems are suggesting\nthat Romney lost because he was\ntoo libetal-which constitutes a defirtition\nof delusional.\nImagine what would have happened\nif the Republican nominee had\nbeen Gingrich or Rick Santorum. We\nsurely would have seen a Democratic\nlandslide.\nOn the other hand, if the\nRepublicans had nominated Jon\nHuntsman Jr., they ntight have been\nthe ones celebrating right now. But he\nhad no chance in Republican prima:\nries because primary voters are their\nparty's worst enemy.\nPart of the problem, I think, is the\nprofusion of right-wing radio and\ntelevision programs. Democrats complain\nfuriously that Rush Limbaugh,\nGlenn Beck and Sean Hannity smear\nthe left, but I wonder if the bigger\nloser isn't the Republican Party itself\nThose shows whip up a frenzy in\ntheir audience, torpedoing Republican\nmoderates and instilling paranoia on\nNicholas D.
