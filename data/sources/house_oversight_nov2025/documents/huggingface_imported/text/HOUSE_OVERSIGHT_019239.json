These 21° century authori-\ntarians developed an arsenal of new tactics to use\nagainst their domestic opponents, and gone on the\noffensive in an effort to subvert and replace the liberal\ninternational order.\n\nBut modern authoritarian systems are not simply\nadversaries of free societies. They also represent an\nalternative model—a grim future for beleaguered\ndemocracies that have already fallen under the sway\nof illiberal leaders and have suffered an erosion of\nfreedom.\n\nDemocracy under siege\n\nGlobal democracy is currently facing the repercus-\nsions of what has been called the “decade of decline.\"\nThe phrase describes a 10-year-plus period, from 2006\nto 2016, during which the state of freedom experi-\nenced more reversals than gains as measured by Free-\ndom in the World, the annual report on political rights\nand civil liberties published by Freedom House.\n\nAccording to Freedom in the World, the crucial\nindicators of democracy experienced setbacks in\neach of the 10 years in question. In all, 105 countries\nsuffered net declines, while 61 showed some mea-\nsure of improvement. The decade marked the longest\ndemocratic slump of its kind in more than 40 years of\nFreedom House analysis.’\n\nThe decade of decline has been principally character-\nized by a steady erosion of political institutions in es-\ntablished authoritarian countries, or in countries that\nwere clearly headed in that direction. In other words,\nrepressive countries became even more repressive—\nthe bad became even worse.’\n\nHowever, a parallel pattern of institutional erosion has\naffected some more democratic states, pushing them\ninto the category of “illiberal democracies.” In these so-\ncieties, elections are regularly conducted, sometimes\nunder conditions that are reasonably fair. But the state,\nusually under the control of a strong party or leader,\napplies much of its energy to the systematic weaken-\ning of political pluralism and the creation of a skewed\nelectoral playing field. Opposition parties are often\nimpotent, freedom of the press is circumscribed, and\nthe judiciary tends to be dominated by the ruling party.\nCountries that fit this description include Hungary,\nBolivia, Ecuador, and, if recent trends continue, Poland.\n\nThere are many reasons for the global decline in dem-\nocratic indicators, but the statistical evidence from\nFreedom in the World suggests that modern author-\nitarian regimes have found a way to survive without\nresorting to democratic reforms, and that a number\nof democracies—as part of the general loss of liberal\nconsensus—are engaging in their own antidemocratic\nexperiments.\n\nModern authoritarianism\n\nThe traditional authoritarian state sought monopolis-\ntic control over political life, a one-party system orga-\n\nnized around a strongman or military junta, and direct\nrule by the executive, sometimes through martial law,\nwith little or no role for the parliament.\n\nTraditional dictatorships and totalitarian regimes were\noften defined by closed, command, or autarkic econo-\nmies, a state media monopoly with formal censorship,\nand “civil society” organizations that were structured\n\nas appendages of the ruling party or state. Especially\n\nin military dictatorships, the use of force—including\nmilitary tribunals, curfews, arbitrary arrests, political\ndetentions, and summary executions—was pervasive.\nOften facing international isolation, traditional dictator-\nships and totalitarian regimes forged alliances based on\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019239",
