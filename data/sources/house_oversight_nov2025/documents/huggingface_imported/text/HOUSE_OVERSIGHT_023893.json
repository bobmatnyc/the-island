  "text": "Defining Intelligence 147\n\nCouric: Can you think of any?\n\nPalin: Well, I could think of .. . any again, that could be best\ndealt with on a more local level. Maybe I would take issue\nwith. But, you know, as mayor, and then as governor\nand even as a vice president, if I’m so privileged to serve,\nwouldn't be in a position of changing those things but in\nsupporting the law of the land as it reads today.\n\nSo little of what Palin says makes sense that this interview was seen as a\nnational embarrassment, provoking multiple explanations for it from\nthe Palin camp, none of which said: She is just stupid and ignorant.\n\nObviously that is what her detractors were thinking. But is it true?\nIs she stupid and ignorant? How can we find out? Look at this next\npiece of the Couric interview:\n\nCouric: .. . people have questioned your readiness since that\ninterview. And I’m curious to hear your reaction.\n\nPalin: Well, not only am I ready but willing and able to serve as\nvice president with Senator McCain if Americans so bless us\nand privilege us with the opportunity of serving them, ready\nwith my executive experience as a city mayor and manager,\nas a governor, as a commissioner, a regulator of oil and gas,\nnot only with my résumé proving that readiness, but I think\nthe important thing here is that John McCain and I, we share\na vision for America that includes energy independence.\n\nWhat could be clearer than the idea that she is simply out of her\nleague and that it was a foolish idea to promote her as a possible vice\npresident? Why cynical politicians decide this is OK to do is not my\nproblem. The question I want to address is what makes one intelli-\ngent, apart from genetics.\n\nLooking at what we have seen here, we can think about our 12\ncognitive processes one more time. Which of them are critical to the\neveryday assessment of the intelligence of another person that most\npeople do on a daily basis?\n\nLet’s start by eliminating some. Being able to evaluate something,\nor having a set of values you believe in, has very little to do with basic\nintelligence. The samples of stupidity that I cite above do not indicate\nthat any of this ability—determining what is important—is missing in\nthe people being interviewed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023893",
