Like most, I model\ninheritance as zero and physical capital acquisition as beginning after age of\nindependence A. That can be modeled as age 20. As human depreciation begins then\nat zero, if depreciation theory is right, gross realized work (pay) simplifies at first to\nrealized work. This takes up all the new worker's time and attention, yet\n\nsimultaneously enables subliminal self-invested work in job experience.\n\nIt seems reasonable to model pay at job entry as equal to the new worker's\nmaintenance consumption, on the reasoning that independence means reaching the\nability to earn it. Thus nothing is left for investment in physical capital at first. But\nthe quick buildup of job experience soon means pay left for investment. As I model\n\nno pay plowback, that means physical capital acquisition.\n\nHuman depreciation rises slowly while the self-invested work of job experience\ndiminishes, so that overall growth in human capital peaks and then declines.\nPhysical capital owned does the same as we acquire it and then spend it on the\nyoung. Young arrive, on average, as a cohort reaches age 28.5 (my estimate of the\ngeneration length). The cohort of adults begins divesting its capital of both factors in\n\nnurture and schooling received by the young as invested consumption.\n\nThe young reach independence on average when the adult cohort reaches age 57 (2\nx 28.5). Some young will have been born after parental age 28.5, and will continue to\nreceive parental investment over the eight years remaining between age 57 and\nretirement modeled at age 65. But my model cannot account confidently for this\neight year gap on the whole, or for the retirement period following, which runs\ntwice as long. My hypothesis is that retirees are effectively employees hired by\nproductives to help take care of the kids, while the eight-year gap might show a\nhuman capital reserve against nasty surprises.\n\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 24\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011150",
