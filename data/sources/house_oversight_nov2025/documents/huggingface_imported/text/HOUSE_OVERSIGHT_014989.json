  "text": "Notable trends and dislocations (Asia)\n\nMost regions in Asia reported modest declines last week, led by Hong Kong’s HSCEI,\nwhich lost 2.0% week-over-week. Much of the decline came on Thursday following the\nUS Fed’s decision to hike rates 25bps. Also in China, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)\ninjected 410bn yuan (about $60bn) into the financial system via reverse-repos, the\nlargest cash boost since January. The central bank said the funds are meant to ease\nconcern amid a seasonal funding squeeze. The biggest contributors to the index’s loss\nwere financials names, including China Life Insurance (2628 HK), which fell 5.7%, Ping\nAn Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (2318 HK}, which dropped 3.7%, Bank of China Ltd\n(3988 Hk), which declined 1.8%, and China Merchants Bank Co Ltd (3968 Hk), which fell\n5.7%. We saw a similar decline from Hong Kong’s HSI index, which lost 1.6% percent\nlast week.\n\nAfter the HSCEI and HSI, last week’s biggest losers were Korea’s KOSPI and India’s\nNIFTY, which each returned -0.8% week-over-week. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 0.3%. On\nFriday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) left its monetary policy unchanged—it will continue to\ncontrol the yield curve via its negative benchmark rate and its asset purchasing program.\nThe final region to report a loss last week was Taiwan’s TWSE, which lost 0.4%.\n\nOn the other hand, the only region to see a gain last week was Australia, which saw its\nASX 200 benchmark increase 1.7% week-over-week. The biggest contributors to the\ngain were Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA AU}, which gained 3.4%, Westpac\nBanking Corp (WBC AU), which increased 1.9%, and CSL Ltd (CSL AU), which added\n2.9%.\n\n10 day realized vol picked up in Asia last week, up 2.0 vol points to 9.6%\n\n« Asian 3m ATM volatility declined on average 0.1 vol point to 12.3% last week, while\n10 day realized vol increased on average 2.0 vol points to 9.6%. Notably, the HSI's\nrealized vol increased 5.4 vol points, the biggest increase in the region. On the\nother hand, the NKY was the only index to see a decline in 10 day realized vol—it\ndropped 4.3 vol points week-over-week to 7.2%.\n\n¢ On average, term structures among Asian indices steepened by 0.2 vol points to\n4.2% last week. The TWSE 12M-1M term structure steepened the most, increasing\n1.0 vol point to 2.9%. On the other hand, Hong Kong’s HS! saw the only flattening\nas its term structure flattened 0.1 vol point to 4.9%.\n\ne Asian 3M 90-110% skews widened 0.5 vol points on average to 3.8%.
