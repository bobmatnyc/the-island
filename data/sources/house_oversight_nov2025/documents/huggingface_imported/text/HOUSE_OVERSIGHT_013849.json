  "text": "Stop asking for opinions and start proposing solutions. Begin with the small things. If someone is going\nto ask, or asks, “Where should we eat?” “What movie should we watch?” “What should we do tonight?”\nor anything similar, do NOT reflect it back with, “Well, what do you want to ... ?” Offer a solution. Stop\nthe back-and-forth and make a decision. Practice this in both personal and professional environments.\nHere are a few lines that help (my favorites are the first and last):\n\n“Can I make a suggestion?”\n\n“IT propose ...”\n\n“Td like to propose ...”\n\n“I suggest that ... What do you think?”\n\n“Let’s try ... and then try something else if that doesn’t work.”\n\n» LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\n\nI’m a musician who got your book because Derek Sivers at CD Baby recommended it. Checking\nPareto’s Law I realized that 78% of my downloads came from just one of my CDs and that 55% of my\ntotal download income came from only five songs! It showed me what my fans are looking for and\nallowed me to showcase those on my web site. Downloads are the way to go. iTunes sells the song and\nCD Baby direct deposits it to my account. Fully automated once the recording is done. There are some\nmonths I can live off download income. Once I finish paying off debt, it should be no problem to travel\nas an artist and create new fans all over the world and have a cyber income stream.\n\n—VICTOR JOHNSON\n\nAs for “outsourcing” your banking, any company that needs to take checks (cheques) should consider\na lock box solution. Just about any bank that does business banking offers it. All checks go to a PO box\nat the bank, the bank processes the checks and deposits them, and according to your instructions can\nsend you a file of all the checks that are deposited. Normally this can be done in either a flat, Excel or\nother file type that can interface with any accounting systems from Excel, to Quicken to SAP. Quite cost\neffective.\n\n—ANONYMOUS\n\n6\n\nThe Low-Information Diet\n\n=» CULTIVATING SELECTIVE IGNORANCE\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013849",
