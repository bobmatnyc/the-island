  "text": "I disagree with most of their attitude. We don't need innocence. We don't need sexual\nmystery. We don't need to eliminate teen sex. We don't need to re-establish some\nlimiting, patriarchal \"manly ideal.\" But they've got one thing right: we do need to start\ntalking about sex as something that is not mostly mechanical -- as something that, yes,\ncan be \"a private sphere for the creation of human meaning.”\n\n3. [wish I'd learned this: \"Good sex doesn't just require two (or more) people who like\nsex. It requires desire -- and desire simply doesn't work the same way for everyone.\"\n\nI've said before that I went through a period -- back when I was first becoming sexually\nactive -- where I simply could not figure out why sexual acts with people I didn't care\nabout didn't seem to turn me on. Or rather -- they turned me on a little, but not... much. It\ntook me a while to understand that sex requires more than just two eager people. It\nrequires attraction and desire.\n\nWhen I was fifteen or so, and at summer camp, I remember making out with a boy. I\ndidn't really want to make out with him, but I wasn't sure how to reject him (more on this\nunder point 5). And I figured: he seems nice enough, so I might as well make out with\nhim. Afterwards, I felt angry at myself, and I felt like I'd wasted my time -- and I felt\nconfused. I'd been bored at best and repulsed at worst, and I wasn't sure why I felt that\nway, or why I'd done something that made me feel that way.\n\nSo why had I done it? Because I'd thought: \"Sex is value-neutral.\" Because I'd thought:\n\"Making out is fun, right? -- that means I ought to do it when I get the chance!\" Because\nI'd thought: \"My preference not to make out with him is probably just some silly\nrepression that I need to get over.\" Because I didn't understand that desire is complicated,\nthat you can't just make yourself feel desire when it's convenient, and that you don't need\na reason for your attractions -- or lack of attraction. This situation was to reprise itself in\nvarious forms over the next years, until I finally learned that sometimes you simply want\nor don't want things, and that you aren't required to justify your desires.\n\n4. I wish I'd gotten a list of suggestions: \"Here are some places you might go to start\nfiguring out what turns you on.\"\n\nI was told that sex was fun. I was even told to explore! But I still spent years with very\nlittle actual idea of what I wanted. No one ever told me how or where I might be able to\nlearn more about my needs, or what exploring my needs might look like. And no one ever\nexplained that people are turned on by different things, that some people like some sex\nacts and don't like others, and that's okay.\n\nI went into sex with a buffet-style attitude, thinking that I must naturally enjoy sex\nequally in all ways. I was so surprised when I found out that I like some positions better\nthan others! I remember how confused I was when I dated a guy who didn't like fellatio,\nand how hurt I felt -- like his lack of enjoyment meant that I must be doing it wrong,\nbecause everyone likes oral sex, right?\n\nAnd of course, while I had a pretty comprehensive idea of the vanilla sex acts I could\nexperiment with, I had very little idea of what else was out there. In retrospect I find this\nhilarious, but I remember -- back in my vanilla days -- I had two boyfriends who tied me\nup. They tied me up and were nice to me, and I suppose it was amusing enough, but\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018463",
