  "text": "IRA, so as to provide, say, children and grandchildren with long-term income-tax free annuities.\nNevertheless, even if those beneficiaries had to take the balance of the Roth IRA within five years of the\nowner's death, they still would be receiving income-tax free dollars — something that would not be the\ncase if they had simply “inherited” a traditional IRA with its built-in income tax liability. In other words, by\nconverting a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, the owner is accomplishing something akin to what happens\nwith a defective grantor trust (see above): relieving the beneficiaries of an income tax liability they would\notherwise have to pay.\n\nLimit the size of retirement benefits. Under current law, there are limits as to how much individuals\ncan accrue under a defined benefit plan (such as a pension plan), or how much they can contribute to\nIRAs and various defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. There are no limits, however, as to how\nmuch individuals can accumulate in these tax-preferred accounts. Because of this, the proposal\nexplains, individuals can accumulate more than is needed to fund “reasonable levels of consumption in\nretirement...well beyond the level of accumulation that justifies tax-advantaged treatment of retirement\nsavings accounts.” The proposal would therefore cap the size of a taxpayer’s various retirement\naccounts by barring additional contributions (or accruals) if, in total, the accounts exceeded what was\nnecessary to provide the maximum annuity permitted for a defined benefit plan: currently $205,000 per\nyear for a hypothetical 62 year-old and her spouse (this equates to accumulations of about $3.4 million).\nWhen a taxpayer’s accounts hit that ceiling, they could still grow through investment returns, but\nadditions to the accounts would only be allowed if the maximum permitted annuity increased, or the\ntaxpayer's investment returns for a given year were less than the actuarial assumptions underlying the\nannuity. If an addition put a taxpayer’s accounts over the ceiling, the taxpayer would include that excess\nin income, and have a grace period to withdraw it; if the taxpayer did not withdraw the excess, then that\namount and attributable earnings would be subject to income tax when distributed, even if the\ndistribution was from a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k).\n\nComments. This new proposal seems to be a reaction to this fall's presidential elections and the\nsignificant retirement accounts of one of the contenders. Nevertheless, it is not an excise tax to whittle\ndown significant accounts, but a prohibition on additional contributions (or accruals). As Treasury\nSecretary Lew has pointed out, we’re not saying you can’t save for retirement, we're just saying that\nsuch large amounts shouldn't be tax-preferred. Still, will Congress really be inclined to limit how much\ntaxpayers can accumulate in their retirement accounts, especially when a rising interest rate\nenvironment would make the permitted accumulation smaller? Although anything is possible,\nparticularly if tax reform really comes about, Congressional sentiment might be against what could be\nviewed as “penalizing” successful savers.\n\nReplace Consumer Price Index (CPI) with Chained CPI. Every year, the IRS issues inflation-adjusted\nnumbers for a variety of provisions, such as the income thresholds for the individual income tax rate\nbrackets, personal exemptions, and income thresholds and phase-out ranges for various deductions,\nexclusions and tax credits. The proposal states that the CPI overstates the effects of inflation because it\ndoesn't fully reflect consumer reaction to price changes (as in, if prices go up, consumers will buy\nsomething cheaper). A “chained” CPI would “account more fully for this substitution effect” and better\nreflect changes in the cost of living. The proposal would take effect as of 2015.\n\nComments. Just as the proposal to limit tax benefits for income that would be taxed at higher than 28%\nwould raise taxes on some of those President Obama has previously pledged to protect (see above), a\nchained CPI would also raise taxes for everyone, in that tax brackets (and other tax benefits, such as\npersonal exemptions) would increase more slowly. Similarly, a chained CPI would reduce cost-of-living\nincreases for Social Security recipients — again something that would affect those the President has\npledged to protect. Although this proposal represents an attempt at balance, Republicans and\nDemocrats generally seem to dislike it, but for different reasons.\n\nTax Topics 04/29/13 5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022365",
