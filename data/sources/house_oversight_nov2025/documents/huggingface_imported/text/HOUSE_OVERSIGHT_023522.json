  "text": "6\n\nillustrated the potentially decisive power of one state — Ohio and\nNevada.\n\nA test of Mr. Obama’s support will come June 20, when he will hold\na fund-raiser for about 80 Jewish donors at a private dinner.\n\nJohn R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United\nNations and a possible Republican presidential candidate, argues that\nbecause of administration proposals, Republicans will be able to\nmake gains not only among American Jews but also among\nevangelicals who are supportive of Israel on biblical grounds, and\nother voters.\n\nMr. Bolton said that he was on a cruise sponsored by the conservative\nmagazine Weekly Standard last week in the Mediterranean, and that\nmost of the people on the ship “reacted very strongly against” Mr.\nObama’s speech outlining his Mideast vision. “As a Republican,” he\nsaid, “you can use this to show how radical the president’s policies\nare on a whole range of issues.”\n\nThe depth of Democrats’ worries was evident from the competition to\nout-applaud Republicans on Tuesday during Mr. Netanyahu’s speech\nto a joint meeting of Congress and from the speed with which\nCongressional Democrats led by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the\nmajority leader, distanced themselves from Mr. Obama on Israel.\n‘Are there questions in the American-Jewish community? I think the\nanswer is yes,” said Mr. Mellman, who is Jewish and has polled the\ncommunity for Democrats in the past. “Has Obama been branded as\nnot pro-Israel or anti-Israel? Not at all.”\n\n“T think he is strongly pro-Israel, in fact,” he added. “But that is the\npolitical struggle in which the Republicans are engaged, which is to\nget him branded as not pro-Israel. And to the extent they’re\nsuccessful in that, the likelihood is they would have some meaningful\nimpact on the Jewish vote.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023522",
