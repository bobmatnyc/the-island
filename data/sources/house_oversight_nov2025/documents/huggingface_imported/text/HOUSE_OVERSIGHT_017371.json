  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\ntrue, Woody’s actions would demonstrate extreme insensitivity to Mia Farrow’s family. Here is\nhow the appellate court ultimately characterized Woody’s behavior.\n\n“In January of 1992, Mr. Allen took the photographs of Ms. Previn [Soon Yi] which were\ndiscovered on the mantelpiece in his apartment by Ms. Farrow and were introduced into\nevidence...Mr. Allen in his trial testimony stated that he took the photos at Ms. Previn's\nsuggestion and that he considered them erotic and not pornographic. We have viewed the\nphotographs and do not share Mr. Allen's characterization of them. We find the fact that\nMr. Allen took them at a time when he was formally assuming a legal responsibility for\ntwo of Ms. Previn's siblings to be totally unacceptable. The distinction Mr. Allen makes\nbetween Ms. Farrow's other children and Dylan, Satchel and Moses is lost on this Court.\nThe children themselves do not draw the same distinction that Mr. Allen does. This is\nsadly demonstrated by the profound effect his relationship with Ms. Previn has had on the\nentire family. Allen's testimony that the photographs of Ms. Previn “... were taken, as I\nsaid before, between two consenting adults wanting to do this ...” demonstrates a chosen\nignorance of his and Ms. Previn's relationships to Ms. Farrow, his three children and Ms.\nPrevin's other siblings. His continuation of the relationship, viewed in the best possible\nlight, shows a distinct absence of judgment. It demonstrates to this Court Mr. Allen's\ntendency to place inappropriate emphasis on his own wants and needs and to minimize and\neven ignore those of his children. At the very minimum, it demonstrates an absence of any\nparenting skills.”\n\nMia asked me to call Woody and tell him to stop doing what he was doing. She told me that\nWoody admired me and that he kept a copy of my book Chutzpah on his bed table.\n\nI asked Mia to have Woody call me but he apparently refused so I decided to write him a letter,\nwhich I asked his lawyer to give him. In the letter, I urged Woody to try to resolve the matter\nprivately:\n\n“T still believe that matter can be resolved without even more escalation and damage to all\nparties. As you and Mia both know, I am a great admirer of your work, and I do not want\nto see your career and your life destroyed. Right now you are on that road and something\nmust be done to head it off, not only for your sake, but for the sake of the children and for\nMia.”\n\nI don’t know whether he ever got the letter. I received no reply. Mia then asked me to contact\nhis lawyers and see if the matter could be resolved without any public disclosure. I said I would\ntry. I called his lawyers and they agreed to a meeting in New York. I brought with me to the\nmeeting a law school classmate, David Levett, who was a leading lawyer in Connecticut and was\nknowledgeable about the Connecticut law relating to such issues. Our goal, and Mia’s, was to\nbring about some resolution of this troubling matter without any publicity, which she felt would\nbe harmful to her children.\n\n284\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017371",
