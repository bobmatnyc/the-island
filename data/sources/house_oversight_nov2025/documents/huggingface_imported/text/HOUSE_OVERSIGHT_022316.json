The Board\nresponds that any costs that employers\nmay incur in responding to employee\nquestions, in setting forth the\nemployers’ views on unions and\ncollective bargaining, or in opposing\nunion organizing efforts will be incurred\nentirely at the employers’ own volition;\nthey are not a cost of complying with\nthe rule.\n\nAs discussed above, many comments\nexpress concerns that union supporters\nwill tear down the notices in order to\nexpose employers to 8(a)(1) liability for\nfailing to post the notices. Some of these\ncomments also contend that, as a result,\nemployers will have to spend\nconsiderable time monitoring the\nnotices to make sure that they are not\ntorn down, or incur additional costs of\ninstalling tamper-proof bulletin boards.\nOne commenter predicts that his\nemployer will have to spend $20,000 for\nsuch bulletin boards at a single facility,\nor a total of $100,000 at all of its\nfacilities, and even then will have to\nspend two hours each month\nmonitoring the postings. For the reasons\ndiscussed above, the Board is not\nconvinced at this time that the problem\nof posters being torn down is anything\nmore than speculative, and accordingly\nis inclined to discount these predictions\nsubstantially. In any event, the rule\nrequires only that employers ‘‘take\nreasonable steps’’—not every\nconceivable step—to ensure that the\n\n205 See, e.g., comments of Cass County Electric\nCooperative and Baker & McKenzie. The latter\nestimates that each private sector employee will\nspend at least an hour attending meetings\nconcerning the content of the notice, and that the\ncost to the economy in terms of lost employee work\ntime will be $3.5 billion.\n\n206 See, e.g., comment of Dr. Pepper Snapple\nGroup.\n\n207 See, e.g., comments of Metro Toyota and\nCapital Associated Industries, Inc.\n\nnotice is not defaced or torn down. The\nrule does not require, or even suggest,\nthat employers must spend thousands of\ndollars to install tamper-proof bulletin\nboards or that employers must\nconstantly monitor the notice.2°8\n\nOne comment contends that most\nsmall employers do not have 11 x 17-\ninch color printers, and therefore will\nhave to have the posters printed\ncommercially at a cost that, alone,\nassertedly will exceed the Board’s\nestimate of the cost of the rule. The\nBoard understands the concerns of this\nsmall employer. The Board points out\nthat it will furnish a reasonable number\nof copies of the notice free of charge to\nany requesting employer. Moreover, as\nexplained above, employers may\nreproduce the notice in black-and-white\nand may print the notice on two\nstandard-sized, 8.5 x 11-inch pages and\ntape or bind them together, rather than\nhaving them printed commercially.\n\nA number of comments argue that the\nrule will lead to workplace conflict. For\nexample, the comment of Wiseda\nCorporation contains the following:\n\nUnnecessary Confusion and Conflict in the\nWorkplace. The labor law terms and\nindustrial union language of the proposed\nnotice (such as hiring hall and concerted\nactivity) present an unclear and adversarial\npicture to employees. Most non-union\nemployers like us, who wish to remain non-\nunion, encourage cooperative problem\nsolving. In a modern non-union workplace,\nto require such a poster encouraging strikes\nand restroom leaflets is disrespectful of the\nhard work and good intentions of employers,\nmanagement, and employees. The proposed\nposter would exist alongside other company\nnotices on problem-solving, respect for\nothers, resolving harassment issues, etc., and\nwould clearly be out of character and\ninappropriate. (Emphasis in original.)\nAnother comment puts it more bluntly:\n“The notice as proposed is more of an\ninvitation to cause employee/employer\ndisputes rather than an explanation of\nemployee rights.” The Board’s response\nis that the ill effects predicted in these\ncomments, like the predicted adverse\neffects of unionization discussed above,\nare not costs of compliance with the\ntule, but of employees’ learning about\ntheir workplace rights. In addition,\nCongress, not the Board, created the\nsubject rights and did so after finding\nthat vesting employees with these rights\nwould reduce industrial strife.\n\nB, Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 29\n\nThe final rule imposes certain\nminimal burdens associated with the\n\n208 Contrary to one comment’s suggestion, no\nemployer will be “bankrupted” by fines imposed if\nthe notice is torn down. As explained above, the\nBoard does not have the authority to impose fines.\n\n209 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.\n\nposting of the employee notice required\nby § 104.202. As noted in § 104.202(e),\nthe Board will make the notice\navailable, and employers will be\npermitted to post copies of the notice\nthat are exact duplicates in content,\nsize, format, and type size and style.\nUnder the regulations implementing the\nPRA, “[t]he public disclosure of\ninformation originally supplied by the\nFederal government to [a] recipient for\nthe purpose of disclosure to the public”\nis not considered a ‘‘collection of\ninformation” under the Act. See 5 CFR\n1320.3(c)(2). Therefore, contrary to\nseveral comments, the posting\nrequirement is not subject to the\nPRA.21°\n\nThe Board received no comments\nsuggesting that the PRA covers the costs\nto the Federal government of\nadministering the regulations\nestablished by the proposed rule.\nTherefore, the NPRM’s discussion of\nthis issue stands.\n\nAccordingly, this rule does not\ncontain information collection\nrequirements that require approval by\nthe Office of Management and Budget\nunder the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.).\n\nC. Congressional Review Act (CRA}?\"!\n\nThis rule is a “‘major rule” as defined\nby Section 804(2) of the Small Business\nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of\n1996 (Congressional Review Act),\nbecause it will have an effect on the\neconomy of more than $100 million, at\nleast during the year it takes effect. 5\nU.S.C. 804(2)(A).212 Accordingly, the\n\n210 The California Chamber of Commerce and the\nNational Council of Agricultural Employers dispute\nthis conclusion. They assert that the PRA\ndistinguishes between the “agencies” to which it\napplies and the “Federal government,” and\ntherefore that the exemption provided in 5 CFR\n1320.3(c)(2) applies only to information supplied by\n“the actual Federal government,” not to information\nsupplied by a Federal agency such as the Board.\nThe flaw in this argument is that there is no such\nlegal entity as “the [actual] Federal government.”\nWhat is commonly referred to as ‘‘the Federal\ngovernment” is a collection of the three branches\nof the United States government, including the\ndepartments of the executive branch, and the\nvarious independent agencies, including the Board.\nIf ‘the Federal government” can be said to act at\nall, it can do so only through one or more of those\nentities—in this instance, the Board—and that is\nundoubtedly the meaning that the drafters of 5 CFR\n1320(c})(2) meant to convey.\n\n2115 U.S.C. 801 et seq.\n\n212 A rule is a “major rule” for CRA purposes if\nit will (A) Have an annual effect on the economy\nof $100 million or more; (B) cause a major increase\nin costs or prices for consumers, individual\nindustries, government agencies, or geographic\nregions; or (C) result in significant adverse effects\non competition, employment, investment,\nproductivity, innovation, or the ability of United\nStates-based enterprises to compete with foreign-\nbased enterprises in domestic and export markets.\n5 U.S.C. 804.
