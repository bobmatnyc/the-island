Computers are not going to wake up one\nmorning and decide to compose a breathtakingly beautiful symphony,\nbut if we give them rules they can make a convincing version.\n\nMany computer systems have been designed to tackle creativity. We\nhave already met the composer Emily Howell and Douglass Hofstadter’s\ncomputation program. Here are two more examples: Jape and AARON,\nwhich create jokes and art, respectively.\n\nJape — Joke Analysis and Production Engine — is a program created\nby Graeme Ritchie and Kim Binsted. It generates puns, the sort of things\nyou might find in an English Christmas cracker or children’s joke book.\nPil let the output speak for itself.\n\nQ: “What is the difference between leaves and a car?”\nA: “One you brush and rake, the other you rush and brake.”\n\nQ: “What do you call a spicy missile?”\nA: “A hot shot!”\n\nOne of the most enlightening examples of computer creativity is\nAARON - refreshingly not an acronym. His machine is depicted here\nand you should look up some works on the web, such as Adam and Eve,\nand Aaron’s Garden. The program encodes rules about figures, objects\n\nAARON - Harold Cohen, Automatic Painting Machine\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016000",
