As in other countries, it is difficult to distinguish between the\nvoluntary exposure to influence by French seeking to benefit from China’s rise and\nactive efforts by Beijing to exploit French vulnerabilities.\n\nBoth the Left and Right in France have supported close ties with China. The dual\nnature of these ties differs from other European countries where for the most part\nthe Left has been critical of US policy in Asia and supportive of China and Vietnam.\nIn France’s case, it was the Right, under Charles de Gaulle, which recognized China\nin January 1964 and criticized US policy during the Vietnam War. So, for example, in\nJanuary 2014, an all-night celebration for the fiftieth anniversary of the recognition\nwas held in Paris with funding largely from major French firms operating in China.\n\nAppendix 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020615",
