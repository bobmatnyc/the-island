  "text": "The roboticist Rodney Brooks, featured in Errol Morris’s 1997 documentary Fast,\nCheap and Out of Control along with a lion-tamer, a topiarist, and an expert on the\nnaked mole rat, was described by one reviewer as “smiling with a wild gleam in his eye.’\nBut that’s pretty much true of most visionaries.\n\nA few years later in his career, Brooks, as befits one of the world’s leading\nroboticists, suggested that “we overanthropomorphize humans, who are after all mere\nmachines.” He went on to present a warm-hearted vision of a coming Al world in which\n“the distinction between us and robots is going to disappear.” He also admitted to\nsomething of a divided worldview. “Like a religious scientist, I maintain two sets of\ninconsistent beliefs and act on each of them in different circumstances,” he wrote. “It is\nthis transcendence between belief systems that I think will be what enables mankind to\nultimately accept robots as emotional machines, and thereafter start to empathize with\nthem and attribute free will, respect, and ultimately rights to them.”\n\nThat was in 2002. In these pages, he takes a somewhat more jaundiced, albeit\nnarrower, view; he is alarmed by the extent to which we have come to rely on pervasive\nsystems that are not just exploitative but also vulnerable, as a result of the too-rapid\ndevelopment of software engineering—an advance that seems to have outstripped the\nimposition of reliably effective safeguards.\n\nJ\n\n49\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016852",
