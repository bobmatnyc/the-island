I have to be\ndirect -- you or someone at your paper was very astute in checking the Clerk and Comptroller's computer\nand activity in the Epstein case two days before the hearing. As result, you sent me a text message on\nSaturday asking what the activity was about and I confirmed that the plea would take place. You were\nthe only member of the news media that I talked with. And yet, after the case is completely over, the\nPalm Beach Daily News' editorial staff remains silent on the topic.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\nPalm Beach Post Editorial\nMonday, July 07, 2008\n\nTwo years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein\nfinally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 million, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for\nsex. A week ago, the 55-year-old investment banker began serving 18 months in jail.\n\nBut that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for\nprostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually\nabused them. And why is Epstein serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state\nprison, where inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_03031 1",
