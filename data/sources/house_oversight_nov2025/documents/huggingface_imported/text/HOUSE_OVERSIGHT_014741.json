One transmission channel is\nthat turning points usually anticipate monetary policy changes. The most reliable leading\nindicators available summarize a battery of activity, financial and qualitative variables.\nOne example is the set of Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) calculated by the OECD,\nwhich is heavily used by policy makers and market participants.\n\nThe problem that we have with leading indicators is they are not really useful to market\nparticipants because they move after the market does. That is, leading indicators\nanticipate growth but not the market because they use financial variables to anticipate\ngrowth. Leading indicators rely heavily on interest rates, stock market indexes and\nexchange rates because they incorporate vast information quickly.\n\nLILI solves the problem in two dimensions. It is not based on financial variables. Rather,\nLILI is based on qualitative data, consumer and business confidence, which we believe\nare optimal to capture “animal spirits.” And, it is constructed explicitly to anticipate the\nCLI, as we use a dynamic forecasting regression with lags of consumer and business\nconfidence to calculate LILI.\n\nThe signal for early 2017\n\nLILI indicates that in early 2017 global growth will continue with an improving economic\noutlook (Chart 23). Consumers and firms seem to be bullish around the world, because\nLILI anticipates an even stronger outlook than the CLI. Here global growth means\ngrowth in the OECD plus the six largest non-OECD members. LILI anticipates the CLI by\nfour months, and the CLI in turn anticipates growth by three months.\n\nLILI supports our house view of higher rates and reflation, as the peak of the business\ncycle is not in the forecasting horizon. Since LILI is not based on market measures, we\nare confident that LILI anticipates market movements as well.\n\nChart 23: LILI is our leading indicator of leading indicators that leads growth by 7 months and OECD’s CLI by 4 months\n\n103\n101\n99 ‘\nee QECD + 6 LILI\n97 e=e=eQECD + 6 CLI\n«=== OECD +6 growth\n\nJan-06 Jan-08 Jan-10 Jan-12 Jan-14 Jan-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, OECD.
