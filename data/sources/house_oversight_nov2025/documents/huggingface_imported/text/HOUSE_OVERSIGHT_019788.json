  "text": "300 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nThe conversation that Snowden began is necessary for another\nreason. The relentless growth of data-collection technology had\ncome to endanger personal privacy. Smart phones in our pockets,\nGPS recorders in our cars, fitness bands on our wrists, CCTV moni-\ntors in stores, and network-connected devices in our homes leave a\ndigital trail of every move we make. The government can subpoena\nas part of an investigation, as we know, our personal data, including\nour Internet searches, social media postings, electronic communica-\ntions, and credit card records. In addition, the government has its\nown tools of surveillance. Snowden, by disclosing that the govern-\nment was vacuuming in phone billing records and Internet activi-\nties, hit a sore spot in the public’s consciousness.

East Germany was not the only place in the Cold War era\nusing surveillance to suppress dissent. Even in the United States\nin the 1950s and 1960s, J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI bugged the phones\nof civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr, to root out\nsuspected subversive elements. Most Americans viewed this as a\nreprehensible use of government surveillance, and the very men-\ntion of the word, even before Snowden’s disclosure, evoked disquiet\namong the public. But what Snowden exposed was not any sort of\nrogue operation but programs authorized by the president and Con-\ngress and approved by fifteen federal judges.
