The state of the business cycle is a\nkey driver of market performance, evident in the\ntight linkage between the S&P 500 and the ISM\nManufacturing Index (see Exhibit 51). Notably, the\nS&P 500 has generated positive annual total returns\n86% of the time during economic expansions in the\npost-WWII period, while suffering annual declines\nof greater than 10% just 4% of the time. During\nthe same postwar period, nearly three-fourths of the\nbear markets—defined here as declines of 20% or\nmore—occurred during US recessions.\n\nWith few signs of an economic contraction\non the horizon, the high odds of positive returns\nand low odds of large losses raise the hurdle\nfor underweighting equities significantly. This is\nparticularly true because the risks are not one-\nsided: markets often surprise to the upside, too,\neven at high valuations. Last year was a case in\npoint: the S&P 500’s 12% return matched our\ngood-case scenario, although at the start of 2016\nwe had attached only 20% odds to it occurring.\n\nAs we consider the potential for similar upside\nsurprises in 2017, earnings growth tops the list for\nthree reasons. First, we expect the sizable profit\ndrag from energy earnings to reverse in 2017,\nwith scope for a greater than $4-5 contribution\nto S&P 500 EPS if recently announced global oil\nproduction cuts are realized. Keep in mind that this\ncontribution was closer to $15 prior to the collapse\n\nin oil prices. Second, a shift to a 25% corporate tax\nrate could add $9-10 to S&P 500 EPS in 2017 if\nenacted retroactively (see Exhibit 52). Finally, a tax\nholiday for the estimated $1 trillion of cash held\noverseas could lead to an additional $1-2 of EPS\nupside from repatriation-driven buybacks.\n\nThere are also other, less visible potential\ncatalysts for equities. Over the last 20 years, the\ntotal return of stocks has exceeded that of 10-year\nTreasury bonds by only 2 percentage points, well\nbelow the historical average of 4.4 percentage\npoints and a result that ranks in the bottom 20%\nof all post-WWII observations. But after similar\nperiods of underperformance, stocks generated\nwell above average relative returns over the\nnext three and five years (see Exhibit 53). Said\ndifferently, history suggests stock returns will\noutpace those of bonds, even if expected equity\nreturns are uninspiring.\n\nA related source of upside stems from the\nlopsided investor flows evident in Exhibit 54. Here,\neven moderate rebalancing out of bonds by retail\ninvestors—who represent 80% of mutual fund\nowners—would represent a sizable tailwind to\nequities. Historically, a shift in flows from bonds\ninto equities has been motivated by three factors:\nconfidence in the durability of the economic\nrecovery, unattractive prospects for bond returns\nand higher equity prices (see Exhibit 55). Our\ncentral case features all three factors, suggesting the\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 53\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014586",
