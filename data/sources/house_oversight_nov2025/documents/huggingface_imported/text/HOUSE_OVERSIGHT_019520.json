  "text": "32 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nStevens, the assistant registrar of UMUC, who I spoke to at the base\nin 2016, told me that the program in 2009 did not provide gradu-\nate courses in computer sciences. According to the program’s record,\nwhile Snowden had enrolled as a student in the summer of 2009, he\nreceived neither any credits nor a certificate.\n\nIn October 2009, Dell assigned Snowden a job in which he had\ndirect access to the NSA’s computers. He was now a system adminis-\ntrator, which is essentially a tech-savvy repairman. Dell was working\non a backup system code-named EPICSHELTER. For this contract,\nDell was transferring large chunks of data from the NSA’s main\ncomputers in Maryland to backup drives in Japan so that the system\ncould be quickly restored if there was a communications interrup-\ntion, Because most of the classified data was in its encrypted form, it\nhad little value to any outside party. Snowden’s job was to maintain\nthe proper functioning of computers, but as a system administrator\nhe also had privileges to call up unencrypted files. He sat in front of a\ncomputer screen all day looking for any problems in the transferring\nof files to backup servers.\n\n© The work was highly repetitive and exceedingly dull. Snowden ©\nfound time to search for anomalies in the system, and he claimed\nto have spotted a major flaw in the security system in late 2009. He\ndiscovered that a rogue system administrator in Japan could steal\nsecret data without anyone else’s realizing that it had been stolen.\nSnowden brought that to the attention of his superiors, as he later\nsaid,\n\nThe emergence of a rogue system administrator was not that far-\nfetched in 2009. Hacktivists such as Julian Assange had adopted the\nbattle cry “Sysadmins of the world, unite.” Instead of asking them\nto “throw off their chains,” as Marx did, he asked them to send clas-\nsified documents about secret government activity to the WikiLeaks\nsite. Snowden, as a “sys admin,” was aware he had the power to do\nso. He recalled in Moscow in 2014, “I actually recommended they\n[the NSA] move to two-man control for administrative access back\nin 2009.” To make his point even clearer, he added, “A whistleblower\ncould use these things, but so could a spy.” Not without irony,\nSnowden became that rogue system administrator some three years\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 32 ® 9/30/16 11:09 AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019520",
