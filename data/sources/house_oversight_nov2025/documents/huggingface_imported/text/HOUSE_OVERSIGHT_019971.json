  "text": "through-the-eye-of-the-needle accomplishment—without unique astuteness and cunning.\nRight? In the early days of the White House, this was the fundamental hypothesis of the\nsenior staff, shared by Walsh and everyone else: Trump must know what he was doing, his\nintuition must be profound.\n\nBut then there was the other aspect of his supposedly superb insight and apprehension,\nand it was hard to miss: he was often confident, but he was just as often paralyzed, less a\nsavant in these instances than a figure of sputtering and dangerous insecurities, whose\ninstinctive response was to lash out and behave as if his gut, however silent and confused,\nwas in fact in some clear and forceful way telling him what to do.\n\nDuring the campaign, he became a kind of vaunted action figure. His staff marveled at\nhis willingness to keep moving, getting back on the plane and getting off the plane and\ngetting back on, and doing rally after rally, with a pride in doing more events than\nanybody else—double Hillary’s!—and ever ridiculing his opponent’s slow pace. He\nperformed. “This man never takes a break from being Donald Trump,” noted Bannon,\nwith a complicated sort of faint praise, a few weeks after joining the campaign full time.\n\nIt was during Trump’s early intelligence briefings, held soon after he captured the\nnomination, that alarm signals first went off among his new campaign staff: he seemed to\nlack the ability to take in third-party information. Or maybe he lacked the interest;\nwhichever, he seemed almost phobic about having formal demands on his attention. He\nstonewalled every written page and balked at every explanation. “He’s a guy who really\nhated school,” said Bannon. “And he’s not going to start liking it now.”\n\nHowever alarming, Trump’s way of operating also presented an opportunity to the\npeople in closest proximity to him: by understanding him, by observing the kind of habits\nand reflexive responses that his business opponents had long learned to use to their\nadvantage, they might be able to game him, to move him. Still, while he might be moved\ntoday, nobody underestimated the complexities of continuing to move him in the same\ndirection tomorrow.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nOne of the ways to establish what Trump wanted and where he stood and what his\nunderlying policy intentions were—or at least the intentions that you could convince him\nwere his—came to involve an improbably close textual analysis of his largely off-the-cuff\nspeeches, random remarks, and reflexive tweets during the campaign.\n\nBannon doggedly went through the Trump oeuvre highlighting possible insights and\npolicy proscriptions. Part of Bannon’s authority in the new White House was as keeper of\nthe Trump promises, meticulously logged onto the white board in his office. Some of these\npromises Trump enthusiastically remembered making, others he had little memory of, but\nwas happy to accept that he had said it. Bannon acted as disciple and promoted Trump to\nguru—or inscrutable God.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019971",
