  "text": "new faces which we then love and hate. Instead, every interpersonal arrangement\nis new, suspect and run on a cash-and-carry basis. We are made to feel like there\nare no seats for us inside of them. Even Debbie, with her history of selfless motherly\ndevotion to her “children,” felt like an empty husk, encased in the exoskeletal armor\nof compulsive correctness. With their inner life unpeopled, the best we on the\noutside can hope for is to be valuable to them as tools, like forks and chairs.\n\nIn new and potentially therapeutic settings, for example a genuinely loving\nfoster family, these children manipulate, testing for the feared loss and abuse that\nfirst generated their detachment. They provoke the very mistrust they fear. The\nsexually exploited child is seductive. The physically abused child provokes attack.\nPersonality constellations which can be adaptive, when narrowed and fixated,\nbecome impediments to new and reparative experience. It is in this way that\npersonality disorders are self-maintaining.\n\nAn irony is that these interpersonally empty and rigid patterns in personality\ntend to occur in the most constitutionally robust of the abused and neglected\nchildren. They are those who have escaped early death from failure to thrive,\nsevere neuropsychological impairment, chronic depression, severe social\nwithdrawal or the pediatric psychotic disorders. The children with sufficient flexibility\nto adapt quickly and survive often settle into empty-centered rigid caricatures of\nadult personality styles.\n\nOf course, well-defined and characteristic personality patterns do not require\nabandonment and abuse or the pathological simplification of traumatic deforestation\nof neuronal connectivities in order to emerge. Demanding social selection of\nparticular personality proclivities that are competitively advantageous for highly\nsought positions also results in the appearance of well-defined personality styles.\n\nno tt\n\nCommon examples are the technical types, “techies,” “nerds,” whose work require\nlong hours alone to master and execute, as in doing mathematical proofs, solving\nproblems in theoretical physics, unraveling computer programming problems or\nwriting highly technical tracks. These activities can be aided by the personality\ninclinations of shyness and distantiation, the experience of discomfort in social\n\noccasions along with a rich private fantasy life.
