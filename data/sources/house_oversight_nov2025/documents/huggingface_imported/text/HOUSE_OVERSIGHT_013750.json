  "text": "alcoholism (Ehlers et al, 1995); do these approaches suggest a new neural\ndynamical mechanism for the actions of anticonvulsant drugs (Zimmerman et al,\n1991); can these measures made on non-verbal, psychomotor tasks yield a non-\nintrusive measure of personality and character (Selz, 1992); can these approaches\nto deviant patterns of psychomotor sequencing in schizophrenics give us some\ninsight into potential (cerebeller-basal ganglia?) mechanisms of the thought disorder\nin schizophrenia (Paulus et al, 1994); does cocaine induce new patterns of behavior\nthat conserve pre-treatment entropy in developing animals (Smotherman et al,\n1996); will these quantities applied to objective gait observables supply early\ndiagnoses and quantification of clinical course in patients with extra-pyramidal\ndisorders or taking anti-psychotic medication (Hausdorff et al, 1998); can these\ntransformations of time series on the EEG give us an early diagnostic approach to\nAlzheimer’s disease (Jeong et al, 1998) or a new acute preventive pharmacological\n\napproach to patients with psychomotor and partial seizures (lasemidis et al, 1990).\n\nTo end where we began: We think that if neuroscientists “did their own”\nnonlinear dynamical theory and analysis, shaped and tailored by intuitions growing\nout of their own experimental work and thinking, abstract and philosophical\nquestions about what is determinism and what is random would retreat in favor of\nnew specific ideas and experiments about brain dynamical mechanisms and their\npathophysiology. From the studies reviewed here, it appears that a robust move in\n\nthis direction in the brain sciences is well underway.\n\n250\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013750",
