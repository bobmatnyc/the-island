  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54039\n\nentitled to deference under the analysis\nset forth in Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Under\nChevron, where Congress has not\n“directly addressed the precise question\nat issue,”’ id. at 842-843, that\nrulemaking authority may be used in\norder “‘to fill any gap left, implicitly or\nexplicitly, by Congress.” Id. at 843.\n\nEven assuming that the absence of an\nexplicit posting requirement in the\nNLRA is not interpreted as clear\nexpression of Congressional intent, the\nmajority fails to persuade that Congress\ndelegated authority in Section 6 of the\nNLRA for the Board to fill a putative\nstatutory gap by promulgating a rule\nthat an employer commits an unfair\nlabor practice by failing to affirmative\nnotify its employees of their rights\nunder the NLRA. As the Supreme Court\nhas explained, ‘the ultimate question is\nwhether Congress would have intended,\nand expected, courts to treat [the\nregulation] as within, or outside, its\ndelegation to the agency of ‘gap-filling’\nauthority.” Long Island Care at Home,\nLtd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 173 (2007).\n\nThere is no doubt that there are many\ngaps and ambiguities in the NLRA that\nCongress intended for the Board to\naddress, using its labor expertise, either\nthrough adjudication or rulemaking.\nHowever, the existence of ambiguity in\na statute is not enough per se to warrant\ndeference to the agency’s interpretation\nof its authority in every respect. The\nambiguity must be such as to make it\nappear that Congress either explicitly or\nimplicitly delegated authority to cure\nthat ambiguity. Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC,\n430 F.3d 457, 469 (D.C. Cir. 2005);\nMotion Picture Ass’n of America, Inc. v.\nFCC, 309 F. 3d 796, 801 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n(“MPAA ’’) (“agency’s interpretation of\n[a] statute is not entitled to deference\nabsent a delegation of authority from\nCongress to regulate in the areas at\nissue.”’).\n\nThus, even when an administrative\nagency seeks to address what it believes\nis a serious interpretive problem, the\nSupreme Court has said that the agency\n“may not exercise its authority ‘in a\nmanner that is inconsistent with the\nadministrative structure that Congress\nenacted into law.’’’ FDA v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S.\n120, 125(2000) (quoting ETSI Pipeline\nProject v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 495,\n517(1988)). Further, the statute at issue\nmust be considered as a “symmetrical\nand coherent regulatory scheme.”’\nGustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561,\n569, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1\n(1995). In our case, the exercise of\nrulemaking authority under Section 6 is\nnot self-effectuating; it must be shown\n\nto relate reasonably to some other\nprovision as part of the overall statutory\nscheme contemplated by Congress.175\n\nNothing in the text or the regulatory\nstructure of the NLRA suggests that the\nBoard has the authority to promulgate\nthe notice-posting rule at issue in order\nto address a gap in the statutory scheme\nfor resolving questions concerning\nrepresentation through Section 9, or in\npreventing, through Sections 8 and 10,\nspecifically enumerated unfair labor\npractices that adversely affect\nemployees’ Section 7 rights. On the\ncontrary, it is well-established that the\nBoard lacks independent authority to\ninitiate or to solicit the initiation of\nrepresentation and unfair labor practice\nproceedings, and Section 10(a) limits\nthe Board’s powers to preventing only\nthe unfair labor practices listed in\nSection 8 of the Act. Yet the majority\nasserts that it may exceed these\nlimitations by requiring employers to\npost a notice of employee rights and\nillustrative unfair labor practices at all\ntimes, regardless of whether a petition\nhad been filed or an employer has been\nfound to have committed an unfair labor\npractice.\n\nThe majority’s reliance on a\ncombination of Section 7, 8, and 10\nwarrants special mention. They reason\nthat an employer interferes with Section\n7 rights in general, and thereby violates\nSection 8(a)(1), by failing to give\ncontinuous notice to employees of those\nrights. It may be a truism that an\nemployee must be aware of his rights in\norder to exercise them, but it does not\nfollow that it is the employer under our\nstatutory scheme who must provide\nenlightenment or else incur liability for\nviolating those rights. The new unfair\nlabor practice created by the rule bears\nno reasonable relation to any unfair\nlabor practice in the NLRA’s pre-\nexisting enforcement scheme developed\nover seven decades.!77 It certainly bears\n\n176 See, e.g., Mourning v. Family Publications\nService, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, (1973) Unlike here, the\nFederal Reserve Board easily met this standard in\nMourning when issuing a disclosure regulation\nunder the Truth in Lending Act, even though that\nAct did not explicitly require lenders to make such\ndisclosures. In sustaining the regulation, the Court\nound the regulation to be within the Federal\nReserve’s rulemaking authority and, in light of the\negislative history, the disclosure requirement was\nnot contrary to the statute. ‘The crucial distinction,\n* * * [was that] the disclosure requirement was in\nact enforced through the statute’s pre-existing\nremedial scheme and in a manner consistent with\nit.” Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535\nU.S. 81, 94 (2002).\n\n177 The Senate report on the Wagner bill stressed\nthat unfair labor practices were “‘strictly limited to\nthose enumerated in section 8. This is made clear\nby paragraph 8 of section 2, which provides that\n‘The term ‘unfair labor practice’ means unfair labor\npractice listed in Section 8,” and by Section 10(a)\nempowering the Board to prevent any unfair labor\n\nno relation to the few examples the\nmajority can muster in Board precedent.\nThe only instance with even a passing\nresemblance to the rights notice-posting\nrequirement here is the requirement that\na union give notice of Beck 178 and\nGeneral Motors 17° rights. However, the\nfailure to give such a notice is not per\nse unlawful. It becomes an unfair labor\npractice only when a union, without\ngiving notice, takes the affirmative\naction of seeking to obligate an\nemployee to pay fees and dues under a\nunion-security clause.18° Beyond that, a\nunion has no general obligation to give\nemployees notice of their Beck and\nGeneral Motors rights; much less does it\nviolate the NLRA by failing to do so. By\ncontrast, the rule promulgated today\nimposes a continuing obligation on\nemployers to post notice of employees’\ngeneral rights and, even absent any\naffirmative act involving those rights,\nmakes the failure to maintain such\nnotice unlawful.181\n\nUnlike my colleagues, I find that the\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Local 357,\nTeamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961),\nspeaks directly to this point. In that\ncase, the Board found a hiring hall\nagreement unlawfully discriminatory\nper se because, even though it included\nan express anti-discrimination\n\npractice “listed in Section 8.” Thus, “[nJeither the\nNational Labor Relations Board nor the courts are\ngiven any blanket authority to prohibit whatever\nlabor practices that in their judgment are deemed\nto be unfair.” S. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n17 (1935) at 8-9 reprinted in Legislative History of\nthe National Labor Relations Act of 1935, Vol. Hat\n2307-2308 (1985).\n\n178 Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U.S.\n735 (1988).\n\n179 NLRB v. General Motors, 373 U.S. 734 (1963).\n\n180 California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224,\n233 (1995).\n\n181 None of the FMLA cases cited by the majority\nsupport finding that a failure to post a general\nnotice of employee rights under the NLRA is\nunlawful. In Bachelder, the Ninth Circuit actually\nound “unavailing” the employer’s argument that it\nhad satisfied all its specific FMLA notice\nobligations because it had complied with the\nFMLA’s general posting rule. Id. at 1127, In. 5.\nRather, the court found that because the employer\nailed to “notify” an employee which of the four\nFMLA’s “leave year” calculation methods it had\nchosen, the employer “interfered” with that\nemployee’s rights and, therefore, improperly used\nhe employee’s FMLA covered absences as a\n“negative factor’ when taking the affirmative\nadverse action of discharging her.\n\nSimilarly, in neither Greenwell v. Charles\nMachine Works, Inc., 2011 WL 1458565 (W.D.Okla.,\n2011); Smith v. Westchester County, 769 F. Supp 2d\n448 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), was the FMLA general posting\nrequirement at issue. Smith did not involve a notice\nissue and Greenwell involved the employer’s failure\nto comply with a different notification obligation\nunder the FMLA.\n\nIn any event, as previously stated, FMLA\nexpressly provides that employers give notice to\nemployees of rights thereunder and expressly\nprovides for sanctions if notice is not given. The\nNLRA does neither.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022310",
