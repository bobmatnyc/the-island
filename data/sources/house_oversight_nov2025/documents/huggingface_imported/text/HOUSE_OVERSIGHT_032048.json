  "text": "From: \nSent: \nTo: \nJeffrey Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] \n4/12/2014 11:24:06 AM \nThese conspiracy theories are an aberration and an insult to the memory of the crash victims, including the late \nPresident himself As a Pole who is at least somewhat aware of the politics and economics of Poland, and a \njournalist who follows world politics and news developments daily, I am severely disappointed at the number of \npeople that are flocking to these conspiracy theories, and academics and professionals who propagate such ideas \nshould themselves feel ashamed. \nFirstly, there is absolutely no proof that there was any sabotage or subterfuge by either the Russians or the \nPrime Minister's political allies. Such accusations, then, without presenting any credible evidence, are \nslanderous. \nAlso, there would be no political or diplomatic capital gained by either of the \"accused\"... there would be little \nfor the Russian government to gain - it would be a huge diplomatic embarrassment for the Russian government \nto be found guilty of essentially assassinating a head of state. Kaczynski was one of the strongest allies of the \nU.S. among European leaders, and even Russia with its assertive diplomatic policies would not risk a complete \nbreakdown with the U.S. by killing a close ally. International condemnation would also follow, and the \nPresident - perhaps even the Prime Minister - would have to resign and wave good-bye to any political career in \nthe foreseeable future. Yes, \"even in Russia.\" \nSimilarly, for the Prime Minister's party, if he were actually complicit in the crash, that would mean he - or his \nallies - committed a coup d'etat. Also, there will be early presidential elections in June, which might actually go \nin favor of the President's party because of a sympathy vote. The \"acting\" Presidency is in the hands of his party \nfor only two months... so, again, the Prime Minister and his allies have nothing to gain and potentially \neverything to lose in the June vote. \nConspiracy-monging cheapens a national tragedy \nPolitical profit or loss questions aside, however, the conspiracy-monging seems to be taken as a way to discover \nwho's responsible for the tragedy and thus somehow bring them justice. However, it is not a healthy way to deal \nwith the tragedy. It is not conducive to national or personal healing. Furthermore, it disgraces and taints the \nmemory of those who died. \nIt only cheapens the tragedy and, sadly, may foreshadow what's to come in the coming presidential campaign - \nthe tragedy may be used by certain groups or individuals to propagate their own agenda and assume the \npresidency. \nIt is not so different than what has been going on in the U.S., with the \"birthers\" claiming Barack Obama is not \nlegally the President because he is not actually a citizen, or even natural-born citizen. Not as morbid, of course, \nbut still, in my honest opinion, ridiculous. \nBaseless, nonsensical conspiracies simply destroys the abiltiy of the nation and people of Poland to move on \nand honor the memory of those lost, and cheapens the tragedy that has been felt by Poles as far away as Chicago \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 032048 \nas well, and commented on with deep sorrow and respect by U.S. politicians from Mayor Daley to President \nObama himself \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
