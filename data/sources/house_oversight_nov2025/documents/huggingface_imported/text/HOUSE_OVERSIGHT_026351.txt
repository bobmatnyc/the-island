Hi Jeffrey,

Sorry for the phone tag. In case it's easier to respond by email, | have put my questions below. I'm at my desk and should be
here until 5, and should be free on my cell phone after 6:30.

Best,

Alex

-what is the square footage of your Manhattan home?

-do you work on alaptop from your dining room, with a large white board for notes and several pairs of reading glasses close at
hand? Is the dining room windowless?

-do paparazzi often camp outside your home?

-did Michael once visit on the same day as a head of state who'd had a police escort?

-did you tell Michael about a dinner you'd hosted for six tech entrepreneurs who had a combined worth of several hundred
billion dollars? When was this meal?

-Do you believe that there are now more people who possess Roosevelt or Carnegie-levels of wealth, the sort that can rival
governments in influence? That these people face unusual challenges when entering philanthropy due to the sheer size of
their fortunes? That the rich may know the business that made them rich, but not money itself?

-are you interested in what will happen to the $4.2 trillion possessed by the super-rich in 40-odd years once they have mostly
died?

-Do you believe no superrich people want to give their entire fortunes to their children for fear of how it might affect them?
-do you advise the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on how to convince other billionaires to join their initiatives?

-did you volunteer to invest $20 million dollars in Michael's attempt to buy New York Magazine in 2004?

-do you believe the recent claims about Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew in relation to you are "ludicrous" ?

-When you met Michael for lunch in the West Village, was it the first time in 10 years you'd gone to lunch at a restaurant?

-Do you have a support staff of young women in their 20s and 30s? Have some of them worked for you for many years, through
their own marriages and as they raise families? Have any of these employees been romantically involved with you? When
Michael came to your home, had one of these women recently gone on an around the world honeymoon, which you
arranged? Do they often travel with you to your other homes — in New Mexico, Paris, Palm Beach, and in the Caribbean? Do
you maintain there is no quid-pro-quo in the relationships with these women? Do these women often socialize with the policy
makers and businessmen with whom you often meet?

-Is your current girlfriend a dental student you met four years ago at a dinner party in New York?

-Did you date Eva Andersson Dubin? Have you known her for 30 years? Did you pay for her to go to medical school?

-when you take meetings in your Manhattan dining room, do you take your guests out to a Sabrett hot dog cart? Will the
women who work for you accompany you?

-Did you invite Michael to sit inon a presentation by a group of quants? Are you looking for a group of quants who have
developed promising investing algorithms, and do you plan to invest $5 million with each?
