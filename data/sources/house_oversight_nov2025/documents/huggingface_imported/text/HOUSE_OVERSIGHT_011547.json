Even if we managed to avoid getting captured, without completely\ncamouflaging what we’d done, the Egyptians would discover what we had\ndone, almost certainly tipping off Syria as well to our bugging operations on the\nGolan Heights.\n\nThe difficulties with a Sinai operation weren’t just theoretical. Almost a year\nbefore leading the first mission on the Golan, I’d actually been involved in\npreliminary planning, and fairly detailed training, for such a mission in the\nSinai. We’d ended up abandoning the idea as obviously unworkable.\n\nBut Meir Amit, not just our unit’s overall commander in the kirya but Chief\nof Operations during Rotem, recognized that getting intelligence access to\nEgypt was central to Israeli security. He was intent on reviving the plan to tap\ninto Nasser’s communications in the Sinai. So was Avraham Arnan. He enlisted\nthe backing of an old friend, Uri Yarom, who was now commander of the Israeli\nAir Force and was eager to put our fleet of recently acquired Sikorsky S-58\nhelicopters to operational use. When Avraham called me in to tell me what he\nhad in mind, he began by saying it would be “by far the greatest challenge\nwe ve contemplated” — typically disarming candor, but also a challenge which\nI’m pretty sure he knew would only increase my determination to at least try.\nThe flight in would be difficult enough. Israel had never before tried such a\nheliborne mission. But he told me that wasn’t my problem. “That will be Uri’s\njob.” The really testing part would be to carry out an mission, at night, deep\ninside Egypt, cover our tracks and get out again in one piece. “Still, I’m sure\nthat we can succeed,” he said. “And I want you and your team to do it.”\n\nEven now, more than half-a-century later, some of the details of how we\nplanned to tap into the Egyptians’ communications remain classified. But once\nI’d chosen my team of sayeret soldiers for the mission, we trained for nearly\nnine months. We drafted in geologists to identify areas of the Negev similar to\nthe terrain we’d find in the Sinai. We developed a series of methods to prevent\nEgyptian soldiers or scouts from discovering that we’d been there — assuming,\nof course, we managed to get in, attach the intercept, and return safely. It was a\nrelentless process of trial... and error.\n\nOne of the many reasons we’d abandoned the plan a couple of years earlier\nwas that, in a nighttime exercise to see whether we could avoid detection by\nIsrael’s own crack desert scouts, we'd failed utterly. Now, after many weeks of\ntraining in the Negev, we did, finally, succeed — in a test running for four\n\n76\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011547",
