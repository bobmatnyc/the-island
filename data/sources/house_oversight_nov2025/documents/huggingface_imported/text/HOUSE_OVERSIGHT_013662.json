  "text": "run to other graduate fields such as biology and medicine and come to resist the\npotentially humiliating incursions of new and potentially helpful abstract ideas and\noperations from mathematics and physics into their fields. They do not want their\npersecutory versions of Mr. Kirby to take up residence once again in their heads. |\ncan still feel his negative presence during long hours of struggle with the ego\ndeflating feelings of dumbness that an understanding of almost any new\nmathematical concept requires of me. Holding Mr. Kirby’s voice off as long as | can\nuntil, sometimes, the wonderful “aha!” experience arrives. | have tried to forgive him\nsince but forgetting him has not been possible.\n\nIt turns out that in the world of elementary, physically representative, real\nnumbers, the square root of a negative number has no meaning. Such a number\nhas understandably come to be called imaginary. Was this the answer Mr. Kirby\n\nwanted? There was some conflict among mathematicians in the 17\" and 18\"\nCentury about the arbitrary definition of V-las an imaginary number. |t was\n\nsymbolized by a letter, /, that is J-1 =i. The existence of i extended the range of\nalgebraic definitions so that a solution of the quadratic formula as above could be\nfound for the square root of a negative number. A further expansion of this idea was\nto that of a complex number that can have both a real and an imaginary part. For\nexample, letting letters be generalized representations of numbers, a complex\nnumber might be written, a + bi, real number a + real number b times /, the letters\nsuch as a, b, c, d... symbolized real numbers. Consistent with membership in an\nalgebraic system, a + bi and c + di can be added and multiplied. This extension of\nthe real numbers into the imaginary realm permitted d’Alembert’s and Gauss’s\nproofs (and many, more complete ones since) of the powerful Fundamental\nTheorem of Algebra from which the faith derives about always being able to find at\nleast one solution to an algebraic equation. It was proven that any n” degree\nalgebraic equation (e.g. x\"+x\"'+...=0) with real or complex coefficients always\nhas at least one real or complex root.\n\nCloser to an image that helps make intuitive connections with human born\nagain bifurcations, limit cycles and directional splitting is the geometric interpretation\n\nof a complex number, let us now call it z. As above, algebraically, z is the sum of a\n\n162\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013662",
