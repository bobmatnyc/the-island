  "text": "Both films are sensational and movie goers go nuts, but it is \"The King's Speech\" that edges out the\ncompetition for The Audience Prize.\n\nMid-November David 0. Russell and Mark Wahlberg, working together for the third time, sneak \"The Fighter\"\nin Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor wahlberg, \"Clint Eastwood is\ngoing to kill himself for not directing this.\" wahlberg says, “You are wrong. He turned it down because\nhe's done it. He has seen it and he loves it.\" I instantly lavish my affection and praise on David oO.\nRussell, who becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting\nactors to beat.\n\n“True Grit\" directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin doesn't premiere till mid-\nDecember at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box\noffice gold.\n\nThis is the year many of the 78 million Baby Boomers go back to the theaters. Five small budget\nindependent films become surprise hits as each exceeds $100 million.\n\n“The Social Network\" now cements its battle cry with one word; “relevance”. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the\ncover of Time Magazine as The Person of the Year. A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in\nthe lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. “The Social Network\" is the clear winner.\nEveryone goes on holiday.\n\nThis is probably the only time in Harvey Weinstein'’s life that he is caught off guard. He quickly\nmobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They\nbecome like a Chinese Restaurant...always open. A generational war is in full swing. Harvey screens his\nfilm for the older voters. Everything is done by the books. Budgets are limited. He sends screenwriter\nDavid Seidler and Tom Hoooper to every corner of the country doing gqta’s till they are blue in the face\nfrom \"finding their voice.\" SAG voters begin seeing the film 2 and 3 times.\n\nIn January the Golden Globes voted on by about 88 foreign journalists gives Best Drama to “The Social\nNetwork\", Best Director to David Fincher and Best Screenplay to Aaron Sorkin. Their film is still\nperceived as the Oscar winner.\n\nTeam Weinstein underestimates their hard work and is in shock when \"The King's Speech\" wins the PGA jin\nL.A. Harvey doesn’t even attend and is working in Sundance. They are equally surprised when Tom Hooper\nwins the DGA and the actors win the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced the lead. They are now the front\nrunner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on.\n\nThe Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of “The\nKing’s Speech” and is \"moved\" by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, the\nWeinstein Company sends out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. They also\nacknowledge Prime Minister David Cameron’s private Christmas screening.\n\nOn Oscar night, it isn't until Hilary Swank surprisingly yells out Hooper's name for Best Director that\nHarvey's gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture. The King has spoken.\n\nFriday, February 24th\n\nMid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel, where I have stayed for thirty years. As the housekeepers\nunpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge and find icon Warren Beatty in a booth. He motions me\nover to meet an Egyptian fashion editor from Cairo. I say, “Warren, you are a little late to visit\nCairo.\" I tell him I'm rooting for Annette and love her film “The Kids Are All Right”. Warren tells me\n“The Social Network” will win.\n\nThis year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am now shown to a very very very small room,\nthe size of a broom closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The housekeepers\nrun down the hall with my clothes flying. I calm down. The hotel is sold out. I get someone else's room.\nAnother poor schmuck checking in downstairs will get the broom closet.\n\nIt is cold, grey and rainy. Taffata, organdy and embroidered silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I\nstay in my sweaters and fur coat and head to Arianna Huffington's Mediterranean house in Beverly Hills\nwhere Wendi Murdoch and Arianna are hosting a party for Tom Freston's wife, the beautiful blond Kathy.\nThe book is called \"Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the world. A perfect book for Monks.\n\nArianna has just sold the Huffington Post for to AOL to $315 million dollars and rumored to have\npersonally landed around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the\ndoor. Other drenched power players ushered in under umbrellas include Disney's Bob Iger and wife willow\nBay, Fox’s Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google's Eric Schmidt,\nOliver Stone avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen and escorting his daughter Tara, Moby, Jamie Niven,\nBrian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, Tracey Ullman, CBS’s Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad\nGrey and fiancé Cassandra Mare and Jeff Bezos. Hors d'oeuvres include pigs in blankets, a food group not\nmentioned in Kathy's book.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029774",
