  "text": "doesn’t make sense to most sane people but after all of the time spent\nwith them, I had gotten to understand a few of their quirky ways. Even if\nI didn’t agree with them, they knew I would for their sake of opinion.\nWhat did it matter anyways I thought, I had been degraded in every other\nphysical way what's the difference from taking their mental abuse too.\nNot the exact choice of employers [ would’ve chosen over again if given\nthe opportunity but here I was and doing my very best to excel at their\ndemands.\n\nI was sent home for a little over a week to pack for the long trip and\nmake the rounds visiting my family before I left overseas on my first trip\nall by myself. It was great to see my family after such a long time away.\nMy older brother and his wife even came down to visit for the well\nwishing of my departure. Everyone in my family seemed stoked at the\nprospects my long journey had led me down. Here I was jet setting\naround the world in my teens and getting paid to study the course of my\ndreams at a cost that I only knew I would have to pay. It was a wonderful\nget together with all of them around, a great way to remember them. If I’d\nonly known it would be the last time I would see any of them I would’ve\nemphasized to my brothers how much I really loved them both and how\nmuch I would miss them in the decade to come! But I didn’t know what\nmy future held for me, I had nothing planned out I was just hoping for the\nright opportunities.\n\nlalso had a few good friends to catch up with before I went. Every ~\nnight was another party and by the end of the week I had drunken enough\nto drown an Irishman on St. Patty’s Day. I was given the lists to all of my\nfriends email address and told to keep in touch. Yeah right I thought, I\nwas going to be too busy having too much fun to be thinking about sitting\non a computer emailing people, but I told them 1 would anyways. Save\nmyself the point of having to explain that in many different ways to a\ngroup of already tipsy slurring teenagers. Out of everyone who was really\nhappy for me, T.J wasn’t. He hated the idea of me leaving him to havea\nnon-stop party in Thailand without him. He was just starting to seem like\nhe was coming good and I didn’t like having to leave him at such a\nvulnerable state but in my young years I had already realized I needed to\ndo some things for myself and this was one of them. There was still a\nhuge amount of broken trust between us, trust that could probably never\nbe rendered again so I thought I was being decent enough letting him stay\nat my apartment while 1 was gone, but he was not to drive my truck, at\nall. | paid too much money on insurance for that thing and knowing his\ndriving record | didn’t want the risk of something happening while I was\ngone for so long. He didn’t agree with me at all, throwing a grown up\ntantrum all over my apartment. Hitting the walls and doors, shouting the\nentire complex down, there was nothing I could say or do at this point in\n\n(2 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004250\n\ntime so J just put my dog on the lead and took her for a walk to calm\ndown the situation and give me some time to be alone. Mary Jane was the\nonly one I hated leaving behind. When we got back from the long walk\nshe barricaded my suitcase while I was packing the horrendous amount of\nclothing that I always did. I was promising her I wouldn’t be long and\ntold her how much I loved her giving her a big hug. I choked back on the\ntears that were swelling up in my eyes, it was like she already knew the\nnight before I flew out to New York that this would be my final trip.\n\nThere was a commercial flight booked for me in the morning and I\nneeded the rest that night to fully recover from my binge of celebration\ndrinking. T.J crept into bed later that night and tried to redeem his\nbehavior with sweet nothings and dry humping my backside. It did\nnothing for me sexually. | didn’t feel like that for him any longer and the\nsooner he realized that, the better he’d be off. I told him I wasn’t up for it\nand he picked up a pillow and slammed the door behind him. It didn’t\nmatter I told myself, the next day I was off and wouldn’t have to deal\nwith him or anyone.\n\nT.J caught a cab with me to MIA, the airport in Miami. He walked with\nme to the furthest point he was allowed to go by the security gates and as\nwe stood in line together it was almost heartbreaking seeing him cry. I\ntold him I’d try to call him everyday, attempting to give him optimistic\nways to look at this time away from each other. In the end he had me\ncrying and J had to give into my remaining feelings I had for him. One\nlast kiss under the x-ray bridge and he vanished out of my sight as I\nfurthered down the terminals long hall.\n\nChapter 20\n\nIt was only a short flight to New York and I just couldn’t wait until next\nweek when I’d be jetting of to an exotic destination all by my lonesome\nself. ft was all I could think about talk about and dream about, finally my\nbreak. Ghislane did what she did:best that week and prepped me for\neverything I could imagine under the sun. Do’s and Don’ts, emergency\nnumbers and western union locations were among some things on the list\nshe gave me. Like I said, she showed her caring side in other ways.\nThere was also the name of the girl I was supposed to be meeting, the\nroom she was in and what dates she would be staying there.\n\nWhen | got out of Ghislane’s office I was instructed to meet Jeffrey in\nhis office. She had to stay back for some paper work that she had to catch\nup on pronto.
