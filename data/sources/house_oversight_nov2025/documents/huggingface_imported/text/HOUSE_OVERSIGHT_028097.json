  "text": "When I got back, we immediately met with Rabin and agreed on the need to\nlaunch a formal investigation. Rabin then asked me to brief the “editors club”, a\ngroup of about 15 media figures that operated on a gentleman’s agreement that\nthere would be no publicity or leaks. He believed we should not make public the\nfact that I and other generals were there when the accident occurred. At this\nstage, we still hoped to hide the purpose of the exercise if possible, something\nRabin knew would be harder if it was known the top military leadership had\nobserved the exercise. When I briefed the editors’ club, I did tell them in\nconfidence that I’d been there. Though not specifying the reason for the\nexercise, I told them it was for a major operation. The time-honored\nunderstanding was that this information would go no further. But it did,\npresumably at first because of leaks by Israeli journalists, then in a series of\ndetailed reports in the foreign press. Even more frustrating on a personal level,\nsome of the Israeli reports insinuated that far from giving the editors the full\nstory of who had been at the Negev exercise, that I’d tried to hide my presence\nin order to protect my reputation or shirk responsibility.\n\nTwo official inquiries followed: the one we’d agreed with Rabin and a\nstandard army legal investigation. They found the cause of the tragedy to be a\nmix of fatigue after some of the soldiers had spent nearly 48 hours awake,\npressure, confusion and negligence. Astonishingly, it turned out the codeword\nfor the mock-firing of the missiles in the first stage of the exercise was the same\nas for the live missiles. Formal charges were brought against two Sayeret\nMatkal officers, and reprimands issued to Amiram Levin and Uri Saguy. I was\nalso subject to criticism because, due to the unique complexity of the plan, I’d\nput Amiram and senior officers within Sayeret Matkal in charge of different\naspects of the preparations. This was viewed as possibly reducing the clarity\nover who was ultimately responsible for each aspect of the planning. Neither I,\nnor of course Rabin, had played a direct role in what went wrong in the exercise\nitself. To the extent I’d been involved, it was to make sure the medical teams\nwere helicoptered in, and that the injured soldiers were cared for and evacuated\nas soon as possible. But politically, the tragedy at Tze’elim would dramatically\nresurface for both me and Rabin several years later — after I’d left the military\nand was on the verge of joining his government.\n\nI was getting to know Yitzhak much better. The Defense Minister’s office in\nthe kirva was just down the hall from mine. Almost without fail on Friday\nafternoons, he’d ask me in to chat before going home. We would sit around a\nlow table in the corner of the room, each of us sipping coffee, or sometimes\nbeer, and Rabin invariably puffing on a cigarette. He never raised questions of\n\n249\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028097",
