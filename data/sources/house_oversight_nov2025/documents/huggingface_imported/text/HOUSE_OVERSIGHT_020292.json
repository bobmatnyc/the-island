Wizner had joined the ACLU in August\n2001 after graduating NYU law school and clerking for a Federal judge. At the ACLU, he\nbecame an effective foe of NSA surveillance. “I had spent ten years before this [Snowden\nleak] trying to bring lawsuits against the intelligence community,” he explained in an\ninterview with Forbes in 2014. Prior to the Snowden leak, he had been consulted frequently by\nPoitras on government surveillance issues (and appeared in Poitras’ 2010 documentary “The\nOath.”) He had also been engaged in a law suit aimed at exposing the NSA’s subpoenas for\nVerizon records.\n\nHe had first learned about Snowden in early 2013, while Snowden was still working for the\nNSA, from Poitras. At that time, Poitras did not know Snowden’s real name, but she revealed to\nWizner that she had found an anonymous source with access to U.S. government surveillance\nsecrets. So he was not completely surprised when Glenn Greenwald, Poitras’ writing partner,\nasked him in July 2013 to contact Snowden in Russia.\n\nSnowden offered an opportunity for Wizner since the ACLU already had been pursuing a suit\nin Federal court against the government’s seizure of Verizon’s billing records. If he could induce\nSnowden to retain him and the ACLU, he could claim standing in Federal court to represent\nSnowden in the case. He also fully believed in the salutary benefit of Snowden’s revelations.\nThey communicated over Skype, according to Kucherena. When they discussed Snowden’s legal\nsituation in America, Snowden expressed an interest in obtaining some form of amnesty from\nprosecution in America. Wizner was willing to attempt to explore making a possible deal with the\nDepartment of Justice, but it would not be an easy task, especially if Snowden had turned over\nNSA documents to a foreign power.\n\nEven to argue that Snowden was merely a NSA whistle-blower presented a serious challenge\nfor Wizner. The ACLU had been involved with three previous NSA whistle-blowers, William E.\nBinney, Thomas A. Drake, and Russell D. Tice, but Snowden’s case differed from those cases in\nan important ways. Binney, Drake, and Tice had not intentionally taken any NSA documents.\nSnowden, on the other hand, had not only taken a large NSA documents but released tens of\nthousands of these top secret files to journalists based in Germany and Brazil as well as other\nunauthorized recipients. In addition, the Whistle Blower Protection Act, passed by Congress in\n1989, does not exempt an insider who signs a secrecy oath, such as Snowden, from the legal\nconsequences of disclosing classified documents to journalists or other unauthorized persons.\nConsequently, getting some form of amnesty for Snowden required changing Snowden’s public\nimage from that of a person who had damaged America to an image of a person who had helped\nAmerica. But if Snowden had taken even a single top secret document to Russia, the case could\nbe made that he had stolen communications intelligence secrets with intent to damage the United\nStates, which under the law could be considered espionage. In this regard, Kucherena’s\ndisclosure was extremely damaging to Snowden’s position.\n\nOne way to mitigate the damage from it was for Snowden to substitute a new narrative. In it,\nhe would say to say to hand-picked journalists that he had given all his documents to Poitras and\nGreenwald in Hong Kong and took none of them to Russia, Wizner could then argue that\ndocuments such as the FISA warrant were improperly classified secret and that disclosing them\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020292",
