  "text": "What’s it for?\n\nAbout 50 million years ago, a family of insects — the Phylliinae — evolved a distinctive piece of\nanatomy: a body that looks like a leaf. They also evolved the capacity for catalepsy or statuesque\nstillness. Their leafy body is so exquisitely designed that even predators with superb search images are\nfooled as they walk or fly by. But from the fact that the leafy body provides these insects with an\ninvisibility cloak, and the fact that this enables them to escape predation, we cannot conclude that the\nleafy body evolved for predator evasion. What something is used for today may be different from what it\nevolved for — the difference between current utility and original function. To show that the leafy body\nevolved for predator evasion, we need to know more, which we do. For one, the leafy body is paired up\nwith a requisite behavioral adaptation: turning to stone. If leaf insects fluttered about as actively as any\nother insect, their motion alone would cry out to the predators. Optimal effectiveness requires acting like\naleaf. But acting like a leaf without the leafy body has its own independent benefits, paying off in terms\nof predator evasion, as well as sneaking up on potential mates. It would therefore make good sense if\nstillness evolved first followed by a leafy body. This is precisely what evolution’s record reveals.\n\nThe adaptive advantage that comes from statuesque stillness and a leafy camouflage can only be\nmeasured against the backdrop of today’s predator line-up. If some future-predator evolves more\nsophisticated abilities to discriminate real leaves from faux leaves, the Phyllinae will be out of luck. This\nnew pressure from predators will, in turn, push for new evasive tricks, thus initiating the classic cycle of\npredator-prey evolution. What is adaptive for the Phylliinae today, may not be adaptive tomorrow.\n\nThe comparative study of the Phylliinae raises a class of questions posed by all evolutionary\nbiologists, independently of their taxonomic biases or interests in physiology, morphology, or behavior:\nHow did it originally evolve? What adaptive problem did it solve? Did it evolve to solve one adaptive\nproblem, but over time shift to solve another — a case of what the late evolutionary biologist Stephen J.\nGould referred to as an exaptation? Does the exaptation generate profits or losses for survival and\nreproduction? Is the trait associated with byproducts, incidental consequences of the evolutionary\nprocess? What effects, if any, do these byproducts have on survival and reproduction? These questions\napply with equal force to evil as they do to language, music, mathematics, and religion. The fact that evil,\nrelative to a leafy body, is more difficult to define, harder to measure, and impossible to experiment upon\n— at least ethically — doesn’t mean we should take it off the table of scientific inquiry. What it means is\nthat we must be clear about what we can understand, and how we can distinguish between the various\n\ninterpretations on offer. When we explore the evolution of evil, what are we measuring and what evidence\n\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 22\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012768",
