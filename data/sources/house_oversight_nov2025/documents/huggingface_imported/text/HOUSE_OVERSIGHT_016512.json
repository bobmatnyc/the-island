Much of this enforcement redundancy, as considered in\ndetail below, has been a deliberate federal response to diverse problems of underenforcement in state criminal justice. The\npoint for now, however, is the functional equivalence of duplicative federal-state jurisdiction, nation-state jurisdiction, and\nagency jurisdiction. All represent a common strategy to reduce underenforcement by empowering redundant enforcement\nauthorities: independent entities with equivalent institutional capacity and expertise share jurisdiction. If one neglects to\nenforce, the other may. Functionally, each backstops, or provides oversight of, failures to enforce by the other.\n\nA second model for minimizing unjustified failures to prosecute relies on private actors to create redundancy with public\nprosecutors’ authority. Empowering private actors to file and litigate public law claims is familiar in many civil law contexts;\nnumerous federal statutes authorize private rights of action that enable private individuals or groups to supplement public\nagencies’ law enforcement efforts. '*° Through much of the nineteenth century, this kind of duplicative public-private\nenforcement authority was a familiar feature in the criminal justice systems of many states, which permitted private parties -\nvictims - to prosecute alleged criminal wrongdoing.\n\nRedundant charging authority takes other forms as well. In large hierarchical agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice,\ninternal administrative review of front-line prosecutors’ charging or declination decisions by higher-ups creates a version of\nredundant enforcement authority; supervisors can make independent determinations and reverse front-line prosecutors. 1°\n[*848] This kind of redundancy through administrative review now exists in English, Irish, and many European criminal\njustice systems. !7\nMore ambitiously from a U.S. perspective - because it is rare here - judicial power to review prosecutorial charging decisions is\nanother means to create some degree of redundant charging authority between the executive and judicial branches. Although\ncriminal charging is a core function of the executive branch, state and federal courts have modest authority to review and bar\nexecutive officials’ decisions to file criminal charges. It is only as a matter of policy that courts - with a few exceptions - are not\nempowered to address underenforcement by reviewing the executive's noncharging decisions. (This power is somewhat broader\nfor courts in England and Wales as well as in the law of a few states.) !% This model of redundancy separates charging\nauthority - for courts as for Department of Justice supervisors, the power to order prosecutors to prosecute - from enforcement\nauthority, which includes the institutional capacity to file and litigate charges. Courts (with rare exceptions) have no\nadministrative capacity to litigate a prosecution; but they could provide some redundancy in charging authority. !?\n\nIn sum, charging redundancy can occur between equivalent agencies in separate governments, between public and private\nactors, or between agencies or branches of the same government. Criminal justice systems in Europe and the common law\nworld have adopted or strengthened one or more of these mechanisms in recent decades. In the United States, choices among\nthese strategies have changed over time and between jurisdictions. Nearly all states that once authorized private prosecution\nhave long since prohibited it. Federal prosecutors are organized in a centralized hierarchical agency that makes administrative\nreview possible, but few state prosecutors are similarly organized. For these reasons and others, the primary means of\nenforcement redundancy to combat underenforcement is overlapping federal- [*849] state authority made possible by the\ndistinctive U.S. model of federalism.\n\n‘5 Examples of federal statutes authorizing private rights of action include the Clayton Act, 75 U.S.C. § 15 (2006) (granting a private right of\naction for antitrust violations); Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h) (1994); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 ULS.C. §\n2000e-5(f) (1994); Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12/33 (1994). For an overview, see Pamela H. Bucy, Private Justice, 76 S.\nCal. L. Rev. 1, 12-54 (2002).\n\n16 See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(f) (2012) (mandating review of federal prosecutor decisions within the Justice Department upon victim's request).\n7 See infra Part IT.A.1.\n18 See infra Parts II.B.3-B.4.\n\n19 Note that this conception of redundant authority intersects with, but is distinct from, constitutional separation of powers. In a standard\naccount (briefly put), separation of powers describes branches of government having distinct roles, authority, and competencies. In the main,\nbranches do not do the same things; they do different, rival, and complementary things. But if so empowered by the legislature, courts can\nexercise some degree of charging authority, creating limited redundancy in charging authority between the executive and judicial branches.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016512",
