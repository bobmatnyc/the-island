  "text": "final round of discussion, while on board, the president, almost ceremonially, ordered the\nstrike for the next day.\n\nWith the meeting over and the decision made, Trump, in a buoyant mood, came back to\nchat with reporters traveling with him on Air Force One. In a teasing fashion, he declined\nto say what he planned to do about Syria. An hour later, Air Force One landed and the\npresident was hustled to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe Chinese president and his wife arrived for dinner shortly after five o’clock and\nwere greeted by a military guard on the Mar-a-Lago driveway. With Ivanka supervising\narrangements, virtually the entire White House senior staff attended.\n\nDuring a dinner of Dover sole, haricots verts, and thumbelina carrots—Kushner seated\nwith the Chinese first couple, Bannon at the end of the table—the attack on Al Shayrat\nairfield was launched.\n\nShortly before ten, the president, reading straight off the teleprompter, announced that\nthe mission had been completed. Dina Powell arranged a for-posterity photo of the\npresident with his advisers and national security team in the makeshift situation room at\nMar-a-Lago. She was the only woman in the room. Steve Bannon glowered from his seat\nat the table, revolted by the stagecraft and the “phoniness of the fucking thing.”\n\nIt was a cheerful and relieved Trump who mingled with his guests among the palm\ntrees and mangroves. “That was a big one,” he confided to a friend. His national security\nstaff were even more relieved. The unpredictable president seemed almost predictable.\nThe unmanageable president, manageable.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020029",
