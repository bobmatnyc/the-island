  "text": "6.1.13 The Company may not engage in certain businesses\n\nOn February 24, 1998, without admitting or denying liability, Michael R. Milken consented to the entry of a\nfinal judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in Securities and Exchange\nCommission v. Michael R. Milken et al., which judgment was entered on February 26, 1998 restraining\nand enjoining Michael Milken from associating with any broker, dealer, investment advisor, investment\ncompany or municipal securities dealer, and from violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act\"). On March 711, 1991, in the action entitled In the Matter of\nMichael R. Milken, the SEC instituted a proceeding pursuant to Section 15(b}(6) of the Exchange Act and\nordered that Michael Milken be barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment advisor,\ninvestment company or municipal securities dealer. On April 24, 1990, concurrently with a plea agreement\ncovering criminal violations of federal securities laws, Michael Milken also consented, without admitting or\ndenying liability, to the entry of a final judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Drexel Burnham Lambert\nIncorporated, et al., restraining and enjoining Michael Milken from engaging in transactions, acts,\npractices and courses of business which constitute or would constitute viclations of, or which aid and abet\nor would aid and abet violations of, Sections 7(c), 7{f), 9(a)(2), 10(b), 13(d), 14(e}, 15(¢}(3) and 17(a)(1) of\nthe Exchange Act, and Regulations T and X and Rules 10b-5, 10b-6, 13d-1, 13d-2, 148-3, 15c3-1, 17a-3\nand 17a-4 promulgated thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.\n\nThe Company cannot be in the business of or associated with a broker, dealer, investment company,\ninvestment advisor, or municipal securities dealer (collectively, “prohibited businesses’). As a result, the\nCompany cannot pursue any acquisitions or investments that may have the effect of the Company being\nin any prohibited business. This could adversely affect the Company's ability to make and/or hold\ninvestments or acquisitions which may otherwise be consistent with its business objectives.\n\n6.1.14 Litigation and adverse publicity concerning alleged incidents at KLC or other\n‘child care centers could hurt KLC's reputation\n\nKLC is subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims and\nlitigation involving allegations of physical or sexual abuse of children. Any such allegations, claims or\nlawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on KLC OpCo's\nfinancial position, operating results or cash flows.\n\nPersonal trust and parent referrals play a key role in the child care business. KLC believes its success is\ndirectly related to its reputation and favorable brand identity. KLC is periodically subject to claims and\nlitigation alleging negligence, inadequate supervision and other grounds for liability arising from injuries or\nother harm to children. in addition, claimants may seek damages from KLC for child abuse, sexual abuse\nor other criminal acts arising out of alleged incidents at KLC's centers. There are lengthy statute of\nlimitations periods applicable to child abuse and personal injury claims. Such claims may typically be\nbrought until a number of years after a claimant reaches the age of majority. Any adverse publicity\nconcerning such incidents at one of KLC's child care centers, or child care centers generally, could greatly\ndamage KLC's reputation and could have an adverse effect on occupancy levels at KLC's centers.\n\n6.1.15 KLC's insurance policies may be inadequate to cover claims, and KLC may be\nunable to maintain existing coverage in the future at reasonable prices\n\nSome operators of child care centers have experienced difficulty obtaining general liability insurance or\nother liability insurance that covers child abuse. KLC maintains insurance policies to protect against\nrelevant liability exposures in amounts KLC considers to be appropriate. In addition, KLC’s owned\ncenters are covered by blanket insurance policies, including property insurance. Although KLC has not\nhistorically had to pay any claims exceeding its coverage, claims in excess of, or not included within, its\ncoverage may be asserted. To the extent that any claims are not covered by insurance, KLC will be\nforced to cover the associated costs itself, which will reduce the amount of cash KLC has available for\nother business purposes.\n\n50\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024483",
