  "text": "I have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, the\nlanguage of “feeling s” had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of “action;” we\nwould do terrible acts that would cause bad feelings in the enemy which would then serve to justify\nwhatever response it made. It had always been a question of the harsh insensitive acts Westerners do against\nMuslims and the resulting hurt, loss, shame etc. that Muslims experience. The Ground Zero Mosque\nincident, however, broke new ground because all of a sudden non-Muslims’ feelings became the focus and\nwere cast as resulting from Muslim acts. Another example was seen in how quickly the attempt to blame the\nBenghazi murders on the video about Mohammad fell apart. Just as large corporations eventually learned to\nturn away from shakedown attempts from race baiters, we are beginning to learn to demand symmetry\nthrough mirroring. A word of caution: When enablers change their behavior and demand symmetrical rules\nf or the addict, the latter typically initially erupts with great resistance. This is a stage we must be prepared\nto tolerate and fully withstand as it creates the only real chance for the addict to finally change. It is critical,\ntherefore, that when we finally engage in mirroring that we be prepared to see it through completion.\n\nFP: What if we fail to engage in our own Inner Jihad and the Control Factor stays firmly in place?\n\nSiegel: Critical to the Inner Jihad is the realization that our civilization is fragile; not to be taken for granted.\nOur demands for multi-culturalism and diversity have bumped heads with the simple paradox that tolerating\nthe intolerant leads to extinction. Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the most crystalline version of\nasymmetry we have accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST place the Koran above all law while in\nAmerica, the Constitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad , founder of CAIR, reputedly said, “Islam isn’t\nin Amer ica to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in\nAmerica and Islam is the only accepted religion on Earth.” Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the\nControl Factor constantly seeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be\nnegotiated. Only one can survive not because we have declared “war” but because our Islamic Enemy has.\nThat is, perhaps, the lesson we will most need to fully learn, one way or another. We will eventually hit a\nTurnaround Moment as a nation and if enough of us are not truly prepared to fight and continue to be\ncontrolled by our delusions, we will lose. If we truly seek to win, it is better to get there sooner while we\nhave advantages than later.\n\nFP: Bill Siegel, thank you for joining FrontPage Interview.\nAnd thank you for writing this superb and most important book.\n\nWe encourage all o f our readers to get their hands on The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True\nThreat and to read it!\n\nEditor’s note: To watch The Glazov Gang‘s recent discussion about the Muslim Brotherhood’s\ninfiltration of the United States and the Obama administration, see this week’s episode below:\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nFiled Under: Daily Mailer, FrontPage Tagged With: Denial, Islam, muslim brotherhood, Obama, Siegel,\nThe Control Factor\n\n22\n\n= Print This Post\nAbout Jamie Glazov\n\nJamie Glazov is Frontpage Magazine's editor.
