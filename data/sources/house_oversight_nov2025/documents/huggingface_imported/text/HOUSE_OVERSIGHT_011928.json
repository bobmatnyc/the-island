  "text": "article quoted a deposition by then-Palm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter, in which he\nstated that Epstein, a billionaire with many powerful friends, had received special treatment in\nboth his plea deal and the terms of his incarceration. Although federal investigators at one point\nproduced a draft 53-page indictment against Epstein, he was eventually allowed to plead guilty\nto only two relatively minor state charges and receive a short term of incarceration: 13 months in\nthe county jail, during which he went to the office every day, and one year of community control,\nduring which he traveled frequently to New York and his private island in the Virgin Islands.\n\nThe Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which Epstein apparently received\nspecial consideration: As a convicted sex offender, he is required by law to undergo an impartial\npsychological evaluation prior to sentencing and to receive psychiatric treatment during and after\nincarceration. This is because child molesters tend to be repeat offenders with high rates of\nrecidivism. According to a source in law enforcement, however, Epstein was allowed to submit a\nreport by his private psychologist, Dr. Stephen Alexander of Palm Beach, Florida, whose phone\nhas since been disconnected with no forwarding information.\n\nThe Daily Beast’s second article provided details about Epstein’s systematic abuse of underage\ngirls at his Palm Beach mansion, where members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a\nparade of teenagers, most of them 16 or younger, to perform daily massages that devolved into\nmasturbation, groping, and sometimes full-blown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary\nrelationship between Epstein and Jean Luc Brunel, a frequent visitor to whom he gave $1 million\naround the same time that Brunel was starting his MC2 modeling agency. Some of the young\ngirls MC2 recruited from overseas—often from Eastern Europe and South America—are known\nto have been passengers on Epstein’s private jets.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney General’s Office in Florida says that it is against policy to confirm or deny the\nexistence of an investigation. Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyer, Jack Goldberger, says he has no\nknowledge of an ongoing probe, and he told The Daily Beast, \"Jeffrey Epstein has fully\ncomplied with all state and federal requirements that arise from the prior proceedings in Palm\nBeach. There are no pending civil lawsuits. There are not and should not be any pending criminal\ninvestigations, given Mr. Epstein’s complete fulfillment of all the terms of his non-prosecution\nagreement with the federal government.\"\n\nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500\ncompanies and has produced three current-events debate TV programs, The Americas Forum,\nFrom Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report . She is writing a book about\nchild trafficking in America\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011928",
