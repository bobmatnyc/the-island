  "text": "After the premiere, Frida Giannini, creative director of Gucci, and Harvey Weinstein host a slightly\ndecadent, secret, after-party on the outside terrace at the Bauer Palazzo. The 53-year old Material Girl\nbrings Brahim Zaibat—her 24-year old break-dancing boyfriend—sips bellinis and sings \"Like a Virgin\"\nuntil 4:30 a.m. to Valentino and Guy Oseary and her cast: Andrea Riseborough, Abbie Cornish, James\nD'arcy and Oscar Issac, who is also in the Cannes-winner Drive.\n\nSimultaneously, Sony Picture Classic's Michael Barker and Tom Bernard premiere Roman Polanski’s\nCarnage, based on Yasmina Reza's French play God of Carnage, which played to packed houses in Paris,\nLondon, New York and Los Angeles.\n\nCurvaceous Kate Winslet, appearing in three films at the festival (Carnage, Mildred Pierce and\nContagion), makes her red carpet debut—whipping out her mobile phone and photographing the fans.\nFresh from fighting fires and saving lives on Richard Branson's Necker Island, she is joined by bearded co-\nstars Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly.\n\nPolanski is in Gstaad. He remains a wanted man in the U.S., and although he avoided an extradition\ncharge last year, he still risks arrest in some parts of Europe. Carnage, filmed in “real time” is a 79-\nminute actor's showcase set in one room in a Brooklyn apartment shot entirely in Paris.\n\nMid September, two years after Polanski was arrested en route to the very same Zurich Film Festival, he\nwill return to receive a lifetime achievement award.\n\nAt the Carnage dinner Kate talks about portraying a neurotic wife and mother who gets drunk at a\ncivilized sit-down and projectile vomits between two couples discussing their sons schoolyard fight. Kate\ntells me the vomit was actually squashed banana, oatmeal and molasses that Roman would lick between\ntakes for comic relief.\n\nMildred Pierce's HBO gang, including Kary Antholis, director Todd Haynes and co-stars Guy Pearce and\nEvan Rachel Wood are at Kate's table digesting this information.\n\nKate and Guy later win Emmy’s.\nFriday, Sept. 2, 2011\n\nToday is the day Cipriani's is over-booked and they are hell bent on tossing me into the canal. No queen-\nsize bed, nor cot, nor couch materializes. Peter Brant is renting half of the Bauer Palladio next door\nbecause even he could not get into my oasis with all of his kids. The bed Peter promised me for tonight\nhas been quietly given away to Owen Wilson, who surprisingly arrives on Larry Gagosian's plane this\nmorning. Peter heroically rescues me by finding a suite in his hotel with double-the-height ceilings for a\ngazillion Euros.\n\nWith the noon toss-out and luggage left in Cipriani's lobby, | race to the press screening of Sony Pictures\nClassics and Canadian David Cronenberg's highly anticipated A Dangerous Method, produced by Jeremy\nThomas.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012742",
