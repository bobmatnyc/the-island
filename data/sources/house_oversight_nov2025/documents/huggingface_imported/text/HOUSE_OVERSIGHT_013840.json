  "text": "of course, is to do so while maintaining or increasing your income.\n\nThe intention of this chapter, and what you will experience if you follow the instructions, is an\nincrease in personal productivity between 100 and 500%. The principles are the same for both employees\nand entrepreneurs, but the purpose of this increased productivity is completely different.\n\nFirst, the employee. The employee is increasing productivity to increase negotiating leverage for two\nsimultaneous objectives: pay raises and a remote working arrangement.\n\nRecall that, as indicated in the first chapter of this book, the general process of joining the New Rich is\nD-E-A-L, in that order, but that employees intent on remaining employees for now need to implement\nthe process as D-E-L-A. The reason relates to environment. They need to Liberate themselves from the\noffice environment before they can work ten hours a week, for example, because the expectation in that\nenvironment is that you will be in constant motion from 9-5. Even if you produce twice the results you\nhad in the past, if you’re working a quarter of the hours of your colleagues, there is a good chance of\nreceiving a pink slip. Even if you work 10 hours a week and produce twice the results of people working\n40, the collective request will be, “Work 40 hours a week and produce 8 times the results.” This is an\nendless game and one you want to avoid. Hence the need for Liberation first.\n\nIf you’re an employee, this chapter will increase your value and make it more painful for the company\nto fire you than to grant raises and a remote working agreement. That is your goal. Once the latter is\naccomplished, you can drop hours without bureaucratic interference and use the resultant free time to\nfulfill dreamlines.\n\nThe entrepreneur’s goals are less complex, as he or she is generally the direct beneficiary of increased\nprofit. The goal is to decrease the amount of work you perform while increasing revenue. This will set\nthe stage for replacing yourself with Automation, which in turn permits Liberation.\n\nFor both tracks, some definitions are in order.\n\nBeing Effective vs. Being Efficient\n\nEo ttcctivencss is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given\ntask (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard\nto effectiveness is the default mode of the universe.\n\nI would consider the best door-to-door salesperson efficient—that is, refined and excellent at selling\ndoor-to-door without wasting time—but utterly ineffective. He or she would sell more using a better\nvehicle such as e-mail or direct mail.\n\nThis is also true for the person who checks e-mail 30 times per day and develops an elaborate system\nof folder rules and sophisticated techniques for ensuring that each of those 30 brain farts moves as\nquickly as possible. I was a specialist at such professional wheel-spinning. It is efficient on some\nperverse level, but far from effective.\n\nHere are two truisms to keep in mind:\n\n1. Doing something unimportant well does not make it important.\n\n2. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.\n\nFrom this moment forward, remember this: What you do is infinitely more important than how you do\nit. Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right things.\n\nTo find the right things, we’ll need to go to the garden.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013840",
