This price insensitivity is exacerbated because the\n\nconsumer, in effect, gets it at a discounted price anyway.\nKP Source: 1) Accounting for the cost of US healthcare, McKinsey Global institute\nwww.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 301\n\nRestructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors—\n\nConsumers Increasingly Demand Expensive Treatment and Are Able to\nPay for it With Government Subsidies\n\nTotal High-End Surgeries up 50x from 1970-2004, Driven by Medical\nAdvancements + Consumer Ability to Spend Assisted by Government Payments\n\n# of Patients (Aged 50+) Undergoing Typical Costs per\n\nAdvanced Procedures in USA Procedure ($)\n1970 2004\nCoronary Procedures\nice tla <20,000 1.1 million $12,000\nImplantation\nPacemaker / ICD‘ <10,000 350,000 $15-34,000\nBypass <10,000 220,000 $28,000\nDialysis Procedures <10,000 480,000 ee nal\nJoint Replacement Procedures\nHip <20,000 390,000 $12,500\nKnee on 440,000 $12,500\nNote: 1) ICD is Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator, which is similar to a pacemaker but for a heart rhythm that beats too fast.\nCost of procedure approximated by Medicare reimbursement.\n(@E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 302\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020992",
