  "text": "CHAPTER Ill Cannabis Industry Segmentation\n\nCannabis Software Platforms\n\nBusiness Services\n\nThe business services market includes (i) operational consulting, including facility planning, con-\nstruction and security; (ii) financial services, including accounting and payment-processing services;\n(iii) legal, compliance and other professional advisory services; (iv) temporary and full-time staffing\nservices; (v) real estate services; and (vi) industry events and conferences. These services are typically\nprovided by professional services firms; some of these firms focus solely on the cannabis industry while\nothers serve a broad range of industries.\n\nBusiness Solutions Opportunities\nWe believe opportunities in this segment include:\n\nIndustry-specific Solutions. As the cannabis industry emerges, there will be a significant market\nopportunity for providers of solutions tailored for the industry. Point-solution providers may be acqui-\nsition targets if larger companies enter the market in the future.\n\nIntegrated Platforms. We believe that integrated “seed-to-sale” solutions will be ideally positioned.\n\n“Big Data” Analytics. We believe that there is an attractive opportunity to develop and license\nindustry datasets. Such datasets should provide strategic advantages to organizations that establish\nsubstantial reach early and may also be licensed more broadly to enhance targeting, services, cross-sales\nand product development.\n\nBusiness Solutions Challenges\nChallenges in this segment include:\n\nDevelopment and Deployment Risk. Due to the time and investment required to develop software\nproducts and the emerging nature of the cannabis industry, there is a risk that developed applications\nmay not be effective or widely adopted. In addition, certain segments of the cannabis industry are more\nmature than others; this disparity may present challenges in developing solutions that support cohesive\nand scalable business models.\n\nLow Barriers to Entry. Numerous sectors of the business services market are becoming increasingly\ncrowded.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 57\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024693",
