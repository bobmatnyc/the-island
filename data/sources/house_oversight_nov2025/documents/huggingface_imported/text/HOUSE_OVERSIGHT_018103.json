There is general\nagreement in the United States on two points. First, an Iranian\nnuclear weapons capability is “unacceptable’’, as both the Bush and\nObama Administrations have put it; and second, we prefer getting to\nan acceptable outcome without using force. The debate gets testy\nwhen we consider that means short of force, such as sanctions and\ncovert technical sabotage, might not work.\n\nIt may be too simple to reduce the argument to just two sides—those\nwho fear the regime’s acquisition of nuclear weapons more than the\nconsequences of a war to prevent it, and those who fear the\nconsequences of a war above all else—but in this case simplicity has\nthe virtue of capturing the essence as observers ponder which set of\nunpalatable risks they would rather run. What is remarkable, though\nhardly surprising, is that the two sides usually put forth very different\nassessments of what using force would entail. Those who fear Iranian\nnukes above all else tend to minimize the risks of using force, while\nthose who fear war tend to exaggerate them. Neither side, however,\nhas persuasively spelled out the reasons for their assessment, leading\none to suspect that much of the argument rests on less than rigorous\nanalysis.\n\nWhat would an honest assessment of the risks of military conflict\nwith Iran look like?
