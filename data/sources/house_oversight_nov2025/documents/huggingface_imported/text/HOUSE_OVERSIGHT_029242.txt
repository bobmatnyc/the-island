That's ideal. Larry's away and I'll be working all day. I'm free any time.

Dear Jeffrey,

May | drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on the 17th or 18th?) to get your advice
about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in the coming year for Poetry in
America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the bottom a
message just for you....

-Lisa

That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and informal,
online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to

begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work.

Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker’s Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal
sponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an
elusive friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or
provided overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you
highlighted our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors;
whether you flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked
your children’s school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take an
interest in the project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of
distribution; whether you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we
have done.
