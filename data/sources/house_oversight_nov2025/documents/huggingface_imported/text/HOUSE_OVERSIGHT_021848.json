That is the basis for that particular\nallegation.\n\nQ. Mr. Cassell, does the police report you're\nreferring to at any point say Professor Dershowitz\nabused any of these particular minors -- not were they\nabused at the mansion -- but did it say anywhere that\nProfessor Dershowitz did that?\n\nA. The police report itself does not refer to\nProfessor Dershowitz abusing these girls. However, when\nyou look at the police report, what it shows is a\npattern of egregious sexual abuse of approximately 23 to\n24 young girls over an extended period of time at a\nmansion that was owned by Jeffrey Epstein who was one of\nthe closest personal friends, from what I could gather,\nof Mr. Dershowitz.\n\nAnd so that was -- there's other information.\nI don't want to filibuster you on that. I would be\nhappy to elaborate on that, but that is the first piece\nof evidence that I would begin referring to. If you\nwant a more -- if you want -- just so the record is\nclear, if you want to know all the bases, all the\ngrounds for which that allegation appears, then I would\n\nlike to make a more extended presentation.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021848",
