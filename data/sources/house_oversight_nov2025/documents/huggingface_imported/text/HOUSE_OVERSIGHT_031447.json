WEINBERG, P.C.\nATTORNEY AT LAW\n\n20 PARK PLAZA, SUITE 1000 EMAIL ADDRESSES;\n\nBOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 02116\n\na\nnx\nNIGHT EMERGENCY\n\nAugust 19, 2015\n\nVia Certified Mail\n\nMelanie Ann Pustay\n\nDirector of Office of Information Policy\n\nSean R. O’Neill\n\nChief, Administrative Appeals Staff\n\nOffice of Information Policy\n\nUnited States Department of Justice, Suite 11050\n1425 New York Avenue, N.W.\n\nWashington, D.C. 20530\n\nRE: FBI Request No 1203982-001/ DOJ OIP Appeal AP-2013-01397 (Jeffrey\nEpstein)\n\nDear Ms. Pustay and Mr. O’Neill:\n\nOn March 29, 2013, the OIP determined that the FBI could not rely on 5 U.S.C. §\n552(b)(7)(A) as a basis to withhold all records of past investigations regarding Mr. Epstein’s\nprior FBI FOIA request. On April 25, 2013, the FBI reopened the above-numbered FOIA\nrequest and stated that it had started its processing and searching for responsive records. On\nJune 24, 2013, the FBI was informed that Mr. Epstein would pay the costs of copying. At\npresent, 27 ‘2 months after the FBI started to process Mr. Epstein’s FOJA request, Mr. Epstein\nhas received just two “batches,” the first numbering 372 pages (including redactions) that was\nproduced on December 16, 2014, and the second “batch” numbering 336 pages that was\nproduced 5 4 months later on May 29, 2015, out ofa file that exceeds 12,000 pages. The\nprocessing of a third “batch” of documents will not begin until, at earliest, October, 2015, see\ninfra. At this pace, the FBI will not complete the processing Mr. Epstein’s file until 2025. A\ncitizen should not have to wait over a decade for an agency to meet its FOIA obligations. As\ndocumented below — and within the May 1, 2015, and August 13, 2015, letters to Mr. Dennis\nArgall, FBI FOIPA Public Liaison Officer, each of which are attached — the FBI has declined to\nmeet its statutory obligations in providing Freedom of Information Act mandated disclosures\nrelating to the above-numbered request without unreasonable delay. Accordingly, I appeal to the\nOIP to require the FBI to comply with its March 29, 2013, determination in a reasonably prompt\nmanner.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031447",
