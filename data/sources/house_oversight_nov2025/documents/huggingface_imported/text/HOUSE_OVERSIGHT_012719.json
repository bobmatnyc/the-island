  "text": "June 8, 2011\n\nspecifically, how do we get businesses\nto do more in terms of hiring, spend\nless on redtape, less on bureaucracy,\nand reduce the regulatory burden in\nsmart ways?\n\nThe current administration has said\nsome of the right things but actually\nmoved in the wrong direction. We have\nseen a sharp increase in the last couple\nof years in what are deemed to be\nmajor economically significant rules.\nThat is defined as regulations that im-\npose a cost on the economy of $100 mil-\nlion or more.\n\nAccording to the administration’s Of-\nfice of Management and Budget, the\ncurrent administration has been regu-\nlating at a pace of 84 major rules per\nyear. By way of comparison, that is\nabout a 50-percent increase over the\nregulatory output during the Clinton\nadministration, which had about 56\nrules per year, and an increase from\nthe Bush administration as well. So we\nhave seen more regulations and more\nsignificant regulations.\n\nI was encouraged to hear President\nObama’s words when he talked about\nthe Executive order in January, which\nis entitled ‘‘Improving Regulation and\nRegulatory Review.’”’ But now we need\nto see action. We need to see it from\nthe administration, from individual\nagencies to provide real regulatory re-\nlief for job creators to be able to reduce\nthis drag on the economy.\n\nOne commonsense step we can take is\nto strengthen what is called the Un-\nfunded Mandates Relief Act. It was\npassed in 1995. It was bipartisan. I was\na cosponsor in the House of Represent-\natives. It is an effort to require Federal\nregulators to evaluate the cost of rules,\nto look at the benefits and the costs,\nand to look at less costly alternatives\non rules.\n\nThe two amendments I would like to\noffer over the next few days as we con-\nsider the legislation before us would\nimprove this Unfunded Mandates Re-\nform Act, and it would reform it in\nways that are entirely consistent with\nthe principle President Obama has laid\nout and committed to in his Executive\norder on regulatory review.\n\nThe first amendment would require\nagencies specifically to assess poten-\ntial effects of new regulations on job\ncreation—so focusing in on jobs—and\nto consider market-based and non-\ngovernmental alternatives to regula-\ntion. This would broaden the scope of\nthe Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to\nrequire cost-benefit analysis of rules\nthat impose direct or indirect costs of\n$100 million a year or more. So, again,\nthis is for major rules of $100 million or\nmore. It would also require agencies to\nadopt the least costly or least burden-\nsome option that achieves whatever\npolicy goals have been set out by Con-\ngress. It seems to me it is a common-\nsense amendment. I hope we will get\nbipartisan support for it.\n\nThe second amendment would extend\nthe Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to\nso-called independent agencies which\ntoday are actually exempt from the\n\ncost-benefit rules that govern all other\nagencies. In 1995, we had this debate\nand determined at that time we would\nnot extend the legislation to inde-\npendent agencies. In the interim, inde-\npendent agencies have been providing\nmore and more rules, have put out\nmore and more regulations, and are\nhaving a bigger and bigger impact. An\nexample of an independent agency\nwould be the SEC, the Securities and\nExchange Commission, or the CFTC,\nwhich is the Commodity Futures Trad-\ning Commission. These are agencies\nthat, although independent in the exec-\nutive branch, are very much involved\nin putting out major rules and regula-\ntions. It is sometimes called the ‘‘head-\nless fourth branch’’ of government be-\ncause their rules are not reviewed for\ncost-benefit analysis, even by the OMB,\nthe Office of Management and Budget,\nin its Office of Information and Regu-\nlatory Affairs, so-called OIRA.\n\nWe have looked at some GAO data\nand put together various studies, and it\nappears to us that there are about 200\nregulations that were issued between\n1996 until today that would be deemed\nto have an impact of $100 million or\nmore on the economy but were auto-\nmatically excluded from the Unfunded\nMandates Relief Act because they were\ndeemed to be from independent agen-\ncies.\n\nSo it is basically closing a loophole\nand closing this independent agency\nloophole, which I believe is a sensible\nreform. It has been endorsed by many\npeople, including, interestingly, the\ncurrent OIRA Administrator and the\nPresident’s regulatory czar, Cass\nSunstein, who, in a 2002 Law Review ar-\nticle, talked about the fact that this is\nan area where UMRA ought to be ex-\ntended because, again, there were so\nmany independent agencies that were\nputting out regulations impacting job\ncreation in this country.\n\nNo regulation, whatever its source,\nshould be imposed on American em-\nployers or on State and local govern-\nments without serious consideration of\nthe costs, the benefits, and the avail-\nability of a least-burdensome alter-\nnative. Both these amendments would\nmove us further toward that sensible\ngoal, and I hope the leadership will\nallow these amendments to be offered.\nI think they fit well with the under-\nlying legislation. If they are offered, I\ncertainly urge my colleagues on both\nsides of the aisle to support them.\n\nI yield the floor. I suggest the ab-\nsence of a quorum.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The\nclerk will call.\n\nThe bill clerk proceeded to call the\nroll.\n\nMr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask\nunanimous consent that the order for\nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without\nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\nEe\n\nMORNING BUSINESS\n\nMr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask\nunanimous consent that Senators be\n\nGase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 85-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2011 Page 2 of 4\n: CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE\n\nS3607\n\nallowed to speak as in morning busi-\nness for up to 10 minutes each.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without\nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\nEE\n\nTRIBUTE TO LOUIS E. GIVAN\n\nMr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I\nrise today to recognize a distinguished\nKentuckian who has worked tirelessly\non behalf of our Nation’s soldiers, sail-\nors and marines for more than 40 years.\nLouis E. Givan, a lifelong resident of\nmy hometown of Louisville, has played\na vital role in protecting the men and\nwomen of our Armed Forces and our\ncountry’s defense.\n\nFormerly a sailor himself in the U.S.\nNavy, he has served for the last 11\nyears as the general manager of\nRaytheon Missile Systems operations\nin Louisville. I was saddened to hear of\nhis retirement from that position this\ncoming July 5. He will certainly be\nmissed.\n\nMr. Givan—or, to those who know\nhim, Ed—was a 1966 graduate of St. Xa-\nvier High School in Louisville and in\n1970 earned his bachelor of science de-\ngree in mechanical engineering from\nthe J.B. Speed School of Engineering\nat the University of Louisville. In 1968,\nhe began working at the Naval Ord-\nnance Station in Louisville, and he\nstayed at that post until 1996, in var-\nious engineering and supervisory posi-\ntions.\n\nIn 1996 the Naval Ordnance Station\ntransitioned to private ownership, and\nEd's leadership was crucial in making\nthat transition a successful one. The\nfacility eventually became part of\nRaytheon Missile Systems, and Ed was\nappointed general manager in 2000. As\ngeneral manager, Ed has led Raytheon\nMissile Systems in Louisville to great\nsuccess, success for both the company\nand for the local community. They de-\nsign, develop, and produce vital weap-\nons systems for our armed forces, ena-\nbling America to have the most formi-\ndable military force in the world.\nWeapons produced at the Louisville fa-\ncility are used by our forces in all parts\nof the globe, including in Iraq.\n\nKentucky is lucky to have benefitted\nfrom Ed’s dedication, commitment to\nexcellence, and leadership for so many\nyears. I am sure his wife Velma; his\nsons Eddie, Tony, and Chris; and his\ngrandchildren Benjamin, Nathan,\nIsaac, Macy and Natalie are all very\nproud of what Ed has accomplished. I\nwish him the very best in retirement,\nand I am sure my colleagues join me in\nsaying that this U.S. Senate thanks\nMr. Louis E. ‘‘Ed’’ Givan for his faith-\nful service.\n\nCRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS ACT\n\nMr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unani-\nmous consent that the following letter\nbe printed in the RECORD.\n\nThere being no objection, the mate-\nrial was ordered to be printed in the\nRECORD, as follows:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012719",
