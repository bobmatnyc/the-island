  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nThe second problem is that current law makes it nearly impossible to reopen a closed case on a\nsecond or third writ of habeus corpus. The “great writ” has been severely restricted by Congress,\nand even compelling evidence of innocence does not guarantee a new trial. In fact, when I argued\nan appeal from the denial of a second petition for habeus corpus—my only courtroom\ninvolvement to date in this long case—one of the judges warned me not to bring any further\npetitions. I told him I would be obliged to bring a further petition, if the evidence warranted it.\n\nSuch new evidence has now been found, and the Court of Appeals recently ordered the district\ncourt to consider all the new “evidence as a whole.” So the case is far from over. I continue to\nconfer on the case with Harvey Silverglate, who was MacDonald’s classmate at Princeton and\nwho was my co-counsel in the earlier Habeus Corpus appeal.\n\nWhatever happens, I believe that Jeffrey MacDonald has not yet received a fair trial. I believe he\ndeserves one - - and the American people deserve to know the full story, not the abbreviated one\npresented at the trial or the biased on presented in the book and TV movie.
