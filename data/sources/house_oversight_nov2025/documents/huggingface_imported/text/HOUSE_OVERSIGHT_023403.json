  "text": "In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)\n\nin part due to the failure of States to achieve anything like consensus on the definition of terrorism.” Jd. at 97. But it did so\nlargely because there has been some disagreement among States on how to distinguish “terrorists” from “freedom fighters,”\nand because the district court had rested its holding on the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United\nStates instead of primary sources of international law. Jd. at 98-103, 107-08. Those concerns are not present here.\n\nAny disagreement about how to characterize attacks by domestic attacks within a country by national liberation movements\nis inapplicable to al-Qaeda’s international terrorist attacks on innocent civilians in the United States. See Almog, 471 F. Supp.\n2d at 281; Bahlul, 2011 U.S. CMCR LEXIS 3 at *128. And the primary sources of international law discussed above reveal a\ncustomary norm of international law that directly covers the acts of international terrorism alleged in these cases --\ntransnational attacks, *134 and the provision of material support for such attacks, on innocent civilians intended to influence\nthe conduct of a government or population by intimidation or coercion. That norm is no “less definite [in] content ... than the\nhistorical paradigms familiar when [the ATS] was enacted.” Sosa, 532 U.S. at 732; cf Abdullahi, 562 F.3d at 184 (although\nthere are varying definitions of piracy, it is actionable under the ATS because “ ‘whatever may be the diversity by\ndefinitions,’ ” there was a consensus “ ‘that robbery or forcible depredations upon the sea ... is piracy’ ”) (quoting United\nStates v. Smith, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat) 153, 159-61 (1820)).\n\nFinally, international terrorism is clearly “capable of impairing international peace and security,” Mores, 414 F.3d at 249, a\nfactor this court has found to be “important” in demonstrating that the international law norm is of “ ‘mutual’ concern to\nStates,” and thus actionable under the ATS, Abdullahi, 562 F.3d at 185. The U.N. Security Council Resolutions specifically\nstate as much, see supra at Point n.b.2, and the United States invaded Afghanistan because the Taliban regime had supported\nal-Qaeda prior to the September 11th Attacks. See Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 567-68 (2006) (discussing\nAuthorization for Use of Military Force, 115 Stat. 224 (2001)).\n\n*135 For these reasons, there is a customary international norm against the commission of and provision of material support\nfor acts of international terrorism that is sufficiently universal, obligatory, definite, and of mutual concern to States to give\nrise to a claim under the ATS. Thus, plaintiffs’ allegations that defendants purposefully provided financing and other forms\nof material support to al-Qaeda to further its terrorist mission to attack the United States and its nationals state a claim under\nthe ATS, without regard to whether they also state a claim for aiding and abetting the September 11th Attacks. The district\ncourt therefore erred as a matter of law in dismissing the ATS claims on the ground that they failed to allege that defendants\n“ourposefully aided and abetted, conspired with, or materially supported al Qaida mm the commission of an act of terrorism\ninvolving the hijacking of a commercial airplane.” SPA233 (Terrorist Attacks V) (emphasis added).\n\nIU. The District Court Improperly Dismissed the Torture Victim Protection Act Claims\n\nPlaintiffs also brought claims under the Torture Victim Protection Act (““TVPA”), which provides a cause of action for\nvictims of torture or extrajudicial killings perpetrated by “individual[s]” acting “under actual or apparent authority, or color\nof law, of any foreign nation.” 28 U.S.C. § 1350 *136 note. The district court dismissed plaintiffs’ TVPA claims against\ndefendants Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi American Bank, and National Commercial Bank on the ground that corporate entities are\nnot “individuals” who may be sued under the TVPA. SPA52 (Terrorist Attacks I) (citing Arndt v. UBS AG, 342 F. Supp. 2d\n132, 141 (E.D.N.Y. 2004)). This conclusion is incorrect, and the issue is likely soon to be definitively resolved by the U.S.\nSupreme Court, which is considering a pending case presenting this issue.\n\nAs an initial matter, this Court has already indicated that an organizational defendant can be sued under the TVPA in\nKhulumani v. Barclay Nat’l Bank. Ltd., 504 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2007). In Khulumani, the plaintiffs asserted aiding and abetting\nclaims under the TVPA against a bank for its participation in the torture and extrajudicial killings committed by the South\nAfrican apartheid regime. /d. at 259. This Court dismissed the TVPA claims on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to allege\nthat the bank had acted under color of law, but it did not question whether the bank was a proper defendant under the TVPA\nin the first place. Jd. at 260. Based on Khulumani, the district court later held that a “corporation or other entity may ... be\nsubject to liability under the TVPA for aiding and *137 abetting” a principal violator. SPA210 (Terrorist Attacks IV); accord\nSPA234 (Terrorist Attacks V).\n\nMore importantly, the Supreme Court recently granted certiorari in Mohamad v. Rajoub, 132 8. Ct. 454 (2011), which will\nresolve a circuit split over whether the TVPA permits actions against non-natural persons. Compare Sinaltrainal v.\n\nWESTLAW\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023403",
