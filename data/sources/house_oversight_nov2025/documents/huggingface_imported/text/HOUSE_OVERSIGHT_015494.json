Cornelius Boerkoel, a clinical geneticist at the\nUniversity of British Columbia, enrolled the Topics\nin one of his studies, and so they didn’t have to pay to\nhave each of the family member’s genomes sequenced.\nThe genome tests gave Ivana and Antonia the bad\nnews about calpainopathy. Their younger brother,\nMario, is free of the disease.\n\nScientists classify calpainopathy, or “calpain,” as\na limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2a, caused\nby a mutation in the gene calpain 3, predominantly\nexpressed in skeletal muscle. Those who suffer from\nType 2a, such as Wrubel, Ivana, and Antonia, gener-\nally exhibit weak hip flexors—muscles that lift up the\nthigh. The weak flexors give them an awkward gait;\nthey swing their legs forward, landing on their toes,\nand then sometimes on the sides or soles of their feet.\nSome walk only on the balls of their feet. The upper\nbody muscle weakness creates abnormally prominent\nshoulder blades.\n\nMelissa Spencer from the University of California,\nLos Angeles, who has studied calpainopathy for 14\nyears, explains that the disease contains many sub-\ntypes.
