But that simply isn’t true, since the request to\nJustice O’ Connor—stating that it would be “beneficial” to have a letter from her as part of a\nRepublican proposal to enact a Christian Nation resolution—made it clear that she was being\nasked to write her letter specifically for use in a political campaign.\n\nWhen I got wind of Justice O’Connor’s letter, I wrote a scathing op ed for the New York Times\ncriticizing her judicial ethics as well as her miscitation of the law.\n\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor has again deplorably allowed her name and judicial office to\nbe used for partisan political purposes.\n\nIn 1987, she agreed to conduct a \"private briefing\" in the Supreme Court for Republicans\nwho contributed at least $10,000 to a political-action group. She canceled it after leading\nethics experts publicly criticized her actions as violating the Code of Judicial Conduct -\nbut not until after her name had been used in the fund-raising solicitation.\n\nJustice O'Connor recently complied with a request from an arch-conservative Arizona\nRepublican friend who had asked her to write a letter in support of a proposed party\nresolution declaring the United States to be \"a Christian Nation . . . based on the absolute\nlaw of the Bible.\"\n\nI then described what she had done and the phony excuse she had offered in defense: that she\n“had no idea” her letter would be used politically. My op ed concluded:\n\nNot only was Justice O'Connor's letter used in that [political] campaign, its miscitation of\ncases was relied on in the resolution enacted by the Arizona Republican Party. That\nresolution begins, \"Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States has three holdings to\nthe effect that this is a Christian nation . . . .\" It then cites the decisions provided by Justice\nO'Connor and declares that we are \"a Christian Nation,\" and that the Constitution created\n\"a republic based upon the absolute laws of the Bible, not a democracy.\"\n\nJustice O'Connor has twice given aid and comfort to partisan Republican causes. Both\ntimes her regrets came too late and only after public criticism. She has twice allowed her\nname and judicial office to be used improperly. She has twice violated the Code of Judicial\nConduct, which unambiguously directs sitting judges to refrain from political activity,\nincluding \"making speeches for a political organization\" and participating in political fund\nraising.\n\nA seat on the Supreme Court does not exempt a Justice from complying with the rules of\nthe profession. Justice O'Connor must remember that her allegiances are no longer to a\nparticular wing of the Arizona Republican Party but to all Americans, regardless of party\naffiliation, region or religion.\n\nI was told by several law clerks that after my op ed appeared, she was deeply embarrassed by\nwhat she had done and has not repeated the errors of her way during her subsequent years of\nservice on the Court.\n\n309\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017396",
