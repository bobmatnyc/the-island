They\ncontend that a mandatory notice posting\nrule enforceable through Section 8(a)(1)\nis needed because they believe that most\nemployees are unaware of their NLRA\nrights and therefore cannot effectively\nexercise those rights. This belief is\nbased on: (1) Some studies indicating\nthat employees and high school\nstudents about to enter the work force\nare generally uninformed about labor\nlaw; (2) an influx of immigrants in the\nlabor force who are presumably also\nuninformed about labor law; (3) the\ncurrent low and declining percentage of\nunion-represented employees in the\nprivate sector, which presumably means\nthat unions are less likely to be a source\nof information about employee rights;\nand (4) the absence of any general legal\nrequirement that employers or anyone\nelse inform employees about their\nNLRA rights. 75 FR 80411.\n\nNeither the Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking nor today’s notice\nsummarizing comments in response to\nthat notice come anywhere close to\nproviding a substantial factual basis\nsupporting the belief that most\nemployees are unaware of their NLRA\nrights. As for the lack of high school\neducation on this subject, we have only\na few localized studies cited in a 1995\njournal article by a union attorney.184\nWith respect to the assumption that\nimmigrants entering the work force, we\nhave even less, only anecdotal accounts.\nFor that matter, beyond the cited journal\narticle, almost all supposed factual\nsupport for the premise that employees\nare generally unaware of their rights\ncomes in comments received from\nindividuals, union organizers, attorneys\nrepresenting unions, and immigrant\nrights and worker assistance\norganizations agreeing, based on\nprofessed personal experience, that\nmost employees (obviously not\nincluding most of the employee\ncommenters) are unfamiliar with their\nNLRA rights. There are, as well,\nanecdotal accounts and comments from\nemployers, employer associations and\n\n184 Peter D. DeChiara, ‘‘The Right to Know: An\nArgument for Informing Employees of Their Rights\nunder the National Labor Relations Act,” 32 Harv.\nJ. on Legis. 431, at 436 and fn. 28 (1995).\n\nIn the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the\nmajority also relied on two articles by Professor\nCharles J. Morris, a co-petitioner for notice-posting\nrulemaking: “Renaissance at the NLRB—\nOpportunity and Prospect for Non-Legislative\nProcedural Reform at the Labor Board,” 23 Stetson\nL. Rev. 101, 107 (1993); and “NLRB Protection in\nthe Nonunion Workplace: A Glimpse at a General\nTheory of Section 7 Conduct,” 137 U. Pa. L. Rev.\n1673, 1675-1676 (1989). Professor Morris did not\nrefer to any specific evidence supporting a belief\nthat employees lack knowledge of their rights.\n\nmanagement attorneys to the opposite\neffect that the employees know about\ntheir rights under the Act, but my\ncolleagues find these less persuasive.\n\nIn any event, the partisan opinions\nand perceptions, although worthy of\nconsideration, ultimately fail as\nsubstantial evidence supporting the\nBoard majority’s initial premise for\nproposing the rule. There remains the\nBoard’s conclusion that the decline in\nunion density provides the missing\nfactual support. The majority explains\nthat there was less need for a posting of\ninformation about NLRA rights when\nthe union density was higher because\n“friends and family who belonged to\nunions’ would be a source of\ninformation. This is nothing more than\nsupposition. There is no empirical\nevidence of a correlation between union\ndensity and access to information about\nemployee rights, just as there are no\nbroad-based studies supporting the\nsuppositions about a lack of information\nstemming from high school curricula or\nthe influx of immigrants in the work\nforce.\n\nAt bottom, the inadequacy of the\nrecord to support my colleagues’ factual\npremise is of no matter to them. In\nresponse to comments contending that\nthe articles and studies they cite are old\nand inadequately supported, they glibly\nrespond that the commenters ‘‘cite no\nmore recent or better supported studies\nto the contrary,” as if opponents of the\nproposed rule bear that burden. Of\ncourse, it is the agency’s responsibility\nto make factual findings that support its\ndecision and those findings must be\nsupported by substantial evidence that\nmust examine the relevant data and\narticulate a satisfactory explanation for\nits action. Burlington Truck Lines, 371\nU.S. at 167.\n\nEven more telling is the majority’s\nfootnote observation that there is no real\nneed to conduct a study of the extent of\nemployees’ knowledge of NLRA rights\nbecause the notice posting rule would\nbe justified even if only 10 percent of\nthe workforce lacked such knowledge.\nThis statement betrays the entire factual\npremise upon which the rulemaking\ninitiative was purportedly founded and\nreveals a predisposition to issue the rule\nregardless of the facts. This is patently\n“arbitrary and capricious.”\n\nEven assuming, if we must, that there\nis some factual basis for a concern that\nemployees lack sufficient information\nabout their NLRA rights, the majority\nalso fails to provide a rational\nexplanation for why that concern\ndictates their choice made to address\nthat concern. Why, for instance, was a\nnoncompulsory information system,\nprimarily reliant on personal union\n\ncommunications, sufficient when the\nWagner Act was passed, but not now?\nThe union density levels for 1935 and\ntoday are roughly the same.185 Why at\na time when the Board champions its\nnew Web site and the Acting General\nCounsel continues to encourage the\nregional outreach programs initiated by\nhis predecessor, do my colleagues so\nreadily dismiss the Board’s role in\nproviding information about rights\nunder the statute we administer? For\nthat matter, why are the numerous\nemployee, labor organizer, and worker\nadvocacy groups whose comments\nprofess awareness of these rights unable\nto communicate this information to\nthose who they know lack such\nawareness? Is the problem one of access\nor message? Would a reversal of the\nunion density trend or an increase in\npetition and charge filings be the only\nreliable indicators of increased\nawareness?\n\nI would think that a reasoned\nexplanation for the choice of a sweeping\nrule making it unlawful for employers to\nfail to post and maintain notice of\nemployee rights would at least include\nsome discussion of these questions and\nattempt to marshal more than a\nfragmented and inconclusive factual\nrecord to support their choice. The\nmajority fails to do so. Their rule is\npatently arbitrary and capricious.\n\nExecutive Order 13496\n\nThe majority mentions in passing\nExecutive Order 13496 186 and the DOL\nimplementing regulation 187 mandating\nthat Federal contractors post a notice to\nemployees of NLRA rights that is in\nmost respects identical to the notice at\nissue here. Their consideration of this\nadministrative action should have led\nthem to the understanding that they lack\nthe authority to do what the President\nand DOL clearly could do to advance\nessentially the same policy choice.\n\nThe authority to require that\ncontractors agree to post an NLRA\nemployee rights notice as part of doing\nbusiness with the Federal government\ncomes both from the President’s\nauthority as chief executive and the\nspecific grant of Congressional authority\nin the Federal Property and\nAdministrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C.\n101 et seq. There was no need or\nattempt to justify the promulgation of\nthe notice-posting rule by relying on\nevidence that employees lacked\nknowledge of their rights.
