To digitize life completely, we need to stimulate\nevery relevant nerve ending in the human body in real-time — skin, ears,\neyes, balance, pain centers, and so on.\n\nAt the low end, a ‘perfect? IMAX production would require 360\ndegree stereoscopic projection and the generation of a full sound field.\nThis would take 3 Gigabits per second for the audio field and 5,600 terabits\nper second for the video field. This could be substantially reduced if the\nperson wears virtual reality glasses to track their head and eye move-\nments, but then you are substituting resolution with computer power.\n\nAt the high end, a team at the US Department of Energy’s Fermilab\nestimate reality needs one hundred trillion samples per inch for a\n‘simple quantum representation. If we look at the many worlds view of\nquantum mechanics, each photon hitting our eye can’t be fully described\nby a single number. The photon may be entangled with other realities\nwe should keep track of. This causes our picture of reality to become\nwildly complex. Everything we might see and experience is in some way\na combination of possibilities, and these possibilities all interact. Real life\nis very complex.\n\nSymbolic Communication\n\nComputers have no concept of an in-person meeting. They communicate\nusing purely symbolic methods in binary numbers. These have the same\nmeaning whether communicated over a short piece of wire or using a\nfiber optic cable half way around the world. Computers never have to\ncommunicate understanding to each other because they use programs\nand a program can be perfectly transmitted. Body language is, of course,\ncompletely alien to them!\n\nWe know there are non-computable things; functions, numbers,\nmusical melodies, and mathematical puzzles. Why would there not also\nbe a place for non-computation in communication? David Deutsch has\nsuggested human creativity is used to guess the ‘program’ running in\nsomeone's mind, and evolved so we can learn skills. Instead, might face-\nto-face communication be important because it lets us impart knowledge\nin a non-symbolic manner?\n\nHyper-communication\n\nAs with hyper-computing, hyper-communication is controversial. We\ninstinctively know human communication is very different to computer\ncommunication. Face-to-face communications have a qualitatively\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015983",
