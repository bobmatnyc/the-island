Lejoni Williams\nwas all over the field and led us in\ntackles.”\n\nThe Broncos added a late touch-\ndown from Diego Luna and two-\npoint conversion from Hernan Velez\nfor the final score.\n\n“T was playing all my guys at that\npoint,” Cofiell said. “I wanted to give\neveryone the experience of playing in\nPuerto Rico.”\n\nAfter the game, the Broncos set up\na meet-and-greet between both team\nand an innovative idea came out of it.\n\n“They took care of us all week-\nend,” Cofiell said. “They gave us a\nplace to stay and ground transporta-\ntion. They even took us sightseeing of\nold San Juan before being dropped at\nthe airport.\n\n“We invited them to come to St.\nCroix and play us during the Vir-\ngin Islands-Puerto Rico Friendship\nweekend; hopefully it could be a\nyearly thing. Either they come one\nyear or we go, this was a positive ex-\nperience for us.”\n\n“This was an amazing event,”\nJuncos head coach Manuel Santiago\nsaid. “We were very happy to host\nthem and we enjoyed them, too. This\nwas an excellent opportunity to open\nour relationship and we are working\non coming to St. Croix in October.”\n\nSt. Thomas schools Charlotte\nAmalie and Eudora Kean, the 2016\nSt. Thomas-St. John IAA champs,\n\nThe Virgin Islands Daily News 35\n\nPhoto courtesy SCOTT COFIELL\n\nThe players and coaches from the St. Croix Educational Complex and Juncos Broncos football teams gather at midfield for a postgame photo after the\nBarricudas’ 20-8 win over the Broncos on Saturday at Pista Atletica Municipal de Juncos in Puerto Rico.\n\nplayed teams from Puerto Rico last\nmonth, losing to the Dorado Spartans\nand University Garden Dolphins, re-\nspectively, in games played at Lionel\nRoberts Stadium.\n\n“I think we should have a com-\nbined league with Puerto Rico,” Co-\nfiell said. “We play one home and one\naway every year. Look, our ticket cost\n$150, that’s not much more than fly-\ning to St. Thomas. It could be done.\n\nBut before we approach Puerto Rico,\nwe would need a unified league be-\ntween St. Thomas and St. Croix\nagreeing on stuff to make it happen.\nThen we could move on to Puerto\nRico, They are not that far away.\n“They are more Puerto Rican teams\nthan Virgin Islands teams. A mixed\nschedule will have to be created with\na Caribbean champion between the\nwinners of each league. People are re-\n\nally interested in playing in football.
