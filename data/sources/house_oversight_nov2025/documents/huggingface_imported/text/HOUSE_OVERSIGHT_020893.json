The same concept\nextends beyond healthcare recipients to the healthcare providers.*\n\ne When Medicare was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to elderly\nAmericans, 1 in 10 Americans received Medicare, now 1 in 7 Americans receives\nMedicare...above the initial ‘plan.’\n\nNote: *The issue that people overuse services for which they do not have personal financial commitment applies to most\nprivate insurance as well. For a more detailed discussion, see slide 293. Data are inflation adjusted using BEA’s GDP price\n\nKP index.
