  "text": "Emerging market equities\n\nPreference: overweight\n\nMSCI EM (24 Oct.): 995 (last publication: 990)\nUBS View MSCI EM 6-month target: 1,040\n\ne The downward revisions to the emerging market GDP growth forecasts appear to be coming to an end.\nWe expect emerging market GDP growth to accelerate to 5.3% in 2013 from this year's 4.7%.\n\n¢ Monetary policy in the US, the Eurozone, and Japan remains supportive. One implication of these low\ninterest rate policies, we believe, will be to enhance emerging market (EM) equity returns in USD by\nsupporting EM currencies more broadly against the USD over the next six months.\n\ne In our base case, we see the P/E multiple of the MSCI EM Index staying around the current level of 11x\ntrailing (i.e. realized) earnings over the next six months. Over the next 12 months, we expect EM earnings\ngrowth of around 11% (slightly below consensus).\n\ne Over the past month, structural reforms that will have longer-term benefits were announced in India\n(retail sector), Russia (energy sector) and Mexico (labor market). This highlights that the emerging\neconomies have options to improve the competitiveness of their economies, if they choose to do so.\n\n4 Positive scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 1,325\n\n¢ The outlook for the global economy improves, boosting EM's ability to grow more strongly in 2013. This\nstronger economic growth leads to earnings growth of 15%. Investor confidence improves, leading to a\nbetter P/E multiple of 14x trailing earnings. If oil prices rose too, Russia would benefit in this scenario.\n\n& Negative scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 800\n\n¢ A significant escalation in the Eurozone, a sharp fiscal contraction in the US, and a rapid deceleration in\nChinese growth could each hit EM's economic prospects. In such a scenario, we would expect a 20% decline\nin earnings over six months. More defensive Malaysia would do better, whereas more cyclical South Korea\nand Russia would underperform. We assume, however, that the market would also be expecting some\nrecovery in earnings for 2014, helping the P/E multiple to recover to 10x trailing earnings.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nInvestors are trying to figure out which emerging market central banks still have\nroom to ease monetary policy and where rates may be heading up. Inflation\ndata is due for Russia (6 Nov), Brazil (7 Nov), China (9 Nov), India (14\nNov) and South Africa (21 Nov).\n\nThe prices of grains and oil are higher than this time last year. For now, negative\noutput gaps should counterbalance some of this inflationary pressure.\n\nEmerging market\nmonetary policy\n\nFood and oil prices\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne Within emerging markets, we have a\npreference over six months for the large\nequity markets, Brazil, China and South\nKorea. We expect an acceleration of\ngrowth into 2013 in Brazil and South\nKorea, and a stabilization in the case of\nChina. We see relatively less upside for\nmore defensive Malaysia. We believe that\nSouth Africa and Indonesia are expensive.\nThe ECB's announcement that it stands\nready to buy the bonds of compliant\nEurozone governments has lessened the\ntail risks for the smaller European\nemerging equity markets (Turkey,\nHungary, Poland), but their equity markets\nare susceptible to setbacks.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne Strategically, we would advise that EM\nportfolios tilt toward cash-rich and faster-\ngrowing Asia.\n\nCountry preferences within emerging\nmarkets (relative to MSCI EM)\n\nCurrent most Current least\npreferred markets preferred markets\nBrazil Indonesia\n\nChina Malaysia\nSouth Korea South Africa\n\nFor further information please contact CIO asset class specialist Costa Vayenas, costa.vayenas@ubs.com 19\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025266",
