  "text": "Judge Ruth Pickholz was flabbergasted. She couldn’t understand why the DA would want to go easy on Epstein, after the New York State\nBoard of Examiners of Sex Offenders recommended the Level 3 status because there was more than just the one victim for which he\n\npleaded guilty.\n\n“I have to tell you, I’m a little overwhelmed because | have never seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this,” the judge said at the\n\nhearing.\nDespite the DA’s arguments, Pickholz slapped Epstein with Level 3 status, which was upheld on appeal.\n\n“The strong evidence that the offenses against the other victims did occur outweighs any inferences to be drawn from the manner in which\nthis case was prosecuted in Florida,” the New York Court of Appeals said in its ruling.\n\nWhen asked for comment, the DA’s Office referred The Post to court documents stating that the prosecution's position was based “largely\non the mistaken notion” that only the formal charges against Epstein could be factors in the decision.\n\nThe jet-setting financier has been making headlines in recent days after Virginia Roberts, 30, claimed he pimped her to Britain’s Prince\n\nAndrew.\n\nPrince Andrew has denied the accusations against him.\n\nFILED UNDER JEFFREY EPSTEIN, PRINCE ANDREW, VIRGINIA ROBERTS\n\nRecommended by\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016460",
