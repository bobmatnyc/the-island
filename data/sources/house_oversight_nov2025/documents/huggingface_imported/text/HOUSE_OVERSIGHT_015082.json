  "text": "the late Marilyn Monroe using the telephone in her Hollywood bathroom\nto make a long distance call to New York Post film-gossip columnist\nSidney Skolsky.\n\n“Sid, you won't believe this,“ she had whispered, “but the\nAttorney General of our country is waiting for me in my bed this very\n\nminute--I just had to tell you.”\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain where on the continuum of Lyndon\nJohnson's personality innocent boorishness ends and deliberate sadism\nbegins. To have summoned then-Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon\nfor a conference wherein he, the new president, sat defecating as he spoke,\nmight charitably be an example of the former; but to challenge under the\nsame circumstances Senator J. William Fulbright for his opposition to\nAdministration policy in Vietnam is considered by insiders to be a\nfrightening instance of the latter. The more Jacqueline Kennedy has tried\nto erase the crudeness of her husband's successor from consciousness, the\nmore it has impinged upon her memories and reinforced her resentment.\n\n“It's beyond style,” she would confide to friends. “Jack had style, but\n\nthis is beyond style.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015082",
