Push him,” I\nsaid. “When he presents his recommended action, ask him for his assessment of\nwhat Hizbollah will do in response. When he, or the head of military intelligence,\nhas given you the range of possibilities and told you which is the most likely, say,\nOK, let’s assume that happens. What’s our next step? How is that going to lead us\nto our main objectives? And what are the objectives?” Newspaper reports the next\nmorning said that Shimon, and only Shimon, did indeed press the chief-of-staff\nabout each further stage of the operation and about the aims that we wanted to\naccomplish. But Halutz finally fobbed him off by saying that once they gof to the\nlater phases, they could discuss it.\n\nFrom the first reports I received through my army contacts, I feared the\noperation would go badly. There was no doubt we could inflict damage on\nHizbollah. But there were no clear answers to the questions Shimon had raised.\nThe initial Israeli air force response had been put in place more than five years\nearlier, when I was Prime Minister. Codenamed “Operation Cinnamon Sticks,” it\nwas designed to take out all of the fixed Hizbollah missile sites we had been able\nto identify. We knew its limitations. A lot of the rockets were fired from mobile\nlaunchers. But in one exercise, the known “Hizbollah” sites were replicated in the\nGalilee. They were destroyed in 43 minutes. I had no doubt that part of the plan\nwould succeed. In the early hours of July 13, it took only 34 minutes to destroy the\nnearly 60 launchers we had pinpointed over the previous five years.\n\nBut Operation Cinnamon Sticks had been intended as a first step in a far wider\nassault on Hizbollah and other targets, including a number of infrastructure\ninstallations, deeper inside Lebanon. It was part of a plan for a full-scale war, if the\ngovernment decided that was necessary. As the early public statements by Olmert\nand other ministers made clear, they did not intend to start a war, at least at the\noutset. They certainly didn’t have a coherent plan for one. But they would soon\nfind themselves in Israel’s longest single armed conflict since 1948. When\nHizbollah fired hundreds of missiles at Israeli towns and cities, our operation\nintensified not by plan or military logic, but improvisation. As a former Prime\n\n400\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011871",
