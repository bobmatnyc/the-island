  "text": "2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 81\n\nFor purposes of this Article, it is appropriate to focus on the last two of\nthese three rights: the right to confer and the nght to fair treatment. The\nfirst of these three rights—the right to be reasonably protected—is already\nclearly extended by another statute to crime victims before the filing of\ncharges. While OLC does not acknowledge this fact, the VRRA extends\nthe first right to crime victims, directing that a “responsible official shall\narrange for a victim to receive reasonable protection from a suspected\noffender and persons acting in concert with or at the behest of the suspected\noffender.”'*! Because a “suspected” offender obviously exists before the\nfiling of criminal charges, the VRRA envisions the right to protection being\nprovided as soon as is practical after a victim suffers from the commission\nof a crime. Additionally, the sections of the Attorney General Guidelines\nfor Victim and Witness Assistance addressing the VRRA direct that Justice\nDepartment components must provide reasonable protection even before the\nfiling of criminal charges.'*? So, under the VRRA, the Justice Department\nshould already be providing reasonable protection for a victim before an\noffender is indicted, regardless of how the CVRA is interpreted!”\n\nThe VRRA, however, does not contain a right to confer and a right to\nfair treatment and respect for the victim’s dignity. Therefore, if victims are\ngoing to receive these statutory rights before trial, these rights must be\nfound in the CVRA. With regard to the CVRA provision that victims have\nthe “reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the\ncase,”!*+ OLC contends that “[t]he phrase ‘in the case’ implies the pendency\nof a judicial proceeding.”'*? To bolster its conclusion, OLC then cites\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, which includes among its several definitions of the\nword “case” the definition “a civil or criminal proceeding.”'*° But OLC\ndoes not acknowledge that Black’s Law Dictionary also defines and\nexemplifies a “case” more broadly as a “criminal investigation <the\n\nnotification of rights before charges are filed). For purposes of this Article, it is not\nnecessary to explore this right in detail. If other CVRA rights apply before charges are filed,\na fortiori this right does as well. If a victim has a right, presumably the victim should be\nnotified of the existence of that right.\n\n121 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(2) (2006) (emphasis added).\n\n122 See ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 7-8, 26-28.\n\n123 Exactly what “reasonable protection” means, however, remains uncertain. See\ngenerally Mary Margaret Giannini, Redeeming an Empty Promise: Procedural Justice, the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act, and the Victim’s Right to Be Reasonably Protected from the\nAccused, 78 TENN. L. REV. 47 (2010) (suggesting the right has not been adequately defined\nand proposing ways to do so).\n\n14 18 U.S.C. § 3771(aN(5).\n\n125 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 8.\n\n126 Td. (citing BLACK’s LAW DICTIONARY, supra note 59, at 243).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014060",
