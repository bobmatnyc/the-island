  "text": "Due to the lower capitalisation of local stock and\nbond markets, economic performance in DM Low\nFME countries is relatively less vulnerable to financial\nshocks than in DM High FME markets, giving Low FME\ncentral banks greater freedom to invest in higher risk\nasset classes. Furthermore, whereas most High FME\ncentral banks self-assess ‘ample’ reserves adequacy,\nthe majority of Low FME central bank respondents\ndescribe reserve levels as ‘sufficient’, and are\ntherefore more likely to seek higher returns through\nthe investment tranche to improve their long-term\nreserves adequacy position (figure 31).\n\nTypically, emerging market central banks have the\nlowest levels of reserves adequacy due in large part to\ngreater vulnerability to foreign shocks. Indeed, certain\nemerging market central banks with a currency peg\nnoted that falling commodity prices had created\npressure on the local currency, causing a drawdown\nof foreign reserves to maintain the peg. Countries\nwith more flexible exchange rate arrangements are\ninstead seeking greater exposure to risk asset classes\nto generate positive returns to preserve capital and\nmaintain reserves adequacy.\n\nFig 31.
