  "text": "144 Teaching Minds\n\nPalin: Charlie, if there is legitimate and enough intelligence that\ntells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we\nhave every right to defend our country. In fact, the president\nhas the obligation, the duty to defend.\n\nI suppose it is not a crime to not know the doctrine of the sitting\npresident from your own party when you are running for vice presi-\ndent, but it does seem odd. But what is worse, is that after being told\nwhat that doctrine is, Palin is content to ramble on incoherently.\nWhy doesn’t this bother her? Clearly this is not a real issue because it\ndoesn’t bother her supporters either.\n\nHere is some more from that interview:\n\nGibson: But this is not just reforming a government. This is also\nrunning a government on the huge international stage in\na very dangerous world. When I asked John McCain about\nyour national security credentials, he cited the fact that you\nhave commanded the Alaskan National Guard and that\nAlaska is close to Russia. Are those sufficient credentials?\n\nPalin: But it is about reform of government and it’s about putting\ngovernment back on the side of the people, and that has\nmuch to do with foreign policy and national security issues.\nLet me speak specifically about a credential that I do bring to\nthis table, Charlie, and that’s with the energy independence\nthat I’ve been working on for these years as the governor\nof this state that produces nearly 20% of the U.S. domestic\nsupply of energy, that I worked on as chairman of the Alaska\nOil and Gas Conservation Commission, overseeing the oil\nand gas development in our state to produce more for the\nUnited States.\n\nGibson: I know. I’m just saying that national security is a whole\nlot more than energy.\n\nKnowledge should matter for high government officials, but it doesn’t\nmatter precisely because the people who are listening have no knowl-\nedge either. Is Sarah Palin intelligent? There are plenty who would\nsay that she is not. These include those who rank coherent thinking\nand the ability to create coherent explanations high on their list of\nwhat constitutes intelligence. But, it should be clear, that is not what\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023890",
