His\nresearch investigates people’s ability to reason\nabout others’ minds, from knowing how one is\nbeing judged by others to predicting others'\nattitudes, beliefs, and underlying motivations,\nand the implications of systematic mistakes in\nmind reading for everyday social interactions.\nHis research has appeared in more than two\ndozen journals, has been featured by the Wall\nStreet Journal, CNN, Wired, and National Public\nRadio, among many others, and has been funded\nby the National Science Foundation and the\nTempleton Foundation. Epley has written for the\nNew York Times, produced lectures for the\nFinancial Times, been elected as a Fellow of the\nAssociation for Psychological Science, and is the\nwinner of the 2008 Theoretical Innovation Prize\nfrom the Society for Personality and Social\nPsychology.\n\nOther minds are inherently invisible.\nYou cannot see an attitude, smell a belief, or\ntouch an intention, and yet you can nevertheless\n“see” these mental states in other people with\ngreat ease. You can even see them in agents\nranging from pets to gadgets to gods. How you\nare able to see other minds, and how they\nbecome visible, matters because it marks the\ndifference between treating others as human\nbeings worthy of moral care and concern versus\ntreating others as objects or animals.\n\nPage |93\n\npassengers were rescued, cold, wet, and\nalmost completely unharmed. Explained\none passenger, “God was certainly\nlooking out for us.” New Orleans Mayor\nRay Nagin offered a very different\nassessment of God’s mind following the\ndevastating impact of Hurricane Katrina\nwhen he explained that, “Surely God is\nmad at America. Surely he’s not\napproving of us being in Iraq under false\npretense. But surely he’s upset at Black\nAmerica, too.”\n\nDepending on your own beliefs,\nsuch statements will seem somewhere\nbetween insane and insightful. To\npsychologists, they seem impressive.\nThey seem impressive not because they\nreveal a keen sense of causal inference,\nbut rather because they reveal what may\nbe the most impressive capacities of the\nsocial brain—the ability to reason about,\nor “to see,” what other minds see.\nIntrospection enables you to know your\nown intentions, report on your own\nthoughts, feel your own pain, and\nrecognize when you are feeling shame\nrather than guilt. Other minds, however,\nare inherently invisible. You cannot\nknow what it is like to be another person\non the inside because your skull gets in\nthe way.\n\nThe inherent invisibility of other\nminds poses a major problem for hard-\nnosed philosophers, who skeptically note\nthat people cannot infer that other minds\nexist at all. Although it is surprisingly\ndifficult for philosophers to reject the\nskeptical conclusion from the “other\nminds problem,” almost everyone else\ncasts it aside altogether some time\naround the age of five. At this point\npeople have developed such a strong\ncapacity to think about other minds that\nthey not only see minds in other people,\nbut they seem to see other minds almost\neverywhere’.
