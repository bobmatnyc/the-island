  "text": "/ BARAK / 128\n\nI issued a standing directive in the kirya that we should agree to anything\nFayyad asked for, as long as there no security reason to say no. We ended up\narranging a direct source of fuel supply to Jenin, on the northern edge of the West\nBank, and built new terminals to handle it. We facilitated construction permits for\na new industrial zone. For a conference of international economists and business\npeople, we set up VIP treatment at Ben-Gurion Airport, and limousine transport to\nthe conference venue. I believed that if Fayyad succeeded in what he was trying to\naccomplish, it would be a benefit not just for the Palestinians, but for Israel too.\nBibi was agnostic on Fayyad’s efforts. Yet he recognized they did no harm. And in\na way, my support for them was politically convenient. To the extent the\ninternational community, especially the Americans, appreciated our efforts to help\nthe Palestinians, Bibi and others in the government could, and did, claim credit.\nWhen there were complaints from the right, Bibi could and did say: “It wasn’t me.\nIt was Barak.”\n\nMy part in our relations with the Americans was more politically delicate. As I\ncontinued to prod Bibi toward accepting a settlement freeze during the summer and\nautumn of 2009, my de facto role became to help smooth over the increasingly\nrough edges in our ties with the Obama administration. I knew key figures from\nearlier incarnations in their public lives and mine: Secretary of Defense Bob Gates,\nwho had been President George H. W. Bush’s deputy security adviser 1n the first\nIraq war and then head of the CIA; and Hillary Clinton, now Secretary of State.\nDuring a series of early trips to the US as Defense Minister, I met Gates, Hillary\nand other senior figures in the administration both formally and informally. In part\nbecause they were aware I favored agreeing to a settlement freeze, they clearly\nfound it a lot easier to talk to me than to Bibi. On one visit, to my regret and Bibi’s\nevident frustration once I’d got home, the press highlighted this dramatic\ndifference in mood. Emerging from talks with me at the State Department, Hillary\ntold reporters that our talks had gone “wonderfully.” She added: “As longtime\nfriends do, much was said. And much didn’t need to be said.” Still, I was careful to\navoid any explicit criticism of Bibi in my meetings in the US. I would point out the\ndomestic political pressures on him in deciding how to proceed. And in any case,\nthe Americans knew that no matter what I might say to them, it was Bibi’s actions\nthat ultimately mattered. He, not I, was Prime Minister.\n\nI was as surprised as they were when he finally announced a settlement freeze\nin November 2009. As with nearly everything else he did regarding the peace\n\nA14\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011885",
