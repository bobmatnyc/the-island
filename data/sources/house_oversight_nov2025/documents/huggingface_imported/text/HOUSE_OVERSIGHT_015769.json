  "text": "in person for their second negotiation session, this time at the\n\nH6fdi House in Reykjavik. For five days, the leaders talked alone\nexcept for interpreters. Reagan badly wanted to develop the Strategic\nDefense Initiative; known by its nickname, ‘Star Wars. The idea was to\nput smart weaponry in space that could destroy ballistic missiles before\nthey reentered the atmosphere. Reagan believed this would remove the\nthreat of imminent destruction that had hung over the world since 1945.\nGorbachev, on the other hand, felt this was just another escalation in\nthe Cold War, and the Soviet Union would be forced to build yet more\nweapons to overcome the American defenses. He wanted Reagan's plans\nshelved, arguing that it broke the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. He was\nprobably right. The leaders talked back and forth, unable to overcome\nthe impasse. At the end of the summit there was a mad scramble to\nannounce some sort of deal, but this proved difficult. In the last moments\nbefore they had to conclude a communiqué, Reagan suggested they\nabolish ai/ nuclear weapons. Reagan's negotiating team was horrified and\nshut the door.\n\nFor decades, the American strategy had been to use nuclear\nweapons as a deterrent against the apparent numerical advantage of the\nSoviets. In all the potential scenarios analyzed by the Pentagon, Russian\nforces ended up overrunning American forward positions — otherwise\nknown as Western Europe! The only way to stop them was through a\nrelease of nuclear weapons, which, inevitably escalated to all-out nuclear\n\nat.\n\n[: the summer of 1986 Ronald Reagan and Mikael Gorbachev met\n\n+\n\nX\n\nRonald Reagan and Mikael Gorbachev\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015769",
