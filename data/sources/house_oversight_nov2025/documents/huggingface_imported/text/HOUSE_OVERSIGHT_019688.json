With a multibillion-dollar “black\nbudget” hidden from public scrutiny, the NSA’s technology director-\nate invested in state-of-the-art equipment, including supercomputers\nthat could break almost any cipher, antennas mounted on geosyn-\nchronous satellites that vacuumed in billions of foreign telephone\ncalls, and other exotic capabilities. It also devised stealthy means of\nbreaking into channels that its adversaries believed were secure. This\nenterprise required not only an army of technical specialists capable\nof remotely intercepting even the faintest traces of electromagnetic\nsignals, hacking into computers, and eavesdropping on distant con-\nversations but also special units called “tailored access operations,”\nto plant listening devices in embassies and diplomatic pouches. The\nNSA also organized elaborate expeditions to give access to or even\npenetrate physical cables in enemy territory. In 1971, for example,\nthe NSA sent a specially equipped submarine into Russia’s Sea of\nOkhotsk in Asia to tap through Arctic ice. The target was a Russian\ncable four hundred feet below the surface that connected the Rus-\n© sian naval headquarters in Vladivostok with a missile testing range. ©\n\nIn 1980, President Ronald Reagan gave the NSA a clear mandate\nto expand its interception of foreign communications. In Executive\nOrder 12333, he told the NSA that “all means, consistent with appli-\ncable Federal law and this [Executive] order, and with full consider-\nation of the rights of United States persons, shall be used to obtain\nreliable intelligence information to protect the United States and its\ninterests.” It did not restrict any foreign country, either an adversary\nor an ally, from its surveillance.\n\nThe NSA’s target soon became nothing short of the entire elec-\ntromagnetic spectrum. “We are approaching a time when we will\nbe able to survey almost any point on the earth’s surface with some\nsensor,” Admiral Stansfield Turner, the former director of central\nintelligence, wrote in 1985. “We should soon be able to keep track\nof most of the activities on the surface of the earth.” Bobby Ray\nInman, a former director of the NSA and deputy director of the CIA,\nargued that the “vastness of the [American] intelligence ‘take’ from\nthe Soviet Union, and the pattern of continuity going back years,\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 200 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019688",
