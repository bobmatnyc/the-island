  "text": "quartile benchmarks for U.S. venture capital healthcare and/or U.S. total venture\ncapital.”\n\ne Exceeded relevant public equity indices by substantial margins on all realized funds:\nMembers of the New Leaf team invested $1.02 billion in the portfolios of healthcare\ntechnology investments in four Sprout Capital funds (Sprout Capital IX, L.P., Sprout\nCapital VII, L.P., Sprout Capital VI, L.P. and Sprout Growth H, L.P.), and these are now\nfully realized (or near fully realized in the case of Sprout Capital IX, L.P.). The net\nannual IRR’s on the healthcare technology portfolios in these funds outperformed the\nS&P 500 (568 - 2,258 bps), S&P Healthcare (302 - 2,064 bps), NASDAQ Composite (451 -\n2,125 bps), and the Russell 3000 (502 - 2,215 bps) using the Public Market Equivalent\nPlus (PME+) methodology’. Although PME+ methodology is most informative when\nused to analyze funds whose returns are mature, the PME+ methodology shows that\nNLV-I is outperforming these same indices, and shows encouraging results for NLV-II\ndespite its relative immaturity.\n\nIt is this consistently high level of return over an 18 year period, spanning several challenging\ninvestment cycles, that creates a truly unique track record within the venture capital sector.\n\nThe chart below illustrates details of the gross and net performance by fund.\n\nChart 1: Returns by Fund\nAs of March 31, 2014\n($ in millions)\nFund:\nFund Size:\nPaid-In Capital\nVintage Year: | )\nFirst Investment 1995 1995 1998 2000 2005 2008\nGross Fund Returns\n= ee\nTotal Multiple 4.4x 2.6X 1.7x 2.0x 2.1x 1.8x\nRealized Multiple 4.4x 2.6x 1.7x 2.2x 1.7x 2.0x\nTotal IRR ° 44% 19% 10% 15% 19% 30%\nRealized IRR 44% 19% 10% 17% 23% 33%\nNet Fund Returns\nok ok ok ok\nNet Total Multiple 3.69x , 2.17 , 1.49x , 1.66x , 1.75x 1.45x\nNet Total IRR _ 28.9% . 12.0% - 6.0% . 9.3% 12.0% 16.7%\nNet Distributed / Paid-In Multiple r 3.69x 2.17x 1.49x 1.55x~ 0.51x 0.50x\nNet Distributed $s to LPs $56.3 $207.0 $218.7 $L071.5 $154.7 $204.2\nInterim Fund Liquidity Metrics\n(Distributed + Public) / Paid-In Multiple H - - - 1.62x 0.74x 1.18x\n(Distributed + Liquid Public) / Paid-In Multiple -- - -- 1.58x 0.57x 0.75x\nIRR Outperformance Versus Public Indices se\nPME+ (Basis Points over S&P 500 Healthcare Sector) +2,064 bps +302 bps +441 bps +776 bps +201 bps -187 bps\nPME+ (Basis Points over S&P 500) - +2,258 bps +568 bps +587 bps +638 bps +496 bps +275 bps\nPME+ (Basis Points over Russell 3000) sew +2,215 bps +554 bps +502 bps +565 bps +446 bps +218 bps\nPME+ (Basis Points over Nasdaq Composite) +2,125 bps +554 bps +725 bps +451 bps +181 bps -21 bps\nNLV and Sprout fund data as of March 31, 2014.
