Objective: an alliance\nbetween right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections\n\nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru\nwho was Donald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following\nthe racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the\nDaily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in\nthe heart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in\nview of the European elections which will be held in spring 2019.\n\nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor\nof the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in\nsupport of NGOs dealing with human rights.

Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and\nchanneling funding.\n\nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a\nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May.\n\nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own.\n\nThe American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US\nCongress — and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019339",
