  "text": "te OK ok\n\nSection 1 Study Guide\n\nA regular reader who goes by SnowdropExplodes suggested that I add \"study guides” to\nthe end of each section of this book in order to pull it together, and I thought it was a\ngood idea. (See why I love my readers?) I'm sure that others could find this insufferably\npatronizing, however; if you're one of them, feel free not to read the guides! I'm just\ntrying to offer questions for further thought, and give some insight on why I organized\nthis book the way I did. This section was intended to pull together the ideas I see as\n\"basic\" or \"building blocks\" for feminist sex, both in theory and in practice.\n\nKOK ok\n\n1. Have any of these pieces felt relevant to how you communicate with your partners?\nHave any pieces felt irrelevant or incomprehensible? Can you see any overarching\nthemes that guide which ones felt relevant, and which ones felt incomprehensible?\n\nla. If you could give your partners one piece of advice about communicating with you,\nwhat would it be?\n\n1b. Are there areas of communication that you feel you need to work on? (For example,\nClarisse often thinks that she should work on her non-verbal communication, and has\noccasionally had trouble being direct with her partners about what she wants.)\n\nlc. What ideas about sex and communication do you think you've absorbed from friends,\nparents, and your larger cultural environment?\n\nKK Ok\n\n2. What stereotypes do you see acting on your sexuality?\n\n2a. Have you come up with any mental tactics for thinking around those stereotypes?\nWhat are they? (For example, Clarisse sees the \"S&M superpowers\" concept as a positive\nway of framing S&M, so it doesn't feel \"broken\" or \"dark.\")\n\nte ok ok\n\n3. Are there any areas of your sexuality where you feel trapped or stalled? Can you think\nof ways that you want to move forward on those, or do you think it might be a good idea\nto take some time off from those activities instead?\n\nte Kk ok\n\n4. If you were feeling anxious about a relationship or uncertain about your boundaries,\nwho would you turn to in order to talk about that? Do you have friends (online or offline)\nor other resources where you could find advice?\n\n4a. Are there unique problems affecting abusive relationships within the communities\nyou frequent? How do sexual stereotypes affect how you and your friends perceive both\npositive relationships and abusive relationships?\n\nte Ok ok\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018559",
