  "text": "12.9 AGI Ethics As Related to Various Future Scenarios 237\n\npragmatic underlying ethical pedagogy and experiential grounding may prove to be even more\ndangerous than our messy human mental ecologies.\n\nIf one assumes a hard takeoff AGI, then all this must be codified in the system at launch,\nas once a potentially Singularitarian AGI is launched there is no way to know what time\nperiod constitutes “before the singularity point.” This means developing theory of mind empathy\nand logical ethics in code prior to giving the system unfettered access to hardware and self-\nmodification code. However, though nobody can predict if or when a Singularity will occur\nafter unrestricted launch, only a truly irresponsible AGI development team would attempt to\ncreate an AGI without first experimenting with ethical training of the system in an intelligence-\ncapped form, by means of ethical instruction via human-AGI interaction both pedagogically\nand experientially.\n\n12.9.4 Global Brain Mindplex Scenarios\n\nAnother class of scenarios — overlapping some of the previous ones — involves the emergence\nof a “Global Brain,” an emergent intelligence formed from global communication networks in-\ncorporating humans and software programs in a larger body of self-organizing dynamics. The\nnotion of the Global Brain is reviewed in [Hey07, Tur77] and its connection with advanced\nAI is discussed in detail in Goertzel’s book Creating Internet Intelligence [Goe01], where three\npossible phases of “Global Brain” development are articulated:\n\ne Phase 1: computer and communication technologies as enhancers of human\ninteractions. This is what we have today: science and culture progress in ways that would\nnot be possible if not for the “digital nervous system” we’re spreading across the planet.\nThe network of idea and feeling sharing can become much richer and more productive than\nit is today, just through incremental development, without any Metasystem transition.\n\ne Phase 2: the intelligent Internet. At this point our computer and communication sys-\ntems, through some combination of self-organizing evolution and human engineering, have\nbecome a coherent mind on their own, or a set of coherent minds living in their own digital\nenvironment.\n\ne Phase 3: the full-on Singularity. A complete revision of the nature of intelligence, human\nand otherwise, via technological and intellectual advancement totally beyond the scope of\nour current comprehension. At this point our current psychological and cultural realities\nare no more relevant than the psyche of a goose is to modern society.\n\nThe main concern of Creating Internet Intelligence is with\n\ne how to get from Phase 1 to Phase 2 - i.e. how to build an AGI system that will effect or\nencourage the transformation of the Internet into a coherent intelligent system\n\ne how to ensure that the Phase 2, Internet-savvy, global-brain-centric AGI systems will be\noriented toward intelligence-improving self-modification (so they’ll propel themselves to\nPhase 3), and also toward generally positive goals (as opposed to, say, world domination\nand extermination of all other intelligent life forms besides themselves!)\n\nOne possibly useful concept in this context is that of a mindplex: an intelligence that is\ncomposed largely of individual intelligences with their own self-models and global workspaces,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013153",
