Thus, it is\nproper for the Board to consider a\nknowing and willful failure to post the\nnotice as evidence of unlawful motive.\nHowever, the Board has noticed that\nit employed somewhat inconsistent\nlanguage in the NPRM regarding the\nconsideration of failure to post the\nnotice as evidence of antiunion animus.\nThus, the caption of paragraph\n104.214(b) reads: “Knowing\nnoncompliance as evidence of unlawful\nmotive.’ However, the paragraph itself\nstates that “If an employer has actual or\nconstructive knowledge of the\nrequirement to post the notice and fails\nor refuses to do so, the Board may\nconsider such a willful refusal as\nevidence of unlawful motive in a case\nin which motive is an issue.”’ (Emphasis\nadded in both cases.) 75 FR at 80420. In\nthe preamble to the NPRM, the Board\nreferred only to knowing noncompliance\nas evidence of unlawful motive. 75 FR\nat 80414-80415. On reflection, the\nBoard wishes to clarify this provision to\nstate that, to be considered as evidence\nof unlawful motive, an employer’s\nfailure to post the notice must be both\nknowing and willful—i.e., the employer\nmust have actual (as opposed to\nconstructive) knowledge of the rule and\nyet refuse, on no cognizable basis, to\npost the notice. The Board is revising\nthe language of the rule accordingly.\nThe comment that prompted these\nrevisions urges that there should be no\nadverse consequences for the employer\nthat does not post the notice because it\nhas a good-faith (but, implicitly,\nerroneous) belief that it is not covered\nby the NLRA.62 The Board rejects this\ncontention as it pertains to finding the\nfailure to post to be an unfair labor\npractice or grounds for tolling the 10(b)\nperiod. Failure to post the notice\ninterferes with employees’ NLRA rights\nregardless of the reason for the failure;\ngood faith, though commendable, is\nirrelevant.163 Additionally, tolling is\n\n162 One example could be an employer that\nbelieves that it is subject to the Railway Labor Act\nand not to the NLRA.\n\n163 This is so in other areas of NLRA law. For\nexample, an employer who coercively interrogates\nor disciplines an individual concerning his or her\nunion activities violates the NLRA if the individual\nis a statutory employee, even though the employer\nmay have honestly believed that the individual was\na statutory supervisor and not protected by the\nNLRA. Also, absent compelling economic\ncircumstances, an employer that is testing the\nBoard’s certification of a newly-selected union in\nthe court of appeals makes unilateral changes in\nunit employees’ terms and conditions of\nemployment at its peril; if the court affirms the\ncertification, the unilateral changes violate NLRA\nSection 8(a)(5) even if the employer believed in\ngood faith that the certification was inappropriate.\n\nconcerned with fairness to the\nemployee, and these fairness concerns\nare unaffected by the employer’s good or\nbad faith; as previously noted, notice\nposting tolling is fundamentally\ndifferent from tolling based upon\nemployer misconduct. However, an\nemployer that fails to post the notice\nonly because it honestly but erroneously\nbelieves that it is not subject to the\nNLRB’s jurisdiction does not thereby\nindicate that it is hostile to employees’\nNLRA rights, but only that it believes\nthat those rights do not apply in the\nemployer’s workplace. In such a case,\nthe employer’s good faith normally\nshould preclude finding the failure to\npost to be willful or evidence of\nantiunion animus.\n\nACC contends that even though the\ntule states that only a “willful” failure\nto post the notice may be considered\nevidence of unlawful motive, in practice\nthe Board will always infer at least\nconstructive notice from the publication\nof the rule in the Federal Register and\nthe maxim that “ignorance of the law is\nno excuse.” 164 The Board rejects this\ncontention. The quoted maxim means\nonly that an employer’s actual lack of\nknowledge of the rule would not excuse\nits failure to post the notice. It would,\nhowever, undercut any suggestion that\nthe failure to post was willful and\ntherefore indicative of unlawful motive.\n\nContrary to numerous comments,'®>\nfinding a willful failure to post the\nnotice as evidence of animus is not the\nsame as adopting a ‘‘presumption of\nanimus” or “‘presumption of unlawful\nmotive.” There is no such presumption.\nThe Board’s general counsel would have\nthe burden of proving that a failure to\npost was willful. In any event, a willful\nfailure to post would not be conclusive\nproof of unlawful motive, but merely\nevidence that could be considered,\nalong with other evidence, in\ndetermining whether the general\ncounsel had demonstrated unlawful\nmotive.166 Likewise, contrary to the\ncontentions of ALFA and AHCA, the\nBoard will not assume that any failure\n\nMike O’Connor Chevrolet, 209 NLRB 701, 703\n(1974), enf. denied on other grounds 512 F.2d 684\n(8th Cir. 1975).\n\n164 See also comment of American Health Care\nAssociation (AHCA).\n\n165 See, e.g., comments of FMI and COLLE.\n\n166 The Georgetown law students ask whether, if\nfailure to post the notice may be found to be an\nunfair labor practice and also may be considered\nevidence of antiunion animus, such a failure could\n“satisfy an element of its own violation.” The\nanswer is no, because the failure to post, whether\nknowing or inadvertent, would be an unfair labor\npractice regardless of motive; knowing and willful\nfailure to post would be relevant only in cases such\nas those alleging unlawful discipline, discharge, or\nrefusal to hire, in which motive is an element of the\nviolation.\n\nto post the notice is intentional and\nmeant to prevent employees of learning\ntheir rights.\n\nD. Other Comments\n\nThe Board received many comments\nasserting that if the proposed\nenforcement scheme for failure to post\nthe required notice is adopted, union\nadherents will tear down the notices in\norder to harass employers and,\nparticularly, to vitiate 10(b).167 These\ncomments express the concern that\ntolling the 10(b) period will lead to a\nflood of unfair labor practice charges,\nand that, to avoid that eventuality,\nemployers will have to incur significant\ncosts of policing the postings and/or\ninstalling expensive tamper-proof\nbulletin boards.168 In the absence of\nexperience with such postings, the\nBoard deems these concerns speculative\nat this time. If particular employers\nexperience such difficulties, the Board\nwill deal with them on a case-by-case\nbasis. However, as explained above,\ntolling is an equitable matter, and if an\nemployer has posted the notice and\ntaken reasonable steps to insure that it\nremains posted, it is unlikely that the\nBoard would find tolling appropriate.\n\nCalifornia Chamber and NCAE ask the\nBoard to specify the ‘‘additional\nremedies” that may be imposed in the\nevent of a notice posting violation.\n104.213(a). The Board has broad\ndiscretion in crafting remedies for\nviolations of the NLRA. NLHB v. Seven-\nUp Bottling Co. of Miami, 344 U.S. 344,\n346 (1953). The remedies imposed in a\ngiven case depend on the nature of the\nviolations and the particular facts in the\ncase. The Board declines to speculate as\nto every possible remedy that might be\nimposed in every imaginable set of\ncircumstances.\n\nSeveral comments protest that\nemployers could be fined for failing to\npost the notice; several others contend\nthat the Board should levy fines instead\nof imposing the proposed remedies. The\n\n167 See, e.g., comments of Lemon Grove Care &\nRehabilitation, numerous “‘postcard’’ comments.\n\n168 One comment asserts that because of the\npotential for tolling the 10(b) period, “businesses\n* * * will have to keep records forever[.]” The\nBoard finds no merit in this contention. Employers\nthat are aware of the rule can avoid keeping records\n“forever” simply by posting the notice. Employers\nthat are not aware of the requirement to post the\nnotice would also be unaware of the possibility of\ntolling the 10(b) period in the event of a failure to\npost, and thus would discern no reason to—and\nprobably would not—keep records “‘forever.”\nPrejudice to the employer because of long-lost\nrecords would be considered by the Board in\ndetermining whether tolling is appropriate in the\nparticular case.\n\nAnother comment complains that “the\nrequirement of proof on the employer to ‘certify’\nthat this posting is up each day is burdensome[.]”\nThere is no such requirement.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022307",
