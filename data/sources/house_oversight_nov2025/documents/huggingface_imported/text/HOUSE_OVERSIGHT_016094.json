  "text": "404 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nCreative Survival Advantaget — That creativity has evolved to\ngive us a survival advantage at all stages of evolution, not just when\nwe evolve to the point where mathematical intuition is significant.\n\n15. Free Will\nLaplace Daemon - A conceptual supreme being able to infer\nthe future and the past from one snapshot of space-time and the\nlaws of nature.\nEPR Paradox — Twin particles would transmit information\nfaster than the speed of light if quantum mechanics was to be\nbelieved.\nSchrédinger’s Cat — The paradox that a cat might be both alive\nand dead at the same time until observed.\nBell Inequality — Quantum mechanics forbids local hidden\nvariables in a testable way. The test succeeds.\nKochen-Specker Paradox — Particles cannot know their settings\nbefore measurement.\nFree Will Theorem — Nothing in the past light cone of the\nUniverse causes a particle to choose its spin upon measurement.\nNon-decryptable Universet — The laws of physics mean the\nUniverse is non-computable in principle.\nFree Will Universet - The laws of mathematics mean the\nUniverse is non-computable and therefore has Free Will.\nRussian Doll Conjecturet — Since humans are creative and\nnon-deterministic and, in a sense, they run upon the hardware\nof the Universe, the hardware of our Universe must also be non-\ndeterministic.\n\n16. The Quest for Knowledge\nTechnology Hypothesist — The extended strong anthropic\nprinciple that the Universe must have creative beings within it\nto uniquely define it.\n\n17. The Future\nCreative Non-Singularityt — The future is non-computable and\ntherefore any increase in computer power, however great, will\nnever achieve a creativity singularity.\n\n+ The symbol marks items proposed for the first time within this\n\nbook. If I have missed a previous publication, please feel free to\nwrite to me and I will amend a future version.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016094",
