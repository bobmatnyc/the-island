  "text": "/ BARAK / 54\n\nChapter Twenty-One\n\nPresident Clinton and I met the next morning. My aim was to persuade him that\nthe time had come for a make-or-break summit with Yasir Arafat.\n\nI suspected it would not be easy to convince him, and it wasn’t. But I made the\nargument that if we were to have any hope of moving Oslo forward, we now faced\na Stark choice. We were three years behind the timeline for starting work on a\n“permanent status” agreement, and only six months from an American election that\nwould choose President Clinton’s successor. We could, of course, pursue the Oslo\nprocess along its current, meandering path. But even though Bibi had slowed it\ndown, that would inevitably mean Israel handing back yet more West Bank land to\nArafat — in return for familiar, but still unfulfilled and untested, verbal assurances\nthat he wanted peace. Each successive Israeli withdrawal reduced his incentive to\nengage of the core issues like final borders, refugees, or Jerusalem. I could not in\ngood conscience justify that, either to myself or my country. The second option\nwas the summit. I realized there was no guarantee it would succeed. But it would\nfinally force Arafat to negotiate on the core issues — before the departure of an\nAmerican President who had a grasp of the all issues and characters involved, and\na personal commitment to converting the promise of Oslo into a genuine peace.\n\nThe obvious political risk, for both Clinton and me, was that after convening a\nsummit — with all the heightened expectations and pressures it would bring — we’d\nfail to get an agreement. Though I’d be more directly affected, however, it was a\nmore straightforward choice for me. In part because I’d been in front-line politics\nso briefly, but mostly because of what I’d done for the three-and-a-half decades\nbefore then, I viewed the political risk as just one of many, and by no means the\nmost important. That was an obvious weakness in me as a traditional politician. I\nwould indeed pay a political price later on for having given too little heed, and\nperhaps underestimated, the reaction in Israel to the summit and what came after it.\nYet as I tried to impress on President Clinton, there were risks in not holding a\nsummit as well, along with the obvious reward of a full and final peace if it\nsucceeded. If it failed? At least we would know a peace agreement with Arafat was\nimpossible. In fact, amid the diplomatic drift since Oslo, it was clear there was no\nother way that we could know.\n\n340\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011811",
