I visited and traveled with Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 through the summer of\n2002, and during that time I stayed with him, as his sex slave, at each of his houses (really more\nlike mansions) in locations including New York City, New York; the area of Santa Fe, New\nMexico; Palm Beach, Florida; an island in the U.S. Virgin Islands; and Paris, France. I had sex\nwith him often in these places and also with the various people he demanded that I have sex\nwith. Epstein paid me for many of these sexual encounters. In fact, my only purpose for\nEpstein, Maxwell and their friends was to be used for sex.\n\n16. To illustrate my connection to these places, I include four photographs taken of\nme in New Mexico (shown below). The first one is a museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico. We\nhad gone sightseeing for the day. Epstein took this picture of me. I was approximately 17 at the\ntime, judging from the looks of it. At the end of the day we returned to Epstein’s Zorro Ranch.\nThe second picture is me on one of Epstein’s horses on the ranch in New Mexico. The following\n\ntwo are from wintertime in New Mexico.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010895",
