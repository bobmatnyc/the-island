  "text": "dehumanization, and self-deception which each have both beneficial and toxic personalities, so too does\nglobalization. Globalization has integrated developing countries into the global economy and allowed\nthem to profit from new resources and advances. But globalization has also fragmented these countries\nby giving them access to resources that corrupt, such as arms for guerrilla leaders and rogue armies. What\nhas changed in the twenty-first century, perhaps as early as the 1990s, is a new form of war, one that is\ntied to the signature of evil and its expression as excessive harm. No longer are wars confined to state\nborders, restricted to states and their legitimized militaries, financed by governments and tax revenues,\nand focused on combatants. Instead, the new wars of the twenty-first century have entirely porous\nboundaries, are funded by private organizations, run by grass-root groups, and motivated by the use of\nhorrific means to achieve equally horrific ends, including torture, rape, mutilation, and the use and abuse\nof civilians, women, children and men alike. As a result, international law is effectively, ineffective.\nThose running these new wars are outside of international law.\n\nThe consequence of the new wars extends beyond the travesties experienced by those living in\nthese hot spots to the humanitarian aid workers and journalists who attempt to help the victims.\nHumanitarian aid is often pirated by rogue militias, and journalists are frequently killed or badly injured.\nWe must therefore face the sad reality that as we ended the twentieth-century and initiated the twenty-\nfirst, casualties to non-combatant civilians shifted from few to many. We must face the reality that\ncombating evil will require new laws and new protections for those who risk their lives to aid victims and\ngive voice to their often silent suffering.\n\nEvil ever after?\n\nWe won't eradicate evil. Why? Because the capacity for evil is rooted in human nature, born of a\npromiscuous mind that enables ideas and feelings to flip between beneficial and toxic. Though we\ninstitute programs and practices that promote the beneficial, living within every human mind is a toxic\nneighbor, waiting to move in. Adhering to authorities is beneficial in that great leaders are energizing,\nempowering, creative, and a source of guidance into a brighter future. But even great leaders can turn\ntoxic, imposing corrosive ideologies and eliminating basic human rights. Conformity is beneficial in that\nwe want to live in a society where norms are followed, providing stability and cooperation. But\nconformity is toxic when it leads to blind faith and uncritical thinking. Dehumanization is beneficial in\nallowing us to carry out medical procedures and live with certain kinds of human suffering. But\ndehumanization is toxic when it facilitates ethnic cleansing by shrinking the moral circle, turning\natrocities into virtuous offerings. Tolerance and pluralism are beneficial in that they lead to respect and\nconcern for others’ attitudes and desires. But tolerance and pluralism are toxic when they breed apathy\nand a willingness to stand by as passive bystanders.\n\nMy diagnosis of evil is not meant to be defeatist, but realist. It is only through an\nacknowledgment of our biology and the environments it has created — and can create — that we can look\nfor solutions to ameliorate the human condition. We are all vulnerable to walking on the wrong side. We\nare fallible. We are also enormously creative, capable of great change. Like no other species, we\nrelentlessly seek novelty. No one wants to be like his or her predecessor. Whether it is a new culinary\ntradition, extreme sport, technological innovation, musical genre, or weapon of destruction, our search for\nnovelty is an indestructible component of human nature.\n\nOur journey into the nature of evil has come to an end. Bombarded by the sheer magnitude of\nlives lost or damaged beyond repair, it is natural to deaden our senses and choke our feelings in the hope\nof finding solitude and peace. As painful as a re-awakening is, we must remember the individuals that\nmake up these massive atrocities. Reflecting upon the loss of his son who was murdered by the Lord's\nResistance Army, an 80 year old Ugandan chief summed it up— \"We have been forgotten. It’s as if we\ndon’t exist.\"\n\nWe must never forget. We must never deny our potential to cause horrific pain and suffering\nwhile finding ways to forgive and express deep compassion. We must never give up on humanity.\n\nHauser Epilogue. Evilightenment 150\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012896",
