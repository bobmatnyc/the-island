PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, these reports, that are\n4 loosely described as police reports, encompass a one-year\n5) purported investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department\n6 into the affairs of Mr. Epstein roughly beginning I think in\n7 2005 and going through 2006. The detective initially assigned\n8 to the case was a woman named Michelle Pagan, and then\n9 Detective Recarey took over the investigation from Ms. Pagan.\n1) There were a number of things, according to the reports --\nai although we don't really have any actual witness testimony,\n12 with current knowledge. The police did a number of things.\n13 They surveiled Epstein's house, they did trash pulls, and\n14 ultimately they executed a search warrant at Mr. Epstein's\n15 house. And that's sort of the totality of the investigation.\n16 I give you that as the backdrop, your Honor, because\nLy then next what seems to happen is very curious, in my\n18 experience, and was testified to by Detective Recarey. The\n19 police get crossways with the state attorney's office in\n20 Florida, and there is a complete distrust between the two\n21. agencies. As a result of that -- and there's a bunch of\n22 in-fighting that goes on between these two agencies. The\n23 police make the decision to, in some fashion, turn over\n24 everything that they have to the FBI. And as best I can figure\n25 it out, the FBI issued a grand jury subpoena, or the U.S.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011411",
