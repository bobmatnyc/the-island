This former CEO, coming from a business where there re-\nally is someone in charge, didn’t know what to do. He talked to people\nwho talked to people and eventually he found me.\n\nAs a professor for 30 some odd years, I developed a healthy disre-\nspect for professors as a group. They tend to lobby for keeping their\nlives easy and that means, among other things, making sure they\ndon’t have to teach too much or teach in a way that makes them have\nto work too hard. Professors always have something more important\nto do than teach. I am not criticizing here. I would have been the first\nto whine and wail if anyone had made me teach more than one course\nevery other quarter. I considered myself a researcher, also a graduate\nseminar teacher, but classes with lots of students wanting to hear a\nlecture? Ugh.\n\nThe college president and I had dinner and discussed what we\ncould do together. I said we could build any program he wanted online\nas long as we didn’t need the approval of faculty to do it and we had\ngood experts available. He said he was the expert and we needed the\napproval of no one. I said it would be expensive and he said, God will\nprovide. (Did I mention this school is run by the Christian Brothers?)\n\nTwo months later I found myself in front of 25 faculty in Barce-\nlona as I interviewed the president about what someone would have\nto know how to do in order to make them into someone whom he\nwould hire. He gave me a list. The faculty got to comment, but that\nwas about it. It was clear who was in charge.\n\nSo, we built a story-centered curriculum meant to teach practi-\ncal business by creating simulated experiences. The idea is to deliver\nit online around the world, using mentors who speak the students’\nlanguage. (The website is in English). No classes. No lectures. No tests.\nGraduates get an MBA degree but this curriculum doesn’t have that\nmuch in common with traditional MBA programs. The idea is to help\npeople launch their own business or go to work.\n\nStudents are part of teams that work to create deliverables within\na story about a situation that demands some work on their part. They\nconsult with their team members and use extensive background and\nstep-by-step help that has been created as part of the website. Men-\ntors are available to answer questions and to evaluate the final work\nproduct. The projects are large enough that students need to divide up\nthe work and consult with one another on how to proceed. Eventually\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023804",
