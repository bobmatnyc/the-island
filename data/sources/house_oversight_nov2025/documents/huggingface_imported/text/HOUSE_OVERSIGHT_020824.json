In it, we examine USA Inc.’s income\nstatement and balance sheet. We aim to interpret the underlying data and facts and illustrate\npatterns and trends in easy-to-understand ways. We analyze the drivers of federal revenue and\nthe history of expense growth, and we examine basic scenarios for how America might move\ntoward positive cash flow.\nThanks go out to Liang Wu and Fred Miller and former Morgan Stanley colleagues whose\ncontributions to this report were invaluable. In addition, Richard Ravitch, Emil Henry, Laura\nTyson, Al Gore, Meg Whitman, John Cogan, Peter Orszag and Chris Liddell provided inspiration\nand insights as the report developed. It includes a 2-page foreword; a 12-page text summary;\nand 460 PowerPoint slides containing data-rich observations. There’s a lot of material – think of\nit as a book that happens to be a slide presentation.\nWe hope the slides in particular provide relevant context for the debate about America’s\nfinancials.

Shultz, Paul Volcker, Michael Bloomberg, Richard Ravitch and John Doerr\nFebruary 2011\nOur country is in deep financial trouble. Federal, state and local governments are deep in debt\nyet continue to spend beyond their means, seemingly unable to stop. Our current path is simply\nunsustainable. What to do?\nA lot of people have offered suggestions and proposed solutions. Few follow the four key\nguideposts to success that we see for setting our country back on the right path:\n1) create a deep and widely held perception of the reality of the problem and the stakes involved;\n2) reassure citizens that there are practical solutions;\n3) develop support in key constituencies; and\n4) determine the right timing to deliver the solutions.\nUSA Inc. uses each of these guideposts, and more; it is full of ideas that can help us build a\nbetter future for our children and our country.\nFirst, Mary Meeker and her co-contributors describe America’s problems in an imaginative way\nthat should allow anyone to grasp them both intellectually and emotionally. By imagining the\nfederal government as a company, they provide a simple framework for understanding our\ncurrent situation. They show how deficits are piling up on our income statement as spending\noutstrips income and how our liabilities far exceed nominal assets on our balance sheet. USA\nInc. also considers additional assets – hard to value physical assets and our intangible wealth –\nour creativity and energy and our tradition of an open, competitive society.\nAdditionally, the report considers important trends, pointing specifically to an intolerable failure to\neducate many in the K-12 grades, despite our knowledge of how to do so. And all these\nimportant emotional arguments help drive a gut reaction to add to data provided to reinforce the\nintellectual reasons we already have.\nSecond, USA Inc. provides a productive way to think about solving our challenges. Once we\nhave created an emotional and intellectual connection to the problem, we want people to act and\ndrive the solution, not to throw up their hands in frustration. The authors’ ingenious indirect\napproach is to ask what a turnaround expert would do and what questions he or she would ask.\nThe report describes how we first stumbled into this mess, by failing to predict the magnitude of\nprogram costs, by creating perverse incentives for excessive behavior, and by missing important\ntrends. By pointing to the impact of individual responsibility, USA Inc. gives us reason to believe\nthat a practical solution exists and can be realized.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\niii\nThird, the report highlights how powerful bipartisan constituencies have emerged in the past to\ntackle great issues for the betterment of our nation, including tax reform, civil liberties,\nhealthcare, education and national defense. Just as presidents of both parties rose to the\noccasion to preside over the difficult process of containment during the half-century cold war, we\nknow we can still find leaders who are willing to step up and overcome political or philosophical\ndifferences for a good cause, even in these difficult times.\nFinally, the report makes an important contribution to the question of timing. Momentum will\nfollow once the process begins to gain support, and USA Inc. should help by stimulating broad\nrecognition and understanding of the challenges, by providing ways to think about solutions, and\nby helping constituencies of action to emerge. As the old saying goes, “If not now, when? If not\nus, who?”\nWith this pioneering report, we have a refreshing, business-minded approach to understanding\nand addressing our nation’s future. Read on…you may be surprised by how much you learn. We\nhope you will be motivated to help solve the problem!\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\niv\nTable of Contents\nAbout USA Inc. ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ii\nForeword ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ iii\nSummary ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ vii\nIntroduction ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 5\nHigh-Level Thoughts on Income Statement/Balance Sheet ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 25\nIncome Statement Drilldown ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 53\nEntitlement Spending ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 72\nMedicaid ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 94\nMedicare ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 100\nUnemployment Benefits ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 121\nSocial Security ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 129\nRising Debt Level and Interest Payments ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 142\nDebt Level ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 145\nEffective Interest Rates ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 161\nDebt Composition ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 168\nPeriodic Large One-Time Charges ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 177\nTARP ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 188\nFannie Mae / Freddie Mac ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 193\nARRA ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 200\nBalance Sheet Drilldown ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 209\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nv\nWhat Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 221\nHigh-Level Thoughts on How to Turn Around USA Inc.’s Financial Outlook ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 237\nFocus on Expenses ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 253\nReform Entitlement Programs ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 255\nRestructure Social Security ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 256\nRestructure Medicare & Medicaid ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 268\nFocus on Operating Efficiency ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 329\nReview Wages & Benefits ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 335\nReview Government Pension Plans ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 338\nReview Role of Unions ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 342\nReview Cost Structure & Headcount ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 345\nReview Non-Core 'Business' for Out-Sourcing ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 349\nFocus on Revenues ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 355\nDrive Sustainable Economic Growth ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 356\nInvest in Technology / Infrastructure / Education ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 366\nIncrease / Improve Employment ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 383\nImprove Competitiveness ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 389\nConsider Changing Tax Policies ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 395\nReview Tax Rates ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 396\nReduce Subsidies / Tax Expenditures / Broaden Tax Base ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 400\nConsequences of Inaction ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 413\nShort-Term, Long-Term ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 415\nPublic Debt, Net Worth vs. Peers ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 416\nLessons Learned From Historical Debt Crisis ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 422\nGeneral Motors ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 431\nSummary ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 437\nAppendix ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ 453\nGlossary ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ xix\nIndex\n∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ xxvii\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nvi\nSummary\nImagine for a moment that the United States government is a public corporation. Imagine\nthat its management structure, fiscal performance, and budget are all up for review. Now\nimagine that you’re a shareholder in USA Inc. How do you feel about your investment?\nBecause 45% of us own shares in publicly traded companies, nearly half the country expects\nquarterly updates on our investments. But although 100% of us are stakeholders in the United\nStates, very few of us look closely at Washington’s financials. If we were long-term investors,\nhow would we evaluate the federal government’s business model, strategic plans, and operating\nefficiency? How would we react to its earnings reports? Nearly two-thirds of all American\nhouseholds pay federal income taxes, but very few of us take the time to dig into the numbers of\nthe entity that, on average, collects 13% of our annual gross income (not counting another 15-\n30% for payroll and various state and local taxes).\nWe believe it’s especially important to pay closer attention to one of our most important\ninvestments.\nAs American citizens and taxpayers, we care about the future of our country. As investors, we’re\nin an on-going search for data and insights that will help us make more informed investment\ndecisions. It’s easier to predict the future if one has a keen understanding of the past, but we\nfound ourselves struggling to find good information about America’s financials. So we decided to\nassemble – in one place and in a user-friendly format – some of the best data about the world’s\nbiggest “business.” We also provide some historical context for how USA Inc.’s financial model\nhas evolved over decades. And, as investors, we look at trend lines which help us understand\nthe patterns (and often future directions) of key financial drivers like revenue and expenses.\nThe complexity of USA Inc.’s challenges is well known, and our presentation is just a starting\npoint; it’s far from perfect or complete. But we are convinced that citizens – and investors –\nshould understand the business of their government. Thomas Jefferson and Alexis de\nTocqueville knew that – armed with the right information – the enlightened citizenry of America\nwould make the right decisions. It is our humble hope that a transparent financial framework can\nhelp inform future debates.\nIn the conviction that every citizen should understand the finances of USA Inc. and the plans of\nits “management team,” we examine USA Inc.’s income statement and balance sheet and\npresent them in a basic, easy-to-use format. We summarize our thoughts in PowerPoint form and\nin this brief text summary at www.kpcb.com/usainc. We encourage people to take our data and\nthoughts and study them, critique them, augment them, share them, and make them better.\nThere’s a lot of material – think of it as a book that happens to be a slide presentation.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nvii\nThere are two caveats. First, we do not make policy recommendations. We try to help clarify\nsome of the issues in a straightforward, analytical way. We aim to present data, trends, and facts\nabout USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers to provide context for how its financials have\nreached their present state. Our observations come from publicly available information, and we\nuse the tools of basic financial analysis to interpret it. Forecasts generally come from 3rd-party\nagencies like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan federal agency charged\nwith reviewing the financial impact of legislation. Second, the ‘devil is in the details.’ For US\npolicy makers, the timing of material changes will be especially difficult, given the current\neconomic environment.\nBy the standards of any public corporation, USA Inc.’s financials are discouraging.\nTrue, USA Inc. has many fundamental strengths. On an operating basis (excluding Medicare\nand Medicaid spending and one-time charges), the federal government’s profit & loss statement\nis solid, with a 4% median net margin over the last 15 years. But cash flow is deep in the red (by\nalmost $1.3 trillion last year, or -$11,000 per household), and USA Inc.’s net worth is negative\nand deteriorating. That net worth figure includes the present value of unfunded entitlement\nliabilities but not hard-to-value assets such as natural resources, the power to tax or mint\ncurrency, or what Treasury calls “heritage” or “stewardship assets” like national parks.\nNevertheless, the trends are clear, and critical warning signs are evident in nearly every data\npoint we examine.\nF2010 Cash Flow = -$1.3 Trillion; Net Worth = -$44 Trillion\nWith a Negative Trend Line Over Past 15 Years\nUSA Inc.

Here we estimated the net present value of future Medicaid spending through 2085E, assuming a\n3% discount rate. Data source: Dept. of Treasury, Dept. of Health & Human Services Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\nUSA Inc. | Summary\nSome consider defense outlays – which have nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP –\na principal cause of USA Inc.’s financial dilemma. But defense spending is still below its 7%\nshare of GDP from 1948 to 2000; it accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, compared with\n41% of all government spending between 1789 and 1930. The principal challenges lie\nelsewhere. Since the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with\nthe best of intentions, created various entitlement programs. They serve many of the nation’s\npoorest, whose struggles have been made worse by the recent financial crisis. Apart from Social\nSecurity and unemployment insurance, however, funding for these programs has been woefully\ninadequate – and getting worse.\nEntitlement expenses amount to $16,000 per household per year, and entitlement spending far\noutstrips funding, by more than $1 trillion (or $9,000 per household) in 2010. More than 35% of\nthe US population receives entitlement dollars or is on the government payroll, up from ~20% in\n1966. Given the high correlation of rising entitlement income with declining savings, do\nAmericans feel less compelled to save if they depend on the government for their future savings?\nIt is interesting to note that in China the household savings rate is ~36%, per our estimates\nbased on CEIC data, in part due to a higher degree of self-reliance – and far fewer established\npension plans. In the USA, the personal savings rate (defined as savings as percent of\ndisposable income) was 6% in 2010 and only 3% from 2000 to 2008.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nix\nMillions of Americans have come to rely on Medicare and Medicaid – and spending has\nskyrocketed, to 21% of USA Inc.’s total expenses (or $724B) in F2010, up from 5% forty\nyears ago.\nTogether, Medicaid and Medicare – the programs providing health insurance to low-income\nhouseholds and the elderly, respectively – now account for 35% of total healthcare spending in\nthe USA. Since their creation in 1965, both programs have expanded markedly. Medicaid now\nserves 16% of all Americans, compared with 2% at its inception; Medicare now serves 15% of\nthe population, up from 10% in 1966. As more Americans receive benefits and as healthcare\ncosts continue to outstrip GDP growth, total spending for the two entitlement programs is\naccelerating. Over the last decade alone, Medicaid spending has doubled in real terms, with\ntotal program costs running at $273 billion in F2010. Over the last 43 years, real Medicare\nspending per beneficiary has risen 25 times, driving program costs well (10x) above original\nprojections. In fact, Medicare spending exceeded related revenues by $272 billion last year.\nAmid the rancor about government’s role in healthcare spending, one fact is undeniable:\ngovernment spending on healthcare now consumes 8.2% of GDP, compared with just\n1.3% fifty years ago.\nTotal Government* Healthcare Spending Increases are Staggering –\nUp 7x as % of GDP Over Five Decades vs. Education Spending Only Up 0.6x\n8%\nUSA Total Government Healthcare vs. Education Spending as % of GDP, 1960 – 2009\n8.2%\nSpending as % of GDP\n6%\n4%\n2%\n1.2%\nTotal Government (Federal + State + Local) Spending on Healthcare\nTotal Government (Federal + State + Local) Spending on Education\n0%\n1960 1964 1968 1972 1976 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: *Total government spending on healthcare includes Medicare, Medicaid and other programs such as federal\nemployee and veteran health benefits; total government spending on education includes spending on pre-primary through\ntertiary education programs. Source: Dept. of Education, Dept. of Health & Human Services.\nUSA Inc. | Summary\nThe overall healthcare funding mix in the US is skewed toward private health insurance due to\nthe predominance of employer-sponsored funding (which covers 157MM working Americans and\ntheir families, or 58% of the total population in 2008 vs. 64% in 1999). This mixed private-public\nfunding scheme has resulted in implicit cross-subsidies, whereby healthcare providers push\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nx\ncosts onto the private market to help subsidize lower payments from public programs. This\ntends to help drive a cycle of higher private market costs causing higher insurance premiums,\nleading to the slow erosion of private market coverage and a greater enrollment burden for\ngovernment programs.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted in early 2010, includes the biggest\nchanges to healthcare since 1965 and will eventually expand health insurance coverage by\n~10%, to 32 million new lives. Increased access likely means higher spending if healthcare\ncosts continue to grow 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have over the\npast 40 years). The CBO sees a potential $143B reduction in the deficit over the next 10 years,\nbut this assumes that growth in Medicare costs will slow – an assumption the CBO admits is\nhighly uncertain.\nUnemployment Insurance and Social Security are adequately funded...for now. Their\nfuture, unfortunately, isn’t so clear.\nUnemployment Insurance is cyclical and, apart from the 2007-09 recession, generally operates\nwith a surplus. Payroll taxes kept Social Security mainly at break-even until 1975-81 when\nexpenses began to exceed revenue. Reforms that cut average benefits by 5%, raised tax rates\nby 2.3%, and increased the full retirement age by 3% (to 67) restored the system’s stability for\nthe next 25 years, but the demographic outlook is poor for its pay-as-you-go funding structure. In\n1950, 100 workers supported six beneficiaries; today, 100 workers support 33 beneficiaries.\nSince Social Security began in 1935, American life expectancy has risen 26% (to 78), but the\n“retirement age” for full benefits has increased only 3%.\nRegardless of the emotional debate about entitlements, fiscal reality can’t be ignored – if\nthese programs aren’t reformed, one way or another, USA Inc.’s balance sheet will go\nfrom bad to worse.\nFederal Government Spending Had Risen to 24% of GDP in 2010,\nUp From an Average of 3% From 1790 to 1930\nFederal Government Spending as % of GDP, 1790 – 2010\n40%\n35%\nFederal Spending as % of GDP\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n3% Trendline Average\n1790-1930\n24% in 2010\n5%\n0%\n1790 1810 1830 1850 1870 1890 1910 1930 1950 1970 1990 2010\nwww.kpcb.com\nSource: Federal spending per Series Y 457-465 in \"Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, Part II“ and per\nWhite House OMB.

From 1790 to 1930, government spending on average\naccounted for just 3% of American GDP. Today, government spending absorbs closer to 24% of\nGDP.\nIt’s likely that they would be even more surprised by the debt we have taken on to pay for this\nexpansion. As a percentage of GDP, the federal government’s public debt has doubled over the\nlast 30 years, to 53% of GDP. This figure does not include claims on future resources from\nunderfunded entitlements and potential liabilities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the\nGovernment Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). If it did include these claims, gross federal debt\naccounted for 94% of GDP in 2010. The public debt to GDP ratio is likely to triple to 146% over\nthe next 20 years, per CBO. The main reason is entitlement expense. Since 1970, these costs\nhave grown 5.5 times faster than GDP, while revenues have lagged, especially corporate tax\nrevenues. By 2037, cumulative deficits from Social Security could add another $11.6 trillion to\nthe public debt.\nThe problem gets worse. Even as USA Inc.’s debt has been rising for decades, plunging interest\nrates have kept the cost of supporting it relatively steady. Last year’s interest bill would have\nbeen 155% (or $290 billion) higher if rates had been at their 30-year average of 6% (vs. 2% in\n2010). As debt levels rise and interest rates normalize, net interest payments could grow 20% or\nmore annually. Below-average debt maturities in recent years have also kept the Treasury’s\nborrowing costs down, but this trend, too, will drive up interest payments once interest rates rise.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nxii\nCan we afford to wait until the turning point comes? By 2025, entitlements plus net\ninterest payments will absorb all – yes, all – of USA Inc.'s revenue, per CBO.\nEntitlement Spending + Interest Payments Alone Should\nExceed USA Inc.

Note that entitlement spending includes federal government expenditures on Social\nSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid. Data in our chart is based on CBO’s ‘alternative fiscal scenario’ forecast, which assumes a continuation of today’s underlying\nfiscal policy. Note that CBO also maintains an ‘extended-baseline’ scenario, which adheres closely to current law. The alternative fiscal scenario deviates from\nCBO’s baseline because it incorporates some policy changes that are widely expected to occur (such as extending the 2001-2003 tax cuts rather than letting them\nexpire as scheduled by current law and adjusting physician payment rates to be in line with the Medicare economic index rather than at lower scheduled rates) and\nthat policymakers have regularly made in the past.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Summary\nLess than 15 years from now, in other words, USA Inc. – based on current forecasts for revenue\nand expenses - would have nothing left over to spend on defense, education, infrastructure, and\nR&D, which today account for only 32% of USA Inc. spending, down from 69% forty years ago.\nThis critical juncture is getting ever closer. Just ten years ago, the CBO thought federal revenue\nwould support entitlement spending and interest payments until 2060 – 35 years beyond its\ncurrent projection. This dramatic forecast change over the past ten years helps illustrate, in our\nview, how important it is to focus on the here-and-now trend lines and take actions based on\nthose trends.\nHow would a turnaround expert determine ‘normal’ revenue and expenses?\nThe first step would be to examine the main drivers of revenue and expenses. It’s not a pretty\npicture. While revenue – mainly taxes on individual and corporate income – is highly correlated\n(83%) with GDP growth, expenses – mostly entitlement spending – are less correlated (73%)\nwith GDP. With that as backdrop, our turnaround expert might try to help management and\nshareholders (citizens) achieve a long-term balance by determining “normal” levels of revenue\nand expenses:\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nxiii\n• From 1965 to 2005 (a period chosen to exclude abnormal trends related to the recent\nrecession), annual revenue growth (3%) has been roughly in line with GDP growth, but\ncorporate income taxes have grown 2% a year. Social insurance taxes grew 5% annually and\nrepresented 37% of USA Inc. revenue, compared with 19% in 1965. An expert might ask:\no What level of social insurance or entitlement taxes can USA Inc. support without reducing\njob creation?\no Are low corporate income taxes important to global competitive advantage and stimulating\ngrowth?\n• Entitlement spending has risen 5% a year on average since 1965, well above average annual\nGDP growth of 3%, and now absorbs 51% of all expenses, more than twice its share in 1965.\nDefense and non-defense discretionary spending (including infrastructure, education, and law\nenforcement) is up just 1-2% annually over that period. Questions for shareholders:\no Do USA Inc.’s operations run at maximum efficiency? Where are the opportunities for cost\nsavings?\no Should all expense categories be benchmarked against GDP growth? Should some grow\nfaster or slower than GDP? If so, what are the key determinants?\no Would greater investment in infrastructure, education, and global competitiveness yield\nmore long-term security for the elderly and disadvantaged?\nWith expenses outstripping revenues by a large (and growing) margin, a turnaround expert\nwould develop an analytical framework for readjusting USA Inc.’s business model and strategic\nplans. Prudence would dictate that our expert assume below-trend GDP growth and above-trend\nunemployment, plus rising interest rates – all of which would make the base case operating\nscenario fairly gloomy.\nThis analysis can’t ignore our dependence on entitlements. Almost one-third of all\nAmericans have grown up in an environment of lean savings and heavy reliance on\ngovernment healthcare subsidies. It’s not just a question of numbers – it’s a question of\nour responsibilities as citizens…and what kind of society we want to be.\nSome 90 million Americans (out of a total population of 307 million) have grown accustomed to\nsupport from entitlement programs; so, too, have 14 million workers in the healthcare industry\nwho, directly or indirectly, benefit from government subsidies via Medicare and Medicaid. Low\npersonal savings and high unemployment make radical change difficult. Political will can be\ndifficult to summon, especially during election campaigns.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nxiv\nAt the same time, however, these numbers don’t lie. With our demographics and our\ndebts, we’re on a collision course with the future. The good news: Although time is\ngrowing short, we still have the capacity to create positive outcomes.\nEven though USA Inc. can print money and raise taxes, USA Inc. cannot sustain its financial\nimbalance indefinitely – especially as the Baby Boomer generation nears retirement age. Net\ndebt levels are approaching warning levels, and some polls suggest that Americans consider\nreducing debt a national priority. Change is legally possible. Unlike underfunded pension\nliabilities that can bankrupt companies, USA Inc.’s underfunded liabilities are not legal contracts.\nCongress has the authority to change the level and conditions for Social Security and Medicare\nbenefits; the federal government, together with the states, can also alter eligibility and benefit\nlevels for Medicaid.\nOptions for entitlement reform, operating efficiency, and stronger long-term GDP growth.\nAs analysts, not public policy experts, we can offer mathematical illustrations as a framework for\ndiscussion (not necessarily as actual solutions). We also present policy options from third-party\norganizations such as the CBO.\nReforming entitlement programs – Social Security.\nThe underfunding could be addressed through some or all of the following mechanical changes:\nincreasing the full retirement age to as high as 73 (from the current level of 67); and/or reducing\naverage annual social security benefits by up to 12% (from $13,010 to $11,489); and/or\nincreasing the social security tax rate from 12.4% to 14.2%. Options proposed by the CBO\ninclude similar measures, as well as adjustments to initial benefits and index levels. Of course,\nthe low personal savings rates of average Americans – 3% of disposable income, compared with\na 10% average from 1965 to 1985 – limit flexibility, at least in the early years of any reform.\nReforming entitlement programs – Medicare and Medicaid.\nMathematical illustrations for these programs, the most underfunded, seem draconian: Reducing\naverage Medicare benefits by 53%, to $5,588 per year, or increasing the Medicare tax rate by\n3.9 percentage points, to 6.8%, or some combination of these changes would address the\nunderfunding of Medicare. As for Medicaid, the lack of a dedicated funding stream (i.e., a tax\nsimilar to the Medicare payroll tax) makes the math even more difficult. But by one measure\nfrom the Kaiser Family Foundation, 60% of the Medicaid budget in 2001 was spent on so-called\noptional recipients (such as mid- to low-income population above poverty level) or on optional\nservices (such as dental services and prescription drug benefits). Reducing or controlling these\nbenefits could help control Medicaid spending – but increase the burden on some poor and\ndisabled groups.\nUltimately, the primary issue facing the US healthcare system is ever-rising costs, historically\ndriven by increases in price and utilization. Beneath sustained medical cost inflation is an\nentitlement mentality bolted onto a volume-based reimbursement scheme. All else being equal,\nthe outcome is an incentive to spend: Underlying societal, financial, and liability factors combine\nto fuel an inefficient, expensive healthcare system.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nxv\nImproving operating efficiency.\nWith nearly one government civilian worker (federal, state and local) for every six households,\nefficiency gains seem possible. A 20-year trend line of declining federal civilian headcount was\nreversed in the late 1990s.\nResuming that trend would imply a 15% potential headcount reduction over five years and save\nnearly $300 billion over the next ten years. USA Inc. could also focus intensively on local private\ncompany outsourcing, where state and local governments are finding real productivity gains.\nImproving long-term GDP growth – productivity and employment.\nFundamentally, federal revenues depend on GDP growth and related tax levies on consumers\nand businesses. Higher GDP growth won’t be easy to achieve as households rebuild savings in\nthe aftermath of a recession. To break even without changing expense levels or tax policies,\nUSA Inc. would need real GDP growth of 6-7% in F2012-14 and 4-5% in F2015-20, according to\nour estimates based on CBO data – highly unlikely, given 40-year average GDP growth of 3%.\nWhile USA Inc. could temporarily increase government spending and investment to make up for\nlower private demand in the near term, the country needs policies that foster productivity and\nemployment gains for sustainable long-term economic growth.\nHow Much Would Real GDP Need to Grow to Drive USA Inc. to Break-Even\nWithout Policy Changes? 6-7% in F2012E-F2014E & 4-5% in F2015-\nF2020E…Well Above 40-Year Average of 3%\n8%\nCBO’s Baseline Real GDP Growth vs. Required Real GDP\nGrowth for a Balanced Budget Between F2011E and F2020E\n6%\nReal GDP Y/Y Growth (%)\n4%\n2%\n0%\n2009 2011E 2013E 2015E 2017E 2019E\n-2%\n-4%\nReal GDP Annual Growth (CBO Baseline Forecast)\nReal GDP Annual Growth Needed to Eliminate Fiscal Deficit\n1970-2009 Average Real GDP Growth\nwww.kpcb.com\nSource: CBO, “The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2010 to 2020,” 8/10.\nUSA Inc. | Summary\nProductivity gains and increased employment each contributed roughly half of the long-term\nGDP growth between 1970 and 2009, per the National Bureau of Economic Research. Since the\n1960s, as more resources have gone to entitlements and interest payments, USA Inc. has\nscaled back its investment in technology R&D and infrastructure as percentages of GDP.\nCompetitors are making these investments. India plans to double infrastructure spending as a\npercent of GDP by 2013, and its tertiary (college) educated population will double over the next\nten years, according to Morgan Stanley analysts, enabling its GDP growth to accelerate to 9-\n10% annually by 2015 (China’s annual GDP growth is forecast to remain near 8% by 2015).\nUSA Inc. can’t match India’s demographic advantage, but technology can help.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nxvi\nFor employment gains, USA Inc. should minimize tax and regulatory uncertainties and\nencourage businesses to add workers. While hiring and R&D-related tax credits may add to\nnear-term deficits, over time, they should drive job and GDP growth. Immigration reform could\nalso help: A Federal Reserve study in 2010 shows that immigration does not take jobs from\nU.S.-born workers but boosts productivity and income per worker.\nChanging tax policies.\nUsing another simple mechanical illustration, covering the 2010 budget deficit (excluding onetime\ncharges) by taxes alone would mean doubling individual income tax rates across the board,\nto roughly 26-30% of gross income, we estimate. Such major tax increases would ultimately be\nself-defeating if they reduce private income and consumption. However, reducing tax\nexpenditures and subsidies such as mortgage interest deductions would broaden the tax base\nand net up to $1.7 trillion in additional revenue over the next decade, per CBO. A tax based on\nconsumption - like a value added tax (VAT) - could also redirect the economy toward savings\nand investment, though there would be drawbacks.\nThese issues are undoubtedly complex, and difficult decisions must be made. But\ninaction may be the greatest risk of all. The time to act is now, and our first responsibility\nas investors in USA Inc. is to understand the task at hand.\nOur review finds serious challenges in USA Inc.’s financials. The ‘management team’ has\ncreated incentives to spend on healthcare, housing, and current consumption. At the margin,\ninvesting in productive capital, education, and technology – the very tools needed to compete in\nthe global marketplace – has stagnated.\nAmerica’s Resources Allocated to Housing + Healthcare Nearly Doubled as a Percent\nof GDP Since 1965, While Household and Government Savings Fell Dramatically\n25%\n20%\nHealthcare + Housing Spending vs. Net Household +\nGovernment Savings as % of GDP, 1965-2009\nHousing + Healthcare Spending as % of GDP\nNet Household + Government Savings as % of GDP\n20%\nAs % of GDP\n15%\n10%\n5%\n11%\n7%\n0%\n1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005\n-5%\n-10%\n-9%\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: Housing includes purchase, rent and home improvement.

The sovereign credit issues in\nEurope suggest what might lie ahead for USA Inc. shareholders – and our children. In effect,\nUSA Inc. is maxing out its credit card. It has fallen into a pattern of spending more than it earns\nand is issuing debt at nearly every turn. Common principles for overcoming this kind of burden\ninclude the following:\n1) Acknowledge the problem – some 80% of Americans believe ‘dealing with our growing\nbudget deficit and national debt’ is a national priority, according to a Peter G. Peterson\nFoundation survey in 11/09;\n2) Examine past errors – People need clear descriptions and analysis to understand how the\nUS arrived at its current financial condition – a ‘turnaround CEO’ would certainly initiate a\n‘no holds barred’ analysis of the purpose, success and operating efficiency of all of USA\nInc.’s spending;\n3) Make amends for past errors – Most Americans today at least acknowledge the problems\nat personal levels and say they rarely or never spend more than what they can afford (63%\naccording to a 2007 Pew Research study). The average American knows the importance\nof managing a budget. Perhaps more would be willing to sacrifice for the greater good with\nan understandable plan to serve the country’s long-term best interests;\n4) Develop a new code of behavior – Policymakers, businesses (including investment firms),\nand citizens need to share responsibility for past failures and develop a plan for future\nsuccesses.\nPast generations of Americans have responded to major challenges with collective\nsacrifice and hard work.

It should manage its operations\nand programs as effectively and efficiently as possible, improve its financial\nposition by driving the federal government’s income statement to long-term\nbreak-even, and reduce the unsustainable level of debt on its balance sheet.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n7\nUSA Inc. Concept\nHealthy financials and compelling growth prospects are key to success for businesses\n(and countries). So if the US federal government – which we call USA Inc. – were a\nbusiness, how would public shareholders view it? How would long-term investors evaluate\nthe federal government’s business model, strategic plans, and operating efficiency? How\nwould analysts react to its earnings reports? Although some 45% 1 of American households\nown shares in publicly traded companies and receive related quarterly financial statements, not\nmany “stakeholders” look closely at Washington’s financials. Nearly two-thirds of all American\nhouseholds 2 pay federal income taxes, but very few take the time to dig into the numbers of the\nentity that, on average, collects 13% 3 of all Americans’ annual gross income (not counting\nanother 15-30% for payroll and various state and local taxes).\nWe drill down on USA Inc.’s past, present, and (in some cases) future financial dynamics and\nfocus on the country’s income statement and balance sheet and related trends. We isolate and\nreview key expense and revenue drivers. On the expense side, we examine the major\nentitlement programs (Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) as well as defense and other\nmajor discretionary programs. On the revenue side, we focus on GDP growth (driven by labor\nproductivity and employment in the long run) and tax policies.\nWe present basic numbers-driven scenarios for addressing USA Inc.'s financial challenges. In\naddition, we lay out the type of basic checklists that corporate turnaround experts might use as\nstarting points when looking at some of USA Inc.’s business model challenges.\nSource: 1) 2008 ICI (Investment Company Institute) / SIFMA (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association) Equity\nand Bond Owners Survey; 2) Number of tax returns with positive tax liability (91MM) divided by total number of returns filed (142MM), per Tax Foundation\ncalculations based on IRS data; 3) Total federal income taxes (ex. payroll taxes) paid divided by total adjusted gross income, per IRS 2007 data.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n8\nWhy We Wrote This Report\nAs American citizens / tax payers, we care about the future of our country.\nAs investors, we search for data and insights to help us make better\ninvestment decisions. (It’s easier to predict the future with a keen\nunderstanding of the past.)\nWe found ourselves searching for better information about the state of America’s\nfinancials, and we decided to assemble – in one place and in a user-friendly format\n– some of the best data about the world’s biggest “business.” In addition, we have\nattempted to provide some historical context for how USA Inc.’s financial model has\nevolved over decades.\nThe complexity of USA Inc.’s challenges is well known, and our presentation is just\na starting point; it’s far from perfect or complete. But we are convinced that citizens\n– and investors – should understand the business of their government. Thomas\nJefferson and Alexis de Tocqueville knew that – armed with the right information –\nthe enlightened citizenry of America would make the right decisions. It is our\nhumble hope that a transparent financial framework can help inform future debates.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n9\nWhat You’ll Find Here…\nIn the conviction that every citizen should understand the finances of\nUSA Inc. and the plans of its “management team,” we examine USA Inc.’s\nincome statement and balance sheet and present them in a basic, easy-touse\nformat.\nIn this document, a broad group of people helped us drill into our federal\ngovernment’s basic financial metrics. We summarize our thoughts in PowerPoint\nform here and also have provided a brief text summary at www.kpcb.com/usainc.\nWe encourage people to take our data and thoughts and study them, critique them,\naugment them, share them, and make them better. There’s a lot of material – think\nof it as a book that happens to be a slide presentation.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n10\n…And What You Won’t\nWe do not make policy recommendations. We try to help clarify some of the\nissues in a simple, analytically-based way. We aim to present data, trends, and\nfacts about USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers to provide context for\nhow its financials have reached their present state.\nWe did not base this analysis on proprietary data. Our observations come\nfrom publicly available information, and we use the tools of basic financial\nanalysis to interpret it. Forecasts generally come from 3rd-party agencies like the\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO). For US policy makers, the timing of material\nchanges will be especially difficult, given the current economic environment.\nNo doubt, there will be compliments and criticism of things in the\npresentation (or missing from it). We hope that this report helps advance the\ndiscussion and we welcome others to opine with views (backed up by data).\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n11\nWe Focus on Federal,\nNot State & Local Government Data\n� Federal / State & Local Governments Share Different Responsibilities\n� Federal government is financially responsible for all or the majority of Defense, Social\nSecurity, Medicare and Interest Payments on federal debt and coordinates / shares\nfunding for public investment in education / infrastructure.\n� State & local governments are financially responsible for all or the majority of Education,\nTransportation (Road Construction & Maintenance), Public Safety (Police / Fire\nProtection / Law Courts / Prisons) and Environment & Housing (Parks & Recreation /\nCommunity Development / Sewerage & Waste Management).\n� Federal / state & local governments share financial responsibility in Medicaid and\nUnemployment Insurance.\n� We Focus on the Federal Government\n� State and local governments face many similar long-term financial challenges and may\nultimately require federal assistance. To be sure, the size of state & local government\nbudget deficits ($70 billion 1 in aggregate in F2009) and debt-to-GDP ratio (7% 2 on\naverage in F2008) pales by comparison to the federal government’s ($1.3 trillion budget\ndeficit, 62% debt-to-GDP ratio in F2010). But these metrics may understate state & local\ngovernments’ financial challenges by 50% or more 3 because they exclude the long-term\ncost of public pension and other post employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities.\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: 1) Per National Conference of State Legislatures, State fiscal years ends in June. $70B aggregate excludes deficits\nfrom Puerto Rico ($3B deficits in F2009). 2) Debt-to-GDP ratio per Census Bureau State & Local Government Finance; 3)\nCalculation based on the claim that $1T of collective short fall in State & local government pension and OPEB funding\nwould be $2.5T using corporate accounting rules, per Orin S. Kramer, “How to Cheat a Retirement Fund,” 9/10.\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n12\n�Summary\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n13\nHighlights from F2010 USA Inc. Financials\n� Summary – USA Inc. has challenges.\n� Cash Flow – While recession depressed F2008-F2010 results, cash flow has been negative\nfor 9 consecutive years ($4.8 trillion, cumulative), with no end to losses in sight. Negative\ncash flow implies that USA Inc. can't afford the services it is providing to 'customers,' many\nof whom are people with few alternatives.\n� Balance Sheet – Net worth is negative and deteriorating.\n� Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities – Off-balance sheet liabilities of at least $31 trillion (primarily\nunfunded Medicare and Social Security obligations) amount to nearly $3 for every $1 of debt\non the books. Just as unfunded corporate pensions and other post-employment benefits\n(OPEB) weigh on public corporations, unfunded entitlements, over time, may increase USA\nInc.’s cost of capital. And today’s off-balance sheet liabilities will be tomorrow’s on-balance\nsheet debt.\n� Conclusion – Publicly traded companies with similar financial trends would be pressed by\nshareholders to pursue a turnaround. The good news: USA Inc.’s underlying asset base and\nentrepreneurial culture are strong. The financial trends can shift toward a positive direction,\nbut both ‘management’ and ‘shareholders’ will need collective focus, willpower, commitment,\nand sacrifice.\nNote: USA federal fiscal year ends in September; Cash flow = total revenue – total spending on a cash basis; net worth includes\nunfunded future liabilities from Social Security and Medicare on an accrual basis over the next 75 years.

Financials…\n� To analysts looking at USA Inc. as a public corporation, the financials are challenged\n�\nExcluding Medicare / Medicaid spending and one-time charges, USA Inc. has supported a 4% average net\nmargin 1 over 15 years, but cash flow is deep in the red by negative $1.3 trillion last year (or\n-$11,000 per household), and net worth 2 is negative $44 trillion (or -$371,000 per household).\n� The main culprits: entitlement programs, mounting debt, and one-time charges\n�\n�\n�\nSince the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with the best of intentions,\ncreated various entitlement programs. Some of these serve the nation’s poorest, whose struggles have\nbeen made worse by the financial crisis. Apart from Social Security and unemployment insurance,\nhowever, funding for these programs has been woefully inadequate – and getting worse.\nEntitlement expenses (adjusted for inflation) rose 70% over the last 15 years, and USA Inc. entitlement\nspending now equals $16,600 per household per year; annual spending exceeds dedicated funding by\nmore than $1 trillion (and rising). Net debt levels are approaching warning levels, and one-time charges\nonly compound the problem.\nSome consider defense spending a major cause of USA Inc.’s financial dilemma. Re-setting priorities and\nstreamlining could yield savings – $788 billion by 2018, according to one recent study 3 – perhaps without\ndamaging security. But entitlement spending has a bigger impact on USA Inc. financials. Although\ndefense nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP, it is still below its 7% share of GDP from 1948 to\n2000. It accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, but 41% of all government spending between 1789 and\n1930.\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: 1) Net margin defined as net income divided by total revenue; 2) net worth defined as assets (ex. stewardship assets like national\nparks and heritage assets like the Washington Monument) minus liabilities minus the net present value of unfunded entitlements (such as\nSocial Security and Medicare), data per Treasury Dept.'s “2010 Annual Report on the U.S. Government”; 3) Gordon Adams and Matthew\nLeatherman, “A Leaner and Meaner National Defense,” Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb 2011)\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n15\n…Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials…\n� Medicare and Medicaid, largely underfunded (based on ‘dedicated’ revenue) and\ngrowing rapidly, accounted for 21% (or $724B) of USA Inc.’s total expenses in F2010,\nup from 5% forty years ago\n� Together, these two programs represent 35% of all (annual) US healthcare spending; Federal Medicaid\nspending has doubled in real terms over the last decade, to $273 billion annually.\n� Total government healthcare spending consumes 8.2% of GDP compared with just\n1.3% fifty years ago; the new health reform law could increase USA Inc.’s budget\ndeficit\n� As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs\ncontinue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).\n� Unemployment Insurance and Social Security are adequately funded...for now. The\nfuture, not so bright\n� Demographic trends have exacerbated the funding problems for Medicare and Social Security – of the\n102 million increased enrollment between 1965 and 2009, 42 million (or 41%) is due to an aging\npopulation. With a 26% longer life expectancy but a 3% increase in retirement age (since Social\nSecurity was created in 1935), deficits from Social Security could add $11.6 trillion (or 140%) to the\npublic debt by 2037E, per Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n16\n…Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials\n� If entitlement programs are not reformed, USA Inc.’s balance sheet will go from bad to\nworse\n� Public debt has doubled over the last 30 years, to 62% of GDP. This ratio is expected to surpass the\n90% threshold* – above which real GDP growth could slow considerably – in 10 years and could near\n150% of GDP in 20 years if entitlement expenses continue to soar, per CBO.\n� As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs\ncontinue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).\n� The turning point: Within 15 years (by 2025), entitlements plus net interest expenses\nwill absorb all – yes, all – of USA Inc.’s annual revenue, per CBO\n� That would require USA Inc. to borrow funds for defense, education, infrastructure, and R&D spending,\nwhich today account for 32% of USA Inc. spending (excluding one-time items), down dramatically from\n69% forty years ago.\n� It’s notable that CBO’s projection from 10 years ago (in 1999) showed Federal revenue sufficient to\nsupport entitlement spending + interest payments until 2060E – 35 years later than current projection.\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the\nrelationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP.\nAbove 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We note that while\nReinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer to the European\ncountries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n17\nHow Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?...\n� Key focus areas would likely be reducing USA Inc.’s budget deficit and improving /\nrestructuring the ‘business model’…\n� One would likely drill down on USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers, then develop a\nbasic analytical framework for ‘normal’ revenue / expenses, then compare options.\n�\n�\nLooking at history…\nAnnual growth in revenue of 3% has been roughly in line with GDP for 40 years* while\ncorporate income taxes grew at 2%. Social insurance taxes (for Social Security / Medicare)\ngrew 5% annually and now represent 37% of USA Inc. revenue, compared with 19% in 1965.\nAnnual growth in expenses of 3% has been roughly in line with revenue, but entitlements are\nup 5% per annum - and now absorb 51% of all USA Inc.’s expense - more than twice their\nshare in 1965; defense and other discretionary spending growth has been just 1-2%.\n�\nOne might ask…\nShould expense and revenue levels be re-thought and re-set so USA Inc. operates near\nbreak-even and expense growth (with needed puts and takes) matches GDP growth, thus\nadopting a ‘don’t spend more than you earn’ approach to managing USA Inc.’s financials?\nNote: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of revenue and expenses. We did not choose the most recent\n40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969, so\nwww.kpcb.com\nmany metrics (like individual income and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n18\n…How Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?\nOne might consider…\n�\n�\n�\nOptions for reducing expenses by focusing on entitlement reform and operating efficiency\n�\n�\nFormula changes could help Social Security’s underfunding, but look too draconian for Medicare/Medicaid;\nthe underlying healthcare cost dilemma requires business process restructuring and realigned incentives.\nResuming the 20-year trend line for lower Federal civilian employment, plus more flexible compensation\nsystems and selective local outsourcing, could help streamline USA Inc.’s operations.\nOptions for increasing revenue by focusing on driving long-term GDP growth and changing tax\npolicies\n� USA Inc. should examine ways to invest in growth that provides a high return (ROI) via new investment in\ntechnology, education, and infrastructure and could stimulate productivity gains and employment growth.\n�\nReducing tax subsidies (like exemptions on mortgage interest payments or healthcare benefits) and\nchanging the tax system in other ways could increase USA Inc.’s revenue without raising income taxes to\npunitive – and self-defeating – levels. Such tax policy changes could help re-balance USA’s economy\nbetween consumption and savings and re-orient business lines towards investment-led growth, though\nthere are potential risks and drawbacks.\nHistory suggests the long-term consequences of inaction could be severe\n�\nUSA Inc. has many assets, but it must start addressing its spending/debt challenges now.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Introduction\n19\nSizing Costs Related to USA Inc.’s Key Financial Challenges\n& Potential AND / OR Solutions\n� To create frameworks for discussion, the next slide summarizes USA Inc.’s various\nfinancial challenges and the projected future cost of each main expense driver.\n� The estimated future cost is calculated as the net present value of expected\n‘dedicated’ future income (such as payroll taxes) minus expected future expenses\n(such as benefits paid) over the next 75 years.\n� Then we ask the question: ‘What can we do to solve these financial challenges?’\n�\nThe potential solutions include a range of simple mathematical illustrations (such as\nchanging program characteristics or increasing tax rates) and/or program-specific\npolicy solutions proposed or considered by lawmakers and agencies like the CBO\n(such as indexing Social Security initial benefits to growth in cost of living).\n� These mathematical illustrations are only a mechanical answer to key financial\nchallenges and not realistic solutions.

We do not\nrecognize those assets either, as we have no basis to measure them. But the\nUS government has substantial intangible assets that should provide future\neconomic benefits.\nNote: For more discussion on alternatives to corporate and official government accounting methods, see Laurence J.

As a result, when\nfunding is limited, government may choose to reduce investments for the future\nto preserve resources for day-to-day operations.\n� Budget “scoring” rules give Congress incentives to hide the true costs...and help\nCongressional committees defend their turf.*\nNote: *For more detail, refer to slide 116 on congressional budget scoring rules related to recent Healthcare reform.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | High Level Thoughts\n32\nMetric Definitions & Qualifiers\n� Cash Flow = ‘Cash In’ Minus ‘Cash Out’\n� Calculated on a cash basis (which excludes changes in non-cash accrual of\nfuture liabilities) for simplicity.\n� One-Time Expenses = ‘Spending Minus Repayments’ for Non-Recurring\nPrograms\n� Net costs of programs such as TARP, ARRA, and GSE bailouts.\n� Net Worth = Assets Minus Liabilities Minus Unfunded Entitlement Liabilities\n� Assets include cash & investments, taxes receivable, property, plant &\nequipment (as defined by Department of Treasury).\n� Liabilities include accounts payable, accrued payroll & benefits, federal\ndebt, federal employee & veteran benefits payable…\n� Unfunded Entitlement Liabilities include the present value of future\nexpenditures in excess of dedicated future revenues in Medicare and Social\nSecurity over the next 75 years.\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: USA Inc. accounts do not follow the same GAAP as corporations.\nUSA Inc. | High Level Thoughts\n33\nCommon Financial Metrics Applied to USA Inc. in F2010\n� Cash Flow Per Share = -$4,171\n� USA Inc.’s F2010 cash flow -$1.3 trillion, divided by population of ~310\nmillion (assuming each citizen holds one share of USA Inc.).\n� Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio = -8x\n� USA Inc. net debt held by public ($9.1 trillion) divided by USA Inc.\nF2010 EBITDA (-$1.1 trillion).

CBO compiled this data from Dept. of Commerce’s Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis (BEA), which maintains the national income and product accounts (NIPA). An important difference between the official budget deficit and the\nNIPA measure of net federal government saving is that the latter excludes such purely financial transactions as the sale of government assets, and most\ntransactions under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, because those transactions do not help to measure current production and income. In addition, historical\nNIPA data are subject to significant revision; historical budget data, by contrast, are rarely revised significantly.

Population and GDP data per IMF.\nUSA Inc. | High Level Thoughts\n44\nThe Original Estimates of Medicare’s Costs\nWere Vastly Underestimated\n• In 1965, the official estimate of Medicare’s costs was $500 million per year,\nroughly $3 billion in 2005 dollars.*\n• The actual cost of Medicare has turned out to be 10x that estimate.\n• Medicare’s actual net loss (tax receipts + trust fund interest – expenditures)\nhas exceeded $3 billion (adjusted for inflation) every year since 1976 and\nwas $146 billion in 2008 alone. In other words, had the original estimate been\naccurate, the cumulative 43-year cost since Medicare was created would\nhave been $129 billion, adjusted for inflation.\n• In fact, the actual cumulative spending has been $1.4 trillion** (adjusted for\ninflation)...in effect, 10x over budget.\n• While calculations have been flawed from the beginning for some of USA Inc.’s\nentitlement programs, little has been done to correct the problems.\n� An accurate economic forecast might have sunk Medicare.\nDavid Blumenthal and James Morone\n“The Lessons of Success – Revisiting the Medicare Story”, November 2008\nwww.kpcb.com\nSources: * Lyndon B.

Income Statement\n• America’s government has grown dramatically - USA Inc.’s revenue as percent of\nGDP has risen from 2% to 15%. Individual / social insurance (Social Security +\nMedicare) taxes have risen dramatically while customs / excise / estate taxes\nhave declined in relative importance. In addition, USA Inc.’s spending as percent\nof GDP has risen to 24% in 2010, up from 3% average between 1790 and 1930.\n• USA Inc.’s average operating income was at or near breakeven for most of the\nperiods from 1910 to 1970.\n• In the 1970s, as healthcare expenses (related to Medicare and Medicaid) began\nto surge, USA Inc. reported more frequent – and bigger – losses.

As a\npercentage of GDP, however, defense spending in the U.S. remains below its 60-\nyear trend.\n• On an inflation-adjusted basis, U.S. defense spending is at its highest level since\nWorld War II.

These surpluses were invested in a\nspecial (non-marketable) series of U.S. Treasury securities, which were then used to finance budget deficits\nin other parts of USA Inc. like Medicaid & Nutrition Assistance.\nAs a result, many observers have argued that Social Security and Medicare Part A Trust Funds’ balances\nare no more than accounting gains on paper owing to: 1) no ‘real’ assets (such as tradable stocks / real\nestates…) in these Trust Funds as the special U.S. Treasury securities are non-marketable and 2) the\nTreasury Department needs to raise taxes / cut other programs’ spending / borrow more money in the future\nto meet any withdrawal requests.\nWe think that for Social Security and Medicare Part A programs, their Trust Funds’ balances have legal\nvalue as USA Inc. is legally obliged to repay the principal and interest on the Treasury securities held in\nrespective Trust Funds.\nHowever, we think that these Trust Fund balances have NO economic value as these cumulative surpluses\nhave been spent by USA Inc. to reduce the borrowing need in the past. When Social Security & Medicare\nbegin net withdrawal from their Trust Funds (likely in 2017E), USA Inc.’s debt levels + interest payments\ngrowth could accelerate, owing to the double whammy of: 1) loss of revenue source (previous surpluses)\nand 2) additional Treasury redemption costs related to Trust Funds’ withdrawal requests.\n�\nConsequently, we exclude Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds’ balances and interest income\nfrom our financial models and calculate their liabilities on a net basis.\nData source: Social Security Administration, Dept. of Health & Human Services, CBO.

In recent\nyears, Medicaid beneficiaries and benefit payments have risen faster than\npopulation and per-capita income growth owing to expanded coverage,\neconomic difficulties and associated sluggish wage growth for low- and\nlower-middle-income families, and continued healthcare cost inflation.\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: Data are inflation adjusted.

States with higher\nper-capita income (like New York) pay ~50% of total Medicaid cost while states with lower per-capita\nincome (like Mississippi) pay ~22%.\nOn average, Medicaid accounted for 21% of total state spending in F2009 (ranging from Missouri at\n35% to Alaska at 8%). Enrollment growth has been accelerating, in part, owing to more people losing\nemployer-sponsored health insurance in the recession, and thus overall Medicaid costs jumped ~11%\nY/Y from October, 2009 to June, 2010.\nState governments (which unlike the federal government must balance their annual budgets) cannot\npay for such elevated levels of Medicaid and maintain normal spending levels for other services (like\neducation and public safety).\nEnter the Federal Government\n�\nARRA (2009 economic stimulus) provided ~$100 billion in support for the states to pay for elevated\nlevels of Medicaid costs and to avoid large budget cuts in education and public safety. This went a\nlong way toward holding down the states’ contribution, but it is a one-time unsustainable fix.\n� Federal Support May Be Expiring by June, 2011\n�\nIf no action is taken, the Medicaid-related cost burden on the states will rise dramatically in coming\nyears. As a result, many states are on the verge of implementing Medicaid cost containment plans\nthat include cuts in doctor payments, benefit limitations, higher patient co-payments, etc. Moreover,\nmany states are fearful that the recently enacted healthcare reform will lead to additional Medicaidrelated\ncosts when it goes into full effect in 2014.\nwww.kpcb.com\nData Source: National Conference of State Legislatures, “State Budget Update: July 2009.”\nUSA Inc. | Income Statement Drilldown\n99\n1\nEntitlement\nSpending\nMedicaid\n(-$273B Net Loss*)\nMedicare\n(-$272B Net Loss* 1 )\nUnemployment\nBenefits\n(-$115B Net Loss*)\nSocial Security\n(-$75B Net Loss* 1 )\n2\nRising Debt\nLevel & Interest\nPayments\nDebt Level\n($9T Outstanding)\nEffective Interest\nRates\n(2.2%)\nDebt Composition\n3\nPeriodic Large\nOne-Time\nCharges\nTARP\n($26B Net Profit* 2 )\nFannie Mae /\nFreddie Mac\n(-$41B Net Loss*)\nARRA\n(-$137B Net Loss*)\nNote: *denotes F2010 net income / net loss of respective programs, data per White House OMB. 1) Medicare and Social Security net loss\nexcludes Trust Fund interest income. 2) TARP net loss includes proceeds from sale of warrants.

Overriding the productivity\nadjustments, as Congress has done repeatedly in the case of physician payment rates, would lead to far\nhigher costs for Medicare in the long range than those projected under current law…For these\nreasons, the financial projections shown [here] for Medicare do not represent a reasonable\nexpectation for actual program operations in either the short range (as a result of the unsustainable\nreductions in physician payment rates) or the long range (because of the strong likelihood that the statutory\nreductions in price updates for most categories of Medicare provider services will not be viable).”\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: Emphasis added.

But it is almost always\nunproductive. A truly effective organization needs incremental investments in programs that drive\ninnovation and higher productivity. Moreover, across-the-board cuts are almost guaranteed to reduce\nmorale, promote short-sighted choices, and encourage accounting gimmicks that send people looking for\nloopholes instead of creative solutions.\n�\nFocus on programs, not costs\n�\nThe greatest productivity gains come from asking questions such as: What things are we doing now that\nwe do not need as much in the future? Can we eliminate them? Reduce their size? Provide them in a\ntotally restructured fashion?\n�\nAllow no exceptions\n�\nTo drive a truly effective restructuring program, everything must be on the table. There can be no sacred\ncows—no part of the organization that is exempt from scrutiny. Every unit of the organization may not\nface a cut, but every unit needs to be rethought.\nwww.kpcb.com\nSource: Louis V.

Most (77%) insurance plans only use a co-pay (in\nexample #1), which gives consumers little incentive to shop the most cost-effective treatment\npath.\nwww.kpcb.com\nSource: Kaiser/HRET Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Benefits, 2009\nUSA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider?\n307\nRestructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors–Possible Solutions\n2) Reimbursement Reform\nReimbursement reform could help shift drivers of payment from quantity of\ncare to quality of care. The following list provides a few options to consider.\n• Bundled Payments: Providers get a fixed budget to treat an episode of care (i.e. a broken\nhip). Exceeding the budget means providers absorb additional costs; staying under it lets\nprovider benefit from savings.\n• Examples: PROMETHEUS Payment System 1 , Medicare Acute Care Episode\nDemonstration 2\n• Global payment system 3 (i.e., capitation): Providers are paid up-front to provide care that their\npatient receives over a period, incentivizing them to manage costs and quality. This global\npayment is adjusted periodically to reward accessible and high-quality care.\n• Pay for performance 4 : Reimbursement for care providers varies, based on various quality and\nefficiency measures such as discharge rate and readmission rate.\n• Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs): Provider groups accept responsibility for the cost\nand quality of care for a specific population of patients 5\n• The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes regulations\nsupporting the creation of Accountable Care Organizations\n• Other models often discussed to improve coordination / efficiency and reduce costs : 1)\nintegrated delivery systems; 2) multispecialty group practices; 3) physician-hospital\norganizations; 4) independent practice associations; 5) virtual physician organizations\nSource: 1) Cutting Healthcare Costs by Putting Doctors on a Budget, Time 1) Adopted in Rockford, IL in Jan 2010 2) Medicare Demonstration Project Overviews,\nwww.cms.gov/demoprojects 3) Recommendations of the Special Commission on the Healthcare Payment, Commonwealth of Massachusetts 4) Pay for\nPerformance Incentive Programs in Healthcare , Geoffrey Baker 5) How the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation Should Test Accountable Care\nOrganizations, Stephen Shortell, Lawrence P.

And a tax increase of this nature would surely have a\nsignificant negative impact on USA’s GDP growth as consumers would have far less\ndisposable income to buy goods and services.\n� This brings us to a key element of USA’s financial challenges – the need to drive\neconomic (GDP) AND related job growth. This is not easy. A material portion of GDP\ngrowth over the past few decades was driven by rising consumption aided by rising\nleverage and we have now entered a period of de-leveraging.\n� Stronger economic growth would be hugely beneficial for USA Inc.’s revenues. But\nthe legacy of the financial crisis – severe housing imbalances and the need to\ncomplete the long process of writing off private mortgage debt – means that the US\nrecovery will probably remain slow for at least several years. The silver lining: A\nbooming global economy should provide a modest lift to US growth.\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: 1) USA Inc.’s F2009 revenue shortfall was $997B (excluding one-time discretionary spending items). F2009 total\nincome tax receipts from individuals were $915B. As a result, if one were to raise individual income tax rates alone to achieve\nfinancial break-even, one would have to more than double individual income tax rates across-the-board.\nUSA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 357\nDrive Growth: If Real GDP Grows 0.1 Percentage Point Faster Than Current\nCBO Projection For F2011-F2020E, the Budget Deficit Could Shrink by 5%\nWithout Other Policy Changes\n� CBO analysis shows that for every 0.1 percentage point (pps) increase in real GDP annual\ngrowth rate above CBO’s baseline estimate for F2011-F2020E, USA Inc.’s revenue (driven\nby taxes) could be $247 billion higher, spending could be $41 billion lower (driven by\nreduced welfare spending) and the budget deficit could be reduced by $288 billion, or 5%.\nF2011-F2020E Impact on USA Inc.’s\nCBO’s baseline\nassumption for annual\nreal GDP growth\nWhat if real GDP\ngrows faster than\nCBO’s forecast by…\nRevenue\n($B / %)\nSpending\n($B / %)\nDeficit\nReduction\n($B / %)\n0.1 pps\n+$247\n+1%\n-$41\n--%\n-$288\n-5%\n2.1% F2011E\n4.4% F2012-14E\n2.4% F2015-20E\n0.5 pps\n1 pps\n+$1,235\n+3%\n+$2,470\n+6%\n-$205\n--%\n-$410\n-1%\n-$1,440\n-23%\n-$2,880\n-46%\n2 pps\n+$4,940\n+13%\n-$820\n-2%\n-$5,760\n-92%\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: pps is percentage point(s). $ amount and % changes in revenue / spending / deficit are over the entire F2011-F2020E\nperiod.

Financials\n� Summary – USA Inc. has challenges.\n� Cash Flow – While recession depressed F2008-F2010 results, cash flow has been negative\nfor 9 consecutive years ($4.8 trillion, cumulative), with no end to losses in sight. Negative\ncash flow implies that USA Inc. can't afford the services it is providing to 'customers,' many\nof whom are people with few alternatives.\n� Balance Sheet – Net worth is negative and deteriorating.\n� Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities – Off-balance sheet liabilities of at least $31 trillion (primarily\nunfunded Medicare and Social Security obligations) amount to nearly $3 for every $1 of debt\non the books. Just as unfunded corporate pensions and other post-employment benefits\n(OPEB) weigh on public corporations, unfunded entitlements, over time, may increase USA\nInc.’s cost of capital. And today’s off-balance sheet liabilities will be tomorrow’s on-balance\nsheet debt.\n� Conclusion – Publicly traded companies with similar financial trends would be pressed by\nshareholders to pursue a turnaround. The good news: USA Inc.’s underlying asset base and\nentrepreneurial culture are strong. The financial trends can shift toward a positive direction,\nbut both ‘management’ and ‘shareholders’ will need collective focus, willpower, commitment,\nand sacrifice.\nNote: USA federal fiscal year ends in September; Cash flow = total revenue – total spending on a cash basis; net worth includes\nunfunded future liabilities from Social Security and Medicare on an accrual basis over the next 75 years. Source: cash flow per\nWhite House Office of Management and Budget; net worth per Dept. of Treasury, “2010 Financial Report of the U.S.\nwww.kpcb.com\nGovernment,” adjusted to include unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare.\nUSA Inc. | Summary 438\nDrilldown on USA Inc. Financials…\n� To analysts looking at USA Inc. as a public corporation, the financials are challenged\n�\nExcluding Medicare / Medicaid spending and one-time charges, USA Inc. has supported a 4% average net\nmargin 1 over 15 years, but cash flow is deep in the red by negative $1.3 trillion last year (or\n-$11,000 per household), and net worth 2 is negative $44 trillion (or -$371,000 per household).\n� The main culprits: entitlement programs, mounting debt, and one-time charges\n�\n�\n�\nSince the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with the best of intentions,\ncreated various entitlement programs. Some of these serve the nation’s poorest, whose struggles have\nbeen made worse by the financial crisis. Apart from Social Security and unemployment insurance,\nhowever, funding for these programs has been woefully inadequate – and getting worse.\nEntitlement expenses (adjusted for inflation) rose 70% over the last 15 years, and USA Inc. entitlement\nspending now equals $16,600 per household per year; annual spending exceeds dedicated funding by\nmore than $1 trillion (and rising). Net debt levels are approaching warning levels, and one-time charges\nonly compound the problem.\nSome consider defense spending a major cause of USA Inc.’s financial dilemma. Re-setting priorities and\nstreamlining could yield savings – $788 billion by 2018, according to one recent study 3 – perhaps without\ndamaging security. But entitlement spending has a bigger impact on USA Inc. financials. Although\ndefense nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP, it is still below its 7% share of GDP from 1948 to\n2000. It accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, but 41% of all government spending between 1789 and\n1930.\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: 1) Net margin defined as net income divided by total revenue; 2) net worth defined as assets (ex. stewardship assets like national\nparks and heritage assets like the Washington Monument) minus liabilities minus the net present value of unfunded entitlements (such as\nSocial Security and Medicare), data per Treasury Dept.'s “2010 Annual Report on the U.S. Government”; 3) Gordon Adams and Matthew\nLeatherman, “A Leaner and Meaner National Defense,” Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb 2011)\nUSA Inc. | Summary 439\n…Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials…\n� Medicare and Medicaid, largely underfunded (based on ‘dedicated’ revenue) and\ngrowing rapidly, accounted for 21% (or $724B) of USA Inc.’s total expenses in F2010,\nup from 5% forty years ago\n� Together, these two programs represent 35% of all (annual) US healthcare spending; Federal Medicaid\nspending has doubled in real terms over the last decade, to $273 billion annually.\n� Total government healthcare spending consumes 8.2% of GDP compared with just\n1.3% fifty years ago; the new health reform law could increase USA Inc.’s budget\ndeficit\n� As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs\ncontinue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).\n� Unemployment Insurance and Social Security are adequately funded...for now. The\nfuture, not so bright\n� Demographic trends have exacerbated the funding problems for Medicare and Social Security – of the\n102 million increased enrollment between 1965 and 2009, 42 million (or 41%) is due to an aging\npopulation. With a 26% longer life expectancy but a 3% increase in retirement age (since Social\nSecurity was created in 1935), deficits from Social Security could add $11.6 trillion (or 140%) to the\npublic debt by 2037E, per Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Summary 440\n…Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials\n� If entitlement programs are not reformed, USA Inc.’s balance sheet will go from bad to\nworse\n� Public debt has doubled over the last 30 years, to 62% of GDP. This ratio is expected to surpass the\n90% threshold* – above which real GDP growth could slow considerably – in 10 years and could near\n150% of GDP in 20 years if entitlement expenses continue to soar, per CBO.\n� As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs\ncontinue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).\n� The turning point: Within 15 years (by 2025), entitlements plus net interest expenses\nwill absorb all – yes, all – of USA Inc.’s annual revenue, per CBO\n� That would require USA Inc. to borrow funds for defense, education, infrastructure, and R&D spending,\nwhich today account for 32% of USA Inc. spending (excluding one-time items), down dramatically from\n69% forty years ago.\n� It’s notable that CBO’s projection from 10 years ago (in 1999) showed Federal revenue sufficient to\nsupport entitlement spending + interest payments until 2060E – 35 years later than current projection.\nwww.kpcb.com\nNote: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the\nrelationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP.\nAbove 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We note that while\nReinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer to the European\ncountries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.\nUSA Inc. | Summary\n441\nHow Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?...\n� Key focus areas would likely be reducing USA Inc.’s budget deficit and improving /\nrestructuring the ‘business model’…\n� One would likely drill down on USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers, then develop a\nbasic analytical framework for ‘normal’ revenue / expenses, then compare options.\n�\n�\nLooking at history…\nAnnual growth in revenue of 3% has been roughly in line with GDP for 40 years* while\ncorporate income taxes grew at 2%. Social insurance taxes (for Social Security / Medicare)\ngrew 5% annually and now represent 37% of USA Inc. revenue, compared with 19% in 1965.\nAnnual growth in expenses of 3% has been roughly in line with revenue, but entitlements are\nup 5% per annum - and now absorb 51% of all USA Inc.’s expense - more than twice their\nshare in 1965; defense and other discretionary spending growth has been just 1-2%.\n�\nOne might ask…\nShould expense and revenue levels be re-thought and re-set so USA Inc. operates near\nbreak-even and expense growth (with needed puts and takes) matches GDP growth, thus\nadopting a ‘don’t spend more than you earn’ approach to managing USA Inc.’s financials?\nNote: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of revenue and expenses. We did not choose the most recent\n40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969, so\nwww.kpcb.com\nmany metrics (like individual income and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.\nUSA Inc. | Summary 442\n…How Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?\nOne might consider…\n�\n�\n�\nOptions for reducing expenses by focusing on entitlement reform and operating efficiency\n�\n�\nFormula changes could help Social Security’s underfunding, but look too draconian for Medicare/Medicaid;\nthe underlying healthcare cost dilemma requires business process restructuring and realigned incentives.\nResuming the 20-year trend line for lower Federal civilian employment, plus more flexible compensation\nsystems and selective local outsourcing, could help streamline USA Inc.’s operations.\nOptions for increasing revenue by focusing on driving long-term GDP growth and changing tax\npolicies\n� USA Inc. should examine ways to invest in growth that provides a high return (ROI) via new investment in\ntechnology, education, and infrastructure and could stimulate productivity gains and employment growth.\n�\nReducing tax subsidies (like exemptions on mortgage interest payments or healthcare benefits) and\nchanging the tax system in other ways could increase USA Inc.’s revenue without raising income taxes to\npunitive – and self-defeating – levels. Such tax policy changes could help re-balance USA’s economy\nbetween consumption and savings and re-orient business lines towards investment-led growth, though\nthere are potential risks and drawbacks.\nHistory suggests the long-term consequences of inaction could be severe\n�\nUSA Inc. has many assets, but it must start addressing its spending/debt challenges now.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Summary\n443\nSizing Costs Related to USA Inc.’s Key Financial Challenges\n& Potential AND / OR Solutions\n� To create frameworks for discussion, the next slide summarizes USA Inc.’s various\nfinancial challenges and the projected future cost of each main expense driver.\n� The estimated future cost is calculated as the net present value of expected\n‘dedicated’ future income (such as payroll taxes) minus expected future expenses\n(such as benefits paid) over the next 75 years.\n� Then we ask the question: ‘What can we do to solve these financial challenges?’\n�\nThe potential solutions include a range of simple mathematical illustrations (such as\nchanging program characteristics or increasing tax rates) and/or program-specific\npolicy solutions proposed or considered by lawmakers and agencies like the CBO\n(such as indexing Social Security initial benefits to growth in cost of living).\n� These mathematical illustrations are only a mechanical answer to key financial\nchallenges and not realistic solutions. In reality, a combination of detailed policy\nchanges will likely be required to bridge the future funding gap.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Summary 444\nOverview of USA Inc.’s Key Financial Challenges\n& Potential and/or Solutions\nRank\nFinancial\nChallenge\nNet Present Cost 1\n($T / % of 2010 GDP)\n1 Medicaid $35 Trillion 3 / 239%\n2 Medicare $23 Trillion / 156%\n3\n4\nSocial\nSecurity\nSlow GDP /\nUSA\nRevenue\nGrowth\n$8 Trillion / 54%\n--\nMathematical Illustrations\nand/or Potential Policy Solutions 2\n• Isolate and address the drivers of medical cost inflation\n• Improve efficiency / productivity of healthcare system\n• Reduce coverage for optional benefits & optional enrollees\n• Reduce benefits\n• Increase Medicare tax rate\n• Isolate and address the drivers of medical cost inflation\n• Improve efficiency / productivity of healthcare system\n• Raise retirement age\n• Reduce benefits\n• Increase Social Security tax rate\n• Reduce future initial benefits by indexing to cost of living growth rather\nthan wage growth\n• Subject benefits to means test to determine eligibility\n• Invest in technology / infrastructure / education\n• Remove tax & regulatory uncertainties to stimulate employment growth\n• Reduce subsidies and tax expenditures & broaden tax base\n5\nGovernment\nInefficiencies\n--\n• Resume the 20-year trend line for lower Federal civilian employment\n• Implement more flexible compensation systems\n• Consolidate / selectively local outsource certain functions\nNote: 1) Net Present Cost is calculated as the present value of expected future net liabilities (expected revenue minus expected costs) for each program / issue over the\nnext 75 years, Medicare estimate per Dept. of Treasury, “2010 Financial Report of the U.S. Government,” Social Security estimate per Social Security Trustees’ Report\n(8/10). 2) For more details on potential solutions, see slides 252-410 or full USA Inc. presentation. 3) Medicaid does not have dedicated revenue source and its $35T net\npresent cost excludes funding from general tax revenue, NPV analysis based on 3% discount rate applied to CBO’s projection for annual inflation-adjusted expenses.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc. | Summary 445\nThe Essence of America’s Financial Conundrum\n& Math Problem?\nWhile a hefty 80% of Americans indicate balancing the budget should\nbe one of the country’s top priorities, per a Peter G.

The\nACO model is one of the latest designs for\nmanaging healthcare costs and especially\nMedicare costs, and is gaining traction\namong policymakers desperate to control\ncosts and boost quality in healthcare.\nAccrual accounting - A system of\naccounting in which revenues are recorded\nwhen they are earned and outlays are\nrecorded when goods are received or\nservices are performed, even though the\nactual receipt of revenues and payment for\ngoods or services may occur, in whole or in\npart, at a different time. Compare with cash\naccounting.\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI) - All income\nthat is subject to taxation under the\nindividual income tax after \"above-the-line\"\ndeductions for such things as alimony\npayments and certain contributions to\nindividual retirement accounts.

Over a business cycle, real\n(inflation-adjusted) activity rises to a peak\n(its highest level during the cycle) and then\nfalls until it reaches a trough (its lowest level\nfollowing the peak), whereupon it starts to\nrise again, defining a new cycle. Business\ncycles are irregular, varying in frequency,\nmagnitude, and duration.

In practice, the Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis counts purchases of\nmany long-lasting goods (such as cars and\nclothes) as consumption even though the\ngoods are not used up. Consumption by\nhouseholds alone is also called consumer\nspending. See national income and product\naccounts.\nCost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) - An\nannual increase in Social Security and other\nentitlement payments to reflect price\ninflation.\nCurrent-Account Balance - A summary\nmeasure of a country’s current transactions\nwith the rest of the world, including net\nexports, net unilateral transfers, and net\nfactor income (primarily the capital income\nfrom foreign property received by residents\nof a country offset by the capital income from\nproperty in that country flowing to residents\nof foreign countries).\nCyclical Deficit or Surplus - The part of the\nfederal budget deficit or surplus that results\nfrom the business cycle. The cyclical\ncomponent reflects the way in which the\ndeficit or surplus automatically increases or\ndecreases during economic expansions or\nrecessions.\nCyclically Adjusted Budget Deficit or\nSurplus - The federal budget deficit or\nsurplus that would occur under current law if\nthe influence of the business cycle was\nremoved—that is, if the economy operated\nat potential gross domestic product.\nwww.kpcb.com\nUSA Inc.\nxx\nDebt - In the case of the federal\ngovernment, the total value of outstanding\nbills, notes, bonds, and other debt\ninstruments issued by the Treasury and\nother federal agencies.

The\nchange in the GDP price index is used as a\nmeasure of inflation in the overall economy.\nGeneral Fund - One category of federal\nfunds in the government’s accounting\nstructure. The general fund records all\nrevenues and offsetting receipts not\nearmarked by law for a specific purpose and\nall spending financed by those revenues and\nreceipts.\nGovernment-Sponsored Enterprise (GSE)\n- A financial institution created by federal\nlaw, generally though a federal charter, to\ncarry out activities such as increasing credit\navailability for borrowers, reducing borrowing\ncosts, or enhancing liquidity in particular\nsectors of the economy, notably agriculture\nand housing.

Enrollees\ntypically pay limited copayments and are\nusually required to select a primary care\nphysician through whom all care must be\ncoordinated. HMOs generally will not\nreimburse all costs for services obtained\nfrom a non-network provider or without a\nprimary care physician's referral. HMOs\noften emphasize prevention and careful\nassessment of medical necessity.\nIndependent Payment Advisory Board\n(IPAB) - A 15-member Independent\nPayment Advisory Board created under\nPPACA with significant authority with\nrespect to Medicare payment rates.\nBeginning in 2014, in any year in which the\nMedicare per capita growth rate exceeded a\ntarget growth rate, the IPAB would be\nrequired to recommend Medicare spending\nreductions. The recommendations would\nbecome law unless Congress passed an\nalternative proposal that achieved the same\nlevel of budgetary savings. Subject to some\nlimitations—hospitals, for example, would be\nexempt until 2020—the IPAB could\nrecommend spending reductions affecting\nMedicare providers and suppliers, as well as\nMedicare Advantage and Prescription Drug\nPlans.\nLabor Force - The number of people age 16\nor older in the civilian non-institutional\npopulation who have jobs or who are\navailable for work and are actively seeking\njobs. (The civilian non-institutional\npopulation excludes members of the armed\nforces on active duty and people in penal or\nmental institutions or in homes for the elderly\nor infirm.) The labor force participation rate\nis the labor force as a percentage of the\ncivilian non-institutional population age 16 or\nolder.\nMarginal Tax Rate - The tax rate that would\napply to an additional dollar of a taxpayer’s\nincome.

MBSs are structured\nby their sponsors to create multiple classes\nof claims, or tranches, of different seniority,\nbased on the cash flows from the underlying\nmortgages. Investors holding securities in\nthe safest, or most senior, tranche stand first\nin line to receive payments from borrowers\nand require the lowest contractual interest\nrate of all the tranches. Investors holding the\nleast senior securities stand last in line to\nreceive payments, after all more senior\nclaims have been paid. Hence, they are first\nin line to absorb losses on the underlying\nmortgages. In return for assuming that risk,\nholders of the least senior tranche require\nthe highest contractual interest rate of all the\ntranches.\nNational Commission on Fiscal\nResponsibility and Reform - A bipartisan\ncommission created by President Obama to\naddress the nation's fiscal challenges. The\nCommission is charged with identifying\npolicies to improve the fiscal situation in the\nmedium term and to achieve fiscal\nsustainability over the long run. Specifically,\nthe Commission shall propose\nrecommendations designed to balance the\nbudget, excluding interest payments on the\ndebt, by 2015. In addition, the Commission\nshall propose recommendations that\nmeaningfully improve the long-run fiscal\noutlook, including changes to address the\ngrowth of entitlement spending and the gap\nbetween the projected revenues and\nexpenditures of the Federal Government.\nNet Interest - In the federal budget, net\ninterest comprises the government’s interest\npayments on debt held by the public (as\nrecorded in budget function 900), offset by\ninterest income that the government\nreceives on loans and cash balances and by\nearnings of the National Railroad Retirement\nInvestment Trust.

The present value depends on the\nrate of interest used (the discount rate). For\nexample, if $100 is invested on January 1 at\nan annual interest rate of 5 percent, it will\ngrow to $105 by January 1 of the next year.\nHence, at an annual 5 percent interest rate,\nthe present value of $105 payable a year\nfrom today is $100.\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct (PPACA) – A federal statute as the\nresult of the healthcare reform. Signed into\nlaw on 3/23/10, the PPACA aims to expand\nMedicaid eligibility, incentivize businesses to\nprovide health care benefits, prohibit denial\nof coverage/claims based on pre-existing\nconditions, establish health insurance\nexchanges, and support for medical\nresearch. The costs of these provisions are\noffset by a variety of taxes, fees, and costsaving\nmeasures, such as new Medicare\ntaxes for high-income brackets, taxes on\nindoor tanning, improved fairness in the\nMedicare Advantage program relative to\ntraditional Medicare, and fees on medical\ndevices and pharmaceutical companies.\nProductivity - Average real output per unit\nof input. Labor productivity is average real\noutput per hour of labor. The growth of labor\nproductivity is defined as the growth of real\noutput that is not explained by the growth of\nlabor input alone. Total factor productivity is\naverage real output per unit of combined\nlabor and capital services. The growth of\ntotal factor productivity is defined as the\ngrowth of real output that is not explained by\nthe growth of labor and capital. Labor\nproductivity and total factor productivity differ\nin that increases in capital per worker raise\nlabor productivity but not total factor\nproductivity.\nTax Expenditures - Losses to the U.S.\ntreasury from granting certain deductions,\nexemptions, or credits to specific categories\nof taxpayers. Tax breaks are one method\nCongress uses to promote certain policy\nobjectives. For example, deductions for\nmortgages encourage home ownership,\nwhile credits for childcare expenses allow\nsingle parents to work. Tax expenditures are\nan alternative to direct government spending\non policy programs.\nTroubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) -\nA program that permits the Secretary of the\nTreasury to purchase or insure troubled\nfinancial assets. Authority for the program\nwas initially set by the Emergency Economic\nStabilization Act of 2008 at $700 billion in\nassets outstanding at any one time and\nremains in effect until October 3, 2010.
