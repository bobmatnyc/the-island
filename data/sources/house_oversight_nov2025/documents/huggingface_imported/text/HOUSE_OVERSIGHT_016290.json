  "text": "DISSIDENT MESSAGES\nJaan Tallinn\n\nJaan Tallin, a computer programmer, theoretical physicist, and investor, is a co-\ndeveloper of Skype and Kazaa.\n\nIn March 2009, I found myself in a bland franchise eatery next to a noisy California\nfreeway. I was there to meet a young man whose blog I had been following. To make\nhimself recognizable, he wore a button with a text on it: Speak the truth even if your voice\ntrembles. His name was Eliezer Yudkowsky, and we spent the next four hours discussing\nthe message he had for the world—a message that had brought me to that eatery and\nwould end up dominating my subsequent work.\n\nThe First Message: the Soviet Occupation\n\nIn The Human Use of Human Beings, Norbert Wiener looked at the world through the\nlens of communication. He saw a universe that was marching to the tune of the second\nlaw of thermodynamics toward its inevitable heat death. In such a universe, the only\n(meta)stable entities are messages—patterns of information that propagate through time,\nlike waves propagating across the surface of a lake. Even we humans can be considered\nmessages, because the atoms in our bodies are too fleeting to attach our identities to.\nInstead, we are the “message” that our bodily functions maintain. As Wiener put it: “It is\nthe pattern maintained by this homeostasis, which is the touchstone of our personal\nidentity.”\n\nI’m more used to treating processes and computation as the fundamental building\nblocks of the world. That said, Wiener’s lens brings out some interesting aspects of the\nworld which might otherwise have remained in the background and which to a large\ndegree shaped my life. These are two messages, both of which have their roots in the\nSecond World War. They started out as quiet dissident messages—messages that people\ndidn’t pay much attention to, even if they silently and perhaps subconsciously concurred.\nThe first message was: Zhe Soviet Union is composed of a series of illegitimate\noccupations. These occupations must end.\n\nAs an Estonian, I grew up behind the Iron Curtain and had a front row seat when\nit fell. I heard this first message in the nostalgic reminiscences of my grandparents and in\nbetween the harsh noises jamming the Voice of America. It grew louder during the\nGorbachev era, as the state became more lenient in its treatment of dissidents, and\nreached a crescendo in the Estonian Singing Revolution of the late 1980s.\n\nIn my teens, I witnessed the message spread out across widening circles of\npeople, starting with the active dissidents, who had voiced it for half a century at great\ncost to themselves, proceeding to the artists and literati, and ending up among the Party\nmembers and politicians who had switched sides. This new elite comprised an eclectic\nmix of people: those original dissidents who had managed to survive the repression,\npublic intellectuals, and (to the great annoyance of the surviving dissidents) even former\nCommunists. The remaining dogmatists—even the prominent ones—were eventually\nmarginalized, some of them retreating to Russia.\n\nInterestingly, as the message propagated from one group to the next, it evolved. It\nstarted in pure and uncompromising form (“The occupation must end!”) among the\ndissidents who considered the truth more important than their personal freedom.
