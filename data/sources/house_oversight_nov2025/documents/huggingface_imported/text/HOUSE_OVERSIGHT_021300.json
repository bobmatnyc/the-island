  "text": "reciprocal control of the autonomic\nbranches. Rather, higher level systems\nengage in highly sophisticated “banter”\nwith the autonomic nervous system.\n\nIn contrast to the reciprocal\ncontrol characteristic of autonomic\nreflexes, higher level brain circuits exert\nmore flexible control over the autonomic\nnervous system. This can include the\nclassic reciprocal control pattern, but can\nalso include an independent control\npattern in which only the sympathetic\nbranch or only the parasympathetic\nbranch of the autonomic nervous system\nis activated, and a coactive control\npattern in which both branches are\nactivated. This greater flexibility in\ncontrol may have behavioral and health\nsignificance.\n\nBeliefs about One’s Relationship with\nGod and Autonomic Functioning\n\nRecently, we used a population-\nbased sample of 50-68-year-old adults in\nthe Chicago Health, Aging and Social\nRelations Study to examine risk factors\nfor heart attack, a health outcome known\nto be influenced the autonomic nervous\nsystem. We were particularly interested\nin whether spirituality influenced risk for\nheart attack. With very few exceptions,\neveryone in our sample expressed a\nbelief in God. However, individuals\ndiffered in how they perceived the\nquality of their relationship with God,\nmuch as individuals differ in how they\nperceive the quality of their relationships\nwith other people. We defined\nspirituality as the degree to which a\npersonal relationship with God was\nbelieved to offer safety, security,\ncontentment, and love. One observation\nthat emerged from this study was that\nspirituality was associated with a lower\nincidence of heart attack (7). This\nremained true after ruling out the effects\n\nPage |54\n\nof demographics, health behaviors, body\nmass index, blood pressure, and other\npotential explanatory factors. Short of\ndivine intervention, was there a rational\nexplanation for this relationship? We\ncertainly know that psychological factors\ncan impact autonomic control, among\nother aspects of physiology.\n\nAs considered above, when\nextreme or prolonged, sympathetic\nactivation may have harmful\nconsequences. Heightened sympathetic\nactivation is known, for example, to\npredict a poorer outcome after heart\nattack. In contrast, parasympathetic\nactivity may have beneficial or\nprotective effects. From the perspective\nof a reciprocal model of autonomic\ncontrol, high parasympathetic/low\nsympathetic control would be optimal\nwhereas high sympathetic/low\nparasympathetic control would be\nconsidered a risk. But we also know that\nhigher level neurobehavioral systems\nmay not be constrained to reciprocal\nautonomic controls. Moreover, it has\nbeen argued that more autonomic control\nis better than little control, in that if\naffords greater capacity for adjustment\nof visceral functions. Could high levels\nof parasympathetic control, for example,\nmitigate the negative effects of\nsympathetic activation and perhaps yield\nan even more advantageous health\noutcome?\n\nTo examine these questions, we\ndeveloped two quantitative measures of\nautonomic control (7). The first was a\ncommon metric of autonomic balance\n(Cardiac Autonomic Balance), which\nrepresents the relative dominance of the\ntwo branches along a single autonomic\ncontinuum that ranges from purely\nparasympathetic control to purely\nsympathetic control. This metric is\nconsistent with the classical model of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021300",
