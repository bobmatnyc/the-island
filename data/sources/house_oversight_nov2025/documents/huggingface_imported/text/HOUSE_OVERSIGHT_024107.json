  "text": "Appendix 3\n\nPME+ Methodology\n\nPublic Market Equivalent (“PME+”) is used to compare the net performance of each of the\nSprout HC synthetic funds and NLV funds to the performance of a same size, hypothetical\ninvestment in a fund that tracked a public market index. The investments in the hypothetical\npublic market index funds have identical cash inflow schedules and proportionately\ncomparable cash outflow schedules. The cash outflow schedules are set so that the remaining\nequity value of the public equivalent fund is exactly equal to the remaining equity value of the\nbenchmarked private equity fund at the end of the benchmarking period. The analysis is\npresented to illustrate the comparative returns a limited partner would have generated by\ninvesting in the hypothetical public market index fund at the same time and in the same\namounts as had been invested in each of the NLV or Sprout (HC portion only) synthetic funds.\nThe NLV or Sprout HC funds are presented as net, which includes the impact of management\nfees, expenses, and carried interest. The public market index funds do not have any impact of\nfees or carried interest. A more detailed description of the PME+ methodology used is available\nin: Rouvinez, Christophe. “Asset Class: Beating the Public Market.” Private Equity\nInternational.
