  "text": "Mentioned briefly above was one of humankind’s beacons, Pythagoras, the\nintellectual and spiritual progenitor of Plato. He taught the disciples of the\nPythagorean Brotherhood in Crotona, Italy, that reality at its deepest level was\nmathematical thought. Studies there included philosophy, geometry, music and\nastronomy, all at the service of achieving closer union with the Divine. Pythagoras\nand his school, only his student’s writings remain, was said to be working at unifying\nelements of the ancient tribal mystery cults with the observables of worldly events\nthrough meditative, mathematical, philosophical mysticism. Knowledge was gained\nthrough spiritual intuition made harmonious with formal systems of thought. As Plato\nlater said and as quoted by Thomas Heath in his 1921 History of Greek\nMathematics, about the study of the motion of stars, “...leave the heavens alone...”\nbecause what one sees is only an approximation of the real and more perfect\nmathematical structures involving points, lines and circles. To which Newton added\nan elongated circle, the ellipse, and Nineteenth and Twentieth Century\nmathematicians and physicists, the geometries of positively and negatively curved\nspace.\n\nIt is perhaps not an accident that debates about evidence for the existence\nand location of God and where the ideas and structures of mathematics live and\nbreath generally involves a stand off between those that believe that both are out\nthere and can be seen, like thoughtful, humanistic actions and caring service for\nneedful others, versus those that feel the phenomenology of both are projections of\nthe psychobiologically intuitive Brain God and can be felt like an ecstatic rush of\n\ninsightful illumination.\n\nFurther Reading for Faith And Rationality\n\nIntroduction of Comparative Mysticism.
