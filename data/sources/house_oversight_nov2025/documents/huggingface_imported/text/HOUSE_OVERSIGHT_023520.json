  "text": "strongest economy and military, complete with an arsenal of nuclear\nweapons. The chief threats to Israel are from new technologies —\nrockets, biological weapons — and demography. Its physical\nexistence is less in doubt than its democratic existence as it continues\nto rule millions of Palestinians in serf-like conditions — entitled to\nneither a vote nor a country.\n\nThe path to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been clear\nfor 20 years. Israel would cede most of the land it conquered in the\n1967 war to a Palestinian state, keeping the major settlement blocks.\nIn return, it would get a series of measures designed to protect its\nsecurity. That’s why the process is called land for peace. The problem\nis that Netanyahu has never believed in land for peace. His strategy\nhas been to put up obstacles, create confusion and wait it out. But one\nday there will be peace, along the lines that people have talked about\nfor 20 years. And Netanyahu will be remembered only as a person\nbefore the person who made peace, a comma in history.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023520",
