  "text": "Reflections on Invisible Connections\n\nEchoing a prominent theme in\nthis volume, Christopher Masi highlights\nonce again the centrality of social\nconnectedness for human well-being and\nthe function of loneliness in signaling a\nrupture in a sense of social\nconnectedness. One might reasonably\nexpect that a social species like Homo\nsapiens would have a sufficiently large\nbehavioral repertoire to be able to\nresolve feelings of isolation and restore a\nsense of social connectedness. Although\nresolution is accomplished readily in\nsome instances for some people some of\nthe time, the reality is that at times\npeople are at a chronic loss for how to\nsatisfy their need for social connection.\nUnfortunately, the invisible bonds of\nsocial connection are not easily repaired.\nWe see others’ social activity, but we do\nnot see how they feel about their social\nlives and sense of connection. Despite\nour inability to recognize loneliness in\nothers, or, as Nick Epley and Jean\nDecety argued earlier in this volume,\nbecause of this handicap in seeing into\nthe minds of others, we tend to attribute\nto others what we ourselves have felt or\nwould expect to feel in particular\ncircumstances. Is it any surprise that we\ntarget for intervention those\ncircumstances where we observe few\nopportunities for social interaction,\ninadequate social skills, and poor social\nsupport? On the other hand, because\nloneliness is in the mind of the sufferer,\nit is perhaps surprising that we would\nexpect changes in objective social\ncircumstances to be sufficient to\nalleviate loneliness in all its sufferers.\nMasi provides a quantitative review of\nstrategies employed to alleviate\nloneliness to show that interventions to\ndate have been only modestly successful\nin reducing feelings of loneliness,\n\nPage |138\n\nattesting to the challenge of effectively\naddressing the problem of ruptured\nsocial connections.\n\nInvisibility should not thwart\nattempts to alleviate distress, however.\nBiological causes of disease were no\nmore visible or evident in the 18\"\ncentury than psychological causes are\ntoday. Yet significant scientific advances\nduring the 19\" and 20\" centuries\ncompletely revolutionized medical\npractice, life expectancy, and quality of\nlife. Farr Curlin is less interested in the\ninvisible causes of disease than in the\nprimordial need for social connection\nthat John Cacioppo introduced and that\nCurlin regards as a preexistent condition\nfor medicine. If science can be viewed as\na cognitive system that steps us back so\nthat we can deal more objectively and\neffectively with another person’s\ndistress, then religion can be viewed as a\ncognitive system that steps us forward to\nconnect and care for others. Curlin\nargues that the practice of medicine\nrequires a balance of these forces, and\nthat the resulting tension between the\ntwo produces better care for the patient\nthan does the practice of medicine using\neither alone.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021384",
