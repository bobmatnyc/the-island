For a fifty-two-year-old\n\nRS RS ea Rn ar RY RY en a aE\n\nFirtuy Ricw\n\nman, he’s extremely fit. Six feet tall, 180 pounds, brown eyes, a\nstrong jawline.\n\nHe’s never been a drinker. He doesn’t smoke or take drugs,\nand he takes care good care of his body as well as his mind.\n\nIts a magnificent mind. His gift is for numbers: complex calcu-\nlations, abstract formulas. Even as a child, Jeffrey could untangle\nmath problems that would stump most smart adults. Numbers just\nfall into place for him, forming in ranks he can bend, twist,\nmanipulate—and multiply. He could have been a scientist or a\nmathematician. As a young man, he taught calculus and physics.\nThen he became an investor—a very rich man. Then he became a\nphilanthropist, like Bill Gates. His love for science has inspired him\nto give millions to academics and institutions committed to study-\ning mysteries of the brain and the arcana of physics. He's given mil-\nlions to Harvard. And he’s given money to politicians: Governor\nEliot Spitzer, of New York, and Governor Bill Richardson, of New\nMexico, where Epstein owns the largest home in the state.\n\nEpstein’s flown Bill Clinton to Africa on a private jet—not\nthe Gulfstream he owns but his Boeing 727, customized with its\nown trading floor—so that the former president could promote\nhis various and worthy causes.\n\nJust for fun, Chris Tucker, the comedian, and Clinton’s pal\nKevin Spacey had tagged along for the ride.\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed\nphilanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an\nin-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science,” Clinton\nwould say through a spokesperson. “I especially appreciated his\ninsights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and\ncombating HIV/AIDS.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019123",
