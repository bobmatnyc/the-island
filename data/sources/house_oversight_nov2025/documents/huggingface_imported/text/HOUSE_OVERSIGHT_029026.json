That was a\nfascinating, fascinating overview. I am particularly struck by your argument, then, that in\nfact, capitalism would spread around the world based on the Judeo-Christian foundation\nis, in fact, something that can create peace through peoples rather than antagonism, which\nis often a point not sufficiently appreciated.
