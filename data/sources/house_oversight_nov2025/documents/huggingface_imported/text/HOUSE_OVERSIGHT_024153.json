  "text": "Japanese equities\n\nTopix (27 June): 745 (last month: 721)\nUBS View Topix (6-month target): 780\n¢ We expect earnings growth of about 45% over the coming 12 months. This exceptional high growth is\nmainly due to the two natural disasters last year, as well as tax regulation changes which caused a\nnumber of one-time losses to be booked in the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.\ne In our base case scenario, we see only limited scope for an additional earnings boost from the local\neconomic recovery, given the slowing in export markets. Japanese companies are expected to continue\ntheir cost reduction efforts to counter the impact of a strong yen.\n¢ The Japanese government has started implementing its JPY 18tn recovery budget in 4Q 2011, and we\nexpect the budget to boost Japanese GDP by 1-1.5% in FY2012.\ne Mainly due to the earnings rebound, we expect the TOPIX trailing P/E to drop from around 16.5x to 14x\n— 14.5x by year end; still the earnings rebound should provide some room for moderate price increases.\n\n4 Positive scenario Topix (6-month target): 900\n¢ Stronger global demand and stabilizing European markets provide an additional boost to earnings, and\nalso lead to improved risk taking. Falling risk aversion is likely to lead to a weaker yen, providing further\nupside to earnings. TOPIX target is based on 16.0x trailing P/E.\n\n& Negative scenario Topix (6-month target): 600\n¢ Faltering global growth leads to weak exports, triggering negative earnings surprises. A strengthening\nUSDJPY below 75 in response to rising risk aversion might provide an additional drag on the economy and\nearnings. We would then expect the P/E ratio to contract to 13.5x, even if earnings show no recovery.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nJPY and exports The exchange rate is an important factor for the Japanese equity market, and\ncentral bank intervention is a key swing factor. Japan’s trade balance could be in\ndeficit and may impact USDJPY rates. Key date: 09 July, Japanese trade\n\nbalance\n\nBoJ’s monetary policy\n\nThe Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) additional commitment to its asset purchase program,\nboard meeting\n\nwhich is currently JPY 65tn in size, would lead to a weaker yen, in our view. Key\ndate: 12 July, BoJ policy meeting\n\n36 UBS\n\nFor further information please contact ClO asset class specialist Toru Ibayashi, toru.ibayashi@ubs.com\n\nPreference: neutral\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne The earthquake in Japan and recent\nfloods in Thailand have impacted\nJapanese earnings negatively. A recovery\nfrom these disasters should benefit auto\nand industrial stocks in particular.\n\ne We prefer companies that continue cost\nreduction initiatives to maintain price\ncompetitiveness during the period of yen\nstrength.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne A weaker USDJPY may drive Japanese\ncompanies’ earnings recovery beyond a\ntechnical recovery from natural disasters.\n\ne Arapidly aging population and the lack\nof a powerful and stable government\nremain negative for the country's longer-\nterm economic prospects.\n\nJapanese realized earnings likely to\nrecover going forward\n95\n8&5\n75\n65\n55:\n45\n35\n25\n15\n5\n(5)\n1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012\n\n— Topix: 12m realized earnings per share\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters, UBS CIO, as of 21 June 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n18\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024153",
