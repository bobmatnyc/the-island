  "text": "an exploit.15¢ But the real drive to get inside is about more than an adrenaline rush.\nRemember that network power, the power that we're trying to figure out how to\nbend and shape for our own security, exists in a kind of dynamic tension. It’s like a\nstretched, taut fabric spread between concentrated cores and billions of connected\nusers or devices. The logic of spreading and distributed power, the force that makes\nthe network bigger, is driven by Baran’s principle of open design, and by our own\nhunger for communications and connection and cool new devices. But there is\nanother side to this tension.\n\nIn a sense, over the years, a whole set of hot, infectious pressures descended on the\nnetwork of values and friendships and easy cooperation of the Hack-Tic days. “Be\ngenerous in what you receive,” had let the networks of our age grow at an incredible\npace, but at the price of vulnerability, of commercial ambition, and of an eerie\ntechnological lemma that what made the systems faster and stronger might also kill\nthem. A change in culture of the digital elite, naturally, followed. The brutal,\ninarguable, profitable demands of power and politics had cracked apart the unique\nsocial webs of the HacTic era. I did not like watching this sad evolution; none of us\ndid, but anyhow it has produced the world in which our new sensibility will have to\noperate. The openness that we loved and craved in so many areas of life, from our\nminds to our markets, had now become a liability. “I remember what the Internet\nwas like before it was being watched and there had never been anything in the\nhistory of man that is like it,” Edward Snowden once observed, nostalgic for the\ndatascape he saw melt away during his time at the NSA. 157 I realize now that there\nis a whole new generation of young programmers that won't ever know that original\ngenerous ethos of a place like Hacktic, a fresh cohort of the digital age that operates\nat levels of technical mastery far beyond anything we might have imagined in the\nCiticorp Tower basement 20 years ago. They will confront endless battles to get\ninside and exploit and make “weird” the cores of network power. They will know\nand design and manage instead a world of gates, built for protection. Their instincts\nwill be for opacity and control, not openness and generosity. Invariably this shift\nwill affect the design of the systems this new generation builds which will, in turn,\naffect all of us.\n\nThe black boxes and the crackers are in a dance, now, a sort of dangerous\nevolutionary waltz that offers a foretaste of what you and I will face as we consider\nthe problems of attack and defense and strategy in a networked age!*®.
