  "text": "294 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\ndifferent feel to them. My question is this. Is there more to face-to-face\ncommunication between human beings than the simple exchange of\nsymbolic information?\n\nLet us propose an experiment. I erect a 3D screen with a hi-fi\nsurround sound system in a university lecture hall and deliver a lecture\nto a camera in the adjacent hall. Half the students see the lecture directly,\nand half remotely. With modern screens, it might be possible to set up\nthe experiment so well that is difficult to tell which hall I am actually in.\nIs the experience of the remote students the same as the ones sitting in\ndirect proximity with me? Do mirror neurons fire more strongly and\npick up more information when you see me in the flesh, or is the feeling\nthat a lecture is better when you are ‘physically there’ an illusion? You are\nperhaps less likely to fall asleep in my lecture if you are physically there\nbecause you are afraid I might walk over and hit you! What possible non-\nclassical effects could be in play when you see an event or communicate\nin person that might make the communication different? Here are two\npotential differences:\n\nInformation in a face-to-face encounter is continuous, not digitized.\nContinuous information is infinite in nature and does not have the finite\nlimitation of digitized data. Of course, if we have digitized the sound\nat 24 bits and replayed it with extreme fidelity, there should not be any\nloss in information, but the interactivity of the soundscape is hard to\nsimulate.\n\nLight entering your eye contains information that could be quantum\nentangled with the object you are viewing. You become part of the system\nrather than merely an independent observer. It is difficult to see why this\nwould produce a different quality of communication but it is testable.\nSet up the lecture experiment and measure the quality of understanding\ncommunicated between the parties.\n\nIf we believe our brains are super-Turing, then considering there\nmight be some similar effects involved in human communication is not\nunreasonable, perhaps quantum effects play a role in communication. If\nwe conclude our brains think classically, then we probably communicate\nclassically.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015984",
