  "text": "including those involving the choice of the embedding space vis a vis the “true”\ndimension of the attractor. This becomes an issue when, for example, the attractor\nshrinks over time to some subspace of the initial embedding (Liebert et al, 1991 and\n\nreferences therein).\n\nlf we imagine the process of time series reconstruction to inscribe an\nattractor’s untidy ball-of-string of recurrent trajectories in three dimensions, we can\nthen, by making the z-dimension a constant value, cut the ball with a two\ndimensional plane, a “Poincaré surface of section.” This could yield a roundish\ncloud of discrete points on the x,y plane and t,-1 — tp would be the time between two\npiercings of this surface. It has been proven that almost any cut, as long as it is\nmade transverse to the direction of the orbital trajectories, is equally valid and useful\nfor further analyses (Oseledec, 1968). If the original embedding and subsequence\nsection was in high enough dimension to allow invertability, we might have enough\n(trial and error) knowledge to be able to write a discrete equation, a “return map,” f,\n\nthat would move one point to the next on the plane as (x,y)/, , <> (x,y)¢,.\n\nWhat can sometimes be case with real systems (Coffman et al, 1986), is that\nreducing the geometric reconstruction still one dimension further, accepting non-\ninvertability, ironing down the points in the plane onto the x axis line (normalized to\n[0,1]), and plotting the values at x; against x1 (“mapping the unit interval to itself’),\ncan generate points in the general shape of a parabola with dynamics representable\nby the same family of one parameter, single maximum discrete equations that\ngenerated May's sequence of bifurcations, Feigenbaum’s scaling and Metropolis,\nStein and Stein’s (and Sharkovskii’s) U sequence (see discussions of qualitative\nand quantitative universalities above).\n\nAlthough sometimes a significant change in brain system physiology, such as\npenicillin-induced epileptic neuron spiking activity is revealed simply by a change in\nthe graphic appearance of suitably embedded time series data (Zimmerman and\nRapp, 1991), more often statistical measures made on the geometric dynamics of\n\nthe points on the attractor are required.\n\n217\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013717",
