  "text": "either, because I didn't know how to describe exactly how. I thought I'd figure it out as\nwe went along, and then I would tell him exactly what it took.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't that easy. Months and years passed without replicating the\nincident. Anxiety began seeping back. My Unified Orgasm Theory was not doing well.\n\nMy fear of being perceived as \"demanding\" during sex and relationships was at a\nridiculous extreme back then. For example, I'd heard over and over that boys don't like\ngirls who are \"high-maintenance,\" so I told my boyfriends that I never wanted them to\nbuy me flowers. I thought that men would feel relieved that they didn't \"have to cater to\nme,\" but they were just puzzled. (One responded by buying me fake flowers.)\n\nBecause of the awful shaming stereotypes around cunnilingus, I sometimes refused that\ntoo. I couldn't believe that the boyfriends who were willing to go down on me were\nactually enthusiastic about it, enjoying it -- and when my anxiety became too painful, I\ninevitably stopped them. I always stopped them long before I stopped enjoying the act,\nbecause I was so scared that they hated it, and hated me for wanting it. I was scared that\nthey resented me more and more, the longer they did it and I didn't come. My fear crept\nup my spine and twisted around my heart until I had to make them stop.\n\nSometimes I felt trapped between love and disgust, like with the boyfriend who\nconstantly complimented me on how great in bed I was, but who seemed unaware of how\nmuch I felt missing. The worst was when he went off on a rhapsodic list of my wonderful\nqualities ending with: \"... and I don't even have to worry about giving you an orgasm!\"\nHe didn't see the bind he was putting me in, the awful self-suppression and self-wounding\nthat he encouraged. He seemed unaware that I heard him telling me: \"You're great in bed\nbecause you are constantly disappearing your own needs, and never asking anything\ncomplicated of me!”\n\nIn fairness, I wasn't giving him any guidance on how to do better with me. In fairness, I\nhad no idea what kind of guidance to give.\n\nThey had their own social programming, and I didn't communicate well. But sometimes I\nstill have trouble forgiving my early boyfriends.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nIV. The Fight\n\nNot all my boyfriends were willing to do as little as going down on me. One, in\nparticular, resisted very strongly; never did it at all. This was an especial problem because\nhe was one of the men I've loved most in my life, and our relationship lasted for years. I\nthink well of him when I think of anything other than sex. But when I remember having\nsex with him, I feel echoes of sick panic and heartbreak.\n\nBy the end, every time I slept with him I felt nothing but disgust.\n\nHe seemed to prove all my fears: that the men in my life would loathe and resent me if I\ntried to discuss my confusion and desperation; that they would loathe and resent me if I\n\nasked for help with my sexual needs. Towards the beginning of our relationship, I tried\n\nasking him (very timidly) to go down on me, and he simply refused. In later\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018501",
