Right after this\nimportant event, the Chinese government should take advantage\nof the major shifts in the Americas, look across the Pacific\nand launch a parallel effort: the “Belt and Sea Lane” initiative\nfor China and Latin America (Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central\nand South America).\nThree recent seismic changes have dramatically affected Latin\nAmerica. First, the economic links that China has developed\nover the past 13 years with South America. Second, the end of\npopulism in this region. Third, the election of Donald Trump as\npresident of the United States, which will severely damage economic\nintegration in the Americas, as shown by the recent\ndemise of the US-led Trans-Pacific-Partnership agreement. Let\nus broadly review these three waves to understand the opportunity\nfor China.\nSouth America swayed from the “lost half decade” of 1998-\n2003, to the “golden decade” of 2004-14, and this change happened\nmainly because of China. South American nations are\nrich in minerals, energy and food, which China started buying at\ngrowing prices and in ever increasing volumes. China is the\nmain purchaser and price driver for commodities; whether it is\ncopper from Chile, soybeans from Argentina or Paraguay, iron\nore and grains from Brazil, gold from Peru, beef from Uruguay,\ntin from Bolivia, oil from Venezuela and Ecuador, or coal from\nColombia.\nThis economic link became crystal clear in the US financial\ncrisis of 2008 that slowed down the economies of Mexico, Central\nAmerica and the Caribbean (CAC), which all depend heavily\non exports to the US market and remittances from there, but\nSouth America kept growing so long as China kept growing. The\ndividing line became clear: in Latin America, south of the Panama\nCanal the economic driver is China, north of the Panama\nCanal it still is the US.\nChina has become the main buyer of South American commodities,\na more important lender and an active investor. The\nchallenge remains to have China become a full blown, long-term\ndevelopment partner for South America.\nThe Chinese influence in Mexico-CAC is different. Here China\nis viewed as a competitor for access to the US market with manufactured\ngoods (Mexico) and textiles (CAC), as well a price hiker\nfor food products, and fuel that CAC needs to import. So the\nChinese economic influence is dominant in South America. The\nUS has been the prevailing influence in Mexico and CAC, until\nTrump was elected. The future for Mexico and CAC is now\nuncertain.\nWith sky-high commodity prices, South America was governed\naccording to the Hugo Chavez project in Venezuela, the\nWorkers Party (PT) in Brazil, the Kirchner power couple in\nArgentina, and other like-minded projects in the region. South\nAmerican coffers were filled by Chinese purchases of oil, grains\nand minerals, as populist regimes reigned over South America.\nThere was a tendency to nationalize companies, spend freely, set\nlow unsustainable consumer prices, close off free trade and not\nbe very friendly to foreign investment in general.\nWith the commodity price decline since 2014 (especially oil\nprices) and voters fed up with and tired of corruption and abuses\nof populist regimes, the tide turned. More countries now have\nmarket-friendly governments. The end of populism in South\nAmerica bodes well for China, as the current governments are\nmore open to Chinese investment, more open to trade and can\nassure a better structural framework to collaborate with China.\nFor the first time in its history, the US has elected a president\nwho combines a protectionist trade position with an anti-migration\npolicy. Trump has particularly targeted Mexico, promising\nto deport 11 million people, to build a wall by seizing remittances\nsent from the US, to hike duties for manufactured goods and\nabrogate the North American Free Trade Agreement. This is\nvery worrisome for Mexico, but it also affects many countries in\nLatin America that have citizens sending remittances from the\nUS. The trade disruption will eventually affect all CAC countries,\nas well as Chile, Colombia and Peru, that all have similar free\ntrade treaties with the US.\nSouth America swayed to the “golden\ndecade” of 2004-14, and this change\nhappened mainly because of China.\nTaking into account the economic interdependence between\nChina and South America, the end of populism in South America,\nand the dramatic threats that the Trump administration poses\nto Mexico and CAC, it is clear that time, circumstances and\nevents are providing a significant opening for China to propose\na full-blown partnership with Latin America.\nThe proposal should seize the opportunity of the “demise” of\nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Mexico now needs reliable\npartners, unlike the US; so will CAC very soon; and South\nAmerica needs to deepen its strong trade ties with China.\nPresident Xi Jinping can take advantage of his strengthened\nposition as the core leader of China, his commitment to address\nclimate change and his stance as the world’s free trade leader,\nwhich will help China to extend its Belt and Road Initiative\ntoward Latin America, across the Pacific, with a “Belt and Sea\nLane” proposal. The basic elements of it should be trade, loans,\ninvestment and respect for human dignity (No deportations. No\ndiscrimination). A new trade framework, the active presence of\nthe China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in Latin\nAmerica and the expansion of Confucian Institutes should be\npart of this initiative. Latin America is ready and ripe for such a\nproposal.\nThis is the right time to show that while some want to build\nwalls to divide and separate, China wants to build a bridge\nacross the Pacific to integrate and link Asia and Latin America.\nJust one opportunity illustrates the potential of a deeper China-Latin\nAmerica partnership. China is the world’s leading\nmanufacturer of lithium batteries, close to 90 percent of the\nworld’s lithium reserves are in South America. Our new, deeper\npartnership can easily prevail in the race to lead the new wave of\nlithium batteries for cleaner, more efficient development in the\n21st century.\nThe window of opportunity is now the Belt and Sea Lane Initiative\nfor a stronger China-Latin America partnership.\nThe author is former president of Bolivia.\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\nXi’s philosophy for engaging with\nthe world embodied in initiative\nThe Belt and Road Forum for\nInternational Cooperation\nwill be held on Sunday and\nMonday. How does the initiative\nexpress President Xi Jinping’s\npolitical philosophy with respect to\nChina’s foreign and domestic policy?\nXi’s foreign policy is to engage the\nworld, safeguard China’s core interests,\nencourage mutual economic\ndevelopment, and facilitate China’s\nemergence as a great power. Xi’s\ndomestic policy stresses reform, rule\nof law, and the realization of an allround\nmoderately prosperous society,\nwhich requires the alleviation of\nextreme poverty.\nHere’s how the Belt and Road Initiative\nenhances the four pillars of China’s\nforeign policy.\nA multi-polar world has long been\na cornerstone of China’s foreign policy,\nwhich opposes domination by one\nor two superpowers. The Belt and\nRoad Initiative engages more than 60\ncountries along multiple land and\nmaritime routes and exemplifies a\nmulti-polar world.\nPeaceful development is China’s\nwatchword. It has vowed that no matter\nhow powerful the country\nbecomes, it will never seek domination.\nThe Belt and Road projects are\nfounded on mutual cooperation,\nshared development and joint construction\nirrespective of the size or\npower of the host country.\nPeople-to-people communications\nare an integral part of the Belt and\nRoad Initiative: multi-channel, multilevel\nexchanges between peoples to\nThere was a time not long ago\nwhen most big social and\neconomic challenges were\ndomestic. With good policies\nand good implementation of those\npolicies, many countries could tackle\nthese problems alone. China’s recent\nsuccess in lifting millions of people\nout of poverty is a perfect example of\nthis.\nBut today, our challenges are not\nonly domestic, and they are not only\nsocial and economic.\nClimate change, pollution, and the\nloss of biodiversity are environmental\nissues that spill over borders.\nAnd today, issues such as poverty,\ninequality, peace and security are\nnot only problems facing individual\ncountries.\nThese are global challenges.\nThey must be tackled collectively.\nA number of countries\nare leading the way in\nfostering international\ncooperation. China,\nwith its Belt and\nRoad Initiative, is\none of them.\nEvidence of this\ncan be seen in\nEthiopia, where\nChina has helped\nto build a metro\nsystem in Addis\nAbaba, and in\nKenya, where a\nstandard gauge\nrailway is being\nbuilt to link the\nport of Mombasa\nfirst with Nairobi,\nand ultimately with\nneighboring Uganda,\nRwanda, and\nSouth Sudan. In recent\nyears, Chinese companies\nhave aslo led renewable\nenergy projects in\nplaces such as Pakistan,\nThailand and the Philippines.\nSuch massive investment in\ndevelopment is on a scale never\nbefore seen. And there is great\nprogress to be made on security, economic\nand social challenges.\nBut we cannot forget the other\nglobal challenge that we must face\ntogether: protecting the environment.\nUN Environment also recognizes\nthe potential of the Belt and Road initiative\nto improve people’s lives. We\nalso know how important it is to do\nthis sustainably.\nIf we do not make Belt and Road\nprojects climate friendly, we put the\nworld at risk from worsening pollution\nand severe climate change. If\npromote mutual understanding.\nExamples include sister cities, cultural\nactivities, non-governmental organizations,\nand public diplomacy.\nA “community of shared future” is\nhow Xi epitomizes the dreams of\ndiverse peoples in common pursuit of\npeace and development. In this context,\nthe 2,000-year history of\nexchanges along the ancient Silk\nRoad provides precedence that different\ncountries, races, religions, beliefs,\npolitical systems and cultural backgrounds\ncan achieve peace and share\nthe fruits of their interactions — provided\nthey persist in seeking common\ngoals and mutual trust, equality and\nmutual benefit, and tolerance and\nmutual learning.\nThe Belt and Road Initiative will be\nsuccessful to the extent that China’s\nprinciples of domestic development\ncan be adopted and adapted by other\ndeveloping countries according to\ntheir own conditions. Xi’s overarching\nprinciples for guiding China’s\ndomestic transformation are innovation,\ncoordination, greenness, openness\nand sharing.\nHow does each relate to the Belt\nand Road Initiative?\nLarge-scale infrastructure projects\nrequire structural innovation, especially\nin their financing and investment\nrobustness. (The Belt and Road\nprojects must be financially viable;\nthey are not foreign aid.) The Asian\nInfrastructure Investment Bank, initiated\nby China to facilitate projects,\nis itself a major innovation.\nFor each Belt and Road project,\nChina’s spirit of openness,\nas well as its policy\nof opening-up\npolicy catalyzed the\ncountry’s economic\ndevelopment.\ndiverse components, such as the local\ngovernment, project management,\ninternational financing, and foreign\nand domestic constructing companies\nmust be coordinated so they\nwork together.\nAs developing countries are more\nconcerned about economic development\nthan environmental protection,\nthe short-sighted move of shipping\noff polluting industries to them\nshould be guarded against. If Belt and\nRoad projects pollute host countries,\nlocal populations will come to resent\nChina. Environmental protection and\ngreen development are essential.\nChina’s spirit of openness, as well\nas its opening-up policy catalyzed the\ncountry’s economic development.\nThis same spirit and policy can energize\ncountries along the Belt and\nRoad while respecting local cultures\nand conditions. But what worked in\nChina, if transplanted wholesale, will\nErik Solheim\nESTABLISHING\nGREEN ROUTES\nFOR GROWTH\nLI MIN / CHINA DAILY\nlikely not work elsewhere. The challenge\nfor developing countries is to\nadapt what makes sense for their own\nconditions.\nSharing is the essence of the Belt\nand Road Initiative. It is the proper\nspirit for all human beings and it is\nessential for maintaining global stability.\nInequalities are a primary\ncause of instability. Shared development\nis as much a matter of transferring\nexperience as it is of transferring\nmoney.\nJust as these five major development\nconcepts are transforming China’s\nsociety and rebalancing China’s\neconomy, the Belt and Road Initiative\ncan transform the developing world’s\ninfrastructure and rebalance the\nentire global economy.\nChina cannot aspire to global leadership\nby means of power alone. Economic\nand military strength, while\nnecessary, are not sufficient. There\nmust also be a moral or ethical arc to\nChina’s rise, and this includes Belt\nand Road projects. China, as Xi\nasserts, should “balance justice and\nbenefits, stress faithfulness, value\nfriendship, carry forward righteousness,\nand foster ethics.”\nThere will be challenges: unforeseen\nevents that China will have to\nhandle with sensitivity. But can China\ndemonstrate moral as well as economic\nleadership?\nThe author is a public intellectual,\npolitical/economics commentator,\nand international corporate strategist.\ndone right, millions will see the benefits\nof green growth.\nNow is the time to do it right and\nmake Belt and Road as green as possible.\nThat is why UN Environment\nsigned an agreement with the Chinese\nMinistry of Environmental Protection\nin December to promote the sustainable\ndevelopment of the Belt and Road.\nThere are many ways we will support\nthis. Our environmental expertise\nruns from sustainable finance and\nclean technologies to ecosystems and\nsustainable consumption and production.\nUN Environment can support\ntechnology transfer and the creating\nof green economy policies. Through\nour Finance Initiative, we can\nwork with private investors to\npromote sustainable investment\npractices along the Belt\nand Road.\nBut we cannot do it\nalone. Many other stakeholder\ngroups, investors,\nand businesses have valuable\nexpertise to bring\nto the table. And many\nBelt and Road countries\nhave asked specifically\nfor such\nsupport to make sure\nthat the Belt and\nRoad Initiative helps\nthem meet their sustainable\ndevelopment\nneeds.\nAnd so, at the Belt\nand Road Forum for\nInternational Cooperation\nin Beijing this\nweek, UN Environment\nand China’s Ministry of\nEnvironmental Protection\nwill announce the\nInternational Coalition for\nGreen Development on the\nBelt and Road.\nUN Environment and China\nwill bring together dozens\nof partner organizations in this\ncoalition. We want to draw\nknowledge from the largest body\nof environmental expertise possible\nto ensure that Belt and Road brings\nlong-term, planet-friendly growth.\nThe forum this week will bring\ntogether a significant portion of that\nexpertise. I see it as the beginning of a\nclose collaboration and hope to grow\nour coalition. We all want the Belt and\nRoad Initiative to fulfil its promise as\na positive force for development. We\nmust work together to ensure that\ndevelopment is sustainable.\nThe author is head of\nUN Environment.",
