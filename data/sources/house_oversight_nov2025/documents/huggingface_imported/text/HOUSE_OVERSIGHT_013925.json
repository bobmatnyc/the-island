  "text": "Bua outsourcer takes a piece of the revenue pie. Here is what the general profit-loss might look like\n\nfor a hypothetical $80 product sold via phone and developed with the help of an expert, who is paid a\nroyalty. I recommend calculating profit margins using higher-than-anticipated expenses. This will\naccount for unforeseen costs (read: screwups) and miscellaneous fees such as monthly reports, etc.\n\nREVENUE\nProduct cost $80.00\nShipping/Handling $12.95\nTotal Revenue $92.95\nEXPENSES\nProduct manufacturing $10.00\nCall center ($0.83 per minute x average\n\ncall time of 4 minutes) $3.32\nShipping $5.80\nFulfillment ($1.85 per package + $0.50 for\n\nboxes/packing) $2.35\nCredit card processing (2.75% of $92.95) $2.56\nReturns + declined cards (6% of $92.95) $5.58\nRoyalties (5% of wholesale price of $48 [$80 = .6]) $2.40\nTotal expenses $32.01\nPROFIT (revenue minus expenses) $60.94\n\nHow do you factor in advertising cost? If a $1,000 ad or $1,000 in PPC produces 50 sales, my\nadvertising cost per order (CPO) is $20. This makes the actual‘ per-unit profit $40.94.\n\nI set a new goal after that experience, and when I was interviewed six months later as a follow-up, one\nchange was more pronounced than all others: silence. I had redesigned the business from the ground up\nso that I had no phone calls to answer and no e-mail to respond to.\n\nI’m often asked how big my company is—how many people I employ full-time. The answer is one.\nMost people lose interest at that point. If someone were to ask me how many people run Brain-\n\nQUICKEN LLC, on the other hand, the answer is different: between 200 and 300. I am the ghost in the\n\nmachine 22\n\nFrom advertisements—print in this example—to a cash deposit in my bank account, the diagram is\nwhat a simplified version of my architecture looks like, including some sample costs. If you have\ndeveloped a product based on the guidelines in the last two chapters, it will plug into this structure hand-\nin-glove.\n\nWhere am I in the diagram? Nowhere.\n\nI am not a tollbooth through which anything needs to pass. I am more like a police officer on the side\nof the road who can step in if need be, and I use detailed reports from outsourcers to ensure the cogs are\nmoving as intended. I check reports from fulfillment each Monday and monthly reports from the same\nthe first of each month. The latter reports include orders received from the call center, which I can\ncompare to the call center bills to gauge profit. Otherwise, I just check bank accounts online on the first\nand fifteenth of each month to look for odd deductions. If I find something, one e-mail will fix it, and if\nnot, it’s back to kendo, painting, hiking, or whatever I happen to be doing at the time.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013925",
