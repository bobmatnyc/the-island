  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nEventually, after a long and torturous road through the Arizona courts, the death penalties against\nRicky, and Raymond Tison were reversed. They would not be executed, despite the Supreme\nCourts green light. Once again, as with the issue of obscenity, the Highest Court did not get the\nlast word. We refused to give up, and in the end we prevailed. Ricky and Raymond are now\neligible for parole and may soon be free. Greenwalt, who was represented by other lawyers, was\nexecuted.\n\nFollowing the reversal of their death penalties, one of the brothers wrote me a letter saying that\nhis minister had told him that Jews can’t go to heaven. My client pleaded with me to convert to\nChristianity so that we could spend eternity in the same place. I wrote him a nice letter back\nsaying that Jews believe that they can go to heaven. He wrote back telling me that he had decided\nto become a Jew, because he wanted to be sure he would be in the same heaven that I was in. I\nreplied assuring him that I had checked, and that Jews and Christians go to the same heaven, so\nthat he didn’t have to convert.’\n\n°! Another one of my clients, a far more sophisticated one, did convert to Judaism — on a weekly basis. He\ndiscovered that all the Jews in a particular federal prison were taken out every Friday night to have Shabbat dinner\nin the homes of local Jews where they were treated to wonderful home-cooked meals. He told me that since he had\nbecome a Jew, he had gotten to love “those balls made out of fish and the other balls that they put in the chicken\nsoup.” I reminded him that he had always been a very religious Catholic, and he said, “Oh I’m still a religious\ncatholic. My priest has given me permission to be a Jew on Friday night as long as I go back to being a Catholic\nfor Sunday morning.”\n\n178\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017265",
