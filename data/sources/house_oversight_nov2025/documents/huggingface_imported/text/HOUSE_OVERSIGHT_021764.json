Thanks for agreeing to have this discussion. \nRegards, \nMike \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #1 \nHe was over 50. And they were girls \nBy Elisa Cramer \nHASH(Ox5fa474) \nFriday, August 04, 2006 \nIf the women whom Palm Beach police say a part-time town resident invited to his home \nand paid for sex acts were, in fact, women, the solicitation charge against Jeffrey Epstein \nmight feel more sufficient. But, according to police records, they weren't. He was over \n50. And they were girls. 14. 15.16.17-year-old girls. That should count for something - \nthe difference between prostitution and pedophilia. \nSo, it is baffling that Mr. Epstein, who was indicted last month by a grand jury on one \nfelony count of solicitation of prostitution, has not been charged, as Palm Beach police \nstrenuously urged, with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious \nmolestation. \nConviction of crimes against minors would mean steeper penalties than the maximum \nfive-year prison term Mr. Epstein faces if convicted of the single count of felony \nsolicitation. It also would help carry a message of intolerance to perverts who prey on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021764 \ngirls. \nProsecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims \nbecause they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous, \nuntrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive. \nMr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law \nprofessor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney Jack Goldberger, has denied knowing \nhow old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses \nunder oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that \npolice found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home, \nprovide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers. \nOne girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another \ntime, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his \"massage\" session because the girl he wanted was \nstill in class. \nWhy didn't State Attorney Bany Krischer let a jury decide whether to believe the \nteenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to \"work\" in \nDecember 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas \ngifts? \nProsecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in \nan apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that \nsome of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use. \nThe 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr. \nEpstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name \"Pimpin' \nMade EZ.\" \nAlthough no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of \nthe teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men. \nPolice determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr. \nGoldberger denied knowing anything about it. \nPolice also note in their reports that the state attorneys office offered Mr. Epstein a plea \ndeal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to \nwalk away with no criminal record at all. \nI asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a \ngrand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And \nshouldn't the victims credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been \ncommitted, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm \nBeach Post of Mr. Epstein, \"He's never denied girls came to the house.\") \nEspecially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case \nand think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us? \nMr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the \nlatter point, he offered, for the sake of \"philosophical debate\": \"Whether wealth buys a \ndifferent standard of justice across the country ... the answer to that would, of course, be \nyes.\" \nBut in this case, he said, \"regardless of the battery of attorneys, the outcome would be the \nsame. Every issue that was debated in public was debated in our office before this case \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021765 \nwent to the grand jury.\" \nIn this case, it is not the victims credibility but the state attorneys that deserves \nquestioning. \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #2 \nMassaging the system \nPalm Beach Post Editorial \nThursday, August 10, 2006 \nPalm Beach police say their 11-month investigation shows that 53-year-old part-time \ntown resident Jeffrey Epstein committed unlawful sex acts with and lewd and lascivious \nmolestation on five underage girls. Defense attorney Jack Goldberger claims that his \nclient, Jeffrey Epstein, had no idea that the untrained girls he hired for massages were \nminors. \nThe Palm Beach Count State Attorneys Office could have let a jury decide whom to \nbelieve. Instead, State Attorney Barry Krischer left the public to wonder whether the \nsystem tilted in favor of a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very \nyoung girls who are alleged victims of sex crimes. \nMr. Krischer took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which last month \nindicted Jeffrey Epstein on one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That decision \ncame after Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz met with prosecutors to undermine \nthe credibility of the 14- to 17-yearold girls who charged that Mr. Epstein had paid them \n$200 to $300 to undress and massage him in his five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath home on the \nIntracoastal Waterway. \nThe girls, Mr. Dershowitz told prosecutors, had written on myspace.com about smoking \nmarijuana and drinking alcohol. But if the girls have a credibility problem, what about \nJeffrey Epstein? Mr. Goldberger, told The Post: \"Mr. Epstein absolutely insisted anybody \nwho came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified that, I don't know.\" And \nprosecutors took him at his word? \nPolice collected evidence that refutes Jeffrey Epstein's defense. Police searched his home \nand garbage and found phone messages about the girls' school schedules and even a high \nschool transcript, suggesting that Mr. Epstein at least knew that the girls were teenagers. \nThe state attorneys office has responded to criticism from Palm Beach police and others \nby noting the higher standard prosecutors face for conviction than law-enforcement \nofficers do for arrest. But in this case, the state attorney bowed to the risk that a jury \nmight look at both Jeffrey Epstein and the girls, and point fingers at both sides. \nEven if the girls could be impugned as prostitutes, solicitation of a minor is a crime. \nFormer disc jockey and teacher Bruno Moore was charged with that Tuesday. \nInvestigators say the 34-year-old used the Internet - myspace.com - to recruit a 13-year \nold. \nPolice say Jeffrey Epstein used a 20-year-old woman who had a myspace.com  \naccount to recruit young girls. His actions were sleazy. It would have been good to ask a \njury just how criminal they were. \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #3 \nSpare us the outrage \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021766 \nWednesday, February 13, 2008 \nAn 11-month police investigation led to an indictment on one felony charge of \nsolicitation of prostitution. That was in July 2006, and part-time Palm Beacher \nJeffrey Epstein still has faced no repercussions for allegedly preying on underage \ngirls. \nSo maybe Mr. Epstein is satisfied that he's getting his moneys worth from his large \nlegal team, which includes Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz \n(remember O.J. Simpson?) and Kenneth Starr (remember Monica Lewinsky?). Jack \nGoldberger of West Palm Beach, who's also on the team, told Post columnist Jose \nLambiet in November: \"This case is absolutely going to end without a trial within \nthe next two months.\" \nHe was wrong, but Mr. Goldberger remains on Mr. Epstein's payroll, feigning \nmoral outrage at two lawsuits filed this year against the Manhattan money \nmanager. The lawsuits allege sexual exploitation of teenaged girls, one of \nthem as young as 14. Said Mr. Goldberger after the first lawsuit, seeking \nmore than $50 million, was filed on Jan. 24: \"We think this shows what this \ncase is all about: money.\" Yes, it is - Mr. Epstein's effort to buy his way out \nof prosecution. \nAccording to the lawyer of a 17-year-old whose parents are suing him, Mr. Epstein \nmasturbated in front of her (she was 14 at the time) and used a vibrator on her at his \nhome in February 2005. Another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez dismissed it: \n\"Jeffrey Epstein did not have sex with this woman.\" \nFor those girls who claim that he did, Mr. Epstein's lawyers maintain that he did not \nknow their ages, despite a police search of his home and garbage that found phone \nmessages about the girls school schedules and even a high school transcript. For all of \nhis money, Mr. Epstein's best defense remains \"I didn't know that I was a criminal \npervert\"? \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #4 \nRich man fought the law and he mostly won \nPalm Beach Post Editorial \nMonday, July 07, 2008 \nTwo years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of \nprostitution, Jeffrey Epstein finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 \nmillion, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for sex. A week ago, the 55-yearold \ninvestment banker began serving 18 months in jail. \nBut that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a \nperson under the age of 18 for prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, \none as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually abused them. And why is Epstein \nserving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state prison, where \ninmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year? \nThe slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public \nPost your that there's a different system of justice for the wealthy who hire highcomments \npowered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021767 \non this attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, \nwho defended O.J. Simpson against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the \nprosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying about sex with \nyoung women. \nPalm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry \nKrischer sent the case to a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once \nboasted of accepting only billionaire clients could face a trial. The police had taken a high \nschool transcript, class schedules and phone messages from Epstein's home that showed \nhe knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's \nlawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls character by showing they had chatted on \nmyspace.com about smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide \nwhether the victims - and Epstein - were credible. \nUltimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the \nplea agreement left Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein \nhad been convicted at a trial, he could have been sentenced to anything from probation to \n15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek said, adding that the \nrecommended guideline sentence was 21 months. \nEpstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically \nrequired of sex offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court \nsupervision, who will ensure Epstein is in fact being treated? \nThe plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was \nwarranted, how does dropping it before completion benefit the public? \nEpstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his \nlawyers bought him the protection the state attorney owed to the victims. \nNew York Post — 07/27/2008 \nNew York Post - New York, N.Y. \nDate: Jul 27, 2006 \nStart Page: 014 \nSection: Page Six \nText Word Count: 395 \nIT looks like New York billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein got off easy when he was hit \nwith a charge of soliciting a prostitute for a \"happy ending\" in Palm Beach. \nBecause if Palm Beach police had their way, Epstein, 53 - who surrendered last Sunday \nand is out on $3,000 bail - might have been whacked with far more serious charges of \npaying underage girls for sex. \nBut a state grand jury found the witnesses in the case were not credible and threw out all \nbut the single charge of soliciting a hooker in his luxurious Palm Beach home. Epstein's \nlawyers and friends now say he's the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach Police \nChief Michael Reiter, whom they describe as a \"born-again nut case.\" \nAccording to the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach \nPost, detectives took statements from 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley \nRobson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as \"like a \nHeidi Fleiss,\" says she got naked to give Epstein a massage, then brought him six girls \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021768 \nages 14-16 for massages and sex at his home. She said they were paid $200 per session. \nCops also allege that Epstein's personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been charged, \nset up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied massage oils. \nPolice searched through Epstein's garbage and retrieved sex toys and feminine hygiene \nproducts. \nEpstein's Palm Beach lawyer, Jack Goldberger, told Page Six that the Florida state \nattorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence from a \"one-sided perspective.\" He \nadded that Epstein had passed an extensive lie-detector test in which he was grilled about \nunderage girls. \nEpstein's New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said, \"The prosecutor didn't want to bring \nany charges in this case, but because of the craziness of this police chief, we have the \ncharge of solicitation.\" \nLast night, WPTV in Palm Beach reported that one reason Robson's testimony may have \nbeen dismissed is the kinky Web page she has on MySpace featuring photos of her \nfemale friends playing with sex toys. One friend even uses the name \"Pimpin Made EZ.\" \nRobson, who isn't charged, also writes, \"Do what you do to make that money, life is \na gamble. Stay hustling.\" \nA spokeswoman for Reiter said, \"We think our investigation speaks for itself\" \nCops also allege that [Jeffrey Epstein]'s personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been \ncharged, set up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied \nmassage oils. Police searched through Epstein's garbage and retrieved sex toys and \nfeminine hygiene products. \nEpstein's Palm Beach lawyer, Jack Goldberger, told Page Six that the Florida state \nattorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence from a \"one-sided perspective.\" He \nadded that Epstein had passed an extensive lie-detector test in which he was grilled about \nunderage girls. \nNewYork Post — 09/20/2007 \nJAIL LOOMS FOR SEX-CASE MOGUL \nSeptember 20, 2007 -- THE sordid sex case involving Jeffrey Epstein may \nbe coming to an unhappy ending -with a plea deal that would put the \npublicity-shy billionaire behind bars for 15 months for allegedly soliciting \nunderage teen girls for sex at his Palm Beach mansion. \nSources tell Page Six that Epstein's high-powered lawyers - including Alan \nDershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black and Kenneth Starr - have been \nnegotiating a deal with federal prosecutors who are probing, among other \nthings, whether the gray-haired money manager paid West Palm Beach girls \nfor sex or transported them across state lines. Epstein is currently charged by \nthe State of Florida with soliciting young prostitutes for sex - but federal \ncharges would be far more serious. \nThe Palm Beach Post reported yesterday that Epstein is very close to a deal \nwith the feds that would send him to jail for 11/2 to 2 years. Sources tell us that \nwhile a deal has not yet solidified, what's under discussion is a guilty plea to \nat least one charge in exchange for a sentence of 15 months in a Florida state \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021769 \nprison, followed by 15 months of home confinement. That would be a fraction \nof the time he would have to serve if he were to be convicted by a jury. \nEpstein's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said his client would have no \ncomment. Dershowitz also declined to comment late yesterday. \nPalm Beach police records show that on March 15, 2005, a 14-year-old girl \nalleged she had visited Epstein's estate, where she partially stripped and \ngave him a massage during which he \"pulled out a purple vibrator\" and used it \non her in exchange for $300. A further probe uncovered five young women \nwho said Epstein had masturbated and touched their genitals during \nmassages, the records state. A woman named Haley Robson - who \ndescribed herself as \"like a Heidi Fleiss\" - later admitted bringing six girls \nbetween the ages of 14 and 16 to Epstein's house, according to cops. \nDespite the allegations, Epstein was only nailed on a single charge of \nsoliciting a hooker - but it sparked a federal probe. Epstein's lawyers and \nfriends have insisted he was the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach \nPolice Chief Michael Reiter, whom they described as a \"born-again nutcase.\" \nPalm Beach Post - 08/14/ 2006 \nPolice chiefs reputation helps discredit attacks \nBy Larry Keller \nPalm Beach Post - Monday, August 14, 2006 \nIn the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are \naccused of wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter. \nEpstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution \nsolely because of Reiter's \"craziness,\" one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department \ndisseminated \"a distorted view of the case\" and behaved in a \"childish\" manner when the \ngrand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another Epstein lawyer \ncomplained. \nTo hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the \nsheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce. \nReiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, (NAME REMOVED), last year, after 24 \nyears of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go \nto mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is \nparticularly ugly. \nReiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorneys office for two \nreasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of \nsexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt \nlanguage seldom used by one law-enforcement official concerning another because of \nwhat he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case. \nIn a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case \"highly \nunusual.\" He added, \"I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to \nrequire your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases.\" In short, Reiter told \nthe county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. \"It \nlooks like a departure from professionalism,\" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021770 \nFernandez Rundle said of Reiter's letter. \nFollowing Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether \nthe super-rich, super-connected defendant had violated any federal laws. Reiter won't \ndiscuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one \nword to describe the chief: professional. \n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick \nLincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 \nyears. \"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all \nconsider Mike to be our peer and a man of integrity.\" Juno Beach Police Chief H.C. \nClark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on \ncountywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen \nanything but a professional demeanor from him.\" \nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol \njob at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job \nevaluations. Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a \nresident confined to his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes \nto the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter \nfor shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at \nfault. Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. \nAnd he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the \nlead detective probing the drug overdose death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was \none of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was \ncharged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family \ncompound in Palm Beach. \nReiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach \nAtlantic University, also has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and \nmanagement courses at Harvard. He's been active in countywide interagency law \nenforcement organizations and has a \"top secret\" national security clearance. \n\"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town,\" said \nTown Manager Peter \nElwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes \nmore than $144,000 as the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. He's very \nbusinesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the \nwork,\" Elwell said. \"I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus \nyears.\" \nNew York Times — 09/03/2006 \nQuestions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Sex Case Against Money Manager - \nSeptember 3, 2006 \nBy ABBY GOODNOUGH \nPALM BEACH, Fla. — In the summer and autumn of last year, when most of the \nmansions here stood empty behind their towering hedges, the police stealthily watched \none at the end of a waterside lane. They monitored the comings and goings of its owner's \nprivate jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his trash. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021771 \nThe owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money manager with \nseveral billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the \nPalm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr. \nEpstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her. \nIn sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend \nhad arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein's home and give him massages, usually in \ntheir underwear, in exchange for cash. \nMost of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the \nmassages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They \nidentified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled \nthat his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars. \nMr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with, \nsoliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become \nincreasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised \nquestions about whether Mr. Epstein's prominence won him preferential treatment. \nBy the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much \nmore serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of \nunlawful sexual activity with a minor. \nBut instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state \nattorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a grand jury, \nwhich indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually \nrefer only capital cases to grand juries. \nEven before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had accused \nprosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state attorney, Bany E. \nKrischer, to remove himself from the case. \nIn an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is \nelective, saying the public had been left \"to wonder whether the system tilted in favor of \na wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls who are \nalleged victims of sex crimes.\" \nThe case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial home in \nManhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former President Bill \nClinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for \ngovernor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have \nreturned campaign contributions from him. \nBut Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B. \nLefcourt and Alan M. Dershowitz, a friend of his, to look into the backgrounds of his \nyoung accusers. \nMr. Lefcourt says that the police acted \"outrageously\" and that his client has been \nwrongfully dragged through the mud. \n\"He disputes that he ever had sex with any under-age person or anything like that,\" said \nMr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart and Abbie \nHoffman. \nNeither the police nor the state attorney's office would discuss the case in detail. But the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021772 \npolice released a thick report on the 13-month investigation after the indictment was \nunsealed in late July. \nThe police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately after \nthey were contacted by the stepmother of the 14-year-old, who, according to the report, \nwas in a special school for students with disciplinary problems. \nThe girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had \"offered her an \nopportunity to make money\" and had driven her to Mr. Epstein's house one Sunday. The \nfriend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college student, told \nthe girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said. \nThe girl told the police that Mr. Epstein's assistant had led her upstairs to a room with a \nmassage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove her clothes. She \nsaid Mr. Epstein had masturbated as she massaged him, had pressed a vibrator against her \nunderwear and had given her $300 afterward. \nIn October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr. Epstein had \nroutinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then interviewed a total \nof 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar stories about what they \nhad observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein's home. According to the report, at least \none said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse with her. \nMr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with Mr. \nEpstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown up for \ngrand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie-detector test clearing \nhim of any sexual involvement with under-age girls. \nA spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police went to \nMr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein. \nInstead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a grand jury to \nexamine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring. \nAround that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors to share \ninformation about the accusers, including statements they had posted on MySpace.com, \nthe social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol. According to the report, \nMr. Krischer's office then decided to delay the grand jury session for several months. \nThe Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May 1 the department \nasked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein. \nChief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning \"the unusual course that your office's \nhandling of this matter has taken\" and suggesting that Mr. Krischer disqualify himself. \nChief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his spokeswoman would not \nsay explicitly why he had urged the prosecutor to step aside. \nMike Edmondson, a spokesman for Mr. Krischer, said the state attorney's office \nsometimes sent noncapital cases to grand juries when there were questions about witness \ncredibility. Mr. Krischer does not recommend a particular charge in such cases, Mr. \nEdmondson said, but gives the grand jury a list of possible charges. \nBruce J. Winick, a law professor at the University of Miami, said that while prosecutors \nin Florida rarely referred noncapital cases to grand juries, they sometimes did so with \nsensitive cases to be extra-cautious. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021773 \nMr. Lefcourt said the police were wrong to have released the report so soon, especially \nwithout correcting information that later proved wrong. He cited his assertion that one \naccuser had lied about her age, adding that she had also been arrested on drug charges \nand had been fired by her employer for stealing. \n\"What I'm trying to focus on,\" Mr. Lefcourt said, \"is, What's motivating the selective \nand misleading release of information to the public?\" \nCopyright 2006 The New York Times Company \nNew York Times — 06/30/08 \nFinancier Starts Sentence in Prostitution Case -NYTimes.com Page 1 of 4 ge 1 of 4 \nJuly 1, 2008 \nFinancier Starts Sentence in Prostitution Case \nBy LANDON THOMAS Jr. \nThe bad news arrived by phone last week on Little St. James Island, the palm-fringed \nXanadu in the Caribbean where Jeffrey E.
