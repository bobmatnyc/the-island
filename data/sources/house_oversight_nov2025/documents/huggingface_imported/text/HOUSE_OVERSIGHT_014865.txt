with president at his estate

By Annie Linskey GLOBE STAFF APRIL 07, 2017

WASHINGTON — For former Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz and his

wife, their recent dinner at the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida was a chance to dine

and catch up with old friends. Then President Trump showed up.

“Everyone stood up and clapped,” recalled Dershowitz, who lives in South Florida

during the Massachusetts winters.

Toward the end of the evening, Trump stopped by the table for an extended chat,
but not about the Trump-branded chocolate cake. The mogul-turned-president
wanted to discuss the prospects for Israeli and Palestinian peace with Dershowitz,

who is well-known for his hawkish, pro-Israel views.

“He pulled me aside,” Dershowitz recalled. “He wanted to talk to me privately

about the Middle East.”

straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

The March 18 encounter provides a window into the free-wheeling and

unconventional policy making employed by Trump, who prizes spontaneity. As a

business tycoon, he liked to keep an open schedule that allowed for impromptu
meetings; it’s a style difficult to replicate in the White House but can work among

the handpicked people who frequent Mar-a-Lago.
