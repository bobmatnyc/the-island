There were two changes made last friday: $4mm of RA and \nArtspace losses can/shld reduce the 3.8% medicare tax and $7mm of TRA payments shld also be exempt from \nmedicare taxes (consistent with prior year APO and Akin Gump advice). In aggregate this increases our \noverpayment by $400k. \nPls call me and I'll find rich and tom if you want to discuss. Thx, b \nOtherwise, taxes are complete and we are ready to press the button and file electronically.
