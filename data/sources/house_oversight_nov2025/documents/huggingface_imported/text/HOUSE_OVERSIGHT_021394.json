  "text": "design or intent, seem to arise from\nbehaviors and interactions at a lower\nlevel of organization. How this can\ncome about is a puzzle, but it is a puzzle\nthat is amenable to thoughtful\ninvestigation, both scientific and\nphilosophical. What forces are at play,\nwe might ask, that makes such a\ncollection cohesive? Just what\nchemistry can transform a collection of\nindividuals into something both more\nthan and different from what in\naggregate they bring to the table? We\nseek to understand more fully the bonds\nof marriage, family, friendship, or\nmembership—invisible forces that bind\nand simultaneously transform the\nunderlying nature of their constituents\nno less than chemical bonds transform\natoms of hydrogen and oxygen into\nwater.\n\nOur origin was rooted in distaste\nfor the unproductive and unenlightening\nshouting matches between proponents of\nviews of science that denigrate religious\nbelief and views of religion that are anti-\nscientific. We started from the\nassumption that scholars from the\nsciences and from religion and\nphilosophy could have fruitful\nconversations about what is known, what\ncounts for knowledge, what can be\nobserved, and what can be tested\nthrough experiment and observation.\nAnd we all believe in the value of the\nscientific method as a means for\nexpanding our knowledge. Internal\ntension is needed for the structural\nintegrity of buildings and bridges, and\nthat is no less true of social structures\nsuch as our network. Through\nappropriate construction, deep tensions\nbetween theology and science (or even\nbetween scientific disciplines or\ntheological perspectives) that have the\npotential to drive us apart can instead be\n\n148\n\nPage\n\nshaped to release creative energy and\nshared purpose.\n\nBerntson notes that “beliefs and\nemotions have consequences, both\nbehavioral and physiological.” The\nnetwork starts from the premise that one\ncan learn about such apparently invisible\nphenomena as beliefs by studying and\nreasoning about their consequences.\n\nIn his essay, Browning advocates\nstarting with a critical hermeneutic\nphenomenology, a “careful description”\nof our instruments, our observations, and\nthe stories we use them to tell. Clearly\narticulating our assumptions and starting\npoints has been of immense value. After\ndoing so for the benefit of colleagues\noutside our disciplines, those colleagues\nin turn have helped us become aware of\nunarticulated assumptions implicit in our\napproaches or in our experiments.\n\nThese observations have led in turn to\nbetter science and more convincing\nevidence. Our colleagues in the network\nhave helped each of us to see more\nfacets of the same elephant that\nindividually we are too blind to\nappreciate fully.\n\nRevising our thinking and our\nresearch to take those observations into\naccount has increased the rigor of our\nthought and broadened the scope of our\nconclusions. The presence of a rich\nvariety of disciplinary perspectives has\nhelped us to weave the nets of Sir Arthur\nEddington’s parable more tightly,\nenabling us to see for the first time some\nof the “smaller fish” that earlier would\nhave escaped our notice.\n\nShedding light on invisible forces (a\nkoan)\n\nInvisible forces of culture,\nconnection, and curiosity bind us\ntogether and define us as a species that is\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021394",
