  "text": "Saturday Night Live featured “Lyndon LaRouche Theater,” in\nwhich Randy Quaid played LaRouche, with a bald wig, bow-tie\nand spectacles, narrating melodramatic twists, conspiracies, and\n\nconfessing “Il am insane.”\n\nNot mentioned in the book, near the end of March 1981, |\ndelivered a keynote address at the Youth International Party\nconvention in New York. These were the latterday Yippies,\noriginally launched as the anti-Yippie “Zippies” during the\n1972 both conventions in Miami. | asked the audience a\nrhetorical question, “How would you like to be a Secret Service\nagent guarding Ronald Reagan, Knowing that his vice president,\nGeorge Bush, is the former head of the CIA?”\n\nOnce again, satire would be outdistanced by reality. On\nMarch 30, the president was shot by John Hinckley in order to\nmake a favorable impression on actress Jodie Foster so that he\ncould take her bowling on a date. Ironicallly, Hinckley came out\n\nfor gun control, and Reagan came out against it.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031757",
