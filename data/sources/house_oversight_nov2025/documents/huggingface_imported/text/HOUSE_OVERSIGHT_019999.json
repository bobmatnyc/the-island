  "text": "—attributing Russian aggressiveness to a new cold war. Remnick, the editor of the New\nYorker, had, since the Trump election, propounded an absolutist view that Trump’s\nelection imperiled Democratic norms.\n\nThis 13,500-word story—handily connecting the dots of Russia’s geopolitical\nmortification, Putin’s ambition, the country’s cyber talents, Trump’s own nascent\nauthoritarianism, and the U.S. intelligence community’s suspicions about Putin and Russia\n—codified a new narrative as coherent and as apocalyptic as the one about the old cold\nwar. The difference was that in this one, the ultimate result was Donald Trump—he was\nthe nuclear bomb. One of the frequently quoted sources in the article was Ben Rhodes, the\nObama aide who, Trump’s camp believed, was a key leaker, if not one of the architects of\nthe Obama administration’s continued effort to connect Trump and his team to Putin and\nRussia. Rhodes, many in the White House believed, was the deep state. They also believed\nthat every time a leak was credited to “former and current officials,” Rhodes was the\nformer official who was in close touch with current officials.\n\nWhile the article was largely just a dire recapitulation of fears about Putin and Trump,\nit did, in a parenthesis toward the end of the article—quite burying the lead—connect\nJared Kushner to Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, in a meeting in Trump Tower with\nMichael Flynn in December.\n\nHicks missed this point; later, it had to be highlighted for the president by Bannon.\n\nThree people in the Trump administration—the former National Security Advisor, the\ncurrent attorney general, and the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law—had now been\ndirectly connected to the Russian diplomat.\n\nTo Kushner and his wife, this was less than innocent: they would, with a sense of\ndeepening threat, suspect Bannon of leaking the information about Kushner’s meeting\nwith Kislyak.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nFew jobs in the Trump administration seemed so right, fitting, and even destined to their\nholder as Jeff Sessions’s appointment as the nation’s top law enforcement officer. As he\nviewed his work as AG, it was his mandate to curb, circumscribe, and undo the\ninterpretation of federal law that had for three generations undermined American culture\nand offended his own place in it. “This is his life’s work,” said Steve Bannon.\n\nAnd Sessions was certainly not going to risk his job over the silly Russia business, with\nits growing collection of slapstick Trump figures. God knows what those characters were\nup to—nothing good, everybody assumed. Best to have nothing to do with it.\n\nWithout consulting the president or, ostensibly, anyone in the White House, Sessions\ndecided to move as far as possible out of harm’s way. On March 2, the day after the Post\nstory, he recused himself from anything having to do with the Russia investigation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019999",
