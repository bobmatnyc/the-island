The chart below represents a deep dive we did on the new world of Chinese banking. Companies\nlike Zhong An, WeBank and Lufax will grow dramatically and will take advantage of (as well as\nsupport) the massive worlds of Alibaba and Tencent. Together, Alibaba and Tencent have market cap\nof $500 bn. Popping up in many of these areas of overlap are Ping An and CICC. They are\nstrategically placed to make great strides in China. This is slowly being recognized in the case of Ping\nAN (See Page 8 of attached PPT). Ping An's market cap is $97 bn. It is connected to Zhong An.. It\nowns 44% of Lufax. And some if its management were the very ones that started WeBank. It is\nperfectly positioned for the coming boom in new banking. It has the best combined ROA and ROE\nglobally and its P/E of 10x is trading on a 50% discount to the global averages. Why is Ping An\ntrading at a discount to AIA? BUY PING AN -- SELL AIA..\n\nB. The other company which has the best return on capital of any broker dealer -- and is also\n\npositioned nicely for the coming boom in the new era of banking in China -- is CICC. CICC and CDH\n(a CICC breakaway) both invested in Zhong An and Lufax. CICC has vision and a proven track record.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026037",
