You never stop being a person's lawyer.\"\n\nBackground: Dershowitz helped Epstein get a sweetheart plea deal from then-U.S. Attorney\n\nAlexander Acosta (now Donald Trump's labor secretary and a rumored long-shot contender for attorney\n\ngeneral).\n\n¢ A bombshell Miami Herald investigative series last week highlighted for the first time the extent of\n\nEpstein's alleged crimes and the soft treatment he received from federal prosecutors.\n\n¢ The Palm Beach multimillionaire would \"serve just 13 months in the county jail, but the deal —\ncalled a non-prosecution agreement — essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether\nthere were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein’s sex crimes,\"\naccording to a Miami Herald examination of thousands of emails, court documents and FBI\n\nrecords.\n\nhttps:/Awww.axios.com/alan-dershowitz-jeffrey-epstein-legal-advice-1a13ad59-a718-46c9-981 3-11231604a387.html 1/3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018016",
