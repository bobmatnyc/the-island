  "text": "assassination of Anwar Sadat on a calm afternoon in October 1981. Wisner arrived a\nfew years later. Though not quite a friend, Wisner had cultivated a directness at\nleast, with Mubarak. He’d become a mirror in which the Egyptian president might\nsee how different stances towards America or Israel would appear to the rest of the\nworld. So when, in the winter of 2011, the White House saw Mubarak facing waves\nof unimagined protest, ata moment when it looked like the Egyptian president\nwould become the latest head of state to topple amidst the accelerating discontent\nthat would be known as the Arab Spring, they sent Wisner with a message for\nMubarak: No killing - and it is time for you to retire.\n\nWisner later recalled the tension of Cairo when he arrived. The city felt nervous ina\nway he’d not seen before. He landed in the early morning and went almost\nimmediately to see the President. The situation would be brought back to normal,\nMubarak assured Wisner. Soon. He’d fired most of his cabinet a few days earlier. He\nhad promised reform, and had begun studying what might be done first, and how\nsoon it might be carefully attempted. He hinted to Wisner that the rumored\ntransition of power to his son Gamal was not, after all, inevitable. But, Mubarak said,\nhe wasn’t going anywhere just now.\n\nWisner tried another tack: He asked if the President would like to leave the country.\nMaybe a trip for medical treatment? Mubarak dismissed the idea. He’d seen worse,\nhe reminded Wisner. Mubarak had been sitting inches away from Sadat on that\nfateful October day in 1981. He himself had survived six assassination attempts. In\nfact, he said he intended to go on television again that very evening. He would speak\ndirectly to the protestors. He would tell them and the Egyptian people of his plans\nfor reform and for a gradual transition of power. He would remind them of the\ngreatness of their national spirit. He would evoke the immensity of their ancient\nhistory. And he would be sure they understood that he would stay, he would die on\nEgyptian soil. You can tell that to the White House too, Mubarak told Wisner. He\nvouchsafed, at the end of their talk, at least some of the assurances the envoy had\ncome to collect: No violence. A graceful departure at some point. Elections, even. But\nall on his timetable.\n\nAround Mubarak in those days, Wisner recalled, he saw bafflement. Resolution\nadmixed with surprise. These men in that Egyptian power structure, all wealthy and\ncomfortable and perfectly secure, had thought their places impregnable. They were,\nafter all, the thin human line between the modern world and the boiling mad Islamic\nfundamentalists who hungered to rule the country. They'd arrested the usual\ndissidents, closed down the normal channels, checked with their informants.\nNothing. The old, reliable vents for unrest hadn’t worked. The pressures grew. It\nwas perhaps easy to understand why they thought they’d survive. They'd never\nfailed. Mubarak had been president for 30 years. For now, at least, the syllogistic\nlogic fluttering through the President’s own arguments reassured them: Egypt\nwants stability. Only I can deliver stability. Therefore, Egypt wants me.\n\nWisner left the Presidential Palace. He reported what he’d learned back to\nWashington and, work done, headed to the airport. That evening he found himself\n\n60\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018292",
