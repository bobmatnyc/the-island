  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n833\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nwith the opportunity to clarify their claims\nagainst Al Rajhi Bank, the Burnett Plain-\ntiffs do not offer facts to support their\nconclusions that Al Rajhi Bank had to\nknow that Defendant charities WAMY,\nMWL, IIRC, and SJRC were supporting\nterrorism. See Rule 12(e) Statement\n11 44-60. “[A] complaint which consists of\nconclusory allegations unsupported by fac-\ntual assertions fails even on the liberal\nstandard of Rule 12(b)(6).” De Jesus v.\nSears, Roebuck & Co. 87 F.3d 65, 70 (2d\nCir.1996).\n\nThis Court, like Judge Robertson before\nit, has found no basis for a bank’s liability\nfor injuries funded by money passing\nthrough it on routine banking business.\nSee Burnett [, 274 F.Supp.2d at 109. Sim-\nilarly, allegations concerning the Al Rajhi\nfamily cannot support a claim against Al\nRajhi Bank because there is no allegation\nthat the family members were acting in\nfurtherance of Al Rajhi Bank business.\nTasso v. Platinum Guild Intl, 94 Civ.\n8288(LAP), 1997 WL 16066, at *6\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 1997). Plaintiffs attach\nto their opposition brief a September 2002\nSAMA report summarizing the initiatives\nand actions taken by the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia to combat money laundering and\nterrorist financing. See Burnett Plaintiffs’\nOpp. to Al Rajhi Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 2.\nNeither this document, nor the complaint,\nalleges that SAMA or Al Rajhi Bank im-\nplemented “know your customer” rules\nthat Al Rajhi failed to follow with respect\nto accounts held by the Defendant chari-\nties. Finally, Plaintiffs’ allegations that Al\nRajhi Bank has connections to Hamas sup-\nporters fails to state a claim because Plain-\ntiffs have not alleged any relationship be-\ntween Hamas and al Qaeda or the terrorist\n\n41. The Ashton Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed\nits claims against the Saudi Cement Company\nand the Arabian Cement Company on June\n10, 2004. See 03 MD 1570 Docket # 230.\n\nattacks of September 11. Even accepting\nall the allegations against Al Rajhi Bank as\ntrue, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim\nthat would entitle them to relief. Accord-\ningly, Al Rajhi Bank’s motion to dismiss\nthe Burnett complaint is granted in its\nentirety.\n\n2. Saudi American Bank\n\n[96] Saudi American Bank is based in\nRihadh, Saudi Arabia and was formed in\n1980 pursuant to a royal decree to take\nover the then-existing branches of Citi-\nbank in Riyadh and Jeddah.
