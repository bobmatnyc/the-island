We processed 11 million tweets this week for Trump and 50.03% are\npositive and only 20.66% are negative whereas Clinton is 56.05% negative and 20.03% positive.\n\nWe are trying to correlate that into popular vote outcome and electoral votes received.\n\nRegards,\nZubair\n\nOn Sep 15, 2016, at 5:15 AM, Zubair Kha wrote:\n\nHi Jeffrey,\n\nWe are in the process of removing data from bots and making a clean report which I will share with you in few\nhours.
