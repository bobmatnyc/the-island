Antichrist!” —trying to drown out their chant. “Repent,\nKrishna! People are starving in India every day because these foolish\nKrishnas refuse to eat the cow! Eat the cow and believe in Jesus Christ!\nRepent, Krishna!”\n\nYou can buy all types of stuff along the boardwalk—rainbow\nsunglasses and fake Rolex watches and falafel-shaped yo-yo’ s. “But,”\ncomplains a flower vendor who pays $600 a month for a ten-by-two-foot\nSpace, “rent will be going up to $800 and then to $1200 by summer.\nVenice will eventually be inhabited by a bunch of wealthy lot owners and a\npopulation of slaves who work for them.”\n\nHowever, the performers pay no rent, dependent on voluntary\ndonations.
