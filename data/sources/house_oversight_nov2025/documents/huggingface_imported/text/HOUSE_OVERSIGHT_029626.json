Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers were just a few of the\nprominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive only aslap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year\nsentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr,\nGuy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice?\n\nEpstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe\nhttp://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork\n\nHedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last week. But it appears his problems\nmay not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that:\n\nUnder the concept of double jeopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges covered by his non-prosecution\nagreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of incarceration, fund the civil suits of named victims, and register as a sex offender.\n\nThe victims who accepted cash settlements in these civil suits agreed not to testify against him or speak publicly about the case. However,\n\nnew evidence developed by the Department of Justice on other offenses not covered by the agreement, including allegations by additional\nSTE SCORES eee, There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-trafficking law, which was also\n\nenacted by the state of Florida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls,\nthere may well be more evidence to uncover. (Several young women who claim to be Epstein victims have recently contacted a Ft.\nLauderdale lawyer, but to date no new civil complaints have been filed.)\n\n* Conchita Sarnoff: The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den\n\n* Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free\n\nThese new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about Epstein’s pattern of sexual contact\nwith underage girls, which Palm Beach police began investigating in 2005 and the U.S. Attorney’s office then settled in a 2007 plea deal.\nThe first article quoted a deposition by then-Palm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter, in which he stated that Epstein, a billionaire with\nmany powerful friends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his incarceration. Although federal\ninvestigators at one point produced a draft 53-page indictment against Epstein, he was eventually allowed to plead guilty to only two\nrelatively minor state charges and receive a short term of incarceration: 13 months in the county jail, during which he went to the office\nevery day, and one year of community control, during which he traveled frequently to New York and his private island in the Virgin\nIslands.\n\nThe Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which Epstein apparently received special consideration: Asaconvicted sex\n\n. This is because child molesters tend to be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According to a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029626",
