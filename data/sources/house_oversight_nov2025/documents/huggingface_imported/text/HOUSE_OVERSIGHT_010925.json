  "text": "city planning. It became clear that all but the third needed better math skills than |\nhad. So I bought the Barnes and Noble textbook on College Mathematics, got through\nit in a week of hard work, and then began on the Johnson and Kiokemeister textbook\non calculus along with Halliday and Resnick on physics. Together they took me\nnearly a year. At the end, I was allowed to sit in on the freshman physics finals at Cal\n\nBerkeley, where the same two textbooks were taught.\n\nIt was the finals for physics majors, and meant to be tough. Cal took physics\nseriously. Not every freshman was destined to go farther. Some should be steered\ntowards engineering, which pays better anyhow. There were 10 questions. Three\nhours were allowed. Each of us had a calculator and nothing else. Not even a table of\nintegrals. My God. I had to remember them or rederive them. There are some that\nhad taken even Newton and Leibnitz months to solve. I don’t remember any of the\nquestions. There were 200 to 300 kids in the room. Maybe 20 or 30 orientals, about\nthree women, no blacks. Not one finished early. And some figure to be Nobelists by\nnow. We're talking about Cal. | had answered seven questions when the three hours\nwere up. Was that good enough? | got a call in a few days. I passed, and beat the\n\nclass average.\n\nMy old friend Matt Kelly warned me about this time that George was in trouble. Matt\nhad known George’s new wife Jackie, and had been invited to dinner there. Matt’s\nimpression was of out-of-control mood changes. He said that George at one point\nhad drawn him aside, shown a pistol and warned him about paying too much\nattention to Jackie. The next minute they were back at the table in jolly spirits. I\nlearned later what was wrong. George thought he had a weight problem, although |\nnever noticed one. Doctors prescribed amphetamines in those days to control\nappetite. They revved him up and made it hard to sleep at night. So the same doctors\nprescribed barbiturates at night to get him to sleep. Uppers and downers are\n\ndangerous enough. Add a drink or two and you've got trouble.\n\nOf course I should have told my father. But I didn’t want to be the one. I liked to\n\nboost my brothers. Many must have seen the symptoms Matt saw.
