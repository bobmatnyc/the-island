They want him out, together with the\nhate figures around him who have been conducting the brutal\nrepression of the protest movement. But he is not stepping down. He\nintends to stay on -- and to fight on.\n\nAsad gave no ground to his political enemies. The speech was not, in\nfact, addressed to them. It was addressed to Syria’s ‘silent majority’\nwhich -- or so the President continues to believe -- aspires to security,\nstability and national unity, and is terrified, above all, of a sectarian\nwar on the Iraqi model.\n\nThe President explained that, in order to understand the nature of the\ncrisis, he had held several meetings in recent weeks with citizens\nfrom all parts of the country. He wanted to hear directly from them.\nThe conclusion he had reached was that there were several different\ncomponents to the protest movement.\n\nFirst, there were those who had legitimate demands, who wanted\njustice, democracy and jobs, and the resolution of problems which\nhad accumulated over decades. Their demands could not be ignored.\nHe intended to address them and had already started to do so. But\nthen there were the others -- the criminal outlaws, the blasphemous\nintellectuals who spoke in the name of religion, the vandals,\nconspirators and paid agents of foreign powers. Under cover of the\nprotest movement, they had taken up arms against the state!\n\nThese conspirators, he said, had called for foreign intervention, they\nhad smeared Syria’s image and destroyed public and private property.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030167",
