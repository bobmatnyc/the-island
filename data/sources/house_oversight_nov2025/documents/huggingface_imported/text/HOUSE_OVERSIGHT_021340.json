And every now and then,\n\ncomputers can have a mind of their own.\n\nHaving the capacity to reason\nabout other minds enables people to\nform deep social connections with\nothers, to empathize with others’ pain\nand share in their joy, and to anticipate\nothers’ actions. But having a capacity\nand actually using it are two different\nthings. People are not naturally inclined\nto see invisible things in the\nenvironment. People do not\nautomatically see into other minds,\neither, but instead do so only under\ncertain circumstances and with some\npsychological effort. This chapter will\ndescribe how people come to see other\nminds, how other minds can become\nmore or less visible, and why the\nvisibility of other minds matters for\neveryday life.\n\nKinds of Minds\n\nStudying how people understand\nother minds first requires understanding\nhow people intuitively define another\nmind. Research suggests that people\nthink of minds as having two distinct\ndimensions, the ability to act (agency)\nand the ability to feel (experience)’.\nMindful agency involves the cognitive\nactivities that enable action, such as the\ncapacity to plan, to have intentions, to\nengage in deliberate self-control, and to\npursue one’s own goals. Conscious\npreferences, attitudes, and beliefs follow\nfrom these capacities. Mindful\nexperience, in contrast, involves the\ncognitive activities involved in reacting\nto the external world, such as the\ncapacity for self-awareness, and the\nexperience of basic psychological states\n(like hunger, thirst, or pain), and other-\noriented emotions (such as empathy or\nsympathy). Mindful experience also\n\nPage |94\n\ninvolves the capacity for\nmetacognition—the capacity to think\nabout one’s own thoughts or emotions—\nexemplified in experiences such as\nconfidence and doubt, or in secondary\nemotions such as shame, guilt, joy, or\nhope. People seem to represent these\ntwo capacities in others quite\nindependently. A sociopath, for\ninstance, can appear to act with a high\ndegree of mindful agency but no mindful\nexperience, whereas a baby might appear\nfull of mindful experience with\nrelatively little mindful agency. Seeing\nother agents as mindful essentially\nmeans seeing them as able to\nconsciously think and/or to feel.\n\nBecause you are aware of both your own\nthoughts and feelings, you likely\nconsider yourself—like most people\ndo—to be very mindful.\n\nMaking Other Minds Visible\n\nIntrospection provides a kind of\nflashlight that seems to provide direct\naccess to one’s own agency as well as\nexperience. Although research\ndemonstrates that introspection is\nactually a process of indirect inference,\nit appears to us that introspection\nprovides direct access to the workings of\nour own brain. It seems that we can look\non the inside and fee/ when we are\nsuffering, know when we are\nexperiencing regret, or be aware of our\nintentions to lose weight. We can use\nour introspective abilities to make\ninferences about what others are likely\nthinking or feeling (and we very often\ndo), but such inferences are likely to\nseem inherently less direct, less\nimmediate, and less illuminating. We\ncannot see into other minds as clearly as\nwe seem able to see our own.\n\nWhen something is difficult to\nsee, people may doubt whether it\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021340",
