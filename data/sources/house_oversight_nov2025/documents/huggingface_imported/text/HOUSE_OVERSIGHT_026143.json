  "text": "Ukrsib bank\n\nI have considered a number of banks (Appendix I) and given my experience in the\ncountry, Ukrsib is my top choice for the following reasons:\n\n«= Image of a European reliable, ethical, healthy bank with good electronic\nbanking solutions (Top 5 in 2017) servicing first class corporate customers and\ntheir employees. The shareholders comprise BNP Paribas (60%) and EBRD\n(40%).\n\n= Good coverage ratio of problematic loans, a practice of French banks we have\nobserved in many occasions with recent experience in Greece with Credit\nAgricole and Soc Gen.\n\nThe NPL ratio is 31% (EUR 301 million), less than the 36.4% average for\nbanks with foreign capital, and coverage of around 80%. From the 2016 audited\nannual accounts, the remaining 20% net of reserves NPL portfolio is covered 4\ntimes by collateral. The most problematic loans population has been that of\nmortgages in foreign currency and it seems that Ukrsib has provisioned this part\nadequately.\n\nMortgage Other Consumer Overdraf Other Total\ns mortgages loans ts loans\nNeither past due nor\nimpaired\nHigh grade 0.2 5 0.1 508 513.\n3\nMedium grade 0\nLow grade 4 4\nWithout ranking (up to 1 1 3 21 7 13.3 45.3\nyear)\nWithout ranking (1-10 20 3 20 0.1 3 46.1\nyears)\nWithout ranking (more 45 5 50\nthan 10 years)\nTotal neither past due 66.2 15 41 7.2 529.3 658.\nnor impaired 7\nPast due but not\nimpaired\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026143",
