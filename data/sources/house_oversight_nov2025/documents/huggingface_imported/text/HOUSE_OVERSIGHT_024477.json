  "text": "6. RISK FACTORS\n\nInvestment in the Units involves a substantial degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. Asa\nresult, the purchase of the Units should be considered only by persons who can reasonably afford a loss\nof their entire investment. Prospective investors should carefully consider, in addition to matters set forth\nelsewhere in this Memorandum, the following factors relating to the business of the Company and this\noffering. The order in which risk factors appear is not intended as an indication of the relative weight or\nimportance thereof. Prospective investors should carefully review all risk factors. Such information is\npresented as of the date hereof and is subject to change without notice. The discussion in this\nMemorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results\nmay differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-locking statements. Factors that could\ncause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited fo, those discussed below. The\noccurrence of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of\noperations or cash flow. Risks described herein that could affect KLC are also likely to be similar for other\npre-K-12 businesses we may acquire or develop. Other businesses we acquire or develop in foreign\ncountries or in different markets, may be subject to risks in addition to those discussed below.\n\n6.4. Risks Related to Our Business\n\n6.1.1 Risks associated with growth through acquisitions; potential inability to\nconsummate transactions\n\nAprincipal component of the Company's growth strategy is the acquisition of other businesses or interests\ntherein that will complement and/or expand the Company's businesses and the products and services that\nthey offer. The successful implementation of this strategy will depend upon a number of factors, including\nthe ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, consummate such transactions on favorable\nterms and integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the Company. Identifying,\ncompleting and realizing on attractive acquisitions are highly competitive and involves a high degree of\nuncertainty. The Company will be competing for acquisitions with other companies, private equity firms,\nas well as individuals and others, which often results in increased acquisition prices. There can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or that if identified,\nthe Company will be able to consummate such transactions on suitable terms, or that acquired\nbusinesses will perform as expected or generate returns.\n\nIn addition to risks facing education companies similar to those facing KLC as described herein,\nacquisitions of businesses also involve special risks, including risks associated with unanticipated\nliabilities and contingencies, diversion of Company management attention and possible adverse effects\non earnings resulting from increased amortization of goodwill, increased interest costs, the issuance of\nadditional securities and difficulties related to the integration of the acquired business. No assurance can\nbe given as to the success of the Company in executing and integrating acquisitions in the future. The\nCompany's failure or inability to successfully implement and manage its acquisition strategy would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and business.\n\nThe Company may from time to time enter into negotiations in anticipation of consummating an\nacquisition transaction. However, there is no assurance that such negotiations will be successful and the\ndiversion of management attention on such unsuccessful transactions may adversely affect\nmanagement's ability to pursue other business opportunities.\n\nin addition, KLC PropCo intends to acquire diversified real estate interests, including investments in non-\neducation related properties. The performance of this acquisition strategy in general, or of any particular\nproperty, cannot be predicted.\n\n44\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024477",
