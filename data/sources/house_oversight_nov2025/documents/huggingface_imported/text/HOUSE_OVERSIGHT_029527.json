George, the plaintiff attorney, said SARC’s founder is now either\n\nin Vietnam or Australia.\n\nWalsh's success in getting foreign backers on board for the planned Palm House\nproject, according to the SEC’s complaint, was largely based on lies made to\n\nunsuspecting investors who believed the project carried minimal risk.\n\nIn bold font, one marketing brochure claimed that the EB-5 investor money would\nonly be used for 43 percent of the project’s total costs while the rest would be covered\nby a $29 million loan from a “reputable bank” and $22 million in equity from the\n\ndeveloper.\nNone of that was true.\n\nSARC also claimed the investors’ funds would be held in an escrow account at PNC\nBank until their green cards had been approved by USCIS and that the money\n\nwouldn't be touched until then.
