On the primary endpoint, 20 mg/kg Epidiolex produced a median reduction in\nmonthly drop seizures of 42% compared to a reduction of 17% in patients taking\nplacebo, p=0.0047. There was also a suggestion of a dose response in the data, with the\nlower 10 mg/kg/day dose of Epidiolex producing a median reduction in monthly drop\nseizures of 37%, p=0.0016. In both dose groups the difference between Epidiolex and\nplacebo emerged during the first month of treatment and was sustained during the\nentire treatment period. GW disclosed that the trial's secondary endpoints, and a series\nof sensitivity analyses, confirmed the robustness of the results. Similar to Epidiolex's\nother Phase Ill studies, although patients on clobazam (51%) had some additional\nbenefit, GW indicated that Epidiolex also showed efficacy in patients not on clobazam.\n\nFigure 126 GWPCARE3: Responder Analysis\n\na\n\nut ¥\na4 t\nA a5\n530 ;\n3\n3 25 .\nBa} :\nFas Ty\n3\"\n25\n\nTreatment Period (Primary)\n\nMaintenance Period\n\nra Treatment Period 70 Maintenance Period\nMCBD 20 mglig (n=78) sen 94 — a ;\nCBD 10 mgikg(n=73) ——tpet).005 60 ‘pens eo pa\nPLB (n=78) a §pe0.001\n50 50 F\nBaseline median (@1, Q3) drop seizure frequency: =\nCBD 20 mg/kg: 88 (38, 162) -* 7: hi :\nCBD 10 mglkg: 87 (41, 190) fs & '\nPlacebo: 80 (48, 148) * : - a\n2 20 .\nEstimated treatment differences vs placebo a i ‘ti 13\n* CBD 20 mg/kg: -21.6 (25% Cl: -34.8, -6.7) : i\nCBD 10 mg/kg: -19.2 (95% Cl: -31.2, -7.7) a en oH ae g == = =e\n\n@ CBD 20 mg/kg (n=/6) CBD 10 mg/kg (n=73) PLB (n=76)\n\nSource: GW Pharma, AAN 2017\n\n90\n\nSource: GW Pharma, AAN 2017\n\nAdditional data were presented at AAN 2017. Included in this presentation were several\n\nof the trial's secondary endpoints and a series of sensitivity analyses. All of these\nconfirmed the robustness of the results. For example, the proportion of patients witha\n>50% reduction in seizure frequency was 40% for 20 mg/kg Epidiolex (p<0.001), 36% for\n\n10 mg/kg Epidiolex (p<0.01), and 15% for placebo. The proportion of patients with a\n>75% reduction in seizure frequency was 25% for 20 mg/kg Epidiolex (p<0.01), 11% for\n10 mg/kg (p<0.05) Epidiolex, and 3% for placebo. The proportion of patients who\n\nachieved seizure freedom was 7% for 20 mg/kg Epidiolex, 4% for 10 mg/kg Epidiolex,\n\nand 1% for placebo.\n\nFigure 127 GWPCARES3: Safety\n\nCBD 20 mg/kg (n=82)\n\nCBD 10 mg/kg (n=67)\n\nPlacebo (n=76)\n\nmi (%) mi (%) ni (%)\nAl-causality TEAEs 7?
