  "text": "around-the-world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged\nfor her. Some are, or have been, his romantic interests.\nHis present girlfriend, whom he met four years ago at a\ndinner party in New York, is in dental school. One\nformer girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish\nmodel and Miss Universe finalist whom Epstein has\nknown for more than thirty years, became a doctor—\nEpstein sent her to medical school—and married hedge\nfunder Glen Dubin. Together they finance the Dubin\nBreast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. Most of the\nwomen at one time will travel with Epstein to his other\nfloating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, a vast\napartment in Paris, the island in the Caribbean, the\nhouse in Palm Beach.\n\nEpstein will sometimes move a meeting in his\ndining room outside to the park—his idea of going out\nto lunch is a Sabrett’s hot dog—with the various girls in\nthe house the accompanying entourage, as though\nsomething out of an 18th-century French court.\n\nBut the Hefnerian prurience can also be quite\nbusinesslike: poised young women in a mansion on the\nUpper East Side with various office responsibilities are\nreally not that different from any of the art galleries in\nthe surrounding neighborhood. They mingle freely with\nhis powerful guests, not so much as hostesses—or, in\ntabloid language, harem-like “sex slaves”—but as\nattentive students (which, of course, might be regarded\nas having its own fetish-like attraction). Epstein\nexplicitly denies that there is an sexual quid pro quo.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022900",
