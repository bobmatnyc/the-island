  "text": "Director Andrew McCabe would confirm statements made by James\nComey about how the president had tried to intimidate him. In\nresponse, the President began a campaign of harassment, threats, and\nintimidation against McCabe. On March 16, 2018, after McCabe testified\nbefore Congress, the President, in retaliation, caused his dismissal and\nthe loss of his pension.\n\nThe Mueller team may have a high hurdle in convincing\nRosenstein to approve the indictment. The Department of Justice's\nstanding view precludes charging a sitting president with a crime.
