To abstract away from the details,\nwhat these processes are about is:\n\ne taking the general dynamic of compound-formation and reduction as outlined in Kampis\nand Chaotic Logic\n\ne introducing goal-directed pruning (“filtering”) into this dynamic so as to account for the\nlimitations of computational resources that are a necessary part of pragmatic intelligence\n\n3.4.3 The Dynamic of Iterative Analysis and Synthesis\n\nWhile synthesis and analysis are both very useful on their own, they achieve their greatest power\nwhen harnessed together. It is my hypothesis that the dynamic pattern of alternating synthesis\nand analysis has a fundamental role in cognition. Put simply, synthesis creates new mental\nforms by combining existing ones. Then, analysis seeks simple explanations for the forms in the\nmind, including the newly created ones; and, this explanation itself then comprises additional\nnew forms in the mind, to be used as fodder for the next round of synthesis. Or, to put it yet\nmore simply:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012962",
