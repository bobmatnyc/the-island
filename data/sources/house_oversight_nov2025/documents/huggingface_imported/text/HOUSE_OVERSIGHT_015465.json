  "text": "NAUTILUS EDUCATION | BETA PRODUCT\n\nAstronomy & Space Travel\n\nHow would we travel nearly five light years? This article explores different engineering solutions\nto the puzzle of taking a very, very, long trip, intertwiming science-fiction goals with real world\nsolutions. Students will explore fanciful applications of Newton’s second law, and concepts of\nmomentum, ions, and nuclear fusion.\n\nLesson Plan\n\nReview vocabulary words in class. Have students read the article and answer the reading comprehension ques-\ntions for homework, as well as generate a discussion question of their own. In class, address any conceptual\nquestions that the class might have. Have students write discussion questions on the board, along with the ones\nsuggested in this document. Have students break up into small groups, each of which should address one of the\ndiscussion questions. 15 MIN\n\nDedicate the remaining class time to completing one of the activities. 30-45 MIN\n\nTeacher’s Notes: Roadmap to Alpha Centauri\n\nVOCAB WORDS\n\nMagnetic field: produced by a magnetic material or a Nuclear fusion: when two or more clusters of neu-\ncurrent, a magnetic field will push or pull a moving trons and protons collide, forming a new nucleus and\ncharge or magnet that comes in contact with it. releasing energy.\n\nTon: an atom in which the number of electrons and\n\nprotons is unequal—thus, the atom is positive or\nREADING COMPREHENSION\n\nnegative.\n. What does AU stand for?\nMomentum: the product of the mass and velocity of meeo’s sane\nan object. 2. How fast is Voyager 1 moving in miles per hour?\nRecoil: the backward momentum from a fired gun. 3. “The engine first strips propellant atoms [typi-\n\ncally xenon] of their outermost electrons.” What\n\nPlasma: one of the four fundamental states of matter, . .\nis the charge of a stripped xenon atom?\n\ncomposed of ions and electrons.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015465",
