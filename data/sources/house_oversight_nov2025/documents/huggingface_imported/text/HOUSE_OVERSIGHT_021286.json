  "text": "The Status of the Body Politic and the\nStatus of the Body Itself\n\nIn the long history of\nconversations between science and\nreligion, starting points matter. As Don\nBrowning demonstrates through the\nexample of Thomas Aquinas, when\nreligions start with a desire to understand\nhuman behavior, such as the long-term\nhuman commitment between parent and\nchild, they recognize that science might\nilluminate and refine that understanding.\nAnd religion, in turn, might shape social\ninstitutions that not only enhance the\nhuman drive toward social connection\nbut also imaginatively extend its\ninfluence beyond direct kinship to\ninfluence ethical relations with neighbor\nand stranger. By starting with a shared\ninterest in understanding what Browning\ncalls “the rudimentary energies of\nhuman morality,” creative conversation\nbetween science and religion thus\nprompts a religious humanism, in which\nreligion partners with science to shape\nmodels of fulfillment for human\nsociality.\n\nLike Browning, Louise Hawkley\nstarts with the human quest for social\nconnection. As humans mature,\nHawkley observes, they proceed from\nchildhood dependence not toward\nindependence but toward\ninterdependence. But, whereas\nBrowning pursued the implications of\ninterdependence for the body politic,\nHawkley wants to know the\nconsequences of interdependence for the\nphysical body. Her research focuses on\nthe interplay between psychological and\nphysical factors in the human sense of\nsocial connectedness, and Hawkley finds\nthat “feeling wanted and accepted and\nlike one belongs are as vital to our\nexistence as the air we breathe. “ A\nrobust sense of social connection\n\nPage |40\n\nreverberates throughout the human body,\nand its absence—in loneliness—is likely\nto have long-term adverse effects on\npersonal health.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021286",
