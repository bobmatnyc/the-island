However, the Euro debt crisis\npersists, and further reform and consolidation efforts in Spain and Italy are needed. In the\nUS, economic data weakened recently, but it remains in line with our forecast of moderate\ngrowth of around 2% in 2012. The Fed extended \"Operation Twist\" until the end of the\nyear and is ready to do more if the economic situation deteriorates materially. Meanwhile,\nChinese activity data is showing signs of stabilization and inflation remains low. We expect\nthe Chinese economy to gradually pick up in the second half of 2012.\n• Equities\nDespite our relatively positive outlook for US and Chinese economic growth, ongoing\nEurozone issues keep us neutral on global equities. We think US companies are better\npositioned than their European peers, and thus keep our longer-standing preference for\nUS equities. US earnings are relatively robust and the recovery of the domestic economy\ncontinues to support revenues. Furthermore, we keep a moderate overweight in emerging\nmarket (EM) equities as valuations are attractive and we expect growth to accelerate in\nthe second half of the year. In the near term EM currency weakness remains a risk factor.\n• Fixed Income\nHigh grade government bond yields remain extremely low due to ultra-expansive\nmonetary policy and ongoing investor concerns over global growth. While we expect\nyields to only rise very gradually in the near term, we continue to see better investment\nopportunities in other fixed income segments. US high yield remains our favorite asset\nclass, given attractive valuations and a favorable default outlook. We also keep our\noverweight recommendations on investment grade and EM bonds.\n• Commodities\nWe avoid broad commodity exposure as we see further price weakness ahead. While the\nworst of the oil sell-off is likely behind us, we see no reason for higher prices in the near\nterm and expect roll costs to weigh on positions.\n• Foreign Exchange\nIn light of the ongoing Eurozone troubles, we continue to prefer the US dollar over the\neuro. We also prefer the Canadian dollar, given its relatively good growth dynamics, a\npossible rate hike, and relatively high short rates.\n3\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nCross-asset preferences\nMost preferred\nLeast preferred\nPortfolio weights\nEquities\n• US\n• Western winners from EM\ngrowth\n• High quality dividend yields\n• Event-driven and relative value\nhedge funds\n• Natural gas growth gainers\n• Europe\nCommodities\n3%\nReal Estate\n5%\nHedge Funds /\nPrivate Equity\n10%\nEquities USA\n10%\nLiquidity\n10%\nHigh Grade\nBonds\n6%\nInv Grade\nCorporates\nBonds\n9%\nHigh Yield\nBonds\n6%\nFixed income\nForeign\nexchange\n• US high yield\n• Global investment grade credit\n• Event-driven and relative value\nhedge funds\n• EM corporate bonds\n• USD\n• GBP\n• CAD\n• Developed market\ngovernment bonds\n• CHF\n• EUR\nEquities\nEurope\n20%\nEmMa Equities\n6%\nEquities Other\n9%\nEmerging\nMarkets Bonds\n6%\nNote: Portfolio weights are for an advisory\nclient with a \"EUR moderate\" profile.

Historically, dividends have made a substantial\ncontribution to total returns, and we expect this to remain the case in\nthe current environment.\n• Western winners from emerging market growth (sourced from\nexisting equity holdings)\nEmerging economies continue to grow faster than developed\neconomies. With little need to deleverage and repair balance sheets,\nAsian economies are also well positioned to continue to outpace their\nWestern peers in the years ahead. We have identified companies from a\nvariety of sectors in Europe, the US and Japan which have significant\nexposure to the rapidly growing emerging regions. We believe a\ndiversified portfolio of these companies will reward investors seeking\nto profit from the robust demand growth in emerging economies.\n• Natural gas growth gainers\nNatural gas is a relatively clean source of energy, and we think it will\nbenefit from continued substitution for other energy sources over the\nlong term. We have examined the dynamics of the global market and\nthe various components of the gas value chain, and identified the areas\nwe see as the most significant beneficiaries currently. These include\nproducers in Europe and Asia, suppliers of infrastructure, services and\nrelated machinery, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) in the US,\nthat offer both attractive yields and growth.\n• Government bond alternatives (sourced from government bonds\n–CIO UW)\nDeveloped world government bonds offer a comparatively small cushion\nagainst future interest rate hikes and many face increasing credit risk. We\nexpect select bonds of supranational or national agencies, sub-national\ngovernments, multinational corporates, and covered bonds to\noutperform government bonds. We recommend switching out of\ngovernment bonds into these alternatives.\n• US high yield corporate bonds (sourced from government bonds –\nCIO UW)\nPositive economic growth, robust corporate earnings and healthy\nbalance sheets provide support to US high yield corporate bonds. Current\nyield spreads of roughly 660 basis points still price in a much more dire\neconomic outcome than we expect. Historically, US high yield bonds have\ndelivered similar returns to US equities with lower volatility. We continue\nto believe that US high yield corporate bonds represent a more favorable\nrisk/return potential than equities and expect total returns of\napproximately 7% over the next 6 months.\n• The place to be in Hedge Funds\nRecent economic data has shown signs of improvement, but growth in\nmost developed markets remains muted. In this environment, less\ndirectional hedge fund strategies, such as relative value and event driven,\nshould offer above average returns.\n• EM corporates: a growing asset class (sourced from global\ngovernment bonds – CIO UW)\nGiven our relatively constructive current view on risk, we regard EM\ncorporate debt as more attractive than EM sovereign debt due to its\nhigher overall yield. Over a 6-month horizon, we expect EM corporate\nbonds to outperform US Treasuries and deliver total returns of close to\n8% p.a.\n6\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nGlobal economic outlook\n–\nSummary\nKey questions\n• Can emerging markets (EM) continue to offset developed market (DM) weakness to buoy global\ngrowth?\n• What are the risks of near-term faltering of the US economic recovery?\n• When is the European economy likely to return to sustainable economic expansion?\nCIO View (Probability: 60%*)\n• Global economic activity remains moderate; the growth impulse stems largely (some 80%) from the EM\nregion. As expected, China started to ease monetary policy. The country is better placed than other EM\nand particularly DM countries to counter growth weakness with further monetary and fiscal stimuli. Thus,\nwe expect EM growth to stabilize soon and pick up in 2H 2012.\n• US economic indicators have on balance been disappointing recently, especially data related to business\nfixed investment and employment growth. Thus, we lowered our 2Q 2012 real GDP growth forecast to an\nannualized rate of 1.5% from 2%. We still expect growth slightly above 2% in 2H 2012. We think that the\nrisk that the Fed will take measures in addition to the extension of \"Operation Twist\" is still significant.\n• Large parts of Western Europe are in recession or stagnation. We expect the economies of the Eurozone\nand the UK to show mild improvement in 2H 2012. Still, economic activity is likely to remain very sluggish\ndespite support from lower oil prices and less rigorous fiscal austerity. The Bank of England may support\nthe UK economy by increasing its amount of bond purchases soon. The probability that the ECB will take\nfurther action to support the economy has risen significantly.\n� Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*)\n• The Eurozone crisis abates. Financial market conditions recover, mitigating the drag from fiscal austerity.\n• Growth in Western Europe is marginally positive (Eurozone stagnates) in 2012 and the US economy\ngrows moderately above trend.\n� Negative scenario (Probability: 25%*)\n• There are three key downside risks to the global economy: 1. a significant escalation of the Eurozone\ndebt crisis; 2. a sharp fiscal contraction in the US, and 3. a sharp deceleration of the Chinese economy. Each\none of these risks could precipitate a significant downturn of the global economy.\nKey dates\n2 July USA: ISM manufacturing PMI for June\n5 July Eurozone: ECB press conference\n24 July Eurozone: purchasing managers indices (PMI), July estimates\n22–25 July China: HSBC flash manufacturing purchasing managers index (Jul)\nGlobal growth expected at just under\n3% in 2012\nSource: UBS CIO, as of 28 June 2012\nGlobal economic momentum is\ndeteriorating (UBS GDP tracker)\n14\n%\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2Jan\n-4 05\n-6\nJan\n06\nJan\n07\nReal GDP growth in % Inflation in %\nJan\n08\nJan\n09\nGlobal DM EM*\n2011 2012F 2013F 2011 2012F 2013F\nAmericas US 1.7 2.1 2.6 3.1 2.1 1.7\nCanada 2.4 2.1 2.4 2.9 2.1 2.3\nBrazil 2.7 2.0 4.8 6.5 5.2 6.5\nAsia/Pacific Japan -0.7 2.5 2.0 -0.3 0.2 0.5\nAustralia 2.1 3.7 3.5 3.4 1.6 2.5\nChina 9.2 8.2 8.5 5.4 3.0 4.0\nIndia 6.5 6.0 7.0 7.8 6.9 7.0\nEurope Eurozone 1.5 -0.4 0.4 2.7 2.3 2.0\nGermany 3.1 1.0 1.1 2.5 1.7 1.5\nFrance 1.7 0.3 0.4 2.1 2.5 2.2\nItaly 0.5 -1.8 0.2 2.9 3.4 3.9\nSpain 0.7 -1.6 -1.3 3.1 1.9 1.9\nUK 0.7 0.2 1.3 4.5 2.8 1.9\nSwitzerland 2.1 1.3 1.7 0.2 -0.4 1.4\nRussia 4.3 3.8 3.7 8.5 4.9 6.9\nWorld 3.2 2.8 3.3 3.9 3.0 3.0\nIn developing the CIO economic forecasts, CIO economists\nworked in collaboration with economists employed by UBS\nInvestment Research.

The Troika may only\naccept moderate adjustments to the second Greek package. Portugal is likely to receive an increased\nbailout package and is unlikely to default in 2012. Progress on reforms and consolidation in Spain and Italy\nis most crucial for the near-term development of the crisis. Risk premiums would rise strongly on any\nfailure to meet deficit targets; we expect bond risk premiums to remain elevated for Spain and Italy over\nthe next six months.\n• Following stagnation in 1Q 2012, economic surveys are commensurate with a quarterly GDP contraction\nof around 0.3% at present. Business survey evidence points to a general wait and see mode. The risk to the\noutlook for a stabilization of economic growth in the second half of 2012 is skewed to the downside. The\nECB remains on hold, but the bar to support the economy and markets has been lowered substantially. We\nsee a significant probability of policy action in early July, including the possibility of a rate reduction.\nDespite all the talk about political measures to support growth and increased tolerance for budget\nslippages, there is practically no leeway for fiscal stimuli. The near-term growth impact of any fiscal\nmeasure will at best be marginal, in our view.\n� Positive scenario (Probability: 15%*)\nReturn to macro stability\n• Bond yields are contained, as peripheral countries' budgets stay on track and economic activity recovers\nfaster than expected. Greece fully complies with the austerity plans and receives further support. Market\nconfidence is restored, and economic growth stagnates in 2012.\n� Negative scenario (Probability: 20%*) Major shock\n• Major shocks could include Spain being pushed into a full IMF/EU program, possibly by a rating cut to\njunk, enhancing pressure also on Italy; serious political disagreement in core countries (for instance after\nDutch elections, etc.); a possible Portuguese default; a Greek euro exit; or a major external growth shock.\nKey dates\n5 July ECB press conference\n9–10 July Eurogroup/ECOFIN-Meeting\n24 July Eurozone purchasing manager indices (PMI), July estimates\nBottoming in Eurozone leading\nindicators (PMI) in June?\n65\n60\n55\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS CIO, as of 21 June 2012 (estimates)\nYield of Spanish and Italian 10-year\nbonds over German Bunds (in bps)\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n06 07 08 09 10 11 12\nManufacturing Services Composite\n0\n01/2011 04/2011 07/2011 10/2011 01/2012 04/2012\nItaly Spain\nSource: UBS CIO, Bloomberg, as of 18 June 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n* Scenario probabilities are based on qualitative assessment.\nFor further information please contact CIO analyst Thomas Wacker, thomas.wacker@ubs.com and\nCIO economist Ricardo Garcia, ricardo-za.garcia@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n8\nKey financial market driver 2 –\nUS policy\nKey questions\n• Will the economic outlook deteriorate? Will QE3 become necessary?\n• How will the election outcome change fiscal policy deliberations?\n• Can politicians find an agreement to avoid sharp fiscal contraction in early 2013 (\"fiscal cliff\")?\nCIO View (Probability: 65%*)\nNo QE3, political gridlock and some fiscal tightening\n• The economy stays on a moderate growth path, coupled with stable core PCE inflation close to the Fed’s\ntarget of 2%. UBS forecasts real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2Q 2012 (consensus: 2.1%) and 2.3% in 3Q 2012\n(consensus: 2.4%), with some downside risk due to rising uncertainty. The Fed has decided to extend so\ncalled \"Operation Twist\" until the end of the year. More near-term monetary easing is still possible, but it\nis currently not our central scenario.\n• In the elections, Republicans will likely lose seats in the House overall, but retain a majority; we also\nexpect them to win a narrow majority in the Senate. Obama will likely retain the White House. Such an\nelectoral outcome would confirm the existing gridlock between Republicans and Democrats.\n• Against the backdrop of ongoing political gridlock, we expect only moderate fiscal tightening of about\n0.9% of GDP in 2013. The government will likely let unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut expire,\nbut postpone income tax hikes and sequestration spending.\n� Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*) No QE3, Democratic sweep and more fiscal tightening\n• Propelled by ultra-expansive monetary policy and improved confidence, cyclical forces surmount the\nstructural hindrances and thus growth accelerates. More rapid growth leads to higher inflation, and the\nFed responds by tightening monetary policy sooner.\n• The improved economic outlook raises the odds for an Obama re-election and makes it harder for\nRepublicans to win a majority in the Senate. US fiscal consolidation efforts are facilitated by faster rising\ntax collections. A Democratic stronghold leads to some tax hikes and limited spending cuts. Fiscal policy\ntightens by about 1.2% of GDP in 2013.\n� Negative scenario (Probability: 25%*) QE3, political dysfunction and huge fiscal tightening\n• Structural hindrances dominate and weigh on the cyclical recovery, thus growth weakens or turns\nnegative. The Fed embarks on QE3, most likely in the form of agency MBS and Treasury purchases.\n• Weaker economic conditions raise the odds for a larger Republican majority in Congress, but Obama\nremains President. The debt limit is reached earlier and the Treasury runs out of money before year-end.\nThe political gridlock becomes dysfunctional, thus fiscal policy tightens by USD 600 billion (3.7% of UBS\nestimate of 2013 GDP) in 2013 (“fiscal cliff”). The US credit rating is downgraded.\nKey dates\n2 July ISM manufacturing PMI for June\n6 July Nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rate for June\n6 Nov US Presidential and Congressional elections\nUS moderate growth to continue\nUS real GDP and its components, quarter-over-quarter\nannualized in %\n8%\nq/q annualized\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\n-2%\n-4%\n-6%\n-8%\n-10%\n-12%\nQ1 2006 Q1 2007 Q1 2008 Q1 2009 Q1 2010 Q1 2011 Q1 2012\nConsumption\nCapital expenditures\nInventories\nGovernment\nSource: Thomson Datastream, UBS CIO, as of 20 June 2012\nUS fiscal cliff at year-end 2012\nCommercial real estate investment\nResidential investment\nNet Exports\nReal GDP (q/q annualized)\nFiscal effects of change in provisions under current law, USD\nbillion annualized\nUBS CIO\nforecasts\n1Q13 2Q13 3Q13 4Q13 CY2013\nSequester automatic cuts\n(discretionary spending) -60 -68 -76 -76 -70\nSequester automatic cuts (mandatory\nspending) -16 -16 -16 -17 -16\n2001/2003 tax cuts (250k+ incomes,\nestate tax) -38 -58 -58 -65 -55\n2001/2003 tax cuts (middle incomes) -164 -156 -137 -172 -157\nAlternative Minimum Tax (incl.\ninteraction with tax cuts) 0 -374 -125 -29 -132\nPayroll tax cut -94 -114 -114 -114 -109\nEmergency Unemployment\nCompensation -34 -34 -34 -34 -34\nAffordable Care Act (3.8%/0.9% tax\non passive/wage income 250k+) -27 -27 -27 -27 -27\nTotal (all provisions) -433 -847 -587 -534 -600\nSource: Goldman Sachs, UBS CIO, as of 20 June 2012\n* Scenario probabilities are based on qualitative assessment.\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n9\nFor further information please contact US economist Thomas Berner, thomas.berner@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nKey financial market driver 3 –\nChina growth outlook\nKey questions\n• When will the economy bottom out?\n• What economic policy responses can we expect to support the economy ahead?\n• How significant is the contagion risk from a possible downturn in the Eurozone?\nCIO View (Probability: 70%*) Modest policy easing to support growth in 2H12\n• The latest economic data suggest that economic activity is showing signs of stabilization, albeit at a\ncomparatively low level. However, we have yet to see meaningful pick-up in activity. We think that policy\nmeasures to support the economy should have more visible effect on activity in the second half of the\nyear.\n• To this effect, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has recently cut interest rates by 25bps – the first such\nmove since late 2008. With investment demand still sluggish, we don't expect the measure to have a\nsignificant near-term effect on growth. Still, the cut confirms the leadership's commitment to support the\neconomy. Importantly, with the rate cut, measures were announced to increase the banks' ability to set\ninterest rates, which should bolster private household spending power in the future.\n• The rate reduction took place against a backdrop of falling price inflation. Thus, inflation is no obstacle\nfor further measures to ease monetary policy. However, at this point we don't expect further rate cuts this\nyear; especially since increased interest rate flexibility should contribute to an easing of monetary\nconditions ahead. If anything, we think the PBoC may implement more reductions in banks' reserve\nrequirement rates to ensure sufficient liquidity provisions. Thus, we think the real focus has to be on the\nfiscal policy measures now, including possibly an acceleration of infrastructure investments, measures to\nsupport consumer spending and selective relaxation in the property market (while keeping home-purchase\nrestrictions intact).\n� Positive scenario (Probability: 20%*) Higher-than-expected growth\n• Chinese GDP grows above 8.5% in 2012. For this we would probably need to see stronger-than-expected\nfiscal and monetary policy support from the government. A speedy improvement in the Eurozone debt\ncrisis could also lead to this positive scenario.\n� Negative scenario (Probability: 10%*) Hard landing\n• Chinese GDP growth below 6%, i.e. a hard landing of the economy. This could be triggered by a global\nfinancial crisis/recession, causing a slump in Chinese exports. Other risks include a sharp decline in Chinese\nresidential property prices – which would slow investment growth, a large-scale default of local\ngovernment debt, or a surge in inflation that forces the PBoC to significantly tighten monetary policy.\nKey dates\n1 Jul Manufacturing purchasing managers index (Jun)\n13 Jul Fixed asset investment, industrial production (Jun), 2Q12 GDP\n11–15 Jul New bank lending, M2 (Jun)\n22–25 Jul HSBC flash manufacturing purchasing managers index (Jul)\nFirst interest rate cut since 2008\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS CIO, as of 18 Jun 2012\nPick-up in infrastructure investment\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS CIO, as of 18 Jun 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n* Scenario probabilities are based on qualitative assessment.\n10\nFor further information please contact CIO analyst Gary Tsang, gary.tsang@ubs.com, Glenda Yu, glenda.yu@ubs.com, Patrick Ho, patrick-ww.ho@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nSection 2\nAsset class views\nSection 2.A\nAsset class views\nEquities\nEquities overview\nGlobal equity markets – Key points\n• We keep an overall neutral allocation to equities (see summary on slide 3).\n• The US remains our preferred developed market. The domestic economy is expected to continue to\ngrow. This should underpin earnings growth for US companies. With labour costs in check, profit margins\nshould stay around the current high levels.\n• We keep our overweight position on EM equities. Monetary easing in key countries continues, and\nrelatively attractive valuations remain key supporting factors. However, near-term economic and currency\nweakness remains a major concern for investors – especially those domiciled in hard currency regions (e.g.\nUSD, EUR). Until year-end, we expect some growth acceleration and therefore stay overweight.\n• The UK remains a preferred market. It offers a solid earnings outlook compared to other European\nmarkets. Moreover, the valuation is attractive at a trailing P/E ratio close to 10.\n• We keep our negative stance on Eurozone equities. The economy remains very weak affecting\nearnings growth negatively. The sovereign debt crisis remains a major risk (see page 8).\n• We remain cautious on Australian equities. The earnings prospects are still being revised down by\nanalysts. The domestic economy is moving at two speeds with the strong part getting its impulse from the\nmining sector. We maintain a small underweight.\n• We keep a moderate underweight in Swiss equities, as valuation looks expensive relative to world\nequities. The negative earnings impact of the strong Swiss franc should ease further in coming quarters.\nGlobal equity sectors – Key points\n• Consumer Staples and Healthcare remain preferred among defensive sectors, as their long-term\nearnings prospects are very solid. Both sectors also offer strong balance sheets, exposure to favorable\ndemographic trends and emerging markets.\n• We keep our negative view on Telecom and Utilities. Both sectors suffer from weak revenue growth\nas well as margin pressure.\n• Within cyclical sectors, we keep our preference for IT due to a solid earnings outlook and strong\ncorporate balance sheets. Moreover, we reiterate our neutral allocation to Industrials.\n• Valuations are high and earnings expectations are optimistic for Consumer Discretionary. However,\nwe reduce our Underweight as we become more positive on the sector in the US.\n• Following the latest oil price decline and a good relative performance, we have reduced our\noverweight on Energy. However, the earnings outlook remains solid and valuation is very attractive.\nWhile Materials are not expensive, we are neutral, as margins remain under pressure.\n• The earnings outlook for US and Asian Financials is solid, which leads us to be neutral on Financials\nfrom a global perspective. However, we maintain our underweight on Eurozone Financials, where\nsovereign indebtedness and bank capitalization remain major concerns.\nPreferences (6 months)\nNorth\nAmerica\nEurope\nAPAC\nEM\nUS\nCanada\nEMU\nUK\nSwitzerland\nSweden\nAustralia\nHong Kong\nJapan\nSingapore\nGlobal EM\nNote: Preference in hedged terms (excl. currencies)\nConsumer Discretionary\nConsumer Staples\nEnergy\nFinancials\nHealthcare\nIndustrials\nIT\nMaterials\nTelecom\nUtilities\n-- neutral\n++\nnew\n-- neutral ++\nnew\nold\nold\nSource: UBS CIO, as of 28 June 2012\n13\nFor further information please contact CIO asset class specialists Markus Irngartinger, markus.irngartinger@ubs.com, or Carsten Schlufter carsten.schlufter@ubs.com.\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nUS equities Preference: overweight\nS&P 500 (27 June): 1,332 (last month: 1,319)\nUBS View S&P 500 (6-month target): 1,430\n• US firms on average show more resilient earnings than their global and especially European peers.\nModest domestic economic growth supports US companies' revenue and thereby earnings growth. About\ntwo thirds of revenues are generated in the US.\n• While profit margins are slightly higher than their average over the last 30 years, we expect them to hold\nup in coming quarters. Pressure from rising wages on margins is rather muted.

After the elections in\nGreece, progress on the reform program will be closely monitored. Spain and Italy will also remain in the\nspotlight with levels of government bond yields too high for being sustainable.\n• With the sovereign debt crisis dragging on we expect the Eurozone market to stay highly volatile in\ncoming months.\n• Economies in peripheral countries increasingly feel the burden of austerity. The economic weakness\naffects company earnings negatively. Analysts' earnings growth forecasts (consensus) for 2012 have come\ndown to about 3% for this year, but we see this as still too high against the weak economic backdrop.\n• All in all, the ongoing risks stemming from the sovereign debt crisis lead us to the view that Eurozone\nequities will underperform other major markets.\n� Positive scenario Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 275\n• Global economic growth reaccelerates and Eurozone growth shows clear signs of bottoming out,\nenabling 2–4% earnings growth over the rest of the year.

An expected improvement in the global economy\nover the coming quarters should support UK companies as 70% of revenues are generated abroad.\n• Energy is the largest sector of the UK market. While the oil price eased sharply over the past months, we\nexpect it to stabilize in the second half of 2012. An attractive valuation of the energy sector at 6.5x trailing\nearnings provides some buffer for earnings volatility going forward.\n• Profitability of UK banks is reasonable. They are less affected by the sovereign debt crisis than their\nEurozone peers. While the recent easing of collateral requirements by the Bank of England is supportive in\nthe short-term, the profitability of the domestic operations could be negatively affected by the\nimplementation of the ring-fencing bank reform by 2015.\n• UK equities’ P/E, at about 10.0x trailing, indicates attractive value relative to global equities. Based on our\n12-month forward earnings growth estimate of about 5% and the P/E multiple slightly expanding to 10.3x,\nwe expect UK equities to show good returns over the next six months.\n� Positive scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 6,650\n• Continued global growth and strong demand from emerging markets should support demand for\ncommodities, helping the Materials and Energy sectors to lead the market higher. The market could re-rate\nto a P/E multiple of close to 12.0x, and we would expect earnings growth of 5–8% over 12 months.\n� Negative scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 4,400\n• A global recession drags UK earnings down by 15–20%.

Consequently,\nthe Swiss equity market is affected by the recent weakening in global growth.\n• Swiss companies try to mitigate concerns on the global economic prospects by maintaining tight cost\ncontrols. This should allow to maintain relatively robust operating margins in 2012.\n• While the Swiss franc remains overvalued, we expect the currency impact to gradually become less of a\ndrag. In fact, at current exchange rates, Swiss companies' earnings would show some positive currency\ntranslation effects by end 2012, compared to the previous year.\n• Still, the PE-ratio of the market is relatively high compared to the global average, indicating less\nattractive value. The SMI is trading at about 12.8x realized earnings. We are thus more cautious on the\nability of the market to deliver further multiple expansion in a challenging market environment. As a\nresult, we maintain a small underweight stance on Swiss equities.\n� Positive scenario SMI (6-month target): 6,900\n• Eurozone economic growth reaccelerates meaningfully, providing relief to Swiss financials as well as\nSwiss exporters. Defensive sectors would likely be left behind in a relief rally. In this scenario, we would\nexpect the equity market P/E to re-rate to 14x and earnings to grow by 5% over the next six months.\n� Negative scenario SMI (6-month target): 5,075\n• The sovereign debt crisis re-escalates, leading to further downside for Swiss financials and the exportfocused\nIndustrials and Materials sectors.

This exceptional high growth is\nmainly due to the two natural disasters last year, as well as tax regulation changes which caused a\nnumber of one-time losses to be booked in the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.\n• In our base case scenario, we see only limited scope for an additional earnings boost from the local\neconomic recovery, given the slowing in export markets. Japanese companies are expected to continue\ntheir cost reduction efforts to counter the impact of a strong yen.\n• The Japanese government has started implementing its JPY 18tn recovery budget in 4Q 2011, and we\nexpect the budget to boost Japanese GDP by 1–1.5% in FY2012.\n• Mainly due to the earnings rebound, we expect the TOPIX trailing P/E to drop from around 16.5x to 14x\n– 14.5x by year end; still the earnings rebound should provide some room for moderate price increases.\n� Positive scenario Topix (6-month target): 900\n• Stronger global demand and stabilizing European markets provide an additional boost to earnings, and\nalso lead to improved risk taking. Falling risk aversion is likely to lead to a weaker yen, providing further\nupside to earnings. TOPIX target is based on 16.0x trailing P/E.\n� Negative scenario Topix (6-month target): 600\n• Faltering global growth leads to weak exports, triggering negative earnings surprises. A strengthening\nUSDJPY below 75 in response to rising risk aversion might provide an additional drag on the economy and\nearnings.

We\nexpect EM FX to appreciate against the USD from current levels over a six-month horizon.\n• As expected, China has started to ease monetary policy. We believe there is also room to do more on the\nfiscal side, helping to support China's economic growth outlook for the second half of 2012 and into 2013.\nThe 2Q GDP numbers are expected to represent the low point in the current cycle.\n• Given the above, in our base case, we see scope for some multiple expansion for the MSCI EM Index,\nfrom the current 10.3x realized price-to-earnings ratio to closer to 11x over the next six months. We expect\nearnings growth of around 10% over the next 12 months.\n• Within EM, we believe that Asia is best positioned for economic growth in the second half of 2012. In\nemerging Asia, we prefer China. In Latin America, we prefer Brazil and Mexico. Central and Eastern\nEurope remains the most vulnerable region, and we remain neutral on Russia.\n� Positive scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 1,190\n• The outlook for the global economy improves, boosting EM's ability to grow more strongly in 2013.\nStronger economic growth leads to earnings growth of 15%. Investor confidence improves, leading to a\nbetter P/E multiple of 12.5x trailing earnings. More cyclical Korea and Taiwan would benefit.\n� Negative scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 730\n• Serious negative developments (e.g. a further deterioration of the Eurozone crisis, the US fiscal cliff, or a\nChinese hard landing) hit trade and thus the economic prospects of emerging markets. In this case, we\nwould expect a 25% decline in earnings. More defensive Malaysia would do better, whereas more cyclical\nKorea and Taiwan would underperform.

Hong Kong should benefit\nfrom China's gradual recovery in 2H 2012, while Singapore's economy is rebounding and corporate\nbalance sheets and earnings remain solid. After the rate cut early June, we expect China to have more\npolicies to support growth in 2H 2012. China is our most preferred market, while Indonesia is least\npreferred in the region. We are more concerned about Indonesia's fiscal deficit, since the fuel price hike\ndid not happen. Domestic problems for Indonesia include current account deficits, potential capital\noutflows, bottomed-out inflation and hiccups in economic and market reforms, in our view.\n• We expect 10% earnings-per-share growth over 12 months for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan, which trades on\n11.6x 12-month trailing earnings. We expect this multiple to expand slightly in the next six months, as the\ncurrent earnings downgrade cycle is approaching its end. Nevertheless, MSCI Asia ex-Japan is likely to see\nfurther volatility in the near term due to global macro risk factors.\n� Positive scenario MSCI Asia ex-Japan (6-month target): 610\n• More supportive monetary and fiscal policy, stable inflation, sustained domestic demand growth, and an\nimproved global growth outlook should lead to a better earnings outlook. We would expect earnings\ngrowth of 15% and a P/E based on realized earnings of 14x.\n� Negative scenario MSCI APAC ex-Japan (6-month target): 380\n• A hard landing in China with a global recession leads to negative earnings revisions for 2012.

Within Financials, however,\ninvestors should limit their direct exposure to the Eurozone debt crisis. We assess the cheapness of a stock\nby looking at its price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios relative to its peers.\n• We believe US mid caps will outperform large caps. US economic data is forecast to stabilize and GDP\ngrowth should be resilient in the second half of 2012. Greater domestic sales exposure reduces earnings\nrisk coming from Europe. In Europe, we prefer large over small caps in the current very challenging\neconomic environment.\n• High quality dividend paying stocks provide a real and stable income stream to investors during the\ncurrent low yield environment. Furthermore, they give exposure to the long term potential of equity\nmarkets while also providing some support in declining markets.\n� Positive scenario Prefer value, low quality and small caps\n• Leading indicators continue to move higher, and risks related to the Eurozone debt crisis subside. In this\ncase, add deep cyclical value (cheap price/book, price/earnings) regardless of sector, with high beta and\nhigh leverage. In such an environment, small- and mid-cap stocks should also perform well, but a dividend\nstrategy would be too defensive to outperform the market.\n� Negative scenario Prefer quality and large caps\n• The global economic picture deteriorates markedly. In this case, buy high-quality growth companies and\nlarge caps. Do not look for value opportunities, but be as defensive as possible with your equity exposure.\nLook to high-quality, dividend-paying stocks for yield.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).\nWhat we're watching\nEarnings revisions – see\nchart\n(3-month moving\naverage upgrades vs.\ndowngrades)\nUS and Eurozone PMIs\nWhy it matters\nWatch for signs of continued improvement in earnings revisions (aggregated\nfrom stock level). An improved earnings outlook would cause investors to add\nmore risk, allowing multiples to expand and triggering the outperformance of\nvalue stocks.\nIf PMIs stabilize or improve, value stocks should outperform as there is no longer\njustification to pay the high price for earnings stability (quality). Key dates: 2\nJuly, PMI Manufacturing Eurozone; 2 July, US ISM Manufacturing\nRegional differentiation\n• Within Europe, look for value\nopportunities within each sector, but be\naware of the higher-risk Financials.\n• In the US, there are opportunities in value\nnames that also show strong growth.\n• Within Europe, avoid small caps and\ninstead rotate into large caps.\n• In the US, prefer mid caps to large caps\nwhile GDP growth is above 2%.\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• We expect value strategies to outperform\nthe market significantly over the long\nterm.\n• Mid-cap stocks provide attractive\nopportunities over the longer term.\nEuropean earnings revisions fell hard\nlast year, but the down cycle might be\nbe ending (net revisions, in %; MSCI\nEurope)\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n-10%\n-20%\n-30%\n-40%\n-50%\n-60%\nJun.05 Jun.06 Jun.07 Jun.08 Jun.09 Jun.10 Jun.11 Jun.12\nSource: FactSet, UBS CIO, as of 27 June 2012\nNote: Past performance is no indication for future returns.\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Christopher Wright, christopher-zb.wright@ubs.com 21\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nSection 2.B\nAsset class views\nFixed income\nBonds overview\nGovernment bonds – Key points\n• Government bond yields of major developed markets started to rise from their historical lows ahead of\nGreek elections, in particular with hopes of more Eurozone integration (e.g. Eurobonds or a European\nbank deposit guarantee). The new Greek government has at least eased concerns of an imminent and\ndisorderly Greek exit helping yields in their short term rise. However, further central bank easing,\nincluding the extension of Operation Twist (OT) until end of 2012 by the Fed limited the further upside\npotential in yields over the coming months.\n• Our expectations for bond yields over the coming 6 months remain a marginal rise. Despite recent\nsetbacks in global growth, the world economy remains in expansion mode. However, OT will keep longer\nyields low for longer. Also short-term downside risks to bond yields cannot be excluded; Spain has\nreturned to the spotlight, and challenges in Italy's adjustment programs remain. Given current division\namong European leaders, the mutualization of debt is unlikely to be resolved soon.\n• On a relative basis, we prefer German and Swiss bonds, over those in the US and UK, where bond yields\ncould rise faster due to a sounder economic outlook. In particularly in the US, the cyclical recovery looks\ncomparatively more robust.\n• Declining growth momentum, extension of Operation Twist by the Fed and a rising likelihood of a rate\ncut by the ECB, are likely to keep yields on extraordinary low levels, for the time being. Thus we suggest a\nneutral duration position at this stage.\nPreferences (6 months)\nshort duration neutral\nUSD\nEUR (DE)\nGBP\nJPY\nCHF\nCAD\nAUD\nnew old\nunderweight neutral\nlong duration\noverweight\nCorporate and emerging market bonds – Key points\n• We maintain our preference for corporate credit (both investment grade and high yield) as well as\nemerging market bonds, keeping overweight positions in all three segments.\n• Investment grade (IG) corporate bonds showed remarkable resilience in the latest downturn. The asset\nclass is likely to outperform government bonds in the coming six months, with higher liquidity and lower\nvolatility than HY bonds. We see the highest return potential in the lower-rated IG segment (BBB and A).\n• US corporate bonds of lower credit quality (high yield, HY) remain fundamentally supported by solid\nbalance sheets and a benign US growth outlook. Given the low risk of default losses, valuations are\nattractive at an effective yield of 7.5%. For US HY, we expect high single-digit total returns in the next six\nmonths.

However, Treasury yields remain near historical lows due to the extension of Operation\nTwist (OT) coupled with recent setbacks of domestic economic data.\n• We expect a marginal rise in yields since the US economy remains on a moderate cyclical growth path\nwith the housing market having bottomed out. Additionally the diminished near-term risk of a Greek exit\nfrom the Eurozone following elections supports a gradual rise in Treasury yields.\n• However, over a six-month horizon, the extension of Operation Twist (OT) until the end of 2012 by the\nFederal Reserve (Fed) will limit the upside potential in yields. As of late, the probability of even more\nstimulus in the form of quantitative easing from the Fed has risen substantially and markets have pushed\nout the first rate hike expectation into 2015. Additionally, structural obstacles from the pending US fiscal\nconsolidation will also limit the upside potential for yields. Further, the US economy seems more vulnerable\nto possible spillover effects of increased political uncertainties in the Eurozone.\n� Positive scenario for US bonds US 10-year (6-month range): 1.5–1.7%\n• The European debt crisis further re-escalates. The resulting contagion would intensify the current flight to\nquality, with Italian and Spanish spreads above 550 basis points to the Bund (our base case).\n• With the increased likelihood of further quantitative easing, the risk is that yields would stay low or fall\nlower.\n� Negative scenario for US bonds US 10-year (6-month range): 2.3–2.9%\n• If the EU leaders indicate serious commitment towards more fiscal integration, and US growth proves\nmore sustainable with a rapidly improving labor market, then yields could rise.\n• Recently, market expectations regarding future rate hikes by the Fed have pushed out a first rate hike\ninto 2Q 2015. Any re-pricing into 2014 or 2013 will result in higher yields.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nFed policy The Fed's assessment of the labour market determines it's stance on quantitative\neasing and is key for yields.

However, this rise was muted given the extension of Operation Twist, weak global / German\ndata and Spain's return to the spotlight.\n• Over a three- to six-month horizon, we expect growth momentum to remain subdued but still in positive\nterritory; we should have more information on how Spain and Italy are handling their adjustment\nprograms. Also, the new pro-memorandum Greek government should limit safe haven inflows, and thus\nlimit short-term downside risks to yields.\n• In the UK, economic data continues to be mixed as the recovery continues but is prone to external shocks.\nThe recent liquidity provision announcement by the BoE has confirmed these concerns.\n• In Switzerland, yields have traded range bound owing to conflicting economic data. The SNB stressed\nincreased downside risks to the economy and stands ready to act. However, we believe Swiss yields will\ngradually normalize.\n� Positive scenario for German bonds 10-year Bund yield (6-month range) 1.1–1.3%\n• The European debt crisis re-escalates.

Our spread target of 170bps is based on our benign economic outlook, ongoing investor\nappetite for income-generating assets and expected negative net issuance. This target spread is still above\nits 15-year average of 130bps.\n• Non-financial corporates: While total yields are at record lows, the pickup over government bonds and\nmoney market rates is attractive. Aggressive re-leveraging by companies looks unlikely in the current\nenvironment. Credit quality should remain good and non-financials continue to deliver a stable income.\n• Financial corporates: Due to regulatory challenges, spreads are expected to remain above past averages.\nTotal returns could outpace non-financials, but volatility will be considerably higher.\n• Overall, IG corporate bonds remain a preferred asset class, providing an attractive yield pickup. The asset\nclass offers relatively low volatility and a benign total return outlook. We expect lower-rated issuers (BBB\nand A) to outperform higher-rated ones.\n� Positive scenario Spread target (6-month): 140bps\n• Global growth accelerates more forcefully than expected. This could compress spreads to closer to precrisis\nlevels. Spreads for Financials are likely to remain elevated due to regulatory challenges. However, in\nthis positive case, rising benchmark yields would limit total returns to 1–2% over six months.\n� Negative scenario Spread target (6-month): 400bps\n• Even if US economic growth falters, and the European recession turns out to be worse than currently\nexpected, we believe we would be unlikely to see the spread levels reached in 2009, given companies’\nsuperior balance sheet positions. European financial issuers would be most at risk in this scenario.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nWhat we're watching\nWhy it matters\nRecommendations\nTactical (6 months)\n• We still see room for tighter yield spreads;\nthe return outlook compares very\nfavorably to government bonds.\n• Internationally diversified companies from\nnon-financial sectors offer a stable and\nrelatively safe income stream for\nconservative investors.\n• We recommend bonds from the lower IG\nrating segments (BBB and A) over higherrated\nissuers.\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• We prefer corporate over sovereign assets\ngiven companies' robustness compared to\nthe structural weakness of public finance\nin many countries.\nYield spreads\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\nbps\nCore market yields\nCorporate fundamentals\nNew issuance\nDeveloped market sovereign yields are only expected to increase gradually.

We stick to our spread forecast of 525bps based on an ongoing recovery of the US\neconomy, robust company balance sheets, rising earnings, and ongoing investor appetite for higheryielding\nassets. US HY bonds remain our preferred asset class.\n• Fundamental factors remain supportive. Despite the recent uptick in defaults, in the absence of a\nrenewed US recession only a very gradual increase is to be expected. We forecast a modest rise in the\ntrailing default rate to 3.5% at the end of the year from 3.1% in May. A heavy load of new issuance in the\nfirst three months of the year means that HY companies will be faced with a lower risk of failed\nrefinancing going forward (e.g. in case of an unexpected economic slump).\n• We acknowledge that ongoing risk aversion could still cause spreads to widen somewhat in the short run.\nInvestors who are able and willing to hold on to their HY position will likely benefit over 6 months.\n� Positive scenario USD HY spread target (6-month): 450bps\n• In the positive economic scenario, a rally in high yield bonds and a return to pre-crisis spreads of about\n400bps is likely. Benchmark yields would also rise, limiting HY returns to around 10%. European HY\noutperforms the US.\n� Negative scenario USD HY spread target (6-month): 1,200bps\n• A global recession is a major risk for high yield bonds. Based on the more robust state of the corporate\nsector, we would not expect spreads to widen to 2008/09 peak levels above 2,000bps. Although short-term\nspikes are likely, due to liquidity suddenly drying up, we would expect a quick return to the \"usual\"\nrecession-level spread of around 1,200bps.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nWhat we're watching\nCredit quality/\ndefault cycle\nNew issuance\nBank lending standards\nWhy it matters\nAs long as corporate earnings increase and balance sheets remain backed by high\ncash levels and low debt ratios, the default rate will remain below its 5% longterm\naverage.\nFor now, favorable conditions in the primary market have mainly been used for\nrefinancing.

Key dates: early-July, ECB bank lending survey;\nlate-July, Fed Senior Loan Officer Survey\nRecommendations\nTactical (6 months)\n• US high yield corporate bonds offer an\nattractive return outlook and should be\noverweighted.\n• We prefer US over European issuers given\nthe poorer economic outlook in Europe\nand the increasing proportion of\nperipheral and financial issuers in the\nEuropean HY universe.\n• Inflows into HY mutual funds have been\nstrong so far in 2012, but new issuance has\ncooled down a bit in April and May.\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• We expect US defaults to remain at belowaverage\nlevels for longer.

However, given EM sovereigns'\nbetter average fundamentals, and EM corporates' solid profit growth outlook and low leverage ratios, we\nthink that periods of price weakness should offer attractive entry points.\n• Although we revised our spread targets (to 340bps from 300bps for sovereigns, and to 350bps from\n310bps for corporates), we continue to expect spreads to trend gradually lower over the next six months,\nmore than offsetting the moderate rise in US Treasury yields we expect in the quarters ahead.\n� Positive scenario EMBI Global / CEMBI spread target (6-month): 290bps / 290bps\n• Yield stability in Europe's core markets and higher-than-expected growth in the US would provide a\nfavorable backdrop for EM fixed income spreads.

Now starts a difficult period with\nre-negotiation of the Greek austerity program. Also Spanish yields, which have reached hard to sustain\nhighs, need to be addressed. As the crisis carries on and hurts growth prospects for Europe well into 2013\nwe recommend to keep euro short positions. The risk for either an ECB rate cut or an extension of bond\npurchase program by ECB as well as the increasing risks to the banking system are weighing on the euro.\n• The extension of Operation Twist in response to weakening growth outlook in the US has its pros and\ncons for the USD. Global risk aversion and search for alternatives to the euro is supporting the greenback\ncurrently. The clear commitment of the Fed to respond with more stimulus to European contagion and\nthe approaching fiscal cliff is limiting the upside potential for the USD.\n• The CAD has increased in attractiveness recently due to weaker spot rates, while good growth dynamics\nin Canada still lead to rate hike expectations. We continue to recommend an overweight.\n• We keep the overweight position in the GBP. The BoE eased monetary conditions for the banking\nsystem to protect the UK financial market against contagion effects spilling over from the continent.\nApart from this, we think the pound remains well supported, because valuation is cheap and investors are\nseeking liquid alternatives to the euro.\n• EURCHF is currently trading at the low end of our expected range of 1.20–1.25, and we therefore keep\nan underweight position in the CHF. The 1.20 EURCHF floor prevents any CHF appreciation and the SNB\nhas clearly shown in May that it is willing and can protect the floor; we expect the SNB to continue in this.\n• Sweden and Norway stand out for their lower debt-to-GDP ratios and current account surpluses. The\nNOK appreciated recently, due to safe haven inflows. We stay neutral as the appreciation potential is now\nlimited. The SEK is very sentiment-driven and should profit in the medium term.\n• Longer-term debt issues and weak competitiveness of major exporters are hurting the Japanese\neconomy. Therefore the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance will maintain an expansive policy and\ncontinue to try weaken the JPY. However, current positive growth dynamics are supportive of the JPY.\n• For commodity currencies, the AUD and NZD weakened within ranges from March to May. We expect\nanother bout of weakness over the next three months together with increasing European troubles.\n• We expect the CNY to appreciate 3% against the USD, moving towards 6.15 over the coming 12 months.\nInternationally marketable instruments (such as CNH, the offshore version of the Chinese currency traded\nin Hong Kong) have similar appreciation potential.

The sideways move was visible across all commodity sectors, with gold (precious metals)\ndelivering a temporary price uptick after the May US nonfarm payroll release.\n• Despite signs of price stabilization, diversified commodity indices are likely to decline in the\ncoming weeks. Sluggish economic activity should put upward pressure on most commodity\ninventories. To mitigate inventory buildups, lower prices are required, in our view. Production cuts for\ncyclical commodities need to be incentivized, while demand needs a push.\n• The starting point for gold (precious metals) remains challenging, with supply likely to outpace\ndemand this year. However, the chance of further monetary easing (QE3) by the Fed - which is not our\nbase case - is an upside risk to the gold price. Given the weak fundamental situation combined with\nthe substantial QE3 risk we maintain our neutral position.\n• Easing geopolitical tensions related to Iran and further inventory builds in crude oil shifted the\nmarket's attention to sluggish demand growth. With muted incremental crude oil consumption, crude\noil prices are likely to remain under pressure. But as production cuts are likely to kick in, downward\nprice momentum should slow meaningfully. OPEC production cuts of up to 0.5 mbpd are needed in\nthe coming months, and should allow the Brent price to stabilize in the USD 80.5 - 90/bbl range (WTI\nwith a USD 12/bbl discount). But a sideways move in crude oil is not good enough to be long the\ncommodity. The Brent forward curve has joined WTI and moved into contango as well. Hence, we\nkeep our underweight position.\n• With regards to base metals, prices have room to soften in the very short run (4-6 weeks). Copper\nprices are likely to decline to USD 6,600/mt in order to weigh on scrap supply and compensate for\ndeteriorating Chinese import volumes. But the price decline in copper and other base metals should be\nshort lived. Fiscal and monetary easing in China provide the basis for an acceleration in base metal\ndemand and should keep prices largely flat on a 6-month horizon. Moreover, metals like aluminum\nand nickel are already trading deeply into the production cost curve, which we regard as\nunsustainable over the long run. We keep a neutral position on base metals until we see further\nconfirmation of a pickup in Chinese economic activity.\n• The outlook for ample supply in agricultural commodities, especially for corn, should still weigh on\nthe grain complex towards the end of the year. Some short-term price support from dry US Midwest\nweather conditions in recent weeks is not altering our negative stance. Soft commodities are also\nbattling with higher inventories, which will not bode well for prices in 3Q 2012.\nPreferences (6 months)\nCommodities\ntotal\nPrecious\nMetals\nEnergy\nBase Metals\nAgricultural\nunderweight\nnew\nSource: UBS CIO, as of 22 June 2012\nneutral\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\nold\noverweight\n34\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nPrecious metals Preference: neutral\nGold (25 Jun): USD 1,573/oz (last month: USD 1,573/oz)\nUBS View (gold)\n6-month target: USD 1,650/oz\n• The price outlook for gold is largely tied to quantitative easing by the Fed. Although the probability has\nincreased on weak US data, our base case still calls for no QE. Hence, current prices run on thin ice, in our\nview. In the absence of any monetary stimulus, the gold market is likely to be oversupplied by more than\n400 tons this year.\n• Physical demand out of Asia remains lackluster. With the USDINR trading at a record high, the world's\nsecond-largest gold market, India, is likely to witness a steep decline in jewelry consumption and a rather\nfirm increase in scrap supply. Central bank buying, estimated at 300 tons (7% of total demand) in 2012,\nwill not be enough to clear the market. Right incentives – i.e. temporary price setbacks – are needed to\nmotivate enough demand, before prices should manage to rebound towards USD 1,650/oz in 6 months.\n• The negative stance from a absolute return perspective, should not overshadow the relative\nattractiveness of the yellow metal. The higher probability of QE3 by the Fed poses an upside risk to the\ngold price. Hence, we maintain our neutral position.\n� Positive scenario 6-month target: USD 1,920/oz\n• Additional quantitative easing measures by the US Fed and the ECB are implemented, or inflation\naccelerates sharply in emerging markets. This would drive the gold price towards USD 1,920/oz again.\n� Negative scenario 6-month target: USD 1,250/oz\n• A liquidity crisis would curtail financial demand and weigh on the gold price. A similar impact would\ncome from deflationary pressure (positive real rates), or a combined Chinese and Indian hard landing.\nRecommendations\nTactical (up to 6 months)\n• In case of a conversion into gold, investors\nshould hold the position and target reconversion\nat the original strike level. Over\nthree months, we regard strike levels\naround USD 1,460–1,520/oz as attractive.\nWith option volatility on the rise, the risk\nreward for selling volatility has improved.\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• The risks for debt monetization in the\ndeveloped world and double-digit wage\ngrowth in China and India, the two largest\ngold markets, should ensure a steady rise\nin demand for gold and platinum over\ntime. Physically backed ETF positions allow\ninvestors to participate effectively in\nhigher prices. Positive real interest rates\npresent a threat to this view.\nGold in INR terms and Indian gold\ndemand\nWhat we're watching\nPhysical demand/supply\nFlows & rates\nWhy it matters\nFurther INR weakness in the coming months should determine jewelry demand\nfrom India. The health of coin and bar demand should be visible in the World\nGold Council mid-August release. After the drop in PGM production,\nkeeping an eye on South African PGM output is a must.\nTo judge gold-related financing deals, we track gold export/import between\nHong Kong and China. In addition we follow the latest uptick in ETF gold\nholdings and futures positions in gold to proxy investment demand strength.\nFrom an opportunity-cost perspective (real interest rate standpoint), we also\nlook at the upcoming meetings of the ECB on 5 July and Fed on 1 August.\n300\nStandardized to 100\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nJan-08 Jan-09 Jan-10 Jan-11 Jan-12\nIndia's gold quarterly demand - in tons (rhs)\nGold in USD terms (lhs)\nGold in INR terms (lhs)\nSource: WGC, Bloomberg, UBS CIO, as of 19 June 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n35\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nEnergy\nBrent (25 Jun): USD 91/bbl (last month: USD 109/bbl)\nUBS View (crude oil) Brent 6-month target: USD 100/bbl\n• A combination of renewed economic concerns about the Eurozone, easing geopolitical tensions between\nIran and the West, and further inventory builds in crude oil triggered a sharp decline in the Brent crude oil\nprice to USD 92/bbl and USD80/bbl for WTI.\n• We think the crude oil market is oversupplied, which is likely to push up OECD crude oil inventories to 62\ndays of consumption in the coming months. While it seems that Saudi Arabia has slightly reduced its\nproduction in May from 10.1 mbpd in April, the country could be in a wait-and-see position for longer.\nFirst, the EU/US sanctions on Iran take effect at the end of June/early July, and bring some additional supply\nuncertainty. Second, Saudi Arabia also sees the need for lower prices in the short run to support economic\nactivity in the developed world. But to prevent inventories from swelling too strongly, additional\nproduction cuts of up to 0.5 mbpd (0.55% of global demand) are needed in the coming months.\n• So what should investors do at current levels? Although downward momentum in crude oil prices is likely\nto fade, a sideways move should still lead to negative investment returns in the short run. The Brent\nforward curve flipped into contango from backwardation, which is deteriorating the risk reward payoff of\nthe energy sector. Hence, we currently maintain our underweight position.\n� Positive scenario\nBrent 6-month target: USD 140-180/bbl\n• Iranian oil exports gets subject to a complete embargo, or military interventions affect crude oil supply\nvia the Strait of Hormuz. Alternative OPEC supply routs would not be in a position to compensate for such\na supply shortfall. In order to curb demand, prices would need to spike towards USD 180/bbl.\n� Negative scenario Brent 6-month target: USD 75-80/bbl\n• Economic growth in the developed world contracts, thereby triggering a 0.5% to 1% decline in world\ncrude oil consumption. Although to a lesser degree, fading Iranian tensions and no supply cuts by OPEC\nwould allow crude oil inventories to build firmly and push Brent prices down towards USD 80/bbl.\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nIran tensions Resurfacing Iranian tensions could cause prices to spike higher, but an escalation is\nless likely, in our view. The focus is on remaining Iranian exports (currently around\n1.6mbpd versus 2.4 mbpd in 2011).\nSupply US crude oil supply has come in strongly – reaching 6.4 mbpd. Further supply\ngrowth would not bode well for WTI crude oil. We also look at oil supply related to\nSudan, Syria and Yemen, which caused a 0.5 mbpd decline in global crude oil\nproduction capacity. It seems that these production capabilities will remain offline\nfor a longer period – potentially until 2014.\nOil market reports Key dates: 12 July, IEA Medium Term Oil market report. Another round of\n(EIA/IEA/OPEC) downward revisions to demand, like in June, is not expected. The latest forecast\nchanges to demand have been meaningful.\n65\n60\n55\n50\nPreference: underweight\nRecommendations\nTactical (6 months)\n• We foresee further short-term weakness\nalthough less pronounced than the past\nmonth – we expect Brent to stabilize in\nthe range of USD 80.5 - 90/bbl in the next\n3 months. Production cuts and a pick up in\nemerging market demand should push\nBrent crude oil above current levels.\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• After the demand slump in 1H 2012, we\nexpect Brent crude oil to trade at USD\n110/bbl in 12 months. This higher price\nlevel for 2013 reflects our expectation that\neconomic activity should provide price\nsupport in 2013. Thus, three-year crude oil\nfutures contracts at USD 90/bbl remain for\nus mispriced and an attractive investment\nsolution for strategy-oriented crude oil\ninvestors.\nOECD crude oil industry inventories on\nthe rise\nDays of consumption\n45\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\nrange 2007-2011 2012 average 2007-2011\nSource: EIA, UBS CIO as of 19 June 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n36\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nBase metals\nPreference: neutral\nCurrent (last month): copper USD 7,317/mt(7792); nickel USD 16,528/mt(16833); aluminum USD 1,825/mt(1989)\nUBS View 6-month target: copper: UDS 7,400/mt nickel: USD 18,000/mt; aluminum: USD 2,200/mt\n• With the exception of aluminum, base metal prices stabilized broadly in June. But we see room for\nsomewhat lower prices in the short run (4-6 weeks). Deteriorating industrial activity in Asian countries,\nweak US data and the Euro-zone crisis remain a price burden for the sector in the early part of 3Q12.\n• To weigh on scrap supply and compensated for lower Chinese copper imports, copper prices are likely to\ndecline towards USD 6600/mt, in our view. For the rest of the base metals, prices could move deeper into\nthe cost curve of production. When it comes to aluminum and nickel, however, prices have already\ndeclined deeply into the production cost curve. In both cases supply cuts could come quicker and limit the\nprice downside from current levels.\n• In addition, supply uncertainty related to aluminum and nickel needs to be considered as well.\nIndonesia's new regulations on ore exports could jack up Chinese import costs by around 20% in the\ncoming quarters. We think such an increase would be meaningfully, as 60% of China's nickel pig iron (NPI)\nproduction and 80% of China's bauxite imports depend on Indonesia.\n• The reason why base metals overall should trade at current levels or higher in six months from now,\nrelates to China. We think the People's Bank of China has made the right monetary policy steps to achieve\nstronger credit activity and higher sequential GDP growth in 2H 2012. With this fairly balanced risk reward\non a six-month horizon, we maintain our neutral position.\n� Positive scenario\n• China eases monetary policy aggressively, by pushing credit growth beyond 20% y/y. Additional QE in\nthe US paired with stable European and Japanese demand would allow the sector to rally by around 25%.\n� Negative scenario\n• Chinese monetary conditions remain behind the curve, resulting in an economic hard landing. A severe\nescalation of the Eurozone crisis (deep recession/global impact) could also bring prices close to 2009 levels.\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nDemand The latest uptick in Chinese imports, driven by technical factors, do not\nreflect stronger end demand. The June figures (on 10 July) should give some\nclarity. That said, the attractiveness to import from an arbitrage perspective\nSHFE to LME has improved. Interest for physically backed copper ETFs needs to\nbe tracked as exchange inventories are structurally low.\nSupply\nCopper supply has room to improve in 2H 2012 from poor mine output in 1H\n2012. Fading supply disruptions and capacity additions put copper at risk.\nIndonesia's new export rules could have a positive one-off impact on aluminum\nand nickel.\nEconomic data/forward\ncurve\nPeople's Bank of China meeting, Chinese economic data (especially IP and loan\ngrowth by financial institutions) Key dates: 11–15 July\nRecommendations\nTactical (3-6 months)\n• From a timing perspective, building up\nexposure to base metals is not yet\nadvised. While we still expect higher\nprices over the next 6–12 months, the\nshort-term downside risks should offer\ninvestors better entry points, particularly\nfor copper. That said, existing aluminum\nand nickel positions should be kept.\nStrategic (>1 year )\n• Rising energy and labor costs provide the\nbackdrop for base metal prices to trend\nhigher. The strongest performance is\nlikely to come from zinc and lead, where\nexisting mine capacity is expected to peak\nin 2014. Environmentally challenged base\nmetals, like tin, should be in line with the\nsector average. For nickel and aluminum,\nample production capacity should lead to\nan underperformance in the long run.\nDue to its high current price versus\nproduction costs, copper should lag too.\nHeavy industrial activity in China, with\nhigh commodity use, slumped\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS CIO, as of 18 June 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n37\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nCumulative year-on-year values, in %\nFeb-99 Feb-02 Feb-05 Feb-08 Feb-11\nLight industry value added\nHeavy industry value added\nAgriculture\nPreference: underweight\nCurrent (25 June) (last month): Soybeans, USD 14.79/bu (USD13.82/bu); Corn, USD 6.09/bu(USD 5.79/bu);\nWheat, USD 6.91/bu (USD 6.80/bu)\nUBS View 6-month target: Soybeans, USD 13.5/bu; Corn, USD 5.10/bu; Wheat, USD 6.00/bu\n• Besides the overall commodity price backdrop, prevailing dry weather conditions in the US have been\nprice supportive for the grains and added to firmer prices.\n• While weather-related news flows might support grain prices in the short run (downward revisions in\ngrain yield estimates, especially corn), the 6–12 month price outlook remains negative. Global corn\ninventories should grow beyond 10% in 2012/13. We think this will more than compensate for firmer\nwheat fundaments (lower inventory estimates) in the coming months. For soybeans, current price levels\nsufficiently factor in the poor supply figures seen in recent months. This would be especially true, if South\nAmerican planting gets a boost due to soybeans' relative price improvement.\n• A strong supply backdrop for Brazilian coffee along with a weaker BRL has kept coffee prices under\npressure. For 2012/13, Brazilian coffee and sugar exports are likely to increase by 12% and 2% y/y\nrespectively, and keep the global market well supplied in 2012. Cotton prices saw some bouts of strength,\nbut demand has yet to work off high inventory levels at 74–75mn bales. With ample inventories and\neconomic conditions at risk, renewed price weakness is likely.\n� Positive scenario\nSoybeans 6-month USD 16/bu\n• Lower acreage and yield figures for the US can tighten the supply backdrop until 1Q 2013 (until the new\nSouth American crop comes). On the demand side, higher soybean use for bio diesel in Argentina and\nstrong Chinese imports (improvements in crush margins) are catalysts for prices to rally.\n� Negative scenario\nSoybeans 6-month USD 12/bu\n• Unexpected Chinese government stock sale of soybeans and deteriorating crushing margins for soybean\noil/meal production, would leave soybean prices vulnerable to a price correction.\nWhat we're watching\nUSDA WASDE report\n(monthly)\nGrains stock report\n(quarterly)\nUSDA crop progress\n(weekly, Monday)\nCOT (weekly, Friday)\nWhy it matters\nUS corn yields could be at risk in the upcoming WASDE release.

Earnings yields over 5 year swap rate are attractive currently attractive, yet the flattening of interest\ncurves has come to a halt and we see less support from it in the future.\n• Little supply of commercial space across the globe leads vacancy rates to gradually decline and low\ncapitalization rates in core markets support capital values. Also rental yields remain attractive compared to\nhigh grade bond yields. However, further significant capital appreciation is unlikely. This is especially due a\nslow down in rental income as economic growth is subdued. Hence, future performance is limited.\n• Although slightly reduced, we maintain our preference for US REITs due to stable fundamentals and like\nAustralia as a conservative play. We slightly overweight Hong Kong, stay neutral towards Singapore, but\nmaintain a slight underweight in Japan as fundamentals remain unconvincing.\n� Positive scenario UBS Global Index DTR (6-month target): 1,500\n• Improving macroeconomic data in the US, positive economic surprises in Europe followed by monetary\neasing in China help to increase growth prospects that support rental income growth, while refinancing\ncosts remain low in a low inflation environment. Real estate offers a comparatively attractive yield.\n� Negative scenario UBS Global Index DTR (6-month target): 1,300\n• The US growth path disappoints investor expectations and causes the comparatively high valuation levels\nthere to correct, significantly affecting global real estate. Furthermore, a more severe recession in Europe\ntriggers a tightening of credit standards, making listed real estate more dependent than ever on bank\nfinancing at a time when credit markets are already fragile. Real estate underperforms global equities\nbecause the correlation between the availability of credit and short-term performance is high.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nWhat we're watching\nCapitalization rates and\nrental yields\nTransaction volumes and\nfuture rental growth in\ndirect markets\nCredit markets and\nfinancing costs\nWhy it matters\nWe do not expect capitalization rates to decrease much from now. Rental yields\nhave already been pushed down by decreasing bond yields; we see a diminishing\nsupport from the interest curve, which has significantly flattened in the past.\nGlobal commercial real estate transaction volumes are down year-on-year due to\na lack of product in core markets and constraints on debt financing. Global rental\ngrowth has softened and very modest growth will feature major markets overall.\nLending conditions have been a little tightened. However, well financed listed\ncompanies have still good access to credit, while others are more restricted.\nRecommendations\nTactical (6 months)\n• We maintain our neutral stance towards\nlisted real estate after a good performance\nyear-to-date and due to a relative less\nattractive valuation compared to global\nequities. Going forward returns are limited\nby subdued revenue growth. However, we\nstill expect listed real estate to stay\ncomparatively attractive in a low growth,\nlow rates environment.\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• A cyclical slowdown in rents limits growth,\nbut attractive refinancing conditions are\nsupportive.

(HF were down 1.9% in May 2012 vs MSCI world at –8.5%)\n• Decelerating global growth prospects, the next leg in the ongoing Eurozone crisis, is challenging mostly\nequity long-short managers, who are net-long the market. While event-driven managers share some of\nthe performance drivers, idiosyncratic bets (event) reduce the exposure to markets. The real reason to own\nthis strategy, however, is the potential for out-sized return in distressed, high yield and other credit\ninvestments as the Eurozone crisis plays out. The inherent hedging in relative-value should remain\nappealing. Credit relative-value managers should perform well in this environment of higher fixed income\nvolatility and increasing pricing anomalies created by central bank interventions (OT2) and limited\ncompetition.\n� Positive scenario\nPrefer Equity long-short\n• A reduction of uncertainty (e.g. resolution in Europe) lowers equities' correlation and volatility. This\nhelps bottom-up fundamental analysis and equity long/short managers the most. Also, CEOs will likely\nmake more corporate transactions that can be monetized by event-driven managers, and a clearer\nmacroeconomic environment with more persistent trends would be supportive for macro managers\n� Negative scenario Prefer Trading (Global Macro + CTA)\n• A 2011-type scenario in which hedge fund managers get whipsawed through the year with risk-on and\nrisk-off circumstances, driven by a multitude of political interventions, is difficult to anticipate. That would\nimpact long-short managers, event-driven, and to a lesser extent global macro managers.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nGlobal equity direction\n/ economic cycle\nThe outlook for global equities becomes an important HF performance driver.\nThe economic cycle impacts the strategies differently.\nCorrelation\nCorrelation among pair-stocks; an important performance/alpha driver for\nequity long/short, the largest HF strategy by assets under management.\nLeverage\nGross and net leverage are key to monitoring risk.\nVolatility The direction influences certain HF strategies (e.g. convertible arbitrage).\nLiquidity Particularly for large HF that are less nimble to enter and exit their strategies\nRegulation\nVolcker's rule, USCITS III/IV\nRecommendations\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• Active risk management is instrumental for\ncapital preservation during adverse market\nconditions.

We like mid-market buyout strategies, which offer long-term exposure to attractive\ncorporate assets and which rely less on large bank debt syndications.\n• Our house view sees large parts of Europe in a stagnation, and business owners are reluctant to sell their\ncompanies, reducing PE deal flow in the region significantly. We therefore prefer North America, which\nwill see continuous (albeit suboptimal) growth, and emerging markets, which show positive fundamentals.\n• Prices for PE transactions have corrected by around 10% this year, although they are still 20% above the\nattractive levels seen during the successful years between 2000 and 2004. However, significant dry powder\nand high cash positions at corporations keep competition high and hinder prices from falling much further.\n� Positive scenario\nPrefer small-/mid-cap buyout and secondaries\n• An abating Eurozone debt crisis and improved business confidence would increase deal flow and exit\nopportunities for private equity managers, but would also increase entry prices. In such a positive scenario,\nwe would perceive commitment strategies to secondary funds as attractive for building exposure to an\ninvested private equity portfolio.\n� Negative scenario Prefer distressed debt\n• A renewed escalation of the debt crisis would significantly impact deal activity, the availability of debt\nand company owners' willingness to sell. At the same time, it would offer attractive opportunities within\ndistressed strategies and lower entry prices for long-term private equity investors.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\nWhat we're watching\nCredit markets\nCapital overhang\nPurchasing prices (Enterprise\nvalue / EDITDA)\nWhy it matters\nAvailability of leverage and credit spreads are important signs of the health of\nbuyout markets. Small/mid caps are currently financed at 4.3x EBITDA (vs 4.6x\nfor large-caps) and are more attractive given their lower reliance on bank\nfinancing in a period of ongoing bank deleveraging.\nWe track deal/exit activity to understand the pressure to invest, future price\ndynamics and draw-down profiles for investors.

Large-cap\nbuyouts have come down 10% from the peak last year to 8.6x.\nUSD bn\nRecommendations\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n• We prefer small-/mid-cap buyouts in North\nAmerica given the better economic\noutlook vs Europe, higher transaction\ncertainty and more attractive entry prices.\n• Investors looking for downside protection\nand stability during economic\nuncertainties can consider large-cap\nbuyouts in the US, which offer exposure\nto large, diversified companies at more\nattractive prices.\n• In Europe, the crisis and ongoing\ndeleveraging have led to attractive\nopportunities for special situations. We\nthus recommend investing in distressed\ndebt to benefit from the macroeconomic\nadjustment process and selling pressure\nfor many European banks.\n• We advise investors make an ongoing\nallocation to private equity in emerging\nmarkets, which offer an attractive way to\ncapture superior long-term growth and\nprovide access to small/mid-cap companies\nnot available through the stock market.\nPrivate equity deals continue to be defensively\nfinanced amidst economic uncertainty\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n5.2\n33%\n30% 31%\n31.8\n54.2\n31%\n64.7\n40.7\n39%\n46% 41%\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 YTD May 12\nPE backed high yield issuances (lhs)\n28.3\n90.6\n38%\n72.2\nEquity cushion in LBOs (rhs)\nSource: S&P, UBS CIO, as of May 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n40%\n38.7\n50%\n45%\n40%\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nEquity cushion (% of transaction\nvalue)\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Stefan Brägger, stefan.braegger@ubs.com\n41\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\nNote: We emphasize the equal importance of fund manager selection and the commitment strategy.
