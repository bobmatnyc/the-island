The Palm Beach PD had finished its investi-\ngation months earlier, he said, and had been waiting since then for\nthe case to move forward. He asked her once more to issue the war-\nrants. Once again Belohlavek declined, saying that the original offer\nher office had made to Epstein’s old lawyer had been resubmitted to\nthe new lawyer.
