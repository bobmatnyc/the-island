  "text": "US equities\n\nS&P 500 (27 June): 1,332 (last month: 1,319)\nUBS View S&P 500 (6-month target): 1,430\ne US firms on average show more resilient earnings than their global and especially European peers.\nModest domestic economic growth supports US companies' revenue and thereby earnings growth. About\ntwo thirds of revenues are generated in the US.\n¢ While profit margins are slightly higher than their average over the last 30 years, we expect them to hold\nup in coming quarters. Pressure from rising wages on margins is rather muted. So company earnings are\nforecast to develop in line with revenues.\ne In the next six months, we forecast the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of the S&P 500 to rise to about 14.0x\nrealized earnings from slightly above 13.0x currently.\n¢ The combination of expected moderate earnings growth and an expansion of the valuation multiples\nmake the US one of our preferred equity markets.\n\nA Positive scenario S&P 500 (6-month target): 1,580\ne An accelerating US and global economy reduces risks to company earnings. Investors begin to shift funds\ninto more cyclical sectors such as Industrials and Materials in light of better growth prospects. In this\nscenario, we would expect earnings to grow by around 10% in the next 12 months, and the trailing P/E\nmultiple to expand to around 15x.\n\nNegative scenario S&P 500 (6-month target): 1,115\n¢ The US slides into a recession and corporate earnings fall by around 15% over the coming 12 months.\nCoupled with an escalation in the Eurozone debt crisis, we would expect the P/E multiple to contract\ntowards 12.0x trailing earnings.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nBusiness sentiment The ISM is a leading indicator for US manufacturing and services. Key dates: 2\nJuly, ISM manufacturing; 5 July, ISM non-manufacturing\nThe Fed The direction of monetary policy and hints on further quantitative easing can\ninfluence equities.

We also like Energy.\n\ne We are cautious on Materials, where we\nexpect margin pressure to continue, as\nwell as Telecom and Utilities, due to high\nvaluations.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\n°¢ We like medium-sized US companies,\nwhich should benefit from robust\nearnings growth in the long term (see\nalso slide 21).\n\nOur sector stance in the US\nSectors us\n\nConsumer Discretionary\n\nv\n\nConsumer Staples\nEnergy\n\nFinancials\nHealthcare\nndustrials\n\nT\n\nMaterials\n\nTelecom\n\nee; e 1 ulvl vey viaya\n\nUtilities\nSource: UBS CIO, as of 28 June 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n14\n\nFor further information please contact CIO asset class specialist Markus Irngartinger, markus.irngartinger@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024149",
