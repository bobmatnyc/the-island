My sandwich\nwas “tongue on rye,” which I took as flattering, especially since some of my friends had turkey or\nham in their named sandwiches. Tongue was not only appropriate because I talk a lot but also\nbecause a tongue once helped me beat off a would-be mugger. I was coming from my parent’s\nhouse in Brooklyn and heading back to school in New Haven on the New York subway. My\nmother, as usual, gave me some food to take back to school. It was a solidly frozen, homungous\ntongue. I didn’t really want to take it, in part because it was so cumbersome to carry in the\nplastic bag in which my mother had placed it. As I got off the subway and approached the\nrailroad station, a guy grabbed my briefcase and started to kick me. I swung my tongue at his\nknee, knocked him to the ground, grabbed my briefcase and escaped into the railroad terminal.\nHad the tongue not been frozen solid, who knows what would have happened?\n\nSeveral years later, I was reminded of this event while watching an episode of , in which a\nwife kills her husband by hitting him over the head with a frozen leg of lamb. When a policeman\n\ncomes looking for the weapon, the murderer serves him the leg of lamb, well done, and he eats\nthe evidence. I too ate my weapon. It was delicious.\n\n384\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017471",
