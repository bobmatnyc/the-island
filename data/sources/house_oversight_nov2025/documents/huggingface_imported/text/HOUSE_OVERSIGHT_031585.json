  "text": "Cyprus problem is literally obstructing the deepening of the EU-NATO\nstrategic relations. The current crisis in Ukraine clearly highlighted, once\nagain, the need for closer cooperation between the two institutions.\n\nExternal Dynamics Necessitating a Settlement\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine also brings forward the necessity of alternative\nenergy supplies en route to Europe.

Common sense dictates that\nTurkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, together with neighboring countries,\nadopt a win-win approach and share the benefits of the natural resources\nof the region on an equitable basis. Such cooperation and the resulting\ninterdependency could only bring much needed stability and prosperity to\nthe region and help restore the ties between Turkey and Israel.\n\nThe Promise of a Solution\n\nCyprus lies at a strategic crossroads between the East and the West.\nHowever, as all these developments indicate, the island’s full potential can\nonly be utilized with the solution of the Cyprus problem. A solution will\nnot only provide for peace on the island, but will also prompt a wave of\ncooperation in its wider region.

The\nTurkish Cypriot side is ready to do its utmost in this regard, with a view to\nrealizing the island’s destiny to become a hub for peace and stability rather\nthan a source of conflict and tension.\n\nOzdil Nami is the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Turkish Republic of\nNorthern Cyprus.\n\nArticle 7.\n\nThe diplomat\n\nChina’s Instructive Syria Policy\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031585",
