  "text": "effective foreign policy or politics or economics can’t be improvised, the speed of the\nnetworks now outstrips the velocity of our decisions — even as citizens expect\nreactions at the ever-faster pace of their own connection. Think about the speed\nwith which answers are expected in almost any job; all those pressures are yet more\nextreme at the highest levels of government.\n\nFifth: Though the changes working through the global order depend generally on\ninnovation rooted in American institutions, corporations and ideas, there is now an\nuneasy sense: This order is slipping from American control. Look back just two\ndecades. Then America stood as the sole superpower, the global leader in finance\nand economics and technology - and embracing other nations into rules we’d\nwritten. Today, allies and enemies alike wonder: Is global order is collapsing? At\nwhat speed? And: What comes next?\n\nAnd, sixth, perhaps obviously to you by now: We don’t know where we're going -\nand our leaders don’t seem to have much ofa clue either. Though nations are\ncapable of adjusting activities at the tactical and operational levels - devising better\ndrones, sharper monetary policy - we've still set no clear strategy. American\nnegotiations are aimed now at small problems, not the heart of the issues we face. In\nwhat area of our national security today do we appear more confident than a decade\nago? What nation does conduct the confident, creative, energetic an global\nnegotiations of the sort that mark a power with a clear sense of direction?\n\nTaken as a whole, these six paradoxes represent nothing less than the potential\nunbuckling of the greatest power the world has ever seen. And because the whole\nworld is connected to that power, still more of the system may yet be rattled apart.\nWe are surrounded today not only by fish, but enmeshed in a world of connective\nlinks that are the tissue of our real power - and a source of danger. A sense of\ndirection. You have to feel as you look at this rotten, dangerous landscape we've\nmade for ourselves in recent years. We need a sense of direction.\n\n6.\n\nIn response to these challenges, America’s leading figures are now proposing a\nrange of ideas that don’t honestly resonate with much confidence. Really they are\nhaving a debate about if they should use more of the old style of power or less. What\nthey aren’t doing is grasping the nature of the age. So no clear, imaginative and\ncoherent picture of where we might head yet exists. In fact, as you're probably\nstarting to suspect, the very best ideas of our incumbent figures may yet make the\nworld more dangerous, may firmly and enthusiastically pull us into connective webs\nof danger and waste and mis-calculation they don't see. With our Seventh Sense\nwe'll be able to spot and think about many of these dangers in a new, better and\nmore rational way, free from the blinders of habit, but we should know what the\nworld looks like to the blind.\n\nTwo approaches are predominant among the most respected American elites, who -\nas leaders of the leaders of the establishment represent an important group for us as\n\n47\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018279",
