  "text": "profoundly in love with one another it was the ideal display of what the\n“honeymoon period” should have to show for. It was crazy, young and\nenergetic, just what it should be between two blossoming lovers.\n\nThe following morning we left the Princess Hotel, no longer under any\nof Jeffrey’s financial privileges or control so to speak, continuing our\nlove spree in another dwelling of our own accord. Three days later when\nwe finally showed our face for the first time since checking in downstairs\nin the new hotel lobby, besides to request fresh sheets and towels, the\nentire staff of the hotel had a good laugh at our expenditure, from their\nreaction it must’ve been nice to see a couple so affectionately fond of\neach other.\n\nNow we wanted to have another type of fun, Robbie had visited a\ntourist agent by himself before we got hitched to book a honeymoon\nitinerary for us to explore Thailand and beyond together, another surprise\nhe had in store for me. We left early in the morning and joined the\ncrowded bus for our journey beyond the border of Thailand to a village in\nthe war torn nation of Laos. When we got through the extremely armored\nvisa office eight hours off the beaten path, we then had to cross a flooding\nriver from a recent heavy downpour of rain in a slim banana boat that\nlooked like it could barely handle our weight let alone the excess of my\nluggage that Robbie was so kind to trek around the world for me.\n\nUnbelievably we did make it to the other side only to find that my\nhoneymoon in the tropics wasn’t exactly how it had been explained to\nme. Naked children ran through the dirty streets, with one boy that\ndecided to release his bladder on the pathway where we were walking as\nwe passed by him on the way to our hotel. My doubts of his choice in\ndestinations became apparent after that sight. Robbie was getting hungry\nafter we hadn’t eaten the entire duration of the trip and being such a\nrugged man he could digest just about anything. Deciding to stop on the\nside of the road he ordered some kind of seafood dish...daring I thought,\nsettling for some toast and jam, something safer I thought. Then I saw the\nlady behind the counter dip some plates in a dirty bucket full of dirty\nwater and then rinse in another bucket of water that didn’t look as bad as\nthe previous mud drenched one and then further proceeded to put my\ntoast and his food on top of them serving it to us all in a clear view. I just\ncouldn’t bring myself to even fathom it “I can’t eat that!” I mouthed ina\nhushed voice trying to quietly make my point clear but was made public\nwith his loud mouth outburst of ““Why not? Looks fine tome. You have\nto try and eat something, you haven’t eaten all day!” I know it was just\nhis caring side that was trying to force me and to top it off he is Sicilian\nand they’re all about eating so it was our first debate and now we were\nofficially married with many more marital conflicts to subsequently\nfollow.-Two head strong and stubborn people both with the right\n\n131\n\nI} Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004264\n\nintentions but still recovering from old wounds. It was only natural and\nimportant that we fought just as much as we made passionate love\ntogether. Countlessly proving to one another the true intentions of each\nother loves but sometimes in not so seemingly actions.\n\nFinally arriving at the hotel it was like a scene out of a horror flick. We\nwere showed up to the room that looked like someone had been brutally\nkilled in. The bed sheets were torn apart and the bed was stained with\nblood from some poor helpless victim. Nearly vomiting at the pure sight\nof the room and the stench that accompanied it, | was now tearing at the\nthought of even staying here for a single moment longer. “No way!” |\ntold my new husband and from the tone in my voice he knew I was\nserious. Not that | was not denying the fact | have never been an outback\ntype of girl. | was fine with that impression, I am no snob but give me the\nsimple luxuries of a clean bed and a shower then Ill make myself at\nhome, but this was just the epitome of filth and even possibly an act of a\nhorrendous event but who knows, the lady who showed us to the room\nseemed fine with it passing it off as a hooker on her period. In some ways\nthat was even worse...” Yuk...Okay Robbie it’s time to go...now!” we\nwere heading back down hill back to the passport center declaring our\npassage back into Thailand. Considering us a risk due to the short time\nwe spent crossing the border and back, the officials held us at gunpoint\nwhile others rummaged through our luggage for drugs or whatnot.\nFinding nothing of course they released us and stamped our passports,\nmaking us good for another three months if we wanted. We were thankful\nfor escaping with our lives alone, although we had nothing to hide but\nstill an endearing experience nonetheless in the first days of our\nhoneymoon of all days.\n\nChapter 23\n\nArriving in Koh Samui for finally a bit of relaxation in the tropics, it\nwas my idea of how a holiday should be, sunny warm, and clean... well,\nclean enough. We lived it up like kings for the next six weeks. Making it\nan ideal way for two strangers to properly get acquainted. Dancing into\nthe wee hours of the night and making love in the blistering heat of the\nsunny days we discovered everything on that island... mostly being each\nother. We made friends of all sorts, mostly travelers, but everyone the\nsame in being taken aback by our fairytale romance. With our captivated\neyes never straying too far from one another anyone could easily see the\nstrong chemistry between us.\n\nTrying to find the woman in me wasn’t difficult, as [ took to the bounds\nof marriage with such ease, no longer a girl I loved the idea of being a\n\n132\n\n6 Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIULFRLE004265\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021210",
