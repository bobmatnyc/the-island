In any case there will be\n\nneed for some work on my side before final filing is done.\n\nOn the other hand, if there is a \"checks and balances\" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers\n(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent.\n\nPlease do let me know.\n\nWe can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time)\n\nIn any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.\nEtienne\n\nDe : Darren Indyke\n\nEnvoyé : mercredi 15 février 2017 13:00:07\nA: Etienne Binant\n\nObjet : Re: TR: update\n\nThere is Simm in the bank account. We can prepare checks or wires for you to sign upon request. This way\nbook keeping gets done at same time. Just send back up with each request. How does that sound?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032976",
