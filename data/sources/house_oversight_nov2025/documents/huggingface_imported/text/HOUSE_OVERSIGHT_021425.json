I think you should include short concise cover\nletter. that you would like published in it entirety. it can refence your attacjment that you will put on your web\nsite? . that goes into more details but in general , these are false. they were either investigated and found\nlacking or ignored. etc. often they throw out the near publishing date merely to get you to ansser.\n\nOn Mon, Dec 11, 2017 at 7:53 AM, Lawrence Krauss wrote:\n\na few more minor changes.. one in first line of second paragraph and one misspelling corrected..so you can\nread this one:\n\nLawrence M.

While | am running the risk that you will report my comments, if you do, either\nout of context, or incompletely, | am responding with an effort to be complete. It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false\nand/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part. | treat people | interact with with respect, and | work hard\nto support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public. | do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of\nyour reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself,\nthen in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it\nalso opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to\nrespond to. The fact that | have remained a professor in all Universities with which | have been associated, in good standing, and also\nan officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they\ntrust my behavior. | was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as\nthey have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time\nwith the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my integrity or suggest | have a history of harassment, that too is\n\nfalse. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts’, as a scientist | try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather\nthan allegations and innuendo. | also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me\nor have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021425",
