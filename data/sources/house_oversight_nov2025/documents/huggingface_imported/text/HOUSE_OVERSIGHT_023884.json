I believe that our education like such as in\nSouth Africa, and the Iraq, everywhere like such as... and, I\nbelieve they should uh, our education over here, in the U.S.\nshould help the U.S. or should help South Africa, and should\nhelp the Iraq and Asian countries so we will be able to build up\nour future, for us.”\n\nMillions of Americans upon hearing this interview, which was re-\nplayed on every television outlet, thought this response was both very\nfunny and an indication of how stupid Miss South Carolina was. Most\nadults feel that they know what intelligence looks like and that they\nknow what stupidity looks like. Everyone agreed about the absurdity\nof this response. It was, after all, incoherent, and this was obvious to\nanybody.\n\nMiss South Carolina was given another chance to answer the\nquestion on the Today Show on NBC, some days later. Here is a\ndescription of what happened from the MSNBC website:\n\nShe explained Tuesday that she was so overwhelmed by the\nmoment she barely heard any of the question.\n\n“Everything did come at me at once,” she said. “And I made\na mistake—everybody makes a mistake—I’m human. Right when\nthe question was asked of me, I was in shock... I would love to\nre-answer that question.”\n\nCurty [of the Today show] obliged, reading the entire\nquestion as it had been asked during the pageant. This time,\nUpton [Miss South Carolina] was ready.\n\n“Personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the\nUnited States is on a map,” she said. “I don’t know anyone else\nwho doesn’t. If the statistics are correct, I believe there should\nbe more emphasis on geography in our education so people will\nlearn how to read maps better.”\n\nShe came back later in the show to deliver a flawless\nexplanation of lunar eclipses.\n\nHeld up on the Internet as the quintessential dumb blonde,\nUpton was an honor student in high school.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023884",
