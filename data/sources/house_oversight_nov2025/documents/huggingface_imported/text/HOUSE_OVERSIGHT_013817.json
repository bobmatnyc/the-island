  "text": "Now sitting in the plane, Julie looked out at the clouds as the wing cut past them, already thinking of\ntheir next plans: to find a place in the mountains and ski all year long, using income from a sail-rigging\nworkshop to fund the slopes and more travel.\n\nNow that she had done it once, she had the itch.\n\n» LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\n\nI was done with driving across town to collect my son from child- care only to slide across icy\nhighways trying to get back to work with him in tow to finish my work. My mini-retirement brought us\nboth to live at an alternative boarding school full of creative lifestyle redesigning children and staff in a\ngorgeous Florida forest with a spring-fed pond and plenty of sunshine. You can easily search for\nalternative schools or traditional schools that might accept your children during your stay. Alternative\nschools often see themselves as supportive communities and are exceptionally welcoming. You might\neven find an opportunity to work at a school where you could experience a new environment with your\nchild.\n\n—DEB\n\nTim,\nYour book and blog have inspired me to quit my job, write two e-books, sky dive, backpack through\n\nSouth America, sell all the clutter in my life, and host an annual convention of the world’s top dating\ninstructors (my primary business venture, third year running). The best part? I can’t even buy a drink yet.\n\nThank you so much, bro!\n—ANTHONY\n\n2)\n\nRules That Change the Rules\n\n=» EVERYTHING POPULAR IS WRONG\n\nI can’t give you a surefire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to\nplease everybody all the time.\n\n— HERBERT BAYARD SWOPE, American editor and journalist; first recipient of the Pulitzer Prize\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013817",
