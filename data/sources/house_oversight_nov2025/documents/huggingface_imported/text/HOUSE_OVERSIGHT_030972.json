Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and Trump's \nB-level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money launderers. \nWhat's more, Trump's own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain billionaire \nlifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle \nschemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the Mueller investigation \nappeared to be finding. \nIn November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later caught in a scandal \ninvolving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, \nFlorida for $30 million—a house that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and \nTrump had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, \nwith Epstein often counseling Trump on his chaotic financial affairs. Epstein took Trump \nto see the Palm Beach house to advise him on construction issues involved with moving a \nswimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the house, an incredulous Epstein \nsaw a severely cash-constrained Trump bid $41 million for the property, buying it \nthrough an entity called Trump Properties LLC, financed by Deutsche Bank. Trump, \nEpstein knew, had been renting his name, telling Epstein he ought to do the same—that \nis, for an ample fee, Trump was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the actual \nownership in a real estate transaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of \nTrump's basic business model of licensing his name for commercial properties owned by \nsomeone else.) A furious Epstein, suspecting that the real owner was a Russian oligarch, \nwho Trump knew, Dmitry Rybolovlev—part of the close Putin circle of government-\naligned industrialists in Russia—threatened to expose the deal, then getting extensive \nscrutiny in Florida papers. The fight became all the more bitter when, two months later, \nthe house was put on the market for $125 million. Well known to Trump, who often saw \nEpstein at his current Palm Beach house, Epstein was visited almost every day, and had \nbeen for many years, by girls who he paid for massages with happy endings—girls \nrecruited from local restaurants, strip clubs, and, also, Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Just as the \nthreats and enmity of the two friends increased over the house sale, Epstein found \nhimself under investigation by local Palm Beach police. Epstein's legal problems vastly \nescalated as the house, with only minor improvements, was bought for $96 million by \nDmitry Rybolovlev. That is, Trump had either miraculously earned $55 million, without \nputting up a dime, or Rybolovlev, or someone such as Rybolovlev, paid Trump Properties, \nLLC—actual owner unknown—$96 million, thereby providing a clean payment of $55 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030972 \nmillion to someone. Ryboloyley might have, in effect, paid himself for the house, thereby \ncleansing the money. Epstein, on his part, would spend 12 months in jail on a prostitution \ncharge. \nAfter the election, when Bannon was introduced to Epstein, Bannon told him, \"You were \nthe one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign.\" \n\"And rightly so,\" said Epstein. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
