And so, now,\nRinehart, who appeared to be being paid by\nMr. Epstein and certainly was adjacent to\nMr. Epstein's business office, was producing\nthese flight logs. So that, again, aroused\nsuspicion that the flight logs that were being\nproduced would have been sanitized or inaccurate.\n\nBut even -- I mean, I think the problem with,\nyou Know, you can't sanitize everything, that\nwould be too suspicious. And so what was -- what\nwas evident on these flight logs was, for\nexample, approximately ten flights by\nMr. Dershowitz with Tatiana has been discussed,\nwith Maxwell, with Jeffrey Epstein. One of them\nhad one female, which again in the context that I\nwas looking at, seemed to be a potential code\n\nword for underage, underage girl.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021908",
