  "text": "approximately correct. The other is a fair, data-driven assessment of public norms,\npolicy, and government, based on trusted data about current conditions. This second\nthread depends on availability of trusted data and so is just beginning to be developed.\nTrusted data and data-driven assessment of norms, policy, and government together\ncreate a credit-assignment function that improves societies’ overall fitness and\nintelligence.\n\nIt is precisely at the point of creating greater societal intelligence where fake\nnews, propaganda, and advertising all get in the way. Fortunately, trust networks give us\na path forward to building a society more resistant to echo-chamber problems, these fads,\nthese exercises in madness. We have begun to develop a new way of establishing social\nmeasurements, in aid of curing some of the ills we see in society today. We’re using\nopen data from all sources, encouraging a fair representation of the things people are\nchoosing, in a curated mathematical framework that can stamp out the echoes and the\nattempts to manipulate us.\n\nOn Polarization and Inequality\n\nExtreme polarization and segregation by income are almost everywhere in the world\ntoday and threaten to tear governments and civil society apart. Increasingly, the media\nare becoming adrenaline pushers driven by advertising clicks and failing to deliver\nbalanced facts and reasoned discourse—and the degradation of media is causing people\nto lose their bearings. They don’t know what to believe, and thus they can easily be\nmanipulated. There is a real need to ground our various cultures in trustworthy, data-\ndriven standards that we all agree on, and to be able to know what behaviors and policies\nwork and which don’t.\n\nIn converting to a digital society, we’ve lost touch with traditional notions of truth\nand justice. Justice used to be mostly informal and normative. We’ve now formalized it.\nAt the same time, we’ve put it out of reach for most people. Our legal systems are failing\nus in a way they didn’t before, precisely because they’re now more formal, more digital,\nless embedded in society.\n\nIdeas about justice are very different around the world. One of the core\ndifferentiators is this: Do you or your parents remember when the bad guys came with\nguns and took everything? If you do, your attitude about justice is different from that of\nthe average reader of this essay. Do you come from the upper classes? Or were you\nsomebody who saw the sewers from the inside? Your view of justice depends on your\nhistory.\n\nA common test I have for U.S. citizens is this: Do you know anybody who owns a\npickup truck? It’s the number-one-selling vehicle in the United States, and if you don’t\nknow people like that, you’re out of touch with more than 50 percent of Americans.\nPhysical segregation drives conceptual segregation. Most of America thinks of justice\nand access and fairness in terms very different from those of the typical, say,\nManhattanite.\n\nIf you look at patterns of mobility—where people go—in a typical city, you find\nthat the people in the top quintile (white-collar working families) and bottom quintile\n(people who are sometimes on unemployment or welfare) almost never talk to each other.\nThey don’t go to the same places; they don’t talk about the same things. They all live in\n\n139\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016359",
