The time\nhas come to find a way to solve this.”\n\nIn the half hour we spent together later, I could see that, physically, the Fatah\nleader from Karameh was not just older. He had a frailty about him. His skin\nseemed almost translucent in places. His hands shook slightly, with the early\nsigns of Parkinson’s. He spoke softly. But despite this ostensibly vulnerable\nexterior, I could see how daunting, and frustrating, he must be a negotiating\npartner. Henry Kissinger has described how Mao Tse-Tung, rather than engage\ndirectly in discussion or debate, tended to wrap his remarks in parables. Without\nstretching the parallel too far, Arafat was like that. While I tried to engage him\non how each of us might help cement the Oslo process, and ensure that the\ninterim agreement indeed led to a full peace, he responded with stories, or off-\ntopic remarks, which I was left to unwrap and decipher.\n\nHe began our discussion by saying that now that I was Foreign Minister, he\nwas glad to meet me. He said that he’d heard “reports” from his intelligence\npeople that when I was chief-of-staff, I had organized a kind of dissident band\nof generals who were working to torpedo the Oslo agreements. He compared\nthis to the OAS, the military cabal in France that had opposed De Gaulle. I\ncould only laugh. I told him I’d actually spent two months with OAS men years\nearlier, in Mont Louis, but that Israel was different. Even at times of the\ntoughest of disagreements, we were a family. An “Israeli OAS” would never\nwork, even if I had been crazy enough to contemplate such a thing. Which, I\nhastened to add, I was not.\n\nThere was another idiosyncrasy I encountered in Arafat. He was constantly\nwriting notes as we spoke. I didn’t mind that. But it did strike me as slightly\ndiluting the kind of frankness and openness I would find in most of the one-on-\none meetings I went on to have with foreign leaders as Peres’s Foreign Minister.\nMaybe he did it just as a kind of aide-memoire. But certainly in later meetings I\nhad with him, it did have the effect to making me choose my words more\ncarefully. That, I believed, reduced the prospect of exploring more creatively\nthe boundaries of each of our official positions. It also helped Arafat to argue, as\nhe did on more than one occasion, that Rabin, or Peres, or whatever Israeli\ninterlocutor he chose to name had promised him such and such. He always\nimplied this was based on his written record, though he never produced any\nevidence to that effect. He also never seemed to have recorded anything that he\nhad promised Israelis.\n\nI tried, with only partial success, to engage some of the other Arab foreign\n\n282\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028130",
