C. \nATTORNEY AT LAW \n20 PARK PLAZA, SUITE 1000 EMAIL ADDRESSES: \nBOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 02116 \nFAX \nNIiiiiiiiiiiiCY: \nApril 24, 2015 \nVia Email and U.S. Mail  \nJohn Zucker \nAssistant Legal Counsel \nOffice of Legal Counsel \n77 W 66TH St, Room 1628 \nNew York, NY 10023 \nRe: Good Morning America and Night Line interview with Jane Doe 3 \nDear Mr. Zucker: \nI represent Jeffrey Epstein. I have been informed by Producer James Hill that ABC \nintends to air an interview, conducted by a Good Morning America co-host, of a woman known \nin court papers as Jane Doe 3.1 I write to put you on notice that ABC's publication of Jane Doe \n3's accusations is grossly negligent or worse. The accusations, many of which relate to my \nclient, relate to alleged conduct that occurred approximately 15 years ago. The current \naccusations are simply reformatted and embellished echoes of previous allegations, which were \nfirst made by Jane Doe 3 to tabloid publications in the United Kingdom in 2011 and which have \nno independent news value. These allegations were then and remain now uncorroborated and \nhave been refuted or undermined by other, credible evidence. Indeed, a federal judge recently \nrefused to consider these allegations in pending litigation, finding them \"immaterial and \nimpertinent\", while striking the allegations and denying Jane Doe 3s Motion to Join, See Jane \nDoe 1 and 2 v. United States, 08-CV-80736-KAM (S.D. Fla.), Dkt 324 at 5. In addition, in that \nvery same litigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Timothy R. Slater filed a \ndeclaration stating that when Jane Doe 3 was interviewed by the FBI in 2007 she refused to \ncooperate with the investigation of Mr. Epstein declaring she wanted nothing to do with the \nmatter. For ABC to air these untested allegations on national television as \"news\" when Jane \nDoe 3 intentionally declined eight years ago to subject these same allegations to verification by \nthe FBI would be grossly irresponsible and severely damaging to Mr. Epstein and others. \n1 Mr. Hill informed me that she was waiving whatever rights to anonymity she might assert but I will, because of \ncertain legal obligations, refer to her as Jane Doe 3. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028965 \nThis is particularly true when ABC knows or should know that several, very specific \nallegations of Jane Doe 3 have been rebutted and/or demonstrated by others to be false. For \nexample, I understand that she has accused distinguished Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard \nLaw School of sexual misconduct involving her. Professor Dershowitz has flatly denied that \nallegation under oath in a federal court proceeding. I further understand that Professor \nDershowitz offered to play a tape recording for Mr. Hill that evidences that Jane Doe 3 has made \nrecent contradictory statements—that is, that she was pressured into including Professor \nDershowitz in her allegations and that she has a financial motive in making these allegations. \nThe Duke of York and the Royal Palace have likewise unequivocally denied Jane Doe's \nsimilar allegations against the Duke. Surely, these unequivocal statements of denial of respected \nmembers of society are entitled to some deference by ABC, particularly where, as here, there is \nsubstantial evidence of bias, improper motive, and serious credibility problems of their accuser. \nMoreover, additional claims of Jane Doe 3 can be refuted with objective evidence that is \nreadily obtainable by ABC. For example, she claims she was in the presence of both former \nPresident Clinton (after January 20, 2001, and before the summer of 2002) and former Vice \nPresident Gore (and his wife) at Mr. Epstein's Virgin Island home. I have been told by Mr. Hill \nthat she claims to be 100% sure of the facts regarding President Clinton. The claims are \ncompletely uncorroborated and compellingly contradicted by others. Neither former President \nClinton nor former Vice-President Gore and his wife have ever been present at Mr. Epstein's \nVirgin Island home. A review of United States Secret Service records, obtainable through a \nFreedom of Information Request would prove the falsity of the claim. Virgin Island government \nrecords would provide further confirmation. I also believe that Mr. Hill has been told by \nindividuals with percipient knowledge that former President Clinton has never been to Mr. \nEpstein's Virgin Island home. Upon inquiry, I am certain that you would receive similar denials \nfrom Mr. and Mrs. Gore either directly or by or through their counsel Mr. Boies. Jane Doe 3's \nfabrication of these claims against respected former officials undermines completely the \ntrustworthiness of each and every one of her remaining allegations. \nWe would expect that, in the wake of the damning independent review of Rolling Stone's \npublications of rape allegations involving students at the University of Virginia, ABC would \nproceed with similar, uncorroborated allegations with extreme caution. At the very least, ABC \nhas an obligation to verify—with independent evidence—the truthfulness of Jane Doe 3's \nclaims. Merely declining to air those portions of her interview that relate to President Clinton \nand Vice-President Gore is insufficient. If ABC has concerns about her credibility with respect \nto any allegation, it must decline to republish all of her allegations. \nIn June of 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges that do not relate to \nJane Doe 3. After an extensive investigation, the United States declined to prosecute Mr. Epstein \nand provided him with a Non-Prosecution Agreement. Mr. Epstein fully conformed to the \nresponsibilities and obligations imposed on him by that agreement. Mr. Epstein is not engaged \nin public activities. He is a private person who has complied and continues to comply with his \nlegal obligations, and he is attempting to move forward with his life in a productive way. The \nallegations of Jane Doe 3 are neither credible nor news worthy. ABC should not publish them. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028966 \nYours Truly, \n/s/Martin G. Weinberg \nCC James E Hill, ABC News \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028967",
