  "text": "Confucius Institutes, should be subjected to the usual procedures of faculty\noversight.\n\ne US governmental and nongovernmental sectors should disclose financial and other\nrelationships that may be subject to foreign influence.\n\nIntegrity\n\nForeign funding can undermine the independence of American institutions, and various\ntypes of coercive and covert activities by China (and other countries) directly contradict\ncore democratic values and freedoms, which must be protected by institutional vigilance\nand effective governance.\n\ne¢ Openness and freedom are fundamental elements of American democracy and\nintrinsic strengths of the United States and its way of life. These values must be\nprotected against corrosive actions by China and other countries.\n\ne Various institutions—but notably universities and think tanks—need to\nenhance sharing and pooling of information concerning Chinese activities,\nand they should promote more closely coordinated collective action to counter\nChina’s inappropriate activities and pressures. This report recommends that\nAmerican institutions within each of the above two sectors (and possibly others)\nformulate and agree to a “Code of Conduct” to guide their exchanges with Chinese\ncounterparts.\n\ne When they believe that efforts to exert influence have violated US laws or\nthe rights of American citizens and foreign residents in the United States, US\ninstitutions should refer such activities to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.\n\ne Rigorous efforts should be undertaken to inform the Chinese American community\nabout potentially inappropriate activities carried out by China. At the same time,\nutmost efforts must be taken to protect the rights of the Chinese American\ncommunity, as well as protecting the rights of Chinese citizens living or studying in\nthe United States.\n\ne Consideration should be given to establishing a federal government office that\nAmerican state and local governments and nongovernmental institutions could\napproach—on a strictly voluntary basis—for advice on how best to manage Chinese\nrequests for engagement and partnership. This office could also provide confidential\nbackground on the affiliations of Chinese individuals and organizations to party and\nState institutions.\n\nPolicy Principles for Constructive Vigilance\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020457",
