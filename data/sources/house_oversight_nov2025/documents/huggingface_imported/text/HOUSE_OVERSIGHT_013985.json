  "text": "Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice:\nDo not become a cause snob.\n\nHow can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How\ncan you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer\nresearch on coral destruction help those people who need help now?\n\nChildren, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your\ncause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make\nsense. The truth is this: Those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions,\nor that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are\nunknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world—however you define that —\nconsider your job well done.\n\nService isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment either. It can also improve life. If you are a\nmusician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor\nand change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life\nin the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.\n\nService is an attitude.\n\nFind the cause or vehicle that interests you most and make no apologies.\n\n=> Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\n\nAdults are always asking kids what they want to be when they grow up because they are\nlooking for ideas.\n\n— PAULA POUNDSTONE\n\nThe miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green earth, dwelling deeply\nin the present moment and feeling truly alive.\n\n— THICH NHAT HANH\n\nB ut I can’t just travel, learn languages, or fight for one cause for the rest of my life! Of course you\n\ncan’t. That’s not my suggestion at all. These are just good “life hubs”—starting points that lead to\nopportunities and experiences that otherwise wouldn’t be found.\n\nThere is no right answer to the question “What should I do with my life?” Forget “should” altogether.\nThe next step—and that’s all it is—is pursuing something, it matters little what, that seems fun or\nrewarding. Don’t be in a rush to jump into a full-time long-term commitment. Take time to find\nsomething that calls to you, not just the first acceptable form of surrogate work. That calling will, in turn,\nlead you to something else.\n\nHere is a good sequence for getting started that dozens of NR have used with success.\n\n1. Revisit ground zero: Do nothing.\n\nBefore we can escape the goblins of the mind, we need to face them. Principal among them is speed\naddiction. It is hard to recalibrate your internal clock without taking a break from constant\noverstimulation. Travel and the impulse to see a million things can exacerbate this.\n\nSlowing down doesn’t mean accomplishing less; it means cutting out counterproductive distractions\nand the perception of being rushed. Consider attending a short silence retreat of 3-7 days during which\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013985",
