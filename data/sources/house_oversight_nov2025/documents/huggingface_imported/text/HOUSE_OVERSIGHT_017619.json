  "text": "Page 16 of 31\n104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *81\n\nalready be providing reasonable protection for a victim before an offender is indicted, regardless of how the CVRA is\n123\n\ninterpreted.\nThe VRRA, however, does not contain a right to confer and a right to fair treatment and respect for the victim's dignity.\nTherefore, if victims are going to receive these statutory rights before trial, these rights must be found in the CVRA. With\nregard to the CVRA provision that victims have the \"reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the\ncase,\" !24 OLC contends that \"the phrase \"in the case’ implies the pendency of a judicial proceeding.\" '*° To bolster its\nconclusion, OLC then cites Black's Law Dictionary, which includes among its several definitions of the word \"case\" the\ndefinition \"a civil or criminal proceeding.\" !7® But OLC does not acknowledge that Black's Law Dictionary also defines and\nexemplifies a \"case\" more broadly as a \"criminal investigation <the [*82] Manson case>.\" !*7 Thus, Black's Law Dictionary\ndoes not help resolve the dispute as to which of the two meanings should be used, as there are clearly differing meanings.\nWhile OLC's reading may be a permissible one, so is a pro-victim reading.\n\nOLC also turns to the CVRA's legislative history to bolster its conclusion. But, here again, its analysis is misleading. OLC\nrelies on a passage from Senate floor colloquy between Senators Jon Kyl and Dianne Feinstein regarding the CVRA's scope. In\nOLC's recounting of the legislative history, the floor statements \"emphasize that the right to confer relates to the conduct of\ncriminal proceedings after the filing of charges.\" !°° For instance, OLC quotes Senator Kyl stating that \"under this provision,\nvictims are able to confer with the Government's attorney about proceedings after charging.” !?°\n\nThis is a truncated and deceptive description of the legislative history, so much so that Senator Kyl sent an angry letter to\nAttorney General Eric Holder complaining about the distortion. On June 6, 2011, the Senator wrote to \"express [his] surprise\nthat [OLC is] so clearly quoting [his] remarks out of context.\" !3° Senator Kyl then went on to observe that the colloquy began\nby noting that the right to confer \"is intended to be expansive.\" '3! The Senator further discussed various \"examples\" of when\nthe right to confer applied, including \"any critical stage or disposition of the case. The right, however, is not limited to these\nexamples.\" !3? It was against that backdrop that Senator Kyl gave the example of conferring about proceedings \"after\ncharging.\"\n\nIn his letter to Attorney General Holder, Senator Kyl also noted that he had:\n\nmade clear that crime victims had rights under the CVRA even before an indictment is filed. For example, ... I made clear that\n\ncrime victims had a right to consult about both \"the case! and \"case proceedings’ - 1.e., both about how the case was being\n\nhandled before being filed in court and then later how the case was being handled in court \"proceedings.' !73\n\n23 Exactly what \"reasonable protection\" means, however, remains uncertain. See generally Mary Margaret Giannini, Redeeming an Empty\nPromise: Procedural Justice, the Crime Victims' Rights Act, and the Victim's Right to Be Reasonably Protected from the Accused, 78 Tenn.\nL. Rev. 47 (2010) (suggesting the right has not been adequately defined and proposing ways to do so).\n\n4 18 USC. § 3771(a)(5).\n\n25 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 8.\n26 Id. (citing Black's Law Dictionary, supra note 59, at 243).\n27 Black's Law Dictionary, supra note 59, at 244.\n\n28 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 9.\n\n29 Id. (emphasis added) (quoting 150 Cong. Rec. 7302 (2004) (statement of Sen. Jon Kyl) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n30 Letter from Jon Kyl, supra note 3.\n\n3! Td. (quoting 150 Cong. Rec. $4260, $4268 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Dianne Feinstein)).\n\n32 Td.\n\n33 Td.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017619",
