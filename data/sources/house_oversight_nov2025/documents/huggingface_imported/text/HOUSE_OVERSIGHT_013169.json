  "text": "13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights 253\n\nof pure functional programming formalisms like combinatory logic. However, this purely func-\ntional style has not proved convenient, so the Atomspace in practice combines functional-style\nrepresentation with variable-based representation.\n\nTemporal links often come with specific temporal quantification, e.g.\nPredictivelImplicationLink <5 seconds>\n\nEvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $x\nEvaluationLink Dead $X\n\nindicating that the conclusion will generally follow the premise within 5 seconds. There is a\nsystem for managing fuzzy time intervals and their interrelationships, based on a fuzzy version\nof Allen Interval Algebra.\n\nSequentialANDLink is similar to PredictiveImplicationLink but its truth value is calculated\ndifferently. The truth value of\n\nSequentialANDLink <5 seconds>\nEvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $x\nEvaluationLink Dead $X\n\nindicates the likelihood of the sequence of events occurring in that order, with gap lying within\nthe specified time interval. The truth value of the PredictivelmplicationLink version indicates\nthe likelihood of the second event, conditional on the occurrence of the first event (within the\ngiven time interval restriction).\n\nThere are also links representing basic temporal relationships, such as BeforeLink and Af\nterLink. These are used to refer to specific events, e.g. if X refers to the event of Ben waking\nup on July 15 2012, and Y refers to the event of Ben getting out of bed on July 15 2012, then\none might have\n\nAfterLink X ¥\nAnd there are TimeNodes (representing time-stamps such as temporal moments or intervals)\nand AtTimeLinks, so we may e.g. say\n\nAtTimeLink\nxX\nTimeNode: 8:24AM Eastern Standard Time, July 15 2012 AD\n\n13.3.8 Associative Links\n\nThere are links representing associative, attentional relationships,\n\nHebbianLink\nAsymmetricHebbianLink\nInverseHebbianLink\nSymmetricInverseHebbianLink\n\nThese connote associations between their arguments, i.e. they connote that the entities repre-\nsented by the two argument occurred in the same situation or context, for instance\n\nHebbianLink happy smiling\nAsymmetricHebbianLink dead rotten\nInverseHebbianLink dead breathing\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013169",
