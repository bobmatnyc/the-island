  "text": "Page 75 of 78\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *966\n\nIn response to this Article and to other public criticisms of its rules, the Advisory Committee made several modest changes to\nits proposed rules. These changes are discussed in numerical order here. Other than these changes, no significant changes were\nmade to the proposed rules discussed here. The Advisory Committee has submitted them all to the Supreme Court and, unless\nthe Court takes the unusual step of disavowing them, they will go into effect on December 1, 2008.\n\nRule 1. In apparent response to my criticism that the definition of \"victim\" found in Rule 1 intentionally excluded a victim's\n\n\"representative,\" 78\n\non April 16, 2007, the Advisory Committee amended its proposed Rule 60 to allow a victim's\nrepresentative to assert a right. Rule 60(b)(2) now provides: \"A victim's rights described in these rules may be asserted by the\nvictim, the victim's lawful representative, the attorney for the government, or any other person as authorized [*967] by /&\nU.S.C. § 3771(d) and (e).\" >7? This change insures that victims' representatives will be able to assert victims’ rights. The\nAdvisory Committee also added language to the Committee Note stating that courts could make appropriate findings to resolve\n\nany dispute about who is a victim. *°°\n\nRule 5. At its October 1, 2007 meeting in Utah, the Advisory Committee approved a proposed change to Rule 5 regarding\ndetention hearings. The proposed addition to Rule 5 reads: \"In making the decision to detain or release the defendant, the judge\n\n\"\n\nmust consider the right of the victim to be reasonably protected from the defendant.\" >8! This language was lifted almost\n\nstraight from Senator Kyl's proposed legislation implementing the CVRA **? (which is discussed in the next section). This\nseems like a valuable addition to the Rules, helping to protect victims' rights in detention decisions.\n\nRule 12.1. At its April 16, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee apparently agreed with my conclusion that courts lack\n\nauthority to force a victim to meet with a defendant >*?\n\n584\n\nand struck language recommending such a meeting from its Committee\nnote.\n\nRule 12.3. Also at its October 1, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee responded to my point that the same language appears\nin both Rule 12.1 (alibi defense) and Rule 12.3 (public authority defense) regarding disclosure of addresses of crime victims.\n>85 It therefore proposed to add the same changes to Rule 12.3 that it added to Rule 12.1. *8° Unfortunately, for the reasons\ndiscussed at length here, now the language in both Rule 12.1 and 12.3 is insufficiently protective of victims' rights. *87\n\nRule 17. At its April 16, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee revised its rule on subpoenas for confidential information to\nread: \"Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require that notice be given to\nthe victim so that the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" *°8 This change responds to\nobjections from the American Bar Association, other groups, and me that the earlier rule encouraged ex parte [*968] issuance\n\n578 See supra notes 117-126 and accompanying text.\n\n579 Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60(b)(2), at 17 (emphasis added).\n\n80 Memorandum from Hon. Susan C. Bucklew, Chair, Advisory Comm. on Fed. Rules of Criminal Procedure, to Hon. David F.
