  "text": "all the transactions just completed . including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of range. in\nfact, alternative methods of payment .ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed (\n\nie including keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided , only because you\nspecifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that 1 was given\naccess to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections . ( as i said more needed\non phaidon ). Iwas then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light ,\nthough it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a\nunique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of\nyour largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch\nreality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were\nwearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated with the deal was known . It\nhad both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times , a detailed execution plan was\nprovided . then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow You told\n\nme that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid , (and even that\nwas more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did\nbrad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it\nwould be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. Ifthe transactions were\nnever consummated , i would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the\ndetailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the\ntransaction had even begun, had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re\nonly paying 20m has frankly , left me felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or\nRothschild transaction.\n\nDate: Wed, Jan 6, 2016 at 12:44 PM\n\nSubject: Fwd:\n\nTo: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com>\n\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY ,\n\nIn the spirit in which it is sent. our friendship is intact and solid , though ,it has taken a hit.\n\nMark was here this morning , the proposed transactions are extremely complex . and would take a great\ndeal of my detailed time. I do not know how, and even, if ,to move forward - . After months of hearing that\nyou would have no problem paying a large fee if you could only ascertain value. The last transaction. a\ntransaction which you saved over 600 million in tax. declared bullet proof by your attnys, and even if you\nwant to disoccount for its future realization, creating a savings of over 300 million real dollars. For some\nreason you chose to ignore our agreements , verbal written and emailed -and at the very last minute , after the\ndeal was complete decided that it was only worth 8 million dollars to you and your family. . ( assuming\nphaidon -richard happens. there isa 24m savings not including artspace and debt write down\nbenefits- certain to come later .. IMPORTANT NOTE\n\nthe phaidon transaction as currently contemplated will not work . WILL NOT !!\n\nWhen we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times\nthat i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I greatly preferred to have no financial interactions. I don't have\nmany friends and didn't want money in any way to interfere with our unique relationship. Reminder, For five\nyears you had the kind, but very goofy Eileen Alexandersson as the sole manager of your massive accounting ,\nlegal, investments. reporting, trusts etc. When I first told you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she\nwas incompetent you admonished me for \" speaking out of both sides of my mouth\". With regard Brad\nWechsler, there has never been a \" both sides. \". I have consistantly maintained since day one that he was\nhighly unsuited for the job. When you initially asked me to help convince him to take the role , promising him\na position to manage mirage investments I sent you a note saying that instead of hiring him you should pay up\nand get first class people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year now. . Brad , not me ,was tasked\nwith hiring new people , according to his biz school org chart.(nauseating ) and as you wanted him to take\nownership of the staff,he conducted many interviews alone. . you may recall that as late as may, you told him in\nmy presence that though six months had passed he had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified errors in\nsales tax, use tax, income tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions missed errors of millions\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023311",
