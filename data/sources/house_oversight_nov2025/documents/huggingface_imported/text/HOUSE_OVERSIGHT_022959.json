  "text": "Obama and Putin. Then Kathy Ruemmler, who has just left her job as White\nHouse Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney\ngeneral, but, in fact, will withdraw from consideration in part to work with\nEpstein.\n\nLarry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches Americna\npoetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry\nthat WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she\nmight go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget).\n\nMORE...TK\n\nPerhaps it’s just the ultimate feminist nightmare: Men (and a few\nopportunistic women) continue to come to Epstein’s because, no matter their\npublic bows to modern manners, they simply don’t care that he offends\nevery aspect of feminist sensibility; when it comes to power, feminism\ndoesn’t count.\n\nOr, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange\n“Jeffrey” stories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate\nbillionaire and publisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of\nEpstein), with a twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of\nEpstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems delighted to\ncultivate. In Epstein’s Paris apartment, 20,000 square feet on the Avenue\nFoch, a neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a\nstuffed baby elephant in his living room—that 1s, the elephant in the room.\nThe single book on his bedside table is Lotlita (he is, beyond the joke, a\ngreat Nobokov fan).\n\nOr, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the\nworld. There is a media version of the world, which most of us live in and\nlargely accept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those\npeople who live in the media itself and therefore know that it’s mostly bunk.\nIf the media says it, as likely some version of the opposite is true. I might\nguess too that for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there\nbut for the grace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time,\nrun afoul of prosecutors, the political moment, the media, or the Internet hoi\npolloi.\n\nEpstein is the Dreyfus of the rich.\n\nAnd then there is the glue of wealth. Once, at lunch in the Epstein\ndinning room with Bill Richardson, the former Governor of New Mexico,\nand past Presidential aspirant, when Epstein left the room for a few minutes,\nI asked the obvious question, the one everybody asks each other, “How did\nyou meet Jeffrey?” Richardson seemed surprised: “Jeffrey,” he said, as\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022959",
