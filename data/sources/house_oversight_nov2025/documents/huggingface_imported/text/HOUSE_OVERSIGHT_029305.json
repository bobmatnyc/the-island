The majority,\nwritten by Justice Anthony Kennedy,\nheld that DOMA is unconstitutional as\na deprivation of the liberty of the person\nprotected by the Fifth Amendment of the\nConstitution.\nThe decision opens the door for same-sex\nmarried couples to enjoy many federal taxrelated\nbenefits previously available only to\nopposite-sex married couples. These include\nincome tax benefits, estate and gift tax benefits,\ntaxpayer-friendly employee benefits,\nand more. Same-sex couples must now also\ndeal with circumstances under the tax law\nthat may create a so-called “marriage penalty.”\nEmployers must prepare for extensive\nchanges in the treatment of same-sex\ncouples. And individuals claiming tax credits\nand other provisions under the Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act are impacted\nby the decision.\nIMPACT. It is unclear how quickly the\nIRS and other federal agencies will react\nto the Supreme Court’s decision …or\nhow quickly same-sex couples may need\nto act to protect certain rights. President\nObama has directed all federal\nagencies, including Treasury and the\nIRS, to revise their regulations to reflect\nthe Supreme Court’s decision as soon as\npossible. Many tax professionals had\nbeen advising same-sex couples to file\nprotective refund claims in anticipation\nof a favorable ruling from the Supreme\nCourt. This is one of several strategies\nthat practitioners and taxpayers should\nfollow up on, as well as filing amended\nreturns before the applicable limitations\nperiods expire on back tax years. The\ndecision to strike down DOMA goes beyond\nrefunds. Same-sex couples need to\nconsider many other tax implications.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court did not extend\nsame-sex marriage nationwide; it declined\nto say whether same-sex couples had\na Constitutional right to marriage that\nwould override state law. But the Supreme\nCourt’s decision has opened up federal\nbenefits –including those under the Internal\nRevenue Code-- to same-sex couples\nconsidered married under state law. The\nWindsor decision leaves many additional\nissues unresolved or unclear. Among them\nare the status of “domestic partnerships”\nand “civil unions” under state law in connection\nwith federal benefits, the status of\na same-sex couple married in one state but\nnow residing in a state in which same-sex\nmarriage is not recognized, and the ability\nof married same-sex couples to divorce\nwithout first moving back to a state that\nrecognizes same-sex marriage.\nCAUTION. Immediately after the Windsor\ndecision was released, questions arose\nregarding the impact of residency upon the\nrecognition of marital status for federal tax\npurposes. Will same-sex couples duly married\nin one state who now reside in a state\nthat does not recognize same-sex marriage\nbe entitled to federal benefits, including\nbeing able to file jointly under the federal\ntax laws? …Or will they be required to file\nas single under federal law as well as state\nlaw? While President Obama on June\n27 expressed the view that same-sex marriages\nperformed in one state should apply\n2\n2013 Expert Analysis\nto another, he added that “I’m speaking as a\npresident and not as a lawyer.”\nISSUES AT STAKE\nIn December 2012, the Supreme Court announced\nthat it would take up two cases related\nto same-sex couples: Windsor, which\narose out of an estate tax dispute between a\nsurviving partner/spouse and the IRS; and\nHollingsworth v. Perry (CA-9, Feb. 7, 2012),\nwhich addressed whether the equal protection\nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nthe Constitution prohibits California from\ndefining marriage as the union of a man and\nwoman. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments\nin both cases in March 2013.\nIRS Denies Estate Tax Marital Deduction.\nIn Windsor, a long-time same-sex couple\nmarried in Canada in 2007. They had previously\nregistered as domestic partners in New\nYork City, where they made their home. One\nspouse died in 2009. Because of DOMA, the\nsurvivor did not qualify for the unlimited\nmarital deduction under the Internal Revenue\nCode and as a result, the executor of the estate\npaid $363,000 in federal estate tax that was\nnot otherwise due. The survivor as executor\nand sole beneficiary filed a refund claim under\nCode Sec. 2056(a) (under which property of\na surviving spouse generally passes free of federal\nestate tax). The IRS determined that the\nsurvivor was not a spouse under Section 3 of\nDOMA and, therefore, not a surviving spouse\nunder Code Sec. 2056(a). A federal district\ncourt found that Section 3 of DOMA violated\nthe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment because there was no rational\nbasis to support it. The Second Circuit Court\nof Appeals affirmed the lower’s court decision,\nfinding that homosexuals are a protected class\nand that Section 3 of DOMA was not substantially\nrelated to an important government\ninterest and violated Equal Protection.\nSUPREME COURT’S\nHOLDINGS\nWriting for the majority in Windsor, Justice\nKennedy found that DOMA had departed\nfrom the long standing tradition and history\nof reliance on state law to define marriage.\nThe State of New York had recognized\nthe validity of same-sex marriages, which\nresulted in a status that “is a far-reaching\nlegal acknowledgment of the intimate relationship\nbetween two people, a relationship\ndeemed by the State worthy of dignity in the\ncommunity equal with all other marriages,”\nKennedy wrote. He reasoned that DOMA\nsought to injure this class of persons whom\nNew York sought to protect, and by doing so\nviolated basic due process and equal protection\nprinciples applicable to the federal government\nand was therefore unconstitutional.\n“The decision opens the\ndoor for same-sex couples\nto enjoy many tax-related\nbenefits previously\navailable only to oppositesex\ncouples.”\nDOMA’s operation in practice, Kennedy\ncontinued, was to treat same-sex marriages as\nsecond-class marriages for purposes of federal\nlaw “by imposing a system-wide enactment\nwith no identified connection to any particular\narea of federal law.” DOMA’s principal\npurpose was to impose inequality, not for\nother reasons such as governmental efficiency,\nKennedy held. Therefore, the majority\nfound DOMA invalid for lack of a legitimate\ngovernment purpose that could overcome\nthe burden on those within the class whose\npersonhood and dignity New York had\nsought to protect through its marriage laws.\nCOMMENT: The majority opinion\nlisted numerous ways in which DOMA\ninfringed upon the dignity of same-sex\ncouples. Among these is financial harm\ncaused by DOMA to children of same-sex\ncouples by raising the cost of health care\nfor families by taxing health benefits provided\nby employers to their workers’ samesex\nspouses. Another example, Kennedy\nwrote, is that DOMA denies or reduces\nbenefits allowed to families upon the loss\nof a spouse and parent, benefits that are\nan integral part of family security.\nCOMMENT: Justice Kennedy qualified\nthe majority’s ruling at the end of the decision,\nstating that its applicability was\n“confined to those lawful marriages,”\nmeaning those recognized by the states\nthat currently allow same-sex marriages.\nKennedy observed that Section 2 of\nDOMA, which allows States to refuse to\nrecognize same-sex marriages performed\nunder the laws of other States, had not\nbeen challenged in Windsor and continues\nto be the law. On June 26, House\nDemocrats introduced legislation to repeal\nSection 2 of DOMA.\nCalifornia’s Proposition 8. On the same day\nthe Supreme Court announced its decision in\nWindsor, the Justices ruled, 5-4 (but with a different\nmix of Justices for and against), to send\nHollingsworth back to the California courts\nrather than to directly decide on the constitutionality\nof California’s ban on same-sex marriage.\nThere, the Supreme Court held that the\npetitioners did not have the standing to challenge\nthe lower court’s decision throwing out\nProposition 8, which denied same-sex couples\nthe right to marry in California. This decision\npaves the way for same-sex marriage to begin\nagain in California sometime in late July.\nFEDERAL TAX\nCONSEQUENCES\nUnder federal income tax rules, same-sex\nmarried couples can now presumably enjoy\nbenefits that had been unavailable to them\nbecause of DOMA. On the other hand, certain\nstrategic advantages previously enjoyed\nby same-sex married couples who filed as\nsingle individuals under the federal tax laws,\nhave now likewise ended.\nCOMMENT. Aside from the fact that it\nwas a federal tax refund claim in Windsor\nthat triggered the litigation that found\nitself before the U.S. Supreme Court, the\nopinion focused on Constitutional rights\nand privileges, without any technical\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nJune 27, 2013\n3\ndiscussion of the tax law itself. The Court\njudged DOMA for its impact on “over\n1,000 federal statutes and the whole\nrealm of federal regulations.” Very little\nwas said specifically about federal tax law\nbeyond that. Nevertheless, the federal tax\nlaw is clearly among those “federal statutes\nand regulations” impacted most directly\nby the Supreme Court’s holding.\nIMPACT. Same-sex couples who were married\nunder state law for years prior to 2013\nnow need to decide whether to amend those\nprior-year returns still open under the Code’s\nstatute of limitations, to reflect a change\nfrom unmarried to married filing status.\nSame-sex married couples also should consider\nupdating their estate plans, based upon\nthe estate and gift tax impact of Windsor.\nINCOME TAX BENEFITS\nAND DISADVANTAGES\nBecause of the Supreme Court’s decision, the\nsame tax benefits and disadvantages faced by\njust-married, opposite-sex couples—in changing\nfrom filing as separate, unmarried individuals\nto filing as married filing jointly (or\nmarried filing separately)—are now shared by\nsame-sex married couples. Likewise, however,\nthose same-sex couples not married under\nstate law continue to be subject to the same\ndisadvantages and benefits, and face many of\nthe same strategic decisions, as unmarried heterosexual\ncouples under the federal tax law.\nCAUTION. As mentioned, above, resolution\nis pending on the issue of whether\nrecognition or non-recognition of a samesex\nmarriage in the State in which the\nsame-sex couple currently reside controls\nwhether the IRS will treat the couple as\nmarried for federal tax purposes. Most\nfederal agencies have defined marriage in\nthe past based on a couple’s residency and\nnot where they were married.\nFILING STATUS\nA taxpayer’s filing status depends in large\npart—if not exclusively in most cases—on\nthe taxpayer’s marital status. Taxpayers may\nbe single, surviving spouse, head of household,\nmarried filing joint returns, or married\nfiling separately. Filing status, in turn, determines\nthe right to many tax benefits, both in\nterms of access and amount. Income tax rate\nbracket levels, the standard deduction, personal\nexemptions, and the adjusted gross income\n(AGI) amounts at which many tax benefits\n“phaseout” all hinge upon filing status.\nJoint Return Status. Because of the Supreme\nCourt’s Windsor decision, same-sex couples who\ncurrently are married under state law are presumably\nnow also barred for federal tax purposes from\nfiling separate returns as unmarried (or as head of\nhousehold, in most cases); they must file either\njointly or married filing separately for 2013 (unless\nthey are divorced or have a final separation\nagreement in place by the end of 2013). The\ngeneral rule that has always applied to filing status\nnow presumably applies to same-sex married\nstatus as well: an individual’s filing status is determined\nfor the entire year based upon marital\nstatus on December 31 st of that year. The IRS is\nexpected to issue guidance in this area.\nIMPACT. Leading up to the Supreme\nCourt’s decision, many same-sex couples\nfiled protective income tax refund claims\nusing married filing jointly status. A protective\nrefund claim is a claim filed to\nprotect the taxpayer’s right to a potential\nrefund based on a contingent event for\na taxable period for which the period of\nlimitations is about to expire. Now that\nthe Supreme Court’s decision is out, full\nrefund claims, rather than protective\nclaims, should be filed going forward.\nCOMMENT. Under current rules, a taxpayer\ncan sign a joint return if his or her\nspouse is serving in a combat zone. In other\nlimited cases where one spouse cannot sign\nthe joint return, such as because of injury or\nillness, the other spouse may sign the return\nand attach a statement explaining why the\nspouse was unable to sign. Same-sex couples\nwho are married under state law are now\npresumably allowed these signing benefits.\nCOMMENT. Because same-sex marriage\nis relatively new, the tax implications\nof divorce of a same-sex couple are only\nstarting to manifest themselves.\nThe Marriage Penalty. Same-sex married\ncouples who have been denied joint return\nstatus under the federal tax laws prior\nto the Supreme Court’s Windsor decision\nnow need to investigate the effect of joint\nreturn status, both for returns that will be\nfiled in the future and for prior year returns\nstill open within the statute of limitations\nrefund-claim period (generally, but not always,\nthree years from filing – see this Briefing,\nbelow, for a discussion of this deadline).\nThe benefits of filing a joint return may\nnot always be greater than filing separately\nas unmarried individuals. Both differences\nin tax rate bracket amounts and a variety of\nincome floors and thresholds used to determine\nthe right to certain tax breaks come\ninto play in determining whether some\nsame-sex couples were better off, income\ntax-wise, before the Supreme Court’s decision;\nand what they should do now.\nIMPACT. Individuals in a relationship\nwho are not married and who each realize\napproximately the same level of\nNO NATIONWIDE\nEXTENSION OF SAME-\nSEX MARRIAGE\nThe Supreme Court struck down Section\n3 of DOMA, which defined marriage as\na legal union between one man and one\nwoman as husband and wife and defined\nspouse as only a person of the opposite\nsex who is a husband or wife. The\nSupreme Court did not strike down Section\n2 of DOMA, which provides that\nno state, territory or possession of the\nUnited States shall be required to give\neffect to any marriage between persons\nof the same sex under the laws of any\nother such jurisdiction or to any right\nor claim arising from such relationship.\nSection 2 was not challenged and, therefore,\nwas not at issue in Windsor.\nCCH Tax Briefing\n4\n2013 Expert Analysis\nincome and have similar tax deductions\n(at least in amount) have generally been\nbetter off from a tax standpoint filing as\nunmarried individuals. However, that\nassessment tilts in favor of marriage and\nfiling a joint return if one partner earns\nor deducts the greater portion of any otherwise\ncombined amounts.\nCOMMENT. Although much press was\ngiven to “marriage penalty relief” when\nthe Bush-era tax cuts were permanently\nextended by the American Taxpayer Relief\nAct of 2012 (ATRA), such relief in fact\nonly related to equality within the standard\ndeduction amount and the top portion\nof the 15 percent income tax bracket.\nOther “marriage penalties” continue to\nexist within the tax law depending upon\ncircumstances. For example, the 33 percent\ntax bracket for joint filers in 2013\nstarts at $223,050 taxable income, while\nthe 33 percent bracket for single taxpayers\nstarts at $183,250. If there were no marriage\npenalty imposed on higher-income\nindividuals earning similar amounts, the\n33 percent bracket for joint filers would\nnot start until reaching the $366,500\nlevel, or double that set under the Internal\nRevenue Code for single filers.\nMarried Filing Separately. If same-sex\nmarried couples post-Windsor want to keep\ntheir finances (and liabilities) separate for the\npurpose of filing separate returns, they will\ngenerally—but not always—pay more federal\nincome tax. The rate brackets for “married\nfiling separately” are higher than “unmarried,\nnot surviving spouse or head of household.”\nInnocent Spouse Status. Married taxpayers\nwho file joint returns are jointly and severally\nresponsible for the tax and any interest or penalty\ndue on the joint return. In some cases, a\nspouse will be relieved of this shared liability for\ntax owed on a joint tax return. Three types of\nrelief are available: general innocent spouse relief;\nseparate liability relief; and equitable relief.\nIMPACT. Because of the Supreme\nCourt’s decision, the three types of innocent\nspouse relief are now presumably\navailable to same-sex married couples.\nSame-sex married partners cannot turn\na blind eye to any item that is listed on\na joint return. A decision to file joint\nreturns retroactively for prior tax years\nas the result of the Supreme Court’s decision,\ntherefore, should include consideration\nof the joint and several liability\nthat would be triggered. Separate return\nstatus would eliminate the issue of joint\nliability entirely. The IRS is expected to\nissue guidance in this area.\nSurviving Spouse Claims. A surviving\nspouse computes tax using the same rate\nbrackets as married couples filing joint returns.\nRules for surviving spouse status for\nsame-sex married couples now presumably\nfollow the same rules as for opposite-sex\ncouples. If a taxpayer is a surviving spouse,\nthe year the spouse died is the last year for\nwhich the taxpayer can file a joint return\nwith that spouse. A taxpayer can also qualify\nas surviving spouse for two tax years following\nthe year in which his or her spouse\ndies if the taxpayer maintains a household\nfor certain dependents (a child, adopted\nchild, foster child, or stepchild), has not\nremarried, and filed or could have filed a\njoint return with the spouse for the year in\nwhich his or her spouse died.\nFILING STATUS, AGI FLOORS\nAND THRESHOLD AMOUNTS\nThe amounts of income and deductions\nreported on a return are used by the IRS\nin determining whether certain threshold\nlevels and floors are reached. Those\namounts in turn determine access to a variety\nof tax benefits. Some of these floors\nor threshold amounts are applied to all\nfiling statuses uniformly; others vary depending\nupon filing status.\nIMPACT. Depending upon adjusted gross\nincome (AGI) and other levels reported\non a return, combining the income and\ndeductions of each same-sex partner under\na single joint return may or may not\nwork to the advantage of the couple as a\nunit, in contrast to filing as unmarried or\nmarried filing separately.\nFloors. Tax benefits dependent upon floor\nlevels of adjusted gross income (AGI) or\nmodified AGI (MAGI) set forth under the\nInternal Revenue Code include the following\nitemized deduction categories, among others:\nMedical expense deduction floor (10\npercent AGI (temporarily at 7.5 percent\nfor taxpayers over age 65));\nCasualty loss deduction floor (10 percent\nAGI); and\nMiscellaneous items deduction floor (2\npercent AGI).\nCOMMENT. In the case of married individuals\nwho file separate returns, if one\nspouse itemizes deductions on his or her\nreturn, the other spouse must also do so irrespective\nof whether his or her standard\ndeduction would be larger. This rule does\nnot apply to unmarried couples who file\nseparate returns.\nCeilings. Use of excess capital losses to offset\nordinary income is generally limited to\n$3,000 per return, whether on a joint return\nor an unmarried single return. Taxpayers\nwho are married filing separately, however,\nare allowed only a $1,500 maximum capital\nloss deduction; the balance in all cases may\nbe carried forward into the next tax year.\nThresholds. For some taxpayers, AGI above\ndesignated thresholds reduces certain tax\nbenefits. A reduction in itemized deductions\nand a reduction in personal exemptions\nare the most common among higherincome\nindividuals. For example:\nItemized deductions otherwise allowed must\nbe reduced by the lesser of (1) three percent of\nAGI that exceeded a threshold amount (see\nchart, below) adjusted annually for inflation,\nor (2) 80 percent of the total amount of otherwise\nallowable itemized deductions. No reduction\nis required in the case of deductions\nfor medical expenses, investment interest,\nand casualty, theft or wagering losses.\nPersonal exemptions, likewise, are required\nto be reduced where AGI exceeds a specified\nthreshold amount: by two percent for each\n$2,500 (or fraction thereof) by which AGI\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nJune 27, 2013\n5\nexceeds the applicable threshold amount\n(see chart, below) for the year ($1,250 for\nmarried persons filing separately).\nNet Capital Gains/ Net Investment Income.\nAGI thresholds are also used in taxing\ninvestment-type income:\nNet Capital Gains are taxed at the 20\npercent maximum rate at levels beyond\nwhich income would otherwise be\npushed into the 39.6 percent bracket\n(for 2013, that applicable threshold\namount is $450,000 AGI for married\nindividuals filing joint returns and surviving\nspouses, $425,000 for heads of\nhouseholds, $400,000 for single individuals,\nand $225,000 for married individuals\nfiling separate returns. (The\n“regular” 15 percent capital gains rate\nis likewise reduced to zero percent for\ntaxpayers in the 10 percent bracket—\na benefit that can be used by same-sex\ncouples where one partner has very\nlittle income).\nNet Investment Income, as defined under\nnew Code Section 1411, is taxed\nstarting in 2013 at 3.8 percent, keyed\nto a modified AGI threshold based on\nfiling status ($250,000 for joint filers;\n$125,000 for married, filing separately;\nand $200,000 for all others).\nDeduction/Credit Thresholds. Thresholds\nare also commonly used to restrict deductions,\ncredits and other benefits based upon adjusted\ngross income and filing status:\n2013 AGI (MAGI) PHASEOUT THRESHOLD START POINTS\nJoint Return Single Married Filing Separately\nItemized Deductions: $300,000 $250,000 $150,000\nPersonal Exemptions: $300,000 $250,000 $150,000\nMaximum Net Capital Gains: $450,000 $400,000 $225,000\nNet Investment Income Surtax: $250,000 $200,000 $125,000\nAdditional Medicare Tax: $250,000 $200,000 $125,000\nChild Tax Credit: $110,000 $75,000 $55,000\nAmerican Opportunity Credit: $160,000 $80,000 $0\nLifetime Learning Credit: $107,000 $53,000 $0\nIRA Deduction (plan participants): $95,000 $59,000 *\nRoth IRA Eligibility: $178,000 $112,000 **\n*Deduction determined under single status if not living with spouse at anytime during tax year; otherwise partial deduction if MAGI is less than\n$10,000 and no deduction if MAGI is $10,000 or more\n**$10,000 if lived with spouse at anytime during tax year; $112,000 if did not live with spouse at anytime during tax year\nIMPACT. In dealing with threshold\namounts, a benefits/drawbacks analysis generally\ndepends upon the extent to which that\nportion of any tax benefit below a threshold\namount would otherwise go unused by\none of the partners if filing separately. With\ncertain deductions, credits or contribution\nlevels, however, electing “married filing separately”\nstatus may relegate each spouse to\n$0 benefit depending upon circumstances.\nOTHER SAME-SEX COUPLE\nINCOME TAX ISSUES\nBeing married for federal tax purposes—exclusive\nof the right to any particular filing\nstatus—can also give rise to additional tax\nbenefits and restrictions. The following situations\nmay be particularly relevant in the\ncase of married same-sex couples after the\nSupreme Court’s Windsor decision:\nDependency Exemptions. In 2012, the\nIRS explained on its website that if a child\nis a qualifying child under Code Sec. 152(c)\nand both parents are same-sex partners,\neither parent, but not both, may claim a\ndependency deduction for the qualifying\nchild if separate returns are filed. If both\nparents can otherwise claim a dependency\ndeduction for the child on their income tax\nreturns, the IRS will treat the child as the\nqualifying child of the parent with whom\n“Same-sex couples may\nfind that the benefits of\nfiling a joint return may\nnot always be greater than\nfiling separately...”\nthe child resides for the longer period of\ntime. If the child resides with each parent\nfor the same amount of time during the tax\nyear, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying\nchild of the parent with the higher adjusted\ngross income.\nCCH Tax Briefing\n6\n2013 Expert Analysis\nCOMMENT. The Supreme Court decision\nwill presumably trigger tie-breaker\nrules and divorce settlement agreements\npreviously available only to opposite-sex\nmarried couples.\nEducation Benefits. Access to a number of\neducation tax credits by same-sex couples\nhas been limited, both because of a student’s\nstatus as a member or non-member of the\ntaxpayer’s family and because lower phaseout\nlevels that apply to unmarried filers.\nAOTC and Lifetime Learning Credit:\nA taxpayer can claim the American Opportunity\nTax Credit (AOTC) or the\nLifetime Learning Credit for qualified\nexpenses paid by the taxpayer for the\neducation of the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s\nspouse, or the taxpayer’s claimed dependent\nfor the tax year for which the credit\nis claimed. Because of DOMA, a taxpayer\ncould not claim the AOTC or Lifetime\nLearning Credit for qualified expenses\npaid by his or her same-sex spouse.\nCoverdell Education Savings Accounts.\nA Coverdell Education Savings\nAccount (ESA) is a savings vehicle\nsimilar to an individual retirement\naccount (IRA). If a Coverdell ESA\nis transferred to a surviving spouse as\nthe result of the beneficiary’s death,\nthe Coverdell ESA retains its status\nand the spouse may treat the account\nas his or her own and need not withdraw\nthe assets as a result of the transfer.\nBecause of DOMA, this treatment\nhad been unavailable to the surviving\nspouse of a same-sex married couple.\nIRA Withdrawals For Education.\nTaxpayers who own IRAs (traditional,\nRoth, SEP IRAs and SIMPLE\nIRAs) can make penalty-free withdrawals\nto pay higher education expenses\nto the extent the distribution\ndoes not exceed the qualified higher\neducation expenses of the taxpayer,\nthe taxpayer’s spouse, or the child or\ngrandchild of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s\nspouse. Once again, because\nof DOMA, this treatment had been\nunavailable to the surviving spouse of\na same-sex married couple.\nPost-Death IRA Payments. When a surviving\nspouse is the beneficiary of an individual\nretirement account (IRA) he or she has certain\noptions not granted to other beneficiaries,\nincluding the ability to rollover the decedent’s\nIRA, tax free, to another retirement\nplan. And, if the surviving spouse is the sole\nbeneficiary, he or she can elect to treat the\nIRA as if it were his or her own. These options\nmay allow the survivor to delay the\nstart of required minimum distributions\n(RMDs) from the account and to stretch\nout the payment of RMDs over a longer period\nof time. DOMA had foreclosed these\nmore favorable spousal benefits for same-sex\nmarried spouses. The Supreme Court’s decision\nin Windsor presumably opens up these\ndistribution benefits to same-sex spouses.\n“In the case of family\nattribution rules, it is\nunclear whether application\nof marital status for samesex\nspouses relates back\nto transactions already\ncompleted.”\nFamily Stock Attribution Rules. Code Sec.\n267 contains attribution rules designed to\nprevent related taxpayers (including “spouses”\nunder Sec. 267(c)(4)) from recognizing\nlosses and other tax benefits otherwise allowed\nin a variety of transactions. For example,\nan individual is treated under Code\nSec. 318(a)(1) as constructively owning stock\nowned directly or indirectly by his or her\nspouse (unless legally separated), children,\ngrandchildren, or parents. Stock attribution\nrules under Code Sec. 318 apply when determining\nwhether a redemption of stock is\ntreated as a sale or exchange or as a dividend.\nLikewise, prohibited transactions involving\npension plans under Code Sec. 4975 are\ndefined, in part, upon dealing with certain\npersons, including spouses of those persons.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court’s grant of\nfederal marital status to same-sex married\npersons is apparently not only prospective\nstarting June 26, 2013, the date of the\nWindsor decision, but also presumably\napplies retroactively to all open years.\nNevertheless, in the case of attribution\nrules, application of marital status for\nsame-sex spouses may not necessarily relate\nback to transactions already completed.\nThe need under the tax laws to\nhave finality for transactions as they occur\nappears to be the overriding argument\nin favor of not giving retroactive effect to\nfamily attribution. Eventual IRS guidance\non this issue is anticipated.\nResident And Non-Resident Aliens. Presumably,\nthe Supreme Court’s decision applies\nto same-sex resident or nonresident\naliens to the extent they are considered married\nunder the law of a foreign jurisdiction.\nFurther clarification of the application of\nthe Supreme Court’s Windsor decision to\nthese taxpayers may be needed.\nESTATE AND GIFT TAXATION\nThe Windsor case, as discussed above in this\nBriefing, involved the estate tax marital deduction.\nThe marital deduction is a key planning\ntool to defer transfer taxes until the\nsurviving spouse dies. Because of DOMA,\nsame-sex married couples could not take\nadvantage of the estate tax marital deduction\nand other provisions, such as portability.\nDOMA also precluded same-sex married\ncouples from the benefits of special rules for\ngifts between spouses and from spouses.\nMarital Deduction. Code Sec. 2056 provides\nan unlimited deduction from the gross estate\nfor property passing from a decedent to a surviving\nspouse. Generally, the decedent must\nbe survived by his or her spouse who is a U.S.\ncitizen at the time of the decedent’s death, the\nproperty interest must have passed from the\ndecedent to the spouse, and the property interest\nmust be a deductible interest. Additionally,\nthe property’s value must be ascertainable.\nIMPACT. The relatively high $5.25 million\nestate tax exclusion for 2013 for\nall estates makes addition of a marital\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nJune 27, 2013\n7\ndeduction unnecessary in the majority of\ncases. However, as Windsor showed, it is\na valuable tax benefit for larger estates.\nMany same-sex married couples may find\nit valuable to revisit their estate plans to\nmake certain that interests passing to the\nother spouse qualify for the marital deduction\nand other tax benefits.\nPortability. The American Taxpayer Relief\nAct of 2012 extended permanently the concept\nof portability, which generally allows\nthe estate of a surviving spouse to utilize the\nunused portion of the estate tax applicable\nexclusion amount of his or her last predeceased\nspouse. Because of DOMA, only\nopposite-sex married couples could take advantage\nof portability.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court’s decision\npresumably enables same-sex married\ncouples to take advantage of portability as\npart of their estate planning. The IRS is\nexpected to issue guidance.\nGifts. Because of DOMA, only oppositesex\nmarried couples were allowed to “split”\ngifts to take advantage of a doubled annual\ngift tax exclusion ($14,000 for 2013, for\na total tax-free gift of $28,000). DOMA\npresented even more of a disadvantage\nfor same-sex married couples in that only\ntransfers between spouses, where both individuals\nare U.S. citizens, are allowed an\nunlimited gift tax exclusion under Code\nSec. 2523.\nIMPACT. Same-sex married couples can\nnow presumably transfer assets between\nthemselves with no concern of lifetime gift\ntax consequences. This creates considerably\ngreater flexibility for estate planning.\nThe IRS is expected to issue guidance.\nCOMMENT. Gifts to cover medical and\neducation expenses for an individual, if\npaid directly to the medical or education\nprovider, are gift tax free without limit\nand are not counted against the annual\n$14,000 exclusion for any individual.\nCOMMENT. Where one spouse is not a\nU.S. citizen, the annual exclusion from\ngift taxes for gifts made to the noncitizen\nspouse is $143,000 for 2013.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nPerhaps in no area outside of income taxes is\nthe impact of the Supreme Court’s decision\nmore expansive than on employee benefits.\nBecause of DOMA, employers that allow an\nemployee to add his or her same-sex spouse\nto their health plan had to impute income\nto the employee for federal income tax purposes\nequal to the fair market value of health\ncoverage provided to the same-sex spouse.\nIf the same-sex spouse qualified as a dependent,\nthis rule did not apply. DOMA also\nprecluded same-sex married couples from\nsharing the same benefits of health flexible\nspending accounts, health savings accounts\nand health reimbursement arrangements\navailable to opposite-sex married couples.\nIMPACT. Employers in states that allow\nsame-sex marriage will presumably need\nto amend plans to cover same-sex married\nspouses. The IRS is expected to provide guidance\non the timing of plan amendments, including\nthe issue of whether benefits need to\nbe made retroactive or only prospective from\nthe date of the Windsor decision.\nDomestic Partners. Many employee benefit\nplans in the private and public sectors\nrefer to domestic partners rather than samesex\nspouses. The definition of domestic\npartner varies. In some cases, it may encompass\nopposite-sex domestic partners as\nwell as same-sex domestic partners.\nCOMMENT. The federal government’s\nOffice of Personnel Management defines\ndomestic partner for purposes of federal\nemployee benefits as a committed relationship\nbetween two adults, of the same sex.\nTax Treatment. Domestic partners who are\nnot married under state law are not treated\nas spouses for federal income tax purposes.\nAs a result, an employee must continue\nto pay taxes on the fair market value of\nthe coverage for the employee’s domestic\npartner (whether the domestic partner is a\nsame-sex partner or an opposite-sex partner).\nHowever, domestic partner benefits\nare tax-free if the employee’s partner qualifies\nas a dependent under Code Sec. 152;\nthat is, if benefits are paid for a person who\nmeets the following requirements:\nReceives more than half of his or her\nsupport from the taxpayer for the year.\nUses the taxpayer’s home as the principal\nabode and is a member of the taxpayer’s\nhousehold during the entire tax year.\nIs in a relationship with the taxpayer\nthat is not a violation of local law.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court’s decision\nmay open the window to refunds of taxes\npaid by employees on income imputed to\nemployees for same-sex married spouse\nand refunds of payroll taxes paid by employers\non that income. FICA tax refund\nclaims by employers and employees for\nprior, open years may also be possible.\nCOMMENT. Some employers have attempted\nto equalize the treatment between\nopposite-sex couples and same-sex\ncouples by providing so-called gross-ups\nto cover the additional taxes that samesex\ncouples pay on health benefits. Many\nemployers require an employee to certify\nthat a domestic partner qualifies as a dependent\nunder Code Sec. 152.\nCafeteria Plans. Employer contributions to\na cafeteria plan are usually made under a salary\nreduction agreement between the employer\nand the employee in which the employee agrees\nto contribute a portion of his or her salary on\na pre-tax basis to pay for the qualified benefits.\nSalary reduction contributions are not actually\nor constructively received by the participant.\nTherefore, those contributions are not considered\nwages for federal income tax purposes. In\naddition, those sums generally are not subject to\nFICA and FUTA taxes. However, pre-tax dollars\ncould not be used to pay for coverage of a\nsame-sex spouse because of DOMA. This now\nshould change as a result of the Court’s decision.\nHealth Flexible Spending Accounts. A\nhealth flexible spending arrangement (FSA)\nCCH Tax Briefing\n8\n2013 Expert Analysis\nis a form of cafeteria plan benefit, funded\nby a voluntary salary reduction arrangement\nwith pretax dollars. The benefits are\nsubject to an annual maximum and an annual\n“use-or-lose” rule. Qualified medical\nexpenses are those incurred by, among other\nindividuals, the employee and his or her\nopposite-sex spouse. Because of DOMA,\nonly opposite-sex married couples could use\nhealth FSA dollars for a spouse’s qualified\nmedical expenses.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court’s decision\nto strike down DOMA presumably opens\nthe door to same-sex married couples being\nable to use FSA dollars for qualified\nmedical expenses of both spouses. The IRS\nis expected to issue guidance.\nCOMMENT. A cafeteria plan may not\nallow an employee to request salary reduction\ncontributions for a health FSA in\nexcess of $2,500 for plan years beginning\nafter December 31, 2012.\nHealth Savings Accounts. A health savings\naccount (HSA) is a vehicle that eligible taxpayers\ncan use to pay for or reimburse qualified\nmedical expenses. Contributions to\nan HSA are tax-deductible (employer contributions\nare excluded from gross income)\nand distributions are tax-free if used to pay\nfor qualified medical expenses. To be an eligible\ntaxpayer, the individual, among other\nrequirements, must be covered by a high-deductible\nhealth plan (HDHP), not enrolled\nin Medicare, not claimed as a dependent on\nanother taxpayer’s return. Qualified medical\nexpenses are those incurred by, among\nothers, the taxpayer and his or her spouse.\nBecause of DOMA, only opposite-sex married\ncouples could HSA dollars for a spouse’s\nqualified medical expenses.\nIMPACT. With DOMA being struck\ndown by the Supreme Court, same-sex\nmarried couples will presumably be able\nto use HSA dollars for qualified medical\nexpenses of both spouses.\nCOBRA/FMLA. Federal law requires that\ncertain employers offer continuation of health\ncare coverage to employees, their spouses,\nand families (“COBRA coverage’). Current\nfederal laws related to COBRA coverage do\nnot apply to same-sex married couples. The\nDOMA definition of spouse precludes the\nextension of Family and Medical Leave Act\n(FMLA) leave benefits to opposite-sex partners.\nAfter the Supreme Court’s decision in\nWindsor, these rights presumably would now\nbe available to same-sex spouses.\n“The IRS is expected\nto provide guidance on\nthe timing of employee\nbenefit plan amendments,\nincluding the issue of\nwhether benefits need to\nbe made retroactive or\nonly prospective.”\nRetirement Plans. The Internal Revenue\nCode provides extensive protections\nfor the spouse of an employee to share in\nthe employee’s retirement benefits payable\nthrough Code Sec. 401(k) plans and other\nqualified plans. These protections would\npresumably now apply to the same-sex\nspouse of an employee.\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct, signed into law by President Obama\nin 2010, set in motion a host of changes to\nthe delivery of health care and health insurance\ncoverage. Some of the changes already\nin place affect health savings accounts (discussed\nabove in this Briefing). Other changes\nare scheduled to take effect after 2013.\nIndividual Mandate And Penalty. Beginning\nin 2014, the Affordable Care Act\nimposes a penalty on individuals who do\nnot carry minimum essential health coverage\nfor one or more months, subject\nto certain exceptions. Married taxpayers\nwho file a joint return are jointly liable\nfor any penalty that may be imposed\nupon either spouse. The penalty does not\napply in certain cases, such as in the case\nof individuals whose household incomes\nare below their filing thresholds. Now\nthat DOMA has been struck down, samesex\nmarried couples presumably will be\ntreated in the same manner as oppositesex\nmarried couples for purposes of the\nindividual mandate and its penalty.\nCOMMENT. The Affordable Care Act prohibits\nthe IRS from using liens or levies to\ncollect any unpaid penalty. The IRS cannot\nlevy on the property of one spouse to satisfy\nan unpaid penalty of the other spouse.\nPremium Assistance Tax Credit. Beginning\nin 2014, the Code Sec. 36B premium assistance\ntax credit is scheduled to be available\nto those qualified individuals and families\nwho are not offered minimum essential coverage\nand as a result obtain coverage through\na health benefit exchange. The Affordable\nCare Act provides for advance payment of\nthe credit. Taxpayers who are married at the\nend of the tax year must file a joint return\nto claim the credit. Because DOMA has\nbeen struck down, same-sex married couples\nwill presumably need to file a joint return to\nclaim the credit.\nCode Sec. 45R Credit. For tax years 2010\nthrough 2013, eligible employers may claim\na credit of 35 percent of health insurance\npremiums paid (25 percent for small taxexempt\nemployers). In tax years beginning\nafter 2013, an employer must participate in\nan insurance exchange in order to claim the\ncredit. The credit is scheduled to increase\nto 50 percent for small business employers\n(35 percent for small tax-exempt employers)\nafter 2013 (but will terminate after 2015).\nCertain family members are not treated as\nemployees for purposes of the credit. Under\nDOMA, these restrictions did not apply\nto same-sex married couples because their\nmarriages were not recognized for federal\npurposes. With DOMA’s demise, a samesex\nspouse who satisfies any of these criteria\nwould presumably not be treated as an employee\nfor purposes of the credit.\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nJune 27, 2013\n9\nSOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS\nBecause of DOMA, same-sex married couples\ndid not have the same benefits under\nSocial Security that opposite-sex married\ncouples have enjoyed for many years. Unlike\nopposite-sex couples, for example, there are\nno survivor benefits for the surviving spouse\nof a same-sex married couple. Also, the divorced\nspouse of a formerly married samesex\ncouple cannot not claim benefits based\non the earnings of his or her ex-spouse.\nIMPACT. The Social Security Administration\n(SSA) has based federal rights to\nbenefits on whether marital rights exist\nin the couple’s current state of residence\nrather than the state in which they were\nmarried. The impact of Windsor on the\nmanner in which federal agencies will\ntreat Social Security benefits remains to\nbe sorted out.\nSurvivor Benefits. When an individual\ndies, his or her surviving spouse may be\neligible for Social Security benefits if the\nsurviving spouse is age 60 or older, age 50\nor older and disabled, or any age if he or\nshe is caring for the decedent’s child who is\nyounger than age 16 or disabled and entitled\nto Social Security benefits on the record\nof the deceased individual. With DOMA\nhaving been struck down, survivor benefits\npreviously available only to opposite-sex\nmarried couples are now presumably available\nto same-sex married couples. The SSA\nis expected to provide guidance.\nDivorced Spouses. If an individual is divorced,\nhis or her ex-spouse may qualify\nfor Social Security benefits based on that\nindividual’s earnings. Generally, a divorced\nspouse must have been married to the individual\nfor at least 10 years and have been\ndivorced at least two years. Additionally,\nthe divorced spouse must be at least age\n62, unmarried and ineligible for an equal\nor greater benefit based on his or her own\nearnings or the earnings of someone else.\nThese benefits are now presumably available\nto divorced individuals who were previously\nin a same-sex marriage. The SSA is expected\nto provide guidance.\nDeath Benefits. The SSA pays a onetime\ndeath benefit of $255 to the decedent’s\nsurviving spouse in an opposite-sex\nmarriage or minor child. The SSA will\npresumably now pay the one-time death\nbenefit to the surviving spouse in a samesex\nmarriage.\nEFFECTIVE-DATE ISSUES\nDetermination of the effective date for applying\nthe Supreme Court’s holding to federal\ntax law is not straightforward in all cases\nand will necessitate further guidance from\nthe IRS. Same-sex married couples who\nwere not considered married under federal\nlaw prior to the Supreme Court decision\nare presumably not just considered married\nstarting on the date of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision, June 26, 2013 but are considered\nmarried retroactively to the date of their\nmarriage pursuant to state law. This retroactive\neffective date raises a number of immediate\nfederal tax issues:\nShould same-sex couples now file\namended returns claiming joint return\nstatus?\nAre same-sex couples now required to\namend past-year returns for joint status\neven if they did better tax-wise overall\nby filing separately as unmarried individuals?\nWill the IRS consider the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in determining marital\nstatus when auditing prior-year returns?\nAmended Joint Returns/Claims For Refund.\nAmended returns are filed to correct\nerrors made on previous returns. Although\nthe Internal Revenue Code does not specifically\npermit amended returns, the IRS usually\naccepts them. But while the IRS’s discretion\nto accept or reject amended returns\nhas been recognized, courts have required\nthe IRS to accept amended returns where\nits rejection of them has been found to be\narbitrary and unjust.\nLimitations Period. The statute of limitations\nfor amending or auditing a return is\nSTATES THAT\nRECOGNIZE SAME-SEX\nMARRIAGE\nConnecticut\nDelaware(1)\nIowa\nMaine\nMaryland\nMassachusetts\nMinnesota(2)\nNew Hampshire\nNew York\nRhode Island(2)\nVermont\nWashington\nDistrict of Columbia\n*As of June 27, 2013\n(1) Effective July 1, 2013\n(2) Effective August 1, 2013\nNote: California granted marriage licenses\nto same-sex couples from June\n16, 2008 to November 5, 2008.\nNote: The Little Traverse Bay Bands of\nOdawa Indians in Michigan, the Coquille\nNative American Nation in Oregon and\nthe Suquamish Native American Nation in\nWashington recognize same-sex marriage.\nNote: 37 States have laws expressly\nrestricting marriage to opposite-sex\ncouples.\nSTATES THAT\nRECOGNIZE SAME-SEX\nUNIONS/DOMESTIC\nPARTNERSHIPS\nCalifornia\nColorado\nHawaii\nIllinois\nNevada\nNew Jersey\nOregon\nWisconsin\ngenerally three years from the filing date or\ntwo years from the date taxes are paid, whichever\nis later. This rule may generally apply for\nsame-sex married couples as follows:\nCCH Tax Briefing\n10\n2013 Expert Analysis\nJoint returns may be filed, usually as an\namended return with a refund claim,\nuntil the three-year limitations period\n(or the two-year payment period, if\nlater) expires. For individuals who filed\n2009 tax returns on or before April\n15, 2010, the limitations period for\nthat year is closed. For those who filed\ntheir 2009 returns on an automatic sixmonth\nextension on October 15, 2010,\nhowever, the limitations period for the\n2009 tax year remains open until October\n15, 2013. To claim joint return\nstatus on an amended 2009 tax return\nunder the three-year rule, both married\npartners’ original tax returns must have\nbeen filed within that extended period.\nTaxpayers who filed protective refund\nclaims prior to the Supreme Court’s decision\nshould be on the alert to any forthcoming\nIRS guidelines that may facilitate\nthe agency’s processing of those claims.\nTaxpayers who had a lower combined\noverall tax liability filing as unmarried single\nindividuals during an open year appear\nto be under no obligation now to file an\namended return to file jointly (or as married\nfiling separately if at least one partner\ndoes not consent to a joint return).\nIRS Audit Policy. Technically, the IRS, on\naudit of an open year for which any previously-filed\nreturn by a married, same-sex\npartner used unmarried, single-filer status,\nmay be able to require that tax be recomputed\nbased on either a joint return, or married\nfiling separately status return. However,\nsince audits are under IRS’s discretionary\npowers, the consensus among at least some\npractitioners, is that IRS National Office\nmay –and more likely will— direct agents\nto by-pass any filing-status issues unless the\ntaxpayer requests a change.\n2013 Tax Year. For 2013 returns that will be\nfiled in 2014, the Supreme Court’s Windsor\ndecision presumably relates back to the entire\n2013 tax year in determining filing status.\nCOMMENT. Married partners do not have\nthe option to file short-year returns as unmarried\nfor the January 1 – June 26, 2013\nperiod; they must file jointly or married filing\nseparately for the entire 2013 tax year.\n2012 Tax Year. Taxpayers who are on extension\nuntil October 15, 2013 for filing their\n2012 tax year returns appear to be required\nto file those returns either jointly or married\nfiling separately. Taxpayers who filed their\n2012 tax year returns before June 26, 2013,\nas separate, unmarried individuals, however,\nmay not need to change their filing status to\nmarried filing joint if it would be less favorable\nto their overall tax liability. The IRS\nmay issue guidance on this issue.\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.",
