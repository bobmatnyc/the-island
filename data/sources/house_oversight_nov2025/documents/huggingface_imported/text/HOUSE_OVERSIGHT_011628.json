Amit died in\nthe fighting near Ismailia, at the northern end of the canal, as Arik Sharon’s\nunits pushed on after the crossing. The day before the end of the war, both\nAmitai and Amiram Levin were part of an operation to take over the Fayid Air\nBase across the canal. When an Egyptian RPG hit their Jeep, Amiram was\nwounded. Amitai was killed.\n\nI thought, too, of Yishai Izhar: the friend struck down beside me, who I’d\ncradled in my arms on the top of my tank, trying to stop the bleeding.\n\n“Oh Ehud,” Nava said. “It’s like 1967 all over again.”\n“No,” I said. “Worse. Much worse.”\n\nA few weeks later, | was coming out of the kirya when I ran into another\nfriend, whom I’d first met at Hebrew University. Like me, he had been a junior\nofficer in 1967. His name was Ron Ben-Ishai. He would go on to become a top\njournalist, covering the military for Israel’s best-selling newspaper, Yediot\nAchronot. In the early autumn of 1967, we were still transfixed by the idea of\nbeing able to visit areas of biblical Israel, which for years had been under\nJordanian rule.

I’d fought in it. Ron, as what\nis now called an embedded journalist, had been with Danny Matt’s paratroopers\nwhen they’d crossed the canal. He was alongside another of Arik’s units\nfighting out of the bridgehead on the far bank of the canal. That both of us had\nseen terrible suffering over the past few weeks did not need saying. But Ron\nsaid he wanted to show me something. Fishing into his wallet, he took out a\ncarefully folded photograph. He had taken it in 1967, just six years earlier, to\nmark our Judaean trek. There we were. All nine of us. Young. Full of optimism.\nAnd probably a bit full of ourselves as well.\n\nRon and I were the only two left alive.\n\nWe had won the war, and not just because our forces were now within 60\nmiles of Cairo, and only 25 from Damascus.
