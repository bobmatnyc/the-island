  "text": "/ BARAK / 38\n\nredeployments — on only the /and part of a land-for-peace deal — meant we risked\nignoring the core issues that would determine whether a full peace agreement was\nachievable.\n\nMore urgently, I knew from our diplomats in the US that the Americans would\nnot necessarily be receptive to a further delay in moving ahead with Oslo, even if it\nmeant focusing on trying to make peace with Syria. That made my first visit to see\nPresident Clinton as Prime Minister especially important.\n\nIt was billed as a “working visit” and work we did. After a gala dinner for Nava\nand me in the White House, we helicoptered to the presidential retreat at Camp\nDavid. President Clinton and I spent more than 10 hours discussing shared security\nchallenges in the Middle East, especially terrorist groups and states like Iran that\nwere backing them, and, of course, how best to move forward our efforts to\nnegotiate peace. These face-to-face meetings set a pattern that would last\nthroughout the time he and I were in office. On almost all key issues, my\npreference was to deal directly with the President, something I know sometimes\nfrustrated other senior US negotiators like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\nand Mideast envoy Dennis Ross. This was not out of any disrespect for them. It\nwas because the decisions on which negotiations would succeed or fail would have\nto be made at the top, just as President Clinton and I would ultimately carry the\nresponsibility, or the blame, for errors, missteps or missed opportunities.\n\nOur first meeting ran until three in the morning. When the President asked me\nhow I saw the peace process going forward, he smiled, in obviously relief, at my\nanswer: I wanted to move quickly. He had only a limited time left in office, and I\nwas determined that we not waste it. Much is often made about the personal\n“chemistry” in political relationships. Too much, I think, because the core issues,\nand the trade-offs of substance, are what truly matter when negotiating matters of\nthe weight, and long-term implications, of Middle East peace. Still, chemistry does\nhelp when moments of tension or crisis arise, as they inevitably do. My first few\ndays with President Clinton laid a foundation that allowed us to work together even\nwhen things got tough. I benefited, I’m sure, simply by not being Bibi.
