  "text": "decide that my opening line will then be, “I just want to say that freedom\nof expression existed long before the First Amendment.” Though it’ s not\nmy motivation, | realize that this opening line will undoubtedly please\nRobert McGinley, the bearded co-founder and president of the Lifestyles\nOrganization.\n\n“We hate government intervention in our lives,” he has assured\nme. “We hate censorship. We’ re against laws that require helmets for\ncyclists. It’ s good that a law was just passed allowing women to\nbreastfeed in public, but we shouldn’ t need permission from the\n\nu\n\ngovernment to do it.” He admits to being “libertarian, but not\nLibertarian Party.” He draws his philosophy from Jack London— “The\nproper function of man is to live, not to exist” —and, more specifically, his\ncredo is “Adult sexuality is normal.” Dr. McGinley (he holds a Ph.D. in\ncounseling psychology) tells me a riddle: “What do you call an Italian\nswinger?” | give up. The answer: “A swop.”\n\nAt the luncheon, it turns out that | will mot be presented with the\nFreedom Award after all, and | have to come up immediately with a\nreplacement opening line: “I'’ m delighted to be at the Lifestyles\n\nConvention—this is the first convention |’ ve ever been to that was named\n\nafter a condom.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015199",
