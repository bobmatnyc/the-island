  "text": "834\n\ndant Dallah Al Baraka Group, which is\nchaired by Defendant Saleh Abdullah Ka-\nmel. Saudi American Bank is close to the\nSaudi Bin Laden family, ... appears on its\nfinancial transactions” and provides bank-\ning services to its Sudanese operations.\nAshton Complaint 11 607-8; Burnett Com-\nplaint 19 144, 146.\n\n“In the year 2000, the Saudi American\nBank participated in the fundraising cam-\npaign in Saudi Arabia for collecting dona-\ntions to the ‘heroes of the Al Quds upris-\ning’ (Intifada) by providing a bank account\nand facilities to receive donations for a\ncommittee of charity organizations includ-\ning Defendants WAMY, ITRO and Al Har-\namain Foundation.” Ashton Complaint\n1609; Burnett Complaint 1 147.\n\nThe essence of Plaintiffs’ claim is that\nthrough its relationships with other banks\nand support of the Saudi Binladin group’s\nwork in Sudan, Saudi American Bank pro-\nvided material support to al Qaeda. It is\nnot alleged to have done anything to di-\nrectly support al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden,\nor their terrorist agenda. As the Court\nhas stated before, there can be no bank\nliability for injuries caused by money rou-\ntinely passing through the bank. Saudi\nAmerican Bank is not alleged to have\nknown that anything relating to terrorism\nwas occurring through the services it pro-\nvided. The Ashton Plaintiffs have dis-\nmissed their claims against Ahmed Nur Ali\nJumale, allegedly an associate of Osama\nbin Laden. To the extent the Burnett\nPlaintiffs continue their claims against\nhim, his employment at Saudi American\nBank from 1979 to 1986 cannot be grounds\nfor relief. Osama bin Laden did not orga-\nnize al Qaeda until the late 1980s, Saudi\nAmerican Bank is not alleged to have pro-\nvided Jumale with a veil of legitimacy or\nshelter. Cf Burnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at\n104 (finding Al Haramain’s employment of\nal Qaeda operative during height of al\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nQaeda activity a sufficient allegation of\nproviding material support). The com-\nplaints have provided Saudi American\nBank with no notice of Plaintiffs’ claims or\ngrounds for relief. Accordingly, Saudi\nAmerican Bank’s motions to dismiss the\nAshton and Burnett complaints are grant-\ned in their entirety.\n\n3. Arab Bank\n\n[97] The Federal Plaintiffs claim Arab\nBank is a financial institution headquar-\ntered in Egypt with branch offices\nthroughout the world, including New York.\nFederal Complaint 1357. Arab Bank\nclaims it is actually a Jordanian bank\nheadquartered in Amman, Jordan. Arab\nBank allegedly has “long provided finan-\ncial services and other forms of material\nsupport to terrorist organizations, includ-\ning al Qaeda.” Federal Complaint 1358.\nFurther, these Plaintiffs allege that the\nSeptember 11 attacks were a “direct, in-\ntended and foreseeable product of Arab\nBank’s participation in al Qaeda’s jihadist\ncampaign.” Jd. 11364, 363. These claims\nare based on the allegation that Arab Bank\nhas “long known that accounts it main-\ntained were being used to solicit and trans-\nfer funds to terrorist organizations [and\ndespite this knowledge] Arab Bank has\ncontinued to maintain those accounts.” Id.\n1362. Specifically, the Federal Plaintiffs\nclaim Arab Bank accounts have been used\nfor al Qaeda money transfers throughout\nthe world and that Arab Bank maintains\naccounts for Defendant charities including\nIIRO, MWL, WAMY, BIF, Blessed Relief\n(Muwaffaq) Foundation, and Al Haramain.\nId. 9359, 360. Israeli officials allegedly\nhave seized funds associated with several\nArab Bank accounts maintained on behalf\nof known fronts for Hamas and identified\nby Arab Bank employees, “confirming the\nbank’s specific knowledge that accounts it\nmaintained were being used to sponsor\nterrorist activity.” Id. 1361.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017899",
