  "text": "Over nearly four decades, Stephen Wolfram has been a pioneer in the development and\napplication of computational thinking and responsible for many innovations in science,\ntechnology and business.\n\nHis 1982 paper “Cellular Automata as Simple Self-Organizing Systems,” written\nat the age of twenty-three, was the first of numerous significant scientific contributions\naimed at understanding the origins of complexity in nature.\n\nIt was around this time that Stephen briefly came into my life. I had established\nThe Reality Club, an informal gathering of intellectuals who met in New York City to\npresent their work before peers in other disciplines. (Note: In 1996, The Reality Club\nwent online as Edge.org). Our first speaker? Stephen Wolfram, a “wunderkind” who\nhad arrived in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. I distinctly recall his\nfocused manner as he sat down on a couch in my living room and spoke uninterrupted for\nabout an hour before the assembled group.\n\nSince that time, Stephen has become intent making the world’s knowledge easily\ncomputable and accessible. His program Mathematica is the definitive system for\nmodern technical computing. Wolfram|Alpha computes expert-level answers using AI\ntechnology. He considers his Wolfram Language to be the first true computational\ncommunication language for humans and AIs.\n\nI caught up with him again four years ago, when we arranged to meet in\nCambridge, Massachusetts, for a freewheeling conversation about Al. Stephen walked\nin, said hello, sat down, and, looking at the video camera set up to record the\nconversation for Edge, began to talk and didn’t stop for two and a half hours.\n\nThe essay that follows is an edited version of that session, which was a Wolfram\nmaster class of sorts and is an appropriate way to end this volume—just as Stephen’s\nReality Club talk in the ’80s was a great way to initiate the ongoing intellectual\nenterprise whose result is the rich community of thinkers presenting their work to one\nanother and to the public in this book.\n\n181\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016401",
