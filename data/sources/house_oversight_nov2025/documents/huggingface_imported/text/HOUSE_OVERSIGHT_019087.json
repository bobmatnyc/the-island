  "text": "And not everyone is inclined to support the same causes. A fundraiser and\npublic relations expert of extraordinary ability recognizes this—can find,\ntarget, and approach the correct people for their cause, and then recruit them\nwith the correct individual enticements. Repeating myself, this is a very\ndifficult thing to pull off. Hillwas able to pull this off amazingly, not only\nwith great efficiency and success, but with also great ease and grace; and she\nis on a roll—and it doesn’t look like she will stop anytime soon.\n\nThese are my qualified opinions: I am no stranger to raising money for\nchildren. Every year, I travel all across the country and the world to perform\nmagic for children’s hospital wards, burn units and juvenile wards, including\nSpofford, Bridges, Horizon, and Crossroads. I spent time performing magic\nfor Paul Newman and the children diagnosed with serious illnesses at the\nHole in the Wall Gang Camp, among many other charitable activities.\n\nI’ve been discussing with HB how we can work together in raising\nmoney for children and education. Therefore, | wholeheartedly support her\nvisa application. If her visa application is approved, I don’t see why we\nwouldn’t combine our unique forms of magic and help the world’s children!\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or\nconcerns.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nDavid Blaine\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019087",
