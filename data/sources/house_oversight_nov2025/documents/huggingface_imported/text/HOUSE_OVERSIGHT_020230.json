  "text": "78\n\nGreenwald was an activist as well as a journalist. Like Poitras, he joined the board of directors\nof the Freedom of the Press Foundation. The foundation, which eventually Runa Sandvik and\nMicah Lee would join, had been set up expressly to funnel money to both Assange’s Wikileaks\nsite and the defense fund for Bradley Manning after he was arrested. Such a money laundry was\nnecessary because, as will be recalled, American credit card companies were blocking money\ntransfers to these two causes. This “blockade” was taking its toll on Wikileaks. According to\nAssange, “WikiLeaks had been cut off from more than 90 percent of its finances.” So the\nFreedom of the Press Foundation came to its rescue. John Perry Barlow, one of the song writers\nfor the Grateful Dead band, was one of its chief financial backers. “The first serious info war is\nnow engaged, Barlow declared. “The field of battle is WikiLeaks.” He served with Greenwald and\nPoitras on its Board in December 2012.\n\nSnowden was an avid reader of Greenwald’s screeds against the government. If he was to\nassume the role of a modern-day Prometheus, delivering forbidden secrets of the NSA to the\npublic, Greenwald would be a logical candidate to break the story. Snowden could safely assume\nthat Greenwald would be sympathetic to exposing NSA surveillance from his many blogs, tweets\nand YouTube comments on the subject. For example, on November 13 2012, just 18 days before\nSnowden contacted him, Greenwald had written a blog in Guardian asserting that the United\nStates was “a surveillance state run amok.” In it, echoing very closely what Snowden said at his\nCrypto party, Greenwald wrote that “any remnants of internet anonymity have been all but\nobliterated by the union between the state and technology companies.” Citing a story in the\nWashington Post, he continued: “Every day, collection systems at the National Security Agency\nintercept and store 1.7 billion e-mails, phone calls and other types of communications.\" Asa\nresult, Greenwald called for action in his blog on November 13, 2012, writing: “The US\noperates a sprawling, unaccountable Surveillance State that, in violent breach of the core\nguarantees of the Fourth Amendment, monitors and records virtually everything even the most\nlaw-abiding citizens do.” That same week Snowden invited Runa Sandvik to co-host his crypto\n\nparty.\n\nOne problem for Snowden was reaching out to Greenwald was Greenwald's lack of any\nencryption for his e-mails. Communicating with a journalist like Greenwald who famously\nattacked the very organization for which he worked was itself a risky undertaking, especially if he\nwanted to pass classified NSA documents to him. If his emails were intercepted by the NSA in\nBrazil (where Greenwald lived) and where the NSA was not restricted by US law, he could lose\nhis job or even be arrested. Under his alias Cincinnatus, he told Greenwald that he needed to\nimmediately encrypt his computer. To make his point, he cited Greenwald’s own November 12,\n2012 blog. In it, Greenwald noted that General David Petraeus, then the CIA director, had been\ncaught in a minor sex scandal because his personal emails had been intercepted, Snowden wrote\nGreenwald that Petraeus would not have been exposed if he had used encryption. Snowden also\nsent Greenwald instruction on how to install the necessary encryption software and a link to a 12-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020230",
