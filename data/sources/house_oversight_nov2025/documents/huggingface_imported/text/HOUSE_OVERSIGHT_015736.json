  "text": "46 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nnothing; no wind chill, nothing. The air was so hot the wind carried no\nheat from my hand. When I imagine hot weather it always brings back\nthis memory. It’s my conscious experience of the world.\n\nHumans experience the world through a vivid lens we call\nconsciousness. It allows us to think about the world as we watch it and\nplan actions. But, it also summons associated memories, something\nscientists call ‘qualia. Most writers describe consciousness as an internal\ndialogue with themselves and see it as a consequence of human language.\nThat's probably because most writers are linguists. Non-linguists, perhaps\neven dyslexic engineers like me, experience consciousness as more of a\nvisual dialogue.\n\nIt’s hard to pin down consciousness as the difference between\nhumans and computers. Computers do have something that resembles\nconsciousness; they have watchdog functions, they plan and anticipate\nactions and are aware of their own existence. But they don’t understand\nor make free choices based on this consciousness. It is an entirely\nmechanistic affair. A computer might know its CPU is overheating and\nsend a notification message to the administrator, but it does not really\nappreciate what this means. It does not have our sensation of a near death\nexperience. This self-awareness is the ‘hard question of consciousness.\nWhy, despite the computer knowing it is overheating, does this not\ntranslate into the intense experience we have? Philosophers, such as\nDaniel Dennett, think this lack of consciousness is only a matter of time;\nonce computers live long enough and have sufficient internal complexity\nthey will begin to experience the world the way we do. We are nothing\nspecial.\n\nThe problem with consciousness is it does not seem to have any\nexternally discernible effect. Anesthetics can take it away and brain\nscanners can see that it has been switched off, but what is it for? I think it\ncomes hand in hand with our faculty of creativity. Consciousness allows\nus to shape the world — not the other way round.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015736",
