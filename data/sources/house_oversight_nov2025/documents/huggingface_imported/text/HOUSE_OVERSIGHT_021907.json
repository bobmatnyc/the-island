I mean, I want to\nmake -- I want to make clear that there was a lot\nof information that I was relying on in filing\nthis pleading, and of course, the later pleading.\nSo we are on the subject of flight logs.\n\nFlight logs showed that the flight logs that\nMr. Dershowitz had produced to Detective Riccari\nwere incomplete and inaccurate. And so that led\nto concern on my part that Mr. Dershowitz had had\nan opportunity to sanitize the flight logs, had\nprovided incomplete production, you know,\nobviously, very important production that the\nPalm Beach Police Department was looking at.\n\nThen we got some additional flight logs from\nDave Rogers.
