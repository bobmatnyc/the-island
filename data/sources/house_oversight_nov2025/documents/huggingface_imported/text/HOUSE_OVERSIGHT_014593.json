In comparison,\ncountries with less exposure to the US economy\nand already strong domestic demand, such as India\nand Indonesia, would likely fare better.\n\nExhibit 70: 2016 Currency Moves (vs. US Dollar)\n\nAgainst this uncertain backdrop and\nconsidering today's uninspiring valuations (see\nExhibit 69), we remain tactically neutral on\nemerging market equities. That said, we continue\nto explore relative investment opportunities that\nexploit the significant domestic activity, external\nvulnerability and valuation differences among\nindividual emerging countries.\n\n2017 Global Currency Outlook\n\nIn a notable departure from recent years, the\nUS dollar did not enjoy unequivocal dominance\nin 2016 (see Exhibit 70). The yen, for example,\nended a four-year slide against the greenback as\nthe market questioned the BOJ’s commitment\nto monetary easing. Certain emerging market\ncurrencies—such as the Russian ruble and Brazilian\nreal—also outperformed the dollar on the back of\nstronger commodity prices and favorable political\ndevelopments at home. And while the dollar did\nmake notable gains against the euro, pound and\nMexican peso in particular, these currencies enter\n2017 with a more balanced risk/reward profile\nas a result.\n\nThe upshot is that while tightening monetary\npolicy and potential fiscal expansion in the US\nwill continue to favor dollar strength, those\ngains are likely to be more modest and reflected\nin a narrower set of currencies as the dollar bull\nmarket enters its fifth year. Our tactical positioning\n\nFor the first time in several years, the US dollar did not appreciate against all major currencies.\n\n2016 Spot Return (%)\n\nG10 EM Asia EM EMEA EM Latin America\n25 20 22\n20 >\nCn ae 13\nAppreciation\n10 + 6 6\n5] 2 2 3 8 1 2 2 2\no _— qa=== ==\nca 3 2 rao 2 3\n40 4 7 6 7 6\n-15 4\n29 J -16 7 -17\n$$ s € @ 8s s s 38 € @ € §$§ 8 € & gs § s 2 = g 8 § 2 8 8\nBr Es a 4 oe Ses 2 Fea f = 2 22 3 sf SE a\nte ge < = 2 zs eer 8 = = 3\nwn\n\nNew Zealand\n\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n\nCzech Republic\nSouth Africa\n\n60 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014593",
