The importance of the Suez was such that the presence of a\nhostile, major naval force in the eastern Mediterranean represented a\ndirect threat to British interests. It followed that defeating the\nOttoman Empire during World War I and breaking its residual naval\npower was critical. The British, as was shown at Gallipoli, lacked the\nresources to break the Ottoman Empire by main force. They resorted\nto a series of alliances with local forces to undermine the Ottomans.\nOne was an alliance with Bedouin tribes in the Arabian Peninsula;\nothers involved covert agreements with anti-Turkish, Arab interests\nfrom the Levant to the Persian Gulf.
