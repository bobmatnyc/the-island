December 11, 2000, PBI to Teterboro,\npassengers, Jeffrey Epstein --\n\nA. Wait asecond. | have to find it.\n\nMR. SCOTT: Well, let him -- let him read\nthe exhibit.\nA. What -- what's the date?\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\n\nQ. December 11.\n\nA. December 11. Yes, I see that.\n\nQ. Palm Beach International Airport to\nTeterboro?\n\nA. Right, yeah.\n\nQ. Passengers, Jeffrey Epstein?\n\nA. Right,\n\nQ. GM, a reference to Ghislaine -- excuse me,\nGhislaine Maxwell.\n\nA. Uh-huh.\n\nQ. And ET and Virginia, right?\n\nA. That's what it says, yes, sir.\n\nQ. And then we see three of the same four\npassengers leaving the New York area.\n\nA. Uh-huh.\n\nQ. To fly to another destination three days\nlater on December 14, correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\n318\n\nQ. And let's look at the next page of your\nwife's diary for December 13, the period of time\nwhen the flight log shows Jeffrey Epstein and\nVirginia in New York --\n\nA. Uh-huh.\n\nQ. --at the same time when it would appear\nthat you were in New York. And at the bottom of\nthis calendar, Wednesday, December 13, A.D.,\nmassage, right?\n\nA. 10:00 a.m. it says? What is it?\n\nQ. It says 10, 10-A.D. massage?\n\nA. Yeah.\n\nQ. Okay.\n\nLet's go to the next composite.\n\nA. I don't have -- there's another page after\nthat. Oh, the next composite.\n\nQ. Yes, sir.\n\nA. Yeah.\n\nQ. Composite Number 10.\n\nA. Uh-huh. But -- but I just want to be\nclear. So you're saying Carolyn was with me in\nNew York during that period of time.\n\nQ. No, I'm not saying that at all, sir. I\nsuggest that when we take a close look at the\ncalendar, it's going to reveal something other than\n\n319\n\nthat, but that you were in New York at the same time\nJeffrey Epstein --\n\nA. And that Carolyn --\n\nQ. -- and Virginia were in New York and you\nwere --\n\nA. And that Carolyn arranged for a massage.\n\nQ. — having a massage.\n\nA, And that my wife arranged for a massage.\n\nQ. No, I didn't say that at all, sir?\n\nMR. SCOTT: Well, that’s what he's saying\n\nthat the record reflects.\n\nA. The record --\n\nMR. SCOTT: Don't cut him off.\n\nA. -- reflects that Carolyn -- Carolyn always\nwanted me to have massages because she thought it\nwould relax me. I don't like massages particularly,\nbut when Carolyn arranged massages, almost always we\nhad them together at the same time. We would have\nthe same masseuse, sometimes a man, sometimes a\nwoman, come to the house and give us massages\ntogether.\n\nThe idea that my wife would arrange for me\nto have a massage with an underage girl for sexual\npurposes is so bizarre and absurd as to defy any\nkind of credibility, but go on.\n\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\nQ. Yes. Thank you very much, sir.\nA. Goon.\nQ. Lintend --\n\nMR. SCOTT: Since you're both smiling,\nthere seemis to be some humor that I'm missing\nhere. I guess I --\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Well, I'm missing the humor\ntoo.\n\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\nQ. Let's go to Composite Exhibit Number 10.\nA. Yeah.\nQ. The first page of that composite exhibit\n\nis a photocopy of pages from your personal calendar\n\nin January 2001, correct?\nA. That's right, yes.\nQ. Another Court TV appearance on January 11,\ncorrect?\nA. January 1}.\nQ. Yes, sir. Thursday, January 11, entry in\nthe left-hand column, Court TV.\nA. Entry on -- yes, January -- I see it as --\nI see it on January 12. I don't sec it on\nJanuary 11, but...\n\n36 (Pages 317 to 320)\n\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888) 811-3408\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010818",
