As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still\ntalking about a “reform agenda” in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were\na slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly\n1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White\nHouse has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say\none word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a\nsmall matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime’s repression\nand giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately\ncirculate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria,\nmeanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him\nto step down.\n\nWhy is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing\nto call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-\nSyrian peace deal can be arranged.\n\nFrom the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly\nwanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been\nno progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White\nHouse insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank\nsettlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This\nwas politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian\npresident Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear\nto be asking less from Israel than the Americans.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031835",
