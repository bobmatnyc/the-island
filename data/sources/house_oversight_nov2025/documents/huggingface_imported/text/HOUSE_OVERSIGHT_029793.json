  "text": "party. So let’s clear the air right now,\nwell before the festivities. Before we get\nto the matter of coalition politics, which\nis very much on our minds right now as\nNetanyahu struggles to put together a\ngovernment, let us consider the other\nnegative part of the Peres legacy: his stint\nas Defense Minister under Prime Minister\nYitzhak Rabin from 1974 to 1977. Today\nPeres is widely respected as the architect\nof the Oslo Accord of 1993, achieved\nwhile he was Foreign Minister. It was the\nfirst political move toward a settlement\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, and\nPeres deserves huge credit for securing\nthe agreement. However, two decades\nearlier, as Defense Minister, he supported\nthe Jewish settlement project in the\nnewly-conquered Palestinian territories,\nboth overtly and covertly. Not for\nnothing did Rabin label Peres in his\nmemoirs as “an indefatigable intriguer.”\nIn 1975, while Rabin was doing his\nutmost to prevent the settlement of Elon\nMoreh, near Nablus, Peres continuously\nsabotaged his efforts. After no less than\neight settlement attempts, which were\nruled illegal by Israel’s Supreme Court, a\n“compromise” was reached, and Elon\nMoreh was established five kilometers to\nthe east of the original site. Moreover,\nduring the furor over Elon Moreh,\nDefense Minister Peres quietly facilitated\nthe creation of Ofra, near Ramallah.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029793",
