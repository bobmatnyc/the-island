  "text": "before a Trump-size crowd, was a political flatliner. It was a full-on Trump speech, ninety\nminutes of rambling and improvisation—the wall would be built (now it was a see-\nthrough wall), Russian interference in the U.S. election was a hoax, he would fire anybody\non his cabinet who supported Moore. But, while his base turned out en masse, still drawn\nto Trump the novelty, his cheerleading for Luther Strange drew at best a muted response.\nAs the crowd became restless, the event threatened to become a hopeless embarrassment.\n\nReading his audience and desperate to find a way out, Trump suddenly threw out a line\nabout Colin Kaepernick taking to his knee while the national anthem played at a National\nFootball League game. The line got a standing ovation. The president thereupon promptly\nabandoned Luther Strange for the rest of the speech. Likewise, for the next week he\ncontinued to whip the NFL. Pay no attention to Strange’s resounding defeat five days after\nthe event in Huntsville. Ignore the size and scale of Trump’s rejection and the Moore-\nBannon triumph, with its hint of new disruptions to come. Now Trump had a new topic,\nand a winning one: the Knee.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nThe fundamental premise of nearly everybody who joined the Trump White House was,\nThis can work. We can help make this work. Now, only three-quarters of the way through\njust the first year of Trump’s term, there was literally not one member of the senior staff\nwho could any longer be confident of that premise. Arguably—and on many days\nindubitably—most members of the senior staff believed that the sole upside of being part\nof the Trump White House was to help prevent worse from happening.\n\nIn early October, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s fate was sealed—if his obvious\nambivalence toward the president had not already sealed it—by the revelation that he had\ncalled the president “a fucking moron.”\n\nThis—insulting Donald Trump’s intelligence—was both the thing you could not do and\nthe thing—drawing there-but-for-the-grace-of-God guffaws across the senior staff—that\neverybody was guilty of. Everyone, in his or her own way, struggled to express the baldly\nobvious fact that the president did not know enough, did not know what he didn’t know,\ndid not particularly care, and, to boot, was confident if not serene in his unquestioned\ncertitudes. There was now a fair amount of back-of-the-classroom giggling about who had\ncalled Trump what. For Steve Mnuchin and Reince Priebus, he was an “idiot.” For Gary\nCohn, he was “dumb as shit.” For H. R. McMaster he was a “dope.” The list went on.\n\nTillerson would merely become yet another example of a subordinate who believed\nthat his own abilities could somehow compensate for Trump’s failings.\n\nAligned with Tillerson were the three generals, Mattis, McMasters, and Kelly, each\nseeing themselves as representing maturity, stability, and restraint. And each, of course,\nwas resented by Trump for it. The suggestion that any or all of these men might be more\nfocused and even tempered than Trump himself was cause for sulking and tantrums on the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020114",
