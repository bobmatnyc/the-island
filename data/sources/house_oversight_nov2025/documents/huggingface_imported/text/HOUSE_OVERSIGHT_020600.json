It maps out the entirety of China’s overseas “publicity” work, assigns\ndifferent bureaucratic entities with specific tasks, fixes budgets for entities in this\nsystem, and convenes yearly meetings to implement the annual external propaganda\nplan (ASRit kl). The SCIO is commonly known in Chinese both as the Guo Xin\nBan (#i#7s) and Wai Xuan Ban (External Propaganda Office, 447»). The reason for\nthe two names is because it straddles two bureaucratic systems—the party and the\nstate. It is formally under the State Council, but it is also overseen by the Chinese\nCommunist Party’s External Propaganda Leading Group (or EPLG). This bureaucratic\nduality is what the Chinese describe as “one organ, two signboards” (—MILFaAIR IFT),\na reference to the white placards that hang outside the gates of all Chinese institutions\n(in this case giving the appearance of two different institutions, but in reality with\nonly one inside). As such, the SCIO is the administrative office for the EPLG, playing\na coordinating role in the media area similar to that performed by the Central Foreign\nAffairs Office (CFAO, #2447) for the Foreign Affairs Commission (PRABBAS).\n\nNOTES\n1 This body was upgraded from Leading Small Group status in March 2018.\n\n2 These plans are normally classified and only circulated within the Chinese bureaucracies, but\noccasionally they find their way into the public domain.
