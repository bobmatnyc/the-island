I was born in February 1942 in British-\nruled Palestine on a fledgling kibbutz: a cluster of wood-and-tarpaper huts amid\na few orange groves and vegetable fields and chicken coops. It was just across\nthe road from an Arab village named Wadi Khawaret, which disappeared, with\nthe establishment of the State of Israel, when I was six years old.\n\nAs Prime Minister half-a-century later, during my stubborn yet ultimately\nfruitless drive to secure a final peace treaty with Yasir Arafat, there were media\nsuggestions that my childhood years gave me a personal understanding of the\npasts of both our peoples, Jews and Arabs, in the land which each of us saw as\nour own. But that is in some ways misleading. Yes, I did know first-hand that\nwe were not alone in our ancestral homeland. At no point in my childhood was I\never taught to hate the Arabs. I never did, even when, in my years defending the\nsecurity of Israel, I had to fight, and defeat, them. But my conviction that they,\ntoo, needed the opportunity to establish a state came only later, after my many\nyears in uniform, and especially when, as deputy chief-of-staff under Yitzhak\nRabin, we were faced with the explosion of violence in the West Bank and Gaza\nthat became known as the first intifada.

And that, too, was a\npart of my own family’s story. Most of the world’s Jews, who lived in the\nRussian empire and Poland, were trapped at the time in a vise of poverty,\npowerlessness and anti-Semitic violence. Even in the democracies of Western\nEurope, Jews were not necessarily secure. Theodor Herzl, a thoroughly\nassimilated Jew in Vienna, published the foundation text of Zionism in 1896. It\nwas called Der Judenstaat. “Jews have sincerely tried everywhere to merge\nwith the national communities in which we live, seeking only to preserve the\nfaith of our fathers,” he wrote. “In vain are we loyal patriots, sometimes super-\nloyal. In vain do we make the same sacrifices of life and property as our fellow\ncitizens...
