  "text": "Our job, as humans, was to look at the earth and discover things\nabout it. When we looked at light passing through water or built\na boat to travel on it, we were discovering, not inventing. Shipwrights did\nnot invent boats they were simply building inevitable forms. Everything\nthere was to know already existed, we just hadn't realized it yet. Of course,\nGreek playwrights were busy ‘creating the first plays; tragedies, comedies\nand the like, but serious thinkers thought of them as documenting the\nhuman condition. It wasn't until the Renaissance, 1500 years later, that\nhumans began to appreciate that they create knowledge, and this started\nus on our quest to understand creativity.\nOne of my childhood memories is sitting on the kitchen floor with\na glass of water and surrounded by knives and milk bottles. I was trying\nto solve one of the problems from Edward de Bono’s book on lateral\nthinking, A Five-day Course in Thinking. De Bono, now in his 80s, is\na prolific writer with over 60 publications to his name - all aimed at\n\nr Whe ancient Greeks believed there was no such thing as creativity.\n\nmaking us more creative. His books pose a series of practical problems,\neach needing progressively greater creative intelligence. The particular\nproblem I was trying to solve was to balance a glass of water on knives\nsuspended from four milk bottles. It took me after 2 hours.\n\nSteve Jobs shows the iPhone\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015987",
