  "text": "heterosexual female submissive mentor if possible.\n\nThis post was edited to add the next paragraph: \\n the comments, Ranai pointed out that\nit's not always a great idea to have just one mentor -- and I agree with her. I think it's\nhelpful to have a range of voices who can give advice, if possible. There's nothing wrong\nwith trusting one person above others, but all humans have their blind spots, and mentors\nare human too. This is one thing I love about the BDSM community, by the way (or at\nleast, my experience with the BDSM communities I have been part of -- not all BDSM\ncommunities are the same...). In many BDSM communities, there are many cafe meetups\nand other low-pressure gatherings that make perfect environments for getting this kind of\nadvice!\n\n* Not all BDSM -- or porn -- or whatever! -- is the same. If you don't like (or are even\nrevolted by) something you see, then you can try watching (or reading, or talking about)\nsomething else. Me, I got really excited when I first learned about Comstock Films: Tony\nComstock makes documentaries that show real couples having real sex, and his\ndocumentaries are much more realistic and comfortably sexual than mainstream porn.\nAnd I really didn't like mainstream porn. But then I found that I wasn't that into\nComstock Films themselves, even though I love the idea so much that I screened one of\nthe movies at my sex-positive film series. So I concluded that I'm just not into porn at all,\nand that I'd be better off to focus on written erotica.\n\nBut then I finally saw some porn that turned me on at CineKink, \"the really alternative\nfilm festival\" -- and I hadn't even expected it to turn me on! I'd just been watching out of\nacademic interest! And these days, I find that I'm sometimes turned on by watching the\nmainstream porn I tried so hard to avoid in the first place. The moral of the story is\nobvious.\n\nThe bottom line is that mere exposure to new ideas about sexuality can bring personal\nsexual evolution -- and that's awesome. So if you're interested in facilitating your own\nsexual evolution, the first thing to do is learn about sexuality by whatever means possible.\n\nte Kk ok\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/05/28/sexual-openness-2-ways-to-encourage-it/\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\n[storytime] Fear, Loathing, and S&M Sluthood in San Francisco\n\nI originally wrote this and published it at OffOurChests.com in late 2010. If you've read\nConfessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser, or any of my posts that refer to \"Adam,\" then I\nprobably don't have to tell you which of these men later turned into Adam. But I'll spoil\nthe mystery for you, and tell you outright that Mr. Thereltls is Adam. (In this entry, I\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018525",
