To its east,\nit faces only a narrow strip of populated area east of the Jordan. To\nthe north, there is a maritime commercial entity. Syria operating\nalone, forced through the narrow gap of the Mount Hermon-Galilee\nline and operating on extended supply lines, can be dealt with readily.\nThere is a risk of simultaneous attacks from multiple directions.\nDepending on the forces deployed and the degree of coordination\nbetween them, this can pose a problem for Israel. However, even here\nthe Israelis have the tremendous advantage of fighting on interior\nlines. Egypt and Syria, fighting on external lines (and widely\nseparated fronts), would have enormous difficulty transferring forces\nfrom one front to another. Israel, on interior lines (fronts close to\neach other with good transportation), would be able to move its\nforces from front to front rapidly, allowing for sequential engagement\nand thereby the defeat of enemies. Unless enemies are carefully\ncoordinated and initiate war simultaneously — and deploy\nsubstantially superior force on at least one front — Israel can initiate\nwar at a time of its choosing or else move its forces rapidly between\nfronts, negating much of the advantage of size that the attackers\nmight have.\n\nThere is another aspect to the problem of multifront war. Egypt\nusually has minimal interests along the Levant, having its own coast\nand an orientation to the south toward the headwaters of the Nile. On\nthe rare occasions when Egypt does move through the Sinai and\nattacks to the north and northeast, it is in an expansionary mode. By\nthe time it consolidates and exploits the coastal plain, it would be\npowerful enough to threaten Syria. From Syria's point of view, the\nonly thing more dangerous than Israel is an Egypt in control of Israel.\nTherefore, the probability of a coordinated north-south strike at Israel\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031863",
