GIUFFRE, formerly known as Virginia Roberts\n(“Giuffre”), for her Complaint against Defendant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL (“Maxwell”), avers\nupon personal knowledge as to her own acts and status and otherwise upon information and\nbelief:\nNATURE OF THE ACTION\n\n1. This suit arises out of Defendant Maxwell’s defamatory statements against\nPlaintiff Giuffre. As described below, Giuffre was a victim of sexual trafficking and abuse while\nshe was a minor child. Defendant Maxwell not only facilitated that sexual abuse but, most\nrecently, wrongfully subjected Giuffre to public ridicule, contempt and disgrace by, among other\nthings, calling Giuffre a liar in published statements with the malicious intent of discrediting and\nfurther damaging Giuffre worldwide.\n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n2. This is an action for damages in an amount in excess of the minimum\njurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\n3. This Court has jurisdiction over this dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332\n(diversity jurisdiction) as Giuffre and Maxwell are citizens of different states and the amount in\ncontroversy exceeds seventy-five thousand ($75,000), exclusive of interest and costs.\n\n4, This Court has personal jurisdiction over Maxwell. Maxwell resides in New York\nCity, and this action arose, and defamatory statements were made, within the Southern District of\nNew York.\n\n5. Venue is proper in this Court as the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of\n\nthis Court.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015532",
