Africa, parasites, intelligence

To understand intelligence in the tropics, e.g. among dark-skinned Africans, you
need to understand the importance of parasites—both as an environmental factor
that exerts a negative effect on mental development and a positive effect on

selection for biological diversity of all sorts, including intelligence.

1. Taking first the well-known negative effect of parasite load on individual
intelligence—in the US the parallel factor is toxins and also indoor parasites, as in
tenements—the US is now more segregated by race than it was in 1965 and so that
many studies show that there is a strong tendency for whites to live in healthy

environments and blacks inferior habitats.

For Africa, the environmental factor is parasites—disease—known to exert a strong

negative effect on intelligence.

They also exert a very strong positive effect for genetic diversity in their hosts that
may in turn select for some groups excelling in intelligence, even if the mean is

lower—variance is higher.

2--Hominids have always emerged from Africa, erectus, sapiens, sapiens
neanderthalensis and sapiens sapiens, but with trivial exceptions never in the reverse
direction--why? Because Africa is the most genetically variable part of the world,
especially the smaller the organism, hence parasites. African human populations are

invariably more genetically variable than more temperate hominids, including today.

The same rule applies more generally, that is, to almost all species—migration is always

tropics to temperate to arctic, rarely the other way around (e.g. salamanders are the
