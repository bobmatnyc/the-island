  "text": "Chapter Five\n\nAlmost no one in Israel knew what we had done. But the next morning, a\npackage arrived at the Sayeret Matkal base from one of the few people who did.\nWe opened it in Avraham’s office. It was a nearly full carton of champagne:\nreal, French champagne, since it would be years before Israel’s embryonic wine\nindustry produced anything similar. Inside was a note from the chief of staff.\n“For the success of the operation,” General Tzur had written. “Minus two\nbottles... to teach Ehud Brog not to shut off his field radio.”\n\nI assumed that his reprimand was tongue-in-cheek, for the same reason I’d\nescaped being locked up on General Yoffe’s orders as a gasoline thief. Had we\nbeen captured on the Golan, the very future of the sayeret as an operational\nintelligence unit would have been put at risk. Tzur, and Ben-Gurion as well,\nwould have faced a reopening of all the old wounds from the Uri Ilan mission.\nBut not only had we managed to get in and out of Syria in one piece. We had\ntaken at least a first step toward erasing the blind spot in our intelligence\ncapabilities shown up so dramatically by Rotem. A few days later, I received a\nletter from the chief of staff informing me that I was to receive my first tzalash,\nor operational decoration, in recognition of “a mission which contributed to the\nsecurity of the state of Israel.”\n\nMy own feelings were more mixed. I was proud of what I, and my team, had\naccomplished. On a personal level, too, I felt I'd reached an important landmark\non my unlikely journey from the winter morning when I'd arrived as physically\nfrail, awkward kibbutz teenager at APC boot camp in the Negev; through my\nyears of sayeret training under the strict, sometimes sardonic, but always\nsupportive gaze of Israel’s most storied commandos; to, now, having begun to\nmake a real contribution to Avraham’s vision of a new kind of Israeli military\nunit. But while Avraham, General Tzur and our other military and intelligence\nchiefs celebrated our mission, I felt not so much triumph as relief. I didn’t kid\nmyself: I knew that the operation could just as easily have gone wrong. In fact,\nit very nearly did, through errors or omissions I had made. I made that point, in\ngeneral terms, when we joined Avraham and the rest of the sayeret in a formal\ndebriefing. But that very night, just as I had in the days before we set off, I\nwrote down in detail some of the oversights I knew I'd have to correct if we\nwere to succeed in further missions.\n\nWhy hadn’t I chosen a route that took us further away from the Syrian base\nat Banias? How had I let us arrive so unprepared, untrained and unequipped for\n\n72\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027920",
